<TITLE> Summer Reading blues </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-22 06:52:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This summer I was given a summer reading list for my 9th grade Honors English class.I looked through the list and picked out Uncle Toms cabin.I've started reading it but haven't been able to get into the book.I don't know if its just what happens with most books where the begining starts out slow or is it just the time of when I am reading it and the reason why I am reading it ? Has anyone else experienced this ?
Thanks </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think a prison architect stream would be the best way to replay the game.Not an everyday thing just maybe once or twice a week would be really nice and a good break in the usual content </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really like the new youtube streaming channel but will games still be saved on twitch?
I would like to see things like Eurotruck where there is copyrighted music saved to both Youtube and Twitch.On Twitch copyrighted music is much more lenient and then  people on mobile can still watch non music edition on Youtube . </TEXT>
