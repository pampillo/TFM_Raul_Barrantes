<TEXT> You have to introduce some kind of moisture somewhere in the cooking process.  Straight grilling or baking in the oven won't achieve what you're trying for.  You can use water, juice, beer etc.  You really don't want to cook them until they fall off the bone.  Points are taken away in competition for that.  Try to find that sweet spot where they adhere to the bone but easily come off when eaten.  Most people use the 3-2-1 but it's not an exact science.  Happy Ribbin'    </TEXT>

<TEXT> I find it interesting that people equate race with nationality.  Here in Texas a lot of our best Japanese chefs are from Mexico which is not surprising if you know the political mandates and laws that were passed in the US and Mexico.

<TEXT> I'll take some pics and post soon.  In the meantime, tell your German friend that Texas has a long and close history with the German and Czech people.  Our beloved Chicken Fried Steak is based on Schnitzel.  Our best Brewery's were originally owned by Germans immigrants.  There was a time when some small towns in Texas printed their newspapers in German and after a century had passed,  European German speakers couldn't make hide nor hair what the locals Germans were saying!   Here's a link to one of the original German restaurants.  http://kubys.com/about-us/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> The original ratatouille recipe had the vegetables fried before baking. Since at least 1976, top French chefs have prepared the ratatouille vegetables in thin slices instead of the traditional rough-cut.[citation needed] Michel Gurard, in his book founding cuisine minceur (1976),[3] recreated lighter versions of the traditional dishes of nouvelle cuisine.[4] His recipe Confit bayaldi, differed from ratatouille by not frying the vegetables, removing peppers and adding mushrooms.

American celebrity chef Thomas Keller first wrote about a dish he called "byaldi" in his 1999 cookbook, The French Laundry Cookbook.[5] Keller's variation of Gurard's added two sauces, a tomato and peppers sauce at the bottom (piprade), and a vinaigrette at the top.[6][7] He served as food consultant to the Pixar film Ratatouille, allowing its producer, Brad Lewis, to intern for two days in the kitchen of his restaurant, The French Laundry. Lewis asked Keller how he would cook ratatouille if the most famous food critic in the world were to visit his restaurant.[1] Keller decided he would make the ratatouille in confit byaldi form, and fan the vegetable rounds accordion-style with a palette knife.[8] - Wikipedia </TEXT>

<TEXT> Recipe:

4 oz bacon, diced and cooked
2 oz Swiss cheese, shredded
1 blind baked pie shell
4 eggs
1 pt milk
4 oz heavy cream
salt and pepper, to taste
pinch of nutmeg

Place the bacon and shredded cheese in the baked pie shell.

To make the custard, combine the eggs, milk and cream, and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg.

Pour the custard over the bacon and cheese and bake at 350F until the custard is cooked, approximately 1 hour.

I used a large quiche/tart pan but a 9 in pie pan can also be used. </TEXT>

<TEXT> During and after the US Vietnam war many refugees were located in specific areas in the US.  Texas was one of them.  I lived in a three story bottom-floor apartment in the 70's and the two (three bedroom) apartments above housed a total of 17 Vietnamese.  Their rent was subsidized by churches and their church buses would pick them up every Sunday,  then drop them off.  Guess what?  Every religious holiday they celebrated that was not Christian, they celebrated above our apartment.  We even had a white guy that sold Vietnamese food out of the back of a U-haul in our apartment lot!  Still love the cuisine!!          </TEXT>

Notes:
1.  If you don't want to use a grinder just use 1 1/2 lbs ground beef, 1 lbs ground pork, add flavor packet and let sit overnight.
2.  Add the remaining fennel seeds and chili flakes to the glaze.
3.  The panade is the bread mixture.
4.  The leftover drippings make a wonderful tomato gravy.  </TEXT>

1/4 cup white vinegar,
1-2 Tsp Dawn detergent,
1/4 cup Arm   Hammer "washing soda"  found in the cleaning isle.  Don't substitute baking soda, not the same thing!,
2 gal hot water.

Mix until bubbly.  A little goes a long way.  Don't use on waxed floors, JS.  

Maybe invest in a good steam cleaner and use after mopping.  Steam works great to help to kill bacteria too!   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's most of the recipes:

Coconut Shrimp

1. Shell (leave the tail), devein and butterfly 1-lbs of 21/26 fresh shrimp.  Thoroughly dry with paper towels.
2.  Set up 3 bowls.  First bowl with 1/2 cup flour, 1 Tsp cayenne or ground red pepper, 1/2 Tsp of cracked black pepper.  Second bowl with 3/4 cup pancake batter or Bisquick and 3/4 cup flat beer.  Third bowl with 2 cups coconut flakes either sweetened or not.
3.  Take each shrimp and dip into 1st bowl, shake excess off.  Dip into 2nd bowl, let drip or shake off excess then place in 3rd bowl with the cut side spread open and down then cover with coconut and press lightly to gently stick.  Place each shrimp, tail side up, onto a pan lined with wax paper and lightly coated with coconut.  
4.  Refrigerate for 1/2 hour or freeze for future use. (If freezing, make sure shrimp aren't touching)
5.  Heat deep-fat fryer to 350F.  Holding the shrimp by the tail, lower until the shrimp is covered with oil and then carefully hold for 30 seconds then let drop into the fryer.  Fry for 3 +/- minutes if refrigerated until golden brown.  (If frozen,  fry until golden brown then place in an oven to finish cooking the shrimp.  Drain on paper towels and serve.  

Caribbean Hushpuppies

  At this point I had batter, flour and coconut leftover so I just mixed them until I had the proper consistency and using one spoon to gather about a Tbsp and another to drop it off into the hot oil,  I fried them until they floated.

I served this with a tropical "Pasta from Hell",  spicy dipping banana sauce and Key Lime Pie.  Recipe provided on request.

<TEXT> An American black female who was in my command when I was in the Navy jumped all over her white, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, male shipmate when he casually mentioned he was an African-American.  She couldn't grasp the difference between country of origin/nationality vs race.  She also went so far as to prevent another shipmate from listening to a radio program that she found offensive when she happened to drop by his work station.  Seems she didn't like it hearing Louis Farrahkan referred to as "Calypso Louie" by the black radio host, Ken Hamblin and no, she was not Muslim.  So much for protecting the Constitution and the rights of free speech!      </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The prescription was for an opioid pain patch.  I used it for 1 week before I realized it was 7 months past its expiration date.  I don't think I suffered any ill affects and they, happily and apologetically replace the medication.  I'm not looking for a lawsuit/money but I'm concerned because this chain pharmacy has been caught and fined for selling expired OTC medication and food items in another state.  It may have been an honest mistake but because of their previous lawsuit and the fact it was a prescription drug that could have had serious consequences I feel I'm responsible to report it.    </TEXT>

I found an extension cord, split the two wires apart and stripped both ends of one wire.  Found a willing soul and we positioned the cars so that the bumpers touched to create a ground then, with both cars off, I clamped one bare end to the positive terminal from one battery then did the same with the other.  Started car one, let it run, then started mine.  Fired right up!  Can't do that anymore! </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're welcome.  The best advise I got from a cajun and chili-head is make sure every layer you add to a dish adds either flavor or texture.  For instance, instead of adding just water, even if you're just making Kraft Mac and Cheese, add chicken stock instead of water.  Add some of your spices at the beginning but leave some to throw in at the end.  For texture add some of your veggies from the beginning for aromatics but add additional toward the end for taste and texture.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> As an old cook in the Navy I say job well done mate!  I like just a little glaze on mine so I can admire the rings of filling and golden brown rolls but that just my preference.  

I think your portioning was okay but doing it your way makes it hard to get a nice clean slice without "sealing" the cut edges.  This is one reason rolls will bolt up in the middle.                         Before you cut the rolls, refrigerate it covered in plastic for 15 minutes.  This firms up the dough and butter so it won't squish down and the filling doesn't squeeze out.  Using your handy dandy ruler mat as a guide and a very sharp long knife cut your rolls while using your other hand to gently maintain the shape of the roll.  Try not to end up with a  shaped roll but if you do just lightly lay it down and round it out.
Use a bigger pan.  Your rolls are too close together!  They should almost double in size with the second rising.  Also, when you originally roll the dough up, do so as loosely as you can.  That will allow the rolls to expand.  Roll it too tight and they won't proof correctly and can also cause the middle to bolt up.
Just some words of advise from an old salty cook.  Can't wait to see the next batch!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> True. Most homeowners/renters insurance covers loss of power usually up to $500.  Don't know if they would cover it because of a defective refrigerator though.  When I lost power for barely over 24 hours I called my insurance company.  They did not send an adjuster out, just began asking what I'd lost.  Rattled off a bunch of expensive cheeses, charcuterie, shellfish, all kinds of imported olives etc.  She asks if I'm a chef, "yes", I tell her and bingo, she awards me the full amount!  Pretty much just had the basics, less than $75.   I know, I'm bad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I went to a grocery store in San Diego to purchase a money order.  When I got home I realized I had $100 too much and the clerk must have messed up the transaction so my husband and I went back and told the clerk.  He called his supervisor and they counted down the register but no discrepancies showed up.  We went on to shop in the store and as we were about to check out the clerk ran up to us and said they finally found the discrepancy and his manager had offered us 2 free deli sandwiches for the $$$.  I could have messed with this young man but I gave him the $100.00 back knowing that if I made a mistake like that it would have been a god-send for a customer to return a $100.00 mistake except that it wasn't a god-send since I'm an Atheist and have empathy for someone in that position.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, this one I did all by myself.  At my first duty station I made some pie dough using the Armed Forces Recipe Cards.  It listed every ingredient on the front except for water.  I made what I thought looked like a perfect pie dough for 300 portions of Cobbler.  Refrigerated it before rolling it out, it then rolled out beautifully with no cracks and baked off to a perfect golden brown.  I didn't discover how important a little bit of water was until they tried to cut up the pie and the crust instantly turned to dust!   </TEXT>

<TEXT> On a destroyer I was stationed on we had 4 five gallon buckets of used fryer oil stored on the deck in the galley that was all of about 150 sq ft.  We were expecting high-speed maneuvers that day and secured everything we possibly could however, no one thought to check that the lids were tight and the buckets could not move around.  All four buckets spilled at the same time.  Since this was a ship we first had to stop as much of the oil from going down the drain and scoop up as much oil as possible all the while the ship was still in maneuvers, left then right at angles of about 30 degrees.  This happened right after securing for lunch.  Took about four hours to finally clean up the mess and we still managed to prepare dinner in time.  Everyones fault because no one checked.  Wish someone had been able to make a video!

<TEXT> Yes, it was a version that a young couple brought to Austin in 1972 to people that never heard of a muffuletta.  The big difference is the bread and olive tapenade. 

I worked at a Schlotsky's in Jr High School in 1981 when it was all about the sandwich.  The bread was delivered in the mornings fully baked so the recipe was kept secret.  
Schlotsky's bread is what sets it apart from a Muff. and I should know since I lived there for nine years.  Muffs use a round Italian.  Schlotz uses a recipe that combines a Sourdough starter with a  English muffin type bread and they are very protective of the recipe! </TEXT>

<TEXT>  There's a historical explanation for this.  The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 effectively stopped all immigration from China to the US and many Chinese who were already here were not allowed to return if they left the US who still had family here.  
 This caused many Chinese to immigrate to Mexico where many opened restaurants or became street vendors.  In the meantime, the Chinese practically invented human smuggling to the US.  
 Consequently the Mexicans, particularly along the border have developed a particularly refined palate for Chinese/Asian food.  Most of the best Chinese/Japanese restaurants in Texas employ a Chef Martinez or Chef Rodriquez as head chef.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> When guys say that what they really mean is they believe women can't handle the pressure of being a professional in the industry.
  
To them their mother probably made the best whatever.  With a few exceptions, no one could make it like she could.  Mom was always depicted at being able to cook the perfect Thanksgiving turkey with all the sides plus desserts for 20 family members and look good while doing it in heals! Plus FOH duties which included the table settings and seasonal decor.  Women were perfectly suited to cook in the home for family and manage organizational stress but never in the Big Ole' Capitalist Marketplace.

We're just delicate flowers that need squashi....'er protection.  News Flash...--.--..Women are as capable as men in working under pressure either in Food Service or as US Navy Combat fighters.

 It's a perception thing that screws women out of a fair wage.  Women can be wonderful cooks and great organizers but not when it comes to being a professional because only men are perceived that can do that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While I like the passage you refer to it does not reflect a true sacrifice.  Much like the Peter Pan story, everyone must give up their childhood in order to become an adult.  What Jesus was saying here was not to love your earthly existence but to instead look forward to an everlasting life with God.  If that is the case then there was no sacrifice since the inevitable outcome was to become something greater.  A true sacrifice means a loss without compensation and that never happened with the Crucifixion of Jesus.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was an Admiral's cook at a Flag Mess.  Worked many parties at his quarters.  When the parties started to wind down his wife, who herself held a high level civilian position in DC,  would come back into the kitchen, tell me to grab a "drink" and we would go out back to talk, smoke and commiserate.  She hated most of the O wives.  Most down to earth woman I've ever met.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's no big secret how to make your own.  Take cubed steak and pound the shit out of it till it looks like it wrestled with a waffle iron and lost.  

Season 2 cups of flour with the seasoning of your choice.  I like "Slap Yo Momma".  In a second container mix 1 1/2 cups buttermilk, 2 Tsp baking powder, 1 Tsp baking soda and 1 egg, garlic and hot sauce.  Coat in flour,  then dredge in the buttermilk mixture and place back into the flour.
  
Very Important...when you coat it the second time make sure you thoroughly pat the flour into the steak until it feels dry.  Place your steaks on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper and dusted with flour.  Refrigerate up to an hour until you're ready to fry em up.  This step is not necessary but I feel it makes a crispier crust and gives you time to clean.  Fry at 325F in 1/2 inch oil about for 6 to 8 minutes on each side.

Use 2 Tbsp of the leftover oil and pan drippings to make a cream gravy.  

You've done it all right if you don't need a knife to cut it or teeth to chew it for that matter!      </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your Dracaena Marginata is not happy! Marginata's need water but not a lot and do not let them dry out.   Good news!  It's perfectly normal for a DM to loose its lower leaves as it grows.  If it's a matter of too little watering you will see brown dead leaves scattered all over.  The brown tips you see are usually caused by salt damage.  This can happen a number of ways but it can be prevented by watering the DM enough so that water drains out  the bottom and flushes the salts out.  If you let this plant sit in its own water runoff especially its own "waste" then it will uptake the salt and will burn the ends.  Letting it sit in water for any length of time will also lead to stem and fungal rot.   Make sure all the soil is saturated when water when you do water.  Sometimes a rootball will dry up to the point that water doesn't penetrate and just leaks around it so use your best judgement.  Marginatas need water and don't like to ever dry out but they also cannot stand to be left in standing water.   So it looks like this guy need to be repotted because I'm seeing some roots and the pot is too small for the plant.  Choose a pot that is no more than 2 inches bigger than the original and had drainage.  Don't fertilize.  After transplanting use a weak solution of root starter.  Again, don't freak out if it loses for leaves.  At this point you want to grow roots, not leaves.  BTW,  just cut off the ends of the leaves at an angle.  Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cream of 'insert here' soup was a Capitalistic plot by Campbell's Soup Company to promote their product plus really bad recipe books following WWII which, because of convenience for the average housewife, led to a decrease in cooking skills.  

 This lead to the eventual low standards of the American palate that grew up to believe that condensed tomato soup from a can was normal and Hmm, Hmm good!  

 Eventually no one knew how to make a sauce, roux or soup  without Campbell's condensed soup.  Except for people in New Orleans and surrounding areas.

 They seemed to have been influenced by Communists to resist the Capitalists influence of convenience foods and instead what they had growing in their backyard or local market.  This is well documented by the Warren Report that outlined the Communist presence and their influence on Lee Harvey Oswald but I digress.

 An entire generation was born and raised not knowing how to cook and their only crutch continued to be Campbell's soup and even crappier cookbooks in the 60's complete with jello molds (but that's another story).  Things would change in the 70's though!

 As early as 1931 the first edition of "The Joy of Cooking" was published but was mostly ignored by home cooks.  After it's 6th edition in 1975 its popularity suddenly exploded and sales sky-rocketed.  This seemed to beat all logic but a book published a little earlier explains why.

  In 1972, A book titled "The Joy of Sex" was published that proved enormously popular even though it had illustrations of hairy hippies.  I have to say at this point that that those illustrations were my first visualizations of sex.  I really couldn't actually describe what I thought sex was at that age but the JOS made it perfectly plain and more important that it sex was not scary, but I digress again.  Sorry.

  It's my theory that the "Joy of Cooking" became popular after the "Joy of Sex" was published because if the JOS worked for you then the FOC would too.  Makes perfect sense.  Sex then food!

Please don't get me started about how Spam ruined Hawaiian cuisine!   </TEXT>

<TEXT> If this were presented to me back in culinary school, as in, here is some oranges, make a soup I would have done this.

Segmented one orange into perfect skinless segments.  Set aside.

Juice two oranges and strain.  Add orange juice to equal amounts plain yogurt.  To that add a flavor packet of fresh ground coriander, 1 clove, 1/4 tsp fresh ground nutmeg, 1 tsp tahini  and 1/2 tsp finely ground red pepper flakes. 

Place 3 or 5 segmented oranges in a shallow soup bowl.  Pour the orange mixture (cold or heated) over the segments but don't completely cover.

Garnish with a dollop of creme fraiche and some cilantro leaves.  Sprinkle some Kosher salt over the top.


That's what I'd do.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hopefully, within the next 40 years, enough for a generation or two to die out, the US will fulfill our founder's hopes and become the Constitutional Republic they envisioned and fought for.  

US Government 101:

The US Constitution is not based on religion.  The US is not a Theocracy.

The US government is not based on direct democracy or the idea of "the majority rules".  Our Constitution specifically spelled out and defended the rights of the minority against the majority if it conflicted with the constitution.  This is evident by the separation of powers within the government that the people elect.

Democracy=theocracy is a non-gratis and makes no sense!  Although I know that many Republicans would love to convince the country that that isn't the case! LOL </TEXT>

Humans tend to gain this sense at a very young age before they can formulate an understanding of morality or ethics.  Empathy is an innate property of what humanity is and some other species are.  It also is the very heart of the "Golden Rule" which most religions will say they are based on even if the end results show that the original meanings where corrupted.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Try a hard to semi-hard cheese such as gruyere, parmesean, swiss, cheddar, gouda or mozzarella.  You want it to melt but not so much that it disappears.   

Don't buy pregrated cheese.  It's coated with a substance that keeps the individual pieces from sticking together in the bag but inhibits the melting effect.  Buy whole block and grate the cheese you choose with a medium grate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my opinion I think it is a combination of circumstances. 

 Many high schools do not spend much time teaching evolution if at all.  HS biology classes are usually not taught by a teacher with a degree in biology.  My own HS biology class was taught by an athletic coach.  

 Many people do actively try to sabotage the teaching of evolution.  Here in Texas the Texas Board of Education uses a citizen review board to recommend changes to textbooks.  Most of these people are not experts and some have explicit agendas such as the dumbing down of evolution or including warning stickers indicating that it's only "a theory".  Because Texas is such a big state and textbook publishing is such a big business, changes can effect the industry nationwide.

 The most devastating element to the teaching of evolution and education in general is the mindless cloning of textbook material by large corporate publishers who rely on the endless, thoughtless coping from texts going back decades and not bothering to update new scientific ideas and evidence. Laziness or sloth for profit is still a sin last time I checked!

<TEXT> The best recipe you can use is the stovetop recipe from 'The Best Recipe' book which are collections of kitchen tested recipes from the 'Cook Illustrated' magazine. I've made this recipe many, many times for small and large groups and it always comes out perfect with a silky smooth finish. The secret is using evaporated milk which stabilizes the cheese sauce and you don't have to keep it cold till you need it. Don't forget the can opener though!

If you only have one camp stove and stock pot you'll need to make a slight modification but it shouldn't be a problem. You'll just need a small butane blow torch. The first amounts are for 6 side portions or 4 main dish and the second for 48 side or 32 main.

Mac   Cheese

Topping (opt) 1 1/2/4 cups dry bread crumbs pinch/1 tsp salt 1 1/2 /4 Tbps softened butter

Mac and Cheese

2 / 16 large eggs 1 / 8 (12oz) can evaporated milk 1/4 / 2 tsp hot red pepper sauce 2 tsp / 5Tbps,1/4 tsp salt 1/4 / 2 tsp ground black pepper 1 / 8 tsp dry mustard, dissolved in 1 / 8 tsp water to activate. 8 oz / 4 lb dry elbow or shell pasta 4 Tbps / 2 cups unsalted butter 12 oz / 6 lbs grated cheese, I use 1 part sharp cheddar, 1 part swiss, 1 part fontina and 1 part velveeta

For Mac   Cheese 1. Mix eggs, 1 cup / 8 cups evaporated milk, pepper sauce, 1/2 / 4 tsp salt, pepper and mustard mixture together in a bowl and set aside.

    Bring 2 qts or enough for 4 lbs pasta to a boil in the stock pot. Add remaining salt and pasta. Cook until almost tender but still firm to the bite. Drain, retaining some of the pasta water, and return to pan over low heat, Add butter and toss to melt.

    Pour egg mixture over buttered pasta along with three-quarters of the cheese; stir until thoroughly combined and cheese start to melt. Gradually add remaining milk and cheese, stirring constantly, until mixture is hot and creamy, about 5 minutes. Make sure the utensil you use to stir is long enough to reach the bottom and preferably has a flat end.

    Pour Mac   Cheese into serving containers.

For the topping;

    Mix the bread crumbs with the salt.

    With a gloved hand. Mix the softened butter with the bread crumbs. Sprinkle crumbs over Mac   Cheese.

    Using a butane torch, carefully brown the top.

Love the Mac   Cheese bar idea! Happy Camping! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I originally posted the pics at r/military.  I posted this to r/neckbeards at their urging.

Most of the comments I've read were positive.  The few that were negative mostly took pock-shots at my calling my son out.  Sorry but believe it or not, every parent of a NB or almost a NB should shame their NB.  Being a NB is not something to aspire to!  

Having to ask my adult son to make sure his door to his room was closed when I had company come over didn't make me love him less and he always knew that I was trying to impart a sense of cleanliness when I made him clean his room once every 3 months.  

For all off the NB's out there, you should feel good that he won't suffer your fate LOL!  

I just know that the military will instill that into him and all the negative NB's can kiss my ass!     </TEXT>

2.  Bring 2 qts or enough for 4 lbs pasta to a boil in the stock pot.  Add remaining salt and pasta.  Cook until almost tender but still firm to the bite.  Drain, retaining some of the pasta water, and return to pan over low heat, Add butter and toss to melt.

3.  Pour egg mixture over buttered pasta along with three-quarters of the cheese; stir until thoroughly combined and cheese start to melt.  Gradually add remaining milk and cheese, stirring constantly, until mixture is hot and creamy, about 5 minutes.  Make sure the utensil you use to stir is long enough to reach the bottom and preferably has a flat end.

4.  Pour Mac   Cheese into serving containers.

For the topping;

1.  Mix the bread crumbs with the salt.

2.  With a gloved hand.  Mix the softened butter with the bread crumbs.  Sprinkle crumbs over Mac   Cheese.

3.  Using a butane torch, carefully brown the top.  

Love the Mac   Cheese bar idea!  Happy Camping!

I only just now looked at Alton Brown's recipe.  All that typing for nothing lol.

<TEXT> Even when I was religious I'd tell people that God helps those that (try to) help themselves.  That being said, you first need to lose your defeatist inner talk.  Everyone has set-backs in their life.  I doubt everything in yours was bad.  

You obviously know how to use a computer.  My homeless uncle and brother never bothered to learn and it's crippling them plus they are felons.  Are you a felon?  If not then be proud and thankful.  

When you put your kids to bed tonight look straight into each one of their eyes and try to imagine the strong loving person they see.  Then, before you go to bed, look back at yourself in the mirror and realize that you ARE the strong, confident and loving parent that they see and you ARE even if you don't believe it!

<TEXT> Had to share an office with our Food Service Officer, an O2.  He would sit for hours quietly staring at the same 2 pages from the NAVSUP-486 and no, he was not sleeping.  He went to a conference with our Chief.  He took a run in his dress socks that morning because he forgot his regular socks then showed up at the conference with no socks on.   Chief had to sit behind him where his lack of socks was clearing visible to everyone.  

At least once a week Chief would come into our office and tell me to take a break.  I'd always grab my smokes because I knew he'd be in there balling him out for a while.

The worst for me was when he changed into his whites in a small closet that was behind a partition on the other side of my desk.  In all fairness he did ask if this was okay.  He then tells me while he's changing that he accidentally wore dark underwear and would just have to go without!       </TEXT>

<TEXT> This has become standard and I don't know why.  Telephones are inherently intrusive.  You aren't asking to be called and you have no obligation to identify yourself when you receive a phone call.  Back in the day, all callers would identify themselves first.  Me, "Hello".  Them, "I'm so and so from/with so and so, may I speak with so and so?" or informally, "it's me Jan".  You never got a call from anyone that asked you to identify yourself first!  Awkward call example.....

*Ring*  Answers the phone, "Hello".  Caller, "Hello, who is this?".  Me, "Who are you trying to call?".  Caller, "I'm trying to reach so and so".

Even more ridiculous examples are,  Me,"Hello".  Caller, "Is this so and so?".  Me, "Who's calling please?"   

The bottom line is that calling someone is no different then knocking on someone's front door.  It's polite and moreover safe to identify yourself first than ask for the person behind the door to identify themselves.     </TEXT>

<TEXT> Never add flour directly into a simmering or boiling liquid.  Sorry sean_incali.  It's guaranteed to form clumps and won't properly thicken.  

You can either coat the beef cubes with flour before you brown them which essentially produces a roux (preferred and will produce a nice crust) or you can bullf* k it, as we called it in the Navy, by making a beurre manie, which is simply equal parts butter to flour that is mixed well then added by the spoonful.   

The thickening ratio depends on how much liquid you use but generally it's 10 to 1, liquid to roux or beurre manie.  So, if you use ten cups of stock then you will need 1 cup of roux or BM.  Cornstarch is different. 1 oz of cornstarch + 1 oz water will thicken 16 oz or 2 cups of liquid.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> If Christians were to follow the true teachings of Jesus then they would have to turn their backs on their own families as he and his own followers did.  They wouldn't hesitate to break up families and leave them destitute as the apostles that had wives and children.  They would shun all gainful employment and any material ownership. 

If you have a problem with this I'd be more than willing to debate you both philosophically or by verse but the later could become problematic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First off, congratulations on your promotion!  

Pasta is generally boiled in heavily salted water because it usually contains no salt.  If it's made in-house and salt is already added then you can skip it.  

If I'm blanching vegetables for a crudites platter I will add some salt but not "like the sea".  If I'm doing it to set the color or turgidity and then using the veg in another preparation I won't use any salt.  

I've never heard that salted water affects the absorption rate but even if it did it would be negligible.  

On a side note, there are some vegetables that I will directly put salt on to pull the water out such as thinly sliced cabbage for a wilted but crunchy coleslaw or slices of eggplant before I fry them.  

For the time being do whatever your chef tells you to do.  

In the meantime it may help to study food science in order to understand the "whys" of cooking.  Understanding the basic chemistry involved will help tremendously; from saving a broken Hollandaise sauce, making pancakes without baking powder or preventing the blueberries from turning green.  It will make you an infinitely better chef!  Harold McGee has written several great books on the subject.  

Sounds like you already have good instincts and aren't afraid to question the "wisdom" of so-called chefs.  Just make sure that if you do that you do it respectfully and have the goods to back it up!   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I read the article then read all the comments below then laughed my ass off! 

The comparisons to teamwork in the military and and being able to anticipate and communicate ("behind you!, knife!, hot pan!) in a civi kitchen are spot on.  The military has it's own culture and nomenclature and so does a kitchen.  There is a smooth and rhythmic order to small kitchens that is hard to define along with all the chaotic disruptions that invariably happen. 

  I liken it to a dance and when everyone knows and hears the same notes and all the instruments are ready then beautiful songs happen.  

When you refer to your small station in a kitchen as a battle station, I can relate.   

You see, I'm the real deal.  I was a Navy cook/caterer/chef for Admirals/Generals for 18 years on both ships and aircraft.  I'm also a veteran of several civilian restaurants before, during and after my military career.  

A Battle Station is not much different then a cooking station.  Mine was in a small room called a Battle Dressing Station.  Although my rate was a cook I knew where everything was and was trained to use it.  We always kept it clean and stocked!

As far as being on your feet for 12 hours, try doing it in Combat boots instead of Crocs.

There is nothing in the civilian restaurant world that compares to cooking in a cramped Navy galley.  The Junior Officer that happens to be your clueless Food Service Officer that insists that the fryer be used for french fries for lunch during high speed turns at sea and your just trying best to stay vertical or the CO that expects the galley to feed 250 people in one hour right after battle stations even though all the cooks were at their battle stations and not in the galley!  

Military cooks do it under fire and sometimes we fire back.  Civilians cooks, however, are probably the closest I've seen to military "brothers in arms".

<TEXT> The best I can do is surmise how to recreate it so here goes.

Make some yeast-raised donut or enriched sweet dough.  Fry until golden and let drain.  Brown some ground beef making sure you break it up into very small pieces.  Add a cheese sauce and whatever other seasoning or ingredients you want.  Let cool slightly.  Using a pastry bag with a long but big enough tip, pipe the mixture into the donut like you would do for a jelly donuts.   Brush top with butter or some sort of glaze, maybe honey mustard and sprinkle with chopped cooked bacon.  

Unfortunately for my cholesterol level, I'll be trying this myself!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seasoning mixes of all kinds.  Taco, Creole/Cajun, Italian, Chinese 5 spice, Garam Marsala and curry powder all come to mind.  Convenient yes but also awful and more often than not, overly loaded with salt and/or sugar.  Even seasoned salt is better made from scratch.  

Some individual ingredients in these mixes are so much better if they are freshly toasted or ground and for some recipes, certain spices should be added at different times in the preparation process.

<TEXT> Cheese on french fries is pretty common across the States.  There are variations such as Irish Nachos, cheese over thick-cut potato chips or Frito Pie, cheese and chili over Frito corn chips.  Doing the same with gravy, not a variation. 

You couldn't cover tortilla chips in gravy and get away with calling it Nachos.    Poutine; however, is a different dish altogether and a mighty tasty one at that!

<TEXT> Recipe for cheesecake:

Ingredients

    Nonstick vegetable spray
    1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, divided use
    1/2 pound bacon, cooked, drained, and crumbled (reserve 2 Tablespoons of fat)
    1 onion, diced
    2 apples, peeled, cored, and diced
    2 cloves garlic, minced
    Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
    32 ounces (4 large blocks) cream cheese, at room temperature
    5 eggs
    3 Tablespoons wine vinegar
    1/4 cup whiskey
    12 ounces blue cheese, crumbled
    2 Tablespoons minced chives
    Sliced fresh apples, toast wedges, and/or assorted cocktail crackers

    Prep Time: 20 minutes
    Cook Time: 495 minutes

Preparation

Preheat oven to 200 F. Coat a 9-inch springform pan with vegetable oil spray. Dust with 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan cheese. Set aside.

Saute onion in bacon fat until softened and translucent. Add apples and garlic and continue to saute over medium heat an additional 2 to 3 minutes until apples begin to soften. Remove from heat and season with salt and pepper. Let cool.

Beat the cream cheese in a large bowl until smooth. Add eggs, wine vinegar, and whiskey, beating until smooth. Stir in apple mixture, bacon, blue cheese, remaining Parmesan cheese, and chives by hand.

Pour batter into prepared pan and place in the preheated oven. Let bake overnight for 8 to 9 hours (timing is not critical). It should be fairly firm and slightly browned. Remove from oven and cool on a rack at least 1 hour.

Cover the top of the cooled cheesecake with plastic wrap. Place an inverted plate over the top, turn it over, and remove the pan. Refrigerate the upside-down cheesecake at least 1 hour. Reinvert the cheesecake and remove plastic wrap. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour.

To serve as an appetizer, cut slices with a knife dipped in warm water and garnish with fresh apple slices, toast wedges, and/or cocktail crackers of choice.

Yield: 10 to 12 servings

Recipe for wine gelee:

 To make one 6-inch cheesecake:  Unmold the cheesecake and wrap it in a parchment-paper collar that extends 1 inch above the surface; secure with tape. Pour 1/2 cup of one of the wines into a bowl; if using ros or Pinot Noir, add 1 tablespoon of sugar. Microwave at high power for about 30 seconds, or until the sugar is dissolved. In a small bowl, sprinkle 1 1/2 teaspoons of gelatin over 1 1/2 tablespoons of water and let soften. Heat at high power for 15 seconds, or until the gelatin is melted. Add it to the wine and let stand until slightly thickened but not set, about 10 minutes. Pour the wine gele over the cheesecake and refrigerate for about 1 hour, or until set. Remove the paper collar before serving.

<TEXT> Flank steak is also referred to here as a London Broil LOL!  It's very lean and requires a cooking method usually involving braising if cooking it whole or cutting very thin strips across the grain with a quick saute as in fajitas. Skirt steak or top round could be a substitute.  

You could use pork belly but it has a lot more fat so I would brown it off first to render some of the fat away and then braise or slow cook it. Good luck and thanks for the laugh!   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Chicken Spaghetti

5oz spaghetti noodles, dried or 12oz cooked
1 Tbls butter
1 Tbls bacon grease
1 large onion, med diced
1 bell pepper, med diced
10 to 12 med white or crimini mushrooms, sliced thick
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 tsp Worchestershire sauce
2 tsp dark chili powder
1 Tbls all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups chicken stock
3 ripe Roma tomatoes, chopped
1/2 cup Chili sauce (not the Asian kind)
3/4 cup half   half or heavy cream
1 Tbls parsley, dried or 2 Tbls, fresh
2 cups diced or shredded cooked chicken, preferably not canned
1/2 cup sliced pimiento-stuffed green olives
2 cups med cheddar cheese (8oz), grated

1. Cook the spaghetti in a large amount of heavily salted water.  Drain. Do not rinse. Set aside.
2. Heat the butter and bacon grease in a large skillet over medium heat.  Cook onions, bell pepper and mushrooms until onions are translucent. Add garlic, Worcestershire and chili powder.  Cook for 1 more minute.
3.  Sprinkle in the flour and stir to incorporate well. Let cook for 1 minute stirring constantly to prevent burning the 'roux'.
4. Add the chicken stock, diced tomatoes and chili sauce. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook for 30 minutes, until slightly thickened. 
5. Remove from heat. Stir in half   half, olives, parsley and chicken.  Stir to incorporate well.  Add spaghetti and cheese and toss well. Return pan to med low heat until it bubbles slightly and cheese melts but do not let boil.

This recipe can be made up to step 5 without adding the chicken and cheese then layered and baked casserole style in a greased baking dish at 350F for 25 minutes. Spaghetti, chicken, cheese and repeat but I feel this is unnecessary.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The french bread used for po-boys in New Orleans. Almost impossible to find anywhere else and I've found no recipe that successfully recreates it.  Soft and slightly chewy in the inside and so crackly on the outside you will be brushing crumbs off you no matter how careful you are.  It literally makes the sandwich.  No other bread comes close.  There are only 3 bakeries that make it but the best by far is Leidenheimer Baking Co.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> You should really try making fresh ricotta.  All you need is whole milk or 1-2% plus some heavy cream, lemon juice and salt and white pepper.  No need to use raw milk as you have to bring it to a low boil anyway.  

I've made mozz before but I found it's not worth it to me because of the necessity of buying citric acid and rennet which I have no other use for and of course all that stretching.  I prefer to by either whole soft mozz or a block of low-moisture mozz but never the shredded stuff because they coat it with a chemical to prevent it from sticking together which effects its melting quality.  

Have fun and post your results!  </TEXT>

I guess her final suffering was above those that truly could have used compassion.

Rice Krispie   Peanut Butter Cup Brownies

Yield: 18 to 24 brownies

Cook Time: 45 minutes

Total Time: 3 hours
Ingredients:
For Brownie Base:

    3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter
    1 3/4 cups semisweet chocolate chips, divided
    1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
    1/2 cup light brown sugar, packed
    1/2 teaspoon instant espresso powder or 2 tablespoons brewed coffee (optional)
    1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
    3 large eggs
    1 cup all-purpose flour
    8 full-sized peanut butter cups, chopped, or 1 cup mini peanut butter cups

For Crispie Topping:

    1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
    1 1/2 cups creamy peanut butter
    1 tablespoon butter
    1 1/2 cups crisp rice cereal

Directions:

    Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with aluminum foil; spray lightly with cooking spray.
    Combine butter and 3/4 cup chocolate chips in a large microwave safe bowl. Heat on high power for 60 to 90 seconds, stirring every 10 to 15 seconds to prevent scorching. When chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth, stir in sugar and brown sugar. Batter may seem grainy, that's ok.
    Add the coffee or espresso powder and vanilla extract and stir until smooth.
    Whisk in eggs until incorporated. Sprinkle the flour over top and fold until just combined. Stir in 1/2 cup chocolate chips then pour batter into prepared pan.
    Bake for about 25 minutes or until brownies are mostly done. Remove from oven and sprinkle chopped peanut butter cups and remaining 1/2 cup chocolate chips over top, then return to oven and bake for 3 to 4 minutes more. Transfer pan to wire rack to cool.
    Meanwhile, to prepare topping, combine 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips, peanut butter, and butter in a large microwave safe bowl. Heat on high power for 1 minute, stirring every 10 to 15 seconds, until melted and smooth. Add rice cereal and toss to coat. Spread cereal mixture in a smooth layer on top of brownies, then cover and refrigerate for at least 90 minutes or overnight, or until topping is cooled and set before slicing and serving. Brownies will keep, refrigerated in an airtight container, for up to 1 week.

<TEXT> Your doing it wrong!!  Hamberogology dictates that the greens, especially whole lettuce leafs be placed under the burger but above the lower part of the bun called the "heel" in order to catch the juicy drippings but also to lead them away down your hand and elbow, which may result in a juicy, tasty lick-fest but will also prevent the dreaded soggy, soaked bottom bun.  Shredded lettuce is another topic and will be addressed in my next online school of Hamberogology. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most Christian thought begins with the ideological framework that this planet was made especially by God just for humans.  Mankind was ultimately God's Special Creation and even after the "Fall" mankind was to have dominion of the Earth until mankind had no more use for it because of the Rapture.  

Atheists, Humanists and some religions understand and accept as fact that the world we live in has produced millions of species of animals and plants, most of which (95%) have become extinct.  They do not subscribe to the idea that humans are the pinnacle of all creation but only a fortunate twig that happened to survive in a fairly recent geological fortunate turn of events on the so-called tree of life.

Some Christians label Atheist as arrogant because they believe Atheist see themselves as some sort of god or above a god.

Atheist, on the other hand, view the Christian view that the world exists just for humans arrogant as well. 

What are some Christian perspectives on this subject?

<TEXT> English is a very rich language!  It's why we say we eat beef and pork instead of steer and pig but we say we eat chicken and lamb instead of poultry and baby sheep.  

Basic cooking methods are traditionally divided into two categories, dry heat and moist heat.  Dry heat includes roasting/baking, broiling, pan-frying, saute and deep-fry.  Moist methods include boiling, simmering, poaching, braising, stewing and steaming.  I may have missed a few but it's getting late here.

Souping, currying and gravying are not cooking methods.  You can use varying cooking method to achieve a soup. An example would be braising onions and simmering a veal stock for reduction for a French Onion Soup.  

If I make a soup I may use many techniques but no one would call that "souping"

As for my vegetarian friends.  I sort off appreciate the many ways vegetables have been "disguised" as meat but at the end of the day they aren't and don't have to be cooked the same as "meat".   </TEXT>

<TEXT> To begin with I'm not convinced that the Exodus ever actually occurred but that has no bearing whatsoever on my conclusions.  The lineage of the Jewish people is not based in Egypt.  

Your assertion that most Jews in Israel aren't really Jewish is false.  Anyone today, for as little as a $100 DNA test, can trace their ancestry back to a specific geographical location all over the world.  Interestingly Arabs and Jews have a very close DNA indicating they are from the same stock.

Anywho... your comment about the Jewishness of the Jews in Israel has absolutely no bearing on your assertion of the supposed benevolent principles of Jewish Law and subsequent "tweaking" by Jesus of traditional Hebrew laws.           </TEXT>

<TEXT> "All jewish law is derived from the principles of loving god and loving your neighbor."  I'm throwing down the BS card.

Your statement is about half right.  The Hebrews of the OT may have loved their god but they and their god certainly didn't love their neighbors especially when it was inconvenient for them.  

The majority of Christians are unaware of the atrocities committed by Hebrews (god commanded it or was committed by their god alone) because their Christian education consisted of simplistic Christian children's books, children's bible studies or what their family told them but have never actually read a bible.  Most Christians are woefully ignorant of what the bible actually says and instead of actually reading it they depend on some so-called "expert" such as a preacher, priest or minister to read it and then explain and "interpret" it to them.  

The "golden rule" factor was not and is not a part of the Hebrew faith.  

Case in point, look at what they are doing now. the Christian political dupes who just want to hold onto what political power they have cow-towed to the demands of AIPAC that holds way to much political influence already.   </TEXT>

This god/Jesus person sounds like a narcissistic sociopath, IMO, who only cares whether humanity praises him.

<TEXT> "False, everyone knows God exists, and comes to this conclusion naturally"

Calling the BS flag here. The thing is, if this were even remotely true, you have to be able define the attributes of your particular god before you can have a belief and babies/children do not come by this naturally.  

"The message is restricted because God only plans to save some people."

Your response shows exactly why the OP posted his question.  Your response indicates that your god is only interested in his "chosen people" and doesn't care about other people he had created. From what his "chosen people" have told me they don't want this.

"Allowing sinful creatures to be born so they could be punished is not in itself evil unless you want to argue that justice is evil."

It could be said that your argument justifies the abuse and punishment of every child born.  According to you there is not one innocent baby born.  Obviously you are not a parent and I hope that you never become one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your first statement is completely presumptive.  No one is born knowing a god or gods exist.  They only know what they are exposed to and learn what is expected of them from their culture.  Additionally, no one that "knows" a god exists and understands the consequences would willfully disobey a commandment of a god because of abject fear, unless they were mentally ill but that's another issue. 

Your second premise, that a god is not unjust in not revealing its' nature and expectations to all of humankind because it doesn't owe it to them, doesn't make any sense especially if that god is omnipotent.  Why would the "message" be restricted to only a tiny part of humanity especially if that was the means to salvation?  Why were there "chosen people" in the first place? 

The fact that the early origins of all religions were restricted to isolated groups indicates, not an omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent god/gods, but only a belief system or mythology based on the actual living conditions of the group at that time.

Then again, according to Catholic doctrine, life on this earth is inconsequential and the only import is life after death(oxymoron) and the best way to get a good death/life is to suffer as Jesus did. 

So the masses are told to suffer while the priests live this life high on the hog.

That leads me to the first thing to be cool.  A driver's license.  After that if you were really cool you may have had your own car!  Of course you couldn't show off said car without Facebook so you had to do the the next best thing which was the second coolest thing.

Cruising the lake, beach or local drag on Friday or Saturday was the standard.  Drive-ins were also acceptable but you couldn't blare your favorite cassette featuring AC/DC, Duran Duran, or Cars to name but a few. 

Cheap alcohol, pot and maybe microdot were acceptable but anything harder then that, then you were considered a freak or druggie to be avoided.  

I have to add this, getting knocked up or getting a girl pregnant was not seen as cool or some sort of achievement.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was a server, it was assumed I made 15% from the $'s that I sold and my earnings were reported as income to the IRS whether I received 15% or not.  What I didn't know then is that, as a hourly paid employee who is paid less than minimum wage as most of us are, if our tips don't combine to equal minimum wage then the employer must make up the difference.  

So lets say you're on the clock as a server and no one comes into the restaurant the entire time you've been hired to provide wait-staffing duties.  You are paid $2.86 per hour to be there and you stay there the entire time but never encounter a customer.  The restaurant has to pay minimum wage, $5.75 in some states to make up for their lack of customers while you're on the clock.  This is a little known secret that most places don't want servers to know about. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you're confusing celebration with endorsement neither of which apply to US discrimination laws concerning business practices.  

If I provide a cake for a 10 year olds' birthday I'm neither celebrating nor endorsing the birthday.  I may sincerely believe that his age should include the 9 months of gestation before birth as some cultures do but that's not my place.  I sell cakes and because I choose to sell them to the public in the US I have to adhere to non-discriminationary laws.

Your examples of the photographer fail.  Unless you have the photographer give a thumbs-up in a photo or force a personal statement of endorsement of the marriage you don't have a claim of a  violation of your personal beliefs. Just photographing the event is not an endorsement.

As far as your silly comment about atheist, we absolutely don't borrow Christian morality as our world view.  We reject Christian morality with all its hypocrisy. To most atheist, Christian morality is an oxymoron. 

 The arrogant attitude that Christians hold themselves to concerning their monopoly on morality is laughable at best. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The common disputes are over land, wealth, and political control.  The use of religion as an excuse to justify horrific methods to obtain these ends is both ancient and contemporary and is always used to appeal to common people.  Rarely has a religion grown and thrived without the support of government.  This is why some American Christians are threated and lashing out against perceived prosecutions against them.  

Their dominance is quickly eroding and they know that the US Constitution does not support their former favored status.  Neither do our laws or legal agencies concerning discrimination.

  Demographics don't lie.  Religion in it's former state has a new wrapper and it's not supported by any political group as our founding fathers wanted it.  We are a diverse group.  If you want to belong here then you must give anyone from a religion different from yours complete rights to disagree but no right takes away what are basic human rights even if your religion disagrees.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I also think I'm lucky to have been born as an intelligent animal in a country and at a time when expressing my opinions won't be a death sentence! 
 
I believe that the average human commits hundreds of acts of kindness toward fellow humans, animals, and sometimes even the environment everyday.  We do this even if its not convenient, necessary,  beneficial to us or in extreme cases may endanger ourselves.  I believe this is the natural human condition and those that prey on others are in the small minority but cause the vast majority of unnecessary pain and suffering by choosing greed, be it power, fame, control or security because they lack a fundamental connection with humanity.  Sad. 

  To me suffering is a part of life just like death and both are part of the natural world.  What is considered cruel in nature is only a human construct.  Only humans inflict cruelty on each other when they don't need to.  I "think" my cat is being cruel by "playing" with an insect or mouse before he kills it but is he?  Maybe he is perfecting some hunting skill or making sure he won't get stung or bitten.

I know for sure I don't know for sure why my fellow Earthmates do what they do so I'll hold my human-centric judgment on my cat and dolphins for now.  Then again I doubt they give a shit! LOL          </TEXT>

<TEXT> You made my point and yours.  God's existence can't be proved by perfection.  There is no perfection in nature, only adaptation to available opportunities.  What we think of as cruel in nature when compared to human actions is begging the wrong question. If perfection existed then we wouldn't be having this discussion.

Humans might think the blue-footed boobie is "heartless" when she won't let won't own offspring back into the nest after it falls out or is pushed out by a sibling but I believe it's wrong to place human emotions or judgments on animals.  

I don't think the insect that lays her eggs in the abdomen of another species that in turn eats it way out of it's host is anymore evil then dolphins or hyena's that "rape" each other.  Rather than being pointless, it has lead to the survival of many species.  This doesn't mean human behavior follows suit since we have developed the capacity for long-term consequences.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't ignored you Furo Ergo Sum.  I've been involved with life's distractions otherwise known as reality.  Forgive me.

What I meant my your prejudices is the resistance by you to acknowledge the basic female or baseline development of many organisms.  

Not all animals reproduce sexually.  Some animals such as Aphids that normally reproduce sexually will reproduce asexually through the mother producing only daughters and will only produce males during certain citations.  I can think of no instance when a male organism has ever been able to reproduce asexually.  I'm not saying males are irrelevant in our species but they aren't the go-to sex biologically.

Whether or not you think Jost's experiments mean anything is irrelevant.  Science did and does appreciate his contribution to the understanding of embryology.  You have missed the point. 

I'll try one more time.

For people to get the traits encoded in their genes, the genes need to be turned on. You can think of a gene as a recipe. A recipe in a cookbook does you no good until you open the book, get the ingredients and follow the instructions

The same is true with our genes. In our analogy, the gene is the recipe and the cookbook is the chromosome (a large collection of recipes). The gene needs to be "read" by the cell in order for it to do what it should.  However, the gene may be misread or the chromosomes are faulty. 

By studying why chromosomes/genes act why they do, medical science hopes to understand other medical diseases.

When you add the influence of hormones to the genes it becomes really complicated.

<TEXT> Your assertion that male and female tissues develop in tandem and that only the external genitalia remains ambiguous is wrong (typical guy, only concerned on what's on the outside lol!).  

The Wolffian ducts develops 2 weeks before the Mullarian ducts.  Males will lose all remnants of the M ducts and females will eventually lose the W duct itself but not its undifferentiated gonad.  Those become the ovaries. Without the interference of testosterone and a antiMullarian hormone from the testis the fetus will continue on to develop as a female.  Males will develop their penis and scrotum from what would have become the clitoris and labia folds.

Perhaps during the course of your "studies" you will come across the work of Professor Alfred Jost, a French endocrinologist.  His experiments with rabbits proved that if you removed the undifferentiated gonads the animal will default (his words, not mine) to the female sex.  

After the holiday break go back to school and learn the difference between sex determination, sex differentiation and undifferentiated tissue.  Hopefully then all this will all make sense to you.  If not just ask your professor or better yet, spend hours contemplating your own nipples.  Happy New Year!   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, I'll play.  At conception, the zygote has sex chromes that are either XX(female) or XY(male). The mother's egg always gives X but the father's sperm determines the extra X or Y which determines the potential sex of the child.  Sometimes, as in the case with all sexual dimorphism, there will be anomalies such as males having XXY, XXYY or females with only X.  Most will present as males having female attributes due to the lack of the dominate influence of testosterone from the developing organs and the hormonal influence.  

Genes not only determine the sex but they play a part in determining when hormones turn of and on and subsequently how further developments happen.  It's not written in stone guys but it's incrementally important.  

Even the emotional state of the mother can influence production of hormones that can have an effect on her baby.

<TEXT> Infuriating isn't it.  I do have one correction for Paxalot.  Although female is the default mode until genes and hormones come into play, the zygote and subsequent fetus aren't really female or male but have the potential for both.  If you must rely on genes themselves it's telling that males are one chromosome off from females and not the other way around. Few die-hard misogynists will even acknowledge the science of embryology like some congress"men" from my state!  

The point though is even with our scientific understanding why do some people subscribe to an ancient mythology that reduces the importance of females and consequently subjugates them to males?    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pretty much most of my family was/is sociopathic, addicted or manipulative but I've mostly known this since I was a teenager.

That said, the only person in my inner circle that turned out to be really, really bad was my brother-in law.  

I first met him when I was pregnant in the mid nineties.  He had married a woman with a young daughter and she was pregnant with their child.  They had bought a house and seemed happy and normal.  A year later we stayed for a couple of nights with them during vacation.
Never saw anything out of the normal.  He maybe drank a little too much but nothing out of the ordinary for a southern redneck IYNWIM!

After some years they divorced as did I so I only followed my BIL through my ex and son.  Turns out he had a pretty serious drinking problem and eventually spent time in a state prison for a felony DUI where they took his DNA which is standard procedure.

Turns out his DNA turns up as a match for a murder that was nearly 20 old in another state.  The case was featured on TV for unsolved murders.  In short, a mother of two who worked as a dancer at a strip club was found murdered by her two young kids and the babysitter in her trailerhouse two years before I met him. 

An investigation followed and he confessed to her murder.  He's still awaiting trial.  

It still creeps me out that I stayed in the same house with a murderer with my newborn and that my kid grew up around him.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not particularly good at rap or poetry so I'll give you my best suggestion.  

You've made millions promoting a thug lifestyle that influenced countless impressionable kids to embrace morals that weren't exactly beneficial to them.  You then had kids of your own and changed your song.  Good for you.  Glad you realized the impression media has on youth.

IMHO, you should rap about being the Scrooge, what with the negative attitude toward the police and then make a video of you rapping about how the police can be your friend and school is cool.

You asked, just sayin'

Good speed to you and your campaign.   </TEXT>

  According to the Jews, the real Messiah was not to be the sacrificial lamb that leads to heaven.  The Jewish religion proscribes no heaven nor hell.  The messiah was to lead the Jews from persecution to a peaceful reign of the Jews over this world.  The big change from Judaism to Christianity and Muslim was this point.  Xtians and Muslims focus on a reward in an afterlife and Jews are about a reward in this life.

<TEXT> A better question is why are some Christians obsessed with Biblical literalism especially when it comes to forcing their own views down the throats of American public school children. 
  
  As an atheist, I don't have any problem with an American Indian believing that a tarantula created the earth or any of the other 4,000 or so Creation stories.  Why should I?  Everyone has an opinion and I, as a veteran, defended their ability to hold and cherish them whether right or wrong.

  What I and others have a problem with is when a faction of this country seeks to demand that their religion is supreme above all.  They declare that the majority of our forefathers were Christians so that means we are a Christian nation.  The fact that the majority were Christians doesn't mean their intentions were to make this country's government tied to Christianity in anyway shape or form.  Let me say this again,  The fact that the majority were Christians doesn't mean their intentions were to make this country's government tied to Christianity in anyway shape or form.

Get it?,  Got it?,  Good!

No one is trying to take away any of your rights! Believe what you want, we just don't want taxpayer's money paying for religious symbols for select Americans and unless you want the idea of an intelligent  God-tarantula being taught then let the public schools stick with strict math and science sans the ID stuff. 

Sorry but there's no geological evidence of any world-wide flood but it's not surprising that cultures all over the world can relate to a flood since they happen everywhere.  At least that's what my insurance agent told me lol. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I won't say that this film was misunderstood as the film didn't reflect the original story but the damage was done to the collective conscience of the viewing public and the original story was lost.  I refer to the original "Frankenstein".

The movie made the story out to be a cautionary tale about the evils and limits of scientific exploration, portraying the monster as a non-verbal, grunting, sub-human. The book, in fact, portrays the monster helping an unknowing family and learns how to communicate in French. Later, he gives a touching soliloquy to his maker that turned his back on him.  

The book was not a tale of science over-extending itself but a commentary of how a society can turn a person with potential empathy and intelligence into what they define is a monster.  The latter being much more scary and relevant to modern society!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Death is from sin nature"

The idea of original sin has been a sticking point for me since I was a child.  To conscientiously punish the progeny for a mistake their parents made is akin to justifying a caste system.  Your parents screwed up so I'm gonna make your existence while you're alive almost unbearable but if you praise me enough I'll reward you after I let you die which I don't have to do but because your parents disobeyed me, who didn't know any better because I never taught them what disobedience meant because I didn't want them to know any better. This made no sense to the naive 10 year old me then it does now.

My great-grandfather was a Baptist preacher. I was confirmed into the Episcopalian Church at age 10 and have been studying various religions including Christianity for the past 40 years.  Some things have become clear to me concerning Christianity.

A great deal of guilt is laid on Christian children just for being born. They are told that because of original sin sex is bad but necessary and even their future death is also because of sin.  All this adds up to atonements, offerings, sacrifices to the priests that can direct them to a way to escape death and live forever, (which as far as I know, no one has been able to do) and makes the priests, reverends, popes etc., rich while robbing the hopeful yet gullible. 
  
The sad thing is that while pinning their hopes on an "afterlife" they neglect and dismiss a precious opportunity of self-conscientiousness that is the rare occurrence of life. 

Instead of embracing and cherishing what they have, they claim that this fragile life on this fragile planet means nothing.

You talk about moral absolutes and call me a hypocrite but all I know is that I only have this life as a human on this planet and I will cherish and help future life here as long as it lasts.

Death is the rebirth of life and it's natural and OK!

<TEXT> It does and I can understand your dilemma.  I apologize for some of the conclusions I jumped to.

I had to pull some strings to get stationed where my parents were.  My 4'3" mother had to have a double hernia surgery from lifting my 6'2" step-dad after his heart surgery and stroke and they needed my help.  After I got there I found out that they owed the IRS $6500 or they would lose their house.  I took out a loan and paid the IRS. I stayed there for another year rent free to recoup the loan.  I thought about buying the house but because of foundation problems I decided not to. 

They eventually settled on a reverse mortgage which worked out well.

However, I did this with an income of around $43,000.  How you bought a $180,000 home on an income of only 18k at the time or even 25k makes anyone wonder. 

Good on ya and at least, even if it's an after thought, you are  taking care or advantage of your relatives. 

Good luck to you sir!

<TEXT> Once again, since you aren't legally responsible to pay the property and school tax for your parents, it doesn't count as your tax burden for the purpose of your argument.  When I agreed to pay my parents' property tax it was only to help them; the same as if I paid their electric bill, bought a new AC unit for their home, or even sent them on their dream vacation to Italy.  I still paid my own taxes and because it wasn't my home I couldn't write off or apply my VA disability discount on my federal returns. 

It's nice that you're "helping" your parents but it sounds like you are definitely receiving a benefit here because you're not paying rent.  Having lived in PA I know that $7612 a year would be considered pretty cheap rent for for renting a house that size.  Also it's interesting that you collect the rental income from a property you don't own and report that as personal income.  

Sounds like you have positioned yourself into a comfortable situation where you can live rent free on only 18k plus; supplementing your income by renting rooms in your parents house to other relatives.  

Good job! You still misrepresented yourself, have offered no argument about the ACA and have shown yourself to be a opportunistic moocher and family blood-sucker.  Did it ever occur to you that when they leave/or die it may not be yours?  Maybe so but from what I gather you've probably made sure the will is in order to your benefit.

This sounds like a clear -cut case of elder abuse to me!  </TEXT>

You make the declaration that your Christian god has given us absolute moral laws to abide by given your view. You say that this is a nation of freedom of religion as long as all other religions acknowledge that your religion is dominate and others must just suck it up.  

As far as I can read, the bible and it's new and old parts are as immoral as any book comes.  If you want to ban an obscene book from the public or school libraries it would be this book although I would never do that because I don't believe in banning books.

<TEXT> You define these Christians as hypocritical.  I do not.  A thorough reading of the Bible states that true believers are compelled to spread the gospel of Christ and make unbelievers understand the consequences of the choice they are given.  If they then choose to not follow the rules and commandments of Christianity then they shall burn in hell if the Christians don't do it first.  They've just replaced the actual burning with yelling taunts and insults. Everyone likes 
some encouragement!

The tired argument that Fundamental Christians are tolerant is laughable.  They are as intolerant as the most Fundamentalist Muslim radicals. 

A true follower of Christianity understands this and I respect their devout faith. It certainly rings truer than the milk-toasty pick and choose bible verses that fits whatever society you're in now deems moral for the majority of Christians of late. Talk about hypocritical! 

I'm saying that the true Christians aren't hypocritical or self-apologizing for their persecution of non-Christians. They truly believe that conversion is a matter of everlasting life.  Where I would rein them in is when it comes to mine or my children's rights to a neutral place to work or go to school. </TEXT>

"If in your world "Christians" are bullying non Christian people, then they aren't Christians at all."

In the real world, real Christians from many denominations have not only bullied but persecuted and many times murdered non-Christians or Christians from other sects all over the world.  Your No True Scotsman argument is quite false.

As far as your question about my own experience I would like to point out that I never said I was persecuted.  I said members of my family were bullied in school by Christians.  One example I can give you among many was the bullying my niece received at her school from her classmates when she "revealed" that her grandparents were Buddhist.  One would have thought by the reactions she received that she had said her grandparents were Satanist that practiced ritual baby killings.  The mean comments and ostracizing she got from the other kids were vicious and unrelenting even though she, herself was Christan  She would come home and cry uncontrollably because she couldn't defend herself or her grandparents at her age and none of her teachers ever tried stop the bullying.  This is the reason that these clubs, even in elementary schools are needed.  

It's not an agenda supposedly pushing atheism or even homosexuality.  It's about giving children of different backgrounds, different faiths or lack of, and sexual orientation a safe place to express themselves, vent, and connect with others of like mind.  The sad thing is many schools willfully oppose and actively try to prevent these non-traditional clubs from forming.

I pay about $1800 a year in property tax on a house appraised at $100,000. Assuming rates in PA are the same, you are living in a home valued at around $250,000 on a income of $25,000?

<TEXT> How are they using bulling as a weapon?  A weapon against what? The fact that Christians in the the USA have dominated and bullied other members of other religions for centuries and are now crying discrimination because they can't bully and discriminate? You should apologize! The only agenda I see from atheists is full inclusion into society and the protection of their children from hateful comments like, "you and your whole family is going to burn in Hell" from a 8 year old classmate.  

Whether or not you are aware of Christian religious bulling in schools it in fact happens and my family has has been in its cross-hairs.  If you think that atheist are only the bully maybe you're confused with the rights that adult atheists have tried to stand up for but, as far as the school yard persecution, that is alive and well and these clubs may help to keep these groups (non-christians and atheists) safe and maybe even excepted despite the bigotry and myopic views that are handed down to the unfortunate children of ignorant parents.  </TEXT>

I wanted him to be a freethinker and hoped he would come close to the same conclusions I've come to so I tried to teach him critical thinking skills assuming he would reach the "right" conclusion.  Was I ever thrown for a loop when he announced he was a Satanist on his Facebook page when he was 15!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well if we are to dive into the reasons gay marriage should be illegal under the Christian Flag then we should also consider the circumstances that would allow marriages to be legal under the same flag.  

First, polygamy.  Many of the Old Testament Prophets and Patriarchs had multiple wives, including Lamech, Abraham, Jacob, Esau, Gideon, Saul, David, Solomon, Rehoboam, Elkanah, Ashur, Abijah and Jehoiada. Some interpretations also suggest Moses had a second wife in Tharbis. Other polygamists identified in the Bible include Ahab, Ahasuerus, Ashur, Belshazzar, Benhadad, Caleb, Eliphaz, Ezra, Jehoiachin, Jehoram, Jerahmeel, Joash, Machir, Manasseh, Mered, Nahor, Simeon, and Zedekiah.

Second, the age of the bride was usually customary to be 12 years or even younger. 

Third, that rape victims were required to marry their rapist since their value as property was diminished. Deuteronomy 22:28-29.

Forth, slaves or prisoners of war were forced in marriage. Numbers 31:7-18 and Judges 21: 10-24.

Want to base US laws on what your myopic view of Christianity deems fitting as marriage then go right ahead and see how your Christian flag gets saluted!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Indulge me to allow the rephrasing of your statement:

 "The argument is that men and women differ and are not the same. You guys like to foment the idea that that is not true - that men and women are the same, have same capabilities, same responses, same reactions, and you are simply incorrect."

The argument is that blacks and whites differ and are not the same. You guys like to (sic)foment the idea that that is not true - that blacks and whites are the same, have same capabilities, same responses, same reactions, and you are simply incorrect.

Sounds a lot like an argument for the Jim Crow, separate but equal laws doesn't it?
 
Racism and sexism are both based on fear and the idea of superiority, dominance and submission.  The fact is the bible, from the beginning to the end, stresses the superiority of men over women. Whether one can prove Paul promoted this or not is irrelevant since the rest of the "good book" is quite clear.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> B. This one always got me.  Eve was deceived by a smooth talking serpent that claimed to know the mind of God and what would happen to them.  Since Eve didn't know right from wrong how could she make an ethical decision based on her experience. (If you've ever had young children you will know that telling them not to do something doesn't mean they understand that it's wrong or evil). Adam is influenced by Eve, who is, for all intent and purposes is a lessor creature and as naive as he is but he succumbs to, not a sly talking serpent, but a mere woman. Does he get the brunt of God's wrath for being gullible? No! Eve does! She has to bear children in pain for her "crime" alone. They both have to leave Eden but Adam had no specific punishment for his "crime".

Sorry, but just typing this out makes the story even more ridiculous!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> From my experience and that of my mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, great great grandmother etc., we all agree that all men and women came from a women body following the conception required from both sexes.  

The fact that the bible considers women an afterthought and not made in the same image or glory of god is the reason that half of the human population has been treated like sub-humans without the basic freedoms of thought, speech, movement or self-determination that the average man enjoys.  Paul clearly defines a woman's role as existing for the benefit of men. To me, it's not much different then Playboy's exploitation of women.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> As the overweight middle-aged woman that uses the scooters in the grocery store and gets the occasional funny looks from some people I don't even know, I say screw them.  This is what they don't know.  I'm a military veteran that is 90% disabled. I can walk short distances but prolonged standing or walking is excruciating. The steroids I'm given have significantly contributed to my size along with depression and PTSD. I resisted using a cart at shopping outings but my husband loves to shop and browse so I gave in.   

So to all the redditors out there that say I'm not a person, I'm gross, don't have any self-discipline, selfish because I took a cart from an old person, or whatever other vitriolic spew comes forth, I'll tell you to look in the mirror. How many of you have served your country and suffered from it?  To those that have served you know, but the majority of comments are from those that have no clue and to those I say you're welcome. Every time I get those looks or comments here I hold my head up high and wish everyone a peaceful good day!

Honestly, I really have no opinion on the subject, as I have never had a partner say "Eeew, I don't like you being cut, so we just aren't going to have sex." or vice versa.  I am not any happier or in any way saddened by being cut.  Hey, at the very bottom line, I'm a little grateful for being able to be lazy with hygiene (although I'm not) and get away with it.  Also: As I know no different, I can't say for sure that I'm as sexually "effective" as I would otherwise be, but I'm not impotent, and that's the (relatively, because I don't plan on having any kids any time soon) important part.

Oh, and I know a few people that are Jewish, and it's more about honoring Abraham than appeasing any kind of god. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unlike girls, that naturally "become" women based on their first menses, some cultures feel the need to provide a time in which boys "become" men based also on their ability to procreate since there is no specific event for males.  Menstruation and childbirth=pain and blood so, in some cultures, not surprisingly, they require boys to demonstrate their ability to withstand pain and/or survive an injury involving blood, although this can also coincide with an ability to provide for his family.  The example above does both and also puts the burden of birth control on the male!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I find your attitude about 12-step programs refreshing.  So many of those that have been helped by AA/NA, which are few compared to the number of people that have tried it, become almost cultish about 12-steps being the only program that works.

I'm an atheistic Buddhist so AA's principles were in conflict with the Buddhist principle that the power to change comes from within yourself and, of course the fact that I hold no belief in Gods.

There are several organizations that you can recommend. I used Rational Recovery but there is also S.O.S., Secular Organization for Sobriety and Women for Sobriety.  

WFS is particularly helpful because the challenges female alcoholics face are usually different then mens and some AA/NA groups can be predatory toward women that are in a vulnerable state i.e., the 13th step.  

Again thanks for having the insight to realize AA is not a one fits all fix.
Best wishes to you!

Several federal court opinions have found that compulsory participation in AA/NA is unconstitutional because of its religious nature.  Have you read the condescending chapter in the Big Book addressed to the Agnostic? It clearly says that a higher power is a reference to God.

<TEXT> I agree that actually making love with a woman is preferable to watching and jacking off to a porn video. I like to watch porn and sometimes with my SO *BUT*......
The problem is most porn makes a caricature of what actual sex is like so that people, especially if they are young with no experience, think that this is the norm when it's not.  Young women don't feel they measure up to the women they see  in the videos. Young men often feel inadequate compared to the videos. When this is their bench mark, and you have to include the performances of their favorite entertainers, they have no REAL REFERENCE POINT to gauge their real  sexuality and how to express it.  This has led to to so much sexual dysfunction among Americans that is could be be referred to as an epidemic.

Pat's worse than a moron. He's a charlatan that has bilked millions to pay for his extreme wealthy lifestyle. He's smart and savvy. A moron doesn't know better but Pat is the poster child of why religious entities such as church's like his needs to be audited by the IRS.

<TEXT> What a beautiful calli! We have one that's a stray. She drinks from our Koi pond and catches the mice so we feed her dry food. She got flack from our two cats but doesn't anymore.  Try this; make sure Sasha is there before you feed her. Give Sasha a Tablespoon of what you're feeding the stray (even if it's the same thing you feed your cat everyday, Sasha will go for it for territorial reasons).  It's a distraction and it reinforces a positive element to the visits from the stray.  Worked for us, they now touch noses through the glass door to our sunroom.

As far as the hole......bad idea!  You're inviting squirrels, coons, skunks and possums to make their home there. 

Good luck and best wishes! </TEXT>

This pisses me off. As a female with a 20 yr career in the Navy I can't count how many times some male corpsman blew off my symptoms this way.  If this story was true, which I doubt because a vine growing from a potato would not be able to grow outside the uterus/vagina and make its way to the spine, and she was in severe abdominal pain and the only thing he did was give her Motrin then send her on her way he would have been brought up on charges if it was found she was suffering from a real medical emergency condition.

<TEXT> Pepper, never ever concede that which you have no proof of. Ever.

You are correct that Perry and his cronies' only objective is to change the foundation of our state government to be based on Christian Biblical rules and laws including the education of our children. I base this on his ties to the Dominionist's organizations he has supported and their specific legislation. I also agree that educator's within my state abuse and flaunt established laws and the state doesn't come down hard enough when violations are discovered. 
There are, however, a few diligent rational folks in Texas that have managed, to some degree, to keep them in check.

If you know of a school district that has allowed creationism to be taught as fact you need to let me know where or at least contact the TBE. 

BTW: Regarding concessions, I'm not a teacher but thanks anyway.  I'm only a disabled Navy(cook) Veteran that has had an interest in Paleontology for the last 30 years.  </TEXT>

"In July 2011, the Texas Board of Education, which oversees the Texas Education Agency, did not approve anti-evolution instructional materials submitted by International Databases, LLC, while continuing to approve materials from mainstream publishers."

It might be helpful if you thoroughly read the entire contents of the links you provide.  That said, critical analysis of darwinian evolution could include the small debate between punctuated equilibrium vs uniform phyletic gradualism. The TEA does not require the teaching of creationism. Critical analysis is good to teach public school students. It also helps when reading articles on the internet.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Look at the Big Bang theory, please. Nothing exists, then everything does. Sounds like something that could be caused by an omnipotent deity if you ask me. Until that theory has been disproved, creationism hasn't either."

The problem with this logic is that the BBT and more importantly, Evolution can be disproved. That's what make it a scientific theory. This is referred to as the Popperian Princible. So far, Darwinian evolution hasn't been disproved and has, in fact, fit in quite nicely with other areas of scientific study such as geology, cosmology, and biology to name but a few.

Unlike Evolution, Creationism or ID can not be proved nor disproved because the supposed force(God) that created the universe operated supernaturally or outside the bounds of the physical world and since there is no way to test the "God did it" hypothesis it can not be regarded as a scientific theory.  

The question is not that creationism is false, maybe God really did plant fossilized dino feces to throw us off, it more that it's not science and shouldn't be taught as a competing scientific theory. </TEXT>

The Roman Empire, in expanding their empire, wanted to enjoin their conquered territories by allowing fully religious protocol of the future citizens to the citizen of Rome.  Bureaucracy being what is was and sadly what it is now, made citizens of conquered nations taxpayers but not enough to make a difference.

<TEXT> You make some pretty sound arguments for poverty before religion.  As a whole I would agree that Christianity in particular appeals to those that are poor. Several passages support the idea that rich folk can't go to heaven and the poor have a better chance of salvation.  Mother Theresa subscribed to this even though she, herself had the best healthcare money could buy.  

My view is that some religions make an individual"s circumstance concerning poverty or wealth an attribute or a hindrance. The Buddha came from wealth and gave everything away to understand why men suffer. But, unlike the Buddha who chose to teach how to achieve Nirvana in a lifetime, Christianity pushes believers toward death. That the only good thing to come out of a life of misery awaits after you're gone and some religions will say that if you tow the line, and accept your lot in life, your rewards in an afterlife are guaranteed. Sounds like a lot of bullcrap from ppl that are on top and want the majority of struggling ppl to stay complacent to me. </TEXT>

Since he didn't, was it his intention for Adam and Eve to have sex for pure pleasure since they would live forever? Maybe it was his back up plan just in case he had to punish them. If so, Eve still would have menstruated. Maybe he just added the whole reproduction thing like an after market add-on after the fall?  Either way, he could have designed the whole thing better so he owes me an apology in my opinion.

<TEXT> You've made a pretty good correlation between religion and poverty. What is the point you're trying to make if any? Are you implying poverty causes ppl to be religious or that wealth makes ppl less likely to be religious?  To get to a conclusion you must present an explanation or a "why" to explain causation.  Correlation does not equal causation. 

Texas, for example has many wealthy ppl who are also very religious.
Hypothetically, you may have a town with a high number of churches and also a high number of alcoholics.  Are there lots of churches because there are lots of drunks or is it the other way around (most likely the case in my opinion)  and if it is the latter then why?

<TEXT> Yes, ask Frankenstein.

Mary Shelly addressed this very question and the horror of the conclusion she came to sums up the relationship of a creator vs the created and the responsibility one has to the other. The evil the story of Frankenstein presents is how a creator can create life and, because of the creator's and society's rejection and lack of guidance and compassion, the creation became a monster when he didn't start out that way. Science is not the culprit but only the vehicle that allows Frankenstein to realize his real mistake/sin in turning his back on his creation out of fear and self-preservation. In this story he ultimately died for it.

<TEXT> Philosophically, if there is no beginning and no end then there can never be a "now" because it would take an eternity to depart or arrive at any single point. The symbol of a snake eating itself is illustrative of this concept of an impossibility albeit a primitive one. I believe that time as a force or natural law is real. The problem seems to be how time can exist within the concept of eternity. </TEXT>

So my husband and I brought her a slice of Oreo cheesecake and 2 chocolate covered strawberries on our next visit. She was so happy she gave both of us a big hug. I think she was happy, not for the cheesecake or the gesture, but that someone really listened to her. </TEXT>

The base Chaplain and I were friends and he knew I was an atheist. I pulled the Chaplain aside before service began and asked what I should do during the Eucharist. Before he answered me he asked why I was there. When I told him I had lost a bet he gave me a big grin and looked over at my friend, gave him a wink and told me to just cross my arms over my chest. He was the best Chaplain I've ever served with in my entire Navy career.  

PS: I'd never been to a Catholic mass before and I was surprised that they refer to Jesus as the "Son of Man" and not the "Son of God".   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was six when my parents divorced. I was sent to live with my Godparents who were also family. One night my Godmother took me and her kids to a pizza place for dinner which was a little unusual. After finishing my first slice of pizza I remarked to my cousin that my Godmother had already eaten three slices. I don't remember why I said this, maybe I just was commenting on how hungry she was or something but the next thing I knew she told me to sit there and eat the rest of all the pizza left, more than half of 2 large pies and took her kids and left to stay in the car. Not knowing why she was angry I started to stuff my face with pizza. After a while I realized I couldn't eat it all and I broke down crying. She sent my cousins back in to hurry me up but they could see I was upset and couldn't finish so they went back out to her car, told her I couldn't finish and then she came back in and boxed up all the pizza left over. We went home and she told me to sit at the dining room table and finish all the pizza. At this point I was scared and sick and didn't know what to do. I refused to eat anymore so she spanked(beat) me with a oak paddle in the shape of a hand that was 1/2" thick and then sent me to bed which I shared with my cousin who berated me for causing problems.  

Sort of tearing up just remembering this. I told my Mom many years afterwards and she could never eat pizza again. I've never told anyone else but it feels good to tell it here. ;) </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the Navy they teach leaders to praise in public and punish in private. Even Non-judicial Punishments are conducted in private except on very rare occasions. Not all "leaders" understand this concept. On my ship (DDG), the Leading Petty Officer, Leading Chief and Department Head Officer all stood by the motto of "Motivation by Humiliation".

During a 4-day underway a young Seaman Recruit was found out to be wearing bicycle shorts for underwear and he had only brought one pair. Not satisfied with a private verbal counseling and a written warning our pipsqueak of an LPO decided he had the authority to conduct a "mini-NJP" in front of everyone in his workcenter which also included females.

He had the SR put on his Dress Blues and deliver a speech about hygiene and the proper underwear that can be worn. The LPO instructed everyone beforehand to ask many questions in order to mock and humiliate him. The SR barely managed to make it through the ordeal without breaking down mainly because he knew some of us were disgusted with the LPO's gleeful delight in bullying and stomping on the dignity of someone he cared less about. His favorite thing to smugly hum was "Another One Bites the Dust".  </TEXT>

I knew an atheist Navy enlisted member whose rate was stagnant and couldn't be promoted. He decided to cross-rate to an RP because of the advancement opportunity and he was open-minded to members of all religious views or none and he eventually attained the rank of Chief. He neither judged or restricted any sailors requests nor their immediate family, and this is important, because often the family is as isolated as the service-member.     </TEXT>

<TEXT> In 1982/83, the uber-cool rich kids passed around a list of people that they thought might either want something (like an abortion/suicide) or whom they thought what might have happened to them in the past. I made it to the top ten. In a school that had a graduating class of over 2,500 it floored me that they even knew who I was, especially since I was in a work-study program and left at 1200 everyday for a part-time job. My parents moved 80 miles away and I wanted to finish school there.  

So "they", the honored and privileged students of Plano Senior High School decided that I was raped/molested by my own father and felt it necessary to divulge this "fact" to every other student at the school presumably, in an effort to help me according to their own Christian hypocrisy. This was false and my father passed away on the 8th of Dec, 1985 and none of the author's was there by my side.

2013, these same smug ares's sent me an invitation to a 30 year reunion provided I spend lots of money.

Although I would have loved to go and seen how the homecoming queen and king fared, I'm secure and happy that I've proudly served in the US military, am happily married and living in a beautiful house in Fort Worth, far, far away from Plano, Texas!

<TEXT> With the model that Christianity presents I would have to agree with you up to a point. He could have made robots out of the angels and humans but he didn't because he needed their choice to praise him and rejoice in his presence. 

Sounds like a lot of parents that want their kids to love and respect them and follow what they believe, religious and atheists alike. Doesn't always work out that way but all but the most rigid, fundamentalist parents will make their children suffer because they exercise free will. God included but He makes it forever.

God is described as omniscient, omnipotent, and omni-benevolent, a supernatural being that has existed forever and will exist forever. Sure beats my parents description. Why then does he/it require anything, especially something as mundane as worship, appreciation or sacrifice?

<TEXT> You obviously never served in the military but no matter. Service-members do not have to follow unlawful orders and, in fact, are required to report any incidence of violations of the UCMJ whether or not they were involved. Furthermore, if they participate in an unlawful order, they can be prosecuted under the UCMJ and civilian authorities. That's right! double jeopardy. Also, many, many decisions are made by junior personnel on their own, so far from being the drones you speak of, the military requires that they possess reasoning skills instead of the "paint it or salute it" response you believe the military wants.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great question! Most people think that a species is defined by its inability to interbreed. Close but not quite. Loosely, a species can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. In the case of closely related species or subspecies they can interbreed but the offspring are generally, but not always, infertile and are referred to as a F1 hybrid. Peppermint is the plant equivalent to a mule, zorses, and ligers. 

Biology is a hell of a study!   </TEXT>

<TITLE> My son suggested Avira but am having problems </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a Sony VAIO K series laptop that is running XP using linksys wifi router with an external linksys receiver.  My son cleaned up my hard-drives and installed Avira as virus protection but now my computer slows down and locks up on certain times. It seems to be in conjunction with Avira downloading files up to twice a day. 

Is Avira something that is causing the problem and/or are there better protections I can use. He volunteered this as a free but I don't mind paying for something better.     </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mine are my brother(45) and uncle(59) that haven't worked for over a decade except sporadically and are both felons. They lived with my mother until she died Dec 11 and because of her reverse mortgage have been able to con them into staying there over a year.  The property has now been sold and they're just squatting waiting for eviction.  All this while I was in the military and sending money home to help "mom".  Received 90% disability and husband and I bought our first home.  Now, in not so disguised pleas have asked to come live with us.  Hell no!!  I still feel bad for them though. What do you guys think?    </TEXT>

<TITLE> Church Tax....say Amen!!! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-02-28 03:58:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A local church has bought up property, 50+ homes that paid property taxes (5,000 a year avg each), in an old established neighborhood, to build a mega-church which pays zero taxes, with 5,000+ members.  Parking is at a premium so they want to nudge more "neighbors" to sell their homes to build more parking thereby lowering property values even more.  I don't mind a M-C building on undeveloped land but to reformat a neighborhood and essentially force people to sell who have lived there 30+ years doesn't seem Christlike nor neighborly.  
  My suggestion would be to eliminate the tax exception for M-C's like this because they use the existing infrastructure (roads and road improvements) and all other forms of taxpayer subsidized things like police and fire protection, public schools, libraries, weather alert systems, snow and ice removal, street lighting, storm drains, and even animal nuisance for free. These M-C's bring in a lot of money.
     They act in effect like a corporation with no rules. I think they need rules. I think the time has come to take a hard look at churches that are *wink wink* "non profit" and tax them! Reddit help!!!     </TEXT>

<TEXT> My uncle (57) and my younger brother (46) are soon to be homeless. They're both felons and haven't held a real job for the past decade. In addition they both have heavy drug use in their past. My uncle shows signs of his meth use even though he no longer uses. My brother has stolen from me and has never even filed a tax return. They've both lived with my grandmother and/or my mom from 2000 till they both passed. She had a reverse mortgage and they've been able to stay in the house for almost a year without paying a cent except utilities, ins. and taxes which are now due.

I was in the military until 2010 and for the past ten years sent money and gifts home to help Mom.

  I bought my first home after being rated 90% disabled. My husband and I are happy except that these "freeloaders" want us to subsidize them because "they're family".

  I won't jeopardize my own family, mental health or happiness to anyone that won't help themselves and they've had a year to figure out what to to but haven't. In one month they'll be on the street at Christmas time, no less. This depresses me to know end. The only thing I'm trying to help me out of this funk is Meals on Wheels. Wish me luck!

If anyone out there has had similar experience please share. I can't imagine it's not uncommon.
