<TEXT> I would argue that Palpatine is the main villain of the PT - he's not present as much as Vader is in terms of actively terrorizing our heroes, but he's the one pulling all the strings.

I think each of the TFA villains will mirror an OT one-

Hux - Tarkin
Phasma - Boba Fett
Kylo Ren - Vader
Smoke - The Emporer </TEXT>

<TEXT> Basically no indie movie has any chance of making money next year.

Star Wars, BvS, Civil War, X-Men, Suicide Squad, Independence Day, Finding Dory, Warcraft, Star Trek, Ice Age, Ghostbusters, Borne, Gambit, Doctor Strange, Fantastic Beasts, Assassin's Creed, and Star Wars again....

<TEXT> Affleck one his Oscar for Good Will Hunting, not The Town. 

Mad Max is just as much a risk as Furious 7 is. It's still a sequel, and it's an action movie. That appeals to a lot of people.

And nowadays the standard budget for most major studio films is somewhere around 100 million, and if the studio really didn't have confidence in those projects, they wouldn't have greenlit them. Only a few of those examples flopped, most were financial or critical successes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Suicide Squad takes place before BvS - Batman is in it, and the Joker is in it. In the latest BvS trailer, we see Robin's suit with presumably the Joker's handwriting on it. I doubt they'd take the time to tell this story in that movie, so it's more likely that they would wait for Suicide Squad - or possibly Affleck's solo Batman movie. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I definitely wouldn't call any of those projects risks particularly.

Nolan and Cuaron are critically acclaimed directors, Affleck is an Oscar winner, and the Wachowskis have made many successful projects in the past. 

Those are not risks. Most of those projects payed off, and it wasn't expected that they wouldn't.

It would be risky to throw 200 million dollars at a director who's only directed 1 feature film - and Universal are the ones that did that  with Jurassic World, not WB. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First of all, Plinkett elaborated as to why that shot didn't work in comparison to the opening shot of A New Hope.

Second, there's no way Roger Ebert gave TPM 4 and 1/2 stars because his rating only goes up to 4 - it was 3 and 1/2 stars.

And third - there was tons of effort put into the prequels by the actors and most of the crew, but George Lucas is not a good director. Watch the interview Ewan McGregor did on The Graham Norton show the other week, where he tells a story about how Lucas has a lot of trouble directing characters. He puts visuals above story a lot of the time, which leads to a bad movie.

I could very easily go out and make a crummy movie, and say that it's a homage to bad movies like Howard the Duck and Jaws 4, but that doesn't justify it being bad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think this is pretty realistic. Other than having Gwendolyn Christie and maybe Harrison Ford at SDCC, it's possible that they bring out Ewan McGregor at the end of the panel to announce an Obi-Wan movie. I think this would make up for the absence of a TFA trailer, and they could even show a teaser for the Kenobi movie, similar to what they did with Rogue One at Celebration. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah but I don't see any reason why Disney would put Star Wars in a place where studious usually go all out just to tell a couple of behind the scenes stories and some pictures. 

And besides, they don't want Star Wars to be overshadowed by DC if another BvS trailer comes out - they want to be the ones breaking the records for trailer views, not their competitors.  </TEXT>

They're trying to get a new generation into the Star Wars world, and if they want to do that, they must put story first, and not callbacks to earlier films that the audience might not understand. </TEXT>

The chocolate was originally wrapped on the outside, but they did it wrong, causing all of them to turn out like [this](http://imgur.com/Ek3DA3K)

Kasdan and Abrams are both competent writers, and I'm confident they know which direction to take the story in. 

We also have Kathleen Kennedy, who does her job of producer very well. We have an excellent cast, and I'm sure every other aspect of the movie is in very capable hands. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You know what I find particularly ridiculous? Is that incredibly small subs, some with as little as 30 members, are shutting down. They have very little, if not nothing to do with this. It's a problem that should be left to the people involved, and maybe the major default subs. Why should the people who don't know what's going on be permitted from enjoying content on subs they want to be on? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fuck you Rick Berman!

All jokes aside though, I just think there's this thing in movies today where movies with dark tones generally have darker colors. The Empire Strikes Back is the perfect example of having a dark movie, but still being able to have a vibrant color pallet. This kind of makes TDK look a little dull.

I get that they're good performances, but the character of Bruce Wayne has very little emotional depth. He's a shallow character, and his intentions can be very easily understood. Same goes for Alfred. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Watch some of the behind the scenes videos of the prequels. True effort is put into making them good movies. All of the cast and crew (minus Rick McCallum and George Lucas) are really trying their hardest to bring back the magic of Star Wars. Seriously, most of the CGI holds up well today, some genuinely good performances are given by McGregor and McDarmid, and there really are a lot of good scenes to be found. That's enough redemption for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There was nothing groundbreaking or special about Avatar other than the special effects, which are now commonplace in today's movies. I can't see any Avatar sequels making anywhere near the amount of money that the first one made.

However, Star Wars may be the most popular and successful movie franchise of all time. Like you said, its appeal spans multiple generations all across the globe, and a sequel 10 years in the making is not something that no one cares about. 88 *million* was the number of views that second trailer had in *24 hours*. That's amazing. There is no doubt in my mind that its success will be equal to that of Avatar's. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I honestly don't know how I feel. There were as many good moments for me as there were bad. Firstly, I loved the style overall. It had a very Disney-ish feel to it, which helped to bring a sense of wonder and adventure to it. On the other hand, it was probably one of the most cliche movies I've ever seen, and the dialogue was not anything to be proud of. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why The Dark Knight Doesn't Deserve To Have 9/10 On IMDb </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-27 02:35:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Now don't get me wrong. The Dark Knight is not, by any means, a bad movie. It is well acted, well directed, and very well put together. But as a superhero movie, and as a movie in general, it falls down in a few places.

1 We don't get emotionally involved with our characters. In movies like Superman or Spider-Man, our characters show that they are humans, and they have struggles. Superman literally moves the world back in time to save the person he loves. Spider-Man never knows whether he should reveal his true self to his friends and enemies. Batman just says he's the good guy. He doesn't show it, and you probably wouldn't care if he died.

2 Why so much violence? Seriously, why does every car or building need to get shot at or blown up? It should be a battle between the hero and the villain, not the hero and the villain and the rest of the world. It doesn't need to happen, and it shouldn't. Maybe a few times, but it shouldn't detract from the story itself.

TL,DR: - this is NOT a bad movie, but there are much better superhero films

<TITLE> Could The Godfather Part IV have worked? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-24 23:59:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Sometime before or after the release of The Godfather Part III, Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola came up with a potential sequel idea. It would have been a similar style to Part II, switching back and forth from Vito's early days as Don in the 1930s (as well as the early years of his children's lives), and Vincent as the new Don in the 1980s. Vincent takes a turn from his predecessors, and gets the Corleone family involved with narcotics again. It would have ended with his death. 

More info can be found [here](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Corleone), under "abandoned sequel"

Do you think this could've worked? </TEXT>

Some examples:

Thought that Star Wars was "too slow," Back to the Future is "cheesy" and Hitchcock is boring.

I need a 20th century movie that quickly gets into the plot, looks good, has a good pace, and good acting. His favorite movies are The Social Network and Nightcrawler.

<TEXT> An idea I had for the highest grossing movie of all time:

Director: Christopher Nolan 

Producer: James Cameron

Writers: Joss Whedon +                      
              Quentin Tarantino

Starring: Leonardo Di Caprio, Christian 
               Bale, Jennifer Lawrence, 
               Scarlett Johansson

Music: Hans Zimmer

Cinematography: Emmanuel Lubezki

Visual Effects: Weta Digital


What would you pick? Anything to add or change? 

EDIT: Spielberg as co director, also with Chris Pratt

EDIT 2: The plot is a cross between Interstellar, Inception, and Guardians of the Galaxy. Obviously. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Super Smash Brothers Drift (Kart Racing/Fighting game)

You would be able to play as all the characters from the most recent SSB game, with their own customizable racing karts.

The style of the game would be somewhat different than other racers like Mario Kart - you can choose to compete with 4 - 12 players on a variety of tracks. 

But here's the twist - there's no finish line - you are continually moving around the chosen track. The position of the players is determined by a damage meter/percentage, like that of the real SSB games. You can use a multitude of attacks on other players, including bumping into other karts, and launching projectiles. Items and power ups would be scattered around the track, and whomever has the least damage when the time limit is up wins the game.

This is just an idea I had and I would love to here your opinions. I'm working on some concept art for the game, which I'll post later. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Theory About Console Names </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-12 22:29:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is kind of a stupid theory, but I'll share it anyway:

As we all know, Nintendo's first few consoles were the NES, SNES, N64, and the Gamecube. Then, we had the Wii, followed by the Wii U. 

See any similarities yet? Well, it's a bit of a stretch, but both the NES and the Wii were succeeded by consoles that had the same name, with an extra letter added. This could be totally insignificant, but could the next console be the Nintendo 128 (or something along those lines) followed by the Nintendo Videosphere? Only time will tell...


TL;DR - theory about console naming
