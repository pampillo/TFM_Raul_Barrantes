<TEXT> I bought a Canon T1i years ago when I was low on funds and was looking for something with better options than a basic point and shoot.  Now I'm looking to get some quality lenses, specifically the Canon EF 70-200mm f/4L USM http://goo.gl/9IWHkE, but I'm not sure if my entry level DSLR is going to make the most of it.

Has anyone experienced something similar?  If I need to upgrade my camera, how should I go about it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> If reducing clearance is the goal, then you shouldn't be using single wall pipe.  Double wall stove pipe only requires 6" clearance, allowing you to put the stove as close to the wall as you want without requiring an additional shield.

OP's wall looks great, but most heat shields are a black piece of tin on the wall. Most installations look much nicer without a shield. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The woodstove they installed is UL certified with a specific clearance requirement.  As long as the minimum clearance is met, there is no need for an air gap to try and reduce clearance further.  Most modern stoves only have 4"-6" clearance requirements off the back and sides, making additional shields unnecessary. 

Shields are great for uncertified appliances that require 48" clearance to combustibles though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The trial was not about whether or not he killed Jun Lin, but whether or not he had the sense of mind to know what he was doing. Magnotta admitted to killing Jun Lin, but that his state of mind was so psychotic that he didn't know what he was doing was wrong. 

Multiple psychiatrists testified for the defense saying that they felt his schizophrenia was to blame. The obvious planning seemed to prove otherwise for the prosecution. 

I think this is the right decision and I'm very relieved that they jury came to it. Especially after a variety of fucked up decisions by Quebec juries recently.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a sales professional I disagree. My job Is to direct you towards the best product for you personally. That's the product that will give you the most happiness for a price you can afford. If sales is done properly, everyone wins. You leave happy with your purchase and I earn commission. People who inflate prices artificially or lie about the performance of a product hurt the rep sales professionals everywhere. 

I don't have to lie to you about a product. I just have to tell you that the one with the features you want is more expensive. You buy it or you don't. That's on you.

<TEXT> I'm late to the conversation, but this is worth mentioning. 

I was raised Catholic and went to church all my childhood, but after moving a couple of times I had pretty much stopped going to church by the time I became an adult and gradually lost a lot my beliefs over time.  Recently, my wife and I were planning to start attending church again since we now have a young daughter and we felt it was important that we raise her Catholic like we were. I went out and found a church for us.

At the new church I felt a connection with the deacon immediately. He was charismatic, energetic and "modern" for a church deacon.  He even baptized my daughter himself.  He was arrested on charges of distribution and PRODUCTION of child pornography mere months before she was enrolled in his Sunday school.

The thing that gets me the most is how comfortable I felt handing my child over that monster.  I'm done with the church now, not going back there or any other church. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Customer: Hi; how much is your paint?

Clerk: Well sir, that depends on a lot of things.

Customer: Can you give me an approximate price?

Clerk: Our lowest price is our introductory special at $12 a gallon; after that we have dozens of different prices up to $199.

Customer: What is the difference in the quality of the paint?

Clerk: Oh, there is really no difference; its all exactly the same stuff.

Customer: Well, in that case Ill take your $12 paint.

Clerk: Well actually the $12 variety is only available to you on our website. If you want to buy it here at the store youll be charged an additional $20 Customer Convenience Fee.

Customer: So if I go home and get if off the website its only $12?

Clerk: That is correct, Sir--- plus a Credit Card Usage Fee of $6 and then of course there is the standard Shipping and Handling Fee of $14.

Customer: What?!! So, in other words, buying online would cost me exactly the same as what Id have to pay here in the store?

Clerk: I suppose so, but if you buy it here you get to use it immediately. Online purchases take ten business days to get to you, unless you pay the optional $24 Express My Paint fee.

Customer: You have got to be kidding me?!! Arent you?

Clerk: Well no, Sir; but that is academic anyway as right now the $12 paint is completely sold out in both places.

Customer: Thats BS! I am looking at shelves full or the stuff!

Clerk: Ah, but that does not mean that it is available for sale. We sell only a certain number of introductory priced cans on any given day. Oops, look at that! It just became available again at $17.50.

Customer: Cmon! You mean to say it went up while Im standing here?

Clerk: Fraid so. Inventory control changes our prices all the time. I strong urge you to purchase your paint as soon as possible as it could go up again. How many gallons do you want?

Customer: Well, maybe three gallons. No, make that four; I dont want to run out. I assume I can return
anything I dont open?

Clerk: Certainly, Sir. The $12 paint is non-refundable, but if you return it within 48 hours you will be entitled to a $4 credit towards the future purchase of another gallon of the same colour paint at the same or higher price.

Customer: That is crazy! In that case Ill just give any unopened can to my brother as hes planning to repaint his home soon.

Clerk: Sorry, Sir, no-can-do! Our terms and CAN-ditions- -- thats a little in-house paint joke--- prohibit paint transfer. It is strictly for the use of the original purchaser.

Customer: But wait a minute; I hadnt spotted those Paint Sale-$9.99* a Can signs over there. That sound like a much better deal.

Clerk: Ah yes, thats from our low cost paint division. That asterisk denoted that the cans are actually half
gallons and the price is based on a minimum purchase of two. There is also an additional Environmental Fee of $5 per can; a non-refundable Can Deposit of $3.50; a Paint Facility Charge of $5 and if you want more than one color, the second has a $25 surcharge and the third is $5 extra.

Customer: This is ridiculous; to hell with it. Ill buy what I need elsewhere.

Clerk: Well sir, you may be able to buy paint for some rooms from another store but you wont be able to find the paint for your connecting hall and stairway anywhere but here. And I should point out to you that if you want Uni-Directional paint it is priced at $249 a gallon.

Customer: I thought your most expensive paint was $199?

Clerk: Sir, that is only if you paint non-stop all the way around the room and back to the point at which you started. Stairways and hallways are considered unidirectional one way exceptions to the rule.

Customer: So, if I buy the $199 point and use it in my hallways and stairs what are you going to do about itsend some goons in to paint over it?

Clerk: Sir, I believe you are getting it now. But no, please, that would be plain silly. Wed simply charge you a Direction Adjustment Fee plus the difference to the $249 on your next purchase.

Customer: New Purchase?!! No way! I am out of here.

Clerk: We at Skyhigh Paints never forget that you have a choice, so thanks for shopping with us and have a nice day. Bye bye!

And aint that just exactly how it is these days?

<TEXT> One of the first cars I ever drove was a 1973 Datsun 240z. I drove it from 2001-2004 since my dad thought it would be a good car to cut my teeth on, especially since you can open the hood and actually learn about how the thing works. Today's cars are basically computers under the hood.

I remember it felt like you were literally sitting on the ground it was so low.  It also used to get insanely hot in the cab because all of the heat from the engine had to go somewhere. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I travel for work constantly, I'm actually writing this in an airport. My best tip is to eliminate checked baggage. This won't help if you're going on vacation, but I can't tell you how many time this has saved me. 

Tight connect? Your luggage doesn't get left behind. 

Want to grab an earlier connecting flight? The first thing they'll ask is if you have checked luggage. 

If you eliminate checked luggage, you can literally walk off the plane and to your car or hop into a cab without breaking stride. 

This goes without saying, but the airline can't lose your luggage if its with you. 

Note:  Please use only approved size luggage for carry on travel. If I see you on a flight with your whole life in multiple suitcases, I'll recline my seat into your lap as far as it can go.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> People who board flights out of turn. When they call seating zone 3, if you're in zone 4, the agent at the counter should turn you away. But no one ever gets turned away! They just let them right on the plane like a reward for being bold enough to try or something. As a guy who travels for work, this drives me nuts.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not cancer, spiders or an abscessed tooth.  According to the dentist, the nerve on one of my molars died and then became infected.  So, the guy who said "blood and puss" is today's winner.  The only reason it ever got to this point is because I'm a Canadian that was traveling in the U.S. and couldn't see a dentist until I got home.  Thanks for your concern everyone, I'm on antibiotics and was even prescribed percocet for the pain so I'm high as a kite. </TEXT>
