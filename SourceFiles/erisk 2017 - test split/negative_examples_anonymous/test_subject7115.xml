Fucking crazy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hieeeee Ru! I just wanted to say that you are such a huge inspiration and I've been a die hard fan of Drag Race since season 2 when I stumbled upon it. I love all of your ideology and you've helped me learn to really love myself. I really feel it and I know I can do anything I set my mind to. I sometimes get down because I haven't found that one person I can really connect with and to give some of this love to. I'm young and I got time but I can't help feel like something is missing although I have all the pieces in front of me. How do I go about becoming more positive on my outlook towards a prospective partner or finding someone to share myself with? Don't get me wrong, I love my friends and family. What I crave is intimate connection. How do I get what I've desired for so long? Thanks for listening! Can't wait for the new season! </TEXT>

<TEXT> My parents have a Dauschund that whines and cries during car rides. Our other Dauschund loves car rides and she does too. It's just when we do long car rides over 45 minutes long that she gets anxiety. She's about 6 years old. I've been thinking maybe getting her an anxiety shirt (a thunder shirt I think is what it's called) and see if that would help her. Holding her in your lap sometimes isn't enough and she'll start whining again. I hope the comstant press use and sensation of being held will help her. </TEXT>

Maybe he won't block me just because of the way I look and we can continue having this awesome talk!" Or I don't send one because I'm too afraid and just want someone to talk to like you do. It never works out after I send a pic. I feel for you bro :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey everyone. I'm fairly new to playing the video games. I only ever watched the tv show and did the card game when I was younger. So I need advice on how to beat the elite four and the champ in this particular game. Here's the pokemon I currently have on me:

Cobalion lvl 67
Terrakion lvl 54
Magneton lvl 53
Unfezant lvl 51
Golduck lvl 48
Surperior lvl 44

Any advice helps. If I need to go and level up my pokemon more, then I'll do it. If you can give me a strategy so I don't have to do that, even better. Anything helps! Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Even if you could get decent prints off the blades, they would still have to be run off databases. It could've been done by someone who's never had their prints taken, like dumb teenagers. The Intergrated Automated Fringerprint Identification System [(IAFIS)](http://m.fbi.gov/#http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/fingerprints_biometrics/iafis/iafis)  has millions of fingerprints in its database which includes criminals, civilians, and suspected/known terrorists. Even if the comparison was narrowed down to the local level, they have a large possibility of not getting caught. But do I hope these sick fucks get what's coming to them? Absolutely. </TEXT>

I think it was the next day or so, I took a risk and asked him to dinner (which was super uncomfortable for me since I had never actually asked someone out due to the lack of opportunity). It never happened. Not because he said no, but because after I asked him out he stopped talking to me. We were having a great time talking to each other, but I guess he couldn't handle talking to someone face to face. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember this place as well. I used to talk to a lot of people and it made me feel better. I had a guy that I really liked and he liked me as well and so it was an internet relationship of sorts. Then his mom found out about him and one day I get a call from his phone number, but it was his mom and she accused me of poisoning her son and never to contact him again or she'll call the police. I was 15 at the time and just the threat of police scared me so much. I felt bad for him and also myself because it was the first guy I actually had a connection with. I often wonder how he's doing and if he ever ended up ok. There were other significant people I met but that one has always stayed with me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bear with me, I swear it's all relevant.

I'm a 20 year old gay man who is currently living at home, with a very non existent social life. I've never been in a serious committed relationship where I called him my boyfriend. It's always been strictly physical and I just always went along with it, anything to hopefully have a relationship. I know how that sounds and it took me a whole to realize how ridiculous it is. A guy I was seeing last year (let's call him Bill) ended things after 8 months. During the entire time I thought I was going to get committment from him but it ended on heartbreak. I blame myself for anything I did to make him not want me.

Fast forward and we're good friends. I forgave him, and after a nice break from him I got over my feelings for him. He started seeing this girl and I was fine with everything. He said he wasn't into going full on with a guy. This past Sunday he says things didn't work with this girl. It was too bad because he liked this girl. Later on he shows me a letter and says it's to his "boyfriend." My heart actually sunk and I snapped. I went off. He said they'd been seeing each other for two months and then he asked him to be his boyfriend. I was shocked. Literally. He's free to do what he wants, it's just the only that bothered me was that he was so quick to commit to this guy he met two months ago. I spent 8 whole months working on him, trying to get him to commit, and it takes this guy two months.

I went off. I cried in anger, I was sobbing uncontrollably for four hours. What did this new guy do that I didn't? Is it me? After Bill, I searched for someone to make me feel whole, loved and like I wasn't hopeless. I had met this guys in September who I though was going to be the guy to commit and after two months he just stopped talking to me.

I think I have depression and I might be bipolar (all of which hasn't been diagnosed because of how afraid I am to see someone). I've never felt lower. I just get rejected and then Bill commits making me plunge. I almost did something drastic to myself. Despite all the desire to end it, I stomached my pain and reached out to my dad. I didn't tell him about being gay, but I told him I needed help. But he tells me that maybe I should "pray more" because "God will fix it" and that I need to "rid [myself] of the Devil."

I finally got the courage to reach out, and it feels like it was made into a joke. I don't consider myself religious. I'm spiritual but I don't believe in God (if that makes sense). I prayed to him since I was 12 to make the desires for other boys go away, and since I was 15 to make my suicidal thoughts go away and to make me not so sad all the time. People say he works in mysterious ways, but making me and others like me suffer so much is plain cruel. 

Despite my dad being an ass, after the holidays, I'm going to make an appointment with my doctor and take the steps nescessary to beat these feelings. Telling him gave me the strength. I just needed somewhere to say all this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never said my theory was right, that's exactly why I said theory. It's my opinion and what I would think would happen in a practical situation. So excuse me Mr. Expert. But dogs CAN deliver false positives in ANY situation. Just because they're cadaver dogs doesn't make them extra special and excuse them from that probability.

<TEXT> They still can deliver a false positive. I theorize that the cadaver dog would not be able to detect any further smells after they expose the dead animal because his nose would be overwhelmed.

<TEXT> I'm confident my sadness or depression stems from me being gay and having to repress it all these years. I haven't told my parents because I know how strongly they feel about homosexuality and I don't want to lose my parents over it. I know that this sort of thing only happens in extremes cases but I would consider it that due to how my parents speak about it. Whenever they have to share their thoughts on how wrong and disgusting they think all gay people are, I do get some comfort from my brother who knows. I want to tell them about the depression and my sexuality but I don't want to be hurt from the very people who are supposed to love and support me unconditionally. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My cousin committed suicide a few weeks ago </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-12-14 18:21:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> She jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge. She was 41, I believe. I never knew her that well. I only met her once in my life back when I was in elementary school. My cousin had been diagnosed with depression some time ago and had been battling it intensely with therapy and medication. I was told by other family members closer to her that she even considered doing some form of voluntary electroshock therapy to cope with the feelings and make them go away. 

I myself have been struggling with sadness and horrible self-esteem issues. I myself have never been to a therapist because I'm too afraid of what my parents might think or say, or if they ask the reasons why I want professional help.

When you hear about someone's death, you're supposed to feel remorse, sorrow, sadness. Typically this is me too, but it was different this time because it struck a chord with me. It angered me. I became jealous of my cousin. She escaped her hell. I'm still in mine because I don't have the guts to off myself or get help. Does it make me a monster for not feeling sympathy? For being heartless? To be selfish in this way?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's hard to get out of here. I was going to college last year, moved three hours away from home. I was really close to my boyfriend at the time with him only being less than an hour away at a different school.

I went to reapply for this past semester of school and had some issues with my loan and financial aid which forced me to stay this semester. I'm trying to become a forensic entomologist and my small junior college doesn't really handle people in that field which is why I'm trying to get into a major university (Shooting for A M). I found out last week that it's probably not going to happen because the advisors at my school got me into the wrong classes and I have to stay under a minimum 45 cumulative hours in order to get into the department at A M. They literally told me to forget my degree. So that has only brought me down even more.

My mother also broke her arm this past July so it was fortunate I stayed home. I got to take care of her because my father has a job five hours away so he's only home on the weekends. I'm stuck right now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello everyone. I am 20 years old, overweight, and gay. Every time I meet someone and things go well, they end up rejecting me or saying they shouldn't be dating right now. I've only had one actual boyfriend. My friends all know that I'm gay, as well as my siblings. My parents are the people I'm working on. Please don't tell me they already know, that's not what I want to hear since I hear it so often from my friends and dates. For everyone else, it's not their business unless I want it to be. I don't care if someone else tells them, but I won't if I don't want to. To get to the point, I go on dates, talk to various guys, meet wonderful men, but can't get someone to take me as theirs. This is what makes me so down and low. Especially right now. I had been seeing this guy for 2 months, and things were so good. I couldn't believe I was able to find someone like him. Then things took a bad turn when I thought to bring up the conversation asking where this was going. Needless to say, I've been rejected. To make matters worse, my bisexual ex, who I have become very good friends with, has met a girl he really likes. He talked about moving to where she was, marrying her in the next few years. I would be fine if I wasn't so jealous that he's doing better than me. I've been to my lowest before, where I twice tried to kill myself. I'm scared about going back down. Every time I meet a great guy, it turns out to be nothing. I'm so tired of being tossed about. I'm so sad and alone, I don't know what to do. All I ever wanted was a companion to be with. I was alone growing up gay in a small rural Texas town, and as an adult, I'm lonelier than ever. I can't stop crying. I just want my pain to stop. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My nana is very content at the nursing she's at. As she's said to me many times, "I got nothing to squawk at." She turned 91 recently and has been in the worst stages of Alzheimer's for the past couple of years. When we went to go see her for her birthday, she called my mother (her daughter) by name instantly. I could've cried. She hasn't known my mothers name in two years. Sometimes it all comes back to her, other days she's lost but happy. All she does is smile. I always bring her chocolates because they're her favorite. She doesn't know who I am but she knows she trusts me and when I look into her eyes it almost as if she's remembering me, but then the moment passes and she goes back to the chocolates. I don't think about her forgetting who we are. I think about if she's happy or not. I always ask, and the answer is always "Definitely." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've all about given up even bothering to date anymore due to my fear of rejection. I personally haven't ever handled it well, and lately being as lonely as I am, I honestly am not sure what would happen if I got rejected, no matter how politely they said it. Yeah someday I could get a yes, but I'm too afraid. For you rejection might be easy. It's not for me. Not by a long shot. Being gay, I could just wait for someone to ask me, but I've had no offers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My sister, her boyfriend, and I are all struggling with quitting. It's just so satisfying. I started smoking socially while I was drinking, and it evolved to a point where I used to smoke a pack a day. I'm 20!  I usually smoke now when I'm bored. I was so close to quitting last year. It would take a week to two weeks for me to finish a pack. Plus, being a broke college kid and not being able to afford them helped. I'm looking into some alternatives. If anyone had any suggestions, things that have worked for you, I'd be glad to hear some.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> About two months ago I met up with this guy, hit it off, went back to his place to get it on. We started making out and we were having a good time. Then I noticed there wasn't much to grab a hold of while I was exploring. I figured it was just because of the way his dick might've been positioned. I went to go down and unzipped, pulled it out and just looked. This guy had a 2 1/2 to 3 inch dick. I am not joking at all. I wish I was because this guy was really cute. I'm a bottom and so there was no way I thought it would do the job. I didn't say anything, I just blew him, let him finish, pretended to look at my phone and was all "oh shit, I have to go! There's an emergency with a friend of mine!" Didn't see him again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I live in Texas, which is home to two "Body Farms", belonging to Texas State University at San Marcos, and Sam Houston State University in Huntsville. I'm actually studying to become a forensic entomologist! I am so jealous (as bad as that sounds) that Stephen Fry got to visit one! In Texas, the "Body Farms" are very hard to get in to. They are very strict as to who is allowed in. I heard from a professor of mine that you even need express WRITTEN permission from the Dean, various department heads, etc. My professor has been trying to get into one of them for years with no success, even though she has her PhD in entomology. They had a problem a few years back with students taking cameras, phone, anything that takes photos, into the farm. The bodies are all donated and so the privacy and dignity of the decedent have to be protected, so when that was violated, they tightened the reigns. I'll hopefully be able to get in good words with a few people and maybe one day get in myself! Fingers crossed. If I can't get in, I can always wait until after I die. I plan on donating my body for research to one of these farms. Still, these farms are not just cool for a person like me, they help investigators and researchers out a lot.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you find a wound on the animal, there's a good chance that flies laid eggs in the wound. The main concern is that they can carry disease into the animal, making it sicker. In some cases the maggots actually help, eating the dead tissues (which is what they do) and clean up the wound. Doctors do it to humans, but they of course have access to sterile maggots. Still have the animal checked for infections and such.
Another theory is that it's bot fly larvae which burrow into the skin and incubate until they are ready to fall out and turn into adults. If you find small holes in the skin at central points (spaced/grouped fairly close together) could be bot flies. Have your animal checked just in case though. Hope this helped. </TEXT>

Grandparents are supposed to be those guys to spoil but even they should know when to stop so maybe just talk to your parents and/or in-laws about it. Packing him a healthy lunch for school might be something too. It's ok to indulge every now and again on sweets and junk but teach him that if that's all he eat, it's a very difficult road filled with many serious health complications. I know it's like I'm giving you a lecture but its all in best interest. Wish someone would've done it for me. Keep it up and best of luck! </TEXT>

Jinkx can display glamour when asked, she's funny, she can really act and sing and for me that's the total package and what a superstar is. Alaska is almost in the same boat only because she can't sing. I like Alaska's style more than Jinkx's. Roxxxy is just all beauty and no substance IMO. Jinkx and Alaska are entertainers in all respects of the word, whereas Roxxxy is look. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You should watch her on Willam's Beatdown on YouTube if you haven't already watched some of the episodes before. I look forward to Drag Race on Mondays, but then I yearn for the Beatdown on Fridays! She also does makeovers on a show on the same channel (The Stylish) called Transfashionable. Courtney Act is also on Transfashionable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No. He got caught somewhere under my house and we couldn't get to him. We would let him play outside (as long as someone was always with him) and my dad was outside with him, left him out, went to find him and he went under the house. We had no way of getting him out. We died under my house. I was 11 and cried for three days. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually, I would say the same top three! I know Detox will definitely get in there. I like Ivy and I do agree, I hate the way they say her name. I liked Coco at first. Then she let Alyssa being there get to her so badly and now all she does is play the victim. Alyssa has gotten over it (except for having little digs at Coco every now and then, which is understandable to me being in the competition setting. People are going to try and put you down.) I would like Coco even better if she didn't have that attitude. Roxxxy is all body and face. No substance in my own opinion. But as far as top three, Detox, Alyssa and Alaska are the best predicted for it. I would want either Detox or Alaska to win though. But, if Alyssa gets that $100,000 maybe she could fix that overbite! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think these top 7 all have something they're talented at. Obviously for Jinx and Alaksa it's comedy, Alyssa is a dancer, and they all display it well. Even though I'm disappointed with what she's done so far, Detox is really talented. She is a great performer in her own right, but I know she can do better than what she's given us on the show. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You really haven't seen much of her work outside of the show, have you? She's brilliant and every bit as talented as Sharon. Yes she and Sharon do the same style of drag and they think a lot alike, but that is a bullshit answer as to why she got onto the show. I don't disagree that Sharon had some doing with it, but nevertheless Alaska is earning her keep. She needs to change it up like Michelle said this past week and that she's getting predictable. They said the same thing about Sharon. Sharon is all about spook, Alaska does more "glam". They're both unconventional. Alaska is doing a great job. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a picture of the site where JFK was assassinated. They made a movie starting Kevin Cotner exploiting the conspiracy theory of there being a second gunman who delivered the fatal head shot.

<TEXT> Dealing with religious friends is tricky. If they love and care for you, the fact you're gay shouldn't be a big deal to them. You're still the same person, you just decided to share an aspect of your personality and life with them you hold value to. If they have issues with it because of their religious beliefs, they should have enough sense to look past it. If they don't, I wouldn't say they really cared for you. But don't take it offensively. They're missing out on amazing opportunity to know someone who is courageous, strong and just brilliant. I've had really religious friends who have beliefs against homosexuality look past it because of the relationship we have and for who I am. Hang in there. I never really believed it when people said it gets better, but now I can say that it gets unbelievably better. I became so much closer to my friends and my life is looking up. I was so low. I have nothing to look forward to but the top of the hill. I hope this helps. Good luck and love yourself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Johnson's lived 30 miles away from where I grew up. President Johnson was long dead before I was born, but Lady Bird died almost 10 years back, I think back in 2004 (can't really remember). I lived in Fredericksburg, and the Johnson's in Johnson City. They attended church in Fredericksburg at St. Barnabas Episcopal Church. Lady Bird was such a nice woman. One time when I was 3 years old, we were late for church. We sat in the back row, behind Lady Bird. I was being unruly, not behaving. Mrs. Johnson turned around and told my mother what a cute child I was and asked if it would be alright if I sat with her. Needless to say, I was quiet the rest of the service. She loved kids. I bet she really was laying into her husband. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While it may be a gimmick, she really does have enormous talent. She's just gone off the deep end, let the fame get to her head (I think at least). I'm a huge Gaga fan but you have to admit it when the people you idolize and respect lose it. I saw her in concert in 2010. She really is an amazing vocalist and her piano skills are incredible. She just needs to calm it down. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see where you get that and I respect that being her fan. The great thing about music is that a song that can be so small and insignificant can mean so much to someone. A lot of Adele's music speaks to me on a personal level. The music helped with a lot of heartbreak. But, music is fascinating. Songs become personal, and that's the beauty. Some people enjoy it for the tune, the rhythm, the vocals, or the words, and its all about taste. Like wine. You pick and choose until you find something you like. That's how I see it all.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was nice most of the time. We'd get into little fights but we got over them quickly and everything was good. And being big and not getting guys that often, I have to go for guys that fetishize fat guys. Sometimes it gets creepy. I don't want someone who wants me because I'm a big guy and that's what they like, all those people do enable guys like me to get bigger. I'm trying to shrink, not grow. I want someone who is going to support me in weight loss. I would talk to my ex about it and I asked what would you do if I lost weight and it was a considerable an he literally said he wouldn't be with me anymore. I need to get away from the fetish. But sadly, it probably won't happen. I have to get skinnier before I can find that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's hard to seperate things because a lot of things I do on a daily basis or some of my mannerisms remind me of him a lot. Things I say, thing I think of just scream out and it just gets me down. My self esteem has always been an issue for me because I'm a fat guy, and I'm trying to change that. It's hard work but I'm trying. He brought me up and then when he said he didn't love me anymore and broke up with me over the phone, it destroyed my confidence. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got dumped a couple of weeks ago for the first time after 8 months with my first ever boyfriend. I had never been in a relationship with anyone before, nor had I done things with a guy so he was my first everything. I even ended up giving him my virginity because I thought I was ready. I don't regret it. But I just still have a lot of emotion towards the breakup and keep trying to tell myself I'm past it but it really hurt my self esteem. I'm a bigger guy and so it was hard finding my first relationship and took a lot of time and hard work. I'm 19 and I just can't figure out how to get past it and rebuild myself. All my confidence is gone and I don't know many other gay guys to ask. Please be nice. Thanks. </TEXT>
