<TEXT> A while ago friend of mine got scammed out of his unusual and I managed to get the scammer marked on pretty much every trade site, my friend got some compensation from a couple guys who heard about it. He showed me the items he got back and it added up to around $85, considering that he got scammed out of a $50 unusual he was pretty happy.  
  
Those items now reside in my backpack because I bought his backpack but they live on through me I guess. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Scouts are very annoying, but you need to remember that they tend to earn the kills they get by shooting you and then talking whatever shit they want, they did outskill you to get the kill, maybe they got lucky but when you compare that to a Spy with 300 ping running around going "trickstabed noob" after a facestab a Scout seems like a blessing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I mean I guess, but the Huntsman goes faster than Sonic the Hedgehog in the green hill zone with a hitbox bigger than... Something big. The hitbox for the Huntsman is big enough to score headshots without aiming much and does 360 damage from a second of drawing the arrow compared to 150 from a Quickscoped Headshot.

<TEXT> I know, that's why it looks bad, but just saying it's bad and therefore ugly is like saying "I enjoyed this movie" is the same as "10/10". There's no reasoning behind why you enjoyed and rated the movie so highly.  
  
I could have just said 'It looks bad and is ugly" but that's not explaining *why* it looks bad.  
  
Ugliness isn't just looking bad, it's *living* bad.   
[My friend Spongebob said it best.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N0yXGVWS1Y)  
  
If something wants to be bad it needs to be open for criticism, just look at that movie Quarantine, it's an awful version of something good, just like the Bazooka vs The Stocket Launcher, I'm not going to go any deeper into this but basically America took the movie [REC] and made it ugly, an American took the Stock RL and made it ugly.  
  
The [duct tape] (http://i.imgur.com/boQuHqI.png) is still awful so I'm glad it gets held behind me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Beggar's Bazooka not only looks like shit but takes a shit on players. This horrendous pile of trash has dropped too many ubers while looking worse than ramen noodles thrown onto bread with butter. (But for real noodles in bread is SO good but looks awful.)  
  
[Look at this thing.] (http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/777183914644516158/36652D6B073BF227551DFA753D64AE7262DDF5EB/) What is the appeal for the design? "Yo guys have you ever wanted to take the normal rocket launcher, and throw garbage all over it!? Well for only $2.49 USD this can be all yours!"   
  
Let me break down this item for you.  
Starting at the back we have [this] (http://i.imgur.com/LJQLuer.png), it's the missing piece of the [Stainless Pot!] (http://tf2wiki.net/ww/images/thumb/b/ba/Soldiertinpan.png/200px-Soldiertinpan.png)   
And then that Pot Lid is DUCT TAPED ONTO THE ROCKET LAUNCHER.  
  
Now we can move past the only thing keeping it on, without the duct tape I'm sure it would fall apart. Wait no don't worry guys, [there's a belt.] (http://i.imgur.com/nwCW9BS.png) Just in case your pants fell off mid fight.  
  
I can only assume that [this is for aiming] (http://i.imgur.com/TWEV0cY.png) good luck putting this into use when it spreads like butter on ramen noodle bread (Really guys, try it, it's great.)  
  
[What's this for?] (http://i.imgur.com/otT3vlf.png)  
  
[This handle] (http://i.imgur.com/Q4MVHx3.png) is held on by [cable ties] (http://www.samuelgrant.co.uk/productsbig/135.jpg)  
  
You didn't think that the Stainless Pot was the only hat here did you? This isn't just any [handle] (http://i.imgur.com/ac39anE.png), this is the [Handyman's Handle!] (http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/thumb/a/a4/Handyman's_Handle.png/250px-Handyman's_Handle.png?t=20111210080558)  
  
[Why is this here? Incase the rockets get jammed?] (http://i.imgur.com/W0wooyy.png)  
  
[No idea what this is but it's dumb] (http://i.imgur.com/vNJy0p7.png)  
  
So in summation, it looks bad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe in 2010 it was 25 on hit, but before this nerf/buff, it was 15.  
  
And as for healing 45 per shot, just grab a Medic buddy and the Blackbox was always a downgrade, it was never that strong to begin with if you could put a few seconds into thinking about killing him. </TEXT>

<TITLE> What item has been crafted the most times? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-11 16:34:23 </DATE>

<TEXT> Title. Every item that can be crafted (To my knowledge at least) gets a craft number, only 100 of them can be seen ingame, but like [these canteens] (http://i.imgur.com/atD8a3y.png) they have a number visible on backpack.tf, so that got me thinking, what item has the highest crafted number?  
  
I'm sure that metal would be the highest if it had a number, but come on now, let's not be bitches about this, let's talk about cooler items.  
  
Personally I think that the item most people need to craft at a point is the MvM Upgrade Canteen.  
  
What are your thoughts? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This one time I ended up doing something that made me feel dumber than dirt.  
  
I was playing some Team Fortress 2 in a public game and somebody was sitting in the spawn not moving.  
I think nothing of it and go out to fight the good fight.  
After about 10 minutes of playing I hear a voice say "Mmph, shorwy I waws ghetting foowd."  
Clearly the guy had food in his mouth and didn't know to chew with his mouth closed.  
From what I can tell he was probably autistic or something because he talked in all the Heavy's lines.  
I play Medic alot so I ended up healing him.  
He always called me "DOCTOR" because that's what I was for him, I was his Doctor.  
In TF2 there's a mechanic called "Ubercharge" which you can google to learn about, not gonna explain it for you.  
The kid yells "DOCTOR, CHARGE ME WHEN BABY TEAM IS NEARBY! HIT IT DOCTOR, CHARGE ME!"  
I pop the uber and he wipes out the whole enemy team.  
He adds me and I accept.  
Every time we play together I go Medic and he goes Heavy.  
He always yells Heavy's battle cry or laughs like him all the time.  
Always thanks me, "YOU ARE GREAT DOCTOR!"  
I think he was poor because he never played any games other than TF2.  
Whenever I asked him about it he said "Doctor, money is needed, must collect money, but money is hard now."  
He sounded so sad so I asked him if he ever saw [Meet the Medic] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36lSzUMBJnc) to brighten up the mood.  
When he said no I gave him a link to the video.  
He was very ecstatic and eagerly asking about the part where the Medic put the uber part into the heart.  
He asked if it was possible to get a new heart with uber.  
I said heart transplants are possible, but without uber.  
He got sad again.  
"Maybe in the future."  
He then gave a Heavy laugh and said "THEN DOCTOR, HEAVY WILL WAIT FOR FUTURE."  
  
A few weeks pass.  
  
He messaged me saying "DOCTOR, Heavy will not be fighting until later in the night."  
It wasn't until tomorrow until he got on.  
For the record he called himself Heavy because that's the only class he ever played and it was his Steam name.  
  
I got a message saying "DOCTOR, Heavy doesn't feel well. I go to other doctors but they were nowhere near as good as you, DOCTOR."  
He sent this message when I was already asleep, I have no fucking idea where he lives.  
Last message said "DOCTOR, Heavy will go now. But do not fear baby men on other team. You are good doctor. With you, victory is always good. Heavy will join in future.  
By the time I got the message he was already offline.  
He never came back on in a year.  
One day he came back on, I messaged him and asked why he'd been away the whole time.  
It was his mom.  
"David, (Heavy), died of heart failure, I'm sorry. Are you the doctor he was always talking about? You're the only friend on his friends list. He was always going on about how him and the Doctor were best friends and how you always lead the team to victory. I don't know what he was talking about, but I was happy that he was happy. We're selling this computer because we never had much money to begin with, if we did he would be here right now."  
I sat there and looked at the screen for a good 5 minutes before another message popped up.  
"Before I sell this computer, I have one question I need to ask."  
I replied with "Please go ahead."  
"I need something."  
"What is it?"  
"I need about tree fiddy."  
  
Now it was around this time that I realized Heavy was 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the paleozoic era. Goddamnit! That Loch Ness Monster had gotten me again! "I ain't givin' you no tree fiddy you god damn loch ness monstah!"  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The saddest thing I've ever seen was when my son stole my money and basically changed my whole perspective of him. Reader beware, you're in for a tear.  
  
It wasn't too long ago. I was doing some work around the house, and he came and asked "Dad, can I ask you a question?" so I said, "As long as you didn't get someone pregnant, go ahead."
He asked me if he could borrow $50 and I said "If you're just gonna spend it on booze you can go work for it."  
He just stared at me, looking real sad, then he went back inside. I started to contemplate if he actually needed something or if I was right about it just being beer money. I decided to trust him with the money and hope he wouldn't come back home reeking of liquor.  
About 4 hours later he came back looking incredibly proud of himself, he told me that he spent the money on a new suit to be made for him so he could get a job.
I was extremely happy about his decision to get a job, I had to sincerely apologize about accusing him of wanting cash for booze.  
I then asked him: Son, was there any change? He replied "Yes, About three fiddy." which he refused to give back. It was about that time I realized my son was a 7 stories tall crustacean from the paleolithic era. That damn loch ness Monster had gotten me again. Damnit, monsta, you ain't getting no three fiddy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The good outweighs the bad though.  
Let's imagine a new weapon that can do 300 damage as it's only upside, but it has much less ammo, much less speed, and some other downside.  
The upside on that is a hugely overpowered damage buff with some downsides that don't even matter.  
  
Now we can apply this to the loch.  
Upsides of faster speed, more distance, and more damage to Engineer crap.  
The downside of less ammo in the clip doesn't matter because the extra distance means you can sit back and fire from a distance and reload.  
The extra speed makes it much easier to hit *direct* shots on one person making the lower radius not matter at all.  
The lack of rollers doesn't matter much anyway, those are mostly for taking out nests which you can do easier with the extra damage to buildings.  
  
Loch isn't overpowered anymore but that doesn't mean it's bad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's how I deal with hackers.  
  
Complement the hacker like "Yo dude those Amby shots are on point, do you play CS:GO or something?" or "Duuuude you are amazing" because then they're like "Oh thanks man really means alot to me." and then I say to the team chat "Lmao that dude is hacking."  
  
Then I say "Hey I got a pizza on the way so I'm gonna leave now, peace out." and leave the hacker to do his thing.  
  
You really can't do anything about them but leave and they mostly want to get reactions of rage, so being cool, calm and collected about it and leaving for a different reason than "AY FUCK THIS GAME I HATE YOU LMAOBOXING FUCKS" doesn't give them the satisfaction of a reaction.  
  
Or since LMAOBox is VAC undetected I use my own VAC...cinator. Throw that bad boy onto my homeboy Pringle and let him go to town with some 1337 AWP skills. </TEXT>

You could also do contests for some of the items, maybe the person who can get a strange to the highest level first or something gets to choose an item.

<TEXT> I don't know why these two weapons get such a bad wrap together, +2 hp per second is laughable when you consider that he's losing a Shotgun, +15 hp on hit is a fair balance for losing a shot. How is basically +17 per hit broken?  
  
It's maybe +21 hp back between the time it takes for you to hit him again, it's really not that big a deal. </TEXT>

Imagine going to the beach and knowing that every grain of sand is unique (They aren't really but pretendsies) and that it's your duty to make sure that all the sand vanishes for your master plan of crashing a plane.  
  
You create a machine that can take something, scan a large area for copies of that thing and it will *poof* remove all of them.  
So you use it on a grain of sand and direct it at the beach. But nothing happens because they're all different apart from maybe 7 grains that are very similar.

<TEXT> [I like how these three comments] (http://i.imgur.com/qiH6aOu.png) show that he's wrong about what he just said too.  
He talked shit about hats. Downvotes are expected here.  
He used the term 'retarded' which is an insensitive term in most cases, including and especially when it comes to hats.  
And then there's a comment with upvotes because he was correct.  
  
There are comments with ~-30 points, while the other ones have ~-5. If people truly did downvote all his posts there would be more consistent negative comments.  
  
He even asked why something was being downvoted when clearly it was because he claimed to be able to "jump into any online fps and not be a noob" and that "not everyone starts out a noob" which is one of the stupider things I've seen there.

<TEXT> Can someone explain to me why no headshots is even on the CC as a downside? Aren't downsides meant to be downsides from the stock?  
Also where is the Overdose, that thing is great.  
  
  

Crusader's crossbow isn't that offensive and the bullets don't heal
all that well either.  

Let me stop you right fucking there. Medic is a Medic. Medic is a healer, not a fighter.  
You aren't meant to heal with the bolts more than the Medigun, it's for distance healing, fire it into a Soldier on low hp from a rollout and he can jump to wherever you are to get healed from the Medigun. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well for that Pyro to exist there needs to be a Demo who also never misses. I know the Loch is easy to hit with, but let's assume there's a pro Pyro and a pro Demo who aren't robots.  
  
The Demo shoots one pill that gets reflected, then he hits the Pyro with the second pill, then he misses the last one.  
  
Loch takes a small amount of skill to aim but that doesn't mean it always hits. Even a Scout can counter the LnL by jumping, Medic as a whole counters Loch due to overheal which doesn't seem to exist in discussion.  
  
Yes the Loch does need a nerf, no the loch is not horribly overpowered.  
  
Also it's like 2am for me so that's why my structuring for this reply is probably trash. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Now that you mention it, that is pretty interesting. The same principle almost applies in pubs, people would probably be running Stock or Kritz because they are the most effective in the hands of good and bad players, but the Vaccinator is horrendously bad in a bad players hands and a good player would be using Stock/Kritz because they are more effective.

<TEXT> Hard Countering Snipers isn't that bad when you consider that Sniper hard counters Medic/Engineer/Scout/Non-DDS Snipers/Uncloaked Spies. Then you give Sniper a bottle of Piss and the Bushwhacka and he counters anyone that feels like whipping out the Melee of their choice for a friendly game of "Let's fight with swords n shit".  
  
Vaccinator isn't even that good anyway so it basically *only* counters Sniper in that regard, denying Kritz doesn't deny damage. Just shoot an extra rocket at the nerd and he's gone. Use some communication to tell your team that the other Medic has Vax and then wait for the Med to go down before popping your Kritz.

<TEXT> A combination of both, every class has a specific role to fill and can fill it perfectly. Scout does the best job at making giant robots easy to kill and can collect money, Valve even made the Scout the money class by giving him health for collecting cash. Soldier gets easy damage and can work crowd control + the tank, the Buff Banner allows for extra damage on everything. Demo can kill uber Medics by right clicking. Heavy is just a Heavy, easy damage. Engineer kills anything not hit by the players with his sentry. Medic has a shield that prevents all incoming damage and has Kritz for easy kills.

<TEXT> Left mouse and Right mouse attack, secondary attack is bound to mouse 3.  
  
I'd use the worst weapons in the game, Sun on a Stick and the Sharpened Volcano Fragment. Amazing combo with the effects of both working together.  
  
Another viable option would be The Butterfly Knife and the Sandman, hit the guy with the ball then start torrenting anime to spike your ping so you can facestab everyone in the server. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Very simple premise, start with whatever you want, but the moment you get killed you must switch to that class and only use the weapon that killed you.  
Did you just get killed by the Eyelander? You Now are forced into the Eyelander until you die, at which point you switch to whatever killed you.  
  
You are allowed to use items that aren't in the same equip slot, for example the Tide Turner/Wee Booties or a Soldier backpack.  
  
Have fun letting Rockets kill you so you can use rockets.  
  
Also you should use the Auto Buy thing from scrap.tf before you do this, just to make sure you can use all the items you need. </TEXT>

"Scout seems to enjoy break dancing. You could say..." does seem like a pun after reading it, but I originally saw it as a possible discussion on many things, from an SFM of Scout breakdancing to a mod to make every class dance.  
Knowing how many puns are on this sub, I saw "Why don't snipers use jarate all that often?" and assumed it was a pun.  
"The Medic knew taping together his broken mug wasn't the best idea... " is the only one I knew for a fact was a pun instantly.

<TEXT> Short Circuit is the only one of those that is a *hard* counter.  Spycicle is easy to deal with, just keep wm1ing for two seconds and you'll probably find it, Pyro isn't even the only counter, Soldier's splash can reveal a cloaked Spy.  
DDS just means you need to wait for a second to shoot them, Sniper isn't the hard counter to Sniper, it's Spy.

<TEXT> Das 19. Jahrhundert brachte einen staunenswert gleichen staatlichen Einigungsproze. Die deutschen Stmme einten sich im Deutschen Reich, die italienischen Staaten im Knigreich Italien. In einem Jahre, 1866, hat das Schicksal beide Vlker sogar miteinander fr ihre staatliche Neugestaltung zum Kampf antreten lassen.
Heute erleben wir zum zweitenmal diese gleichartige Entwicklung. Ein Mann von skularem Ausma hat es als Erster unternommen, der in seinem Volke unfruchtbar gewordenen demokratischen Geisteswelt erfolgreich eine neue Idee entgegenzusetzen und in wenigen Jahren zum Siege zu fhren. Was der Faschismus fr Italien bedeutet, ist schwer abzuschtzen. Was er fr die Erhaltung der menschlichen Kultur geleistet hat, liegt bei den Sternen.
Wer wird nicht niedergezwungen bei einer Wanderung durch Rom oder Florenz von dem Gedanken, welches Schicksal diesen einmaligen Dokumenten menschlicher Kunst und menschlicher Kultur zugestoen sein wrde, wenn es Mussolini und seinem Faschismus nicht gelungen wre, Italien vor dem Bolschewismus zu retten.
Deutschland stand vor dieser selben Gefahr. Hier hat der Nationalsozialismus das Wunder der Rettung vollbracht. An diese beiden Staaten klammert sich nun in der geistigen Vorstellung unzhliger Menschen aller Rassen der Glaube an eine neue Renaissance unserer Zeit.
Die Solidaritt dieser beiden Regime ist daher mehr als eine Angelegenheit egoistischer Zweckmigkeit. In dieser Solidaritt liegt die Rettung Europas vor der drohenden bolschewistischen Vernichtung begrndet.
Als Italien seinen heroischen Kampf um sein Lebensrecht in Abessinien durchstritt, stand ihm Deutschland deshalb als Freund zur Seite. Im Jahre 1938 hat das faschistische Italien uns diese Freundschaft in reichlichem Mae wieder vergolten. Mge sich niemand in der Welt ber den Entschlu irren, den das nationalsozialistische Deutschland diesem Freunde gegenber gefat hat.
Es kann dem Frieden nur ntzlich sein, wenn es darber keinen Zweifel gibt, da ein Krieg gegen das heutige Italien, ganz gleich aus welchen Motiven vom Zaune gebrochen, Deutschland an die Seite des Freundes rufen wird.
Man lasse sich vor allem nicht von jenen anders beraten, die in jedem Lande als vereinzelte brgerliche Schwchlinge vegetieren und nicht verstehen knnen, da es im Vlkerleben als Ratgeber der Klugheit auer der Feigheit sehr wohl auch den Mut und die Ehre geben kann. Was das nationalsozialistische Deutschland betrifft, so wei es, welches Schicksal ihm beschieden wre, wenn es jemals einer internationalen Gewalt gelingen wrde, das faschistische Italien, ganz gleich unter welchen Motivierungen, niederzuzwingen.
Wir erkennen die Konsequenzen, die sich daraus ergeben mten, und sehen ihnen eiskalt ins Auge.
Das Schicksal Preuens von 1805 auf 1806 wird sich in der deutschen Geschichte kein zweites Mal wiederholen. Die Schwchlinge, die 1805 die Ratgeber des Knigs von Preuen waren, haben im heutigen Deutschland keine Ratschlge zu erteilen. Der nationalsozialistische Staat erkennt die Gefahr und ist entschlossen, sich auf ihre Abwehr vorzubereiten.
Ich wei dabei, da nicht nur unsere eigene Wehrmacht einer hchsten militrischen Beanspruchung gewachsen ist, sondern ebenso auch die militrische Macht Italiens. Denn so wenig das heutige deutsche Heer beurteilt werden kann nach der alten Bundesarmee etwa in der Zeit von 1848, so wenig kann das moderne Italien des Faschismus gewertet werden nach den Zeiten der italienischen staatlichen Zerrissenheit. Nur eine hysterische, ebenso unbelehrbare wie taktlose, dafr aber hchst bsartige Presse kann in so kurzer Zeit vergessen haben, da sie erst vor wenigen Jahren mit ihren Prophezeiungen ber den Ausgang des italienischen Feldzuges in Abessinien sich ebenso grndlich blamierte wie jetzt wieder in der Beurteilung der nationalen Krfte Francos im spanischen Feldzug.
Mnner machen die Geschichte!
Sie schmieden aber auch die Instrumente, die zur Gestaltung der Geschichte geeignet sind, und vor allem, sie geben ihnen ihren Hauch. Groe Mnner aber sind selbst nur die strkste, konzentrierteste Reprsentation eines Volkes.
Das nationalsozialistische Deutschland und das faschistische Italien sind stark genug, um gegen jedermann den Frieden zu sichern oder einen von unverantwortlichen Krften leichtfertig vom Zaun gebrochenen Konflikt entschlossen und erfolgreich zu beenden!
Das bedeutet nun nicht, da wir Deutsche  wie es in einer verantwortungslosen Presse jeden Tag geschrieben steht  einen Krieg wnschen, sondern es bedeutet nur, da wir
1.                  das Verstndnis dafr haben, da sich auch andere Vlker ihren Anteil an den Gtern der Welt sichern wollen, der ihnen kraft ihrer Zahl, ihres Mutes und ihres Wertes zukommt, und da wir
Danken wir Gott, dem Allmchtigen, da er unsere Generation und uns gesegnet hat, diese Zeit und diese Stunde zu erleben. </TEXT>

Buff Banner  
Black Box

<TEXT> I don't think that's a very good comparison, the issue the guy is having is that if Geel were to bet 3% of every pot he would receive 3% back because there's a 3% cut going to the site. If he puts in nothing he still gains 3% of the pot, if he puts in 3% and wins he gets it all, if he puts in 3% and loses he gets back the same value that he put in.  
  
The problem with your car example is that the salesman would not be gaining extra. I don't see a huge issue with what Geel is doing but I can see why others would. </TEXT>

"Bodyshotting prick"  
"Have you even played this game? Like seriously, have you?"  
"Your aim is worse than Michael J Fox's"  
"How many airshots do you have, -5?  
"Your (insert class here) looks like trash"  
"You are as presumptuous as you are poor and irish!"  
"Dude, you'd get a closed casket at the ugly cemetery!"  
"You're like a car crash in slow motion, it's like I'm watching you fly through a windshield"

So I choose some high tier yet slightly believable hats and told them I sold the KE to buy these.  
The reason I thought of doing this was because I had a 24 hour ban on backpack.tf for a price suggestion to make the Stout Shako 2 refined. Only one person knew that was the reason I was banned, it was pretty entertaining.  
  
I didn't actually paypal scam anyone and I never will, mostly because I don't have a paypal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you aren't sure how it works, here's basically how to use it!  
  
Type in some things you want to spam with the press of a button, for example  
  
what button sprints guys?  
how to fly as demonstration man?  
how to be boom boom king?  
where get burny bison hat?  
  
Then when you're finished with them, press "Clear the Server"  
You will get a huge wall of text, copy that and paste it into a notepad and [save it as] (http://i.imgur.com/ye6xGVv.png) "Trash.cfg", you will now want to be sure to save it as [all files] (http://i.imgur.com/tUrYe9g.png)  
  
Locate your ["cfg"] (http://i.imgur.com/3msMFLg.png) folder in your tf folder, look for literally any mod guide and you *should* get directions on how to get here, assuming you did it correctly you should be able to go into tf2 and type "exec trash" in the console, alternatively you could probably use autoexec or something but I'm not some turbonerd who knows how to use that.  
  
When you get into a server press the "P" key to say a random line from what you wrote!  
Enjoy getting votekicked! </TEXT>

<TEXT> It isn't really true like this though, Sniper can right click then left click for an instant 150 damage, killing most classes in one hit. Scout's speed is countered by the Engineer, Medic isn't the only class that can heal, you are correct in saying it is the easiest but Engineer and Heavy can do it too. There's also health kits but whatever. Being fast means nothing when you're facing a good Sniper. Healing isn't possible when you've been killed by a good sniper. Even a Heavy isn't safe if the sniper can hold his horses for a minute. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I was chilling out in Foundry having a good time when out of nowhere a bullet goes through my head and I'm like "Damn that was a good shot." And then I see who did it and go "That's probably a hacker." I came to this conclusion when I saw the Gibus. I also noticed that he was about 3,000,000 lightyears away from me when it happened, so I spectate him and I see some Sniper gameplay, now I'm gonna admit now that I like hackers. Kinda. I like seeing what they do and how proud they are of it, it's just funny to see the stuff they do sometimes, but being the good guy I am I told the server and the guy says "Nah it was just luck." to which I replied "I know what cheats look like, I know what it looks like to shoot far away from a dude and get a headshot." and he goes on his merry way chanting "Whatever bro".  
  
So we're on Coldfront now, my hands are freezing, my coffee is countering that. And then from across the map like some Robin Hood bullpoop an arrow goes directly into my soul, reaping me of all the enjoyment I had. Now others are starting to talk about it. Things are getting so heated that the snow is melting, I decide to take a few seconds to message a good friend of mine named [Max] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh1Vo6mLv0g) asking him how he feels about [hackers who deny it when it's obvious] (http://i.imgur.com/eBvudfa.png)  
  
The guy starts to get nervous at this point, almost as if I've spoken to his parents about his poor grades at school. He starts a votekick on me which fails with a final score of 2:14, he tells me that "People hack every day, get over it" and he promptly gets kicked in the nuts by everyone on the server.  
  
So anyway, what are your opinions on the Baby Face's Blaster? Do you think it's OP or just a Side Grade? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry I phrased the thing a bit wrong, I meant you can do more depending on the situation, the situation being that the rockets are aimed around the feet and the shotgun is aimed around the chest, I've seen ~100 damage a couple times, and the rocket launcher is a very splash based weapon most of the time, the splash damage does around 80.  
  
  
The 2 hp per second saved me like twice during the fight, and half of his kills were with the Shotgun anyway. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I personally love the thing (sorry /r/bisonmasterrace) but every now and again on MGE I'll get told that it "ruins MGE" and that the regen is super broken.  
  
I can see how on it's own it gives an advantage, but when they're using a Shotgun I don't see an advantage for me, they have a gun that can do more than the Rocket Launcher and think that the 2 hp per second is broken.  
  
What are your opinions on the Magic Conch? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd have to say the most fun weapon for me is the Liberty Launcher, combined with the gunboats you take a whopping 85% less rocket jump damage, You can take ~15 damage from 1 jump! It's so much fun to be able to use a damaging Rocket Jumper and a Direct Hit without the splash reduction!  
  
Least fun to use? I'm sorry to the people who like them, but any Sniper or Spy item annoys me and I can't find fun in them, it's such a boring way to play in my opinion, *opinion* being an important word here, I see the value of them on the team and know that they have so much power with 1 shot potential, but I hate playing as/with/against them in every way. I'm sorry I just hate them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They move like a texas rattle snake, they strike with no fear or remorse, they will never back down from a fight. These players are always destroying me, when I see a Heavy, it's game over. A Pyro? Dead. You could argue that I should just move away and flank them, but they will never. Stop. Coming. It's been an ordeal, especially when there's a Medic shoved firmly up the rectum of the Heavy. Does anyone else fear these... These, *monsters*?

I also have become a better Medic, the reason for this is that I know that only a skilled player could kill me with the Targe, it's really just about the confidence that I obtained when I got that kill. </TEXT>

Although I guess 300 x 0 is still 0...

<TITLE> To all the people who think the Direct Hit is to the Rocket Launcher as the Loch n Load is to the Grenade launcher... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-20 11:45:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The rocket launcher mostly is based on splash damage, removed by the Direct Hit's stats, you need to literally get direct hits to do anything with that. The Grenade Launcher, however, is based on mostly direct hits from the pills. The shattering pills from the Loch aren't as bad as the Direct Hit's rockets that basically shatter on surfaces anyway.  
  
TL;DR, this isn't really that long so not reading it just kinda makes you lazy if I'm being honest, but pretty much the play style for Soldier changes to being direct rockets and Demo's doesn't because direct pills are his thing I guess. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My friend was playing some TF2, can't remember the map, I think it was ctf_well, and I joined on an alt account to start pissing him off by doing dumb things like whacking his sentry when I'm not an Engineer or building right next to him because he HATES that. So I'm doing that and then I guess I walked onto a metal spawn or something because he starts talking to me in the Skype about how a Soldier took his metal. So he picks up his dispenser and says "No. This Soldier is not using my dispenser." So I walk into him as a medic and start calling for a dispenser, he gets pissed and starts to call a vote kick on me, I plead in the chat and say it's my third game and that I'm sorry and I will try harder, I stay in, but he still wont let me use the dispenser, he picks it up every time and while that's happening I need to pretend to be on Reddit laughing at something. Eventually I stop and leave him be. Until a Pyro comes and sets everyone on fire including me. At that point I stood next to his dispenser spamming thanks while other people enjoy the heals. He picks it up and burns to death. I think it was worth it on his end. </TEXT>

- Boston Boom Bringer, because my heart's a stereo 3  
  
- Merc's Pride Scarf, because it's pretty cold in the Southern Hemisphere but I dislike the Muffler.  
  
- Buds.... I listen to alot of music, I'm sure most of you would have buds on this list.  
  
- Fed Fightin' Fedora/Killer's Exclusive, M'lady.  
  
- Digit Divulgers, because it is still cold down here.  
  
- Buck Turner All Stars, you know I got me some of them dog.  
 
- Stereoscopic Shades, because they just look cool.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Now don't get me wrong, Muselk is an amazing content creator and tf2 player, but does anyone else notice a huge spike in usage for Mad Milk Atomizer Scouts or Diamondback Spies? Normally when I see one of these I just let them do what they do, but when we have 9 of the same loadout on a team, it gets kinda mundane. His loadouts are for the most part relatively average, but people are taking them as being the undeniable best loadouts (Even though he says in his Soldier video that there is no best class) Has anyone else noticed the large amount of his sets in TF2 lately? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Feel free to yell (Voice)MEDIC! Because that's what I'm here for, to heal you in your darkest of times. If you're on full health, yell out to me anyway, an overheal is indispensable these days. (get it? Because a dispenser can't give you an overheal. I thought it was pretty funny.) If you're a Baby Face's Blaster Scout then I'll heal you in a couple of seconds, You're a pretty quick guy. If you picked up a health kit when I'm on low health then I'll give you a quick overheal and wait for it to come back, When I'm on fire and you're a Pyro, I don't hate you for not airblasting, you might not know how to do that, maybe you don't know it puts out a player, and I'm fine with that. But I swear to god if you wear a Lime Green or Pink loadout I will never heal you. Because Y'all look stupid. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Please, pick up money when one of these two situations arise, the first one is when I, as a Scout, have passed away, think of it as my dying wish. The second time would be when you kill a robot really really far away from the big group of players.  
  
I know you're thinking 'But Scout, it's your job to pick up the money, and it helps you by giving you a huge health boost!'  
  
While that may be true, I cannot get all of the money all of the time, and the health gain, while being extremely beneficial to me, isn't always too important to me, by the time I have picked up $20, I will already be at around 250 hp, it doesn't hurt to stand on money, In fact, it probably feels good seeing as you can brag about how rich you are since you can walk on money and it probably feels really soft.

<TEXT> So I was in a little plane in GTA Online and some guy in a huge jet comes up to me and tries to shoot me outta the sky. I had my Kinect on and was going 'Come on man I just wanna fly' and he sounded like a 12 year old going 'NO FUCK YOU I'M GONNA KILL YOU' so I made an evasive move and flew directly up and he exploded. So I promptly yelled 'THESE ARE MY SKIES MOTHER FUCKER!! KNEEL BEFORE THE MIGHT OF THE CROP DUSTER!'

What do you guys think were great things from this year? Some nice cosmetics? The BOOST you get from the Baby Face's Blaster? Or even just a tweak to an older weapon? </TEXT>
