<TEXT> So I find with most of the books that I read, i read the text but i don;t really retain a lot of the information. This isn't usually too big a problem because most books don;t have too many different plots/characters/etc. However I'm currently reading the Silmarillion, and dear God is there a lot of information. Does anyone have any tricks on how to retain the information that you read better? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I'm just starting to follow the beginner PPL Routine (https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/) and it says to add weight linearly 

    2.5kg/5lbs for upper body lifts (bench press, row, overhead press)
    2.5kg/5lbs for squats
    5kg/10lbs for deadlifts

I'm assuming this means add this to only the first lift of the day and with thew accessory lifts increase the weight when i can do the max number of reps per set in the specified range. 5 Pounds per week seems like a lot for bench though, I've only managed to up it by about 10 pounds in the past 2 months (not following this routine albeit). Is that really feasible while eating at a 700ish cal deficit since I'm on a cut?

I'm wondering if I could do a PPLPP and still see good results? I'm really set on working out on every weekday because it fits really nicely into my schedule and I like my weekends to relax. I have a pretty good base for legs already from running and cross country skiing. </TEXT>

I'm assuming yes because that is what happens during summer, but just wanted to make sure. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

* Budget range: ~ $1500

* Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): Gaming

* Screen size preference: 15''

* OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux): Windows 

* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): Diablo 3: High setting   Skyrim: Medium- High, 45 Fps

* Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.): Everything for engineering school (CAD type software).

* Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support): Self Support

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business
compatibility): None

* Any particular style that you like (examples are great): Prefer the style of Y50

* Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, the other, or balanced)

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight: balanced, medium life for medium weight

* Build quality -vs- Low price: build quality

* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: high performance

**Would you pay a premium for something that has:**

* High resolution screen: yes

* A great keyboard: yes

* A great touchpad/mouse buttons: yes

* Great audio: yes

**List any features that are critical:** (e.g. Optical drive, USB 3.0, SD card slot, ethernet port, HDMI port, bluetooth, VGA port, removable battery, glossy screen, matte screen, etc.)

Basically since i'm in Canada my options are limited so I've narrowed it down to the Canadian N550JK version (https://www.cdw.ca/shop/products/ASUS-N550JK-DB71-15.6in-Core-i7-4700HQ-Windows-8.1-64-bit-12-GB-RAM/3338923.aspx?enkwrd=asus%20n550jk-db71#TS) and the Canadian Y50 (http://shop.lenovo.com/ca/en/laptops/lenovo/y-series/y50/#customize)

If i got the ASUS id replace the HDD with a 250GB SSD and move the HDD to the optical drive. If i get the Y50, the upper model already has an SSD (only 512GB but should be enough storage). The GTX860M is about 30% better on average framerate than the GTX850M. So basically, which would you go for? i love the red look of the Y50, but it is more pricey (i would get a discount of prolly a few hundred of the ASUS). Is it worth the extra? </TEXT>
