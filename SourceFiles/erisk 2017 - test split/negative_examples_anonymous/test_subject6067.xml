<TEXT> Hi everyone!  My husband and I finally were able to get a plot in our community garden (yayyyyy)!  We've never gardened before (outside of succulents grown in containers on our balcony), so we're unsure of what we should do next.  Currently there are things growing in our plot, but I really want to pull everything out, build some raised beds, and start growing some delicious vegetables.  

Here is an instagram photo of what's currently growing in our plot: https://instagram.com/p/1RT2cNkMgd

We are in Zone 10a :)

Any help would be appreciated! Thank you DIY :)

<TITLE> My 1 week experience with the Surge </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-02 08:27:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys! My husband bought me a Fitbit Surge for Christmas and I thought Id let you know my experience wearing it so far. 

Band: The band is thick on my wrist, but its quite comfortable.  The closure is like a regular watch so theres no need to worry about it undoing itself.  There is also a piece that slips over the extra watch flap and locks it down. This way you dont have to worry about all that extra watch band hanging over if your wrist is thin.  Ive been wearing it all day and only taking it off to shower. So far I havent experienced the gross smell that most watch bands usually give.

Clock face:  Its big and very easy to navigate.  The backlight is great, but I have found myself tapping it a few times at night for the light to come on.  The swiping is easy, but sometimes I find that its displaying other screens except for the time.  Im sure its because Ive touched it on accident or something.  Perhaps there is a way to lock the screen on clock?

Music control: Love running spotify on my phone and being able to control it with my watch.  

Text/Call notification:  I have yet to receive a single text on my watch.  I have however been notified 1 out of 10 incoming calls.  Ive reset it once so maybe I'll have to do it again. 

Heart rate: I havent tested the accuracy, but its been pretty fun to see what my heart rate is throughout the day and night.  I have noticed that on some nights my pulse is 10 points lower than on other nights.  Is that normal? 

GPS: The GPS is a little wacky.  Ive only used it 2x but both times the google map drawing was completely off.  Ill use it a few more times before I write to fitbit.  

*Battery: Charging seems to only take an hour, but man does this thing have a terrible battery life.  I charged it till it was full yesterday afternoon and it's already showing that it's 1/2 way through right now.  Is this happening to anyone else with the Surge?  I'm so sad because when I wore the Force it seemed it last forever! 

Thats it so far.  If you guys have any questions Id be more than happy to answer them :)

*edited to add the note on battery life </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi guys, the last 3 days my iphone 5 has suddenly been having problems with my home wifi.  I thought it was because I hadn't upgraded to the new iOS, but since I've upgraded it's still been the same.  Either I don't see my wifi, connect for a minute then it drops, or it's painfully slow.  I've tried to reset network settings, change my DNS to 8.8.8.8, turn off location settings, and a bunch of other online suggestions I've found.  I don't know why things have gotten so bad overnight while all the other devices in this house seems the same.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thank you :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Trolol420!  You can definitely add a little bit of "extra" oil after the trace but some soap makers argue that you can't determine which oils become saponified during the process.  Since most of the saponification happen during the first 24 hours, even after trace it's still working.  I have no idea if this is true, but I have also read that some soap makers add more expensive oils to superfat the soap after trace.  Because they say that the qualities are retained.  I personally haven't experimented with adding oils after, but I don't see why you couldn't.  Jojoba is pretty shelf stable so even if there's extra I saponified, I wouldn't be as worried about DOS compared to grapeseed or flax oils.  I'm not sure if I helped or not lol lol.

<TEXT> I've gotten altitude sickness the last 4 times I've flown.  The first 30 minutes I'm completely fine.  Then after about an hour I find myself dry heaving and breathing fast the rest of the flight.  I don't know what to do.  Any tips would be greatly appreciated :D  Thank you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I make soap and sell soap, but I still love trying out other people's products :).  I love looking at the ingredients label so anything with fun or exotic butters always catches my eye.  I love an all olive oil soap but I know that it's going to be a little slimy in the shower and have little lather.  I don't personally care if it's colored, but I do LOVE a good exfoliation soap for my body.  For my face I like an unscented or very lightly scented with essential oils, uncolored, bar of soap made with lots of olive oil. </TEXT>

Since I don't have a beard, I'm not really sure what makes a great shaving puck.  There are lots of glycerin soaps that give extra lather, but do you guys think that they perform well enough? Do you guys have a preference when it comes to an all veggie soap or one made with tallow or lard?  Do you like a soap puck that comes in a container already or prefer a puck by itself?  Thank you guys so much!   </TEXT>

I just pick them out and toss them.  Suddenly in the last 2 months there's been more but today I just checked and I couldn't find any worms in the top 2 bins!  Everything I see moving are small maggots!  Now.. I'm not sure exactly what I should do.  If I stop feeding them I'm afraid that my worms will starve (I think they are already) but there seems to be too many for me to pick out.  Any help would be appreciated :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> We will be on the east coast so there will be 2 full sized luggages and 5 carry ons along with purses, etc.  I figure pulling everything during rush hour can't be fun.  It does seem like getting a larger cab and splitting it is cheaper than renting a shuttle for $20 a head.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes I agree, I'm almost 100% sure we'll just take a bus to AC.  AC to DC... we might just rent a car and split it.  Now I"m just trying to figure out the toll roads situation.  I don't even have an idea of about how much it will cost since it looks like we'll be hitting up 3-4 toll stops. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello East Coasters! 5 of us will be in NYC till Friday and wanted to check out Atlantic City before we leave.  I wanted to know if you guys had any tips on how to get there from Times Square.  I saw that there are a few bus options and was thinking about trying Greyhound's Lucky Streak.  Is that a good choice?  

After a fun Friday in Atlantic city, we will have to travel to DC on Saturday and needed a recommendation on how to get there.  Are there bus options?  Should we subway it?  Rent a car? Any tips would be appreciated! Thank you ahead of time :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi!  Not sure what your exact budget is, but I would go to travelzoo or groupon and check out some of the deals they have for hotel or group activites.  Temecula (lots of wine tastings here) is only 90 minutes from LA so you can still party at a club on a day and checkout some orchards on another.  Another lower cost option would be hanging out at the beach for the day for a picnic/bbq and stay for a bonfire at night.  Cheap and fun!  Hope that helps :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> Darn I just removed the URLS using webmaster tools the other day.  I'm not sure how long it takes for google to change it.  I guess if I don't see a change I'll try the 301.  Thank you SquareWheel. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys, I have a small photoblog where I post photos from travel, things I make, etc..  Recently I've found photos of mine on tumblrs, and other wordpress blogs.  I'm complimented that they'd like it..but should I be watermarking my photos so that i get a little extra traffic?  What are your opinions? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi guys!  When I launched my photoblog, I had a few extra categories which I deleted within a few days.  Now that it's been almost 2 months since my wordpress blog has been up, google search and  webmasters tools are still showing those deleted categories.  I've submitted my sitemap since the initial category deletion, but it hasn't worked.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you! </TEXT>
