<TEXT> Um, no.

 Catholicism and its adjectival form Catholic are used as broad terms for describing specific traditions in the Christian churches in theology, doctrine, liturgy, ethics, and spirituality.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholicism

The major difference about Catholics from other Christians (disclaimer: I am a baptised Catholic, but not a trained or practicing one), is that they believe the Pope (you the one, ~~Dr. EverythingBeAllright~~ the guy with the tall hat ^^^^^St ^^^^^Peter ^^^^^was ^^^^^a ^^^^^rabbit that lives in the Vatican) speaks the word of God (or something similar), and therefore holds sway over the Catholic Church and its believers world-wide.

The reason people freaked out a bit about JFK being a Catholic, is that they thought that would mean that Rome could secretly control or otherwise influence JFK if he was elected.  A somewhat realistic fear based on hi~~s~~story]. </TEXT>

As an IT guy and wire-runner in another life, I always recommend to go through a place and check all the telco outlets.  Open them, and clean them.  Yep, clean the contacts.  Old wiring will accumulate dust even in between the contacts that are screwed-down.  Unscrew 'em, clean or cut the wire, and re-attach.

For myself, I will go through a premise and re-punch/attach/whatever all the wiring that all my future communications depend on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nothing empirical.  Only concerns regarding family ties and/or loyalties to the emperor.

AFAIK from what I learned at Manzanar, there were no discovered cases of Japanese-American disloyalty of any of the people interned or otherwise having served in the US armed forces during that time.

The problem is always with "concern" though, and the fear mongering that goes with it.  This was also on the heels of a lot of *"they took our jobs"* backlashing against Japanese immigrants.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If I may add a point, not doing well at something is not a sufficient reason to be racist.  Particularly not a reason to round up an entire race of people, force them to lose all of their possessions (only allowed to take a suitcase), take them out to the middle of nowhere (hundreds of miles from where they lived) and make them build their own "housing", keep them within a fortified encampment with guard towers, force them to sign documents with unclear ambiguous statements, ...   you know what - I'm just gonna stop here.

Manzanar was disturbingly close to a Nazi concentration camp.  I realize that a nazi comparison is strong, but in terms of US history, its true.  Hindsight always shows you at your worst, but its not an excuse for a "but" statement.  What we did was wrong.  There are not "but"s to excuse this.

In this situation, they did not ground or otherwise prevent and helicopters or other aircraft into the airspace to assist in putting out the fire.

I'm not saying its not a serious issue, etc, etc.  But its untrue that any aircraft were grounded or deterred because of the Cajon Pass fire on Friday afternoon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have no substantiated idea.

That said, my belief leans toward food processing and/or pesticides.  "Organic" food definitely gives me less, if no, noticeable/quantifiable reactions.

What has been a recurring indicator for this, in my experience, is nuts, seeds, and seeded fruits.  If I buy cheap stuff I likely will have allergic reaction that turns into acne.  If I buy better (i.e. organic) stuff, its much less likely to happen - if at all.

My food allergy is tied with acne breakouts, so I can see/feel/itch direct correlations between these things when I eat them.  I will itch within hours, and breakouts will follow.  I really cannot say how this compares to others. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would agree that diet influences acne.  I first noticed this ~20 years ago when I started to travel for work.  I have observed the following over the years:

1. Food in the US gives me more acne problems than any other country.
2. Food from grocery stores in major cities gives me more acne problems. Smaller rural/self-sufficient farming areas give me less acne problems for the same kinds of foods I would eat in an urban/industrial environment.

I stand by the assertion that its food, and not pollution, because I know (have been tested) my acne is food-allergy driven. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Re-read what you just said, while recalling the contents of the video.

If he was on the shoulder, the cop would have cited him for it.  The rider said that he was in the lane; which in this context of a motorcycle passing cars is called "lane-splitting".

Watching for motorcycles on your right is more dangerous than on your left, as a vehicle passenger-side mirror (typically) makes the image smaller.  A motorcycle is difficult enough to distinguish in heavy traffic.

To answer your question, AFAIK the motorcycle would be at fault.  Lane-splitting isn't technically "legal".  Its just something that CHP turns a blind-eye to.  But they do not declare it as a legal/valid thing for motorcycles to do, and so it does not have any right-of-way privs, etc. </TEXT>

Source: I live in a heavily Mexican populated neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, and this is my loose interpretation of what I see/hear going on around me *every f'ing weekend*.

Wikipedia offers this expanded [explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincea%C3%B1era):

 Quinceaera (pronounced: [knsee]; feminine form of "fifteen-year-old"), also called fiesta de quince aos, fiesta de quinceaera, quince aos or simply quince, is the celebration of a girl's fifteenth birthday in parts of Latin America and elsewhere in communities of people from Latin America. This birthday is celebrated differently from any other as it marks the transition from childhood to young womanhood. Latin myths and tradition tell about how girls were prepared to be married by the age of fifteen; in the years prior to their fifteenth birthdays, girls were taught to cook, weave, and about child rearing by the elder women in their communities in preparation for their lives as married women. Although it is agreed that the traditions of quinceaeras originated in ancient Aztec culture, the celebrations today vary significantly across countries; celebrations in some countries, for example, have taken on more religious overtones than in others. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm torn, but I'm seriously tempted to buy some sort of gun (bb maybe?) to shoot these fucking things down.

Footage like this looks really cool until you are outside somewhere trying to enjoy the scenery/view/etc, and some jackass is buzzing around with one of these things.  These things are not quiet.  They are just like other powerful RC devices: *they are loud*. 

I had the displeasure of having to deal with a jackass up on Glacier Point (Yosemite National Park) who was running one of these things back and forth along the cliffs edge getting footage of himself standing there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. Determine where you get the best antenna reception.
1. Analyze how you can achieve the cabling from your TV to that antenna placement.
1. Act upon your knowledge.  Determine a wiring route.  Measure twice, and buy (at least) a few feet more than (you think) you need.

For my current residence, I ran it under the living room rug, around the perimeter of the room.  Its a longer run, but it doesnt get stepped on or felt/seen in any way when walking through the area.

I also took the opportunity to run other advantageous wiring across the room under the rug.

At a previous residence I used a staple gun to tack the wiring around the wall baseboard, at the crease with the floor.  If you need ideas, Home Depot has tools and accessories for projects like this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can anyone recommend a game/server where characters have moral fortitude, stand up for what they believe in, and act as a unified team with their compatriots?

I've been a previous fan of Left4Dead for these reasons, but I'm looking for a larger group-play option.  And I'd really like to play on servers were the admin/mods listen to the players, and move forward with decisions that everyone wants - and not just what seems advantageous for attracting more future players.

Any recommendations would be appreciated, thanks!!! </TEXT>

The underlying problem is admin/mod communications.  Many subs are not directly effected by this problem and operate autonomously.  But that doesn't mean that there isnt just cause to show solidarity.

<TEXT> I've seen the responses.  I have been reading through related threads both present and past four 4+ hours now.  I didnt know who Ellen Pao was before today.  I previously could have cared less.  After today's events and what I have read: *I care.*

talking in comments isnt protesting - its discussing.  thats what we typically do on reddit: we discuss things.  protesting is taking action against something, and in this case the protest is using silence.  we cant protest in our discussions because, a) its useless, because b) we cannot interact in any meaningful way with the admins.

you obviously dont care about the issue at hand, and that's fine.  you don't have to be vested in this, or care what direction the site is going in.  and I dont mean that in a sarcastic or demeaning manner.  reddit, like many sites, is a tool.  Use or care for the tool how you want.

If you dont care, then dont complain about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To additionally try and quell your disbelief of my story: This was 20 some-odd years ago.  IIRC, ferries out of Hyannis (to Nantucket Island) were halted because of ~20ft swells.  However,  Nantucket Airlines (think the TV show "Wings") was still willing to fly.  The dual prop -as I remember it- sat ~6-8 people behind the 'cockpit' seats.  It was an open cabin, and you could elect to sit up-front next to the pilot if you wanted to.  There was no divider of any kind.  I had never been in an airplane like it before (or since), so I opted to do it (no one else wanted to).  It was fascinating, but I had no idea what I was in for, and had no idea just how precarious the weather in the sky really was.  It scared the crap out of me at the time.  The pilot told me not to touch anything, but I totally had a steering wheel-like device floating back and forth in front of me - doing all the same movements as the pilots one.

Nantucket was awesome.  The weather cleared the following day, and I lived  delusionally like a king for about a week, playing about in the vicinity of some ridiculously rich people.

Bonus story you can choose to believe or not:  Don't disturb nesting seagulls out in Coatue refuge.  They will dive bomb/shit on you!  I got chased down a beach for about a quarter mile before they stopped trying to shit bomb me.  Running top-speed in soft sand dunes is a real PITA.

I didn't know I invaded their space, but they sure didn't care.  I wouldn't even know if you can still go out there like I did back then, but at the time you could take any vehicle out there that had ....  "dunes pass"?  or something like that.  The rich people I was a guest of had one on their old beat-up Jeep Cherokee, and so I went out there at their suggestion.  Note: You have to heavily deflate your tires or you *will* get stuck out there.   I got stuck twice and had to keep deflating as well as use wood blanks that were in the back/trunk (it seemed like excessive deflation, but it was eventually the only thing that worked).  The entry to the dunes/refuge areas had air pumps (and deflation/pressure guages) for [de/re]-inflating your tires when you got went in/out.  Totally weird for a "city boy" like me, but it was an awesome adventure.

I dont know if the above is still possible, but it was absolutely true ~20 years ago.  I took the ferry back to Hyannis when it was over. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I took-off in a small dual-prop aircraft in high-winds once.  As soon as the wheel lost tracktion with the runway, we were pushed sideways about 30 feet.  The entire flight (to an island) we had to fly with heavy skew? into the wind to fight the push.  Being a small plane, it felt like we were flying at a 45 degree angle the entire time.  Bonus: Being a small plane, I had the luck of getting to sit up-front with the pilot and got to see everything that was going on really well, and the fight that the pilot had with the plane the entire time.

You can imagine what the landing was like...   coming in, pointing away from the runway at an angle to fight the wind - but moving straight toward it - and really fast.  The pilot wanted ground asap.  As soon as the wheels get traction, the plain swings abruptly straight - like you just got... umm...  I really cant compare it to anything else.  It was the oddest sensation of a big shove with a straighten your shit out attitude attached from mothernature. It was fucking terrifying.

I will never fly under those circumstances again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its not clear if the movie is following the canon of the comics here, as they never really address it.  But in an earlier movie we see the image of the [comic] Phoenix Force move through the water at Lake Alkali(sp?).  So, a lot of us see that as the Phoenix Force coming to her to save her - showing it as a separate and self-conscious entity, like in the comics.

<TEXT> I think this is an otaku version of a newish womens-fashion thing I recently started seeing infomercials for.  The "thing" is this band-like fabric that wraps your torso and goes over your pants.  The main thing about it is that if you have a short shirt, if you bend over of whatever, you wont expose your midriff.  If you crouch, you wont expose your panties/whale-tale.

I dunno wtf you call it, but its some sort of modesty apparel, so you can still dress in trampy styles, but not expose your undies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recommend 2-3 max.  It can be dangerous going alone with no one to watch for police, and particularly; no one to watch you back from miscreants.

Anything over two, I recommend that you have some distance between each other.   Any additionally paired people that are standing close to each other can appear suspicious.  What looks normal walking down the street or otherwise hanging out, does not look normal behind a building or in the shadows. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Although he approached it incorrectly, to give him the benefit of the doubt, he may be attempting to prevent his own liability against sexual harassment.  By this, I mean, he has to constantly observe his students for their physical behavior.  He was to watch for posture, as well as foot/leg/arm/hand positioning.  As a man, I can only imagine this leaves him open to accusations of lecherous behavior.

I dont think there is any "right way" to approach this with him, aside from genuine honesty.  He used stereotypical male humor to approach an issue, that unfortunately perpetuates a sexual bias.  If he seems sincere, it may be better to just let it slide.  Not everyone is an expert in political correctness, nor is every situation an appropriate teaching moment.

Again - only if he seem to be genuinely sincere in his policy reasons, I would approach this after-the-fact, with him directly or to his employer.  Doing anything during will only add to the discomfort of the situation, and continue to downgrade your paid-for learning experience.

Thinking on it more, I wouldn't approach this with him directly.  I would approach the company, so it can be a learning experience at a higher-level, and hopefully be something that is disseminated to all of their staff.  I would keep my name out of it, and if the teacher seemed sincere, I would not name him specifically either.  I would want this to be a positive outcome event, not a negative one.  If it becomes negative (if someone is penalized, loses their job, etc) the moment of positive influence is lost - and negative stereotypes will be further enforced. </TEXT>

They went on forever and they, when I, we lived in Arizona

And the fields always had little fluffy cows

And they moved down, they were long and clear

And there were lots of stars at night

And when it would rain it would all turn, it, they were beautiful

The most beautiful cows as a matter of fact

The sunsets were purple and red and yellow and on fire

And the cows would catch the colors everywhere

That's neat, 'cause I used to look at them all the time when I was little

You don't see that... </TEXT>

Why not make/keep this a batch script?  If you have to edit a text file anyway; a batch script is a more visibly open/trustable solution to share.

In this case, I don't see an advantage to compiling this into an .exe, when this doesn't appear to be doing anything outside of the conventions of a batch script.

<DATE> 2015-05-23 01:43:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been working on a new subreddit using Naut 3.2 (I'm a Naut newb), and testing how things look/work.  I'm stuck confirming that certain sprites used for types of posts are working properly:

1. **self-post** (grey speech icon [OK])
1. **link-post** (globe icon [*not* OK], seeing reddit snoo icon instead])
1. **mod-post** (green icon [*not* OK], seeing grey speech icon instead])
1. **nsfw-post** (pink eyeball icon [OK])

Any insight into what I am doing wrong is greatly appreciated! I'm assuming that I haven't found the right sprite-usage FAQ or something.  The subreddit I am testing in is:

http://www.reddit.com/r/opentrackerproject/

Its locked, but there are some test posts visible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> With Filebot, use the "-get-subtitles" switch with the "-lang" switch. Also use "-type srt" if you are using SubRip subtitles. Filebot will use the medianame you search against, and append ".lang.srt" to the end of the subtitle file it downloads.  Here are the basics for the command-line:

    filebot.exe -get-subtitles "medianame" --lang eng --output srt </TEXT>

<TEXT> So weird, as I am seeing the opposite on other clients (instead of seeing the 3-letter sub language, its only seeing a 2-letter sub language).  I can't imagine wtf is going on, but its hella annoying.

AFAIK, the SubRip format (.srt) uses 3-letter language codes.  Its unofficial, but a generally observed practice.  When I download subs (with Filebot for example), the subs are named with a 3-letter language code. </TEXT>

<TEXT> regarding H.264 video, this is quite easy to verify.  use MediaInfo to determine what which H.264 profile/level was used, and compare that to client playback specs.

In all cases I have encountered, its a matter of the media having been authored at too high a level (codec settings that are too high-quality for the client to playback smoothly).

<TEXT> Some outstanding points:

1. we dont know anything about the video encoding/bitrates you are trying to playback.
2. we dont know anything about the throughput from your NAS.
3. You say the videos dont playback, and so you "invariably rip a higher bitrate version"?

Some things to do:

1. Get file transfer stats to/from your NAS.  On windows, this is a very small/convenient tool:  http://www.totusoft.com/lanspeed1.html
2. Test against another Plex client.

<TEXT> Does this happen with direct play or transcoding?  I have a Samsung UN60H6350 (quad-core), and I am able to playback highly-encoded videos just fine - but saying that in a non-technical manner is kind of meaningless.  Specs are what will tell you if something is a yay or nay in terms of compatibility.

Can you give us any additional details about the encoding of the videos?  Are you making them yourself?  Perhaps you can re-encode in a manner that is more compatible with your specific TVs decoding capabilities.

As an example, I can easily direct-play across a 802.11g WLAN from a c2007 Sony VAIO Core 2 Duo - and that thing is an outdated piece of crap.  I can transcode too, but it beats the hell out of the processor (100% pegged).   If having to transcode from it, I run scripts to stop all sorts of things from running on it (tasks and services) to drop it to the greatest amount of processor availability I can.

I honestly think your problem is with the coding of the videos specifically.  Something is probably out of spec there. </TEXT>

Document the bedbugs as well, and show them the documentation - *dont just talk about it*.   They should be highly motivated about the bedbugs because of the risk of infestation and spreading.  The allergens as a proved health risk should also motivate them.

You can then use that same documentation against them if you decide to escalate the matter. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for your reply.

No cropping on my part - whats shown is the full extent of the image (it was a still image, not a moving image).

Its from one of the Evangelion "rebuild" movies, and is an image that is shown very briefly during some dramatic dialog, so I cant help but wonder if there is some hidden meaning/text that goes beyond simply "crew room" or "crew compartment".

I wonder that sometimes a word or two in Japanese means one thing, but has similar pronunciations that mean something else that is more devious. </TEXT>

U0065, 3rd Floor, Jalan OKK Awang Besar, Wilayah Persekutuan, 87007 Labuan, Malaysia

This is a *front* address for many various "companies" that you can find online.  I'm not saying this un-legitimizes BiteSMS, but IMHO its sketchy for a legit company to share a mailing address.

I loved their product, I paid for their product, and I miss it.  But I dunno to what extent I would call them a "legit company" outside of a couple of devs. </TEXT>

Its a bit annoying, but it gets the job done and you only have to tweak the problematic titles. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Bored waiting for 4: A question of the second Angel / book of Enoch allusion </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-30 18:11:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For years I have come across references from various sources alluding to Adam being the second angel created by God.  [This can also be found in the evageeks wiki](http://wiki.evageeks.org/Adam#Allusions):

 *The second book of Enoch refers to Adam as the Second Angel. In NGE, Adam is the First Angel, and Lilith, not Adam, is the Second Angel. However, all humans descend from the Second Angel, whether Adam in Enoch, or Lilith in Evangelion.*

This has always annoyed me because its always been listed without a proper citation/reference.  So, I recently went on a hunt to find out what the real deal is about it, and found a [*Google Books source*](https://books.google.com/books?id=Wgk3AAAAMAAJ lpg=PA40 ots=XmQ3ouHfu3 dq=%22secrets%20of%20enoch%22%20%22second%20angel%22 pg=PA40#v=onepage q=%22secrets%20of%20enoch%22%20%22second%20angel%22 f=false) of the Book of Enoch scripture detailing God's creation of Adam:

 [11] And I placed him upon the earth like a second angel in an honourable great and glorious way

 [12] And I made him a ruler to rule upon the earth and to have My wisdom

I don't think any of this substantiates the book of Enoch/Adam/Lilith connection.

Thoughts? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I find Time Warner to be the most cost-effective (I cant find a better deal) option for 20/2 mb service.  The service has been good, with only a handful of experienced late-night outages in the past couple of years.  Streaming and downloading has been consistent.

I'm sure others have their complaints, but over-all my experience has been good.  I quarterly check for better deals, and can never find one. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [bug] plex doesn't properly order single digit with double-digit numbers </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-28 05:48:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **Example Problem:**  Custom sort order all Marvel Cinematic Universe titles like so:

|Title|Sort Title|
|:-|:-|
|Captain America: The First Avenger|Marvel 1|
|Iron Man|Marvel 4|
|Iron Man 2|Marvel 5|
|Thor|Marvel 7|
|The Incredible Hulk|Marvel 8|
|The Avengers|Marvel 10|
|Iron Man 3|Marvel 12|
|Thor 2|Marvel 15|
|Captain America: The Winter Soldier|Marvel 17|
|Guardians of the Galaxy|Marvel 19|

**Displayed order ends up being:**

1. Captain America: The First Avenger
1. The Avengers
1. Iron Man 3
1. Thor 2
1. Captain America: The Winter Soldier
1. Guardians of the Galaxy
1. Iron Man
1. Iron Man 2
1. Thor
1. The Incredible Hulk

**So, what's the problem?**  Plex is numerically ordering as 1, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 4, 5, 7, 8.  This is apparent in the raw movies order as well as any filtered displays such as collections.  Its numerically linking against the first number.

**Work-around:** Prefix any single-digit numbers with a 0, and Plex will display it in the correct numerical order.  So 1 as 01, 2 as 02, and so on... </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is an interesting concept, but tracker lists aren't just about putting a blank line between listings.  Blank lines are meant to separate tracker *tiers*.

Tiers are groupings of tracker URLs that fall within the dominion of the same hostname address - in order of connection preference.

Example of how tiered-grouping works:

    udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969/announce
    
    udp://open.demonii.com:6969/announce

<TEXT> I'm not sure I understand where this effort is going.  Having a directory map can be useful when you are organizing large amounts of files, but I don't see the value if this is for generating a download queue for re-downloading content.

imho this is making more required effort - not less.

I would be concentrating on organizing magnet or .torrent info, so that could be directly fed into a client like utorrent. </TEXT>

<TITLE> A couple of old but interesting reads regarding the nature of the multiple/different endings of NGE/EOE </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-17 10:37:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I recently came across these tidbits, and thought some of you might find them interesting.  The first suggests multiple realities (or what some are considering a possible time-loop/divergence) for the different endings of NGE, while the second is a counter argument:

[Here's a specific extract from a cached copy of an otherwise very long and opinionated NGE faq/overview by By Brendan Jamieson](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://www.evaotaku.com/html/evafaq.html):

 **Q) Are the TV ending and Film ending the same conclusion to the saga?**
 
 **A) In my view - No.** (Long explanation follows)
 
 In the TV ending Shinji chose to stay with Complementation - it isn't even clear that Shinji had a choice at all. He is treated as little more than an example of the process of Complementation - which consisted if breaking down Shinji's link to reality. In the end, Shinji looks at the world of Complementation and smiling happily says "I understand! I can exist here !" He is then congratulated for his decision, by friends living and dead (Kaji), a healthy Touji with his leg still on, and even PenPen. A surreal ending scene to say the least. This ending is similar in context and theme to the ending of George Orwell's book, 1984.
 
 Conversely, the film ends in the opposite manner. Shinji does have a choice and in the last moments of the film utterly rejects Complementation precisely because it eliminates the link to reality, it establishes a false paradise. Complementation is basically a cop-out, and Shinji has matured enough to realize this. The tone at the end of the film isn't a surreal, almost drug-induced, joyful "Congratulations!" for Shinji, but the cold and harsh reality of life.
 
 This is a largely unpopular opinion of mine - so let me stress again this is in my view . However, I think the evidence is very much there to support the theory that there are two very different endings to the Evangelion story. But I do acknowledge that there is also persuasive evidence to the contrary. **For the flip side of this theory, check out MDWig's very well-put counter argument.**

<TITLE> Alpha (Shinji) and Lambda (Kaworu) revisited </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-15 23:15:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A year or so ago, [/u/shinjieva2007](http://www.reddit.com/user/shinjieva2007) [*posted a question about this*](http://www.reddit.com/r/evangelion/comments/1dgfi9/alpha_and_lambda_why_those_two_characters_on/), which was mostly dismissed as being incorrect, concluding that the [letters on Shinji's and Kaworu's backs](http://i.imgur.com/GcumVGK.gifv) were upper () and lower () case alpha symbols.

Having recently rewatched the rebuilds, I have to disagree with the previous votes and agree with /u/shinjieva2007 that it is indeed a lambda symbol (), and I would like to bring this question up for discussion again with additional information:

The reasoning to bolster the Lambda arguement is that it is the symbol for a [cosmological constant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant).  If you look at this in regards to the time-loop/divergence theories, I think this fits well; as it implies that Kaworu is a constant observer in what is happening through the cycles - and goes along with his cryptic remarks in 3.33 that imply things are happening *again*.

The  symbol is used notably in [Einstein's field equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations) describing space-time.

Thoughts? </TEXT>

<TITLE> I *hate* DVD (VobSub) subtitles, so converted all the subtitles from the original series to SubRip .SRT </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-04 08:41:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The title nails it.  I own the multiple versions of the original series as well as EOE.  I absolutely cannot stand blocky DVD subtitles.  So I ripped the subtitles for the original series as well as the directors cut episodes to stand-alone VobSub files.  I then OCR'd them into SRT so that I could play my videos with crisp truetype fonts.  No bullshit, no tagging, no modifications - just straight subtitles.

I also converted the subs for EOE.

The files have been named according to what I can scrape from TheTVDB, and use a convention that should be completely compatible with any home-theater playback software (Plex, XMBC, etc).

If anyone would like a copy of these subtitles, feel free to download them from my MEGA cloud drive:

<TITLE> Shinji staring at fluids on his hands... trope? coincidence? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-22 11:08:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm sure this sounds really weird, but is there any significance to this?  Did I miss something in the series?  Is it a Japanese trope of some sort?  And what I mean is the symbolism of staring at fluids on ones hands (not specifically if he jerked it or whatever).

Correct me if I'm wrong, there are two visually similar scenes where Shinji is staring at fluid on his hands and having a traumatic/awakening experience.  [One scene is Rei's blood](http://oi51.tinypic.com/23h4vvr.jpg) leading to his decision to pilot Eva-01, and of course the other is [him jerking it](http://i74.photobucket.com/albums/i267/sailorstardust/NGE25Shinji01.jpg) while hovering over a comatose Asuka.

I was recently rewatching the series, and the scene with Rei's blood immediately made me think of the scene in EOE (which never occurred to me before).  Both sets of fluid-drops on the left-hand hand...   IIRC, there is also a scene where he was staring at his burnt right-hand.  Not looking at fluid on it, but staring at it nonetheless. 

I think I'm getting really bored waiting for 4.0... </TEXT>

<TITLE> AB's restore is broken on old and new app. Reddit mobile support knows, apparently doesn't care. Details: </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-17 22:33:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For anyone else looking for assistance to restore purchases for either the blue (old) or white (new) versions: It's not gonna happen.  Below is an official support reply regarding failed "Pro" restores of both products that described the problem as a failure with Apple's payment system. I don't accept this excuse, as I don't have this problem restoring any other purchases in any other apps.  So if its broken with AB, then its the fault of the programmers of AB.  Yet, here I am holding my ~~di\*\*~~wallet.

 Unfortunately, since we acquired Alien Blue and released it as a new app, your old pro purchase on the old app will not transfer over.
 
 There was an in-app announcement about the acquisition and a week of free pro. We also did a day of free pro on Cyber Monday (again, with an in-app announcement). We have no way of transferring verified pro purchases that occurred in the old AB app because all transactions on iOS are handled by Apple using Apple IDs, and that information is not shared with us (even if you gave us your Apple ID we have no records to compare it with, and also no way of giving you a free purchase since we have no access to Apple's payment system).
 
 If we had a better way, we would have done it, because this is not a good experience for our users. We are really sorry for any confusion! 
 Hope this answers your question.

**For the record:**  I purchased the original Alien Blue (blue icon), as well as upgraded the new Alien Blue (white icon) for free during the free-upgrade period - and apparently, AB will not honor either previous in-app purchase. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Options for non-transcoding Plex clients? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-06 17:53:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Over in /r/cordcutters, theres always a heavy argument against against smart TVs, and I understand some of the rightful points.  But, one thing I really appreciate about my smart TV is that my plex client app can direct play videos, and not require streaming/transcoding.  This is great, as it is a viewing device that puts very little load on my Plex server.

Besides PCs and smart TVs, which other DMPs that can direct play? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Tablo "contest" questions and this subredddit </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-03 03:19:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For /u/LukeBK or /u/KarmaLuke, and the moderators of this subreddit:

***First:***

I had the top comment complaining about the original "contest" thread.  I'm surprised that your account got banned. To openly disclose my own position: I didn't downvote or register any formal complaints myself; I only wanted to express my issue with the fairness of the contest to the readers of this subreddit.  But now that I see how this has turned out, I'm a bit confused as to what happened.  *I hope you get your original account reinstated - following an open disclosure to the following questions below.* 

***Questions:***

I'm disappointed that you have edited your original post, instead of adding addendums to the bottom of it with updated information.  With that, there are a number of questions that I feel need proper addressing before myself and perhaps others in this subreddit can have any faith in what is going on here.

1. You promoted this "contest" in other subreddits, pointing back to /r/cordcutters. You may not realize this, but it gave the appearance of an official /r/cordcutters contest.  I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt on that one.  *Who on the moderation team of /r/cordcutters did you contact to notify of, or preferably get permission to advocate a contest?*

2. *How did you acquire the original Tablo for this contest?  Was it given to you with the purpose of and or the permission to re-sell/re-gift?*

3. *Do you have any direct or indirect connection to anyone at Tablo or Nuvyyo, for the marketing/selling/distribution of their products?*

4. Lets be honest: Turning this into a facebook contest was sketchy, when many are aware of facebook as a marketing and data-collection platform.  *Why did you choose facebook as a platform for a simple name-in-hat selection process?*

5. You say you are sorry for everything, and that to make up for the kerfuffle you are giving away another Tablo out-of-pocket to "make things right" for people with messy media setups of the original giveaway criteria.  An innocent mistake can easily be forgiven, and I'm not trying to accuse you of anything, but this is behavior is somewhat suspect. *If everyone got a fair entry into the facebook "like" contest, why are you giving away equipment if you have no stake in something else going on here?*  

Thank you for your time and honesty. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I purchased the original Alien Blue app, and I also upgraded early for free the Reddit placement app to the "pro" version.  I cannot get either app to restore my purchase after a reinstall.  

The problem presented itself when I switched iPhones without the ability to perform a backup/restore.  There appears to be some sort of glitch when it tried to contact the iTunes server.

 *Connecting to iTunes. Please wait...*

If I logout, I see all the appropriate subreddit flair.  If I login, I don't see any link flair spans that should include class="linkflairlabel".

When I compare the source html: When I am logged in, there are span classes completely missing that would display the required CSS for link flair.  However, these classes are present in the source HTML when I am logged out.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

edit: **This is solved**. "Show link flair" in the reddit settings somehow got disabled. **Thank you everyone who looked at this**. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My observations so far (tested on Roku 2 XS, Win7, OSX 10.10, wired and wireless g n) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-11 02:00:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 1. Currently, none of the channels are in Full-HD (1080p).  The highest resolution observed was standard HD (720p). Some channels are below the HD threshold (e.g. El Rey).
2. 802.11g wifi works with a strong signal, but is noticeably the worst experience I tested.  The interface is the slowest, with thumbnails and data-loading taking the longest.  As expected, upscaling from the initial SD stream up to HD takes the longest over 802.11g. Its annoying.
3. Shows and commercials are separate streams and suffer from buffering and quality up-scaling just like when a channel initially loads.  This quality re-buffering is exacerbated with slower poorer quality connections and slower devices, as expected.
4. The interface speed difference between my Roku 2 XS and my PC/MAC is very noticeable.  The Roku performance for the Sling TV app is quite poor overall.  I realize the Roku 2 XS is slightly dated, but I think this is the worst performing app I have run on it.  Its horribly sluggish when changing channels and when trying to FF/RW on-demand programming. I had not considered a need to upgrade it until now.
5. If using a TV for your display, and if your TV supports it, your viewing experience can be drastically improved by turning up settings that govern Digital and MPEG Noise Reduction.  Motion interpolation settings (e.g. Clear/Auto Motion on Samsung) can further clarify the image to make it look sharper more "cable-quality like".  Stock TV settings, IMO leave the video looking like they are YouTube videos with low bitrates.  There is something about it that screams internet streaming video, especially when watching on a 60" TV.  Naturally, its not as obvious an issue on smaller screens.  The TV noise and motion settings can counteract the current bit-rate quality issues until hopefully the overall service quality is upgraded.  With slightly modified settings TV settings, the image quality was in my and my SO's opinion drastically improved.

HTH - feel free to AMA and I'll try to answer or test as best as I can. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Like a Roku with built-in DVR support, or something similar?  With the recent introduction of Sling TV, I'm interested in a DVR device (or similar solution) that can support recording shows for later viewing.

But it seems that in taking this cut-cord approach, I'm having total recall of VCR use in the 80's: With having to have the TV on, and on the correct channel independently, while the VCR is time programmed to record whatever happens to be active on the TV.

<TITLE> Got bored: Created an 2.5in. x 5in. antenna from stripped coax in the shape of a figure-8. Works great! Thoughts? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-23 13:37:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This evening I took a ~24in. length of left-over coax and decided to create a small antenna for my bedroom TV that previously has just been used for my Roku over wi-fi.  I didn't use any formal guides for making a DIY antenna.  I dont have any particular reason for going with the antenna shape that I did, other than I wanted it to be compact and not rely on a rig of some sort to be attached to. I just stripped the wire, and came up with a shape to try based on whatever I could recall from electrical and electronics courses I took 20 years ago.

Most of the stations I am interested in came in great. I was shocked.  Broadcast location is 21.5mi. away on a mountain top. Not pure line-of-site, but am facing that direction.

Pictures with additional descriptions:  [http://imgur.com/a/NE3oU](http://imgur.com/a/NE3oU)

As shown, this antenna is strapped to the back of the TV and sits about 6 inches from the far-right edge of a window.  The window has blinds and a shade in front of it as well.  But, the window (and subsequently the antenna) do face the direction of the TV broadcast sources - although not open LOS.

Am I crazy?  Lucky?  Should I try a larger configuration?

<TEXT> I'm a recent convert from the world of XBMC - so please bear with some assumptions I may make below.  I really like Plex and am grateful for what the community has done with it.  I'm just trying to get through some learning and adaptation issues:

My current obstacle is dealing with the apparent low quality scraped images that Plex is keyed into (even the images for menu items: Movies, Television, etc).  I'm not seeing 1080 quality anywhere - even in the menu system background images (ala viewing via Samsung TV). The web interface doesn't highlight this lack of image quality so much, since the backgrounds are behind an (presumably 50% opaque?) image curtain that flattens/dulls the image.  But I can still see (via page inspection) that none of these images are actually 1080.

I thought Plex was pulling images from similar/same resources as XBMC, but this doesn't seem to be the case in terms of quality.  Id rather not allow it to download anything below a certain threshold, which would allow me to more easily identify and download the images manually.

Since Plex does not allow easy local access to the cached artwork for direct modification, any ideas, pointers, caveats would be greatly appreciated. 

Please dont take my current annoyance as any type of disparity against Plex. I know its based on XBMC, but I do also realize its a completely different animal that I have to accept and get some things out of my mind about it. :-) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Excited to check it out since its re-opening, and figuring they have all the kinks worked out by now; me and the SO went to Tom's this evening.  It was disappointing. :-(

The food was OK, but not as good as either of us remembered it.  We both got the staple fish and chips, but were not pleased by the end of the meal.  The fish is a different style cut, and the batter just didn't seem the same.   Also, the chips (really skinny fries), while tasting quite good to start-off, turned out to be overly salty.

The special Mexican-Monday menu was a bit off-putting.  Dont get me wrong, I like Mexican food - but I went to an Irish pub to get, food/drink specific to an Irish pub.  Thankfully, fish and chips are always on the menu regardless.

edit for clarity:  The menu is 90%+ mexican food on Monday's only.  Its a swapped-out special menu. </TEXT>

<TITLE> iTunes improperly trimming album covers </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-06 20:23:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have tried looking for a solution to this, but cannot find one - but maybe someone here is familiar with the issue: *iTunes is improperly trimming the displayed cover for albums* that have, for what I call "soft borders" - meaning a lot of empty (any color) space around the boarder, or even if the text is simply soft in appearance.

Examples:

Thanks for any advice!  I figure I will have to edit the covers in question and test adding "hard pixels to the corners" in hopes that iTunes won't trim them...

<TITLE> What is reddit? Reddit 101 FAQ </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-29 05:52:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> ## What is reddit, really?  

* Don't think of reddit as one giant community. This site is made up of "sub"reddits, which are all their own communities. Every single post you see on this site belongs to its own community, with its own set of users, and with its own set of rules. reddit provides you an easy-to-use interface for managing what posts you see by letting you subscribe or unsubscribe from certain subreddits.  

* By making an account, you are automatically subscribed to a set of ["default" subreddits](http://i.imgur.com/4PxSX4e.png) which are a set of highly popular communities that the administrators of this site feel would give the average person an interesting first experience.  

* Don't like one or more of these default subreddits? Use the "unsubscribe" button on the sidebar, and start customizing your reddit front page! Find subreddits that interest *you*. Many subreddits feature lists of "similar subreddits" that will help you find other awesome places to subscribe to. Looking for a subreddit but you just don't know its name? Try /r/findareddit! Finally, try setting up a [multi-reddit](http://www.redditblog.com/2013/06/browse-future-of-reddit-re-introducing.html) to categorize your subreddit list even further! 

---  

## Tips for your account.  

* [See and change your preferences.](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/) Customize how many [comments](http://i.imgur.com/ZDka3tA.png) show up, what kind of [posts](http://i.imgur.com/FqnC5e2.png) show up, [and more](http://i.imgur.com/vFrZ1C9.png)!  

* [Verify your e-mail.](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/update/) If you don't do this and you lose your password, you will have no way to log back onto that account. Ever. Please do this!  

* Karma is a point system that lets you know how your submissions or comments are doing. The more karma your post has, the more people have upvoted it. Generally a higher karma count on a post means that the community of that subreddit found your post valuable and interesting. Your karma is logged on your user page on the top right. **Please note that self-posts earn you no karma.** Only comments and link-posts do.

## What is the sidebar?  

* The ["sidebar"](http://i.imgur.com/OVtMd4K.png) is the list of information pertaining to a specific subreddit. At the top you will find a link to submit a post and a link to search the subreddit. It also contains the link to "subscribe/unsubscribe" from that subreddit. Underneath that it generally lists the rules, guidelines, relevant information, similar subreddits, etc.  

    **Note:** many mobile reddit apps require you to press a certain button for the sidebar to show up. Every subreddit has a sidebar. Please don't forget to look for it even if your app doesn't immediately show it! [Here's an image showing where to find it on common reddit apps.](http://imgur.com/a/kgwuy#0)

* You should always read the sidebar before submitting a post to any subreddit, and if you don't understand a rule message the moderators to ask. This ensures that your post stays on the subreddit, as rule-breaking posts will likely be removed.

* Have a question about a submission to a particular subreddit? Ask the moderators there! [Here's an image](http://i.imgur.com/asq0ZhO.png) that shows you where you can typically find the link to message the mods.  

---

## Who are moderators? What do they do?  

* Each subreddit is a community with its own focus. The mods are volunteers who ensure the subreddit stays true to its purpose by enforcing set rules. For example, /r/android is a subreddit dedicated to discussion of the Android operating system. Anything not directly related to Android is removed by its moderators. Similarly, /r/apple is a subreddit dedicated to discussing Apple and its products.  

* Moderators have the power to approve or remove any comments or submissions made to *only the subreddits they moderate.* They can also issue a ban for users on their subreddit. Moderators enforce the rules laid out in the sidebar, so if you follow all the rules in the sidebar you should be good!  

## Who are admins? What do they do?  

* [Meet the admins.](http://www.reddit.com/about/team) The admins are like super-moderators. They have all the abilities of moderators across every subreddit plus more. They are paid employees of the site and they ensure that the site runs smoothly for all users.

* The admins are generally hands-off when it comes to individual subreddits, letting the moderators and the community decide how its run. **However,** the admins will enforce the [rules of reddit](http://www.reddit.com/rules) on every subreddit. Be familiar with these rules. Failure to follow these rules may earn you a **sitewide ban**, or the closing down of a subreddit.  

---

## What is reddiquette?  

* [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) is an **informal** set of guidelines to follow before commenting or submitting on reddit. As reddit has grown, certain behaviors have been frowned upon and other behaviors have been encouraged. reddiquette spells out these behaviors so you aren't left wondering why your posts aren't well-received. You might not be banned not following reddiquette, but you will probably be showered in downvotes if you don't.  

---  

## Help! What happened to my post?  

* reddit is a huge forum with millions of users. Many posts are made here every day. Many, many posts are made with the intention to spam or harass other users. Other posts just don't fit the subreddit. Moderators have to filter through these posts every day to ensure their subreddit stays on topic and free of hostility. Some moderators use bots to help them report posts, some moderators do it all themselves. Every subreddit is different. If you find your post not showing up in the subreddit, your best bet is to ask the moderators there why it's not showing up. *Please note: when you message the moderators, ALL moderators can read it! It's a shared inbox!*  

    * *I can still see my post but others say they can't?*  
    Nothing is really removed from reddit, if a mod removes something it is de-listed for others to see. You can still see it with a direct link.  

    * *My post was removed because it was spam? What gives?*
    Spam is a tricky subject, reddit has several base rules but much of it is left for moderators to decide. reddit's [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq) has a good section explaining it.

---  

## I have a great idea for an existing subreddit!

* Awesome! [Message the moderators](http://i.imgur.com/asq0ZhO.png) so you can talk to them  

## I have a great idea for reddit as a site!

* Awesome too! Post it in /r/ideasfortheadmins  

## What if I don't like the moderators or how the subreddit is run?  

* That's okay, reddit was built to handle just that! First though, make sure that you talk to the moderators of that subreddit just to be sure there aren't any misunderstandings, or if you can't just compromise. Otherwise, make your own community! [Here is an excellent guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/creesch/wiki/mod101) for starting and moderating your own subreddit.  

* Moderators are people, too, so if you want your voice heard consider messaging them politely with your concerns. We care about the communities we help run and would hate to see users leave because of something that we can help fix!  


---

## What if I need help with something else?  

* Try /r/help for general help on reddit. /r/askmoderators can also help you out if you need to ask mods about anything.  

## I think I found a bug.

* Uh oh. If you are using an application or extension, most have a subreddit you can post in! (/r/RESIssues, /r/alienblue, /r/redditisfun). If you found a bug with reddit itself, post it to /r/bugs (more serious issues should be sent directly to the reddit security team: see the /r/bugs sidebar for contact information.)  


##Other Subreddits of Note

* Other good subreddits to check out for help with various topics are /r/Modhelp, /r/Modnews, /r/ChangeLog, /r/Blog, and /r/Announcements.

<TEXT> I recently rewatched D R, and reviewed that in the final moments of GNR, her neck gets sliced and splatters a stream of blood across part of the surface of the moon.  In D R, this shown starting at time-code [1:15:56].

Is this not the same streak of blood we see in the Rebuilds - supporting the theory that they are a sequel of events? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Throughout the shows, we have seen the candidates/children as well as the EVA's numbered.  I recently noticed by the end of Rebuild 3, that some of the candidates also have Greek alphabet designations on the backs of their uniforms.

1. Shinji:  (alpha symbol on his back), meaning first, or in astronomy the brightest
2. ? I didn't notice who had beta.
3. Asuka:  (gamma symbol on her back), meaning third, or in astronomy the third brightest

In terms of "order", this contradicts who is 1st candidate/child, 3rd candidate/child, and so on.  Anyone else notice this or have any thoughts on it?

<TITLE> Notes on Pangu "dump caches failed" (aka red question marks) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-29 09:25:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Problem:

* Apparently Pangu doesn't like something in your iPhone profile and can't continue the Jailbreak - even though the Pangu app has been injected on your phone.  Try as many times as you want, but its never getting passed "dump caches failed" (red question marks with the progress meter at stopped 10~20%).

Solution:

1. Perform a "Clean Recovery" and create a new iPhone profile
2. Retry Pangu per instructions
3. ...
4. Profit!

HTH.  I tried everything else recommended in this subreddit, and online forums.  As soon as I tried with a fresh profile, it worked perfectly. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I'm aghast with the utter disregard that many Angelenos seem to have for emergency vehicles </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-27 07:01:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Today, case-in-point, two emergency vehicles are going north San Vincente in the 55 zone.  My traffic group is coming to a stop at Stocker St with the emergency vehicles approaching from behind.  I can see and hear them approaching.  I'm in the center lane at the head of the line, but I leave room in front of my car so I can let the guy in the front left lane pull to the right to let the emergency vehicles through.

He doesnt do it.

I yell to him in his car, trying to get his attention over the fact that he's listening to headphones.  He finally takes them off, takes a moment to open and start eating a Redvine, listens twice more to what I have been repeatedly trying to tell him - and then he tells me to "calm down."

I tell him, "dude, I left you space in front of my car so you can get out of the way!"  Meanwhile, there are other people in my lane pleading with other cars in the left lane behind me to move out of the way of the emergency vehicles.  He stares at me and will not move until all the other cars behind him have moved - wasting precious minutes for the emergency vehicles.

What the fuck is wrong with people? </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. No mentions of anything AoS-related
2. There are the standard (2) tags after the movie: serious/continuity-related mid-credits, and a fan service one post-credits. 
3. I highly recommend AoS fans see this movie in continuity order.

Feel free to AMA, provided you use spoiler tags where applicable.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Some random thoughts on the name Skye </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-03-22 05:36:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 1. anagram of the word "keys".
1. anagram of the word "syke", and is a common misspelling of "psych" in English. In Finnish is means "pulse" or "heartbeat". 
1. a fancy way of writing "sky".
1. "Sky" in Italian is "Cielo", which can sound similar to "cello" when when spoken. (I'm not implying anything here - it just sounds similar to me)

Personally, I'm a fan of #1 since she is so adept at getting into computer systems.

<TITLE> [Theory] Clairvoyant - a person, technology, or hybrid? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-03-19 16:19:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [In a reply to comments on another thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/shield/comments/20rebg/new_clairvoyant_theory_may_contain_spoilers/cg6ir2s), I started to self-analyze background opinions I have been having since the T.A.H.I.T.I. episode, which have lead me to a branch of the original theory.

I came to the theory that Nick Fury left documentation clues about the location of Coulson's operation and the Guest House that specifically required a human interaction/element to decipher.  It wasn't anything that could be data-scraped/deciphered in a programmatic way. It required holographic projection and visual analysis of an image.  To oversimplify, this to me seems similar to a [CAPTCHA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA) to inhibit programmatic automation from scraping the data.

So to summarize, The Clairvoyant couldn't see information about Coulson's operation past what would require human interaction and perception.

Following this theory, it makes me lean toward a technologically-based intelligence being at the root of the big bad.

Thoughts?
