<TEXT> Guys, I'm trying to send him some money to help with his backruptcy by listening to him on Spotify. Maybe if we all decide to blast his beats, we can unbankrupt him. We can do this Reddit!

<TEXT> If I didn't get all the electronics, I'd discovered plying the timelines - or if the anti-intellectual crusade was anything less than thorough in how many laboratories it burned - then the **next self-improving AI** would be born in just twenty years

<TEXT> You should get more characters to increase the number of possible combinations. That's where the fun of the game. You can send your low level chars to higher level dungeons with your main chars to power level. 

I do really like b) though. Since the end game dungeon can only be run once per character, it would be useful to have something that helps with levelling new recruits. </TEXT>
