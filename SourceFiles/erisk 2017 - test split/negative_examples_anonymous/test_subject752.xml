<TEXT> * Check your tyre pressure - Most tyres run 32 PSI. You can run higher (I run mine at 38 PSI) but you will get a bumpier ride.
You can normally find your tyre pressure by the Drivers side door latch. (When you open the door, look at the latch mechanism beside your hip and there may be a sticker denoting your PSI/KPI levels)

* If you're driving in a straight line, and you let go of the wheel, does the car noticeable lurch/start to turn itself to either the left/right in a very noticeable way? Then your wheel alignment is out, and this will be causing uneven wear on your tyres.

* If you don't want to fork out around 70-100 dollars for a wheel alignment, then you can put it off by rotating your tyres - from front right to rear left, front left to rear right and vice versa. (Note: ensure the direction arrows on the sidewall are adhered to!)

* Buy fuel when it's as cold as possible, (first thing in the day, or at night.) fuel expands as it gets hot, as as you pump per litre rather than weight you can save *maybe a litre* over a tank just by topping up during the coldest point of the day.

* 91 vs 95/98* honestly 99% of the time you're not going to notice the difference. I've found on a long journey at 100km/h then I did get an extra 50km from 98 (over a 650km tank) compared to 91 with a 2005 Toyota Caldina. But that advantage would quickly be pissed away as around town the vast majority of your energy is accelerating, in which case the difference isn't so pronounced. Therefore if you're looking save cash 95/98 isn't going to help you!

*I think this question alone sparked the phrase "YMMV" (Your Mileage May Vary) lol. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's extremely complicated.

You've got a variety of market forces and different brackets at play which makes for a clusterfuck of opinions.

In one corner you've got the folk who own property in the hot spots, and are watching their investment grow an enviable $1000's of dollars a month.

In another corner you've got the simple fact that people of asian descent dominate our property auctions. 

And another coincidence is this perception is further amplified by the "top sales people" in most realtors again of Asian descent. After 4 years in retail I can say without an iota of racism that Asians buy almost exclusively from Asian salespeople. I've had customer's who walk up to the nearest asian looking sales person and exclusively buy from them. If there were none available, **they would actually have the balls to ask if there were any asian sales people and leave if there weren't!!**.

You've got the devout labour supporters who are simply following the leader by crying foul with the latest stats simply because they have an interest in getting rid of National and supporting Labour.

You've got National Supporters who again are just crying foul because the allegations came from Labour and are loving the racist card in all of this, which is course a giant side show and detracting from Labour's primary message of "Foreign home Ownership" rather than just a good old Chinese bash-up like National are desperately trying to depict.

You've got Labour themselves who are trying desperately to stay relevant in the facing of falling poll results and are willing to post ANYTHING controversial to try and sway the voters by posting potentially defamatory statements against Asians by pigeon-holing people by their last names in an attempt to pull on the public's very hot topic of house prices (Obviously not who are in the first category of watching their investment grow however)

And you've got the young and old or homeless/renters who are rapidly coming to the realisation that no matter what their dream of owning a home is being dashed. 
Whether or not they believe it due to foreign home ownership they just know the National Bank are very very very happily fucking them over with a deep heated coated broom handle by instating LVR resrictions, despite the fact I'd bet my left nut the Banksknow damn well it's the overseas buyers an speculators who are driving up houses prices, but they that's ok because the Bank are still making money hand over fist!

The Government knows damn well there's a problem with speculators and developers (hence the half hearted attempt at a capital gains tax they implemented earlier this year.) however their unwillingness to even look at a register of foreign home buyers should actually show you how desperate they are for the truth not to come out - that our country is very much up for the highest bidder, and the cashed up people are buying up WORLD WIDE and this is affecting the Kiwi's ability to buy a house.

All in all, there's a fucking massive problem, our government are burying their head in the same, our young are being fucked hard with the rising cost of living, coupled with a government who don't give a fuck about keeping jobs on shore, and parents who constantly try and apply their own morals to their offspring without either giving a fuck, or honestly believe it's possible to own your home on your average wage by the time you're 30.

You get a higher education to show employers that you're head and shoulders above your peers and have shown enough interest to get off your ass and learn more about your chosen profession. 

If your employers (like this one) doesn't respect that, move on to the next one. 

It's unprofessional of Employers to bitch about paying people a decent wage and then complain there's no one they can hire who's willing to work for a pittance. It's very hypocritical. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This coming from the softcock (who will ~~probably~~ hopefully read this.) who [blamed NZ internet](http://www.stuff.co.nz/technology/games/68677940/game-developer-dean-hall-says-new-zealand-broadband-in-the-dark-age) on the inability to run a company in NZ. It's like seriously? You think you're the ONLY NZ company to have this same problem, so you go running to the media and actually **threatening** to take the work overseas. 

And now the cunt actually has the balls to try and hire immigrant anyway!?


He's just an outspoken asshole who's apparently looking to bag NZ in any way shape or form he can!?

**You can't refuse to pay market rates to our budding game developers, and then complain there are no game developers. You fucking hypocritical douche bag.**

Dude, GROW THE FUCK UP. Stop running to the media with your problems, if you have a problem with NZ stop being an asshole, blaming everything you can and threatening to take the jobs overseas. Honestly we're better off without you.

* [For the record with a student loan](http://www.salaries.co.nz/a/salary-tax-calculator/) $35,000 is $27,437 pa cash in hand.
* [Average Rent in Dunedin](http://www.enz.org/house-rents-dunedin.html) 350pw is 18,200 pa.
* Weekly grocery shop (Roughly): 100pw is 5200 pa.
* Weekly power (This is Dunedin, so this is an underestimate!): 50pw 2600 pa.
* Weekly petrol in a very cheap car: 35pw is 1820 pa.

**And you get $-383.. Without insurance, internet, landline or cellphone bills**


 So either that's not a 'living wage' or you will at the least be barely scraping the barrel to survive off that salary! That's not a reasonable wage for someone (who's doing skilled work even breaking into the industry), and it's hardly surprising that he's not able to get any staff! </TEXT>

The corporation, which has produced more than a $1 profit for the government for every $1 invested, was assessing $500 million in finance for solar projects valued at more than $1 billion.
There are 1.3 million rooftop solar systems in Australia and most households receive publicly-backed rebates to install, but the CEFC has made a priority projects that help people who do not own their own homes, those who live in apartments and community groups to invest in solar"

It's pathetic, we're literally prisoners in our own economy. I don't give a flying fuck if those old fucks are making mega dollars on their 2000 they bought back in 1967 cause realistically that doesn't go into the fucking economy, it goes back to some private property investor fat cat who currently doesn't pay tax on that income. So tell me more how it benefits me (a 28yo male)? It doesn't! 

Fuck the foreign buyers, especially fuck the banks for being greedy cunts, causing the property crisis by loaning money to people who couldn't pay it back (you know the middle class who haven't had a pay rise in years, while ceo's and other fat cats line their pockets with the proceeds of the effort of these people but I digress), then further fucking over the middle class by allowing foreign buyers preference over first home buyers with their LVR restrictions, and I'm just waiting till the government blames first home buyers on the prices flying upwards, just wait it will happen! It already has over in Australia!

It was only 1 guy complaining from presumably quite a large list of people he invited.

The ultimate question is did he really have to cancel an entire sponsored dinner (probably at great cost to the booking fee etc) over 1 sour man accusing him of being cohorts with the company who won the contract over him? 

Or did the guy make him realise it actually maybe wasn't a good look, and could appear as a conflict of interest, so cancelled it, while blaming the guy as a scapegoat? 

I'm leaning towards the latter, judging by his outburst flying off at the guy about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry, I should explain! They charged the restocking fee on a mate who bought from them, a Maximum VII Hero, and a Samsung M.2 SSD. the Maximus doesn't accept SATA M.2's (not that you could tell from the specs!) and so he had to return it, and they demanded a 35% cut of a $300 dollar item, and he swapped it out with a SATA SSD.

He should have argued it, as really he bought every other component from them as he told the retailer his purpose (by having every single component for a PC in his cart) that he was building a PC and that the HDD he had selected was not compatible with that motherboard. Therefore the item was not fit for purpose.

It's a bit of a gray area, but I reckon he should have argued they didn't warn him when boxing the components, or even have it explicitly state that while the motherboard has an M.2 slot it does not accept SATA based M.2 drives, only PCIe based M.2 drives. (Confused yet?)

However he didn't argue and just took the $100 whack to his wallet! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see what you're saying, but to a layman you're setting yourselves up to fail when you continually award every single large project to the same company.

No company is beyond corruption as the Public found out about [Projenz](https://www.sfo.govt.nz/n494,27.html) not so gracefully last year. And no company is too big to fail either, which would leave Chch people extremely in the lurch as most of the work going on is with the same company. That to me just doesn't make sense.

However (to me anyway) the whole point of tender is to ensure the work is done by the ~~best~~cheapest not whoever's the biggest. 

Just saying they got it because they have no competition is a bit silly as you're kinda resigning the industry to ensuring they're their own worst enemy by continually giving work to one company on the basis of well they are the biggest.. 

However above all he's a Politician for goodness sake, and grown man who should be able to stick by his decisions.

Furthermore, had he not cancelled it, this more than likely would have been a non-event. However, by cancelling the event, after having invited journalists he knew very well (or his PR team should have told him..) that this was going to get more scrutiny than warranted.

The accusations being thrown at him by someone who lost an extremely lucrative contract so of course they are going to be pissed about it, and say stupid things. However he really didn't need to respond like this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, you're right, but it's not much the lack of support from the businesses, bear in mind 99% of them don't own the land, rather lease it. And those who lease it only buy what's available.

This needs to be addressed with a building code change - for X amount of people the building can hold, Y% must be available for parking.

However as I've pointed out before, what sounds better? 

"For Sale $1M Office building fits 500 staff, 300 car parks."
"For Sale $1.3M Office building fits 900 staff."

The latter of course, therefore in order to get as much profit from their developments they don't want a minimum carpark allowance, therefore as developers are well and truely one of the biggest campaign boosters this will not happen.

So long story short, council is being an ass. Developers force the problem to the council. And the little guy loses. Once again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Very muchly, I agree WLG were gimped from the start, but having spent a week there recently they aren't doing too badly with what they've got.

On the other hand, getting from Riccarton Avenue for instance to the carpark beside the bus Exchange, you have to go through about 5 set of lights, and cross at least 3 lanes of traffic (at a time.) which is nearly impossible for someone who doesn't 100% know where they're going. Which is stupid, road's should be intuititive and easy to use.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you! Exactly. They can't just tout a lower reduced tolerance as a crash reduction parameter, while it may be a factor, it's one of many in regards to whether people crash. 

I get it, speeding past a school = dangerous.
Speeding (~110) on the open road when in a passing lane = acceptable behaviour

However while they do they do the occasional blitz outside schools, I've personally only seen a speed camera van down fendalton road on a monthly basis. Never once have I seen a police presence outside Burnside highschool, despite the fact I drive past daily when parents are dropping their kids off.

<TEXT> I agree, but cars and drivers don't/can't just slam on the brakes to go the posted sign limit if the system thinks that now's a good time to change it to 60. 

I can only hope there will be a buffer zone - e.g. the system waits a second before pinging people for speed, as people who go past it right as it changes from 60-40 but have no hope of physically seeing the sign change.

I know it's a rare situation, but there's a lot of potential for abuse from the operators to change the speed and ping people immediately. </TEXT>

I know I probably would have failed School cert, I certainly failed NCEA.

I know I'm not a fucking idiot as I'm not doing too badly in the game of life, but to fail and have beside the failure "Did not achieve" was insulting to say the least. 

I mean look at HTC for what happens everyone keeps telling them: "You tried your best, and that's ok" in relation to the M8. 
then they think mediocrity is acceptable, and release the M9. Then everyone blasts them for not being creative enough to produce a new device.

Does that make sense?  </TEXT>

**Para 3.:**
Lisa Finlay, Bronwyn Hayward, Leanne Hermosilla, Josh Hetherington, Rob Stowell, Jasmine Taylor, Giovanni Tiso, Daniel Webster and Julia Woodhall complained that the article breached several Press Council principles.

<TEXT> No, they give you 15 minutes lee-way at the beginning of the fire process.

After 15 minutes, with most techniques you should have significant combustion of the wood.

Incomplete combustion, (and subsequently waste of wood) results in soot (carbon) in the atmosphere.

So if you have a good fire from kindling, and whack a log that's too big, or wet or contaminated for complete combustion to occur you get smoke/soot. This also causes expensive chimney blockages, and results in less heat being generated. 

So yes it's a pain in the ass, but actually proper techniques, and keep your fire smoke free is significantly better use of your wood, and subsequently cheaper.

<TEXT> I fully understand a bar is a place to socialize, and alcohol is engrained in or socialization culture. 

However going to be the pub, preloaded and buy only 1 beer, you're contributing to the demise of that pub, I don't know what the $$$ per head need to keep a pub open but it just be quite steep, rent doesn't pay itself! 

A few successful pubs like the Fox have a reward scheme, similar to a subcard, which seems to work. Perhaps if they liked further abroad than just jacking prices we may see more of a scene back again. 

That being said they are giving an uphill battle, in Chch it's stupidly hard to get a liquor license to sell anywhere, but this again makes me wonder why more bars don't look beyond jacking up prices to stay alive. It's not easy to run a business, but it's easy to ruin one.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Help needed. Video Trim feature not working properly on 5.0 S5 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-01 04:35:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi /r/GalaxyS5.

Google was no help, so hopefully someone here can shed some light on this issue.

I use phone as a dashcam, and trim a lot of videos.

Recently after upgrading to lollipop when playing back videos in the Trim feature it plays back at 1.3x speed, and doesn't accurately portray the video length you've selected to crop.

I've deleted cache/clear data from "Video Trimmer" App, and disabled, rebooted, reenabled.
I've also cleared data from "Trim" app.

This happens on videos shot from my device, reading from both SD card and internal memory.

Any help or suggestions would be appreciated.

Cheers! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Indeed. I don't know if you recall but a school up north basically gave out Credits for wiping your fucking nose in order to beat the statistics and ensure they got funding! 

I can't find the particular story, [this](http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-star-times/latest-edition/318375/NCEA-battered-by-secret-report) is rather damning..

"THE FIRST major analysis of schools' NCEA marking shows many teachers are awarding better grades than examiners do with high-profile schools among the dozens suspected of marking too high.

This means students who shouldn't have passed NCEA may have. Others might have missed out on university entrance because their school marked tougher than others."

And you **really** wonder why this girl is complaining? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Indeed. I for instance failed miserably at NCEA, and my teachers constantly lamented, saying "why aren't you doing better than this!? I know you're smart, but you fail your exams!" my report is littered with "my name can do better" and I have done better since in the real world - I'm in good employment with a large multinational and earning a very decent wage for my young age.

I'm not saying I'm a special case, but I'm perhaps a bit too atypical  to fit within the NCEA curriculum, and as a result I was frustrated throughout high school as I felt like the exams weren't catered for different learning styles. 

From what I understand there was that leeway under the old school cert that you there were more than one ways to skin a cat, however under NCEA it was just a decision process that was extremely binary and linear. 

Again, fuck you Trevor Mallard (Education Minister at the time) you humongous cunt bag. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can we just realise for a second that most of the old timers here (well, those 28 and older) sat through a far more robust and time honoured teaching system. 

Kids nowadays are sitting through NCEA, a far cry from the old School Cert system.

NCEA isn't about learning at all, it's about gaining credits through an arbitrary system of points that are seemingly granted at whatever discretion some fuck thought was adequate.

There is no 'teaching' just a series of decisions which leads to more credits, or less credits, which are the used to either pass, or fail a course.

NCEA has totally fucked over our learning system, and this is the culmination of 10 years of tweaking a system that should never have survived the first year. 


Fuck you Trevor Mallard you fucked up you cunt.

I walked out of school in disgust back then, and would do it again in a heartbeat.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The law catches people who want to bludge off our extremely (by world standards) lenient benefit laws. This catches both the extreme criminals, and in her case perhaps someone too naive for her own good. Is it fair? Laws aren't designed to be fair, but to allow as many genuine people through while catching those who will be a (perceived) burden on the system. 

It's literally a game of numbers, and if you have more stacked against you, that's it. Fairness completely aside.  </TEXT>

Will it be enabled by Samsung? Probably not because their marketing team are a pack of sanctimonious fucking assholes!! 

They had the opportunity to release it with lollipop, but chose not to. 

Furthermore when you look into Samsung's cunty decision riddled history you can see multiple instances of them being arrogant fucking douchebags and keeping the latest hardware agnostic software tricks to the latest galaxy rendition only, e.g. Themes on the s6. 

So I would not hold your breath. 

I love Samsung products, but fucking despise the piss poor level of after sales software support. 

Then you look at HTC who readily enabled raw to their one lineup.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My 2c:

Advertising isn't fixing that culture, in fact given the freedom of our brewery giants with advertising it's a stark contrast, we have "no more Beersies" coupled with some pretty hard hitting alcohol advertising about partying etc. 

Ultimately you can't trust your customers to know when to stop, and pubs make money from selling you overpriced booze, so there's a conflict of interest there. 

I wish I knew how to address things, but seriously New Zealanders like their booze, and have a deeply engrained drinking culture that's going to take some doing to unwind the recent rise in statistics around drunken assaults, and strain on emergency services from drunken tomfoolery. 

I'm no idiot, there is always going a problem, and old people who make the law tend to have stupidly short memories as to what they did when they were young, and that hypocrisy is adding to the problem.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, so it's let break down his video.

For starters, he's not obeying the law of "keep left" in his own video evidence, at 00:26 he was firmly on the road, when there was the opportunity to ride on the left.

Then his commentary itself reeks of arrogances, let's have a look at his language:

* He said: "They missed a couple of opportunities to "quickly" navigate pass me"

 * For those who don't know the road, it's a very windy, very dangerous road. You have as little as 50cm either side of the white line before you either hit the cliff, or your wheels drop into a 30-90ft drop. You don't "quickly" nip past someone, unless you know the road really well.

* He said: "They **had** to follow me along the next straight"
 * This could easily be construed as "I did not let them pass." Better wording to help his cause would have been: "there were no opportunities for them to pass." we don't know why they "had" to stay behind him, but that sentence by itself doesn't sound very good in this context.

* He then goes on to say as they passed him: "Quite hesitatant, quite slow".."Looked sideways, international tourists"..
 * I cycled for a long time, if you have someone up your ass, you look behind you, **is he honestly telling us this is the first time he actually looked the van?** After all this time, he never actually looked behind him to see if he was holding up traffic, or how close they were? That's appalling driving full stop, you should ways look behind you!
 * Furthermore, this actually **completely** explains their hesitance, they were unfamiliar with the road, they were probably stressed by a growing row of cars behind them, and this guy wasn't budging an inch to let them pass.

All in all, this guy's coming across like a totally arrogant sod, and he did not do himself any good by going to the Press about it. At the very least he should have thought very carefully about what he was going to say, and not used any of the words, or examples he gave as I've proven any reasonable person can rip them apart and make him sound like he's the bad guy!

<TEXT> Woah, one of my more controversial comments. 

* Is it a stupidly implemented plan? Fuck yes.
* Was the news article deliberately worded to illicit maximum racism triggers? Oh you bet your click bait it was.
* Does it help people who need help? Well.. Yes, it does. For **that and that alone** it's a great idea.
* Is it racist? [According to the dictionary](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/racism) it most certainly is a clear cut racist policy: "a policy, system of government, etc., based upon or fostering such a doctrine; discrimination."
* Does it help anyone? No. Ultimately now the cat's out of the bag, I really wouldn't want to be a policeman today! I can image a lot this today: "Oh you're just giving me a ticket cause I'm white?! Fuck you cunt! I read the news about you racist pricks not ticketing Maori! I'm not paying this."  </TEXT>

Maori are proud kiwis, and no-one likes to ask for help, until it's too late. Honestly this is great, it puts those at in financial stress at the doorstep of those who can help.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For the record school uniforms make up a fantastic wee profitable side business.

The school puts out a tender for the lowest bidder to offer their services to design/make/sell the school uniform. The school then takes the cheapest tender, while basically being able to make their own price, and their profit.

They then take a cut of all the sales of said uniforms, while holding it above the students heads that they must wear a uniform.

It's a fucking monopolistic racket. 
If you're interest [this is worth a read.](http://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jan/18/school-uniform-results) It basically confirms "After eight years, Brunsma concluded that: "The results, although surprising to many, simply cannot be ignored. Uniforms do not make our schools better."

So I'm loving all the self righteous "The point of a uniform is to ensure there's equality with the students" comments. Bah! No uniforms are a source of massive profit for schools, and they want to keep it that way! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Further to this - if you don't want to go through the hassle of configuring a new email, you can [use an alias email!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_alias) 

A lot of email companies (ISP's etc) allow you to configure an alias email  to be sent to primary email account. Think of it like a mask for your true address.

For instance, say I have an email: "teherbil@fakecompany.net"
I approach Fakecompany, and ask them to configure a more profressional sounding alias:
"joe.bloggs@fakecompany.net" for my test_subject752 account.

Moving forward, you can put "joe.bloggs@fakecompany.net" in your CV etc, and when your **receive** email it goes to your test_subject752 account.

You can also configure Outlook and using the companies own email interface to **send** from that email account as well, with the reply coming back to test_subject752. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nice! 

the frustrating thing is he'll be haemorrhaging cash with his dirty practices, a sustainable farm that reinvests effluent back into the land, can (after an initial small investment) provide a significant return. But too many farmers (at least when a few years back) are way too ignorant and set in their ways to change.

The sad thing is our environment can't keep up with the current rate of pollution from dairy farming, I was chatting to the guys who run the Waitaki/Ohau canal and dam system. Basically they've been working on the system for 20 years + and it's incredibly disheartening for them recently as the levels of the nitrates in the soil has lead to a significant impact on the quality of the water running through the system. 

It's so bad the colour of the water itself, which used to be a beautiful pale blue color, straight off the main divide is slowly turning brown as it's choked with pollution and weeds which thrive in the nitrogen rich water.

It's got to stop, or at least change significantly, as something has to give. 

It's not just the farmers future at stake, it's our childrens. </TEXT>

Check with your Energy Provider, if you have a smart meter you may be able to get an hourly blow by blow of when the Energy's being used. If it is as you suspect the heatpumps - then it will show up as a huge spike when you turn them on.

Things you can try doing:

* Go to http://www.whatsmynumber.org.nz/ to see if you're on the best plan for your energy needs.
* Anecdotally Powershop are **not** the best value out there.
* Personally I've been happy with [Meridian Energy](https://www.meridianenergy.co.nz/)- they're also offering $150 and a free gift.
* [Genesys are offering a free bill (up to $250)](https://signup.genesisenergy.co.nz/)
* Look at getting a day/night meter installed (typically can cost around $70-90 - this offers you cheap electricity during the night (typically 10-7am) and usual rates during the day.
This  enables you to run things like dishwashers, washing machines, dryers etc during night time (with timers) and on cheaper electricity. *LPT: We also set our heat pump to start at 6.30am so it heats the rooms up during that initial surge useing the cheaper electricity!* </TEXT>

<TEXT> We bought the zero excess for a Wellington 5 day car hire.


The reason being is simple, we couldn't afford it if someone hit us, the insurance sided with them and charged our card. Not likely I know but the extra price was just factored into the car hire budget.

The other benefit I didn't foresee was the car company didn't check the car before we bought it (just off a flight with a 9mo so great to get him to my relatives asap!) 

And likewise when we returned the car, they didn't need to check it, so we didn't need to assign an unknown period of time to have them check the car for damage. (Again tired, shitty sick 9mo!) </TEXT>

It does seem like the price of things are kept off main stream media, for instance Australia called the big companies and gave them a very public blasting for the ridiculous mark up on the price of software and other multinational products, while our media stayed silent on the matter. 

Again, (putting on tin foil hat) the NZ public have been subliminally trained to shut up and put up with whatever prices companies want to shove down our throats. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not trolling, they have a good point. Here's a few recent issues with greed in NZ society:

* The Comcom decision to allow Chorus to charge a stupid amount of money in total disregard for the fact that Chorus have been overcharging consumers for years!

* Air New Zealand and others not decreasing the price of the airfare despite Oil prices dropping signifcantly (and fuel prices as a result) and subsequently the entire Airline industry is in for a record $29.9 BILLION dollar profit!

* Online payment "convenience fees" cropping up when paying online. (E.G. Vodafone when paying your phone bill via their Application)

* Beer prices in most cafe's and bars being $7.50+ at the cheap scale, at $12 for a single Corona etc. (they're $2 from the supermarket.) and then they complain people pre-drink..

* Schools forcing parents to buy clothes/stationery from 1 retailer, usually at a stupendous mark up, of which the school then gets a cut from.

* Most retailers charging a ridiculous mark up for supporters merchandise. (E.g. the Adidas debacle over the All Black shirt that could be bought for *hundreds* less overseas.

* Kiwi meat prices, we're charged more at our supermarkets than the meat is subsequently for sale for overseas.

Fuck, what else really? We have had the wool pulled over our eyes for many years that "buy kiwi" was best, but in reality we are being groomed to pay the ticket price, never haggle, and don't question status quo. 

As a result, greed has crept into the equation and subsequently the prices have risen steadily out of line with the cost of supply and selling and 99% of the time this profit has been driven back to the shareholders/bosses while the man actually doing the work gets minimum wage and told to shut up and accept it.

<TEXT> But it's never the rich paying for anything, their smart enough to use the loopholes provided by the government's they voted in, like trusts etc. 

It's the working middle class like me (earning just above "average" wage) as the sole bread winner for my family, as I said I pay tax due to not earning enough to either hide, or to bother with hiding. 

I can't get any benefits as it stands, and as you said the increase in retirement age which is going to happen (and they are bumping the superannuation up more than any other benefit) will mean I, and peers my age will be paying even more tax before we can claim anything that's not mean tested, and that's even *if* the superannuation is around by then! 

Hence why "charge the rich" is joke! Direct from Google..

**New Zealand went through a major program of tax reform in the 1980s. The top marginal rate of income tax was reduced from 66% to 33% (changed to 39% in April 2000, 38% in April 2009 and 33% on 1 October 2010) and corporate income tax rate from 48% to 33% (changed to 30% in 2008 and to 28% on 1 October 2010).**

So there's your charge the rich, our government's have no interest in doing so, because the rich because put people in government. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But the thing is it's not sustainable in any way, telling me that the rate of increases to the superannuation when at this rate we'll need to raise the retirement age to 70 in the next couple years is going to help anyone before the age of 50 is a slap in the face. 

For instance due to the income restrictions they place upon any benefits I can get put me out of range despite being on a single income family, with a young baby. We have to dip into savings each month to live. So despite the fact I'm been paying my fair share of taxes which go towards these benefits I can't claim any of them despite needing to. Old people however, some of whom I'm certain never paid taxes due to fantastic accountants are sitting there with taxpayers money rolling in each month without fail. What.The.Fuck? 

Now you look me in the eye and tell me that if they applied same income testing against super that they would still have to keep the came cap on the other benefits? I believe they would have significantly more money in the pot to allow more members of society access to benefits, like myself. 


I'm discriminated against due to my age. My wife and son are discriminated against by having an age based restriction placed against me (and them) as to what benefits we can claim, then further restricting these benefits based upon my income! 

Further more, the bell graph for nz aging population speaks volumes about the future of the New Zealand's increase in the amount of aged people:
http://www.stats.govt.nz/populationpyramid2/NZPopulationPyramid.html

Basically as is clearly visible the amount of old people is set to rise dramatically in the coming years. 

If the current economists are warning that *just* our current superannuation is not able to be sustained, especially at the way national this will become even worse! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not comparing us to other countries, relatively speaking we have had it good. However recently (past few years) it's just gone downhill. 
 
We've got as government that's spending ludicrous amounts of money on a flag referendum, which had no public support at all.

We've got a public service for unemployed that treat their customers like pieces if shit. 

We've got children dying in public housing due to a complete lack of fucks at housing NZ. 

We've got house prices going up $2000 a week and anecdotally a severe speculator and investor issue in regards to people inflating the prices of houses, which they profit from, ~~which then isn't taxed.~~ ^See ^below ^for ^correction

We've got the young walking out uni with stonking student loans and a government which isn't providing any incentives for companies to keep employing NZ staff.

We've got no government party with a meaningful action plan to address climate change. 

We've got families living in garages still in chch thanks to being shafted by their insurance companies, and again a government that couldn't give a Fuck.

 
And we've got a government which refuses to recognize there's a massive fucking rental problem in the major centres and they have an over budget, under delivered housing scheme to supposedly address it.


And that's just what I could think of off the top of my head.

Fucking Wonderful. As if this cuntry (sic) needed another reason for the young to give to two middle fingers to this Godforesaken ageist bullshit old fart lead country who have little issue with burning the ties with the younger generation so the degenerates can sell off this country piece by piece to foreign buyers, reaping in the profits while these total fat cat pricks will sit back on their [parlimentary pension](http://www.nzpensionprotest.com/Home/the-offenders/the-real-double-dipper) while dipping into the pension and whatever other benefits they can get their grubby mitts on while they pay stupendous amounts of money to their accountants to hide the rest of their greed gotten ill gains from selling their property portfolio while they stoke the property market into a frenzy. 

Edit: Fuck our leaders. Just totally over their bullshit. 27 year old, I thought by this stage I would have more of an interest in politics, as I thought it would be more relevant to me. Now I've come to realise how completely out of touch our politicians are, how completely easily and lawfully they can be bought by corporations and other governments, and how there are no government parties that aren't greedy some way shape or form. 

None of them speak for me, none of them speak for the younger generation (18 - 35) and it's incredibly frustrating to hear time after time... Why aren't you doing better?... Why can't you afford a house?... Why don't you have a better job?... Why aren't you earning more?... When in reality those jokes, about "If I had a dollar everytime a babyboomer asked why we can't afford a house then we could probably afford a house with the economy they fucked over. 

My child has no hope of walking away from university without a horrendous student loan, and that's if the government hasn't allowed all the companies to outsource any job worth doing to a foreign country.

Our country is fucked. Our government is fucking it hard, you can't beat a dead horse, but you can rape it. </TEXT>

All it takes is fucking idiot to think the rules don't apply to them, get themselves killed and people are saying shut it down, and kill the animal involved. Why? For being a wild animal? No, just follow the damn rules you stupid knobs.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm running a g900i disabled most onboard apps like Google *everything* (movies, books etc), Samsung *everything*(movies books etc), and an running stock 2 degrees firmware from NZ. 

I do use the dark theme for Reddit Sync, but most of my usage is browsing on opera browser beta.

Anyway, it can be done with little loss of functionality -no Google now or S-voice for instance. 

And this was spent all day without power save mode too. 

So yeah, ymmv but disable stuff if your Rom allows, you will be surprised what crap you run that you never use! </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be fair: "we have to compete against cheap supermarket beer, let's look at reducing our prices" said no beer owner ever. 

You're not the first person to suggest bar owners shouldn't charge so fucking much for a drink, to be fair they're utterly the victims of their own demise, uni students etc just can't afford $15 for a 1.3 standard drink Smirnoff or whatever (and that was prequake prices..) So seriously, instead of changing with the times (more low alcohol beer, more food options, cheaper/better priced alcohol) they just whine, and bitch and complain how the world's against them. 

The other argument I get told is "well there wasn't a reduction in bad behavior when the closing times were changed a while back" and it's like you diving kidding me?

You stupid cunts that should have led to a change in behavior before shit got worse.

<TEXT> Try using sports mode more often. 
If in doubt, use the flash. 
Always turn on your lights in the room (if indoors)

Your device will default to around 1/33 second (a third of a second) to take the lowest possible iso photograph. Sports mode speeds this up to around half a second, which is better than nothing. 
Source of my info: s4 owner for a year, s5 current owner. 

Both have no OIS (optical image stabilization) which means your hand has to stay dead still for around half a second! So you learn to make to do without it. 

If you legitimately have trouble holding your camera still for a third of a second then I would strongly advise you look at OIS for your next device.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So as the header suggests, what would it need to employ a system wide spiral motion to zoom in and out of everything from websites to documents etc. 

I had this functionality on my Nokia N900, it made one handed usage unlike anything else since. 

This would replace/supplement "pinch to zoom" as that inherently requires 2 hands, which (with today's 5 inch plus devices) is not always possible! 

Anyway, any idea how this could be implemented, or is it a pipe dream to every see it back?  </TEXT>

This way he turned a forgettable event "oh, didn't that guy hand in 50 bucks last night?" Into "oh that wanker the other day, yeah he took the money"

Ironically this probably helped the staff recall the event, also ensured other shift workers knew about the money and ensure it got back to the old lady.  </TEXT>

Read up: www.consumeraffairs.govt.nz/for-consumers/law/consumer-guarantees-act

Let them know from the outset what your expectations are, whether it be a new phone, refund or what. You have given then their "chance" to remedy the situation, now it's your turn to say "I want x." 

Follow up, agree on a time frame, ask for the escalation path as to who you should talk to, e.g. 
"if this isn't sorted I a week, please let me know the name of your regional manager or other such person I can escalate this to."

If you get your matter resolved, follow up, thank them for helping you (if they did..).

Do NOT bad them on social media, just keep it offline. If this goes as far as the small claims they will dig dirt on you if they can.  </TEXT>

However swearing at, and making presumptuous comments at people who aren't blaming the media seem at odds with your angry anti media sentiment. 

As proven time after time this kind of violence needs to addressed by very citizens it affects the most, the sons, daughters, husbands and wives if those murdered need to tackle the problem head on, and bring the crime rate down together. The culture of blaming others needs to stop if they're ever to reach a satisfactory outcome (of a more peaceful crime free neighbourhood). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why is that ageist? No benefits for people my age are not means tested, in fact many are stonkingly hard to acquire, and aren't worth it.

For the record, here's the table for the amount of money you get [for being being on the pension](http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/map/deskfile/nz-superannuation-and-veterans-pension-tables/new-zealand-superannuation-and-veterans-pension-ra.html)

We pay more to our old people than we do to a [single parent](http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/map/deskfile/main-benefits-rates/sole-parent-support-current.html)

[Or to people looking for a job.](http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/map/deskfile/main-benefits-rates/jobseeker-support-current.htm)

And if you do work until you're 65, even on a meagre salary you don't get any support at all.

So yes, it's absolutely ageist, we pay our old people regardless of..

* How much they've worked,
* How little they've worked, 
* Whether they're still working, 
* How much money they own or have in the bank, 
* What assets they have, 
* How many dependents they have..
* Whether they're in the country
*Or ANY of the prerequisites required of the younger generations.

So yes, applying no rules for 1 age bracket, and every rule under the sun for every other age bracket is extremely ageist. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Going to unleash a shit storm here, but seriously: Means test superannuation.

No seriously, let's look at the biggest 'arguments' and show why it's a fucking cop-out.


**"They've paid tax their entire life."**

* For starters, this doesn't apply to immigrants.
* Paying tax isn't a fucking retirement nest egg plan, it's called playing life.

**"Why should you punish those who have saved for their retirement?"**

* You're not punishing them, they're punishing the future generation by taking from their future retirement who can't afford it, because you fucked the economy.
* Why? Seriously, they listened, they saved, they were never guaranteed a wee bonus for living a long time.

**Let look at a few facts:**

* **We can't afford to keep paying Superannuation at the current rate.**
* As a 27 year old who's the sole breadwinner for their family the government has decided I can't get any assistance or even the fucking community services card, despite the fact we're barely holding our head above water by eating into savings.
* My generation basically cannot hope to have superannuation. Certainly not at 65, probably not even 70 years old. 

So there, fuck your guaranteed money for being old. I'm sick of this ageist culture. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Indeed. But increasing the price without offering any incentive should be business suicide.

However they made $137M profit 2013, and $165M profit in 2014. and $92.5M profit in the 6 months up til December 2014, so this year is expected again bumper profits.

I'm not saying a company can't make profits, obviously that's ultimately what they're there for. But in the same breath a consumer only has appetite for a certain amount of cost, and Sky are pushing that further and further every year to see how far they can go before it blows up in their face. 

That to me seems like an obscenely arrogant way to push up profit at the cost of losing customers. 

Seems like someone has analyzed the NZ public, and has done the math as to what they think Sky can get away with at each incremental charge increase.

Given their profit's only going up and up in substantial amounts it appears that this is done purely for greed sake, as they haven't released anything recently to justify the price increase..

I don't know, I'm not a business analyst, but I'm not stupid, so I can see why, (Profit) I just think it's wrong. (Greed.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually this makes sense. Here's why:

* Smaller die fabrication could result in less power consumption, thus less heat production, and increased thermal envelope.
* The average useage scenario for most people is short bursts of activity, so having 4x high performance cores that are available for short bursts makes sense for ensuring UI responsiveness, quick camera processing.
* The 2x medium performance cores which are available for sustained constant useage (think gaming etc.)
* And your 4x low power cores for your fitness tracking, background thumbnail and media processing etc.

As the 810 works for short periods, having something use 50milliwatt for 10milliseconds is preferable than something that uses 40milliwatts for 20milliseconds.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually it makes sense, all phones have a thermal envelope to play with. 
Either you can have a 1ghz dual core that can operate at 100% constantly and never hit it..

Or..

You can have a 4ghz Octocore which hits it in 15 seconds.

Now, as you've pointed out, most people don't need their processor working all the time at 100% However most people do want NO LAG, and INSTANTANEOUS response time. This needs immediate grunt on tap.

So where as your dualcore can respond within 150ms at all times
Your Octocore can respond with 10ms for your 15 seconds until you hit your thermal envelope.

Obviously people want a faster response time, over sustained performance, so will go for your Octocore.

Not a lot, the biggest impact will be to farmers.

To your average Jo Bloggs in NZ it will mean bigger more noticable storms, more dry, warm drought ridden spells, coupled with higher winds. (Think Christchurch norwesters.)

To your farmers? It will spell bankruptcy for many, especially dairy farmers, which is typically quite water intensive.

We'll also see produce prices rise, as more foul weather will result in bad crops. </TEXT>

My very rough understanding of the law is take into account all the actions, all the facts, without prejudice or feelings.
Heavily coming into this is it's the child's mother. We wouldn't be having this discussion if it were another relative.

As I keep saying, as far as the law's concerned, this baby was killed by a mothers negligence. 

There's an entirely innocent victim here, and while it's beyond heartbreaking for the mother I feel the weight of the act that was carried out needs to conveyed with a different sentence than discharged without conviction.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going to be downvoted here, but this woman isn't a victim, her child is.

For everyone asking for a discharge without conviction can we at least recognise the severe and extreme pain that poor child would have been in before they died?

The simple fact here is a baby, whose entire existence is dependent upon their family, died due to her mothers inattention. 
Regardless of culpability this victim suffered before she died horribly, and her sentence needs to reflect that.

To allow her to get away with this with a discharge without conviction is not recognising the extreme pain this baby suffered due to her negligence.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let's put it this way:

* You have 2 men, manually flying a 280 ton aircraft.
* They have some 350 souls entirely trusting these 2 men with their lives.

* The pilots always have 1 ear out listening to ground control 
* They have another ear listening other aircraft.
* And another listening for the other pilot.
* They also have are listening for error alerts.
* Both eyes are constantly scanning their instrument panel.
* Both eyes are constantly scanning the horizon to orientate themselves and look for danger
* And they're gripping the yoke tightly with both hands.

Yeah, there's a good reason why being an airline pilot is [rated as one of the worlds most stressful jobs.](http://www.careercast.com/slide/most-stressful-jobs-2015-4-airline-pilot)


And you think you should avoid going to jail for a very long time for attempting to blind them while they're doing all of this? While they're tasking with ensuring mums, dads, sisters, brothers aunts and uncle all can land safely?

<TEXT> Failing to see why it's the staff's responsibility to keep track of a grown man. 

I'm sure the Interislander is damned if it does, and damned if it doesn't. The only way I can see to stop this happening is to ensure you hold a ticket of sorts which is stamped and crossed off vs a passenger list when you leave. (I haven't use the service but presume this isn't happening.) so while they could enact such a measure valid travelers would be severely inconvenienced by this.

And further more, by the time it reaches the destination, chances are (if he disembarked early enough) he'll be swept far out to sea.

I understand the Widow is pissed off and wants to blame someone, but at what point do we have to say shit, there's no point blaming the company as any measures taken to avoid such accidents are just pointless given if someone ultimately wants to kill themselves they will circumnavigate any measures put in place. </TEXT>

Glass screen protector is a must.

Buy a usb 3 cable as (at least for me) it didn't come with one in the box, which literally defies the point of having it..

To save battery life don't forget to disable "Samsung push service" and disable "auto update" in the Samsung app store, or it will reinstall itself.

Um.. If you're not used to using an amoled screen, I use Reddit sync with the specifically designed amoled theme (it's quite dark) which saves a considerable amount of battery life.

That's all for now off the top of my head.

<TITLE> Battery tips and tricks you may want to know. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-20 04:52:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi /r/Android I know we're not a help centre, but there's a lot of battery misinformation out there, I thought a post which contains some good info might be good to clear the air, and feel free to add your own tips and tricks.

* You don't need to charge your shiny new device straight from the box. In fact every cellphone I've ever come across since 2010 comes precharged to around 60%. 

    [Source: Li-ion does not need to be fully charged, as is the case with lead acid, nor is it desirable to do so. In fact, it is better not to fully charge, because a high voltage stresses the battery](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_lithium_ion_batteries)

* Charging every night will not ruin your battery life. The key word here is **ruin**. Unable to find any conclusive proof however. Your battery will charge to 100% and then the charger will switch off, and your phone will discharge over many hours to a preset level before the charger will flick back on and take it back up to 100%. As the source indicates, these 'microcharges' can be performed thousands of times with negligible impact to the battery capacity.  
    [Source: See Table 2 which indicates charging 10% can be done thousands of times](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries)

* Extra reading: However as evidence has [found it is best to have your device off and remove it once charged.](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_lithium_ion_batteries)

* Charge your phone in Offline mode (or ultra-battery saving mode if you have it) will significantly speed up charge time. Really handy if you don't have a lot of time and just need a quick boost. 

    [Source](http://www.instructables.com/id/Will-An-iPhone-Charge-Faster-On-Airplane-Mode/)

* If you've forgotten your charger, but have your cable at a hotel chances are the TV will have a USB port you can use in a pinch. (Or if there are limited power outlets and you have multiple devices to charge at once) 
    [Source](http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2012/07/charge-your-usb-gadgets-through-the-tv-in-your-hotel-room-when-travelling/)

* Try to avoid excessive heat unnecessarily. For instance never leave your phone in the sun on your dashboard, or by a window. Batteries really don't like being hot for very long. Once or twice is ok, but don't go making a habit of it. 

    [Source: "Lithium-ion suffers from stress when exposed to heat.." Table3](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries)

* If your phone has a tendency to randomly shut down, there is a chance your battery contacts have become too bad and need to be scratched. I've seen cellphones that wouldn't charge or turn on at all come to life immediately after lightly scratching the contacts with a sharp pin or knife.

    [Source: actually my own experiences working for 3 years in a consumer electronics store.]

* Modern smartphones feed usually as fast as the charger can give it. As a result if you're hunting for a charger look for a higher amperage.

    [Source: "Increasing the charge current does not hasten the full-charge state by much...A high current charge will, however, quickly fill the battery to about 70 percent." ](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_lithium_ion_batteries)

That's all I can think of for now, there is a lot of misinformation out there and thought /r/Android could be a trustworthy place for others to be confident about their battery usage. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As I'll keep repeating in all these threads - our distances are deceptive. Add a good 1hr to most Google estimates for trips.

It's a stunner of a road to take, prepare with warm clothes should you get stuck, but as pointed out a decent frost in the shadows of those hills can make even a light rain or mist turn to black ice really quickly.

Make sure your spare is pumped up and ready to go should you come off the road/get a flat. Look at hiring some chains, but it is only May so you should be fine.

If you have the time, take the longest route you can, as I said the drive is just beautiful.

Prepare to take breaks, agree before hand to only drive from X to X before the other person takes over. 

If you don't know the road, as it can be windy pull over and let the locals pass, they ~~might~~ will ride your ass if you're too slow.

And finally look for any waterfalls along the route, they can take an extra half hour to get to a random waterfall somewhere but it will stick with you for the rest of your trip!


*edit* FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PREPARE TO PUT YOUR CHAINS ON BEFORE YOU LEAVE! If you have to put chains on and you've never used them - it can take 30 minutes + the first time. That was in the garage at home. Fuck doing it for the first time ever in the snow, and then trusting your life to them..... </TEXT>

**Green light**

* Ok, send that last text message. It's very important to ensure your friend doesn't think you're ignoring you.
* Put your foot on the brake, take car out of park and into reverse
* Swear a few times as you once again attempt to put into drive.
* Let the car coast forward slightly as you don't like the lurch of the accelerator.
* Gently depress the accelerator pedal.
* Off you go.

**Orange light**

* What orange light? Last I looked it was green.
* Fuck it, I'm already 3 seconds from the intersection, that's not enough to stop!
* Screw it, it's green enough.
* As the light turns red.. I am GOD. Mere mortals stop for me.

**Red Light**

* Let's stop 15 feet from the car in front. Cause I may want to slowly coast forward. Or not. Either way I like the choice.
* Ooh, I have a red, but a green arrow! Let's lurch forward!  YAY!!!
* Ah it's still red. Back to texting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand $35 million dollars is a significant investment, so while I can empathetic, I'm struggling to muster sympathy.

They are as you point out following the "rules" but ironicaly I believe it's the current rules set by the media companies in regards to contracts and agreement prices for set television shows (to ensure they get the best price possible) that is actually working heavily against the on-sellers like Lightbox etc. 

I get the uneasy feeling the media companies themselves I'm sure don't want to see a Spotify-like company crop up as that might be seen as devaluing their product (E.g. Television shows) however much they actually make. 

You can't really argue against them (such is the profit driven Hollywood Corporations attitude) which makes acquiring the TV shows and charging a reasonable price almost impossible as I'm sure they place certain strict caveats against how much you can charge/how you can provide the content via DRM etc.

However having been just a mere fly on the wall viewing geographic paywalls slowly disintegrating for a few years now you have to wonder why their research didn't better understand the current market trends, and look at successful content providers such as Spotify or Netflix and working with/against the DRM restrictions to provide a middle ground that meet the demands of the consumers with the requirements of the corporations you're buying the product from.

I will happily admit it's admirable of them to be attempting to penetrate the pirate ridden waters of on-line media, I just feel this article justify their position to be somewhat farcical. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What a complete bullshit article.
Your product is only ever as good as someone wants to pay for it. 

You simply cannot come to the party late, holding stale produce and complain when noone buys it.

Where was Lightbox 3 years ago? That was when the market was waking up to the fact we are no longer a captive market, around the same time as Adidas [basically made a sign with a giant middle finger and said FUCK YOU NZ](http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/5410579/Adidas-stands-by-All-Blacks-jersey-price) you will pay what I fucking you tell you to pay by setting their RRP at a substantial rate above anywhere else in the world.

No, enough is enough. The internet has no geographical barriers, you can no longer justify business models that charge more simply because the IP comes from a different country. 

And then when you do compete with the free and open available of content internet in this day you better bring the big guns.

Take for instance Spotify, they very carefully judged their audience and have an advertising supported, and a pay-as-you-go business model. The key reason they have survived and thrived for so long is they are smart about it. They don't limit your listening to certain tracks for Free customers or paid, they limit the functionality instead.

Why lightbox etc are still insisting on the archaic model of limiting content (and relatively speaking very out of date content at that!) to buying customers only is just beyond me. 

You can't justify an aging business model with "Well the current system sucks, so I'm not going to change" cause that's just bullshit.

You can't sell water in a rainforest. We are no longer the captive market they love to price gouge off. 
Companies are attempting to justify an increase in price just because they want someone to pay that much.

<TEXT> When you have to factor in..

* Travel cost to get equipment to site.
* Hire price for the machines to rip it up, re seal it, smooth it over etc.
    * A machine to rip up old road
    * A machine to lay new seal
    * A machine to lay new arreggrate
    * A machine to smooth it all down
    * **Not sure if you can get 1 machine to do multiple jobs?**
* Getting council approval to take road.
* OSH precautions - Road cone's diversion plans.
* Advertising may be required if it's a main state HW - so cost of hiring a fuckoff sign for a week or two.
* Cost of 5+ staff perhaps.
* Cost of clean up (dumping waste etc.)
* Cost of tar seal.
* Cost of rock aggregate.
* Cost of portaloo for time period needed.

From seeing it done a few times, depending on damage.. 
They would need to:

* Dig up X amount off road
* Lay new substrate
* Lay new tar seal and chip it

Or at least that's my extremely layman's point of view, but I'm sure you wouldn't get much change from a 80-100K $ per KM. And then you factor in redoing the bridge, this will be signifcantly higher due to probably needing to shut down the bridge/have a stop/go so probably nearer $300-400k per KM

Edit: he's recording for at least say 3minutes using this [distance calculator website cause I'm lazy..](http://www.machinehead-software.co.uk/bike/speed_distance_time_calc.html) and he's travelling at 90km/h for the entire trip, say 2minutes at 90km/h = 3kms.

So to answer your question, I would hazard a guess of around (at least) $1,000,000+ to redo the road the fucktard ripped up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok,  let's look at meridian energy for instance. 

They generate energy which pays dividends to the government and private corporations. 
These dividends are supported by worth and profit.
To maintain their worth they must generate a X amount of profit.
They get profit from selling energy to consumers.
An extra charge (say to Maori for water rights) eats into the profit, which means they have to charge you and I more to maintain the same worth, and continue to pay dividends.

So essentially you and I will be paying more, which will be subsiding the water payment.

So again, I pay a amount which goes to government which they use to better the entire country.
If they are successful I will pay more money which will only benefit Maori.

How is this fair? 

Again I understand if the water was Tapu, or they simply want more money, and you and I will be paying for it.

<TEXT> Preparing for the bashing here, but seriously over this fucking profit grab.

Unlike the money which is currently gathered for water rights us used by all kiwi under say the local council who charge for the usage rights, this money will go to exclusive rights to the Maori. 

How is that not racist in it's own rights? "I don't want everyday NZ'ers to benefit from the water, I want ONLY Maori to benefit from the water use." Fuck That Shit.

Edit: if you're going to downvote me, tell me why I'm wrong.
I understand the Treaty of Waitangi, I understand Maori have rights to the LAND which was taken from them, but water is a renewable resource, it's not Tapu, how can they claim rights to be able to sell it off and make the profit from it? And take profit away from everyday NZ'ers? </TEXT>

The trouble is if the assholes are going to do it to you, chances are they will try it on with someone else, so fully don't give up.

By seeking legal advice you could let them know you're playing hard ball, which could be enough to scare them into paying without any further fuss. 

I'm not sure were you are, but here's a [Free phone Canterbury Law advice helpline](http://www.canlaw.org.nz/legal-info-by-phone)

[Or find your local community law centre](http://www.communitylaw.org.nz/your-local-centre/find-a-community-law-centre/)

Edit: ensure ALL your correspondence with them is captured, if you phone them put them on speaker and have another phone recording them. Of course tell them: "For complete disclosure, this call is being recorded and may be used should this matter have to go to court." it might seem like a dick move, but if it's your word against theirs don't make their life any easier.  </TEXT>

But that does raise a good point, now this could be because I see a very censored view of NZ policing via police television shows, but I see your point in that if someone is doing 1 thing dodgy, chances are likely they're also doing other stupid shit - like if they're not wearing their seatbelt, they could have an unrego'd car or something.

So if you were stupid enough to drive with your needle above the +5km mark, you're going to get caught. 

Drive at 50-55km/h and you're going to get lasered at 48-53km/h no problems.

If you drink and and drive once with quite a few on board = cash and demerits.
Again = cash and demerits.
Again cash and and demerits.

The definition of stupidity is doing exactly the same thing and expecting the same result. Stupid fuckers are going to be stupid fuckers. 

Demerits? They'll drive anyway. Thanks to under staffed police they're willing to risk it.

Fines? fuck it - throw it on my tab! Then when it grows too big, the court inevitably sentence them to a hundred hours or so community detention. Which if you work it out for some of the worst offenders, they are essentially being paid at a rate of a FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS AN HOUR? It's a fucking joke.

Instead of subscribing to some shitty unreliable expensive HDD recorder, or paying money to still have advertising anyway we can download and watch them them on any TV or mobile device whenever/wherever we want!

* Easier: Again without DRM restrictions, it's a "Hey mate, here's a flash drive with the latest GoT episode".

* Cheaper: Sky increased their prices recently, the Commerce Commission investigated and basically said "Sky are a monopoly and can charge whatever they want." (I'm not kidding.)

* Access to just soooo much more content than **anyone** can offer NZ consumers. 

So tell me where's the draw card for going through the piss poor selection available to NZ buyers? You've provided a poor service, years too late, and for way to much money. Then you bitch about it?

They can charge as much as they want, but unless the market things it's a fair deal it ain't going to happen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They specifically touted "Zero" tolerance over the Xmas break, which failed epically. 

It would good be for a police person to confirm, but I've seen most cars not get caught at 5-7km/h so I can only presume they're lowering the tolerance to only 4km/h and will be more vigilant in pulling you over/issuing a fine? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Just want to let /r/NewZealand know about Neighbourly.co.nz a private (NZ only) community based website for local events and happenings. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-02 02:12:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi /r/NewZealand,

Neighbourly.co.nz is a Fairfax run community congregation website designed to help connect neighbours communicate and keep in touch about local events and goings on. 

Local area events like:

* BBQ's 
* Work wanted
* Local fairs
* Garage sales
* Community events like Street Parties
Etc.

This is all dependent upon local involvement, obviously someone needs to post these events, but as it's been out for a wee while now, and thanks to advertising drives it is getting more and more popular, so while there may not be much happening in your area it's worth sticking with it. 

My sister in Wellington really waxed lyrical about it so thought it was worth a go so I signed up recently and was quite surprised with the amount of people in my area using it. 

Depending on your local politician and police involvement you can also receive alerts like local burgarlies and political speaking events in your area as well.

When you sign up initially you can gain immediate access by supplying a cellphone number, but you do have limited interaction until you receive a letter by post containing your verification code as to confirm your identity and your local area. This can take a wee while. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reading the [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lundy_murders) the whole affair is actually horribly hilarious in a cruel and twisted way.

Mark was found guilty in 2002. 

Sentenced to Life, minimum non-parole of 17 years.

He then appealed and this was increased to a non-parole of 20 years.

He then appealed again, and was immediately sentenced to 20 years non-parole.

**He's been found guilty THREE TIMES**

He was eligible to get out in 2019 had he been a good prisoner. Now he can't get out 'til 2022. And I wonder if the fact he still maintains his innocence will count against him in his parole hearings? </TEXT>

The only thing we can keep doing is keep reporting this kind of stuff and sign petitions to ensure there's minimal impact to the local flora and fauna (if onshore) and minimal disruption to our marine environment (if offshore.) 

Yes I would amazing if the world could suddenly perform an about turn and stop using oil etc, but the simple fact is that isn't going to happen for a few years. 

In the meantime we need to be smart about how we whore out our natural resources. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nice. 

Looks like a very well rounded device, they've addressed quite a few complaints about the S5 - speaker placement, camera quality, build quality, fingerprint scanner, heartrate monitor, TouchWiz GUI.

And just improved upon what makes Samsung devices really nice - Screen quality.

I'm sure they implemented some wizardry with the Exynos and the AMOLED as there was an article in /r/android last night fron Engadget a while ago. They implemented stuff like ignoring refreshing pixels that don't change based upon what's on the screen, which helped up to 10% better battery life on the S5, little doubt this has helped the battery last so long despite the bump in pixels on the S6.

For a start  "As an example, with a day that was full of gaming and picture taking, the battery died just past the 10 hour mark." how completely unscientific can you be? Couldn't they at least posted SOT or battery stats of this?

And then in the "positives" putting "Battery life just above average" that doesn't sound like a positive to me.

And the camera review, what a fucking joke he didn't even clean the camera lens, you can tell by the massive light ghosting in the bar shots there's grease on the lens.

Feels like this phone was handed to someone who's owned a few smart phones, felt like they were a pro in reviewing and went to the bar, had a few beers and wrote this up in an hour or two.

The reviews for the latest device aren't anywhere near as scathing as the S5 reviews (Remember everyone's favourite catchup for bagging the S5? -"Evolution over revolution") so while it's not the best move they played it safe.

They may not have Samsung's mega dollars to be able to release an entirely new device within the short life cycle that people are coming to expect from cellphone makers these days, and why would they?
The market responded [favourably](https://au.finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=2498.TW#symbol=2498.TW;range=) to the move, so actually they've done quite well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This isn't "catastrophic" but it is a joke.

The S6 uses both the CPU and storage speed boost for really nifty things like increasing the camera boot time to allow you to open it very quickly with only a couple taps of the home button. 
A slower processor and this would not be possible.

Also the mobile industry falls heavily upon benchmarks, and graphs to show better phone, the majority of people never really play with their flash new device for any more than a few minutes in stores, so rely on the internet to prove why it should buy 1 device over another.

A difference of 23000 *benchmark* points most certainly will pull those with no brand loyalty to the faster device. 

There is no other draw card HTC have here. (And don't you dare mention design, if they wanted design they would have already bought the M8 over the S5. You can't panda to the same audience for 3 years running (aluminium and glass) without nearing the saturation point in a lot of markets. 

HTC needed a "Wow factor" and this chipset is not it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm loving the denial in this thread:

"It's not going to make a shit phone, it's an awesome phone, it's **just** running a shit processor."

"It's not going to be any slower than a Samsung S6, benchmarks don't mean anything in the real world."

"They didn't throttle the chip, it's just software tweaks."

HTC have had YEARS to play with the 810.. (Seriously, phone development takes at least 2+ years from drawing board to anything close to fruition. Even when you're only tweaking the previous iteration)

And this is the *best* they could come up with!?

Go on, downvote me, you know damn well I'm right. </TEXT>

When it dropped consistantly to 3 hours SOT plus 12 hours standby I did a factory reset and that took it back up to 4 hours.. So the key to any good measure is reliability, SOT is able to be a reliable benchmark. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As would I, the frustration however arises from when minorities are allowed concessions that the majority does not feel are warranted by their requirements, or religious beliefs.

This potentially stems from a few things:

* Misunderstanding the core religious laws which require consumer law to be changed in order to comply. 
* Frustration at the laws passed for religious reasons that allow a religious person a significant concession while still applying the same law heavily upon non-believers.

Surely you can understand the frustration when one must relinquish their tweezers, while a potentially sharp metal object designed to protect oneself is allowed on board without question due to ones religious beliefs. </TEXT>

I thought it was due to the ethanol sinking to the bottom of the water, but thank you for explaining it's mixed throughout the drink. I think in my particular circumstance /u/MoltenSlag has hit the nail on head in that it's due to the fizzy escaping the drink, coupled with a rise in temperature, makes sense.

<TEXT> We have deceptive times on Google between major landmarks, allow +1 hour for most journeys on your GPS.

Most of our motorways out of the major arterial routes are unlit, unpoliced and barely maintained so require constant vigilance. 

We do sometimes have wandering livestock, but not very often.

And unfortunately you have to contend with the average Kiwi Driver who greatly over estimates their driving abilities. 

Basic rules to be mindful of: 

* Do NOT expect people to stop at STOP signs.
* Do not EVER expect people will see you on the road.
* Expect pedestrians to not look before stepping out on the road. 
* Expect drivers to not hear your horn (wearing headphones while driving is a common passtime.)
* Do not expect to just 'find a park' any where, at any point in time, always give +10 minutes to find a park in most central areas.
* Expect drivers to tailgate badly (Seriously, NZ drivers love acting like the human equivalent of hemorrhoids. 
* Expect drivers will speed up during passing lanes (120+km/h)
* Further to the above expect drivers to be driving slowly on the motorway (80-90km/h)
* Do no expect drivers to indicate
* Expect drivers to pull out without looking 
* When approaching a T intersection expect cars coming around the corner to cut into your lane
* Basically expect dangerously
* Not obeying Stop signs, Give way signs, or any kind of sign for that matter
* Driving dangerous driving at all times. 
* Be surprised when Drivers obey the road rules
* Etc..

Edit: I'm from Chch and I encounter the above on a daily basis and I only travel about an hour or around 35km a day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with your point, although even your example has a tinge of arrogance - only looking one way when we're all taught to look both ways regardless.

If your assessment is correct, and complacency and drivers revert to a 'comfortable' level of driving on our roads then I can't help but wonder how/if we can even approach this from an education standpoint, I guess the arrows on the road are a good step, but a quick test (as many propose) would quickly become a distant memory when passing the 15th dead possum on the road from Nelson to Twizel, rendering any skills learnt at arrival void as one slips back to their standard routine.

How can you even stop this? I honestly don't think you can. (Except for the billboards advising tired drivers etc to pull over - but if they can't read English or have a tight schedule they won't care?) </TEXT>

Mindful the neighbours car was broken in to a couple weeks back  I rang local police to report the van in case. They offered some friendly advice which in retrospect seemed obvious - just go and talk to them? 

So I went out, had a quick chat. It was an Asian couple, they spoke very broken English but the gist of it was they had just arrived in NZ, and were going on a long trip and wanted to make sure they were comfortable driving with the new car, and were used to driving on our roads before they headed off! They kept repeating "Safety!".

I thought it was very nice of them to take the responsibility so seriously. 

I just wanted to share this with you all to highlight the vast majority of tourists are responsible on our roads, it's just the incompetent arrogant few who ruin it for the many. </TEXT>

I love the figures, but when you have the first decent review:

And the top comment is "Worse battery than last years by a bit. But unless the M9 can blow me away with battery (which in all honesty I expect it to), I still think my next phone will be the S6 ^Edge?"

You're pushing shit uphill trying to impress most of the trolls here that Samsung can produce a good, well rounded device.

A few select flagship varieties were upgraded first for influential markets to ensure people still bought the device, knowing it was going to be upgraded, however for the markets that they don't think people will buy a phone based upon the latest OS (smaller countries like NZ) they didn't bother releasing the latest ROM for.

(There's a website called "geekzone.co.nz" which allows the tech geeks from Vodafone/Telecom/2Degrees to chat with the users, and they've confirmed as of Feb they haven't even seen the latest Lollipop ROM for any S5's yet. 

So Samsung aren't just scattering them once they've been approved, they're not even bothering to release them to be tested by local carriers. 

Preeeety frustrating. </TEXT>

The funny (!) thing is I was utterly slammed on /r/android for picking this up on an early review of the G Glex2 after a youtube pre-release benchmark was released. I insinuated it was not an accurate test due to only running 1 benchmark at a time (and unknown cool down period between) and people left more than a couple of unsavory comments as a resut, so I think there are more than a few people who just don't want to know the truth sadly, and the review websites are pandering to this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> HTC are barely treading water in the mobile market. Only so many people want a certain type of device.

Samsung have realised this, and done a more shot-gun approach of have a device for every piece, none particularly great, but adequate. This failed when their flag ship's sales weren't great. 

Oppo/One Plus have gone for cheap but good market, which is serving them well so far.

HTC have gone for the same market, 3 years running. You can only satisfy so many people in the world with 1 thing, before people start asking for alternatives.

Yes, their design **was** great, and won awards, but if they want to survive they either need Apple's iSheep affect to help the same thing, or they need to adapt.

They have not adapted by upgrading the Internal's, as one commenter on here mentioned, his 2 year old M7 is still more than adequate due to the chipset, so upgrading the internals is not adapting, as this isn't a very marketable changed this only serves to illustrate my point they have failed to innovate by upgrading their chipset with the same externals!

I mean people are arguing with me - saying that the people who bought their old device complained about certain features, which were then changes. 

So are you telling me HTC are marketing to the same people who buy their old devices? Again, they're going to/have already hit market saturation in some areas, so I was looking for some diversification from their design, or at least a better enhancement than a purely under the hood modification.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not arguing it was once a beautiful piece of kit, however consumers needs and demands change a lot over 3 years. As they don't release many other models (and certainly those don't tend to go to the same markets as the one does, they are making up consumers minds for them by saying this is the only screen size you need. Or this is the only design of phone you should ever want. 


That is arrogant. And as I mentioned, design awards aside people slammed Samsung for "evolution over revolution" with their devices, yet praise HTC for doing the same damn thing year after year? 

The review websites are very carefully avoiding mentioning the design copy paste. It's fucking hypocritical to the max and I'm so over the tall poppy syndrome. 

You tell me you aren't disappointed the same designers who made the original m7 have failed to improve upon their design in ***any way shape or form?*** </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would argue, citing Samsung and Sony as two prime culprits who have done this - produced very similar looking devices year after year and they have subsequently had their mobile divisions post significant losses.

As the pundits loved to say about the S5 - "Evolution over Revolution" simply isn't enough to stay relevant in today's fast paced mobile industry.

A good example of this is Samsung - they are rapidly faced with losing their (once lion's) share of Android sales. 

Should your logic ring true the sames of the S5 was released with no major cosmetic changes (argueable of course) over the S4, sales tanked.

As a result, faced with a do or die situation (which may be overstating it..) they have done a complete about turn on two things which were once elemental to their design ethos - SD card and removable back panel.

People may have no design changes presented to them, however the market has shown it will not stand for it, and no manufacturer is totally immune from public opinion swaying against them if they feel like said manufacturer is merely using their brand name as a means to sell products. 

Of course I'd have to be a blind idiot to not realise it's not a significant part of the consumers purchasing decision. However, this is not, and I doubt ever will be the ultimate reason people chose 1 device over the other.

As a result they need a "catch" a reason to say "I'm going with manufacturer XYZ because I like their design ***and this new feature*** is what is making me buy their product.

HTC have unfortunately fallen into this, thinking they can get away with people buying their product purely because they're HTC. Correct me if I am wrong, but by producing the (mostly) ~~identical~~ same product for 3 years in a row is most certainly them telling the consumers "You don't need that extra special feature because ***I, HTC*** have made this."

As I mentioned earlier the only company who could pull this off is Apple. And HTC are as far from Apple as chalk and cheese.

However, if you have examples where you believe this may work, I am more than open for a good discussion! :)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> HTC are basically admitting they're fucking useless and suck ass at innovating, so they have to cheat by kneecapping their old phone in order to sell the new one.

They are admitting there's little reason for people to upgrade otherwise, and it's the fucking losers option to destroy the competition (their old phone) rather than produce a device which they know will sell on it's own merits. Because it won't, because it's a fucking clone of the previous 2 versions before it.

And furthermore, EVERYONE fucking bagged on Samsung for "evolution rather than revolution" with their S5 product, but HTC have done it for 3 years in a row, and everyone thinks they're fucking Gods. 

The phone industry are a bunch of fucking hypocrites with a severe case of tall poppy syndrome.

I mean where the fuck is innovation? Innovation isn't using the damn processor as everyone else. Or using the same fucking camera sensor as everyone else, it's putting up new ideas, and actually standing by the choices you make. 

As HTC have shown however they are not innovators, they are fucking sheep who don't even have the balls to work on their ultra-pixel camera. And everyone is actually congratulating them for this phone!? And looking forward to it!?! The same crowd who called for Samsung's blood for daring to release the S5 which was "too similar to the S4" and yet here we have the SAME PHONE 3 years in a god damn row!

<TEXT> Let's be honest here, most people already have a perfectly functional device, it's the WOW factor that makes people crave the latest.

Makers are slowly realizing they need a "Buy This MotherFucking Phone, It Will Make All The Girls Panties Drop at the mere site of your awesomeness."

One needn't look any further than Samsung thinking they could get away with largely a "Me too" phone with their Samsung S5. Not even ~~waterproofing~~ water resistance or a dodgy heart rate monitor could help the fact that the phone largely feels like a S4 in your hand. 

Potential owners need a flash factor, something that makes people go: "Wow, what's that phone?" It makes them feel good, and helps to avoid buyers regret.

However HTC have missed the boat entirely. If customers want a good HTC phone, they could very easily go with the M8 and not miss anything from the new version.

Put it this way: 

Your contract is up, you walk into TMobile, and go excellent, I can get a new phone!

How a layman sees it while looking at what phone to buy:

**Screen:**

* M7: 4.7 FHD

* M8: 4.7 FHD

* M9: 4.7 FHD

**Design:**

* M7: Aluminum unibody

* M8: Aluminum unibody

* M9: Aluminum unibody

**Operating system:**

* M7: Lollipop

* M8: Lollipop

* M9: Lollipop

**Speakers:**

* M7: Front Stereo

* M8: Front Stereo

* M9: Front Stereo

**Camera:** 

* M7: Takes photos

* M8: Takes photos

* M9: Takes photos

Why would you walk out of that store with a phone that looks and feels just like the 2 year old phone sitting next to it?.. 

Most people won't - they will turn to the Samsung for a larger screen, or Sony or Samsung for ~~waterproof~~ water resistance, or Huawei for a cheapie to tide them over. 

There's just no justification why most people with last year (or the year before) should upgrade to this model. 

Don't get me wrong, people will buy it, but there's zero WOW factor, and this will cost HTC sales to their competitors. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Very true. 

They really couldn't afford to rest on their laurels this year, and they don't have the Apple Effect^ to pump out a "S" version and think people will buy the new thing.

Same screen size as M8, same exterior as M8, same speakers (indifferent to most users) as M8, same interface with Lollipop as M8.. 

The users aren't going to notice (largely) a 'beneath the hood' CPU/GPU or RAM upgrade, as most aren't power users who benefit from alt+tabbing.

They needed to make current M7/M8 owners jealous, they have not succeeded.

<TITLE> Why Do Samsung Smartphone Engineers Prioritize Slow Shutter speed and Low ISO over High Shutter Speed and High ISO? Examples given. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-22 22:24:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi /r/Android I just basically want to try and understand why Samsung have a hard-on for using rediculously low expsosure times on a hand-held camera.

I have a 6mth old child, so naturally he's always moving, and as I've recently upgraded to a Galaxy S5 over an S4 I was really looking forward to taking semi-decent quick exposure photos.

I've been horribly disappointed that basically the bloody camera defaults to an (obscenely low)1/33 for EVERY scenario and just alters to ISO to cope, except for extremely bright scenarios!

To back this claim up I've gone through my photos and summarized the settings the camera chose:

* In a well lit pool environment (Shutter 1/33 ISO250), 

* In a zoo on a sunny day (Shutter 1/33-1/110 ISO40-80), 

* At home with good natural light (Shutter: **1/17-1/20** ISO 320-100) 

* And out and about (Shutter **1/15** ISO400)

Even with an APS-C sensor D7000 with 50mm F2.2 fails to take decent photos at 1/17 hand held for goodness sake! And coupled with Samsung's utterly bullshit excuse for *software image stabilization* you just cannot use the damn camera for any sort of even partially low-light scenario with even slow moving objects!

To make matters worst I've taken photos with the iPhone5S and iPhone6 and noticed that..

* They take higher ISO photos.

* They have vastly superior software image stabilsation.

After having used the S4 *(which I usually didn't even bother to try and take quick photos on as it barely focus in anything other than perfect burn-your-retina bright sunlight)* for a year, I'm really disappointed in Samsung for doing very very little in the image stabilization department, I had hoped they would utilise the ISOCELL sensor to increase the shutter priority and allow for higher ISO's but this is simply not the case.

I will concede the focusing accuracy, especially in low-light is 99% better, but this is useless if you can focus on your item, but the resulting photos is ruined by the smallest quiver of your hand!

I'm stuck with the damn thing for now, but I just hope them to open the camera API and allow me to use smarter camera software to set higher shutter speed's or at least higher ISO's! 

**(It would appear the arrogant fuckheads have chosen to ignore the new API with Lollipop for now)**

Is there anything I should be doing differently? 

Is there a better Android camera fullstop which will produce faster photos? 

What do you think, am I just being a whiny little bitch? </TEXT>

Also with 4K TV's becoming eye poppingly cheap it's quite affordable for people replacing their current sets. 

And furthermore given the competitor has been offering this feature for a while you can't tell me there's not a market for it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, but as I mentioned earlier the 4mp module on the HTC M8 simply doesn't have the same dynamic range of the higher pixel sensors resulting in washed out highlights and lack of detail in the shadows.

I agree Apple have things right - they've gone with 8mp coupled with phenomenal software support resulting in one of the best cameras for an all round solution. 

I have an S5 and cannot understand how awesome the phase detection is for focusing, especially in low light. But why they didn't incorporate all the technologies into a single unit is beyond me.

I'm hoping HTC pull finger and release an awesome unit (phase detection/range finder/OIS), coupled with fantastic camera software (Zoe?) and just blow everyone out of the water. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know if you read the review, they had to deliberately cool the phone down between benchmarks. LG were contacted who advised they are still tweaking the final product, so perhaps it was a pre-release hiccup.

I reckon Qualcomm have got a lot riding on this after Samsung's snubbing, so I daresay they'll be working closely with LG to ensure there are no issues. </TEXT>

Extra megapixels also allow you to crop photos after you've taken them.
Extra megapixels allow higher quality (read:4k) camera capabilities.
(Note this last point may be why HTC rumours indicate 2 camera modules on the M9? - 1 high pix for UHD video, other Low "ultrapix" module.)

<TEXT> You have to hand it to HTC, however you needn't look any further than the decision by Sony to [release the Z3 as a 1080 screen](http://au.ibtimes.com/xperia-z3-sony-unwilling-sacrifice-battery-life-2k-smartphones-1368833) which they were slated for and forced to explain why. (Battery life of course..)

However it proves the world (as of September 2014) wants 1440+ higher screen sizes in their flagships, so it's going to be a risky move. Then again HTC are if anything happy to take risks! </TEXT>

<TITLE> PSA: Weird Spotify behaviour. Spotify mobile sometimes holds a Wakelock open, preventing your phone going into low-power mode while you've got an active session in Spotify on your desktop/laptop. </TITLE>

<TEXT> I was listening to music on my mobile, but closed it via the X on the notification widget. However when I started listening soon after on my desktop I still had Spotify controls on my lock screen only. 

I guess the *feature* here is you can pause/next your music without going back to the Application on your desktop. The severe downside is it keeps a wakelock open, draining your phones battery.

Because it doesn't display the ability to shutdown (No widget in the Notification centre) so I've found the only way to stop the wakelock is to Force Stop the Spotify Process in Android Application Management.

Ignore if this doesn't bother you, but I use Spotify on my desktop to save my battery life, which makes it kinda pointless to keep my phone awake. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Android RAM management has become significantly better than older Android versions. These days with richer Applications and more RAM than ever before actually clearing your RAM can result in an impact to battery life as the OS needs to reload the Apps back into the RAM you just cleared. (For instance most Opera Mobile using desktop mode has over 200-300MB of RAM constantly.)

Likewize with Application cache (the other reason people use them) I can appreciate people who have very limited device storage using them, but they're a crutch as if you have to use it more than once a week due to space issues, chances are you need to upgrade your phone anyway. </TEXT>

but yes, I hear you on the low light issue. 
This is something that needs to be fixed on the sensor as IOS is not the silver bullet we need.

(From the screenshot comparisons between the S5 and Note4 (although different sensor Sony IMX240 vs Samsung's Isocell) the differences for the lowlight shots are not as awesome as I expected the OIS to be able to perform with the Note4.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well you see on your graph how the 'awake' is damn near a constantly solid line! 
While your Screen on graph is only sporadic and doesn't match with your 'awake' line.

This basically indicates there's errant background processes which is sapping your battery life.

These errant processes are usually:
Google scanning for your location (as requested by Adware on your cellphone)
Google Now waking up your phone to either see your location or present you new cards.
Weather Apps/widgets updating.
Email/Facebook apps updating themselves.
Background data use (think Spotify/music playing etc.)

The best way to determine what's sapping your battery life is to get Wakelock Detector.
(However due to the fact Google are bastards they don't want you to be able to access the indepth analysis battery stats.)
So you need to use a work around (nothing scary!).

Step 1- acquire a windows PC.
Step 2- Go here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1r3VlhZIZVSufZlAeICJet6QBtyAF7z06_ysl1kUKME4/edit#slide=id.g298bc178a_00
Step 3- follow instructions.

I've done it a few times now, this will allow you to actually see your Wakelock stats (so in effect that's sapping your battery life by waking up your phone!)

Once you have your Wakelock stats post a screenshot on this subreddit can we can help you to determine what's the matter. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To answer the op, technically no. But it's very relative to your previous experience with screens. 

What I mean is if you haven't had an amoled before and look at the note 4 you may think the color and other amoled properties are a QHD attribute. 


There's the old (and very relevant) issue of the human eye simply being unable discern the individual pixels, above a certain dpi. 

This shouldn't be ignored, however at 5.7 inches I'm willing to believe those with extremely good eye sight can see a difference under optimum conditions. 

Is it worth it (I know not what op asked, but these two questions are closely related) for most people an awesome FHD amoled will provide the same wow factor and provide awesome battery life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's the impact to the image of the company they represent that the company are worrying about.

For instance an older person might hear a rumour that 2 married employees have an affair and will choose to take their business elseware. A younger person however would go "whatever." so given this is an insurance company, they will be looking at the age etc of their clientele to determine whether this is enough to make people not use them. 

Of course the other side of the coin is that the company may realise (perhaps after an analysis from a PR agency which I daresay is already happening) that they in fact gained from their employees indiscretion and may allow them to keep their jobs.  </TEXT>

Look, my point was if there was an unfortunate series of events, the TCAS is the last hope to avoid a collision. 

Without their transponder operational, TCAS is useless.

I'm not saying they ever got close enough to cause this, or ever intended to but having their transponder off in such an environment (around civvie aircraft) is reckless, surely you could agree to that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The reason they had to be escorted away immediately is because the world has a very effective and proven collision avoidance system, but but it relies on an active [transponder](http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision_avoidance_system) which the douchebags had turned off. 

Do you really think this would have been so funny if a commercial airliner collided with one of these guys because that was a real possibility.

You can't just fly in international airspace without your transponder on, that is just incredibly arrogant and puts lives at risk. 

Of course they knew this was going to happen the moment they flew into commercial airspace. 

For fucks sake why are they risking an international disaster by bringing down an airliner in a mid air collision while the world is itching for an excuse to start WW3? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, this has happened 3 times now so I know it can't be just me. this is irregardless of power saving, screen brightness and there are no errant wakelocks (using Wakelock Detector via PC Developer mode as not support by KitKat.)

Brand new phone stats:
   
***Brand new Samsung S4 i9506***

    4 hours Screen-On-Time, 12+ hours standby.

***Battery life at 6 months:***
    
    2 hours SOT -8 hours standby.
    
***Did a factory reset:***
   
    4 hours SOT 12 hours awake.

***3 months later:***
        
    2 hours SOT, 8 hours standby.

***Another factory reset:***
   
    4 hours SOT, 12 hours+ standby.

***3 months ago now:***
   
    2 hours SOT, -8 hours standby.   

***Last weekend back again:***

    4 hours SOT, 12 hours+ standby

TL:DR battery life is significantly enhanced by a factory reset even if same Apps are installed immediately afterwards. Why is this? </TEXT>

Or companies transferring information that could bring down corporations.

If back doors exists they are a weakness, which can be exploited and will be by both governments and whoever is either smart or lucky enough to stumble upon it.

In short fuck off, leave us alone and stop treating everyone like damn terrorists, cause that's working so well for you so far ay?

Secondly don't link to it with the main header, as that just piques your interest into downloading it, which rather defies the original purpose of the post.

<TEXT> Well I can thank you for putting me right. 
I strive to make at least semi educated comments, and it's become apparent I have missed the mark here somewhat. Consider me enlightened. :-) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I respect what you're saying, but as a layman I have only my opinions based upon reported isolated incidents- articles like this? And other stories brought to me by the media. 
I only know what I read on the internet, and (as with most subjects) what the media portrays. 

Based upon the above my comment still stands however based upon my opinion formed. 

As you're educated on the subject I understand where you're coming from and it must be frustrating to read comments like mine, but let's be honest here, it's not likely to change as the media aren't going to change how they report things of this nature - e.g. "anticorruption measure" stories will get buried amongst stories about corrupt officials each and every time, so can you blame me?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm saying the country as a whole is very average - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_in_India

"..But many analysts believe India's sprawling bureaucracy and weak institutionsthe police and judiciary were ranked as the second and third most corrupt institutions in India, respectively, after political partieshave thwarted convictions, and arguably increased incentives for bribery. In recent years, graft pervaded society from small-scale "harassment bribes" (payments for essential social services) to scandals on a national level. At least 42 percent of young Indians have paid a bribe, according to a 2012 Hindustan survey"
[source](http://www.cfr.org/corruption-and-bribery/governance-india-corruption/p31823)

And I specifically refer to the corrupt judge's trial - http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bribery-charges-trial-against-judge-may-finally-begin/article4978237.ece

And now this, which the high court has thrown out as clearly some very dodgy motions were passed without due diligence. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The night mode didn't adjust for 'night mode' at all. Then I went into my default Samsung camera, selected Night Mode, then hopped out and back into 'a better camera' and voila - night mode activated.

Also flicking between front and back screens causes the camera to freeze for around 2 seconds.

Also changing to and from Video - camera mode causes screen to freeze, need to escape it and get back in.

And HD video quality is piss poor when pixel peeping vs stock Samsung S4.

On the PLUS side, takes very nice HDR photos. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I found Opera crashed frequently, but that was a few months ago I last tried it.

To be honest my phone didn't feel "right" after installing it, Apps were a bit slow to respond, and crashed infrequently, but often enough to make me uninstall, and everything went back to normal.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you kindly good sir.

Edit: Actually it is a much better low-light camera than the standard App, (Samsung S4) as it focuses better, and with the HDR mode always on, offers an advantage over the HDR mode over the Stock S4 camera as HDR has to be selected everytime, through a rather clunky menu. 

Very good, and hell, it's free so always a worth a shot! </TEXT>

<TEXT> For those in NZ - TVNZ's Android App.

Steaming pile of buggy, laggy, useless shit.
They update it about once every 6 months, it crashes around once every 20 minute episode and it takes forever to buffer/load your programs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> With Wakelock detector, Facebook and Facebook Messenger each wake up my device around 600 times (!!) in a given day to check for news.

My battery life has increased significantly since I removed messenger, and just don't get messages until I'm at a PC. 

For a casual user bloody pathetic and small minded for them to "Save me a few seconds". I'm not even kidding, Mark - suckerdick honestly told people he cut out Messenger into its own App so save a few seconds when checking/reading messages. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Zombie Gunship.

Takes up 92MB on a Samsung S4.
Very light on the battery life. 
Very easy to use/learn but hard to master.
Each "game" only takes around 4-5 minutes.

What I especially like is the ability to pause in game, and in the case of my S4, I can leave it running in the background and send a txt message, and then using task manager go back to my paused game.

<TEXT> This is prettty stupid way of testing your speed, quite a few ISP's actually cache frequently downloaded information, such as Origin or Steam downloads. They pay less as they host the data locally, and it means you download at really good speeds.

Not an accurate representation in the slightest. </TEXT>
