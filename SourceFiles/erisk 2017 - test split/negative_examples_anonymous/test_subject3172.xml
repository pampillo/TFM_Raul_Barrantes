<TEXT> The "professional-looking dude not wearing pants" thing is sort of a comedy trope; it's been applied to news anchors, judges, etc. If either party is a woman then the under- and overtones shift too far. When it's just guys then it can work if employed advisedly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A couple of years ago I met a recruiter at a conference and we hit it off immediately. At some point he asked me a somewhat personal question and I answered without a flinch. Then he said, "I probably also shouldn't ask this, but are you wearing panties?"

I said, "Who told you about my panties?" and he busted out laughing.

The job and I weren't right for each other, but I would have loved working with that guy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I read a lot about the online world before I could afford a computer, so my introduction was gradual; I knew a couple of people on BBSs and they showed me around a little.

Funny story: While gathering information I learned about the WELL, so I called their office (this would be about '94) and asked someone to send me an info packet. He sounded very apologetic when he said "I'll be sending this through the mail, so it will take a couple of days to reach you. Is that OK?" </TEXT>

<TEXT> This will probably not be seen, but ... someone said something interesting to me along these lines, relating to a discussion about young people's impressions of 9/11: that we miss out on that gray area between current events and taught history that happens in our youth.

 Adults don't usually talk to kids about the news of the day, and news sources aren't usually very accessible to children. And by the time those things are set down in history books, a microgeneration has missed learning about them. Then by the time the child is adult, no other adult is going to say to them, "Let's discuss the history and context of 9/11."

My high school history classes said little about the Vietnam War, and most of what I "learned" in later years came from movies; if Hollywood hadn't mined that vein so thoroughly I probably still would be in the dark about it.* People born in the mid-1970s probably know little to nothing about the Reagan era, which was a very formative period for me. And so on. And as far as I know we don't examine these generational lacunae much, if at all.

*as opposed to mostly knowing the movie version, which is just a different form of ignorance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What /u/spacejack_ said: Sony didn't license the Betamax format to other companies, so if you wanted a Beta player you had to buy Sony. JVC licensed the VHS format so anyone could make one, and competition pushed prices down.

For years after Betamax left the consumer market it was still in wide use in video production. Until digital video finally won out, if you saw a TV news crew on the street they probably had Betamax cameras.

The same dynamic happened between Apple and Microsoft in the 1980s; Apple's products were better in a lot of ways, but they were the only source, so for a long time they were just a niche player. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Eh. I've taken Greyhound a lot, and I have no horror stories. My fellow passengers have tended to be among the downtrodden, but they have generally been nice folks. The main problems have been with the bus itself -- breaking down, running late, etc. And that doesn't happen all that often.

Now, I finally quit taking the bus once when I traveled to Nebraska in December and a blizzard hit the entire Great Plains; I had to stay days longer than I had planned because even after the roads were cleared, the "upstream" highways were still closed and the buses couldn't get there.

I still take the bus for short hops, like NYC-DC. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm close to your age with a similarly intimidating amount of student debt (and I never even finished my doctorate). Other commenters' advice about income-based repayments and loan forgiveness is invaluable; be sure to follow up. I found that getting that process started helped the feeling of powerlessness ease off, and it's made a difference in how well I function. 

It helps also to just know there are others in similar financial boats who are functioning OK. I was feeling real down on myself till I spoke with my mother, and she was in basically the same situation when she was my age and now she's retired and doing fine. Just hearing her story gave me a boost. It's a tough road we're on, but it's do-able. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I heard about a different case where a guy had some sort of compulsion about downloading images and burning them to CDs or something, usually he used some automated process on photo sites and never even looked at them. There was some CP among the pix and he got in serious trouble. Anyway, the guy in the OC seems to be targeting CP specifically, but in addition to that problem he probably has some compulsion issue as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In high school I liked to play chess, and one day a grandmaster came through town to play a couple of exhibitions. I was one of 10 people he played "blindfolded" -- we each sat at a chess board and he sat where he couldn't see the boards, and an intermediary went around to each board in turn and called out the move we'd made, he called out his reply, and so on. 

In this sort of event the master is bound to have a lapse in concentration at some point and make a big blunder that loses a game. By a stroke of luck it happened against me, and I was the only one of the 10 to win. I wasn't a very good player, just got lucky. Some of the other players were the best in the city, and he mowed them down without breaking a sweat.  </TEXT>

Most dissertations generate publications after graduation, not before, in part because the student is busy finishing the damn thing and doesn't have time to write up articles.

<TEXT> What /u/brilliantjoe said, plus many universities are cutting costs by hiring adjuncts (lecturers, instructors, "visiting" profs) instead of actual professors, or alternatively ditching adjuncts and making the profs take on more or larger classes. Either way it means there's a shrinking supply of decent jobs in the field. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Three publications as a degree condition is highly unusual IME. I could have graduated with no papers, and my colleagues in other disciplines had at most 1 publication required. 

Requiring so many publications is a rotten idea also because it increases the demand for places to publish, and tons of journals spring up, many of which are crap. That makes it harder to find the worthwhile research in the sea of mediocre-to-bad articles. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll second especially what /u/RedBugs said and others. I left my program after 7 years when my diss proposal wasn't accepted. I'd been at it too long to have come up with so little, so there was no point in continuing. Fortunately I had been applying for non-academic jobs just in case, partly because I wasn't sure I wanted to be a professor anyway. Two days after my proposal died I had my first job interview, and I got hired and started work within a few weeks. The pay isn't quite what I'd hoped, and I'll be dealing with student loans for a while, but as I look back I realize I'm doing work I like in the city where I've always wanted to live, and I doubt that would have happened so quickly if I'd gotten the degree. 

I'm already making more contacts in my non-academic field, and things are looking fairly bright from here. 

Oh, a word about grief and shame: They are both natural in your situation, and they suck, but you don't need to feel bad *about* having those feelings. It's like breaking up with your SO after 8 years. You'll feel a deep sense of loss for a while, then eventually things will get better. Not today, probably not tomorrow, but not too long from now.

One more thing: check with your school to see if they provide access to the services at [Versatile PhD](http://versatilephd.com/); their rasion d'etre is helping academics, both PhDs and ABDs, to find good careers in the "real world." You can pay for your own subscription if need be, and it may be worth it to you. I was lucky to get a job before I needed their services much, but I'm pretty impressed with their resources. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Been there. For some of us there's just some mental block about actually Getting It Done that we can't go around. I've heard it called Dissertation Paralysis. I talked a psychologist at my school into starting a support group for just that sort of thing, and (irony of ironies) it didn't get me over the hump, but a couple of other people in the group said they probably wouldn't have finished without it. 

One difficulty we face as PhD students is that "diss paralysis" is never talked about; either you're making progress or you're not, and the professors (who all *did* succeed so they may not "get it") have a limited set of ways to deal with it. I'm hoping that that support group, which is still up and running (and spawned at least one offshoot writing group), will lead to more openness and support in that area.

Once I recognized the diss paralysis problem for what it is I started talking it up at academic conferences. Some people seemed interested in learning more, because they do want to help the students finish and graduate, but it's still a ways from being seen as a normal thing that happens to many of us. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I suspect that most successful TV shows succeed because they create characters the audience can care about and relate to, so when they get into a not-too-original situation each episode it's still new-ish because we see how *these* characters respond. Sci-fi can make such characters, but since each episode "has" to have SF elements there's less opportunity to develop the characters or to put them in situations where they don't end up phase-blasting their way out. It can be done, but it's not easy.

BSG succeeded in part because early on it put a LOT of resources into world-building so that the writers could plausibly replicate just about any dramatic situation. "Labor strife, but in space." "Ethnic discrimination, but in space." "Rigged elections, but in space." They had much more range and didn't need as many old tropes as other series. </TEXT>

What also gets me is that the "official" T-shirts that people wear to the games and so forth are either burnt orange or ... hot pink. And groups of people on game days wear both. It's hideous. (I like burnt orange when it's paired with colors it works with, which unfortunately are few.) </TEXT>

The upshot is that the texting ban has to accompany a ban on all mobile-phone use or it's effectively impossible to enforce ("I wasn't texting, I was dialing!"), and the gains only last a few months without strong enforcement. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's no "real" difference between running and jogging; it's mainly how you see it. I don't call what I do "running" unless it's faster than 10:00/mile, but that's entirely me and applies to no one else; it's to motivate myself to get faster. 

Other folks will say jogging = recreation, running = trying to do well at races. Or (my favorite), fancy multifunction watch = running, otherwise jogging. Really, though, it doesn't matter what anyone calls it. We're all just doing what we can in the moment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> OK, best guess is you just need to keep at it and build endurance, since your pace doesn't seem to affect it much. Stick with the slower pace but try to go a bit farther this time than last time before resting, then repeat next time. Or think in terms of time instead of distance, and try to go a minute longer, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe you're running too fast during the running parts? It's way too easy to just charge out there, because dangit I'm *running* and that means going fast.

The rule I learned is, if you can't talk you're too fast, if you can sing you're not fast enough. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The best way to transition to barefoot-style running (whether literally barefoot or in minimalist shoes) is to learn the new motion bit by bit, and the best way to do that is [Hundred-Ups.](http://hundredup.com/) I do a set of these before every workout, even if it's not running, and it's helped tremendously. It will help your form even if you don't go the minimalist-shoe route. </TEXT>

Our lone star flag's the waviest

Our fried steak's the cream-graviest 

Our rattlesnakes the coiliest

Our beaches are the oiliest 

Our politicians most corrupt

Our stop signs most abrupt

Our guitars are the twangiest

Our guns are the ka-blangiest

Our cattle the long-horniest

Our yodels the forlorniest

Our cookoffs are the chiliest

Our Waylon is the Williest

Our sausage is the smokiest

<TEXT> Austin has two car-sharing services, Zipcar and Car2go, that have annual fees in the $30-40 range and then you pay per trip. In a pinch you can usually use one of them; it seems pricey at the time, every other day of the year you're not maintaining your own car, so unless you *have* to drive to the suburbs twice a week you come out ahead.

Another option is to get a scooter or motorcycle; you can park them lots of places on campus with a parking pass that's under $100. I love parking half a block from the library. </TEXT>

During the day, first choice is /u/bste2015's suggestion of the SSB's relaxation room. The study rooms at PCL may be full, but it's worth checking.

They gave everyone the same email password and put the word out that passwords wouldn't be changing for 45 days.

<TEXT> "Be yourself" is incomplete and confusing advice. A good, full version would be "Be true to yourself," which is more liberating. So if you want to talk to someone, you'd like them to feel at ease so they will engage you, and to do that, you put on a pleasant expression, for instance. You may not feel particularly good in the moment, but you truly want to enjoy their company, and thus you want them to enjoy yours. If you overdo it to the point you're just putting on a false front, that's another thing. 

Same with saying pleasant things even if you're not feeling good or charitable; you want the other person to hear what you're saying, really hear it and understand it, so you do what you can to say it in a way they'll listen to. Your instinct may be to say, for instance, "That's fucking bullshit," but you also know that the other person will just get defensive and dismiss your opinion, and that's not what you want.^1 If you say "Are you sure? What about ..." or some such, then your message will get through. You're working harder but being truer to yourself.

^1 (unless it is, in which case go for it) </TEXT>

<TEXT> The 2 is NOT a loser here. In fact, this particular suit is difficult to assess, because the number of spades you will lose depends on how the opponents' spades are distributed. If they each have 2, you can play the AK and collect them all and have no losers. If one opponent has Qxx, though, the Queen will take a trick, because after you win the AK the Queen will be the highest spade, and it will win one trick. (If the opponent who plays after the Jxxxx hand has QT98, then you have two losers. That's a distant possibility.)

Note that in each case, after you play the AK and, if necessary, play a third round to make them take their Queen, the rest of the spades are winners, not losers.

Remember that counting losers is only useful in a *suit* contract, because as soon as you're out of a suit, the next time the opponents play it you can win the trick by trumping. You can only do this if you have trump, though, so it's most useful to count losers in the hand with the longer trump holding.

So a loser is any card in a suit in the long-trump hand that you will have to lose before you can start trumping. So if your diamonds are Axx opposite Kxx, you know you can win the A and K, but you have to lose the third trick before you can trump their diamond plays, because you have to follow suit three times before you can use your trump.

So, sometimes (as with Axx opposite Kxx) you can count your losers in a suit right away, and sometimes (as with AKxxx opposite Jxxxx) you won't know for sure until you find out how the opps' cards are distributed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's partly the specific foods and partly the context: Using food to get those feelings unrelated to nutrition. Somewhere I saw a study that said addiction doesn't happen unless you go through all of these stages: Use, stop using, feel withdrawal, use to ease withdrawal feelings. Soon you get used to using those endorphins to deal with other kinds of stress.

I sometimes go back to something a friend told me, about someone he know who worked in an auto body shop, where they use paints that do bad things to your brain when you inhale their vapor. He'd drink heavily after work every day, and if you asked about it he'd say, "After a day with those chemicals I'm fucked up. Drinking is a fucked-up I can deal with."

Same with overeating. I've sometimes counted myself lucky that at least I eat instead of drinking to deal with stress, but that's just less bad, not good. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reminds me of a too-high-atop-the-pizza-parlor story. This is secondhand, but I have no reason to doubt it. When I was an assistant manager at a Pizza Hut, back when they all had those peaked red roofs, the story went around of a manager of one of the busiest PHs in the city who had decided that the attic space under the roof was the perfect place to go smoke weed after he got off work. It was summer, so it was pretty hot up there, and he stripped to his underwear. 

Now, there's a reason they always told us never to store things in the attic space: The "floor" isn't designed to hold weight. The manager was walking around up there, when he suddenly crashed through the floor *into the dining area* which was full of people eating. He got up, ran out the door (still in his underwear), and was never heard from again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Interesting, I take almost the opposite approach. I:

* don't use shampoo or soap above the neck, and my skin is nice and smooth and soft as a result.
* don't use shaving soap or cream. I don't even use water. I grab the razor as soon as I'm out of the shower and get to work. (This order is crucial; if I wait even 10 minutes, things get rough.) 
* only shave once; it's all that's needed.

It took a while before my skin got used to dry shaving, and in the meantime I experimented with oil instead of cream or soap; it worked fine, but it gunked up my razor. At some point I just wondered what would happen if I didn't use anything at all, so I tried it and liked it.

Possibly relevant: I use a double-edge safety razor, not one of those multiblade replaceable-head ones. It took a bit of getting used to, but now I wouldn't use anything else. One key is to be gentle and not use much pressure. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My best friend is an ex-GF. So is my second-best friend, come to think of it. No residual romance in either case, but we care about each other and are in touch pretty much every day.

I have some opposite-sex friends I find attractive who are not romantically available because of distance or being married or whatnot, but the attraction just adds a little glow to our interactions. I don't feel as if I'm missing out, because I like just having these people in my life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That may be the "right" thing to do, but we should harbor no illusions that anyone at the church will be swayed. [WBC is a Primitive Baptist Calvinist church](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/susan-kraus/westboro-baptist-church-rebecca-barrett-fox_b_4997296.html); its doctrine teaches that all people outside the church, and possibly some within it, are damned to eternal hellfire. Messages of kindness and love will sound to them like Charlie Brown's teacher -- Wa-wa-WA wa-wa wa-wa-WA.

I'm not saying we shouldn't take the high road; I'm saying that if we do, it's for our benefit and the benefit of others outside WBC. We just shouldn't fool ourselves about having an effect on the Phelpses themselves. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Any PRAW wizards in Austin? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi folks. I'm a grad student working on a project that involves downloading posts and comments from a couple of Reddit subs, and I'm a complete noob at Python and so on. I'm trying to self-teach, but it's slow going, and I need a boost.

So if anyone in Austin can meet me and show me how to do the stuff I need to do (or explain that it can't be done, though I'm confident it can) in PRAW and how to manage the output so it's in a form I can use, I'd be happy to pay for a lesson or two.

(My project isn't "about" scraping Reddit data, my adviser doesn't care how I get the stuff off the site, so this isn't a "do my homework for me" request.)

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I made my GF watch this one, because she had lost my car.

Kind of a long story, but I went out of town for a couple of weeks, and her car needed repairs so she used mine while it was in the shop, and when her car was ready she drove my car downtown to pick it up, intending to come back on the bus later to get my car, only she just plumb forgot, and didn't remember till days later. By that time it had been towed from the 2-hour lot, of course. She was appropriately apologetic and paid the fines, so no harm done. 

In fact she enjoyed the movie, unexpectedly considering what a guy flick it is, and so did I. Though our fun was probably enhanced by the absurdity of the previous events. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The [methodology section](http://scorecard.inrix.com/scorecard/methodology.asp) says, if I'm reading it right, that they take the road lengths into account -- that is, NYC drivers sit in traffic longer, but that's partly because they drive farther on average. So, say, a theoretical 10-minute drive that takes 30 minutes is more congested than a 20-minute drive that takes 50 minutes, by that measure. Again, if I'm reading it right. </TEXT>

<TEXT> People generally will only walk 1/4 mile to get to a bus stop. Guad to Congress is about a quarter-mile. That means that if someone wants to get somewhere east of Congress, they may decide the added distance is not worth the effort. 

Having the buses on Congress puts them closer to things people actually take the bus to get to. This will speed up traffic going *through* downtown, but trips going *to* downtown are another matter. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I read in a book once about an idea for a machine that could take your brain out of your body and fit both it and your body with transceivers so you'd keep functioning as your brain communicated with your body. 

So your body is outside the glass container holding your brain, and you think, "Here I am looking at my brain. Wow." Then you realize, "Wait, shouldn't I be thinking 'Here I am with my body looking at me'?"

I think the book was by Raymond Smullyan. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I lived a couple of blocks north of there for two years, and the distance was rarely a problem. Of course most of my classes were in the northwest corner of campus, so I didn't have far to go anyway.

If you can walk to 29th and Lamar, the 338 bus goes to the HEB at Hancock Center. (It may be shorter to walk to 24th and Lamar from where you'll be.) Also the 21 bus goes from the campus area to the Fiesta Mart at 38th and I-35, which is also a short walk under the highway from that same HEB. And Wheatsville Co-op is on Guad at 31st; it's a bit pricey on most items, but you can get some basics there without spending too much.

EDIT: Also, The 338, the 3, and the 22 (the same as the 21 only going the other way) also go to or near Central Market on North Lamar, which is basically an upscale HEB.  </TEXT>

For comparison, [here's](http://amarillo.craigslist.org/search/apa?catAbb=apa query= zoomToPosting= minAsk= maxAsk= bedrooms=1 housing_type=) what rents are like in Amarillo -- about 50% lower. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for doing this AMA. You might like this little Christmas story.

About 10 years ago about this time of year, I was visiting my mother in New York City. In December, tree vendors drive to the city from New England and other places, each with a truck full of trees, and set up shop at curbsides all over the city, selling their trees till they run out. 

My mother has a small apartment and doesn't normally get a tree. One day I was walking past a tree seller and saw that he had taken some little branches about a foot or so long that had fallen from the larger trees, stuck each one into a piece of wood for a base, and put them next to a sign that said "Charlie Brown trees, $3." Naturally I couldn't resist, so I bought one and took it home, and my mother loved it. It stayed healthy-looking through the holidays. 

So thanks to you and your husband for this and other additions to our culture. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 50 here. I figured out early on that I lack the patience for having kids, and never really felt the urge. I like that I can make decisions that affect only me -- I've made good and bad, but the bad ones only hurt myself. No regrets. These are my priorities and mine alone; if yours are different, I'm behind you 100%. I'm happy to leave the child-rearing to people who want to do it and are reasonably good at it. </TEXT>
