<TEXT> I just immediately opened this link in Safari and saved the image so I could share it with like 17 different people(ok, maybe 3 people). Can I just delete my Reddit account and open a new one so that I can tell everyone a year from now that this was the image that brought me to Reddit? This is probably my favorite thing I have seen on here, so far. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your mother's behavior sounds extremely erratic. I really think that maybe your dad should push seeing a psychologist or something along those lines. If she has never been like this before, yet all of the sudden is so mean and unsupportive, there could be some much deeper issues going on. I am in NO WAY condoning her behavior. It makes me sick to think that a mother could be that demeaning and evil towards her own child and their spouse. I just think that maybe she could have developed some mental issues that need to be handled by a professional. However, I highly suggest that you have your Dad push the issue of seeing a professional. Until she can control her ludicrous behavior, I that you and your wife should cut off all contact from her. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Excuse me... A human. I don't see how it is fair to take that HUMAN'S life. I have been in the "young and irresponsible pregnant girl" place. Now I have a beautiful 8 year old daughter. It isn't my place to have decided whether or not she got to develop from some cells into an actual baby. I wasn't ready to be a mother, but I figured it out.  Honestly, I had to grow up quickly... But I would never go back and change it. I will NEVER agree with abortion. Sorry if you don't agree with me.  That is the joy of being a human and not just a clump of developing cells that doesn't get a say in anything. 

Rant done.  </TEXT>
