<TEXT> I love it. I've lived in several parts of the country as my dad was in the military and when he retired we moved here.  None of the places weve lived in can compare to East Tennessee.  Depending on where you live you have the best of both city life and country life. Southern hospitality isn't a myth, everyone treats you better here. It's a great place to live. And actually I just transferred to Middle Tennessee State University last year so I'm right here outside of Nashville when school is in session. I think choosing to live between the two places would definitely depend on several factors but if you want the option to have a quiet secluded life (with a view) East Tennessee is the place. Also,  not that I'm saying your life has to be secluded in a place like East Tennessee, because it doesn't. You just have that option if you want it. Hope that helps!  </TEXT>

I've live here for about 10 years and haven't really figured out if there is a defined landscape that makes a holler a holler or if the places they call holler are just called that because the road names are named such. For example "hog hollow rd" is a road name in this county and that area is generally referred to as hog holler.  </TEXT>
