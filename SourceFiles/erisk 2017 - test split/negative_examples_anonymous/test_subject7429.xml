<TEXT> All I can say is wow. Jake Gyllenhaal is unrecognizable from his character in Nightcrawler and did a phenomenal job which just goes to show the range he can achieve. While the plot is a little predictable, the movie really is great and the performances are very believable (especially from the daughter, Oona Laurence). On a final note, James Horner's score was amazing and really added to the feel of the whole movie. As someone who's not really into sports films, this movie really was wonderful and I recommend you all go see it if you get the chance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My laptop says it's connected and some sites (like reddit) are loading, but almost all of them just load for a minute and then time out. I just did all the driver updates my computer said it had, restarting, scanning for malware, and checking my most recent installations, and I can't really think of anything else to look for. This on my school's Internet and I checked my friends computer and it loaded everything just fine, so I don't think it's a problem with the school. I'm using windows 7, Intel i7-4810. If you need to know anything else, just ask. Thanks for any help.

Edit: I forgot to mention that my computer says my connection is fine and a speed test says I am getting 15 Mbps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hchste Kaiser has given the Overseer of Kaliningrad permission to begin a three year project to expand Kaliningrad's ports in order to increase trade and tourism. To put it simply, there will be more docks to accommodate more trade and tourist ships and also newer docks to hold larger ships. We will also be expanding the shipyards to increase the output of ships built in Kaliningrad. We hope that this will improve Kaliningrad's economy and allow us to connect with more countries through trade all over the world. </TEXT>

He will be taking a similar role as the Hchste Kaiser, only he will be reporting to and taking direction from his father. His job will consist of taking care of smaller legislation, overseeing the economy, and commanding the military within Kaliningrad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> After years and years of construction, planning, and various delays, the wall around the country has finally been completed. The wall itself stands at fifty feet and the top is lined with artillery, mounted guns, and soldiers. There are several access points into the country all throughout the wall with military checkpoints. Finally Liechtenstein has the safety its citizens have always deserved. Everyone may note, that this is not a closing of the borders like last time, but simply a (extremely expensive) safety precaution. Glory to Liechtenstein!

<TITLE> [Event] Liechtenstein asks EMU to intervene in conflict </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Liechtenstein is asking the EMU for help/intervention since this declaration of war by Poland, another EMU member, is unjust. Tuva ceded Kaliningrad to Liechtenstein fairly. If Poland had indeed been in negotiations with both the former NSF and Tuva (which Liechtenstein was unaware of) they obviously saw the nation as unfit to lead the territory and chose not to cede it to them or else they would already have it. Liechtenstein tried to make agreements with Poland upon hearing about their interest in Kaliningrad and they took the first deal. I request that Poland be removed from the EMU and other member nations help Liechtenstein in this conflict.

<TEXT> As leader of Liechtenstein, I am taking this moment to formally announce the conclusion of negotiations for the joining together of our two regions! Kaliningrad will remain the name of the Capitol, but the exclave itself will be Knigsberg. In recent years, the economy and population of Knigsberg have been falling, but Liechtenstein is hoping to boost its economy by making it Liechtenstein's center for overseas trade. On top of that, we will also be taking advantage of its amber deposits, fishing, boat, and auto industry, and tourism to boost the economy as well.

Liechtenstein has also made a deal with Poland to insure safe passage of goods to and from our ports in exchange for a percentage of goods that enter and leave the area. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Liechtenstein would like to negotiate the annexation of Kaliningrad Oblast since it is an exclave and not connected to the main land of Russia.

Its name will most likely become the previous name of its capital, Knigsberg while the capital will remain Kaliningrad. 

Its population sits at just over 940,000 at the moment and its GDP is about US$14,000 per capita. Unfortunately, both have been falling. Liechtenstein hopes to reverse this buy boosting investors and helping with overall quality of life.

The population is currently 86% Russian with the rest being made up of various Eastern European demographics. 

We hope to make use of its ice-less ports and make it Liechtenstein's center for sea trade. We also hope to utilize its tourism, amber deposits, fishing industry, and boat and auto manufacturing to continue to boost its own economy and help our own. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The aircraft will take off and land vertically, but the rotors will be able to turn to allow the aircraft to maneuver and move quickly.  When the rotors have been turned a full 90 degrees the aircraft is predicted to be able to reach speeds of over 100 knots, however, the horizontal speed isn't the main goal. The main goal is to have a veihicle that can hover and provide air support and recon in combat zones and be able to arrive and leave the combat zone quickly along with being stealthier than current VTOLs (Sort of a get in, get out type vehicle). The aircraft will be piloted by two men and be armed with a 20 mm Gatling gun at the nose and hold eight MIRV-style rockets for anti-armor and building attacks. More information will be released as research continues. So far the research is expected to take between eighteen months and two years. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Liechtenstein and France are proud to announce the completion of their newest advancement in military technology! After some setbacks, the fully customizable Titan Infantry Armor is being mass produced and used by France and Liechtenstein and is for sale for approximately US$5,000 per suit.

Quick description: The armor is made of a weave of spectra fiber and Kevlar, is made up of paintable panels on a suit that can be added or removed for added mobility/protection, and the armor is fully customizable to the wearer's ability. The second part of the armor is the helmet. It is made of the same materials, covers the entire head, features an HUD that displays location, weapon, and other information, an eye piece with zooming, night vision, and other abilities, and can be fitted with a gas mask and oxygen supply.

Once again, each suit is also available for export to any country under any specification and will arrive combat-ready for US$5,000 or more depending on specs.

Today, though, the great leader of Liechtenstein reopened the borders for public travel and immigration! Hchste Kaiser was asked what made him finally decide to reopen and was quoted saying, "I forgot to open them after a few months..." 

Well, today anyone with a passport may now enter Liechtenstein for whatever reason they please, be it the scenery, our famous jam covered women, or simply to worship our wonderful leader!

<TITLE> [Event] Liechtenstein's bunker is finally finished! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-28 19:39:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Liechtenstein's 6+ year effort, the former subway station turned bunker is finally complete! This bunker is, for now, to be used for research and storage of government rations, weapons, vehicles, etc., but its true purpose is in fact a shelter in the event of a nuclear holocaust/meteor strike/other threat to all life on earth. Due to Liechtenstein's small population, the bunker is equipped to sustain a good portion of Liechtenstein's citizens for years. 

Guarded by a large blast-proof gate, it is equipped with living quarters, water purifiers, air filters, environment suits, research and medical facilities, a command center, and more. Despite Liechtenstein's readiness, we truly hope that this bunker's true purpose is never actually needed. The bunker is also equipped with office space and storage facilities for Mann Co. Liechtenstein will always be willing to expand the bunker to make space for any country that is willing to pay and aide in the development. 

The bunker is also home to a large meeting room and living quarters to allow for lengthy meetings between multiple world leaders to discuss business in a much safer and more private setting. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Event] Liechtenstein begins researching new armor for soldiers </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-26 21:46:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Liechtenstein and France have begun planning a new type of lightweight armor for military personnel. The armor will be made of a light plating sections attached to a suit. The material being used is a weave of spectra fiber and Kevlar. The plates will be separated along the suit to allow for easy mobility, but it'll be possible to add plates for situations where less mobility and more armor are necessary.  If this is successful, the armor ahould be able to resist a moderate amount of small arms fire and withstand anything less. The plates will also be camouflaged to allow for tactical use in any environment. The armor itself will be able to be upgraded and customized as the wearer sees fit.

Along with the suit, we will also be developing a helmet made of the same materials that covers the entire head and face of the soldier. These helmets will be fitted with a radio, a heads up display displaying information on the location (elevation, coordinates, temperature, etc.), an eye piece that allows for night vision, thermal, telescopic, etc., and in some cases, the helmets will be fitted with an oxygen supply. More information will be released if more research is deemed necessary.

This research is expected to take, if all goes according to plan, around 18 months.

As usual, this technology will be available for export upon completion and beginning of mass production.

Edit: some more stuff </TEXT>

These lightly armored vehicles are capable of conquering even the roughest of terrain at a moderate speed in any weather. With brand new tire, shock, and suspension technology, this vehicle can go through much rougher terrain for longer periods of time than the older models. This vehicle will be able to hold up to 7 people, can support weapons attachments to the top of the vehicle, and is prepped for all environments. Liechtenstein is currently ready to mass produce and export to any country with any specifications. Average price per unit will be ~US$600,000. Currently only Liechtenstein and France hold the rights to build the AT-23 Spectre. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-05-12 05:06:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Welcome to your yearly programming of Hchste Kaiser's Word 2021! We're your new news team!

To start things off, the reason why we're here. At the beginning of the year, our great leader personally executed the previous mess team upon finding evidence that they were leaking confidential information to the terrorist organization that was attacking the country and other nations. He ended the executions stating that betrayal will never be tolerated.

On a lighter note, Liechtenstein announced the plans for its very own car company this year! So far all we know is that Kaiserwagen will be selling all over the world and will include cars of all types.

Next, the terrorist organization that had been attacking innocent civilians and government facilities has finally been out down. A defector informed The government of the organization's location and, upon further investigation, SHIT squads were sent in and all terrorists were either killed or captured. The next month after questioning, all captured members were personally executed by Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429. The organization's leader was never named.

Continuing military news, the government revealed its intentions to design and mass produce a new military all terrain vehicle. The vehicle is being designed in collaboration between Loechtenstein and France and is expected to begin mass production within this next year. Designs have yet to be released.

On a much sadder note, our great leader revealed that he had, until recently, forgotten his own title. And then, to add insult to injury, Hchste Kaiser offered diplomatic relations to a leader that was no longer in power. The whole country joined our great leader to wallow in depression for a few days.

Well, that wraps it up for Hchste Kaiser's Word, your only choice in Liechtenstein news. Tune in next year.

We hope for a lightly armored vehicle that can hold at least six men and support attachable firearms. These vehicles will, in theory, be able to maneuver Liechtenstein's mountainous terrain much easier than our current vehicles. Along with the vehicles, Kaiserwagen will be researching a new form of tire that will be more durable and last much longer in the rough terrain. Liechtenstein is accepting help with designs and has plans to export to anyone that inquires. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Today, Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 personally executed every captured member of the terrorist organization that had formerly been attacking innocents for well over a year. After the capture of their leader and the disbanding of the group, they were kept away from the public and questioned for just over a month. Early this morning, a verdict was reached and it was announced that they were all to be executed. At noon, all men, looking battered and beaten, were lined up and, one by one, shot by our eternal leader. The final execution was that of the organization's leader. His name was never released to the public. Hchste Kaiser explained right after executing the man that his name will never be public knowledge because, "He did not deserve the satisfaction of a legacy." </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is with great joy that I personally announce the end of the never-named terrorist group that attacked facilities and civilians all over the country. With the help of a defector from the group, we located their base of operations and SHIT squads were immediately sent in. The group was found to be much smaller then we had anticipated, just over 50 members. 

SHIT squads were met with gunfire upon entry and the majority of the group was killed in the ensuing firefight. The remaing 17 members, the still-anonymous leader included, were captured and taken to an undisclosed location for interrogation. Once questioning is through, punishment will be dispatched posthaste. Terrorism and betrayal to the nation won't nor will it ever be tolerated and the punishments these men receive will be just and deserved.

I personally invite all citizens of our great nation to celebrate with me. On this momentous day, a group of murderers was put to an end. Finally, we can rest and our country can return to the prosperity it knew before.

The execution was done by pistol and carried out personally by the nation's leader. After the execution he stated that betrayal to the country in any form will not be tolerated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Liechtenstein is doing nothing. We had no property in space. 

In other news, the terrorist cell currently attacking unarmed civilians and government buildings has begun spreading its demands across the Internet. They are calling for a stop to the construction of the Wall and reopening of the nation's borders. The group claims to be making these demands in order to stop what they foresee to be a rapid downfall in the country's economy that they fear will have a large and irreparable effect on Liechtenstein's people. The still nameless group had threatened to continue the attacks until their demands are met. Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 has yet to make a public acknowledgement to the terrorists' demands.

<TEXT> In the last couple of months there have been three more terrorist explosive attacks. One on a military training facility and two in busy public areas. Liechtenstein's original ideas on the size of this group are either too small or the group is in much deeper than the government originally anticipated. Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 has dispatched multiple SHIT squads and even sent some private agents to various areas to investigate these attacks. 

The entire country's militarization has had little affect on the terrorist attacks as they have all been carried out by lone men and been swift and without warning. 

Hchste Kaiser has voiced his outrage at the terrorists' willingness to harm unarmed civilians and directly disrespect his own rule over the country. He has stated that he will not stop until the group's leader and all of its members are killed or captured and that he is willing to take drastic measures to do so.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-04-28 14:55:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> (I was busy yesterday)

Hchste Kaiser's third year as the supreme general of our great nation has been quite eventful. An attempted terrorist attack took place at the capital building while Hchste Kaiser was meeting with all of his officials. Luckily, the explosive malfunctioned and wasn't able to detonate. Turkey was able to supply intelligence that told us that this isn't a single man's idea, but a group effort. The terrorist is still being interrogated for information.

On a brighter side, our great leader recently started a new program for the military elite. The SHIT program will include the best if the best soldiers from both Liechtenstein and France. These SHIT Squads will be used as Hchste Kaiser's personal guard and in missions considered to dangerous for the average soldier or police officer. Hopefully, once the program releases the first groups from training, a terrorist attack like the one mentioned will become much more difficult to execute.

In more recent news, our wonderful leader sent delegates to the Vorarlberg region of Austria to negotiate an annexation. If Austria's own annexation of another area comes to fruition, then Vorarlberg may well become the newest addition to our great nation. These negotiations also led to an alliance between the two countries.

In other news, the construction of the Wall is going as planned, but, sadly, the **subway station's** construction has been haulted until further notice. And finally, Texas finally gave Hchste Kaiser his money back. When asked about the country's new leader, /u/test_subject7429's only response was, "Who? Oh, s***! I'm late for my banjo lessons. Get out!"

This concludes your only choice in yearly news. We thank you for choosing Hchste Kaiser's Word, even though you have no other option.

All news dictated but not read by Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429

During a meeting with his parliament, a large car rammed itself through the front doors of the building and the driver attempted to detonate an explosive in the vehicle. Thankfully, the explosive didn't detonate and the bomber was captured. He is currently in custody and being questioned. Hopefully this was an individual attack and not a group effort.

<TEXT> With the return of Liechtenstein's money, the construction of the Great Wall of Liechtenstein will begin as planned in January of next year. However, without the help of the former dictator of Texas, a completion date is still unknown. But do not worry, people.  The continuity of this great nation is still of utmost importance to me.

<TITLE> [News] Hchste Kaiser's Word 2018 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-04-20 15:48:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This year has been a stressful one for the great leader of Liechtenstein. The panic cause by the meteorite impact in Northern Africa forced Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 to close the border to all but the most important persons and events. Despite the crisis being solved, the leader remains cautious and has yet to reopen the borders to the rest of the world.

In other news, a **subway system** began construction. Everyone is extremely excited for the **subway** and hopes to be able to **travel the country quickly and in comfort** soon. Sadly the **subway** does not yet have a definite completion date, but stay tuned! 
(*Disclaimer*: **subway system** is definitely **not** a military bunker.)

On the topic of construction, the leader of our great nation also began construction of the Great Wall of Liechtenstein. This wall will surround the entire country and be fully armed with soldiers, artillery, etc. Sadly, did to the recent change in leadership in Texas, the previously expected help in building the wall seems to no longer be the case. This unexpected delay has caused this project, too, to no longer have an expected completion date.

On a related note, Hchste Kaiser expects Texas to, "Give me my money back. Like, now, guys. I mean... Come on."

Lastly, Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 has named the raspberry as Liechtenstein's national fruit. All citizens are now required to consume at least one raspberry every 6 hours in accordance with the laws set by the recently passed Freaking Delicious Act of 2018.

This concludes your once a year news source Hchste Kaiser's Word. Tune in next year for your only choice in Liechtenstein news!

Stay tuned for Sing-Along Disney Songs with Hchste Kaiser /u/test_subject7429 </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Liechtenstein has begun construction of an underground **subway.** This amazing **transportation system** will run throughout the entire country and **be able to transport the citizens of Liechtenstein all over the country**! This is **in no way** a military base or a vault or anything of the sort! As a sneak peak, I am willing to say that the new **subways** will feature extremely large 3 ft thick gates that will stand around 20 ft high and be able to be withstand even the most powerful of **train collisions**! Isn't that fantastic? The **subway system** will also be going hundreds of feet below ground with multiple levels to **allow for more trains and routes**! Wow! To give you people an idea about the size, it may or may not be able to hold the majority if not all of the citizens of Liechtenstein in the event of a great **celebration** so everyone will be able to **party together**! Amazing! We anticipate that this **subway system** will be complete in a matter of 3-4 years and then **everyone** will be **allowed** to **ride the trains all over the country**!

<TEXT> After reports of a multitude of people secretly entering the great nation of Liechtenstein despite the heavily enforced closed border rulings, I have decided that in order to keep the peace and integrity and ensure the defense and safety of this perfect nation and its citizens, a barrier must be built. The wall will stand 50 feet tall, be heavily defended, and surround the entire nation. This decision is not one made easily, but must happen in order to ensure the safety of my nation and its people in these unpredictable times.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The newest leader of the great nation of Liechtenstein began his eternal term this year rather successfully. He was able to bring the country's military strength up well over what was necessary. When questioned, the Hchste Kaiser responded, "What the hell does 'moderation' mean?" The nation's great leader was then given a dictionary and, upon reading the definition, had the reporter publicly executed.

As of now, the nation's borders are still closed due to the bacterial crisis in Africa and will only be opened for reasons of the utmost importance.

In other news, the Hchste Kaiser has said that he won't nor will he ever recognize Duck Rights.

That's all for now, but tune in next year for Hchste Kaiser's Word. You're only choice in Liechtenstein national news.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Do you have to keep putting cars back into the garage (mainly the 4 car ones)? I've noticed that if I took one out and didn't put it back in or it got destroyed, it would no longer be saved in the garage. This happened 3 times (once in franklin's/aunt's house garage, once in Trevor's 4-car garage, and once in michael's 4-car garage) and I'm wondering if it's a glitch or the game is supposed to be like that. </TEXT>
