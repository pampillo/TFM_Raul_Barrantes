Before he even started actually doing the stuff they were truly angry about, like talking about torture, Gitmo, gay rights, DADT, and healthcare.

And now you're angry at everyone for not jumping on your bandwagon.  We hated the last CEO towards the end of her tenure after she did a bunch of stupid shit.  This guy hasn't even done anything yet.  Nothing.

Oh wait, he talked about doing something.  Totally the same thing, my bad. </TEXT>

So, if I have a $100 bankroll, I bet a flat 10% on my bets.  But that doesn't mean that my unit is $10, right?  Cause that 10% will cause the bet amount to change daily.

<TEXT> I want to use this shake as a meal replacement, but not for all three meals, like the website suggests.  Maybe one or two meals a day.

My question is, is this too good to be true?  All the nutrients we need for a keto diet in a simple shake?  There's not uch information on the website, so I don't know where else to turn.  Asking the company itself to critique their product seems counter productive.

When I said I was disappointed in HBO's writers, it was in comparison to their own work, not others.  They've set such a high standard for themselves, I felt that they didn't live up to expectations.

It's the old Soviet factory problem.  If you work too hard, the boss expects more of you each time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've read some material saying that keto is ok for diabetics, and people with kidney stones are not in any danger on this diet.  But those seemed to be opinion pieces.

Are there any hard scientific sources supporting a ketogenic lifestyle for someone with kidney stones who is borderline diabetic?

My neighbor fits into this category, and I don't want to give him wrong information.  He's been making great progress, but he told me he is pre-diabetic, has kidney stones, and gets occasional gout flareups.

He's so far done it by plain old calorie restriction, but now he wants to cut out carbs all together. </TEXT>

People will willingly work themselves to death to provide for their loved ones.

My mother worked two retail jobs to provide for her three children.  My father, still at age 70, drives 2 hours to work and back to support my mother and himself in their retirement years.  I send them whatever money I can from my own paycheck.  Their health is definitely affected.

What, pray tell, are their options? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have  a 2010 Legacy, which I love, but wanted to see about trading it in for the 2015 model.  Basically, there is nothing new here.  A little bluetooth here, some rear camera there, and that's it.  I thought that a 5 year break in between models would offer significant upgrades, or at least changes.  Everything seems the same, or just negligibly improved.  Even the gas mileage is the same.  NO IMPROVEMENTS TO MPG IN 5 YEARS?  No other car company has stagnated like that.

I guess I'll keep this one for another 120,000 miles. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a former muslim, I can confidently say that Islam is exactly like that.  There is a very popular hadith that pretty much itemizes how one gets into heaven.  

First, you have to physically and outwardly be religious.
If you can't accomplish that, you must at least be inwardly religious and god fearing.
If you can't do that or are another religion, there's still hope!!  All you have to do is believe in the one-ness of god, regardless of what name you call him by.
If you can't accomplish this, perhaps missionaries were unable to reach you with the holy message in time, then you can still get into heaven.  All you have to do is have an ounce of goodness in you. (pretty vague, right?)

So, not so unique, eh? </TEXT>

<TEXT> a relatively successful internet message board

Either you're trolling with intentional density or you weren't around when major events happen on Reddit.  The Presidents of the United States, as well as many other countries have come on to do AMAs on this website.  Politicians, movie star, musicians, and revolutionaries have used this site as a platform for launching bigger projects.  But yeah, Reddit is relatively successful, I guess. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry about that.
I'm in the U.S., and honestly would look to move anywhere.  Third world countries are doable for me.

I'm interested in any kind of job, really.  I'm stuck in a dead end job at the moment, with absolutely no prospects of advancements, in one of the most expensive markets in the country.  I will not be able to save money if I live here long term.

My work experience is varied, but always with small business.  I started out with a small computer store, which did mainly tech support and custom machines.  I worked for a medical equipment company, and now am in the jewelry business.  Basically, everywhere I went, I helped the company grow by actively taking a management role with a lot of responsibilities under me.  I ended up leaving each company because they were family businesses.  The problem is, that this is all I know how to do now.  I have no corporate or government experience what so ever.

I speak English and Urdu fluently.  But I am only literate in English.  I would definitely be willing to learn a new language for the right opportunity.

<TEXT> Holy shit, this would suck major donkey balls.  I've been to Skaagway, Alaska a few times, and I thought that was a tiny hell hole.  Literally one main street that goes for three or four blocks.  A few blocks for residents, and one block for shops that cater to the cruise ships.

Town population with all the seasonal employees during may, june, july, and august is around 800.  That drops to half that in the offseason.  Which always makes me wonder:  what do the people who stay during the winter actually do, since tourism is the economic driving force? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just be flexible, but dont allow yourself to be walked over. I had a baseball commish that was hell bent on having a defensive stat, so he started the league with an 'errors' category. After years of complaining from the other 11 owners, hr unilaterally changed it to another defensive category. The other owners wanted to eliminate the category, but he wouldn't even consider having a vote. Six owners ended up leaving the league after almost a decade in.

On the other extreme, I had a commish who would just implement whatever rules were suggested by two particular owners. We ended up with ppr, points per rushing attempt, points per passes completed, extra points for yac yards, and 8 defensive starting positions.

Both if these types of commissioners suck the enjoyment out of the game

The reason why we are so few in number is because those of us not public with our apostasy fear for our lives from bible thumping (quran thumping) muslims who genuinely believe we should die for our own personal choice.

<TEXT> I haven't been doing it consistently.  But 20 years ago, I started leading and I had no choice, since I was a minor.  As I grew older, and my balls got bigger, I started refusing.  First passive aggressively by taking night classes in college that directly conflicted with taraweeh schedules.  Then, as I got a job later on, I would just tell people I didn't feel like it.  If people really pressured me into it, and it would seem like there might be some blowback to  my parents in terms of ostracizing, then I'll begrudgingly do it.

But I've garnered a reputation as kind of a smart ass that talks back and correct everybody's bullshit pseudo science opinions on Quranic miracles, so now they only come to me when they're desperate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here is a breakdown from urser /u/twewy

[Dude, that opener + combo was a work of art.
Right feint, left ready, sees the guard go up, shoves the left in there, follows it up a combo to make sure he can't afford to put his guard down, right hook, left hook, right uppercut, left -- just kidding! Right hook. Change it up, make your opponent frustrated and impatient.
Tattoo man wants to look, he wants to peek, you don't take six hits blind with nothing to show for it. Ben waits for the peek, and shoves another left in there, this time an uppercut, following with an opportune right hook to take advantage of the weakened guard as it moves inward, over compensating for the uppercut that was just received.
Tattoo man realizes his mistake, and solidifies his guard again -- but wait, we've seen this pattern before! You don't win fights in a ball guarding all day!
Ben's been building this guy up. Tattoo man hasn't gotten a single SWING out, let alone a solid hit. Ben knows he'll want to make a move soon, so he pauses, just for half a second. Where previously he had driven half a dozen punches in to make sure no room was given, he waits this time. Ben knows the timing perfectly. Tattoo man takes the bait, there, the guard is dropping, right arm is swinging back, this is going to be big, but fatally slow to start! Ben's faster, he already sees how this will play out. Duck and weave, quick left disrupts the knock out haymaker, veers it off course, and the motion he's practiced thousands of times puts him under now-wild right. Tattoo man hits air, can't adjust his momentum, he's vulnerable, he's open! Bam, right hook straight into the jaw, lights out. Insurance left misses, target's already down.
TL;DR Ben's a cold-hearted, calculating bastard.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/2xzs0z/how_acting_tough_can_get_you_knocked_out_in_20/cp50xkj) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Chris Weidman's freakish reach </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-14 15:16:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 78"

I think this might be the factor that gives him his greatest advantage over his opponents in the middleweight division.  His reach measures a ridiculous 78", which a lot of heavyweights don't even have.  Similar to Jon Jones, he is extremely successful at using his freakish body to keep people away.  No one in the MW even comes close.  Hell, even Cain Velasquez only measures 77".  People clamoring on about how Machida, Mousassi, and Belfort will destroy this guy seem to forget what JJ did to two of those guys (And I'm a diehard Machida fanboy).

Will Weidman have the same success as JJ?  Who knows.  Jones' greatest asset is his intelligence in the cage and his ability to adapt to opponents mid fight.  Weidman seems to be able to do that so far.  His striking still looks weird and sloppy to me, but he's got a fantastic coach that is continuously refining that aspect of his game.  His wrestling prowess is already known.  The only unknown seems to be his submission game, and like Jones, we haven't seen him in a position to be submitted yet.

Am I talking out of my ass?  Who knows?  Probably.  But does anyone else think that his incredible genetics will keep him at the top for a while?  Why or why not?  If I'm making a stupid argument, please break it down and call me a noob or whatever.  But until someone convinces me otherwise, I'm hellbent on believing that his 78" arms are gonna hold on to that belt for a little bit. 

I'm not saying that reach is everything, but Jones' dominance stems from his ability to use it effectively, and so far, Weidman seems to be learning from JJ's sucsess.

Anderson Silva's reach was also a ridiculous 77.6".


Cain Velasquez: 77"

Cigano: 77"

Travis Browne:  80"

Bigfoot:  82"

**Jon Jones: 84"**

Rashad:  75"

Phil Davis:  79"

Gus:  79"

Machida:  74"

I personally think he could benefit from a Machida camp.  If anyone knows how to not get bullied by wrestlers, that's the guy.  I don't think I've ever seen Machida grinded against the cage like Cigano was last night.

Or if not Machida, then perhaps a Munoz camp?

Obviously he doesn't have Machida's ground game, but is it fair to say that his standup is an aggressive Machida style? </TEXT>

I'm not in title contention, and I've stocked up on draft picks for next year.  I just need a 3B to finish out this year.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is literally the worst time to do so.  Your friends and family are going to be more religious than ever, and this will cause a greater chasm to form between you and them.  We all know, and have experienced, how even the most even keeled liberal muslims go batshit crazy during Ramadan.  Because of the fake nature of Islamic spirituality, you really have to pick and choose the right times to fight the right battles.  Ramadan is not the right time.  Neither is Hajj season.  Stay away from those two events on the calendar when making life altering proclamations to your family.

<TEXT> Is this the USA network's attempt at a gritty corrupt cop drama like FK's "The Sheild?"  Because if it is, I don't think they will succeed.  If they want to stick to their USA formula for dramas like Burn Notice, and Cover Affairs, they'll be alright.  But trying to go gritty when you have no clue is just unwatchable television.  A lot like TNT's failed cop drama two years ago with Dylan McDermott called "Dark Blue" or "Deep Blue" or something like that. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Question for the ex-Shia Muslims (ex-muslim shias?) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-06-22 18:22:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Yes, Wazzym's x-post piqued my interest.

My question is, what are some of core beliefs in Shia Islam that diverge from orthodoxy?  When I ask sunnis, I obviously get biased answers like "kafirs, heretics, blasphemers, blah blah blah"

From my very brief reviews of various writings, it seemed that Shias were a little more objective in their treatment of the prophets companions and wives, and didn't hold them up to "saintly" status.

I understand the Imams and all that nonsense.  I want to know more about their views on hadith, the sahabas, and wives or the prophet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> THIS IS NOT A DEFENSE OF THE WORD MUZZIE.

I'm trying to get actual answers through discussion.  I don't want to turn this into ZI's defense testimony.  I don't want a referendum on political correctness.  I just want people's opinions on this specific question.

I've had this conversation with only one redditor so far, and we were able to keep it civilized, so hopefully the 
same can be expected of everybody else.

edit:  please let's not turn this into an /r/atheism "socrates died for our memes" type issue.  I just want to know how people feel about this ONE question. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I brought up a Las Vegas meetup before.  Most of the meetups are localized to big cities, so those of us in the boondocks can't really go.  

But if we were to have a destination vacation type meetup, people would have plenty of time to prepare, and we could have shit loads of fun.  Plus, most summer cities are cheap as hell this time of year, like Vegas, because of the weather.

Does anyone have any real interest in this, or am I just high?  (I'm not high.....yet) </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of which was blatant misogyny.  When we talk about the women who follow islam being misguided and acting against their own benefit, we aren't being sexist.  We (at least I) are talking from a place of pain, after watching our mothers, sisters, and wives fall victim to this brainwashing.  Calling out that bullshit on this sub is not misogyny.  It is venting.  We have no where else to talk about it, because no one else understands where we are coming from.

No other apostates from any other religion in the world have experienced the gender inequality that we experienced/participated in as muslims.  This is a huge point of frustration and anger for us.  So please, SRS, don't come into this sub and tell us how we should feel and/or act about this.  This is not your sub, it is ours. 

I can't speak for everyone, but I'll tell you how I feel about muslim women.  I feel the same way about them as Liberal democrats feel about poor rednecks who protest against Obamacare.  People who are opposing their own interest/well being/safety.  Islam is not safe for women.  I personally feel that muslim women are brainwashed into believing the exact opposite.  I have the right to these beliefs, and I have the right to share them without being called a misogynist.  So take your overly politically correct sensitivity training back to SRS, and stay out of our business.

Are my feelings coming from a source of male privelage?  No.  They come from knowing the freedom of experiencing how wonderful life is without the soul crushing and life defeating menace that is Islam.  It ruined my life.  It is currently ruining my mother's life, and that of my sisters and female cousins. 

Is there anyting you SRSers don't get mad about?  If I talk negatively about women who don't see the harm they subject themselves to, I'm a misogynist.  If I talk negatively about muslim transgressions and abuses, I'm an Islamophobe.  What exactly is the name of your world, where everybody loves everybody, and religions respect each other and don't cause hardship to women and conflict all over the world?

Just leave us alone.


edit:  I apologize for the overly possesive "our sub, not yours" comment.  Of course all are welcome here, but the discussions shouldn't deviate from this sub's purpose, IMO. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2013-05-14 20:09:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A golf buddy of mine says he is trying out a new swing that has him keep all his weight on his left leg throughout the entire swing.  He says it helps him with balance, and he is getting more distance from it.

He advised me to try this swing, since I'm still relatively raw in my skill (best score 97).

Have any of you played around with this swing(Balance on left leg almost entirely instead of even distribution)?

I've been told that for short shots around the green, this is great for not losing balance and hitting the ball in every which direction, he is insisting that this should be done on longer shots as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's disgusting.  On the one hand, muslims and their apologists throw out their "NTS" arguments, and in the same breath, claim that man cannot judge another man's intentions, and only God can judge.

It's hard to believe that they are typing the words out, reading them, and actually seeing no contradictory hypocrisy there.

AAAHHH.  MAAAAAY.  ZIIING.

<TITLE> I am looking for a very specific copy of the Quran [more inside] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-04-11 20:40:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The copy I am looking for is published by a prominent Pakistani company, whose name I can't remember.  This company's Quran publications are used in madrasas all over Pakistan and some parts of India.

Of particular note, this version contains 16 lines per page, as opposed to the more popular 13 line versions that are so common nowadays.

Is there anyone in Pakistan, or does anyone have connections to Pakistan, that could help me get a copy?

I am in the United States, and most, if not all, masjids here are filled with Egyptian or Arabian publications which contain 15 or 18 lines per page.

I know that this is very nitpicky, but this is for a gift for a friend of mine that I did hifz with 20 years ago.  I would give him mine, but the pages are not in gift-worthy condition. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lot of them have trouble traveling due to visa issues or whatever.  So, could it be possible to have a fighter that simply does not fight in the US?  With as many international shows as the company puts on, many countries have much more relaxed visa programs than the United States, so it would allow a fighter to build up a resume against top quality opponents on international cards.

Why couldn't Glover fight in London, Abu Dhabi, Australia, Canada, or Japan (and of course, Brazil) in the last two years under a UFC contract while his U.S. status was being sorted out? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't been contacted by mods or anything like that.  Just some political correct and oversensitive "just a few bad apples" religion defending types.

I do this to highlight the backwards culture that I was raised in.  As an exmuslim who's lived in Muslim countries, I have more experience with Islamic brutality and injustice towards women than most.

If political correctness demands that we never say anything negative about Islam, then I will stop posting here.

<DATE> 2012-07-11 20:11:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Iran is a shia country which claims to follow Shariah law.  But whenever they enact a new law, or carry out a severe punishment of an existing law under the guise of Sharia, most muslims will say "They are shia, so it doesn't count, etc..."

My question is this:  Is Shia sharia so severely differnt than sunni shariah?  Most of the differences in the two sects are historical and are based on theories of succession after the death of the prophet.  So how does this make their laws any different?

When they execute adulterers/whatever, is it not the same sharia law followed and understood by sunnis?

I understand that there are some serious differences in beliefs.  But the laws carried out by Iranian authorities rarely reflect those differences; rather they are laws which are held by both sunnis and shias.

If I am wrong, please correct me </TEXT>

Why these guys above other scholars?  Is it because they are young, and have a better time communicating with the youth?  Because, honestly, their message doesn't seem too different from what the older scholars say.

TLDR:  Just wanted to know why you guys are fans of these guys.

<TEXT> A lot of people here don't subscribe to /r/atheism because it is a cespool of memes and facebook screenshots.  But there is also a lot of substance there.  Most of the good discussions involve Christianity because that is what most western atheists are familiar with.

There are a lot of good links to videos and articles in this subreddit that don't get the attention they deserve because there are just too few of us.  We want /r/atheism to join our cause, but we don't want to get meme'd to death.  

So why not cross post all the good articles and videos from here to that sub?  Are there rules against this?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's called Les Mills Pump.  I know this is the P90X sub, but I see Insanity discussed here a lot, and didn't know who else would be knowledgeable enough to give insights.

My question is, for weight loss, is this as good as p90x?  The reason I ask is because I am very intimidated by p90x, and I believe that I must do another, less intense bootcamp before attempting p90x.  Especially because of the cardio and pull ups.

This Les Mills Pump workout seems to be all weigh lifting, all the time.  I know the guys at r/fitness would probably like it because they pretty much rail against cardio whenever they can, so I came to ask you guys. </TEXT>
