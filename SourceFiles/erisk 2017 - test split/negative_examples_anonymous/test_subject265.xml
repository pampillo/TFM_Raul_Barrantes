<TEXT> I thought that it was confirmed that Otis Toole killed him

The official conclusion is that Toole killed him. 

Plus Dahmer made a full confession, why else would he admit to the 1978 murder of Steven Hicks when he could have gotten away with, why admit that but leave Adam Walsh out? 

Also, Dahmer was obsessed with heads and skulls, discarding the head is not like him. Neither is preying on children. I've read about this theory more than a dozen times. I don't think it's likely.

<TEXT> What's your point? And you didn't answer: which of those labels are you for not even offering anyone anything for their labor? Other employers might not be making them offers that you like, but you're not offering them anything at all. Should you really be on your high horse?

I don't assume to have the right to steal other people's time and labor, two things that have a definite value and cannot be replaced. 


What are the basic necessities of life, and why do they cost 150 times what they did 200 years ago?

Basic food, shelter, communication, and transportation. Why the fuck would we be assessing our current cost of living based upon standards that are two hundred years old? 

By what metric? Obviously not by what it takes to survive.

Survival? Can a family survive without working in this country? Please include sources and/or examples. 

I doubt that's a choice many would make. There are far better alternatives, even to people who are vastly poorer than the poorest people in our society.

Again your argument is "it could be worse. You could have been born 5,000 years ago." That makes no sense at all. It's now that I refer you to the history of the US from the late 19th century up until the end of WWII. Please explain to me why workers aren't entitled to a reasonable share of the fruits of their labor. 

Anyone who advocates a minimum wage.

Banning people from working or prohibiting employers from exploiting people? See, I believe that there is at least a baseline value to human time and effort. You feel that human beings are worthless and should be exploited at every opportunity. 

I said nothing of the sort. If you want to help them avoid living in squalor, help them become productive enough that they can convince an employer to pay them enough that they can afford better.


This is a good point. We should all have the right to convince employers that our time and effort is* worth more. I prefer the collective approach of negotiating. That's how employers negotiate wages; collectively. They collude with their competition and set wages at a baseline. What's wrong with employees doing the same thing? Why shouldn't there be a baseline to the value of human time and effort? What price do you put on your time with your children? What would you do to spend more time with them? 

Which?

You'd have to be blind to have missed it. It's the edit at the bottom of the comment.

<TEXT> Assuming you're not an employer, which of those are you for not even offering them *anything* in compensation for their labor?

Every company I've worked for have been wage thieves. I've worked for people who have bounced my paychecks. Now years later they still have not faced the consequences of their actions. If I bounce one check I will either pay for it or I'll go to jail. In many cases I'll go to jail whether I pay it or not. 


You can miss the point if you'd like, but it's quite obvious I'm not suggesting that. I'm asking why a 'living wage' has gone up 150 times. I can certainly understand it costs more money to live the sort of lifestyle people are accustomed to today.

A person earning minimum wage cannot afford the basic necessities of life in today's society. 

So you're willing to admit that a 'living wage' is no such thing?

Fuck no! I feel that $15 is just about right with an increase to $17 by 2020.


Maybe we should let the poor decide what type of roof they'd like to have over their heads, rather than forcing them to pay for the same quality of roof as rich people like to pay for. Or if you think they deserve better, help them pay for it. Don't ban them from working because they can't convince an employer to pay them enough to buy such a roof.

And by letting poor people decide, you mean "allow them to choose to live outdoors". Who's talking about banning anyone from working? 

There are plenty of people who survive, by choice, without electricity. Their interaction with the rest of society is limited, but they do fine. If you'd like to help people participate more thoroughly with society, or feel it's their right to do so, then help them to gain the skills they need to convince an employer to pay them enough to participate effectively in society. How does banning them from working help with that? Either way, you're no longer talking about a 'living wage'.

And there you have it. You think that people should be living in squalor and should only be able to cover their life expenses if they meet your arbitrary criteria. Again, who said anything about banning them from working? 

Why didn't you answer my questions at the end of my comment?

You got it. 

Abortion was and still is the primary issue the religious right used to take over the Republican Party, using lies and deceit. The issue has always been other people's morality, and control. 

I'll delete this shortly, TMI, but there is a young woman who exists today from an unwanted and unplanned pregnancy, whom I love very much. Her parents made what IMO was the right decision. Difficult, but manageable. The extended family had the resources to make it work. 

Others don't. Poor women die from coat hanger or chemical abortions. Or they continue the cycle of poverty. No help for them from the religious right. 




Nope, there's never any actual concern. This is about personal judgement. Thanks for sharing. I'd prefer that every child conceived had the opportunity to be born into a loving and welcoming environment. In "my perfect world", no one would ever get pregnant unless they wanted to or were at least ready to handle being a parent. Every child would be born into a loving home, and not one child would go without a single basic necessity. But we all know that's not the current situation. Rather than continuing on this hateful course, we should try working together to actually address these problems. These problems are solvable, no matter what the far-right has to say.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If no one will offer you a job that pays for food and shelter, what you need is charity or lower prices, not to be banned from working by a minimum wage law.


Working people do not need charity. They need compensation. This is simple. Those who do, need not ask for help. They earn their keep. It's not their fault that the bosses are lazy, greedy, and treacherous. 


[It has been estimated that throughout prehistory, the world average GDP per capita was about $158 per annum (adjusted to 2013 dollars), and did not rise much until the Industrial Revolution.[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_the_world) That makes a 'living wage' today roughly 150 *times* the 'living wage' of 99% of all humans that have ever lived. Why the increase?


"You're absolutely correct. Americans should be living the lifestyle of the 19th century. The bosses shouldn't have to share the fruits of their workers' labor. Thats crazy talk. We should all live in huts, eat beans and rice for every meal, and be thankful for the opportunity. After all, we can't all be born into wealth. Just do what the master says, children." 


What about the federal minimum wage in 5000 BC, or 1900 AD? People were still living then, last I checked.

Bwahaha! You're right. We should all be living in mud huts. Because fuck people, amirite? 

If it costs 150 times more just to live, I would guess that expenses have increased.

Right, only the wealthiest people should have a solid roof over their heads. Who cares if it's impossible to function in today's society without electricity? Who cares if 90% of job opportunities are only available online. The internet should only be available to the most privileged. Who cares if a person needs to have clean cloths to remain employed? Laundry machines are a privilege for the wealthy. 

What about the wealthy? What are the historical numbers on them? What are the historical numbers on wealth distribution?

How does it smell with your nose wedged so far up there? 

Edit: Let me ask you something. What determines the cost of coal? Is it what the market will bear? Or is it the cost of extracting, handling, and shipping coal and then maintaining all of that overhead?

<TEXT> Thank you for your simple honesty. Seriously. I myself could never go through with an abortion unless my wife's life was in danger. I'm a father and I could never live with myself. But, I don't pretend to have the right to tell others what they can and cannot do with their own bodies. That attitude is just wrong. 

But you're absolutely correct. Banning abortion doesn't stop abortion. It just drives it into back alleys and into the hands of criminals. 

But the "prolife" people were never concerned with reducing abortions. Their goal is control over the personal choices of others. It's an obvious fact fhat the best way to reduce the number of abortions performed is to reduce the rate of unwanted pregnancy. The most effective method of doing that is through sex education and easy access to contraception, which those that you mentioned oppose. This was never about abortion. This "issue"  has always been about controlling the behavior and choices of women.  </TEXT>

Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not entirely convinced that the bombings or their strategic placement were entirely necessary.

<TEXT> So simple food, shelter, transportation, and communication are too much to ask for when you work for a living? Why are expenses so much higher? What are you talking about? You understand that the federal minimum wage is well below what it was in the 1960's right? Did expenses increase or did wages stagnate and even decrease for most folks?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A Chicago investigator who determined that several civilian shootings by police officers were unjustified was fired after resisting orders to reverse those findings... 

See, this is the problem. A real investigator does not receive or heed orders from the subject of his investigation. This is doubly true for an "independent investigator". 

Daviss termination came less than two weeks after top IPRA officials, evaluating Daviss job performance, accused him of a clear bias against the police and called him the only supervisor at IPRA who resists making requested changes as directed by management in order to reflect the correct finding with respect to OIS, as officer-involved shootings are known in the agency.

IPRA? That's the **Independent** Police Review Authority. That's right, supervising investigator Lorenzo Davis, 65, a former Chicago police commander who served the CPD for twenty-three years was terminated because he refused to change his report so that it would be in agreement with the findings of his superiors. 

The performance evaluation covered 19 months and concluded that Davis displays a complete lack of objectivity combined with a clear bias against the police in spite of his own lengthy police career.

"How dare he question the actions of the police? And him a former officer himself, no less. Well I never!" w

Apparently city management isn't even willing to listen to objective criticisms of its police departments even when it's coming from a former officer. 

If there are a few bad police officers who have committed some shootings that are unnecessary or bad then it erodes the publics confidence in all the other police officers out there, Davis said.

Can you believe this guy? Who does he think he is attacking the police like that, an official supervising investigator charged with investigating police misconduct? How can the police do their jobs in such a hostile environment?

<TEXT> Slave level wages is an oxymoron.  

Is it? If a person works forty hours a week and their wages don't even cover their living expenses, what do you call that? When workers have to go into debt in order to keep working, what do you call that? 

The cost of living isn't tied to the minimum wage. It's likely that raising the minimum wage may cause a slight increase in inflation, but not enough to prohibit the move. Right now the economy that you're talking about is propped up by government programs and taxpayers' funds. A business that can't operate while treating it's employees with simple human dignity and adequately compensating them for their time in a way that is sustainable doesn't need to exist. This isn't the 19th century.

<TEXT> I'm pointing out the blatant fact that War is not something to admire. And that those who lost their lives are not heroes. They are victims of state propaganda. Just like you and every other muppet who blindly buys the bollocks you're espousing.   

Try telling that to the people of Europe and Asia after WWII. Explain to them why it was a mistake for the allies to confront the Nazis, Japanese and other axis members because doing so would just be statism. I guess to you it woukd have been preferable to die or be enslaved rather than fight. Makes total sense from where you're sitting right now doesn't it? Here you are enjoying the stability and peace that was hard won by your predecessors. Of course it's very easy for you to denounce them and their sacrifices. This is the definition of self entitlement. You aren't faced with such a decision so of course it's easy for you to shit on those who were. 

What do the Iraq or Afghanistan war have to do with anything I've said other than the fact that it's a shitty attitude one must possess in order to crap on those who serve. I don't agree with either of those conflicts, but I'm sure as shit not going to blame the soldiers, airmen, sailors, or Marines that are fighting them. They don't get to choose what wars their countries engage in. You're like that guy who went to Chick-Fil-A and yelled at the cashier about the corporation's donations to anti-LGBT organizations. 

Edit:

I'm not mocking anyone you obedient donkey.

Right.

And even if you're from a country that does have a national service requirement (like Finland or Israel) then you can still passively resist. 

You really should do have a basic knowledge of the topic you're discussing or at least do a little research before you begin bloviating about a topic. American troops were drafted to fight in war until after the Vietnam War. Most of the soldiers who fought in WWII were draftees. Passive resistance resulted in serious prison time.

Response: what a conspiracy theorist writes on his facebook is not politics. Unless I was missing something he isn't a political figure. 

Counter: He's the leader of a political movement. He's mobilized more than a hundred like minded conspiracy theorists in an effort to shadow our armed forces during a routine military exercise. The people of texas and right-wingers across the country are taking him very seriously. If you're going to disregard him, then you should also disregard posts about Donald Trump, Rand Paul, and Scott Walker.

On the witness stand,Jean-Marc Connerotte(fr), the original judge of the case, broke down in tears when he described "the bullet-proof vehicles and armed guards needed to protect him against the shadowy figures determined to stop the full truth coming out.Never before in Belgium has an investigating judge at the service of the king been subjected to such pressure. We were told by police that [murder] contracts had been taken out against the magistrates." Connerotte testified that the investigation was seriously hampered by protection of suspects by people in the government. "Rarely has so much energy been spent opposing an inquiry," he said. He believed that theMafiahad taken control of the case.

<TEXT> You seriously think that 50% of us would go under if we didn't get constant support from the government. 

Yes. 25% are disabled and retired. The other quarter aren't making enough to survive. The ruling class or your "job creators" don't give a flying fuck about the retired and disabled and they'd pay the working poor even less than they do now if they were given the opportunity. You may remember the period in American history when the ruling class of the South paid their workers nothing. 

How messed up is that assumption? Fully half of our country is dependent on the other half to make sure their fridge works...

I'd argue that everyone is dependent on others for survival in some way. No one produces everything they consume from day to day and no one is capable of it. The people in the top 5% of wealth and income are much more parasitic than the retired and poor. They don't work in any traditional sense. They're kids don't have to work. They live off the fruits of other's labor. They use their money and power to buy politicians and influence our political system. They've even got people like you to defend them while they do all of this. 

That's not even close to being true and it's nowhere near the ideals that put this country in the leadership position it has now. If half the citizenry is taking rather than producing then in 20 years how many producers will there be? You have bought into this false idea that you need the government to succeed. 

Either you have a very selective memory or you're very ignorant about US history. The economic "leadship position" we've enjoyed in the last 70 years or so is the result of being the only super power that wasn't ravished by war after WWII and the fact that our leaders enacted quite a bit of policy that supported and protected the workers of this country. Because of voters like you the workers in this country have lost the support and stability they enjoyed for some forty odd years after the war. Now you've been convinced that this is the result of lazy people rather than a ruling capital class that has only one objective which is to invest as little as possible, pay no taxes, and keep all of the profits from fruits of our labor. Man, they saw you coming from miles and miles away.

<TEXT> Senator John McCain's war record is astonishing. His aircraft was the one that inadvertently ignited the fire that burnt the USS Forrestal to the waterline. While it was in dry dock, he volunteered to serve on a squadron fighting in Vietnam. He was on his 23rd mission of that tour when he was informed that his unit was being tracked by enemy radar. He remained with his formation and dove to deliver his payload. It was during this time that he was shot down. He fractured both arms and a leg ejecting from his aircraft. He spent the next six years imprisoned as a POW. Two of which were spent in solitary confinement. He was offered release because of his father's high rank, but refused to leave without the rest of the POWs.

<TEXT> Mathematically, as income goes down a fixed tax like a sales tax will increase as a percentage of ones income. Your ideas suck because 1) sales tax is a discretionary tax. Since rent, car payments, food and I some cases clothing are not subject to sales tax, what IS subject is the discretionary items. If we give low income earners a break on the sales tax on the big flat screen, maybe we are just paying for them to go from the 40 to the 50 incher. That should not be my responsibility.  If you want to have an honest discussion about who should pay for our governments services, I'm certain that it's not the governments role to supersize tvs.

Again, my state charges sales tax on food. People who buy cars pay sales taxes on them. Not everything in a person's home is discretionary. People need refrigerators, laundry machines, ovens, and other appliances to live and those things are taxed. You repeatedly bringing up televisions amounts to basic hateful demagoguery. You might as well be Reagan with his racist caricature of the Cadillac driving "Welfare Queen". You continue to ignore the taxes that the poor pay on food, clothing, appliances, services, utilities, and everything else that costs money. 

The idea also that the all of the non taxpayers are retirees and handicapped people is farcical since it's fully 50% of working age people. The demographics aren't even close to being in your favor. Last your ideas suck because every outside source you cited supported my viewpoint - the nominal tax rates, the bogus nytimes stat and the last citing that confirmed half pay nothing.

Those 50% that you're talking about don't even earn enough to feed themselves and their families. I've repeated this in every reply since you first mentioned them. This thread is a discussion about allowing them to earn an income that sustains life, and here you are complaining and alluding to them being lazy moochers. What good would it be to tax people who aren't able to cover their basic food and shelter requirements? Are they going to be more productive workers and* students when they're homeless and starving? How would that serve society?

<TEXT> I'm not defending the police, i'm being realistic and explaining reasoning behind their actions. Just because they are wrong doesn't mean there is no reason behind their fear.

No, there's not. If they obeyed the law (the constitution), they would have little to fear as they would not often find themselves in terrible situations where they are and must be the oppressors. 

 Canada also has guns, but only 1/3 ownership, and comparably lower shootings by police and otherwise. Things aren't perfect in Canada either though.

And just what do you think the rate of gun ownership is in the US? Because the [data shows] (http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/15/the-demographics-and-politics-of-gun-owning-households/) that it's roughly ~~the same as that of Canada~~ a third. 

If only police would police eachother more often.

This isn't just an issue of the police policing each other. This is about the criminal justice system ignoring the very clear text of the constitution and the simple and basic rights that it provides for the American people.

What? The median American household income is $50,000. Their effective tax rate is between 10% and 15%, not zero. The people you're talking about* paying nothing are retirees, the disabled, and severely impoverished families earning less than basic sustenance levels. If you take issue with not taxing them then that's for a different discussion and it would be about basic decency and morality, not the tax code.

They were forced to defend their homeland, he was trying to do it in the most harmless way possible to prevent his own execution of treason. That's what you don't get. You have one mindset that he has absolutely no compassion for the camp's victims and actions. He's a frail old man going to prison. Learn to forgive and forget. Vengeance is a dirty move.

<TEXT> It's not about forgetting anything.  It's taking into account that he ISN'T responsible, and that he allegedly had no knowledge of what was happening behind the scenes just as many in the Wehrmacht didn't.  

Read his wiki article. He knew damn well what was happening and has admitted it. He personally observed the operations of the gas chambers and the burn pits. 

The Wermacht were not just innocent soldiers. They were complicit in countless atrocities including rounding up "undesirables" for the camps, razing villages and raping and murdering civilians, and destroying German infrastructure in order to prevent the* allies from being able to utilize it. All of which have been well documented. Your's is a revisionist, apologist's history. 

He's a frail old man going to prison.  Learn to forgive and forget.  Vengeance is a dirty move. 

I stand by my previous statements addressing this misrepresentation of the facts.

<TEXT> So let's just forget about all of the people his unit killed, right? He's just an old man now and he's been really good since the war so let's just forgot about all of those grandmothers, grandfathers, mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, aunts, and uncles that they brutally tortured and killed? He was a member of the SS his job was to steal the personal possessions of the condemned innocent and catalog them to be included in the Reich's spoils of war. He's personally responsible for these atrocities whether you want to admit it or not. 

Since when did we drop the punishment/retribution aspect of prison sentences? Even the most progressive states view prison sentences as punishment. Sure rehabilitation is important, but that doesn't mean that people who commit atrocities should be able to avoid the consequences of their actions if they can demonstrate that they've been rehabilitated. He may die in prison. He may not. It's only a four year sentence. Will he even serve the whole thing? Who knows? But if he does die in prison it will be in better conditions and under better treatment than his organization ever afforded anyone. I've no sympathy for him now or ever. He's lived a long full life which is something that millions of people were never able to do because of him and people like him. Good riddance.  </TEXT>

And just how much money should that cost? How much of parents' time should have to go into earning this income? 

You're putting words into more mouth by trying to tell me what I support. I support families and their right to be together. I'm for supporting families and the children they have rather than drawing imaginary lines and standing on a stump telling everyone else how their families should live. I support finding solutions to our problems as a society, apparently you support hate and prejudice.

<TEXT> Okay, thanks for the source. It doesn't prove your point, but thanks anyway. 

In 1970 the top marginal tax rate was 70% not the 90% of the fifties. Your link says that the effective tax rate was 33% on couples earning $12,000 or more. Where do you think that puts the super wealthy? 

Furthermore the top average effective tax rate today is not 33% like the article suggests. [It's more like 21%] (http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/01/18/us/effective-income-tax-rates.html?_r=0) and when you consider sales taxes our current system is regressive with median income families paying at least the paying at least that much or more. 

Yes loop holes allowed and still allow the wealthy to weasel out of their tax obligation, but undoubtedly they paid more before Reagan began thisrace to the bottom with our marginal tax system.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Are you sure about that?] (http://taxfoundation.org/article/us-federal-individual-income-tax-rates-history-1913-2013-nominal-and-inflation-adjusted-brackets) It's worth noting that the effective tax rate would be the same during those years with a high top marginal rate because employers would not pay much into the top margin as it was a waste of money. Why pay someone more when it's just going to go to the government?

<TEXT> I'm for more and more radical reforms, but I don't see that happening any time in the near future. 

What information are you talking about? Insurers already rely solely on the information they* receive from PDs to make decisions about drivers. Police are notoriously bad about properly filing accident reports and whatnot. This would put the police and IA in a position of criminal liability if they fail to properly report incidences, and the insurance companies in a position to press criminal charges against dishonest and unprofessional officers. These days you're not a person unless you're a corporation. Let them answer to their insurers. The communities certainly aren't getting an adequate response to their concerns. 

Insurers would have an obvious interest in protecting their investments from unprofessional and reckless officers. Once an insurance company has assessed the risk involved with insuring each individual officer, I don't see why premiums would have to be any higher than they are for nurses or truck drivers. Officers with bad records would have high premiums or would simply be denied coverage. Problem solved. In assessing the risks of insuring officers in the field the companies would inadvertently be assessing their risks to our communities and weeding out those who were unacceptable.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> An Atlanta Journal-Constitution/Channel 2 Action News investigation of the case found that:

- Glynn County police officers interfered with the GBIs investigation from the start, seeking to protect the officers.

- The department tampered with the crime scene and created misleading evidence that was shown to the grand jury.

-  The local district attorney shared the states evidence with the officers nearly two months before the grand jury convened and cut an unusual deal with them just before it met.

<TEXT> It assumes no such thing. But it does put the burden of defense and the liability on an insurance company rather than the tax payers and justice system. Let an insurance company investigate and explain the actions of their premium holders. If they can't, let them assume liability and terminate the policy. The officer will then be uninsurable, out of a job, and no longer a threat to the public. It also separates the criminal and civil liabilities of the job. Tax payers need not pay for crimes committed against them.  </TEXT>

In 1977 he talked his way onto the board of directors of a localcharitable organizationand forged a series of letters from its executive director to the mayor of Kansas City, and from the mayor to other civic leaders, commending his generous volunteer efforts and generally singing his praises. Eventually he had himself named the organization's Man of the Year, and threw a festive awards luncheon in his own honor.

I didn't say that they should be disbarred. I suggested that there were possibly ethics violations that should be investigated. But, on reddit you're not allowed to be wrong without hordes upon hordes descending upon you to call you names and tell you that you're wrong.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So you don't have a source. 

Because what I'm saying is that Jim Crow laws were unconstitutional and once challenged they were thrown out by the applicable courts including SCOTUS. An attorney should not be telling anyone to break the law, but they can render an opinion on whether a statute is lawful and constitutional. In this case the SCOTUS has already determined the constitutionality of same sex marriage. Senator Cruz knows the law. He's not rendering an opinion, he's advising public employees to disobey the law which is very clear.  </TEXT>

But, I suppose if he possessed a license to practice law and violated the bar's ethics guidelines it would need to be investigated and he would possibly face sanctions.

<TEXT> I understand that the author of the article said disbarred, but I said investigated. 

Where those Jim Crowe laws upheld by the SCOTUS? Do you have a source that suggests they were? 

Because, from what I understand your hypothetical is the exact opposite of history. Politicians and lawyers were mostly supportive of the oppressive policies, or in other words, the exact same position as Cruz and friends. It took the Supreme Court to overturn those unconstitutional laws and the established powers were resistant to those changes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe you're right. It's still generally accepted that government Facebook pages are public forums and the removal of dissenting comments constitutes a violation of free speech. Those pages do not belong to private individuals, and while they may ultimately belong to Facebook, that company is not conducting the censorship. Public employees are selectively deleting opinions with which they disagree.  </TEXT>

No I quoted two* different parts. The big Mathew part was comprised of consecutive passages, granted the formatting sucked, but it was one part of the scripture. I don't think it's morally sound to turn your back on family because they don't believe the same things you do.

<TEXT> 22 Indeed I will cast her (Jezebel) into a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of their deeds.
23 I will kill her children with death, and all the churches shall know that I am He who searches the minds and hearts. And I will give to each one of you according to your works.

Matthew 10:32-39New International Version (NIV)

32Whoever acknowledges me before others,I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven.33But whoever disowns me before others, I will disown before my Father in heaven.

34Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.35For I have come to turn

a man against his father,
a daughter against her mother,
a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law
36a mans enemies will be the members of his own household.[a]

37Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.38Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.39Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it.


Let's not forget that all things are forgiven in Christ. So by your beliefs, Jeffrey Dahmer is in the kingdom of God looking down on us right now. As well as any child molester, genocidal maniac, murderer, cannibal, war lord, or any other monster who repents before death. But a Hindu boy who died of cancer at the age of eight is burning in the eternal fire.

<TEXT> You're right we did have a war over the institution of slavery 150 years ago. Those on both sides cited the bible as their justification. And in those actions they were both absolutely correct. The bible justifies and supports slavery. There are also parts of the bible that instruct followers to treat each other and even nonbelievers with fairness and decency. 

In the time since, the god of Abraham has proceeded to kill off as many as 50% of human pregnancies in their first trimesters. Literally tens of billions of spontaneous abortions. It shouldn't be surprising though, as the bible came with its own set of instructions on how to perform a holy abortion. So gather the kids and open your bible to the book of Numbers chapter 5. It's holy scripture and the word of God, so it has to be good.  </TEXT>

Maybe you weren't saying that it has to be that way, but you did seem to say that this was an unimportant part of the program. There are some moral guidelines that are universal to our society.

People see that video and they can't believe it, because it's so terrible. If we're going to have any faith in the system at all, then the men who committed those crimes need to be held accountable. This wasn't simply a case of a lack of training or a field mistake. This was actual malice.  </TEXT>

He wasn't being unruly. He was sitting down holding a camera with both hands. They definitely could have done more to communicate and reason with the guy. You can say it was justified all you want, but if that old man (as cantankerous and obnoxious as he is) were to have been shot and killed, or anyone else in that room had been shot and killed, all of this would have been a moot issue. Those guards are there to protect everyone in that room and they undoubtedly failed.  </TEXT>

You didn't specify the person was mentally ill. You're moving the goalposts here dude. 

This is how that situation works. You either give him the benefit of the doubt and treat him like a human being, or you find out about his mental health issues when he's already on ice. I understand that officer safety is important, but the people you encounter each day are just that, people. I've argued with officers on here that felt that the shooting of James Boyd was completely justified. It's easy for me to get worked up when I think I'm talking to someone with no respect for human life.

<TEXT> Source? Everything I've read said he wasn't arrested or charged. 

Regardless, that security guard fucked everything up here. He didn't announce himself or his intentions. He went right for the camera that was strapped to the man's neck. Obviously anything related to the neck is going to trigger a fight or flight response as well as involuntary reactions. There's not a single excuse for the guard's lack of communication. He went directly to physical violence. He had no justification to put his hands on that man or his property. That guy is an unprofessional hack. Police officers (and apparently ex police officers) are violent thugs. When you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail.  </TEXT>

If someone was an actual threat and unwilling to listen to reason, and I had backup, a taser, and pepper spray. I would start with the taser. Two adult men in reasonable shape with multiple "less lethal" options should be able to disable and restrain a suspect. If not, then keep him at bay until more help can arrive. There's also [this] (http://www.slashgear.com/police-test-less-lethal-bullet-alternative-17369435/) and other stuff like it.

You have the gun pointed at someone who is unarmed and that you'd prefer not kill, and he/she doesn't comply. What do you do then? It's too late for your taser, your pepper spray, or even fisticuffs.

<TEXT> Oh, C'mon man. Of course an officer has the same right as anyone else to defend himself. If someone actually attacks an officer or tries to tear something out of their hands that obviously warrants the use of force. Use of force  equal to beating the shit out of someone 

That rarely happens. Usually the officer is the aggressor. There are countless videos on here of cops trying to steal people's cameras and assaulting them. Cops purposefully engage a person in a way that elicits an involuntary response. Like putting their hands on and pushing people in the chest or neck. Grabbing a person's extremities and bending them in a way that forces your body to react. 

Don't give me this bullshit that people aren't being fair to cops. The asshole in the video blatantly walked over to the elderly gentleman and grabbed his camera which was around his neck. What did he expect to happen when he broke the law, violated this man's person, and tried to steal his property?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Computers aren't responsible for wage stagnation. 

Fly away executive pay and income inequality are the result of the regression of our tax system. We removed the disincentives for insane levels of executive pay when we pulled back the top marginal tax rates. Our tax system is effectively regressive at this point. Executives can command unlimited levels of pay and neither they nor their employers face any tax penalties. So naturally that's where all of the new revenue is going to go. This has also resulted in wage stagnation so it's no coincidence that wage stagnation began in the late seventies/early eighties when the top marginal tax rates were effectively neutered.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you looked at my initial comment you would see that I said percentage. Keep in mind when all is said and done the Romneys are left with more than $11 million to live on whereas the median income family is out more than a fifth of their living expenses (that's right, not just their incomes). They've contributed a fifth of their living expenses (that's food taken out of mouths, medicine and doctors visits that have to be skipped, necessities like a new roof or a new transmission that they'll somehow make do without) and you and Romney call them lazy and moochers. 

You are a simple child. You have no business discussing these things. Go to bed kiddo. 

Edit: your numbers are wrong. The total tax on the median family $10k. Which means that the Romneys pay 213 times that of the median family, which would make sense considering that they take home 282 times the income.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> You obviously don't understand how sales taxes work.

Lets take the Romneys. I just read that he paid 14.1% on his income of $13.7 million. That's $1,931,700 in taxes leaving them with $11,768,300. Now how much do you think the Romneys need to live? Let's be generous and say they **spend** $2,000,000. Sales taxes are usually between 8% and 12% so let's just go with an even ten percent. That would be around $200,000 putting their total tax at $2,131,700. Or 15.5% their annual income. 

Let's do this with a median income family. The link I sent you puts their effective tax rate at 12.7% of $50,000 or $6,350 leaving them with $43,650. Now, a family of three or four will most likely spend every cent on living expenses just to survive. So assuming they spend all $43,650, $4,365 is going to go to sales taxes. Leaving them with $39,285 making their total tax rate around 21.5%. 

See how it works when you present an actual argument instead of dismissing and insulting people with no supporting evidence?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **The tactics of racial profiling,**

Not at all nice, but not equivalent to genocide. 

We're not talking about genocide. That was clarified more than once. Try to focus, will ya. 


**warrantless searches,**


Cops generally aren't allowed to do this. 

It's called stop and frisk, and it happens in most major cities. 


**civil forfeiture,**


What's wrong with civil courts?

You should read about the practice of [civil forfeiture. ] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_forfeiture_in_the_United_States) It has little to do with civil courts or justice. It's state sponsored theft. 


**military tactics**


What are "military tactics?" That term means nothing unless you define it. 

Using military uniforms, weapons, and equipment on civilian populations. Storming private residences before dawn. Etc


**secret police**


I wouldn't call US police "secret" given their habit of dressing in clearly noticeable vehicles and running around in marked cars. 

US drug task forces are most definitely secret police. They dress as civilians and drive unmarked vehicles. They're allowed to break all sorts of laws in their pursuit of suspects and convictions. For someone who really wats to argue about this topic you sure are ignorant. 


**criminal informants,**


Who's going to know what criminals are up to? Think very carefully. I know it's hard, but I think you can answer this question.

Criminal informants are [people and often children] (http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/09/03/the-throwaways) with substance abuse or other problems who are extorted into doing police work at their own peril and expense. 


**black site interrogations**


American police don't do this. 

[This is getting really old, man] (http://www.rawstory.com/2015/03/chicago-police-commander-who-ran-homan-square-black-site-quits-amid-new-lawsuit-threat/) You're aware that you can do your own research, right? Your ignorance is your own responsibility. 


**warrantless surveillance**


So what? 

Really? You're perfectly fine with this? Do you not understand how historically, this sort of thing does not end well. 


**no-knock raids**


So what? 

[This is on example of what these lead to.] (http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/07/us/georgia-toddler-stun-grenade-no-indictment/) If the evidence being sought can be destroyed in a matter of five minutes then theres no excuse for using a swat team and violating the rights of a suspect. If they're looking for a person they can get a warrant and surveil the premises until they locate them, or you know, "do their fucking jobs". 


**summary executions**


US police don't do this. 

US police kill at least one person every eight hours. Plenty of them have been summary executions. [James Boyd] (https://youtu.be/JwytoxMuk4U), [Tamir Rice] (https://youtu.be/mSCftESyKyU) are a couple of examples. 


**character assassination, and propaganda campaigns waged against their own citizens,**


Or either of these things for that matter. 

During the Baltimore protests the police fabricated and disseminated falsehoods about Freddie Gray and other Baltimorians. Every time there is a police shooting the first thing the police do is release the victims criminal history regardless of how irrelevant or unsubstantiated it may be. In absence of any character damning information, they go after the victims friends, family, and associates. 


**It's about understanding the underlying causes and conditions that explain why things happened and how they happened.**


A lot of people in Germany didn't like Jews. 

Oh that's true. But there's much more to it and there's is a lot to compare to the US. In case you haven't noticed, we have a few problems with racial tensions and race relations in this country. Most of the people who are targeted as an excuse for the increasing militarization of the police are racial and ethnic minorities. We also have a lot of economic problems that can be used to antagonize racial issues. If you can't see some similarities here, then you should find a different past time because you don't get history at all. 


**Those tactics were instrumental in the creation of the environment in which the totalitarian regime was able to commit some of the most heinous war crimes in modern history.**


Except they weren't. You don't need a complex bureaucracy like the Nazis had to commit genocide. As the Rwandans were nice enough to show us, all you really need are tools and men. Every nation on earth has that. 

Rwandans aren't Germans. Germany needed the complex bureaucracy, hence it's construction and maintenance. You're working from the assumption that the nazis were able to seize power solely on a general hatred for Jewish people. That's simply not true. Of course it was a factor, but Germany had gone through decades of economic turmoil and were fertile ground for fascism to take hold. Hitler promised economic recovery which he delivered via unsustainable militarization. The German people were spiteful from losing WWI and felt that they were being treated unfairly by the rest of Europe. They used this as justification for their invasion of Poland. The Jewish people weren't their only scapegoats. The Reich demonized and euthanized the disabled, Roma people, communists, and literally anyone else they deemed undesirable. Yes the Jewish Holocaust was the very pinnacle of their evil, but it's shortsighted to ignore all of their other crimes.

<TEXT> Way to be objective pal. Go ahead and look up [effective tax rates.] (http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/01/18/us/effective-income-tax-rates.html) You'll see that there isn't a big difference from the bottom rung and the top rung. Then you have to consider sales taxes. When a family only has an income of $50k (median American income), everything they earn is spent. When you account for sales taxes on lower income families you might as well just add that sales tax straight to their effective tax rate. When you do that you'll see that the poor often pay more than the rich.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You and I obviously aren't having the same conversation. Propaganda is only one of the number police tactics and  crimes that I mentioned. 

The tactics of racial profiling, warrantless searches, civil forfeiture, military tactics, secret police, criminal informants, black site interrogations, warrantless surveillance, no-knock raids, summary executions, character assassination, and propaganda campaigns waged against their own citizens, are applicable to both groups.

History isn't just about memorizing facts and figures. It's about understanding the underlying causes and conditions that explain why things happened and how they happened. Those tactics were instrumental in the creation of the environment in which the totalitarian regime was able to commit some of the most heinous war crimes in modern history. Ignoring those factors is to ignore the fundamental basis of their crimes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't been downvoting you, but I may now. 

"You people"? That's always a big hit. 

I'm not sure how an atheist can be "righteous".  Or that righteousness is even relevant. 

We could look at being fiscally conservative and how the death penalty and its required appeal system is simply inefficient and expensive costing tens of millions of dollars per death row inmate. 

We can look being effective and compare the murder rates of states that have capital punishment vs states that do not and conclude* that the threat of the death penalty is not an effective deterrent for capital crime. We can also acknowledge that life without parole is far worse than a death sentence as it offers no quick and easy conclusion for the condemned. 

We can look at being just and acknowledge that as many as 4% of the inmates sitting on death row were wrongly convicted. What percentage or number of innocents killed in the name of political and judicial expediency would be acceptable to you? And if those people were your loved ones or even you yourself? 

The only "rational" argument for the death penalty would be revenge, retribution, vengeance, wrath, whatever you wanna call it. But I wouldn't call it rational. It's emotional and zealous. It's about instant and total gratification not thoughtful deliberation. Not what we want or need out of criminal justice system.  </TEXT>

Knock on the door and see what you get. There's no need to violate anyone's constitutional rights or endanger anyone's life. 

By the way, a drug dealing operation is by definition "a business".

What makes you so sure that all employers would be so willing to show up to court like you say? What makes you so certain that they too wouldn't be eager to destroy incriminating evidence? 

Why aren't the police even sending out letters to these employers? Obviously when someone works hard for hourly wages and tips and the theft of these funds constitutes a crime with an obvious victim. Why aren't the authorities zealously prosecuting these crimes?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Again, the numbers are so disproportionate that a division by 5 isn't going to do much. Like the article stated, US police have killed as many people in the last 24 days as the British have in the last 24 years. 

If you took the number that the British have killed in the last 24 years and multiplied it by five, it would be 275 over 24 years. What does that change? American police have killed more than 600 this year alone. The total number dead in the 24 years in question would be closer to 20,000 as a conservative estimate. So then you're looking at 275 (corrected for population) vs 20,000. See what I'm saying. Population correction doesn't make things look much better. Or you can go the other route and divide the US down to 4,000 (conservative estimate /5 over 24 years) for 55 vs 4,000. Still looks really really bad. 

Edit: US police kill people at a rate 72 times that of British police (corrected for population size) or 363 times without correction.  </TEXT>

Judge Ronald Adrine found probable cause for the charges of murder, involuntary manslaughter, reckless homicide, negligent homicide and dereliction of duty against Cleveland Officer Timothy Loehmann, one of the two officers involved in the case.

Additionally, the judge found probable cause for the charges of negligent homicide and dereliction of duty against Frank Garmback, the other officer.

<TEXT> People are charged and convicted for everything and anything, left and right. We currently have more people incarcerated in the US than any other country in human history. 

You're obviously biased. This type of reluctance to prosecute is universal in cases involving the police. In states that require a grand jury indictment, the prosecutor purposefully includes evidence that casts doubt on the guilt of the offending police. A prosecutor would never, ever, in a million years, do this in a grand jury hearing involving a nonLEO. Prosecutors rely heavily on police departments to bring charges against offenders. They're part of the same team. They're not going to hold the police accountable anymore than they'd hold themselves accountable. They already have judges, prosecutors, grand juries, and the entire system on their side with everything they do, no matter how depraved. They don't need you on this sub sucking them off.

I'm not trying to be "edgy". I'm genuinely and rightfully angry. These men recklessly killed an innocent child. If we're to have any faith in our criminal justice system or the rule of law in this county, it's imperative that they are tried and convicted.  </TEXT>

You're not wrong, but that's still not evidence of his existence, which is what I was talking about. Personally I don't care if he existed or not being that I'm not a believer. I just don't cotton to "historical facts" which have no objective evidence supporting them. 

Pretty sure that same logic would need to be applied to genghis khan if we're being consistent.

Is this true? Did no one write about Genghis Khan while he was alive? I'm going to look that up. But undeniably there are countless cases of evidence of his existence including the DNA of his descendants. 

Edit: On second thought your claim about Genghis Khan is obviously bullshit. The man who began a campaign to conquer the world was written about extensively by enemies and allies.

<TEXT> Oh, okay so now you're suggesting that protocol when dealing with a **potential** gunman is to speed as close as possible and shoot without even really looking at the suspect first. I wasn't aware that the police were being trained to operate as death squads. 

I will not "chill it". I'm not fourteen, I'm thirty-four. This is a clear case of two officers, on video recklessly shooting a child, and letting him die in the grass and snow. If you want to defend these monsters go to PnS. You'll be greeted with open arms by the other murderers and robbers. I'm sure they'll even let you buy them a beer or wash their cruisers.  </TEXT>

It seems to me that 85% to 95% of the time, the prosecutor gets the charges and the convictions they want. When the police kill a child in cold blood; "It's too difficult." </TEXT>

<TEXT> No first I said "fuck you" and described you as a "bootlicker" and as scum, then you called me an asshole to which I responded in kind. 

There's nothing intelligent about your arguments here. This case has been discussed countless times on this sub and elsewhere. You're not adding anything by wedging your nose directly between the buttocks of the nearest police office. I don't care what you think of me or my opinion. I thought I'd already made that clear. You're defending two kid killers. You have nothing useful to say. 

How dare you insinuate that I support violence against the police or anyone else. I simply pointed out that these officers need to be appropriately punished for their crimes and as a deterrent for all other officers lest they too began to treat human life with reckless indifference. Public canings are a valid type of punishment, used in countries like Singapore and such. Doing this on a live feed who simply get the message out to everyone that killing kids is not tolerated and especially by those who hide behind the authority of a badge.

<TEXT> You're a complete dipshit. The fact that you're even mentioning risk assessment here illustrates how biased you are. The police did not assess the risk involved in this situation. Risk assessment doesn't include positioning oneself as close as possible without first assessing the risk. 

You need to understand things dont work like they do in movies. 

Right. Tell that to these two gung-ho Dirty Harry wannabes. Don't tell me that. I'm the one arguing that police should follow protocol and consider the safety of everyone involved. 

You're a police apologist and you're here defending the indefensible. Will you be singing the same song when the police kill someone you love? You make me sick.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the evidence speaks for itself. The police abandoned protocol, recklessly sped as close to the suspect as physically possible, and proceeded to shot him multiple times. They then failed to render aid and treated his child sister like a violent criminal. There are plenty of charges that would be appropriate as well as the charge of murder. They're scum for what they did. You're* scum for defending them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ohio is an open carry state. So it wouldn't necessarily have been illegal even if the gun was real. The police could have pulled up to the curb and used their PA to order the boy to drop the weapon and get on the gound. Instead they flew in as close as possible to surprise him and began shooting him before the car even came to a complete stop. They then refused to render aid to him as he lay gasping on the ground. They manhandled and handcuffed his younger sister and threw her in a police cruiser. 

Everything about this case is fucked. Both of the officers involved should be stripped naked and publicly flogged before being thrown in prison for the rest of their lives. They're scum for their murderous insolence. You're scum for defending them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You charge them both for not following procedure, ignoring the law and the safety of the community, and murdering a twelve year old boy. 

Edit: I'd like to point out that 

Judge Ronald Adrine found probable cause for the charges of murder, involuntary manslaughter, reckless homicide, negligent homicide and dereliction of duty against Cleveland Officer Timothy Loehmann, one of the two officers involved in the case.

Additionally, the judge found probable cause for the charges of negligent homicide and dereliction of duty against Frank Garmback, the other officer.

So OP is at the very least, being disingenuous about there not being a legal basis for criminal charges in this case. This is one of the reasons why it favors the police to drag these things out as long as possible. People forget the facts and the narrative can be skewed in the court of public opinion.

<TEXT> Violence always begets violence. 

I would argue that fascist policies and horrific circumstances have put religious fundamentalists, who are sometimes also rapists, in power in Afghanistan . I don't know enough about Afghanistan to form the most well rounded argument. If I had to chance a guess about the current political, social, or economic situation there, I would start with the total war that has occurred there in the last forty years or so. Then i would move on to the intermittent and half-assed efforts (if even that) at rebuilding and supporting those people you hate. This dipshittery comes from mostly people you think are superior, they were the major parties from the beginning to our current untenable situation. 

[Afghanistan] (http://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Afghanistan) has a long and beautiful history that is both multicultural and worth learning about. What has happened there is truly horrific. But, it's easy to knock a place and a people because of its current situation. 

I mean the best time to assess the United States and it's cultural developments would have been in the last third of the Civil War, right?

Edit: Since you so cowardly deleted the comment I'll ask your question again and answer it. 

OP: "I don't disagree" is vague, do you think that this ruling might have been correct? 

I do. 

I'm not a Swede. I'm not one of the Swedish caseworkers, judges, lawyers, or jurors involved in this case. I dont know this young man who was a minor child when he committed this heinous crime. I don't know his background, his medical history, or what types of horrors or abuses he was exposed to in Somalia. I don't think that you fit any of these qualifications either. But, now that you're asking me questions again, I'll repeat myself:

Why do you feel like you have the qualifications to argue about this one way or another? 

Why do you feel that this sub is the place to do it, especially when rule 2 prohibits this kind of agenda?

I have a couple of questions for you? Why do you feel like you have the qualifications to argue about this one way or another? Why do you feel that this sub is the place to do it, especially when rule 2 prohibits this kind of agenda? You know you can go to /r/lolmorbidreality, right? I'm pretty sure that their rules would allow you to hate on anyone you like.  </TEXT>

What happened to that girl is terrible and the offender needs to be dealt with. I'm assuming you're an American by your vengeful attitude and you posting this shitty article that mentions Anders Breivik as if he was somehow relevant to this case. Perhaps you can put your thirst for blood aside and consider the long term consequences of incarceration and what goals are ultimately meant to be achieved.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fine points. I agree that education needs to be the foundation if we're going to effect any real change in the US. More needs to be done to eliminate the root causes of poverty itself, which are manifold. I know a lot of conservatives like to cite welfare programs as creating a culture of dependency, but I think that's disingenuous. 

We have for several decades, fostered a very lucrative black market for several plants and compounds that we know will always command a certain level of demand. Instead of allowing criminal individuals and organizations to profit from these markets we should decriminalize, legalize, and heavily regulate even the most illicit substances. (It's ironic that the federal government still views cannabis as one of the most dangerous compounds known to mankind) A good example of the effects of sufficient regulation and taxation would be the [trend of teen smoking] (http://www.hhs.gov/ash/oah/adolescent-health-topics/substance-abuse/tobacco/trends.html) over the last forty years or so. 

I know this may sound simplistic initially, but it can be done. And yes, I'm talking about the legalization and heavy regulation of stuff like heroin and meth. You may or may not know that in much of the country we already give addicts methadone and other analogues to heroin in very strict and supervised environments. Methadone is not demonstrably safer or less addictive than pharmaceutical heroin. Hell, methamphetamine is a prescribable medication under US law, and we prescribe Adderall and other amphetamines to children (which I do not advocate. I'm just pointing out the hypocrisy and ineffectiveness of our draconian drug laws) 

If all of these things were reasonably and inexpensively obtainable under rationally controlled and supervised conditions, it would render black markets unprofitable. In the meanwhile, we can actually address the problems by requiring counseling and offering treatment to addicts. Dismantling the drug cartels and offering a safe and controlled environment for addicts takes them out of their comfort zones. I can't imagine many people saying to themselves "I've never had it so, I'd like to go down to the clinic and try some heroin or crack". But, I'd prefer that if they felt that strongly about it, they had access to a clinic with mandatory counseling and safe conditions rather than being fodder for pimps and other types of undesirables in flop houses and whatnot. Prohibiting drugs puts drugs in the hands of criminals. I hear this argument in regards to gun legislation all of the time but rarely do I hear a rational proposition for dealing with our country's drug problems.

<TEXT> Looking back at your comments, I'm curious as to why you chose to focus on that study while ignoring the definition of recidivism provided at the top of the page in question. 

Recidivism is one of the most fundamental concepts in criminal justice. It refers to a person's relapse into criminal behavior, often after the person receives sanctions or undergoes intervention for a previous crime. Recidivism is measured by criminal acts that resulted in rearrest, reconviction or return to prison with or without a new sentence during a three-year period following the prisoner's release.

Is it because this very relevant definition hurts your argument, and the study works as a fantastic distraction from that fact?  </TEXT>

It's not like one can strip a person of their cultural background nor should they. There are absolutely aspects of some cultures that are harmful to women and other minorities. It's a difficult problem to address. I guess the idea is that once a person or group is appropriately educated and raised from poverty, these other issues should take care of themselves.

<TEXT> You make some fine points all of which I'm sure are being debated by the relevant authorities in Sweden and elsewhere. 

I'm not sure about prison being an effective deterrent to violent crime. At first glance, it seems obvious that it would be, but when you look at the socioeconomic and psychological causes of a lot of violent behavior, it becomes much more complicated. It's also worth mentioning that prisons in the US are known for victimizing inmates and conditioning them to be irrational and violent when they are eventually released. 

I'm getting a lot of downvotes here, and I guess I understand. If someone had done something like this to my child, prison for the offender wouldn't be the issue. But my argument is basically that we in US have been locking up anyone and everyone for several decades now. While overall crime has decreased, it's not necessarily a result of our increasingly militarized police or our eagerness to imprison even nonviolent offenders, and violent crime hasn't disappeared. 

There are people all over the world who would argue that what we're doing here is wrong, but we're not going to listen to them. It's up to us to come to our own conclusions. We are one of the least likely to allow any other body in the world to violate our sovereignty, yet we do it to others quite often. If a country like Sweden wants to operate a criminal justice system that focuses on aiding victims, rehabilitation, and preventing recidivism, they have every right to do so and we should let them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No you're making shit up. Yes there were some black soldiers and even a few (as in three or four) black officers, but they weren't volunteers and they weren't treated like typical soldiers. You're just repeating lies from the Confederate apologists that have come before you. Your ideas come from the "lost cause" period of revisionism. Go ahead and try tofind one legitimate source for your claims here. The fact that you would bring up blafk slave owners is indication enough of your general ignorance on this topic and your adherence to post war Confederate propaganda.  </TEXT>

It's always good to help, but sometimes these projects end up backfiring in unforeseen ways.

"More than a dozen" And those were just the times their overpriced PI was around to catch him. 

I'm not going to say that this wasn't a waste of money, but I'll argue that it wasn't a complete waste. Obviously some well placed, relatively inexpensive cameras could have  been as effective as this guy. But someone stealing that amount of public water is unacceptable. Fuck them for the way they did it though. They should have spent $5,000 to receive $15,000 or $20,000 in fines and penalties and then been able to use the surveillance equipment to catch other offenders.

<TEXT> Poor women do not have access to any healthcare under medicaid. At least not until they get pregnant in my state. 

My insurance covers my routine checkups. It also covers me if something terrible happens that puts me in the hospital and unable to pay. 

Contraception is a preventative treatment. What about this aren't you understanding? Why should married people be required to wear condoms? 


"Wah! I don't want to contribute to something I'll ostensibly never benefit from even if I have benefited from it in the past, and my children will most likely benefit from it in the future. Screw everyone, I got mine!"

Literally millions of people are unable to afford preventative care and end up much sicker than they would have been otherwise. The costs are in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Tens of thousands will die in the states that refused to expand Medicaid solely to defy the president. 

Anyone who thinks that health insurance is complete rip off has never been sick and therefore working on the faulty logic of "it hasn't happened yet, and therefore won't ever happen", or is probably wealthy enough to not be worried about in the first place.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They lost the election by a split vote. Purely northern states wanted to impose their will on southern states.

Yeah nothing says tyranny like representative democracy. 


They fired first because they were idiots. 

Belligerent idiots. But yeah, no argument here. 


The seceded because they objected to having no say and no rights in their own territory.

This is where OP dives off the deep end. The Confederate states tried multiple times to force their will on the federal government as well as northern states themselves with the fugitive slave acts. Then they tried to force their will upon the people of Kansas when they contested its formation as a free state. 


By expand you mean establish more states with westward expansion? The North imposed their will on the south which completely violated the basic compact of the union in the first place. 

And how was that? By allowing Kansas to decide for themselves whether they wanted to allow slavery or not? Or by voting in the elections? 


And of course they would want them returned, they were property to them. This would be like crossing a state line and getting your car impounded then sold off because someone else didn't like that you owned it and you got nothing for it. 

Yeah it would be exactly like that if your car was a person you had enslaved and brought into a free territory. 



Slavery is still wrong, and it was a major issue, but it's not the whole sum of all issues. Both sides were dicks to each other. 


The protection of the institution of slavery was the sole reason for the South's secession. I'd have to say that the south were the bigger dicks being that they committed treason, attacked the US, considered owning people as property as the greatest material interest of mankind, and literally everything that the surviving confederates did in the decades after the war. 

Edit: I'm sorry, I thought this sub was about pointing out the factual errors of confederate and southern apologists. If I was mistaken, I'll gladly move on. .  </TEXT>

The reason people purchase insurance is to be prepared for the unknown. As far as healthcare goes, it's not a matter of if we'll get sick, but when. We've been denying people preventative care and forcing them into emergency departments long enough to know that experiment has been a failure. This is why we pay more than any other industrialized nation but aren't anywhere near the top in terms of care.

Condoms are a form of contraception. The birth control pill can be used at the same time as condoms. 

Your family is sacrificing because you have to provide them health insurance? Well fuck that. I mean, I'm sure there aren't any females in your family right? And even if there were, they shouldn't have access to medical treatments for their lady parts right? That's just not Christian. /s

Your ideas are bad and you should feel bad. Private insurance requires members to pay premiums and deductibles out of their own pockets.

<TEXT> my apologies for not holding the reddit message board in such high regard to be concerned with proper use of grammar. 

Now redditors may be known to make common grammatical or spelling mistakes, but the vast majority of users obviously make at least some effort in presenting their arguments and ideas in clear and correct form. What you've posted in this thread reads like the rambling drivel of an eight year old. Why even bother to post here if you're not even going to try? Why would you expect anyone to take your ideas seriously when you're not even willing to take a few extra seconds in order to present them properly?

If you've spent any amount of time on this sub you would know that we there are countless cases where the police made a judgement call that led to the death of another person, the circumstances were suspicious, and most often the police aren't even investigated.

<TEXT> Rich white women do get free contraception.

How do "rich white women" get free contraception, *and can you please explain this without using racism? 


Having bareback sex vs wearing a condom is a lifestyle choice.

What does this have to do with birth control? Who* the hell do you think you are that you can tell others what to do in the privacy of their own bedrooms and in the confidentiality of their doctors' offices? 


My family shouldn't have to sacrifice for either case.

Wtf does this even mean? Your family isn't sacrificing a damn thing. As it was already pointed out by another user, contraception is preventative treatment and is ultimately cost neutral or even represents a net savings. You're just whining because you don't feel like you're adequately getting to decide what others can and cannot do. 

Edit: was breaking a rule.

The South seceded and attacked the US to protect the institution of slavery and therefore the way of life for the Southern ruling elite. Ultimately the south was most upset over the creation of a new free state, Kansas. That and the election of Lincoln who opposed the expansion of slavery into new territories and states meant that the slave owning states had lost most of their political traction and their economic interests would be ignored. The Confederates weren't worried about states' rights when they opposed the formation of the new free state on the basis that slavery was an inalienable personal right that states couldn't take away. They weren't worried about states rights when they introduced and passed the fugitive slave acts and tried to force their will upon northern free states and the federal government who had no interest in capturing escaped slaves.  </TEXT>

That's just ridiculous. The US had suffered no damage or attacks on homeland soil aside from Pearl Harbor. We were entirely intact and just getting started with our military industrial complex. Japan was suffering from repeated effective bombing campaigns and over a decade of economic sanctions and trade embargos. How do you come to the conclusion that "we very well could have failed"?

<TEXT> While Germany was giving the soviets a run for their money.

Really? Or did they merely succeed in causing the deaths of millions of people before having their asses handed to them, their country burned to the ground, and half of it ultimately seized by force. Let's not forget that Germany's imperialism made much of Eastern Europe vulnerable to Soviet invasion and occupation. 

 If japan had won the battle of Midway and turned around the pacific, ( which they nearly did ) the axis had strong chances of winning WW2. 

But they didn't win, and there's nothing that suggests that the US would somehow have folded if we had lost midway. Let's not forget that the US was brought into the war by the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Do you think we would have just given up and surrendered to the Japanese? Outside of Pearl Harbor, we suffered virtually none of the mass destruction that parts of Asia and Europe suffered. We were entirely intact. Yes the Japanese fought hard but there was never a chance that they were going to defeat the US. By the time we dropped the a-bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan was largely burned to the ground.

<TEXT> Did I say they weren't a threat? No, I didn't.

I was simply pointing out the ridiculousness of your assertion that they "almost won". 

Please tell us more about how they were winning before the allies decimated their entire empire. Tell us about how these competent leaders dragged their country and citizens into an unwinnable unsustainable military campaign that ultimately resulted in the fracturing of their country and the nearly total destruction of its infrastructure. 

Tell us how it was an entirely competent decision to wage an invasion against the Soviets. Explain how in their great wisdom and cunning strategic logic they came to form an alliance with a belligerent and ideologically diseased state like prewar Japan, and how that state waged an antagonistic bombing campaign against the United States effectively bringing them into the war. Tell us about these "great leaders".  </TEXT>

Incompetent leaders wouldn't have almost won against all the superpowers of the world. The Nazis were fucking evil, and I am glad they lost. They were competent as hell though.

That's hilarious.

During the final days the Reich and the Wermacht destroyed as much infrastructure as they could in order to prevent the allies from using it.

<TEXT> I disagree. You cited one example of a Jamaican citizen and two other black gentlemen who were commissioned officers (a lieutenant is not a senior officer) but were then dismissed to join the Union Army early in the war. The 1,500 or 2,000 black soldiers and three black officers would have been prohibited from serving in the confederacy in 1862 and your source says that 10% of them went and joined the Union Army. 

You don't have an argument. You either don't understand military rank structure or you're willing to ignore glaring contradictions in your narrative in order to maintain it. Three low ranking officers who served very shortly before being disbanded would not have qualified in any manner as "senior military officers". By the end of the war these men would have been American war heroes, not defeated Confederates. But I encourage you to continue your efforts. Maybe while reading about these men and others like them you'll learn a thing or two about how evil the Confederate leadership really was.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When the Louisiana State Legislature banned people of color from serving in the Confederate Army in February 1862, the regiment was disbanded. Morris and about 10% of the other former 1st Louisiana Native Guard joined the Union Army in September 1862 and were organized into a new unit that was assigned the same name. There Morris became the first black Jewish officer in the Union Army. 

Hmm. Got any other great examples?  </TEXT>

Beyond being predatory the twelve step system is also not an [effective drug or alcohol treatment program, ] (http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-alcoholics-anonymous-work/)  it is a fundamental violation of our first amendment rights as many people are pushed into twelve step whether they're religious or not. Jesus is the most common* topic of discussion for many twelve step groups. This is an everyday violation of our constitutionally protected religious rights, but you don't hear anyone stopping or backing up governmental process over it.

Businesses close all of the time. Most close because of causes that are completely out of the control of the organization's leaders. If a bakery refused to follow sanitation codes the health department would shut them down and it would be their fault. It wouldn't matter if they had a religious belief that washing their hands is wrong. If a business is operating on such unsustainable policies as refusing to provide the products and services that they deal in, why should it be a surprise when they have to shut their doors?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A business closing down is hardly the same as a person dying. Businesses close and are restructured all of the time. Most don't close as a result of a policy so stupid as refusing to provide the good or service they deal in. The individual(s)  with the* capital can choose to take* their money and knowledge and engage in other business efforts. A dead person can do none of* these things. The argument that businesses are people is as ridiculous as one can be. Businesses are comprised of people and those individuals already have the protections and rights of a human being.

<TEXT> Two New Yorkers are driving across the country. When they cross the Texas border the passenger looks at the driver and explains "Texas cops are supposed to be the worst and they really don't like New Yorkers. Let's try to obey all of the traffic laws so we can get through this state without any problems."

They hadn't made it very far when the driver notices a state trooper's cruiser appear behind them with lights ablazed. He quickly puts on his signal and pulls over. The trooper approaches the driver side window and the driver quickly lowers his window, only to find the officers baton smashing into his face. 

"What the fuck was that for!?" the driver exclaims. 

"I don't know how you city slickers do things in New York, but in my state you'll have your license and registration waiting for me when I approach your vehicle." the trooper barks at the driver. Frantically the driver retrieves the paperwork and hands it to the cop, who proceeds to write him a ticket. "Wait right there. " he spits while handing the ticket over to the driver.  He walks around the car and taps on the passenger side window with his baton. Nervously the man lowers his window. The officer quickly strikes him in the face.


"What the hell did I do!? He shouts as blood runs down his chin. 


"Son, that's so when you get a few miles down the road, you won't be saying to your buddy [I wish that sonofabitch would've tried that shit on me.]." </TEXT>

<TITLE> Who killed Angela Mischelle Lawless? A local unsolved case from 1992. Innocent man was imprisoned for sixteen years. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-31 01:49:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Reserve deputy Rick Walter was catching up on paperwork one night in the fall of 1992 when he was told to check out an abandoned car near Interstate 55.

He found a 1986 Buick Somerset at the top of an exit ramp about 1:30 a.m., just outside of this southeastern Missouri town that rises above the Mississippi River floodplain. Inside was the body of Angela Mischelle Lawless, a 19-year-old nursing student.

Lawless had been shot three times, once in the back of the head. But when Walter looked inside the car, he couldn't determine exactly how she had died.

"It was dark, and I didn't know if it was somebody just passed out," Walter said. "We opened the door and saw all the blood."

Fifteen years later, Walter, now the Scott County sheriff, sits in his windowless office and lets the Lawless case play out in his mind. There should be little reason to think about it now. Joshua Charles Kezer was convicted for the killing and sentenced to 60 years in prison. The case is closed.

But things just don't add up, Walter said.

Lawless clearly fought for her life against at least two attackers, Walter said, and yet, investigators identified and pursued only one suspect.

There were no witnesses to the killing. No physical evidence - DNA, fingerprints or murder weapon - linked Kezer to the scene. In fact, Kezer's friends and family say he wasn't even in the state the night Lawless was killed.

"People in the law enforcement community and regular people here have told me that they got the wrong guy in jail," Walter said.

So in early 2006, Walter did something almost unheard of in law enforcement: He reopened a murder case that was not only closed, but had already produced a conviction.

The sheriff and one of his detectives began reviewing hundreds of pages of investigative reports and witness statements. It would be a daunting task.

Witnesses were scattered. Fingerprints and blood can be reviewed and retested, but it was unclear what could be gleaned more than a decade later.

None of that mattered to the sheriff, a former construction worker who regularly wears a quarter-size pin that reads "My Son is a Marine." He already knew that if he ever got the chance, he would reopen the case.

"I wake up most mornings and wonder, 'Why am I sheriff?'" said Walter, who was elected in 2004. "I think this is why - to find the truth on this case."

FIRST TO THE SCENE

Everyone called her Mischelle. She was a cheerleader for the Kelly High School Hawks basketball team in Benton, and a farm girl at heart, having been active in the local FFA Organization.

In her younger years, she was a Girl Scout who volunteered as a candy-striper at area hospitals, so it was only natural that Lawless would pursue a nursing degree at Southeast Missouri State University.

"That's what she always wanted to do," her brother Jason said.

In many ways, Lawless was a bundle of contradictions. By her sophomore year in college, she was juggling boyfriends and partying a lot, friends said, yet she remained a regular at the Baptist Student Union.

Though she weighed just 95 pounds, Lawless wasn't afraid to stand up for herself. 



I know this may be pretty well known, but it happened very nearby and has been complicated and painful for this area.

<TEXT> Ed and Bob had just landed the biggest sale in their firm's history. Ed knew he had to hurry home to his pushy wife Mary, but Bob persuaded him to have a drink or two at a nearby tavern. Being a lightweight, Ed vomited all over his shirt and tie after only a few. 

"Aww man, Mary is going to kill me Bob. You know she doesn't want me drinking or hanging out in bars." 

Bob, feeling overly confident about their recent victory was sure he had the solution. "Don't you worry about her.  Just put this crisp twenty in your shirt pocket. When she sees the vomit tell her that someone else puked on you, and gave you the twenty to pay for the cleaning." They continued to drink until the Tavern closed and each took their own cab home. 

When Ed arrived, Mary was waiting, furious at the hour, and his obvious state of drunkenness. 

"Where have you been!" Ed was already unbuttoning his shirt. "You're drunk... and covered in vomit! What is wrong with you? I should have listened to my mother you worthless sack of... "

"Now hold on one minute, woman!" Ed drunkenly interrupted while Mary tore through and examined his things. "I can explain that vomit! It wasn't me! A guy down at the Tavern threw up all over my shirt. Look in my shirt pocket, there's a  twenty dollar bill. He was honorable enough to pay for the cleaning." He was already crawling into bed, and pulling the covers over himself. "You see, I'm not always the bad guy." 

Mary held up two twenty dollar bills. " Ed, there was $40 in your pocket." 

Ed lifted up from his pillow, squinted one eye, and tried to focus on her. "Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you. He shit my pants too."

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I understand this wasn't a very popular virtual/sampler synthesizer. I can understand some of the gripes I've come across on forums. Support being discontinued being the biggest. But, I am impressed by some of the sounds this thing can produce. I like that it can be programmed and then disconnected from the computer. I was wondering if anyone had any advice with programming the thing. I've spent a few hours with it, and I'm amazed by the number of parameters and controls the thing has. The multi function seems really powerful. Does anyone have any experience with uploading patterns? I've noodled around with many of the presets, but still haven't found a clear path toward making my own patches from scratch. Is that possible? Any other general advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Questions about syncing a Microbrute with an M-Audio Venom. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-16 19:29:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I would like the sequencer on the Microbrute to sync up with the Venom. I have both MIDI cables amd USB. I would prefer to be able to sync them without using a DAW as I would like to jam free of the computer. I understand how to use MIDI to control one device with another, but I'm not getting anywhere with sending a clock signal between two. Can anyone help me with this? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a Arturia Laboratory, a Microbrute, and a Boss Dr-550mkII. Two interfaces , Berhinger Q502USB and a an old Tascam US-122L. Tascam has an in/out so I've been playing with it. I have plenty of cables. I am trying to sync these devices without using the USB connection on the Microbrute. If I use more than one USB connection for audio, the noise becomes unbearable. I want to use these devices separately without one ever controlling the other. Just sync. The Laboratory has a Midi in/out. The Microbrute and Boss have an input only. Is there any way that I can make this happen? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am going to keep this as short as possible. Whenever I have my computer plugged into my mixer via USB, I get a loud, high pitched buzz.  It went away the other night, and came back tonight.  I tried isolating every appliance and florescent bulb in the house with no effect. I'm wondering if a failing HDD could cause this? Maybe the power supply fan? I really enjoyed combining my analog gear with my soft synth. Now the frequencies of both are affected. This noise is driving me nuts!

edit: first I tried lifting the ground on the PC, but that only helped when I used my best cable. (I have several music USB cables) I realize that the cables were in the inductive field of my stereo.  Moved the stereo box and everything went away. Sweet silence. I then reapplied the ground to protect my machines and house. Sorry if I wasted anyone's time. I feel like this has been a useful thread. I learned more than a couple of things. Thanks to everyone who commented. Y'all helped me get into critical thinking mode. I don't get enough of it. Thanks again.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> What guitar or bass pedals are appropriate for an analog synth? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-03-08 11:33:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Let me first say I'm open to any input as long as it is budget oriented.

I recently acquired an Arturia MicroBrute, and I naturally would like to expand the capabilities of the instrument with some simple effects (and later some complicated stereo effects). I was looking at Zoom effects first because of the value of their entry level line (and the seemingly ancient Reznor endorsement). 

My question mostly involves the frequency processing of bass and guitar effects. I know there is a distinct difference between these instruments. How confined are these pedals to these frequency profiles? I am a bassist by nature (bass guitarist), but I intend on using the full range of the MicroBrute through looping and sampling. I just don't have much money.

I can shoot some sexy pics of the MicroBrute and my Laboratory 49 if necessary. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2012-09-12 20:07:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I see plenty of cases where a user has reposted a link in a different subreddit, and gets plenty of upvotes from it. Is that OK? I was chewed out for posting an article when another article has been posted on the **same story** in either the same or a different sub. Is that OK? I've seen some redditors who post their links in several subs at the same time. Is that OK? There is a bot that reposts everything from /r/news, /r/worldnews, /r/politics, into a separate subreddit, /r/POLITIC . That user will get infinite karma from that bot. Is that OK? I've read the FAQ and I still don't have a clear Idea of what is acceptable and what isn't. Is there a general consensus on this topic? Because there seems to be a lot of experts out there.  
Edit: spelling and formatting </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why do institutions and businesses who offer "Veteran's Discounts or deals" require an active military ID?  </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-09-12 19:04:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Is it not common knowledge that more than 90% of the veteran's walking around are not active duty or retired and therefore do not currently hold a military ID of any kind? I'm posting this because my university sent out an email inviting everyone to a special football game. The email explained that veteran's and active military get in free with an active ID. Only people who are active, retired, or disabled get an ID. In fact not all disabled have an ID. All of these offers just end up being a slap in the face. Have you ever tried to convince someone at a business or institution that you're really a vet? It's disgraceful!  </TEXT>
