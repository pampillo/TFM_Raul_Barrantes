<TEXT> This was all shot with the camera on auto, it's tough to work out exposure etc using a small phone display outdoors.

Immediate things I noticed: DJI Pilot automatically saves the video to your phone/tablet, which absolutely destroys the battery. My Note 4 died before I got the third battery into the Phantom. The ultrasonic sensor/visual positioning thing screws with your shots if you're trying to fly smoothly, best to turn it off or fly in attitude if you're looking for stable footage.

A fair bit of chromatic aberration in the final image, and it really doesn't like being pointed into the sun. I was happy to discover after my phone ran out that it'll fly without the phone connected, and because there's a record button on the controller, you can still film even if you can't see - the last 5 or 6 clips were done blind.

Oh, and it hates taking off on a slanted surface. Out in the bush I couldn't find a totally flat spot for liftoff, and the little "whoosh whoosh" warmup routine it does when you start the props ended up tipping it over. Grrrrr. Anyway hope that's helpful to somebody! </TEXT>

<TEXT> 10C is a great product - but it's not as good a headset as the 20S, and it's not as good a camera as a GoPro. The headset is similar in quality and usability to the SMH-10, so it's no bad thing, it just doesn't have the huge 2km range and voice controls of the 20S.

If you don't need pro quality vision I think it's an awesome and very convenient piece of kit. Very easy to use. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He's a wonderful combination of arrogant, I'm-the-best-fear-my-wrath bluster, mixed with a comically mercenary habit of ditching his team to play with other huge talents or recruiting like mad to stack his own team. There's nothing organic or real about the teams he won titles with, and this year he "came home" by gutting the shit out of Cleveland's roster and stacking that to the rafters as well. 

I respect his court vision, his outrageous physical gifts and his ability to make big plays at important times, but I hate his bullying style of driving to the rim and just bashing his way in. There's nothing pretty about the way he finishes to me. 

I love nothing more than watching him get shat on, looking forward to seeing it again, hopefully in an earlier round of the playoffs. Also looking forward to watching Cleveland struggle with massive salary issues in the wake of GM James wanting more talent and more money at the same time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I spent last week doing my RPA license course... I don't think unlicensed operators are gonna realise just how much controlled airspace there is. Here's a quick look at Melbourne, for example, the first legal bits of sky are out as far as Brighton or Williamstown. Forget about going North, there's a wide controlled zone around Melbourne airport. http://i.imgur.com/jIbQAUG.jpg

People are just going to break the laws that are left, and not get caught. CASA seems insanely understaffed as it is (it's taking them 6 months to put a stamp on an Operator Certificate at the moment) - there's no way they'll be chasing every guy with 2 drone shots in his video that look like they were taken near a building, or within 3 nautical miles from a helipad.

Meanwhile, those of us that slogged through the process will still be obliged to plan, risk assess and log every flight and the charge levels of our batteries, wait our 30 days for area approvals and whatnot. I dunno how rational it's all looking to be honest. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Need any further motivation to get behind the Warriors? If they beat the Lebrons, /u/DORK-NOWITZKI will construct his own home-made cock'n'balls hat and film himself wearing it around his local shopping mall. Do it for the cockenballs, Dubs. </TITLE>

Damnit, I should have hedged with a bet on the cavs too, so that my burning hate and fury if they win would at least be slightly quenched by some guy running around in a cockenballs hat. </TEXT>

Lebron beasted, Thompson made me feel like golden state was lucky to get a defensive board, Smith regressed to the mean and the whole Cavs team dropped their bundle when Kyrie went down.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The one dunk I ever got in a game. It was a D-grade women's game and I was reffing. All alone on a fast break, this lady puts up a layup, and I can see the instant it leaves her hand exactly what's about to happen. It's going to sit pretty right in front of the rim.

I was obsessed with dunking. At 5"11 and white, this was not a healthy obsession. I used to jump off things to make it happen. I could jump straight up and hang on the rim with both hands, but was an inch or two short of being able to throw it down. It just burned me inside, I used to dream about dunking at night.

So when I saw that ball, something snapped inside me. I was already at full sprint, but I changed course to head for the basket instead of the baseline... One, two, launch... I caught the ball with one hand and jammed the fuck out of it, and roared like a mountain lion.

Then I had to blow the whistle and give somebody a sideball as they all looked at me in total shock. And to make things worse, one of their kids on the sideline started crying and saying "NO JORDANS, NO JORDANS."

Doesn't matter; got dunk. I never got another dunk in a game but I can now die happy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I suspect it'll be terrible. I know a company that's working on it - soundracer.com - and those guys have a fun thing that plugs into your car cigarette lighter. It reads the revs on your engine and then transmits the sound of a huge V8 to your car stereo so it feels like you're driving a monster truck. 

But it relies on revs - to do this for an electric vehicle, you'd need to simulate the presence of gear changes. It would ruin the effect. </TEXT>

But every battery company on the planet reckons they've got something with twice the energy density on the bench due to better structures or chemistry. Obama threw 6 billion dollars at the industry a few years back and there's just a constant stream of new ideas coming through. I have a lot of faith that major breakthroughs will change the game in the next 5-10 years.

<TEXT> Aprilia runs hot as a motherfucker. You'll need tin foil underpants if you "cruise" on it so you can get a nice crispy skin on your baked spuds. Good bike for going flat out on, but grumpy around town. My pick is the S1000RR, the 2015 model optioned up with the active suspension and cruise control. That's one hell of a bike. Super easy to putt about on, plus goes like stink on a full throttle, and having ridden a good few superbikes I'd say it's also been the comfiest for me. </TEXT>

Range, battery density, fast charging standards and battery price are - and those will come down fast as the Gigafactory and other mass battery manufacturing operations kick into gear.

<TEXT> He's right - full throttle at a standstill doesn't take off like a rocket. It's an immensely powerful and torquey motor locked in a very high gear. I suspect most gas superbikes would beat it to 40mph. But hit the gas at 60mph, like I was on the Skyline road, and there's *nothing* I've ridden that comes close. It's absolutely insane. And if I owned one I'd downgear it as far as is practical, because I ain't gonna be doing 218mph any time soon and I'd want that monster performance as accessible as possible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's how basic traction control works when it has different levels you can select. Slide control is a bit more complex as I understand it. 

The latest and greatest bikes are starting to run inertial control units that can get very accurate readings of things like your lean angle, the pitch of the bike, g-loads and yaw. I believe slide control uses the lean angle and yaw readings to allow the bike to get a certain amount of sideways happening before it gently intervenes. 

I've only had one quick track session on it, and I was focusing on the active suspension out there, so I didn't play with that setting. But the electronics are just getting more and more amazing.  </TEXT>

I look at that guy and experience about double the 'holy shit' factor I get from Arnie - it's an awe inspiring display of insanely hard work and discipline combined with jackpot genetics and the best nad shrinking drugs money can buy. Arnie's physique is stunning but believable. This guy is so far beyond that, it looks almost like another species.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My dad had a car accident at 16 in which he was thrown through the windscreen into a pool of burning petrol. He had no eyelids for a few months and his face ended up looking quite a lot like this guy's, minus the nose thing. 

He was in hospital for 18 months, and had time to come to terms with the fact that nobody was ever going to give him anything based on his looks. 

It turned out to be the making of him in a funny sort of way, he worked his arse off, married a fine gal and became a very successful guy. I've got a ton of respect for the way he carries himself and after the initial 'whoa' most people just forget it's there. He's never even bothered going back to get more plastic surgery to make it look nicer. 

Tough stage of life for it to happen but life goes on.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cheers for the kind words. This is no intermediate level bike, it's a monster. I'm gonna try to get hold of some of those 800cc Triumph triples, maybe a BMW F800 GS or a crossrunner. Til I've tried a few I can't really make a call. But they're all huge compared to a proper dirt bike - the KLR and DR650 are decent dirt focused compromises for road/trail touring.  </TEXT>

I think the Cavs thought Bennett might be useful faster - but he buckled like a baby giraffe under the pressure and hasn't looked remotely useful til this year. He's had a few games where he's looked like a bit of a force, he might still prove to be a good pickup for Minnesota. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're very kind. Here's another I wrote in the same job :

My lebanese wife's shiny locks
Sprout from armpits, back, arms and her box.
Her pubes are so long
And so thick and so strong
That she knits herself into her jocks.

You might think it's strange for a man
To permit so much hair on her can
But it brought us great mirth
At our eldest son's birth;
He came swinging out just like Tarzan.

I'll confess, though, I'm catching the bug;
Even though she's quite ticklish to hug -
And the 'stache on her gash
Sometimes gives me a rash -
It's like rooting a fine persian rug. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's a 4-stanza mini-epic I threw together on a really boring job site once:

-----

My lesbian friend said "I'm horny, 

But fisting's beginning to bore me. 

With five fingers up it, 

I feel like a Muppet. 

I'm sick of my bitch speaking for me."

-----

I replied "the solution is clear. 

It's penis you're needin' my dear. 

They're built for the job, 

Plus they'll fit in your gob 

And I happen to have one right here!" 

-----

"What luck!" said the lass, "I might screw you. 

I've never been that fond of hoo-hoo; 

A big pair of tits, 

They're my favourite bits, 

And most men ain't got 'em - but YOU do! 

-----

I was slightly offended, but fark it - 

It's not every day I can park it. 

Most girls aren't impressed 

With my man-booby chest 

But it's big in the lesbian market.

<TEXT> For me, it was two things. Firstly every photo I saw on Flickr that I loved seemed to be coming out of the same camera, a full frame. The crops couldn't seem to keep up with the level of detail in sky and cloud areas. I'm not sure if it's dynamic range or what.

Secondly I'd bought the 24-105 lens after trying it on a full frame and didn't realise it wouldn't go as wide on a crop, so I was a bit of a drongo.

At the end if the day I just don't get the same feeling from shots taken on my 7D as I do with those from the 5D2. I'm very happy with the 5d and you can get em pretty cheap right now.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a motorcyclist, it's extraordinary just how much you can feel the difference when you get right up the bum of a truck. I've used it as a technique to squeeze the last few miles out of a low fuel warning, you need almost no power once you're in the draft.

Having said that, I've been playing with an adaptive cruise system lately in a test car, and that seems significantly less fuel efficient than the way I'd drive if I was operating the pedals. It slows down and speeds up quite aggressively to maintain the distance you choose from the car in front. I'd guess that early self driving cars, before they begin talking to one another, will be less energy efficient than fuel-conscious human drivers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> On the bike, it's a Sena 20S headset (SMH10 would be almost as good and cheaper), through a GP10 backpack thingy for the GoPro. Wind noise is cancelled to virtually zero, and the audio is synced straight up with the vision. You can also record intercom conversations if you're out with multiple riders.

It's a great motovlogging setup, being able to talk on the bike means I don't have to shoot nearly as much footage off the bike as I used to - so I'm less reliant on having a cameraman around!

<TEXT> The one dunk I ever got in a basketball game. I should add, it was a D-grade women's game and I was refereeing at the time. 

I'd spent several hours a day between the ages of 17 and 20 obsessed with trying to dunk. But as a 5'11 white guy the odds were stacked against me. Still, when the stars aligned I could get up there, I just couldn't quite palm the ball to get it down. A volleyball? No worries. A netball? I was throwing those down like Dr. J. Basketballs just eluded me. 

So there I am, bored out of my mind reffing this game, and one of the girls lumbers out on a "fast" break. I'm jogging behind her, the layup goes up, time slows down and my pupils dilate. 

I saw the sit - the ball was going to teeter on the front of the rim. I could just feel it. And instinct kicked in. I wasn't going to miss my chance. 

I took three quick steps and launched, grabbed the ball, and slammed it down with all my strength, shouting like a caveman. I landed triumphantly, threw my head back and hollered. 

And then I saw the confused faces of the players, blew my whistle and gave somebody a sideball. 

Best part was, as we got started again a kid on the sideline burst out in tears, wailing "no Jordans! No Jordans! "

Made my year.  </TEXT>

I haven't ridden the FZ09 yet - it's on the list - but you can pick those old Hornets up super cheap in my part of town and I'm forever looking at them in the paper and going "hmmmmm..."

The Speed Triple, if you can stretch for one of those, is the [best bike in the whole world ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDNrRX6EzWA). </TEXT>

<TEXT> My theory is that people see crystal clear photos and don't have the emotional response that they get from old photos. A lot of stylistic processing emulates the problems inherent in shit cameras, old film or old photos and that resonates with people's desire to reminisce. It gives the photos a kind of aged credibility. It's odd.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Canon 24-105 Error 01 - anybody successfully replaced their aperture ribbon? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-02-25 07:02:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Symptoms are as follows: Lens seems to work normally at 24mm, but as you zoom in, the IS and aperture start to jump around wildly. I believe this is an issue with the flexible communications ribbon that connects to the aperture control ring. Canon Australia wants $480 to repair it... That's ludicrous, especially given that you can get a whole new lens for $700 in some places.

I've found a second hand aperture ring with a new ribbon soldered on and I want to have a crack at making the repair, but I understand it's easy to knock certain lens elements out of alignment in the process. Has anyone opened one of these lenses up, and do you have any tips for me? </TEXT>

You know, looking back on it, there were some great dunks but the competition itself has always been a joke. Nique's two handed windmill with his head over the rim scores 45 and Jordan gets a 50 for the same dunk he did in the semi round? C'mooonnnn. As a kid this was a really huge thing, but looking at it now, I kind of understand why the name players wouldn't bother with it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like the Hawks should take this one as a moral victory. Durant made a huge shot at the end, but it was immediately preceded by a bitch-ass push off no call and a rip-through. I reckon we should be able to expect more from KD.

I wanted OKC to win, but... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avr7enrZuJQ

Hawks' offense made a fool of the Thunder through the first 3 quarters, every basket seemed like an easy one, where the Thunder were struggling to get shots off and making some really tough looks. GG Hawks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You start with the body - tall, lean, strong. Unbelievable athleticism, the league had never really seen anybody who could just hang in the air so long. Watch the old game tapes, Jordan would elevate for a shot, wait for the defenders to drop out of the air, then shoot right over the top, have a coffee and come down. His hands were gigantic too, he could palm the ball at will, giving him amazing control on the dribble, or in the air, or grabbing steals. And his speed was absolutely stunning, in the open court he had an extra gear that nobody could keep up with. 90% of the time he looked like a coiled spring, running conservatively, but then he'd explode and it was amazing to watch.

Then there was the offensive skills - his touch was absolutely ridiculous, nobody has ever come close. He'd make layups the league has still never seen again, changing his mind two or three times in the air and kissing it in with a little spin off the backboard. His post game was just unreal to watch, that turnaround fadeaway was so deadly. He was an absolutely electric scorer, if the ball was in MJ's hands something amazing could happen at any second. Excellent vision, too, finding teammates or punishing a sloppy double - and if he got a sniff of the rim, he'd rise up and posterize ANYBODY in his way.

You could talk about defense - that sprung from his ridiculous motor. The guy was just ON all the time, an absolute energy factory and there were rumours he'd party all night and turn up and still demolish you. He was a constant threat on defense, not just on his own man, but a demon in the passing lanes for steals and most games he'd have one or two out-of-nowhere flying blocks as well. 

The competitive spirit and iron will just burned in him, he was the ultimate win-at-all-costs psychopath, to the point where it almost looks like it's ruining his life after basketball. He took *everything* personally, in fact if there was the tiniest reason to get pissed off with somebody, he'd make it his mission to destroy and humiliate them, and more often than not, these were his best games. Having said that, he never took a game off. You see LeBron and the heat coasting during the regular season - that would never happen on a Bulls squad, they just had a fire inside. 72 wins in one regular season is evidence of that.

And on top of all this and his many other gifts, he was also the most stylish player ever to take the court. Everything he did just looked so damn beautiful and in control. He was loose and fluid, but incredibly strong and athletic at the same time. If you played ball in the 80s and 90s, you'd see so much of MJ's style in the other kids - tongues out, scoop reverse layups, jumpman leg splits, people just wanted to be him. It sure didn't hurt that his Nike PR team concealed what a knob he was from the public so impeccably. 

So yeah - perfect storm. Outstanding physical gifts, unparalleled drive to improve and win, smart, skilled, creative, unstoppable and more marketable than pretty much anything the world has seen since. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm editing a multi-camera live concert video that was shot with a bunch of DSLRs and a BMCC. The BMCC has vastly superior image quality, but as the night goes on, it seems to have developed a dozen or more hot pixels that show up as white or coloured dots and are quite noticeable on a black background.

Any ideas on how to make them less noticeable? Thanks in advance guys! </TEXT>

<TEXT> So we've been using sennheiser in ear monitors for the last 12 months or so, with the stock earbuds, and recently I had a chance to use the same radio pack and microphones with a set of shure earbuds. I didn't see what model they were, but they absolutely blew me away, the sound was just crystal. Full and clear. 

So as I hunt around for earbud options, I thought I'd consult the pros here - have you guys found nirvana in a stage earphone? What should I check out?

<TEXT> An update to the thread I posted last week...

So today my band and I taped our Starking appearance. We sang with Girl's Day - at least, three of them, Minah must have known I'm dangerous and stayed away.

I never realized just how young those girls are - but they were totally charming, super professional and heaps of fun. Then we did a couple of songs with Brown Eyed Girls, who came across as... Sort of grumpy.

I don't know how our singing went, but we had an awesome time with the new hosts, Boom and Teuk (ex super junior) and it was a pretty damn hilarious day all up, once all the waiting around was out of the way. They seemed to think we kicked some butt, so who knows, it could lead us somewhere. :)

it's going to air in late November, I'll get a copy when I can and stick it on YouTube - but yeah, I thought you guys would appreciate what a crazy day I just had! :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> I sing with an Australian a cappella group, we're in Korea quite regularly, this will be our third visit this year. One of the things we love to incorporate in our show is bad imitations of k-pop songs, it's pretty funny since we're all guys.

Long story short, some TV producers saw us singing Twinkle Twinkle earlier this year and they've invited us to do a broadcast later this week.... And it seems like they're bringing Girl's Day in for the show as well. I have no idea what's going to happen, but I'm pretty sure it's going to be hilarious. :)

Wish us luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm starting to shout at my telly now, having just come through the Vice section. The evidence is so weak and the questions so vague at this point of the game that you're more or less just guessing in interrogations. Even when you get questions right, you seem to get bugger-all in return. And it doesn't matter if you stuff every question up, the game goes on. It's like a movie in which you twiddle a thumbstick every now and then to get to the next scene.

The action is pretty ordinary and formulaic, the driving is both boring and unnecessary, the city has little in it that makes me want to explore further, the main character is a bit of a prat... Sure, the stories are great and the character animations fantastic - but the gameplay is so fucking irritating that I'd probably be happier if I left it alone and never finished it.

Next to Red Dead Redemption, this feels like a gimmicky vehicle for the awesome animation work of Team Bondi, a half way step towards future games that might put the technology to better use. But that might just be me. </TEXT>

We've shot interviews and the like from 2 angles and want to be able to cut back and forth between vision from the two cameras - but it seems they shoot in slightly different frame rates.

If I create a 25fps sequence and just drop in the 23.975fps footage, does Premiere CS5 just sort frame rate issues out? Or do I need to process it somewhere else? Oh, and sorry if this is a stupid question! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys - just a quickie. I've been using prores transcoding in FCP, which does a great job of making 7D footage editable. Now I have to do a reasonably large project in CS5 - should I edit the 7D footage straight, or transcode it to something?

If I need to transcode it, can I do it using the Apple Compressor, or does Adobe have its own tool that works better? What format works best?

Cheers in advance! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys - and thanks for giving me the inspiration to get back to training after more than 10 years on my arse.

I went in and did my first squats, deads and press workout today, and ended up in a conversation with the guy running the place. I've got bad knees as a result of way too much basketball when I was younger, and I'm now carrying a lot of weight (~125kg) - getting my legs back in shape to support dodgy knees is the main reason SS appealed to me. I've been doing bodyweight broomstick squats at home for the last month or so.

The gym guy, an old fella who seems experienced in free weight training, is telling me I shouldn't jump straight into 5-rep heavy lifting in search of strength. That since I haven't been in a gym for 10 years I should spend at least a month doing low weights for 20-30 reps on things like leg extensions, unweighted or low weight bar squats and the like, in order to prepare my tendons and ligaments for the stress, that if not, I'm risking a blowout at the squat rack with severe consequences.

This seems to go against what Rippetoe says in SS - that the squat is not only the perfect conditioner of connective tissue, but that done properly, it shouldn't be dangerous. The way I read it, he seems to be saying learn the right forms and get straight into it. I'm confused... Help! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So we're replacing a band member, and have found one strong candidate who seems to have a lot of the attributes we need - a rare combination. But his groove is non-existant - too much time in the classical world I think.

I've got time to spend with him if we decide he's our man, but I wonder what you guys' experiences are. Is groove innate or can it be trained? Will I be pushing shit uphill if I try to train him? And how would you go about it? Mixtapes? Metronomes? One-on-one sessions? 

Any ideas? </TEXT>

<TITLE> I had one of my nuts chopped off due to testicular cancer at age 28... And for anyone else that might be facing something similar, don't stress, it ain't so bad. AMA! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2010-05-20 04:35:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Thought I'd bring this one up because it always tends to flush out a bunch of other wonderfully horrific stories about how other dudes lost THEIR knackers. 

SO:

I was lucky, because my nut started to hurt. In most cases, testicular cancer is absolutely painless, which lets it grow and spread to the lymph nodes, lungs and eventually the brain (which is the state it got to before Lance Armstrong did anything about it).

In my case, it was caught early because I'm a rabid motorcyclist and was learning to pull wheelies. When you're learning wheelies, you tend to smack the bike down and bash yourself in the nads a lot. The best guess of the docs is that weeks of testicular trauma due to mousetrapped wheelies had caused a minor bleed into a tumour that was growing in ol' righty. The bleed caused it to swell until the nut was twice its normal size, it hurt like a thousand bastards and I got it diagnosed. So it could be said that wheelies may have saved my life. Honestly, officer.

Apparently most cases of testicular cancer are discovered by the missus, in the bath. Or so I'm told.

The rest of the process was fairly simple. They chop out the diseased bollock (though it's not a simple case of cut the ol' scrotum and pull it out, they actually go in from your stomach, below your navel and off to the side, go figure), you go stash some wigglies at the sperm bank and then go for a short round of chemotherapy, which has a 50% chance of permanently sterilising you.

Chemo sucks, in my case it was just one IV bag of one chemical, carboplatin, which is so toxic that the nurse carries it in wearing elbow-length gloves. A nice touch. The treatment took 45 minutes, after which I had to go sing a gig. That was interesting. It left me with no appetite or energy for weeks, and for the next 3-4 years I felt kind of foggy in the head, as if I was thinking through cotton wool. I can only imagine things are worse for people who have to go through longer treatments - Armstrong is a good example, he had to have five or six, the poor bugger. With just one treatment, I didn't even lose any hair.

Anyway, I didn't find the process overly scary, and apart from the annoying effects of chemo, I can honestly say that one nut works just as well as two (the missus tested it out just hours after surgery). Looks a bit odd, mind you, but then the frank 'n' beans have never struck me as particularly pleasing to look at, even in the best of times.

So hopefully if there's anyone out there that's just copped a nasty shock, found a lump or had a diagnosis, I can reassure you a bit. There's plenty of blog posts, articles and whatnot on the net where fellas make a big deal out of losing one ball, what it means to their manhood, and generally make it sound very scary. It doesn't have to be, though, and your life will go on just fine. The guy at [www.mybollox.com](www.mybollox.com) has a pretty healthy attitude about it all (and incidentally, the same doctor as I had).

As for the rest of you, if this post gets you to fondle your nuts or the nuts of somebody you care about, I'd consider that a win for everyone. Even if you don't find anything.

Fire away! </TEXT>
