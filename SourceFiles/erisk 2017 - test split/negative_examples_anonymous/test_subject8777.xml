<TEXT> Song is dope man, the layering is pretty spot on. the vocal is in the mix pretty well too, maybe bus everything but the vocals to a compressor to give your voice and the mix a little separation but your delivery is on point man! </TEXT>

<TEXT> the beat is pretty cool, but sparse and lacking some low end.. just an old timey sample with drums behind it...maybe throw in a bassline or some subsonic shit to give it some bottom. The song itself is pretty good tho, and your voice sounds good too. the delivery is pretty decent however you might want to try doing a beat that is a little faster instead of trying to drag out some of your phrasing, I think your voice would be better suited for something a little quicker. Maybe try to compress the vocals a little to settle them into the mix or even just bring the volume down a little. other than that the lyrics were good and definitely something to keep doing! </TEXT>

<TEXT> thanks for that man! Yea I boosted a little around 150-250hz range to bring out a little more of that low end and I was just now playing my bass to the song but it was real quick and didnt think to try an octave lower.. I am going to give it a try and I agree on the hats as well, I think I just needed to hear someone say it to me! Thanks brotha! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with jmilnazikmusic, flight to catch is a dope track. The intro is nice interesting making me want to hear more. But the drums do sound like they are limited. You can almost hear them hitting the ceiling. There is alot going on in the high end that makes some the hits a little hard to take when you are listening to it on headphones. That being said, maybe take the limiter off and try to compress the drums a little bit to set them apart from the track a little bit with a high pass filter side chained just to maybe eliminate some of those higher frequencies when the mix is getting louder. </TEXT>

<TEXT> super fluid man, I like all the percussion clicks and pops going on all over the place! The vocal sample (not of the singing in the beginning) came in super hot and surprised me a little. maybe dial down a little bit so it settles in the mix a little more. Very interesting man and a nice listen for sure! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like the raw sample feel to the song! Some of the scratches are a little off timing in the beginning but still nice sounding. I have to ask if it was you on the table? The swing to the song is nice as well and has a little bit of an interesting break in the middle and the kick was a little loud. All in all, I dug it!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gotta make your way up to the Owens river gorge area and the whitmore hot tubs.. valley in between two mtn ranges and you feel soo small its incredible! However, weekends can have a few other campers there. Did a trip to owens river gorge a couple months ago to climb and camped at the whitmore hot springs on a Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Sunday had a few people at the different hot springs but on Monday and Tuesday it was pretty sparse with people so it made for some nice alone time. From san Diego its a 5-6 hr drive up the 395 but totally worth it!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 420 has everything to do with weed. In the 70's there was a group of high school kids in San Rafael that got detention for a week straight. The detention let out at 420pm everyday and they would all get together then to smoke after their detentions. At that time, it was more about the time of day and not the date 4-20 but as time went on, both were adapted by the smoking culture. 

It has everything to do with weed, officially.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Tornados have always fascinated me, ever since I was a kid and I remember my parents getting this tornado home movies for me as a kid off of tv infomercials.. What I want to know is:

1. How did you curiosity for storms lead you to actually decide to start chasing them?

2. Any near death experiences, and if so, please explain.

3. Do you ever think about the fact that you are putting yourself in harms way and if so, do you chalk it up to doing it for science?

4. What's the gnarliest storm you have chased or witnessed?

5. What is it about storms that fascinate you the most?

6. After seeing all the destruction from storms, ever considering living in an area that doesn't have them as serve like say San Diego?

7. If I pay for my own way, can I come on a ride along for a week!?

Thanks so much! Looking forward to reading these!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am leaving on a 6mo contract next month with Royal Caribbean as an audio tech/stage hand and I still have some questions but the company is being quite vague with me. Here are some questions I have and feel free to let me know how your overall experience was as well! Thanks!
My 5 Questions:

I am a drummer and would not enjoy not being able to play for 6mo. Is there a staff lounge with say a piano and drum kit you can play?

How easy is it really to change rooms if you don't get along with your roommate?

How are the hours of work? I have heard many different things, anywhere from 12+hrs all week to some days are 12hr days and some are 2hr days.

Can you fast track yourself to a higher up position during your first contract? Can you do it at all?

Are you allowed off the ship when in port if there is no work to be had?

Thanks everyone! I look forward to some responses! It will help me out greatly :)

<TEXT> I honestly don't know if me having a gun would have made the situation better or worse. Trying to go for a gun when one is already drawn on you, unless you're a quick draw, I feel like it would do more harm than good.

I do not own a gun, have never fired a gun nor do I plan to purchase one for my own safety.. I don't feel like I live in an unsafe area even tho this happened to me. The police said it was the first armed robbery in over 10yrs to happen in the town so a freak incident. Altho I have been toying around with the idea of hunting for the last year or so..

After the robbery I was very hesitant to go back to work and my bosses actually wanted me to close the bar the very next day and I literally had to plea with then to give me the night off and they reluctantly did because I think they knew I would have just quit. I was able to talk to a counselor and therapist a couple times that the victims unit of my police department provided. I was having a hard time wrapping my head around the whole ordeal and why it had to happen to me and to a degree still am but I have kind of come to grips with the fact that it was a sign to start making moves in my life and have started to do just that. And yes, I still close the bar at night but am much more cautious and nervous when doing so, but I put my two weeks in tonight so not too much longer  </TEXT>

He could have done it so easily and my co worker didn't give him all the money (although the robber didn't know that) bt if he did that would have been all the reason he needed to do me in. When I think back about it, there are so many things I wish I would have done, but in the moment there was no chance I would have actually done it. But it is interesting to look at the situation from a few different ways in my head. I will have to check out that book tho, sounds interesting to me, especially now  </TEXT>

I am not the kind of person who has things really bother me after the fact, bt this shook me up and I didn't really want to go back to work right away. My bosses actually wanted me to close the next night which floored me and I literally had to plea with them to let me take the night off. Reluctantly they gave me the night off but it was like twisting their arm which kind of soured me on the establishment even more. I will say I am way more cautious/nervous closing now, but actually I put my two weeks tonight and got a new job. It's just too much of an uneasy feeling at my current job </TEXT>

<TEXT> At first when I saw him come from the back I thought it was a joke until he came right next to me and put the gun in my face and put his hand on my shoulder and pushed me to my knees and then down on my stomach and told me to stay there. What's funny tho is I have thought in the past if something like this was to happen to me, I would totally just knock the gun out of his hand and tackle the dude and blah blah blah but when it happened, none of those thoughts came into my head. The robber said if I moved, or saw the cops or didn't get all the money he was going to spray my head all over the floor and even though he got everything he came there for, I was about 90% sure I was going to die that night because he could have done it so easy.. And the only thing that was honestly going through my head was I didn't want to die and that it was very cold on the floor and not a place I wanted to die. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am a male and yes he barked orders at me to get on the ground bt at first I thought it was some sort of joke bt once the gun was in my face, I figured wasn't and at that point I told him to take it easy as I was getting on the ground and when he told me not to move as the gun was on my head I told him I wasn't going anywhere, so I guess we talked.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well the short of it is, I was closing up at the bar I work at in my little Mtn town I live in around 12am on a Friday. Guy came out the back, drew a gun on me and made me get to the floor while my co worker emptied the register.. All the while having the gun pressed to my temple as I lay on the ground.. Ask me anything, I can give more details and nothing is off limits.

<TEXT> The paper process is quite involved and there are a few ways of going about it. You can stake a claim on lands that the BLM have allowed for mineral harvesting. But you would need to check with the  LR2000 to make sure it's not already claimed and that is a whole process in itself! Talk to your county's mineralogist  and possibly visit the BLM offices, they will help you as much as they can..at least they did for us here in CA... 

You can also buy claims from people who are selling then but they tend to be a little more expensive but at least that way you are paying for the paperwork being done and just a transfer in title is all that is needed at that point and then putting up the proper signs on your claim.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> as a drummer who has played many shows in the past, DO NOT PLAY YOUR HARDEST SONG first.... that is horrible advice! Play the song that you and your band feel will keep people's attention and make them wanting more, that way you can get the audience into your music and band and if you fuck up down the line, chances are no one will notice. As opposed to playing your hardest song first (which to the average listener, they wont be able to tell) and possibly fucking it up and having that be the thing people remember because it was your first song. 

In the end, put together a set that will keep people interested, and that doesnt necessarily mean playing your hardest song first.

Bring lots of sticks and keep a rag near by for those sweaty palms because with it being your first gig, no matter how calm and collected you are, you gunna get the nervous sweats

Make friends with the front of house engineer too, he ultimately holds the fate of your band for that club in his hands....saying hello and offering to help with any kind of stage set up really does go a long way.

bring lots of sticks and dont drink too much before the stage, being drunk at your own gig is over played

AND REMEMBER, have as much fucking fun as possible and keep telling yourself this is why we all got into gigging in the first place! 

Good luck brotha! Whats the name of your band?

<TEXT> Thank you, ya sometimes it is hard to find that balance. With this genre of music there tends to be a lot of repetitiousness and so we try not to do too much of it because without lyrics it can start to get monotonous. Thank you for the feed back tho! Take a listen to our newest song, it is our Frankenstein song with some post rock, math rock and post hardcore influence [Caterpillar Harvest](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BIdyxmSiV0) </TEXT>

<TEXT> The structure of the song is good and the lyrical content is there, but as at as the mix goes there are a couple things that could be done. I am glad to see you are a fellow logic user tho :) the vocals sound like they could be compressed a little more, just to smooth them out and sit them in the mix a little nicer. The snare also seems to have a bit of a long tail on the reverb when it is hit, or it could be the natural decay of the snare, but either way tightening up a gate a little on it might make it sound a little less muddy..but then again sometimes that's nice to have. </TEXT>

You sound a bit like [MC Paul Barman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC_Paul_Barman) and [Atmosphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_(music_group) the lyrics are good with a good sense of timing about them. Te beat is pretty good too just needs to have the drums drop in a little harder! I'd love to put some drums to this track! Nicely done, hope to hear more! </TEXT>

<TEXT> This track sounds real good! The drops are solid and the build ups are nice and fluid..I get a little bit of some weird phantom frequencies around the 2-3k range but I am also listening with Grado's and they hear everything too well haha... Maybe try side chaining an low end oscillator to your kick on the drops to give it a little more DROP.. The track is awesome tho man, quite the listening experience! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like the track very different sounding..the only thing I would say is with the way that the vocals are mixed, very light and airy with tons of reverb, I almost wanted to hear some solid drums in the track, at least something at would drop at some point, just to give the track some continuity...nothing to crazy but a simple electronic beat or a minimal DnB beat would suffice, just because it feels as tho that would keep the interest of the listener a little more, but that's just IMHO. Keep up the good work! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just listened to the song and I really like the guitar work..it is busy bt not overwhelming which is what I like... I think if you were to find the right drummer for it to keep it busy and interesting bt at the same time able to come back to a solid rhythm, I think the song could have a real math/indie rock feel to it...I am a drummer and would love to record something to it for fun! I will definitely be jamming to it later either way! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I totally understand the whole money thing...studios tend to take advantage of pple who are new to the recording game and to be honest you could have gotten the same sound prolly for free from some recording arts student who is looking for bands to track...i recorded some awesome bands while i was in school using that method and you would be surprised how much cooler pple are when there is no money involved! Im a 26yr old audio engineer with some good vision. Id love to mix your track if you have the ability to get the session file or at least the individual tracks. I do alot of mixing at my studio at home and would love to toy around with some different stuff if youre into it. Not looking to get paid, bt if the mix comes out well, id love to be able to use it on my audio resume...let me know what you are thinking and also with your vocals being out of key, that is a relatively easy fix for me with some of the programs i use...let me know..message me back on here and we can figure it all out! My name is alex btw </TEXT>

<TEXT> hey man! glad that you got a recording done in a studio! Such a good feeling! its a good track, but it sounds like the guitars are really compressed hard, especially during the distortion parts..it sounds like it is just slammed and really sucks the life out of the guitar tracks...the vocals are also very very in front of the mix, which i guess is good in some instances but it could prolly be mixed back a bit because the singer tends to stress some of his vocals at times. other than that it sounds good and keep rocking! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unfortunately tho bro..justin machado took that photo of me yesterday and i went out with him and 4 other close friends as his family is good family friends from high school bc he was my teacher...so i was with someone who knows what they are doing and was giving me great advice... the broken board was my own doing...ive grown up around surfing, seen it everyday in the water while i was on a sponge and have been in the water probably more in my life than on land... so i am not charging out on big waves not knowing what i am doing...i am riding waist high white wash trying to understand the feeling and mechanics of the board under my feet before taking it to an area full of surfers...being a sponger i know how surfers view someone who doesnt know what they are doing so i am not being irresponsible by just charging out like it is no thing...having lost people to the water, i understand it is not something to be taken lightly so please do not assume you know how I am approaching this because everything I do is always very calculated..

And stop using the word Kook, its unbecoming...  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hahaha ur right bro. What was I thinking...And learning on white wash u are right, Im so in your way and complete nuisance. It's all good, i don't set foot in PB, so you can claim that for yourself..I'll take a break at wind n sea, table tops, boneyards, hell even beacons or any other break in NC over PB any day so that's all yours man..

If your worried about a "kook" stealing ur wave, don't trip. I have lived here my whole life and have been in the water for most of it just not surfing, so I know my etiquette. But I will say out of everyone I've talked to about this learning experience, you sir have been the biggest Richard of them all, so I say good day to you </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you soo much :) it is very heart warming to have all this support..we really hope that once the album is done we can give it to enough people where it can just start to spread around to anyone who enjoys good music and we feel that with not having vocals we appeal to a more global audience while still maintaining a humbling sound :) glad you like it tho and I am always happy to talk music with anyone! Be on the look out for the new album coming soon, check the website periodically and facebook too :) thanks again! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I appreciate that. I am sure the other guys would feel the same way if they were here right now. We try to leave a lot up to the listener and allow them to really make what they want of it. The parts that grab you are intended to do exactly that and the rest is up to the listener :) be on the look out for the new album. Once its done I will put it online for free download to anyone who wants it. I will probably put a post on reddit for it :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> To that i would say we are not trying to go for that wow factor all the time as we would like to see our music be used for things such as movies, commercials, sports films..etc so we like to leave space in the music and without a singer we understand that there isnt always something there that will grab and hold the occasional post rock listener, but that is ok for us. The songs have their moments that grab you and thats all we want, the rest is up to you :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> oh well yea man ride the college train as long as you can, no point in fucking up school for minimum wage anyway. Everyone says find a job you love and get paid for it, but thats kind of bullshit in my mind. Find a job to survive and do the things you love because you love them, even if it doesnt pay.. </TEXT>
