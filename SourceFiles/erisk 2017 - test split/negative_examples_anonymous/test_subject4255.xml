<TEXT> I'm on chapter 24 of RPO and the one criticism I have is some of the language seems a bit forced. Like 'maxxed' being written with two Xs or poser being spelled "posuer" and the lack of words like "pwned" and "noob" and this particular phrase irked me like no other "Sux0rs can go fuck a duck."

It seems a bit childish and something I've never experienced in MMORPG games. 

Why did you choose this language? Also, why the time period? I feel like games were *just* getting started in the 80s and the 90s - 2000s had more to offer.  </TEXT>

I'm Jim from the Chicken Nugget Manufacturing Association of America! I have noted your complaint and in a unanimous decision, the members of the CNMAA have decided to reduce the nugget count in our packaging by one in an effort to please the consumer. However, we will not change the pricing.

<TEXT> I've been there, OP. I think at some point we all have or we all will be.  

The important thing you must realize is that life is about you. You want change? Go get it. Don't sit idly by waiting for it to come because change never just appears.  

Are there people in your life that constantly make you feel down? Get rid of them. At one point I had to cut communication off with family members because they were poison for my mind. Toxic people only help to make you ill.  

This life is about you. Do what you need.  

I'd love to give more specific advice. Please PM me. Let's get through this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My SO and I split 5 weeks ago. The first two weeks were an absolute nightmare. The third week was much better and now I'm doing just fine.  

Same sort of situation too. 3 years together, she came from money, I didn't. She wanted to be engaged, I don't have the money. She just got her masters degree and is set to live with her parents for a year. We fought about stupid stuff all the time.  

As much as I hated to see her go, in the end it was for the best.   

I was able to finally do what I wanted: move out of Texas. Now I have a job lined up in DC that I will start at the beginning of next month.  

A great book that is helping me get through this is called "How to Survive the Loss of a Love" and I have a copy that I am more than willing to send to you.  

It can be a little preachy at times (I'm not sure if you are religious or not, if you aren't, just look past it) but overall it really puts things into perspective. It taught me to focus on me now.

Sanders, who opposed the Patriot Act and its reauthorization, said he plans to **vote against** the less-wide-ranging USA Freedom Act, passed last month by the House, which would allow some counterterrorism tools  including the NSAs controversial bulk data collection  to remain in place.  

And just in case you don't know exactly what the USA Freedom Act really is:

<TEXT> Remember the first time Rand Paul filibustered and the top article on Reddit's front page was about it? Remember the first comment? Here's a refresher in case you don't:  

"And Bernie voted YES!"  

That was a load of horse shit. Bernie voted yes for cloture. That means he voted yes to having a vote. He did not vote yes on the bill itself.    

Whatever user made that comment is a smart cookie. He knew reddit never actually reads articles or confirms them with their own research. So what we got was everyone shouting "BERNIE SUPPORTS DOMESTIC SPYING?" when in reality they should've been shouting "BERNIE SUPPORTS THE ABILITY TO VOTE ON THIS BILL!?" which doesn't sound as circlejerky. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was a little shit in elementary school.   

In 5th grade my mother, sister, and I moved out to a rural area from an urban area because my parents separated.   

Coming from an urban school I had this shitty mentality that I was smarter than all of the rural kids. I wasn't very nice to my classmates or teacher. I was a really shitty kid.  

Anyhow, I had a terrible problem turning assignments in, so bad that my teacher did not allow me to participate in the honors program at my school. Naturally I was angered by her actions and over the next couple of days disrespected her constantly! She finally had the last straw, grabbed my arm and dragged me to the front office to retrieve my mother's contact information that was located in a rolodex on a form all students turned in at the beginning of the year.  

She's spinning and searching and finally located my form...

"OF COURSE!" she exclaimed "It's a blank piece of paper because you never turn anything in!"

I just smirked devilishly. 


She brought me back to the classroom and told me to call my mother from the classroom phone. I started to punch in a bunch of random numbers and professed that I didn't remember it (I was lying).

TL;DR: I was a little shit.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I was able to test the part. It functioned accordingly. The problem went away for a bit but I decided to retest the error codes.  

It still said 14. Anyhow, I immediately started the engine in order to run the car for a bit (with the paper clip still in the connector) and the car jumped then completely shut down. Now the dash isn't getting any power, turning the key does nothing. No lights, no A/C, nothing.  

What did I do wrong? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Could old fuel be causing this issue? When it finally gave out it was about 3/4th of the way full. Anyway to responsibly dispose of that gas so I can fill it with fresh gas?   

What's the best way (and cheapest) to look for leaks in the vacuum?   

I have checked around to make sure no wires have been chewed up: all clear.

I cleaned the throttle body like 3 years ago and I recently cleaned the IACV. MAybe I should get a new IACV? </TEXT>

<TEXT> You PM him/her over a period of months until you gain their trust. You find out that they actually live in the same city as you, in fact, just a couple of blocks down. You share pictures of yourselves with each other, slowly piecing together your independent lives. You find that you have similar interests including vast collections of fedoras, novelty swords, and NES cartridges. You muster up the courage to let them know you have feelings for them. You find that they share the same feelings towards you. You share more intimate photographs with each other leading into ending every night with a message in your inbox that says "Goodnight, I love you, I can't wait to meet you."

You decide to take the initiative and set up a date together. You invite them out to the local Hilton restaurant for a fancy meal followed by a night out on the town on Monday, April 20th, 2015 at 6:00pm Central Standard Time.

You wait until the eve of that fateful night and never leave your driveway.  </TEXT>

I was a little curious after the shampoo washed out of my hair, down my face, and into my mouth. It was very salty!  

Then I noticed that the shower gel is the same consistency! Naturally, I was curious about its taste so I tried it to compare. SAME FLAVOR, super salty!  

That's when I looked at the ingredients. They are the same!

<TEXT> It's because their last emperor's surname was Nguyen and it changing your family surname to match was respectful.

[Source](http://www.ibtimes.com/why-are-so-many-vietnamese-people-named-nguyen-1556359)

By the early 19th century century, the Nguyen Dynasty seized power in Vietnam (which unified the country), prompting yet another wave of surname changes and adoptions. That dynasty, which "awarded" their surname to many people, ruled the country until the end of World War II. Esther Tran Le, a Vietnamese-American journalist based in New York, said that the name Nguyen was the last name of the last dynasty of Vietnamese emperors. Apparently the last King's name was Bao-Dai, but his real name was Nguyen-Vinh-Thu, she said. Many of the Vietnamese [peoples] last names derive from the former Emperors' last names. </TEXT>

You should visit my town sometime and slap some sense into restaurant owners around here. I swear we are becoming the burger joint capitol of the work. I think we have at least 13 mom-and-pop burger places for our 40,000 people.  

A taco joint shut down and now someone bought the building and is turning it into ANOTHER BURGER PLACE...  

We have no diversity! It's all burgers or Latin American food!

Honestly, I'm not sure about the IP address. I would assume no. What I meant by that in the post is that there is a survey site we were considering that had an option to only allow one vote from one IP address. 

This poses an issue when it comes to schools and business. Effectively one vote can determine an entire school's opinion. We wanted to avoid that. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello /r/gifs users! 

We've been receiving a lot of mod mail from you all regarding 'Power Users' (i.e. those who post content to /r/gifs 20-30 times a day). The complaint stems from other users' inability to submit content to our subreddit and collect the karma that these posts accumulate. 

We've decided to create a survey and let you all decided if we should enact a post limit for users. 

Please take five minutes out of your day to answer! There are two  questions that are mandatory and the rest are silly questions we've come up with to get to know our user base a little better.

The survey is open for all to submit answers to but **PLEASE ONLY SUBMIT IT ONCE**. We had the option to use a feature that only allows one vote from an IP address or allows only users with a Google account to vote BUT we decided that these features would hinder our users' votes. 

**[LINK TO SURVEY](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1otfolOwCvjhUVtLo8lwvO5z3iZGWjkCm43b2XrMqIy8/viewform?usp=send_form)**

Thank you so much for your participation in this community and survey. It means a lot!

Sincerely,

test_subject4255

EDIT: I guess I should have mentioned a date at which the polling ends. How about a week from today? 

Polling ends 4/23/2015 at 12:00pm Central Standard Time. 

EDIT 2: **POLLING HAS ENDED. RESULTS WILL BE GIVEN SOON** </TEXT>

<TEXT> [REQUEST] GTA V


I know. It's posted as a request nonstop. Let me tell you why I'm different! I'm not.

I just simply don't have the money to purchase a game that I know I will enjoy. I've been a huge fan of the franchise and put a lot of hours into GTA: San Andreas when I had it for Xbox. I never really appreciated GTA: IV because I'm a big fan of flying airplanes and I feel like Liberty City is confined.

San Andreas has been my favorite one out of the series because of its size and GTA: V is the closest sequel that mimics it. I want to rob stores, steal fighter jets, take flying lessons, etc. and I know this game will offer it all to me.

Plus, my SO would be ecstatic considering we first connected with her love of driving down sidewalks.

Thank you for considering me.

If you just try and realize what conditions need to be like for you to willfully take the life of endangered species maybe you'd see that it's probably not what they want to do but is what they must do in order to survive.

On the same note, there is a market for what they do. If you destroy the demand the supply will go with it. This is something that the Chinese government is trying to work on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Kevin, here is a comment you made about the Ferguson protestors (I'll hyperlink it so you can click it and be taken to the source):

[Ferguson riots have very little to do with the shooting of the young man. It is an excuse to be the losers these animals truly are. **It is a tipping point to frustration built up over years of not trying, but blaming everyone else, The Man, for their failures.** It's always someone else's fault when you give up. Hopefully this is a reminder to the African Americans \( I always thought we just Americans. Oh, well.\) that their President [they] voted in has only made things worse for them, not better.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/21/kevin-sorbo-ferguson-animals-losers_n_5697647.html)

My questions is as follows:  

In regards to the selection I have bolded: Do you really believe that African Americans are not at a disadvantage in our (American) society? Enslaved for hundreds of years, [falsely reported as inferior by pseudo-scientific studies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism#United_States:_slavery_justified), segregated after emancipation, subjected to [institutional racism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_racism#United_States) (especially in Ferguson, MO as cited by a [DOJ report](http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/04/ferguson_police_department_report.pdf)), constantly bashed by conservative media, etc. After all of the history and examples I have linked, do you still believe they are simply "not trying"?

<TEXT> The first panic attack I ever had was when I lit up my first joint. My heart started racing and I felt like I was losing control.   

I kept jumping up and down saying "you see, it's not a dream because you're not flying."

I continued to touch everything I could because I was convinced that I was dreaming. I went to bed that night and I wasn't the same for months. I was in constant dismay about reality. I would have panic attacks. 'Inception' struck a chord and I haven't watched the movie since.   

Then I was with a close friend and I started projecting my issues to him. He said: 

"You know, test_subject4255, even if we are living in a dream, isn't it the best dream ever?"

I haven't forgot that since. 

I was convinced that I just had a laced joint so I had to prove to myself that it was a fluke. I've smoked twice since (over a 6 year period) and I have had some good experiences. Things that really turned my mind around. I don't plan on using it again because it's really not my taste but I'm glad I got over my fear. I haven't had a panic attack since.  

Anyway, I know that you're probably trying to find a connection between your current state and my story and I just wanted to let you know that it is MORE THAN OKAY to reach out to supportive loved ones/friends about your issues. Who knows? One of them might make you feel a ton better.   

Edit: I am not condoning the usage of marijuana. This is just simply my story about a bout of depression I experienced. If you are medically depressed, I am also not condoning skipping of meds/holistic cures/not getting treated. Some people are born with chemical imbalances that medication can help with.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Meatballs**  

* 1 roll spicy country pork sausage   
* 1 roll spicy Italian sausage   
* Handful of chopped arugula   
* Large handful of cubed or shredded mozzarella   
* Sea salt to taste (I used smoked salt) 

Form meatballs and place in a hot skillet. Cook until halfway done  

**Broth**   

* 1 medium carrot 
* 4ish green onions   
* 1 stick of celery   
* 1/2 stick of butter   
* Bullion or broth of your choice  
* 1 Chayote squash  
* 1 chicken thigh, chopped ham, or bacon   
* 1 jalapeno   
* 1 gallon of water   
* Sea salt to taste

Get pot hot and toss in butter, chopped carrot, jalapeno, green onion, and celery. Mix occasionally and let it come together, about five minutes Chop chicken and add it, cook halfway and add the water. Add bullion to taste.

Toss in chopped squash and bring water to a good simmer. Let simmer until flavors come together. Add meatballs and grease from pan.   

Cook until meatballs are done.  

Dish, top with parmesan cheese and cilantro (or arugula if you don't like cilantro)  
**Enjoy!**  

The squash is about 4.5-5 net carbs   
Arugula is 2 carbs per cup  
Carrot about 3 carbs   
Celery is about 2 carbs   
Green onions are 2 per onion  

One pot of soup (21 - 24 carbs) made at least six bowls for me, so the carbs are spaced out pretty well (3.5-4 carbs per serving). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I there with you. I've had HBP since I was 18. I'm 25 now. Stress was an important factor but my HBP didn't go down until I changed my diet. 

I'm not sure what will work for you but I started cutting carbs out and it made a huge difference. I know it sounds weird because fat (for a long time) has been thought to cause heart problems. I have (in my experience) found it to be the opposite. I'm on a high-fat low-carb diet and I've never felt better. Keep in mind, I count calories too. Too many and you'll gain more weight. 

Everytime I mention the following subreddit I get downvoted, but you should check out /r/keto. Now ketosis is used mainly by super overweight people as a weight loss program (they'll lose like 20lbs a month). I'm a 5'9" 180lb male and I just use it as a diet program. I eat red meat, chicken, vegetables, etc. I try to eat a lot of fiber and healthy fats. It's helped my blood pressure and heart rate immensely. With the diet you lose out on potassium and magnesium and you'll have to take supplements. You also need to drink a lot of water. 

Exercise is important also. I try to walk everywhere I go but I'm not super active (I really should be).  </TEXT>

<TITLE> TIFU by informing a neighbor of their death. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-23 05:56:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Like most TIFUs this didn't actually happen today. This happened 8 years ago. 

I grew up in the south Austin area and some new gang members from California had moved into the area. I wasn't involved in gang activity but I knew a lot of kids that were. 

One day I was walking home from a friends house and a truck pulls up to me with a couple of guys asking where my neighbor was. I told them I didn't know and they said that if I found out, let him know they're looking for him.

The next day in school I find out that they had a pistol on them and so I inform my neighbor's sister that they intend to kill her brother. I ask her to leave my name out of the mix when she confronts the principle about the problem but... she fails to do so.

A couple of days go by and I jump into bed and feel a cold piece of metal at my feet. I go to look at it and it's the head of a bullet. Then I start seeing holes in my walls. I lived in a trailer home (I had the middle most room, the trailer was facing the street [like this](http://i.imgur.com/d8zsEne.png)) and that bullet and two others had ripped through about 4 walls of my home. One hit a top bar of my bunk bed and fell into the bottom bunk. One ripped through the bathtub, my dresser drawer and landed in my box fan, and the other hit the bottom skirting of my house, landing underneath it. 

One bullet passed above me and my sister and the other below us. I never heard the shots (it must have been fired in the middle of the night a couple of nights before) and I never found out who did it. I called the cops, found the brass casings, but nothing ever came of it. We lived in the poor side of town so I didn't expect much. 

tl;dr: snitched and almost got stitched. 

Edit: Dangit! I meant to edit the title before I hit 'submit'. My neighbor ended up living. They backed off after his sister got the police and principle involved.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Over goddamn eggs </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-17 05:27:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> How the fuck could I let myself get all worked up over eggs?  

My SO and I live together with a 3rd roommate. We'll call my SO "Lilly" and our roommate "Cindy".  

Lilly and I pretty much share almost nothing. When we shop together I buy stuff I need and she buys stuff she needs. Now with certain products, we'll rotate purchase. Eggs especially. I'll buy them one time and she'll get the next time, etc.  

Recently she's been shadowing a teacher that has about 80 chickens and she will give Lilly a dozen almost every week. So now we don't have to buy eggs because we're getting a steady supply of delicious farm-fresh eggs... until right now.  

Spring break was last week so we didn't get our weekly dozen. When I checked the carton yesterday we had 2 left, enough for a breakfast. So this evening I'm getting all excited because I figure I'll eat the two tomorrow morning and then when Lilly and I go to the store tomorrow evening, I'll buy a dozen. So as we're winding down in bed I ask Lilly "hey, will you make sure I get up at 7:30 tomorrow? I want to eat breakfast." Now mind you, I'm not a big breakfast guy. I'm trying to get in the habit of it because I'm always so unproductive in the mornings.   

Lilly says "Sure, but there's only one egg left and I'm taking it for lunch tomorrow."   


WHAT. "Lilly, why didn't you tell me we were down to our last egg?"  

"Well you never eat breakfast, megabenson." (Fair point)

"But but... Dammit! Now I have go to the store now and buy more!"   

So I get up, put my shit on, and head outside to my car. Except I'm blocked in by Cindy and my next door neighbors and Cindy is fast asleep.   

I get so damn mad! OVER SOMETHING SO SMALL.   

Mind you, I wasn't mad at my SO. I was mad because now I'm going to be hungry tomorrow morning and all I have are a few slices of ham and 0 eggs...   

Man fuck this. So fucking stupid.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> A friend of mine gave it to me. He installed it via flash drive on my tower (I don't have a cd drive). He copied the installation files onto another flash drive (so just in case something like this happened) and gave me them. 

The product key might be within the folder I placed those files into but that folder is on the broken HDD.

Edit: I'm not sure if it was a genuine copy or not. It didn't seem ripped because there were no special hoops he had to jump through. 

I think I might just have to buy another copy of it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't understand why Windows 7 and 8.1 are the same price. The only thing I can think of is that they are trying their best to phase-out Windows 7. 

For how old Windows 7 is, I don't think $100 is a reasonable price so I'm looking to you all for help with this matter. Maybe you know of a not-so-common software shop that has copies or maybe you know about decent sales going on around the internet. 

Your help is greatly appreciated.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's found in a wide variety of powdered artificial sweeteners, from stevia to splenda. It's a starch and the ratio in stevia, splenda, is 1:1 so a 550 serving [bag of stevia](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/91hm25DmYML._SL1500_.jpg) will have 550g of carbs from maltodextrin. 

I know 1g carb per 1 tablespoon isn't a bad amount of carbs but I was startled when a friend of mine did the research. 

Anyhow, what do you think? </TEXT>

/s

Thank Obama for listening to the people. Thank him for representing our interests. 

Edit: We can also thank the populace for voting for Obama in 2012. I can't imagine how this decision would have turned out if Romney was elected. The majority of republicans were/are against net neutrality.  </TEXT>

Oh, I need to answer this. You can adjust the position of the nozzle to get the perfect shot at your keester. 

Also, I'd recommend buying a foot stool. If you put your feet on it while pooping, your body will form the natural position for pooping. This gets the poop out easier and is easier on your colon. It's way more comfortable too.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I cannot understand why Logic chose to audio morph these endings. 

I appreciate learning about different anecdotes about him and the creation of the album but I just cannot understand why he made them all choppy and weird. It really kills the flow of the album, IMO. 

Here's some samples of what I'm talking about in case you haven't listened to the album:

['Metropolis' outro](http://youtu.be/4bdMtenCBjc?t=4m42s)  

['Buried Alive' outro](http://youtu.be/tqJ24z5ys4U?t=5m17s)

['Bounce' outro](http://youtu.be/ENDuSctl8h4?t=3m45s)

ETC.

I really love the album, I think the beats and lyrics are awesome. I just don't get it.  </TEXT>

I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can shrek you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare ear tube antenna things. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed shrekage, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Ogre Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to shrek your miserable ass off the face of my swamp, you little long-nosed puppet. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your shreking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn trespasser. I will shrek fury all over you and you will drown in in the mud of my swamp. You're shreking shreked, kiddo.

<TEXT> I was having a discussion with a cab driver while abroad in Mexico and he flat-out asked:  

"All black people are evil, right?"  

And just turned the question on him.  

"Are all brown people evil? Are all Asians evil? No? Well that's your answer."   </TEXT>

I got a little mixed up, not 'TOS' but 'User Agreement' 

Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe this says that OP doesn't own his content once placed on reddit; reddit owns the content. 

So no, not public domain. My bad. </TEXT>

121 went down to one lane a couple of weeks ago (where it enters Garland) and there were signs for miles saying "left lane closed ahead".  

We get 500m from where the lanes merge and what do you see? A bunch of assholes getting in the left lane to cut people off at the end.  

I placed my car between my lane and the left lane to stop them and all they did was drive in the shoulder to go around to be stuck at the end.  

I don't get it.

<TEXT> My worst enemy.  

5 years ago I went into a Firehouse Subs and asked for the hottest sauce they had.  

The man handed me this sauce.  

I placed a crap load on my sandwich, ate it all up with minimal tears, and left the store.  

That's when it hit me. It felt like Bruce Lee was in my stomach trying to kick his way out.

I drove to the nearest dollar store to pick up some pepto bismol and I felt James Bond drugged (from that scene in Casino Royale) as I walked to their bathroom where I proceeded to puke.

I think it was loud on purpose. Like when Michael Cain's big reveal is practically inaudible due to the sound? Yeah, that might just be the director trying to convey how you would feel if you heard that. You hear the truth and then nothing else matters. 

Or the shuttle taking off? SHIT FLYING INTO SPACE IS LOUD... </TEXT>

<TITLE> Trouble with Arma 3 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-08 18:51:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A friend of mine gifted me Arma 3 for Christmas (I couldn't be more thankful) but I'm having some FPS troubles.  

I've followed many tutorials to increase my FPS in multiplayer but I'm still getting around 24fps.  

I've had to turn the graphics down extremely low which makes the game very ugly! It's a beautiful game! I want to experience is in its glory.  

Anyhow, I've come to the conclusion that it's my GPU (Radeon 6870) and I'm looking to purchase a new one (can be a refurbished or used one). One that can handle Arma 3 at (hopefully) max settings. I also don't want to spend a fortune. I'd like to spend at max $240.  

What types of GPUs do you all use to run it at high settings? Any ideas or paths would be greatly appreciated.   


Also: I get rekt in every firefight I encounter, I can't turn fast enough...  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Perhaps there is a difference but perhaps not. Everywhere else I've been has a much lighter panang curry, it doesn't look slow cooked from what I can tell. It's not that deep dark red. Makes me sad :(. I just purchased some panang curry paste off of amazon and I'm going to try and make your recipe when it comes in. Man, but nothing beats Madam Mam's panang curry. I could eat it every meal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have no idea where to begin. I thought taking this practice test provided [through the LSAC website](http://www.lsac.org/docs/default-source/jd-docs/sampleptjune.pdf) would be a good gauge on where I currently stand. 

So far I figured I suck at the logic games. 

I'd love to be able to score high by the December 8th test but I also know they have one in February too. Would it be better to wait until February?

I'm also not made of money and a lot of these tutoring sessions are half my monthly income. 

I've talked to a couple of friends I know who are in law school and they said that they had both taken courses. I think one did a private tutor (which cost him a shit load) and the other took a princeton review course (the lowest one being $1550 (3/4ths of my income)).

I've looked at the links provided on the sidebar and I hear the Blueprint is a decent service that's only under $900. </TEXT>

You know how it went on sale 2 days ago? Well this whole damn time I've owned the game I have just assumed I've had it. Until last night.

I play mulitplayer with some friends of mine and I try and join their game only to find out I don't actually have it and now it's $30 (a little ridiculous for a DLC if you ask me). If you have an extra copy from a bundle, i'd appreciate it.

I'll even draw something in mspaint for you if you comment (you don't have to give me the game for me to draw.) </TEXT>

I sign up and took a practice test (which paid out $10), got a 5 star rating and haven't really received a test since. I mean, you get screened for most of them (which, so far, has led me to 0 successes). 

Do you have any tips or tricks on getting new tests? I mean shit, I'd love the extra work but it is so damn picky. Should I just lie or something? I'd hate to do that. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello all, I hope I'm in the right place.  

My yard has a bad chigger problem. If any of us or our animals go out, we get eaten alive. I've been researching non-pesticidal ways to remove them from our yard and have come up with two safe tactics.

1. Nematodes
2. Sulfur  

My problem is, I'd like to rid them while spending the least amount of cash.  

Nematodes work well, I hear, but they are pretty expensive and require a special hose hookup to apply.  

Sulfur is cheap but I'm curious if it will affect my yard's ecosystem in a harmful way. I know it smells (that's not an issue for me) but would that smell keep birds away? What about bees? I'd hate to shoo bees away because of the chiggers. Would it negatively affect my dog?  

Any help would be appreciated. </TEXT>

Anyhow, I sit down to take the browns to the superb owl. I pinch a couple of loaves and realize that there is no toilet paper in my stall. Shit! 

I didn't want to walk out with my ass covered in dookie so I asked the man in the stall next to me if he could spare some squares. He shuffles real quick and hands me a wadded up tp bunch with warm liquid on it.

I smelt it (you would too) and it was totes jizz.


TL;DR. Wiped my ass with a jizz soaked TP square. </TEXT>

Are there any redditors that have had a month-to-month and does the rate change dramatically?  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> At work we have [wall-mounted lock box](http://imgur.com/UEUElTj) where we store keys. It's always been open but yesterday I bumped up against it and closed it. Now it's locked shut and nobody knows the combination.

It's not your typical [multiple-dial lock](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Combination_discs.png), I've looked up youtube guides that tell people to look for markings under the turning dials and it doesn't have that. What I do see is [THIS](http://imgur.com/m3MtVjw). There is a flat surface on the cylinder below all three of the dials. I've tried lining them up facing me with no luck, I tried using the opposite number as well with no luck. I'm not even sure if that's the way I should be going in order to open it.

I need help opening this lock. Any help would be appreciated. </TEXT>

'Hey Morty!, I saw Captain America: The Winter Soilder last night, here is some pictures of it even though you haven't seen it yet because you're following your capitalist overlords' wishes by being a slave to education and you're a good boy because of social pressures.'

H-h-how would you feel, MORTY? Would you feel angry!? *Beeeeeelllcccchhh* Yeah, that's what I thought. Think about, it Morty."



I get it, it's a karma gravy-train. But some of us have to be up for work early in the morning, have early classes, or don't have cable and have to wait for the episodes to be available online. So here we are browsing and BAM, a spoiler appears. It doesn't feel to good. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello Gracious Community!

I've recently decided to acquire a road bike and I've got some helpful tips from users on where to find a great selection of used ones under $200 (120.53 pounds, 145.36 euro). Below is a list of links of bikes that I thought looked great. Do you mind giving your two cents on which one would be the best purchase or advice on what a good deal looks like?

Here are some specs as to my body type:

I'm 5ft 8in (172.72cm)  
I weigh 195lbs (88.4505kg)


Also, if you see one that's not worth the price listed, feel free to give me an amount and I'll ask the seller! 

I very much appreciate your assistance. Thank you for the support/help! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Handle Bar Troubles </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-04-02 19:53:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello community!

I have a low-end mountain bike. I bought it used for $25. The only big issue I have with it is the handlebar keeps coming loose! I've tried tightening the bolt and ended up stripping it. I have a new bolt and it's not working to well either. Do you have any recommendations on how to keep it secure? Maybe a trick? 

Also, where is the best place to find used sports bikes? Like the majority of the ones on the front page. I really like their design, the thinner wheels, and the two-placement handlebars. They also look like they're a little lighter than mine. But they're expensive new! 

Thank you so much for your help! </TEXT>

Upvote the post for awareness and winners will be chosen tomorrow at 8pm Central Standard Time.

Do not forget to provide your Steam ID. Please refrain from requesting if you have already received something from GoG. I know how disappointing it is to submit to countless offers and come up with  nothing, so I'd like to give only the underdogs a chance. 


EDIT FOR ALL:

User /u/lumenation has informed me of this info:

**If you have Sims 3 on steam and try to buy expansions from stores or from Origin, they will not pair with the Sims 3 on steam. Only expac's bought on steam will work with Sims 3.  

However you can use the steam Sims 3 key on origin and any expec's bought on steam with origin as well.
If you knew this or not I just thought I'd let you know so you can inform others. I had issues with this when I originally had Sims 3 on my steam.**

EDIT 2: Thank you for your entries, ladies and gentlemen. /u/Manlyarmpits is the winner! Congratulations! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I went to the doctor recently to get some blood work done. They said that my TSH was running high and that my thryroid isn't producing enough of the hormone. She wants me to start taking levothyroxine. However, I'm scared. What if there is an underlying cause of this occurrence? My family does not have a history of thyroid issues and I had blood work done last year with no thyroid issues (that I know of). I'm scared that if I start taking the supplement that if it's another issue that hasn't been diagnosed and is treatable, that I will eventually become dependant on the medication and my thyroid will stop producing hormones all together. Am I making sense? What can I do? </TEXT>

They made me watch hours upon hours of reality TV (Jersey Shore, Teen Mom, and The Real Housewives of Atlanta) while crushing my ball-sack with a pair of vice grips. They inserted 2-4lb pineapples in most of my orifices and then forced me to eat the fruit. This went on for months.

That is... until Yishan saved me. He came and stopped the torment and he promised me that I would one day come to love him. 

Today is that day, my brothers. He is lov...

<TEXT> Look, I've tried donotcall.gov, I've tried being nice and telling them to please remove my number from their list. But they're adapting... Like this:

I'll get calls from numbers all over the country, when I pick up they hang up on me. I would ignore them but if I don't pick up they'll call me 4-5 times a day. Just yesterday I picked up and didn't say anything and I could hear a guy speaking Farsi. As soon as I said hello he hung up on me. If I call them back then it'll take me to a rep and when I ask them to remove me from their list they just hang up on me. 

I would love to scare the shit out of them or take legal action. It kinda freaks me out when I answer and get hung up on. Can anyone help me?  </TEXT>

**Now the problem:**    

Just recently (within the last week) I would turn my PC on and it would load to the login screen. After I entering the password it would load the desktop and after about 10 seconds my mouse would freeze, my keyboard would be unresponsive and then the video would cut out. Every now and then after doing this my PC would restart but would meet the same doom. **This is a list of the things I tried to fix it:**  


* Draining the power after the PSU is unplugged  
* Reseating the RAM  
* Reseating the GPU  
* Resetting the BIOS (by removing the little round battery)  
* [Following these directions to make sure I'm not a crazy person](http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/261145-31-perform-steps-posting-post-boot-video-problems)  

Anyhow, it's a new build (been working fine for about 4 months). </TEXT>

<TEXT> You people loved the shit out of "Let Nas Down" by J. Cole. I love that shit too. I love the shit out of it. But all be damned. I post a link to NAS' FUCKING RESPONSE and you look the other way? J COLE WAS INSPIRED BY NAS (you'd know that by listening to "Let Nas Down") because Nas is a lyrical master. When J. Cole made that first album and became a bubble gum rapper, NAS SAID "Hey man! What the fuck!? You're better than that shit dude."  

J. Cole was obviously upset that his idol criticized him so he poured his heart and soul into [Born Sinner](http://open.spotify.com/album/1NfrmcXk8xNennyxQ57JcW) and especially that one fucking song you people liked ([Let Nas Down](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLF39513uwM)).

Well guess the fuck what? Nas heard the damn song, took the beat and intro and made a fucking response out of it. JESUS CHRIST. IS THAT NOT THE MOST BADASS THING YOU'VE EVER FUCKING HEARD? I'm not going to spoil the damn song for you all. It's worth a listen. 

"But but... it's rap" -asshole 
"Shut the fuck up and open your damn mind fool" - me  

"But it's 3 minutes long." -asshole
"Are you fucking kidding me? You spend more than three minutes jerking off getting the same euphoria that this 3 minutes will bring your bitch ass." - me  

"But your words... they hurt my feelings." -asshole
"Grow the fuck up you little bitch. Life hurts. Cry a river, build a bridge, get the fuck over it and listen to the goddamn song or so help me I will find you and implant a goddamn chip into your head that loops 'Banana Phone' into your mind nonstop. The only thing that'll make it stop is you getting over your hypocritical mentality and listening to the goddamn song." - me


[LISTEN TO IT SHIT FUCK CHRIST CROSS BITCH NIGGA.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgcAPrmz4zg)  

And if you've already listened to it and are like "Dude, chill the fuck out. I loved that shit too." then good for you. Let's eat crumpets some time. 


Also, discuss your thoughts on both songs. </TEXT>

I don't mind driving a fair distance to acquire it but I just don't know where to go! I went by an Asian market in Plano, TX with no luck (I thought for sure they'd have it). Can anyone offer any suggestions? </TEXT>
