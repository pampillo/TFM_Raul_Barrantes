<TEXT> "In our constitution there are many rights: the right to housing, the right to education, the right to health. But I don't find the right to park." -  Enrique Pealosa, former mayor of Bogota, Colombia

People act like parking is some kind of right they have wherever they go, and if it isn't available there needs to be an "improvement." I, however, see removing parking as an improvement.   </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi everyone.  I have a little side business called Bling for the Ring that sells vintage stock pins and lapel pins, offering riders something unique to accessorize with.  I sell primarily in the Morgan and Saddlebred world, since those are the breeds I show with, but would love to tap into the Hunter/Jumper, Dressage, and Arab worlds.  

Does anyone know of any message boards where I could post, facebook pages I could like, or any other ways to reach out to these disciplines/breeds?  I have an Etsy page and can ship internationally, so the sky's the limit!!!  

Any help would be great.  If you're curious about what I'm selling, my Etsy page is here: https://www.etsy.com/shop/blingforthering

Thank you all in advance! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Glowie is a 30 year old Morgan mare.  She sound of body except for some arthritis you would expect at her age, but is rather senile.  She has a stall but prefers not being in it, so the door is simply left open and she comes and goes as she pleases.  She wanders around the barn, the indoor arena, and around the farm grounds.  She is slow moving and never strays too far.  She is usually found napping, watching lessons, or raiding people's bags and purses for goodies. :)  It can be a shock to new visitors to just see her strolling around on a sunny day! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cushings is a tough thing.  It's great that Lenny has made it so long though!  I think Cushings is the one drawback about Morgans -- some of them just seem to be prone to it.  When we put Baby down she still looked pretty good, but was having problems moving around and walking comfortably.  Winter was on its way, so we made the decision to put her down before she got really bad.  Definitely do pictures with Lenny this summer, you'll treasure them forever!  We also had a bronze commissioned of Baby, and that is a very special thing to me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks RonRonner!  We kept her happy and comfortable as long as we could.  She'd had IR problems since she was about 10, and I had to stop riding her about a year before we put her down at the age of only 16.  She had some problems keeping weight on, but never got too bad.  The farm and their staff is incredible, and I credit their expertise and diligent care when it comes to how long she stayed sound and happy.  She is buried on the farm, under the pasture where the new foals play. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> My horse hasn't had a lame day in his life, and my young colt has also had no issues at all thus far.  My mare, who we lost last year, did succumb to chronic laminitis.  This is probably the one "problem" Morgans have.  They are prone to laminitis, insulin resistance, and founder.  However, most Morgans I know were hale and hardy until their mid to late 20s.  They are indeed tough, while having beautiful refinement.  

As for ants in their pants -- I can really come down to breeding and training.  My horse can be rather fire-breathing, in the respect that he always wants to go as fast as possible!  I never really ask him to go forward, just to slow down.  When we do our extensions, I simply stop trying to slow his body and off we go!  So many Morgans I've ridden are like this -- go go GO!  But they do have great brains as well.  My gelding is often TOO smart for his own good.  He even has a full understanding of the music they play at our shows, and will try to transition into the next gait when he hears the key of the music change!

Well, when you rebuild your wallet, and if you want to look into a Morgan, you know where to find me on Reddit!  Depending on what part of the country you're in, there could be some really great opportunities.  Have you ever considered taking lessons at a Morgan barn just to try out their dressage abilities? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Morgans are great little dressage horses!  I have several friends who use their horses for dressage, and now Western dressage is becoming really popular as well.  If you want any Morgan dressage connections, PM me and I can get you in touch with the right folks.

Even though my horse competes in hunter pleasure, we do a lot of basic dressage exercises with him at home, especially now that we're trying to get him better with patterns.  He overthinks everything and jumps to conclusions!  The dressage work is slowing his brain down a bit. :)  Here's a pic of him doing his thing in the show ring because, well, who doesn't love more horse pictures? :)

<TEXT> Well, I'm not sure if this will clarify much (as reins just tend to look like a tangle), but here is my horse wearing the aforementioned rein configuration.  The bit he's wearing in this picture isn't the same one we're discussing here, but the reins are run in the same way.  Snaffle rein goes directly from hand to bit, and is clipped to the ring of the bit.  Curb rein goes from saddle, through bit ring, and doubles back.

Hope that clears things up a little!

<TEXT> Ladies and gents, my good friend finds herself without a job after this holiday season, and is having problems finding something new due to an odd looking resume.  In short -- after some medical issues took her out of the workplace for several years, she decided to become a horse trainer, which she did for several more years, until now.  Basically, she has an odd blank spot in her resume that employers don't like, and even after applying to 65+ jobs, has nothing to show for it.  

Preferences include some kind of receptionist/administrative assistant job, something in a law office, etc.  Really though, retail, sales, or whatever would work at this point.  Part time would be ok.  Things are going to get tough for her if she doesn't find anything soon and I don't know how else to help her than put the word out on here.

I can send a resume to anyone who is interested, or thinks their employer might be hiring.  She is smart and easy to like, and also hysterically funny.  If I could offer her a job I would, but I'm just not in that position right now.

Thanks Reddit, you're the best. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not sure on the footing, but usually it's a mixture of tanbark and sand and dirt.  The green color is traditional for this show and is made from dying woodchips.  

So since this class is all about speed (while maintaining a correct frame) it's a combination of pushing your horse forward while bringing him back a bit to get him to collect.  For most of these ponies, they want to GO GO GO!  When I have shown them, you don't cluck much to move them on, you just stop telling them to slow down!  And you have to slow down in those tight corners as well, and lean into them so you don't flip the cart.  So yes, you can hear the driver's voice telling the pony to slow down, and then as they call for faster and faster speeds, she says less and just lets him fly! 

Conformation and manners also plays into the judging, as well as head carriage and correct motion of the gait.  I'd love to show one again -- so fun! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow, quick response, and a good answer!  I had no idea so much went into it, though I'm not surprised it's so complex.  I am not a natural redhead, but I have heard about things related to redheads and anesthesia.  At the time I had both surgeries, I wasn't on any medications at all.  Though it is interesting that you mention Klonopin, because I've been taking that for the past couple years now.  If I need to go under again and am still on the Klonopin, maybe I'll be easier to handle. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> How do you determine how much anesthesia to give a patient?  I've been put under twice, and they've commented both times about how hard I was to "knock out".  As in, I think they had to give me more anesthesia than they thought.  Does it have to do with a person's age?  Size?  I'm 27, female, and 120 lbs at 5'3".

Just wondering why I've been compared to "trying to take down a rhino."  Lol. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Holy crap Dan, that was a fast reply!  I may indeed be up for dinner with your and your ladyfriend.  I'll be living in what I think is Near East (right by Olbrich).  I'm a very social person and like having a large group of friends that enjoy doing things on a fairly regular basis.  Generally, I'm up for most things.  Going out, staying in, having potlucks/grilling out, going to museums/concerts/.  

I bit about me, I suppose.  I'm a 27 year old female currently living in Minneapolis and finishing my Master's thesis in Landscape Architecture.  The job at Olbrich is just a stop-gap internship while I find work in a design firm.  That job may be in Madison (if I fall in love with the place and there is work), or I may be moving in the fall to one of the coasts in hopes of getting a job out there.  I will also be continuing my job for the University of Minnesota as the copyeditor of the Landscape Journal, which will keep me a bit busy, at least for the summer.

I really appreciate you writing back so quickly!  The next few weeks are going to be tough as I uproot myself from the safety of graduate school and the friends I have made over the last 9 years of living in Minneapolis.  However, as we all know, change is necessary, and I sincerely hope the best is yet to come in my life!

I'll be in touch,
    Nicole   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Greetings Madison!

I'll be moving to your fine city in about a month.  This marks my terrifying transition from graduate school up here in Minneapolis to the "real world", where people are married, have babies, and don't have time for new friends.  I know a few folks in Madison, but they are all married, or insanely busy, or both.  No babies though...yet.

WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?  Where should I go to meet up with some lovely, intelligent folks?  I see you have some bar meetups, and I plan on hanging out at coffeeshops, concerts, and the like, but how do you really meet people?  I'll be working at an internship at Olbrich Gardens, but as I'm the oldest intern by quite a few years, I don't think I'll be making many friends there with whom I would like to spend time outside of work.  

Anyways, let me know if you have some ideas.  PM me if you'd like to introduce yourself!  I'd love to get to know a few folks before I move, as this transition is proving to be particularly anxiety producing.  However, let it be known, I'm just coming out of a relationship and won't be looking for a "romantic connection" right off the bat.

See you all in a month! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello fellow gardeners!  My boyfriend and I have a Minnesota garden, so while you're probably a bit colder than us, things are similar.  

1) This article is short and has a nice graphic showing which things to rotate from year to year, and how to make a rotational schedule.  As for things to plant next to each other, we don't have a ton of space, so we do things like grow beans up our sunflowers, and grow lettuce under our bean trellis.  We stage a lot of things such that by the time the larger plant leafs out and shades the smaller, earlier growing plan, the smaller plant is done producing.  As for things to plant, Charentais melons were small, and FANTASTICALLY tasty (seeds can be hard to find, but PM me and could mail you some we saved), and we had an amazing crop of tomatillos last year, which is great if you want to make a green salsa.  Another fun one that I haven't personally tried, but is good for our climate is the arctic kiwi.

2) We start tomatoes, peppers, zucchini, basil, and some greens indoors, though we start the greens indoors so we can have lettuce and kale early.  We also start another round of greens outdoors.  As for timing, SproutRobot is a nice tool.  You simply enter your zip code and it makes up a schedule for you, and can even send you email reminders and ship you seed, if you so choose.  http://sproutrobot.com/

3) We have gotten all our seeds from Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds and Seed Savers Exchange.  Now we don't buy seeds unless we want to try something new, because we have gotten good at seed saving, and our stock gives us more than enough seed.

4) We have raspberries that were in the yard when we bought the house.  Again, see the arctic kiwi.  As for fruit trees, you could graft some or buy some, but you're looking at about 5 years for them to start producing, so if you plan on moving, you may want to just wait.  Also, while it isn't really a "fruit" per se, we do a lot with rhubarb.

5)  Straw for mulch can be good, but we tried it one year and it seeded everywhere, which was super annoying.  We collect leaves from parts of our yard (and mulch the rest into the grass) and dump it all over the garden in fall.  Then in spring, we turn the leaves into the soil.  We also empty two compost bins full into the garden each year.  Our soil is very sandy, so we are working hard to get organic matter into the soil, and I'm not a soil amendment expert yet.  As for mulching to control weeds, when you mow your lawn, collect some of the clippings and use them as mulch in the garden.  We've had good luck with that.

6) If you have (or can find) an old window, it's easy to build a cold frame, and that can extend your season on either end by a few weeks.  Habitat for Humanity has ReStores where you can buy used and salvaged construction materials, and that might be a good place to look.  If you're looking for a good book that covers a lot of this stuff, The Backyard Homestead is fantastic.  

Hope this helps!!!  PM me if you need melon seeds! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think a TC book club is wonderful!  I can't guarantee I'll be very available until May (I'm in the middle of my master's thesis), but I'm very interested in being involved.  I could plan meetings and find locations too.

I drive a lot, so I mostly listen to audiobooks these days.  Any books I sit down and read are for my thesis.  I work my way though a lot of young adult fiction, mostly because it's easy to follow while driving around the city.  I'm just working my way through N.D. Wilson's 100 Cupboards trilogy.  As far as adult fiction, I was an undergraduate English lit major, so I have a solid handle on that too. :)

I'll join this sub so I can stay connected.  I'd love to be a part of it.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I show in the Morgan circuit.  I started with Morgans as a kid, when I became interested in horses and a girl at school invited me over to her house to meet her horses, which were all Morgans.  From there, her mother directed my family to a nearby Morgan farm that gave lessons.  15 years later I'm still at the same barn!  I've also shown Saddlebred and Hackneys, but Morgans will always be my first love.  

It's hard to explain why I love Morgans so much more, but I feel like they have a certain spark to them.  So many of them have undeniable heart, and HUGE motors!  With both of my horses, you only have to say "whoa", never "go"!  They bring 110% to every ride.  Also, Morgans are smart -- sometimes too smart!  And of course they are beautiful!  As long as you don't need a big horse, they are the total package.   </TEXT>

I would love to get to know them, and their horses, and see if they ever need help around their small barn when they are out of town, etc. What is the best way to go about introducing yourself? I don't want to just show up on their property -- that might be seen as trespassing. What do you suggest? Have you had people approach you on your land about your horses? How did they do it? And how did it make you feel?  I board my horses, so I don't have a good feel for what its like when someone approaches you about your horses on your own land. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me it all began when a new girl came to my school in 4th grade.  She and I hit it off and she invited me to her horse show that weekend to meet her horse and watch her ride.  I'd never been to a horse show before, and was only familiar with western and jumping when it came to riding, but she had a Saddlebred and showed saddleseat, and I was instantly in love.  The following year, another girl joined our class who rode huntseat and had Morgans.  I really fell in love with her Morgan, and when I figured out that Morgans could do saddleseat, I pursued it.  My parents contacted a local trainer, and I'm still with him and his team of trainers 15 years later.  

I got my first horse when I was 14 and showed her as a saddleseat horse, but it turned out she wasn't really built for saddleseat and didn't enjoy it.  Not wanting to push her, we retired and bred her.  After she had her foal (my current show horse) we put her back to work and discovered she made a gorgeous hunter pleasure horse, so back to the show ring we went!  After a few years she retired for good and her son stepped up as my show partner.

In short, I've ridden and shown saddleseat, huntseat, and done driving with Morgans, Saddlebreds, and Hackney ponies for the past 15 years, and dabbled in bits of Dressage and Western.  At some point I would like to learn to jump!  Pictures here of my early saddleseat days (http://i.imgur.com/TQgw8.jpg), my mare as a hunter (http://i.imgur.com/jFVcm.jpg), her son as my current hunter (http://i.imgur.com/TVTI0.jpg) and one of the Hackneys I have shown in harness (http://i.imgur.com/Bl7yc.jpg)  Enjoy! </TEXT>

My mom and I were hanging out in there and talking about when our friends were riding later in the day, so she pulled the horse show schedule out of her purse and started to look over it.  He came over and stuck his face right in it and was like, "what is that!?!?!?!".  She laughed and she started "showing" him which competitions our friends were in and when they would happen.  Usually he is very busy and squirms all over, but he just stood there staring and listening and wanted her to talk more.  Really, he loves attention, so he likes lots of things: stories, toys, going for walks, neck scratches, etc.  He just likes to be with people. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mr. Tastee was my favorite, and am still, to this day, fascinated by the mystery man in the swirly head.  Even my username is inspired by him!  Was the guy that played Tastee also in other roles on the show?  Or did he only play that one character?  I've always wondered what he looked like, but I'm not sure if seeing the face of Tastee would make my childhood or ruin it.  

Also, do you know why season three of Pete and Pete never got released on DVD?  Where seasons 1 and 2 not selling as well as they had hoped?  Seems like there are a lot of Redditors...errr...people who would rush out to buy season 3.

<TEXT> I work with Morgans.  As for tapping the back legs, we don't ask them to move the back legs, simply move the front ones and stretch out their back legs.  If you mare moves her front legs forward, and the centers the weight of her body on her front legs, her back legs will stretch out.  I don't think Morgans park out differently than TWHs, do they?  Here is a parked out Morgan:http://randstables.com/files/2012/02/BoogieNE.jpg

You can see that he is putting most of his weight on his front legs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The way my trainers have done it in the past is through patience and repetition.  First you have to teach her how to do it in hand, and then you can move up to doing it under saddle (for the line-up).  Halter your mare and take her out.  You could even do it in cross ties if you want, to make your life easier.  Take a whip, or even the handle of a broom, and gently tap on the back of one of her front legs, saying "down".  "Down" will be your command for parking out.  Then when she moves her foot, lots of praise!!!  Now do the other one, saying "down".  More praise!!!!!!!  Carrots!!!!!  Sometimes horses have problems lining their feet up straight when they are learning to park out.  I've seen my trainers grab the top of the horse's withers and rock them back and forth, to unbalance the horse just a bit and get them to square up their feet.  

Once she does it on the ground with you saying "down", and maybe just tapping a tiny bit or not at all, try it under saddle.  Find a long whip and pretend like you are in the lineup at a show.  Tell her "down", and lean over to tap her legs with the whip.  She'll probably put two and two together after a few tries.  In a show, you won't want to tap her legs with the whip, but you can tap her on the shoulder and tell her "down", and that is a refinement of the command.  Most of our horses park out when they are told "down", and many of them park out automatically when they come into the middle of the ring to stand.  

I hope this makes sense and I hope it helps!  It should be a fun exercise for you and your mare -- you get to learn together!  Good luck, and let me know if you have any more questions.

<TEXT> Classes at breed shows get big and it's often important to stand out.  The judge may love your horse, but if your horse doesn't have distinctive markings you may get lots in a sea of navy hunt coats!  I show my Morgan in the Hunter Pleasure division, and have one light green coat and one tan/gold coat.  I wear them with dark shirts, and wear the tan coat with dark brown breeches.  I also wear a conservative belt, and sparkly stock pins and number pins.  Some bling is totally ok!  It would look crazy in the H/J circuit, but at a breed show it's very typical.  For reference, here are a few photos to give you an idea:

Tan coat on my gelding: http://i.imgur.com/mDkbs.jpg
Green coat on my mare: http://i.imgur.com/DwQf9.jpg
Green coat on my gelding (a bit washed out by the flash): http://i.imgur.com/fs8Fh.jpg

Hope this helps, and may you have blue ribbon rides!

<TEXT> Haha, the saddle *does* have some shape to it.  It's not like my saddleseat saddle!  Here is a picture of a Wotan, though I feel like mine may be a bit more shallow.  It's a great saddle if you're looking for an all-purpose close contact type.  http://www.countrytack.com/used_saddles/wotan_left.JPG </TEXT>

<TEXT> I personally have a Stubben Wotan I bought off ebay.  It was only $350, and in amazing condition.  Not sure what you like as far as cushion/support, but I love the Wotan because there is no padding on the seat or knee roll areas, and the knee roll is very small.  Also, the saddle is fairly flat, which fits my horse well and is what I like to ride in, but won't work if your horse has high withers.  

Maybe you like a squishy saddle...if you do, the Wotan is NOT for you, but I do love mine!   :)  Also, I use it for riding at home and showing, and it is a great all around saddle.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> OHHHHHH He's a Saddlebred!  No wonder I love him so much, I've been riding Saddlebreds for years.  Now that I look at him again, I can see it in his face.  Well, I'll think of some names!

And yes, it does look like he would have flunked out of "Saddlebred School" due to his movement, but what so many people don't realize is that Saddlebreds make great dressage, endurance, eventing, jumping, trail, EVERYTHING horses.  They may be the peacocks of the show ring, but they should be recognized as the peacocks of MANY show rings!  And he certainly won't have trouble flexing and putting his head in a nice spot for dressage.  I'm glad he found a home with you, he's going to have so much fun learning dressage! </TEXT>

<TEXT> We use Markell Insurance for both our horses.  Check it out at http://www.markelinsurance.com/Products/Farm/Pages/PrivateHorseOwnerLiability.aspx

I couldn't tell you off the top of my head what we pay for the insurance, but I know it varies depending on how much coverage you need, i.e. what your horse is "worth".  That depends on show record, age, etc.   They have good medical coverage, but now my mare has issues being covered on ANY equine insurance because of laminitis issues.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not in Hyde Park, but when I was in London I went riding at Wimbledon Village Stables.  My mom and I both rode and had a great experience.  They are proximate to a huge and beautiful park, with lots of wooded paths for hacking.  We got to canter through the forest on some nicely trained horses.  Also, it wasn't anywhere near $150.  We had a guide, and it was just the three of us (the guide, my mom, and I).  So we rode very much for our experience level.  Check them out!  If you can't find anything for Hyde Park, try them instead.  They are a short (20 min) train ride from London.  http://www.wvstables.com/ </TEXT>

You can buy it crazy cheap on Amazon.  http://www.amazon.com/Horse-Danny-Leelee-Sobieski/dp/B000A1IL8M/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1330539605 sr=8-1  It is my favorite horse movie!  As a child, I was obsessed -- I think I wore out the copy they had at the video store, and my mom finally got me my own VHS of it. 

As far as books, Walter Farley's "Man O' War" is great, even as I grow older, and there is a biography of Cigar called "Cigar: America's Horse" that is very well done.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you can't ride, could you drive?  I'm not sure if either of your horses know how to drive, and I wouldn't suggest trying to train them to do it yourself, but if a knowledgeable person can start them in harness locally, I'd bet they'd take to it quickly.  Driving can really help with your riding too, since you have to communicate through your hands and voice, and it gives you a great "feel" for a horse's mouth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since it sounds like the saddle will be used on lots of different horses, you may want to wait on buying saddle and instead get some other accessories for her.  The first thing I got when I was a kid were a set of my own stirrups (so I didn't always have to adjust when I rode), and then when I got my first horse I got a saddle.  Boots, riding pants, a new helmet, a grooming kit, etc. may be better ideas for now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My trainer always likes to say that your toes should be behind the girth, no matter what gait you are performing, though the ear/hip/heel rule is a bit different for Saddleseat, since it is acceptable to have your lower leg farther forward.  This is especially true when riding a Saddlebred at the slowgait or rack, since it is often helpful to push your feet forward a bit (though it depends on the horse). 

Some of the best info I can give you are photos.  Here are pictures of this year's Senior Saddleseat Equitation World Champion.  The first picture is her "down" in her post, the rest are her "up" in her post.  Now, this is an equitation rider, so she is being judged solely on her position and control of the horse.  When I ride, my equitation isn't bad, but my legs aren't so far under me.  Sorry for the long urls.

Here is a picture of my "equitation" (these are old pictures from when I was a teenager).

Down in my post (my heels could be more down) http://i.imgur.com/P3nbi.jpg

Up in my post http://i.imgur.com/3p2Gu.jpg (again, more weight should be in my heels)

Hope this helps a bit!  Above all, don't ride like this!!!  http://www.uphaonline.com/images/2010%20awards/lamborghini-in-black.jpg (phenomenal horse, but terrible leg position!)

And to answer your question, I show Morgans.

What do you mean when you say that Arabs are one of the more natural breeds?  Do you mean for saddleseat?  Because my view was always that the Arabs were the most unnatural saddleseat horses, simply because their motion (historically) was to move with lower action and a sweeping stride to cross desert sands efficiently, not to step high and raise the knees.  I know that they are now breeding for the bend at the knee, but I don't know how true it is to the breed's origins.  Your opinions? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, the equitation is completely different - so comparing a saddleseat rider to a hunter/jumper rider is like comparing apples and oranges.  To effectively ride our horses we need to sit back, legs away from our horse's sides, hands elevated.  Saddleseat equitation should look like this: http://www.discoverhorses.com/saddle-seat-equitation.html  Of course, there are people out there that ride like this (ick):http://www.uphaonline.com/images/charming.jpg

If course, the same goes for any discipline. I founded and formed an equestrian team at my college and was the only non-jumper person.  I was SHOCKED at the lack of ability in most of the riders.  So many of them were pushed to jump before they really had developed a seat.  I think this is why jumping is seen as "dangerous", simply because people haven't really learned how to "sit" yet.

And yes, I've done LOTs of cross-training.  My mare transitioned to huntseat years ago, so for the past several years I've been riding both Saddleseat and Huntseat, and I've had to develop two different forms of equitation depending on which horse I'm riding.  I've also done hunter/jumper stuff in college, some dressage, and LOTS of driving.  I think everyone should take a "vacation" from their discipline and try something else for a few months!  It's so helpful.  

You can judge my equitation for yourself if you like, I'm by no means an "equitation rider" and was never trained as one, but this is how I sit when I ride huntseat.  http://i.imgur.com/jFVcm.jpg </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't follow you captainstag.  What about horses that wear Easyboots?  Do you think that horses shouldn't wear shoes at all?  Show horses' longer feet and weighted shoes cause no ill effects.  Many show horses compete into their 20's and are completely sound.  I wish I had a picture of my horse's feet -- they're really not that much longer than your average horse.

I do think that the TWHs stress out their horse's joints in the "big lick" division.  Those shoes are huge, heavy, and throw the entire stance of the horse off.  AND they ride two year olds that way!  Those horses are too often crippled before they hit 10.  So sad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey FlameGirl!  I'll go through these one by one:

1) You can do some things to encourage head and neck position, but most of all the horse has to be built for it.  My horse is not, that is is why he because a hunter and not a saddleseat-type horse.  However, assuming the horse is upheaded to begin with, the upheadedness and head carriage come from a) building muscle and b) collection.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Dumb jockeys are used, taking the place of a rider when a horse isn't being ridden.  They help teach a horse the proper "frame" to be in.  When we ride, our hands are elevated to meet the elevation of our horse's head and neck.  While riding, you can bump and tickle your snaffle bit to ask the horse to keep his head up.  Of course, none of this is possible without good impulsion from the hind end.  When a horse pushes off its hind end, it elevates its front end.  There are plenty of horse that go around the ring with their head down because they are not collected and pushing off the hind!  

2) I don't know much about rollkur.  I've never seen it used outside of dressage. :/

3) The rider sitting farther back on the horse does not have any ill effects on the horse's back.  Morgans, Saddlebreds, etc. have a center of gravity that is in the middle of their back (they are built in an upright fashion) as opposed to a thoroughbred or quarter horse whose center of gravity is over the shoulders.  The saddles are designed to sit in the middle of the horse's back and the flaps are cut back to free up the horse's shoulders and not impede their movement.

4) Whips are used pretty much like they are in any other discipline I suppose.  Lots of riders show without whips.  I rarely use them, even at home when training.  Sometimes they are carried as a "prop", especially in equitation classes, and I carry one in the ring sometimes because my horse tends to focus and listen better if I'm holding it.  Otherwise, it's just an aid, as it is with anything else.

5)  Many Saddlebreds and Hackneys have had their tail "set".  In other words, a muscle in the underside of the tail has been cut to allow the tail to stretch up and bend over at the top.  Some people think that the tail bone is broken, which is not the case (and would be awful!).  My horse is a Morgan, so this type of procedure is illegal for our breed.  He does, however, wear a bustle in his stall to encourage an "arched" tail carriage.  Desired Morgan tail carriage looks like this: http://www.playmorfarm.com/Play_mor_farms_stallions/stallion_images/centerpiece-thumb-2010-2.jpg  Desired Saddlebred tail carriage looks like this: http://www.goinggaited.com/Born_Contender_al_12-4-06.jpg

<TEXT> The topics that always come up with "abuse" in the saddleseat world generally has to do with several things: shoeing, soring, and training aids.

1) Saddleseat horses wear weighted shoes, and their hooves are grown out longer than, say, a thoroughbred's hooves.  Many people see this as strange because their horses don't have feet like this, and thing that a) the shoes are heavy and hurt the horse and that b) the hooves lose the proper angle when they are grown out and it is detrimental to the horse's legs.  The shoes are, in actuality, quite light.  We have to realize that we're dealing with a 1000 lb animal, and the shoes weigh a matter of ounces.  Also, when the hooves are grown out longer, proper angles HAVE to be maintained for the horse to be sound and happy, so it's actually very important to keep the angles correct.  Of course there are crappy farriers out there, but that can happen to any horse of any breed/discipline.  It is also important to point out that hoof length and shoe length are strictly regulated -- every time I leave the ring after a class there is a steward there measuring my horse's hooves, making sure we are within the regulations. 

2) People often think that Saddlebreds, Morgans, National Show Horses, etc. are "sored" in the fashion that some Tennessee Walking Horses are.  In the TWH world, some trainers (not all) apply chemicals to the legs of the horses that burn or cause pain, causing the horse to lift its legs high to try and get away from the sensation.  It's abusive, but it does work, and the reason it works for TWHs is that they are gaited (meaning they perform a running walk) and do not perform a trot.  A sored horse will look lame at the trot (because they are).  Therefore, soring for trotting breeds is irrational.  Even a Saddlebred that can perform the two extra "gaited horse" gaits (the slow-gait and rack) still have to trot in the show ring, and a sored horse would stick out like, well, a sore thumb.  I do not condone what is done to the Walking Horses, and will never be about to understand how the owners and riders of these horses can put their horses through this and still say they love them.  

3) Training aids used in the saddleseat world are things like stretchies and chains.  Stretchies are simply a length of rubber surgical tubing that is connected between the horses front legs to provide resistance.  They look like this: http://i.imgur.com/vpc0W.jpg.  Have you done this at the gym? http://www.health.com/health/static/hw/media/medical/hw/h9991377_001_02.jpg  It works the same way, building up the chest and shoulder muscles of the horse -- this can create a higher step through improving muscle tone.  Some horses, like my horse, don't use them -- they take short steps to avoid them, basically looking at me and saying "yeah...whatever". :)  As for chains, they are places like bracelets around the horse's ankles, and again, encourage a higher step.  The combination of a bit of weight (think ankle weights) plus the looseness of the chain (the chain flings forward when the horse trots, and carries the foot a bit with it, creating a higher, more open step).  Here is a picture of a horse trotting wearing chains.  You can see how the chain is flinging forward on her hind leg http://morganshowcase.com/Listing.php?HorseName=Wonderful%20Tonight Page=Photo Order=4.  Some folks think that these chains are exceptionally heavy, but really, they're just chains.  Perhaps like one you'd lock up your bike with.  Kids put them on their feet at horse shows and pretend to be "show horses" all the time.  There is also the misconception that the chains bang onto the horses feet causing as "soring" effect.  Again, soring a trotting horse doesn't work, and moreover this is not an effect of using chains.  Some chains come coated, padded, or are wrapped to prevent any sort of injury from occurring, and many horses get worked with their legs wrapped and boots on.  An added bonus of riding a horse wearing chains is that they jingle, and it's a good exercise for riders to listen to the rhythm of the chains to determine their horse's stride, cadence, and speed.

Wowzers, that got long!  Thanks for your questions CaptainCorpsie! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello fellow Reddit equestrians!  I have been constantly seeing forum after forum of people blogging, posting, and ranting about "show horse abuse" in all disciplines, and one that always arises are the Saddleseat horses.  I read the comments, I look at the examples, and generally people who make negative comments are doing so because they're not sure what the discipline is all about, and don't understand the training, riding, and showing of these horses.  

Also, many people don't know what Saddleseat is at all, which is understandable since it's sort of a small world compared to the western and hunter circuits.

So here I am, a saddleseat rider putting myself out there.  AMA!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some people with HMS can certainly still run, it's just not one of the things I'm able to do.  I wouldn't rush into the doctor, but next time you go in for a check up you might want to mention it.  They may look at you right there, or if you like, you could have them refer you to a rhumatologist (that's who diagnosed me).  

The back pain may be unrelated, as many people have back pain, but the sprains and dislocations could be a sign of HMS.  Have you ever broken a bone?  I tend to sprain/dislocate in situations where other people may break (falling off horses, having a horse fall on top of me, etc.).  I wonder if you are the same.

Also, it's AWESOME that you compete in marathons -- something I would love to be able to do! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Those are definitely the two camps that people split into!  Typically, people who are into medicine are in the "ooooOOOOOoooo" camp and most other people are in the "OH GOD MAKE IT STOP" camp.  My boyfriend is used to it, but I think it still freaks him out on occasion -- especially the hands.

I don't demonstrate very often, and I do think there is something to be said for the theory that demonstrating makes things go bad faster.  You keep stretching and stretching every time you do it, so at the very least, you're not making things any better.  But yeah, I do it in my sleep, and there are also things I do that I figured were normal, and apparently aren't.  I scared the crap out of a yoga instructor once. :)

As for the running vs. biking, for me it's definitely not an issue of fitness.  I work out and my recovery time is amazing, but once I start to run, all kinds of shit starts to go down.  Basically, when I run and my body is subjected to the impact of the running motion, my legs can't hold themselves together.  So then my muscles try to compensate for the loose joints and overtax *themselves* and then my heart begins to work overtime trying to get blood and oxygen to the muscles.  My doctor told me to not take up regular running, as it may overtax my heart.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One other idea is to go the the Red Stag Supperclub on Tuesdays, which is their "Cheap Date Night".  Two entrees, a bottle of wine, and two desserts for $32, and the atmosphere is wonderful.  A nicer place where you could dress up a bit and make an occasion out of it.  Call ahead for reservations though, the deal is very popular! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I went into the doctor thinking I had juvenile arthritis.  When she found no sign of that, she started putting me through flexibility tests and basically tied me into a knot on her exam table.  She got it right on the nose that it was HMS, but other doctors thought it was just "growing pains" even though I hadn't grown in years, or didn't have an explanation.  Not many docs I've meant know about it, and so I educate every medical student I run into about HMS!  I sat next to one on the plane and we started talking about it -- he had just studied it in class and was fascinated that he was sitting next to a living embodiment of his textbook!   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for pointing out that this is serious, dizzysparrow.  While it is entertaining, there is quite a bit of pain associated with it.  I partially dislocate things all the time -- they often pop back in on their own shortly after, but that doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.   I've also sprained my left ankle 18 times, usually just by walking down the sidewalk, and my right 13 times.  This to me is "normal".  

As for how it effects my daily life, it depends.  I cannot hold a pen for very long, so I take all notes on my laptop when I'm in classes.  Winter is the hardest -- my hands and legs stiffen up and I have problems holding onto things and moving my fingers.  I was in a drawing class this winter where I had to hold a pen for hours.  I would have to come home at night and use hot packs on my hands to ease the pain.  Of course there is the obvious -- I can't run, so fun co-ed sports are out (mostly) and I have to invest in a gym membership to stay fit since I can't just go running (though I do bike in the summer).  I believe that the worst thing about HMS is that people can't tell you have it, and therefore can't understand why you hurt or think you are "whiny".  If you looked at me walking down the street, I look no different than most people aside from a slight limp I sometimes have.  You cannot always see pain. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My pain did not subside when I finished growing that I can remember, but my pain also got worse when I was 13 or 14.  I stopped growing when I was 11, so I hadn't even hit puberty yet.  I'm really not sure how your son will be effected, but my doctor believes that as my body naturally tightens up with age (the way normal people become "stiff" with old age), I will simply become more normal and the pain will subside.  

It's interesting to hear about your son's hamstrings.  Mine are also incredibly tight -- I can't even touch my toes despite being so flexible, but I've never had any physical therapy done to loosen them up, or heard of any positive reason to do so, but I sure hope it is helping your son.  As for things like sports, let your son play!  I'm not sure where you stand on this, but don' let his EDS hold him back.  I was a three sport athlete in high school (before I was told to stop running) and had no ill effects.  I am currently an internationally competing equestrian, and I can tell you that horseback riding is great exercise for EDS kids.  Balance, muscle tone, and cardio all without the impact of running.  It is something I can do with few problems.

Tell your son to hang in there and use ice/hot packs when the going gets tough.  If you have any other coping questions let me know! </TEXT>

Me bending my fingers backward (no this does not hurt) http://i.imgur.com/51PjQ.jpg

My fingers bending by themselves (without me pushing them back).  I can hold a tennis ball this way!  http://i.imgur.com/y5sc6.jpg

<TEXT> From your description it sounds like she may, though I have no business diagnosing people.  Does she have chronic pain?  Aches in her joints and muscles?  It is possible to have hypermobility without the pain -- my mom has it as well (it is genetic) but can run and do things I can't do.  My 63-year old mom can outrun me!  

Of course, if she does gymnastics, yoga, pilates, or other "stretching" forms of exercise, it could simply be from that.  You can "become" a bit hypermobile through certain exercises. </TEXT>

On a more serious note though, there can be complications with pregnancy, and this condition is genetic, so he and I both have some concerns about having kids, if we ever choose to.  I can't say I would want my future children to go what I've been through.    </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have always been a bendy individual, but chronic pain in high school
sent me to the rheumatologist to figure out what was going on with my
body. Turns out I have hypermobility syndrome, sometimes called benign joint hypermobility syndrome (BJHS) and, more recently, believed to be the same as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_joint_hypermobility_syndrome#Hypermobility_syndrome.

I also have visual snow (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_snow)
but I'm not sure if there is any correlation between the two, since
little research on visual snow has been done.

I sprain all the time, I type like a freak (according to my
boyfriend), I sleep in positions that look like I've been in a
horrible accident, and I can't run (my legs can't handle it), but I do
live an active and joyful life despite my rebellious body! AMA!

<TEXT> I second what amaltheas2 has said.  As another horse owner/rider/competitor of many years, stick to riding lessons, and lease a horse before you buy.  If you are going to eventually buy a horse for your children, make sure you have a professional trainer you know and trust try out the horse for you, and also have your kids try out the horse to make sure it is suitable for them and their riding abilities.  Also, even if your kids are small DO NOT buy them a pony.  Ponies are smart, quick, and sometimes rather mean.  Even though they seem more intimidating because they are larger, get an older horse for your children instead.  It may be a longer way to fall off, but they will most likely fall off much less often.  Be safe and good luck! </TEXT>

<DATE> 2011-07-18 23:00:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The dog in question is Apollo, a springer spaniel/golden retriever mix. I often sing to him about his greatness, his beauty, and his strength, but I'm no songwriter, and I think he deserves an anthem of sorts. I know that a song about Apollo would make my boyfriend incredibly happy, so this is a surprise of sorts for him!

First off, here are some photos of Apollo for inspiration: http://pineappleblurt.imgur.com/apollo#38wmp

Now, some Apollo facts:

- I often sing of how he crunches the bones of his enemies, and that he is the destroyer of Tirmok, and had pillaged and burned many villages and thatched roofed cottages.

- Apollo loves the water. He also loves tennis balls, bones, eating, and his eternal love -- our neighbor Deb.

- According to Apollo, no one ever feeds him. Dinner time for him is all the time.

- He was named not for the god Apollo, but for Apollo from Battlestar Galactica.

- He has a superhero alter ego named DarkFart, who fights crime under the cover of darkness.

This doesn't have to be an original melody. Something epic sounding, like the Soviet national anthem, would be incredible. Silly lyrics, about Apollo's unrivaled awesomeness, strength, and beauty, are a must. :D

Forward songwriters! I hope someone accepts my challenge! If I end up with an mp3 of a song all about Apollo, I'll be the happiest girl alive.

<TEXT> I'll be heading down this week to Lexington for a show at the Horse Park.  It's my first time there, and there is so much to see!  I know I won't have lots of time in between showing my horse, so for those of you who have been there, what were your favorite things?  What should I skip?   I'm for sure checking out the Saddlebred museum, and I'd like to see some of the famous horses there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also related, you can kill all the nasties on a sponge by zapping it in the microwave for 2 minutes.  Careful -- resulting sponge will be hot and steamy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Merrils are awesome!  Another way to take care of your feet while still being frugal is to get a pair of prescription orthodics crafted by a podiatrist.  While the initial investment is pricey ($200?) they last for-freakin-ever (they are made of a material called Superglass, a type of fiberglass).  I got some 10 years ago because I have extremely high arches and it was killing my knees to walk.  Now they go in all the shoes I wear (except heels) and it really don't matter if I buy cheaper shoes that have no arch support (like Converse) because my orthodics are in there.  Any shoes I want, and no knee pain! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Shoes.  Buy good shoes.  If you buy crappy shoes you will mess up your feet over time and when you mess up your feet, you mess up the rest of you (knees, hips, back, etc.)  

I buy all my clothes secondhand, but always purchase top quality shoes! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Enchilada bake is the best freakin' thing ever.  Get an 8x8 pan and open a can of enchilada sauce.  Put a little bit of sauce in the bottom so things don't stick, and begin layering -- tortilla, black beans, cheese, sauce, tortilla, beans, cheese sauce, etc. until you get to the top of the pan (usually about 3 layers).  Then top it off with any leftover sauce and cheese and throw it in the oven.  350 for...I don't know...25 minutes?  You know, until it's bubbly and hot-looking and done.  

Hella tasty, impossible to mess up, cheap to make, and great for lunches. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am also building credit, and I only use my card for groceries.  Even if I don't put much on it, I'm paying it off in full each month, and therefore build credit.  I have a Chase Sapphire card along with a Chase rewards debit card (I bank with them, but they have credit cards available in general).  Also, the US Bank Flex Perk cards are very highly ranked. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had one of these guys too.  We named him Earl the Squirrel.  I found out upon bringing him to the Wildlife Rehab Center that squirrels of this age (just out of the nest) don't really understand danger and routinely approach people, just like Ruppert did.  Earl did the same to me, hopping onto my foot and looking scared.  You would think squirrels would have evolved a better sense of fear after all these years.  Nevertheless, Earl was super fun to have.  We used to nap on the couch together and watch Jeopardy.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've had this all my life but never knew it had a name!  I have asked eye doctors about it, but none of them have ever told me about visual snow.  Makes it incredibly difficult to see at night, especially things like holes in the ground while walking in the dark.  Glad to know it's a real thing, and I'm not just completely insane. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm just finding this thread now, and I'm thrilled there is a subreddit for horses!  Here are my two Morgans, Baby (chestnut) and Rillo (bay).  Baby is Rillo's mom, so it's a family affair when we show!

<TEXT> Just found this subreddit now!  Some great Saddlebred magazines are:

Saddle and Bridle - http://www.saddleandbridle.com/
The National Horseman - http://www.tnh1865.com/
Saddle Horse Report - http://www.saddlehorsereport.com/

Also, this is a complete list of books written specifically about Saddlebreds: http://www.trot.org/forum/showthread.php?t=2158 however many of these you would have to find used/vintage.

From a fellow Saddlebred lover, I hope this helps! </TEXT>
