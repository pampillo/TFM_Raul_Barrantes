<TEXT> I had a reoccurring nightmare as a kid. It wasn't as classically horrible as a demon face or being chased or anything like that. In my dream I had a bird's-eye view of my bedroom, except that there was nothing in it at all (no furniture, no toys, not even carpeting) and the walls and floor were painted a perfect, seamless, unblemished white. I would look down from the ceiling of my room and directly below me was a brown circle that over the months I came to realize was the top of someone's head, but that was all I could see of them, the top of their head. I have no idea to this day who that person was. I would stare down at this unmoving person for a time, unable to move or say anything, then slowly the ceiling would recede straight up, taking me with it. But the strangest thing was that in my peripheral  could tell that the walls were still attached, but that they weren't stretching up with me. It's really hard to explain that in my unavoidable concentration on this person's head as it receded dozens of feet below me slowly but surely that I could tell that on the sides I was only five or so feet above them still. I felt like I was drifting in a way, and my stomach felt strangely sunken, as if it were collapsing in on itself. To make matters worse for the entirety of this nightmare Mary Had A Little Lamb would play voicelessly on repeat in the background. This nightmare scared me in a way that I couldn't articulate at such a young age and still have trouble with today. It's really difficult to get across accurately just how empty, alone, small, and terrified I felt drifting up on that ceiling away from the only other sign of life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That is the only story from those books that actually scared/disturbed me. I still can't think about it and it's been 8+ years. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, it would be interesting to know what is was, but I can only feel that you dodged a bullet not getting first hand experience. Thanks for sharing and I hope you find out some day, or at least find someone with a similar experience to talk to.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did some more research and you are right. It definitely was real, although it was hard to find anything concrete about the show at first. The actress was a bust for anything concrete, the publisher I found for it was a bust, and imdb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Wikipedia were no help. However, I did find a thread by someone that was able to answer pretty much all questions, or at least hypothesize sufficiently. Here is the link http://forums.henshinjustice.com/showthread.php?95276-Vitsie-the-Videositter 

Just wanna say thanks for the post! </TEXT>

<TEXT> "The real scary part is that nobody knows who / or what made this show. We don't know if it was a real TV show, or if it was even aired by a TV Studio."

This is some Candle Cove shit right here. I think my nightmares are bad enough thanks to reddit without this adding to it. Though it would be interesting to talk to someone that actually watched this show as a kid. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I still think Mr. Green is behind everything. Maybe he killed his wife or maybe she really did commit suicide, Nicole doesn't give much detail about the wife, and consequentially whatever motives Mr.Green might have for killing her. However, either way it would be easy to find a motive for him killing all those high school girls. Plus he would have the strength, influence, and access to the school to pull off something like multiple murders of students at the school. As for Nicole missing, Mr.Green knows she is looking into the murders quite a bit, is somewhat estranged from her father who does happen to be an ex-cop, and she looks up to himself as an uncle. This would be the perfect opportunity to not only get rid of a possible future liability, but to also fulfill the the last letter of his wife's name. Most likely he completed the "ritual", for lack of a better term, at his house when she came over for tea. It sure doesn't seem like the authorities questioned him very well. I would say press harder on Mr.Green, he may be holding her for some reason, at the very least I believe he knows more than he is leading on. Good luck and I hope you find your daughter sir. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ugh, this is too real. I sleep on an air mattress with only a snuggie for a blanket. So I'm low to the ground and barely covered, and the other night I woke up at like 2am and my blanket was hanging over the back of my desk chair. Long story short I was very cold for the rest of the night. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That would be horrifying, but at least there is plenty of evidence. Also, a basic drawing or blueprint of your floor would help greatly. </TEXT>
