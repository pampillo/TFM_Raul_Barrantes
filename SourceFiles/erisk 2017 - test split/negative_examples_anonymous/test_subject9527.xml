<TEXT> The media made Anaconda seem like some transcendent shit too. [GQ wrote an entire profile on her and how Anaconda was this secretly subversive video](http://www.gq.com/story/nicki-minaj). Nicki didn't really do much to explain what it meant when it came out initially and now she's mad that everyone missed the message. 

We kind don't know what the fuck it's supposed to be about. Hyper-sexuality? Beats pill? Coconut innuendos? Big butts?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a bit different. Taylor was parlaying her music and huge fanbase to get paid by steaming companies. Nicki, Jay, and Kanye were trying to own a streaming service and drag their fans with them. They didn't offer exclusivity, they didn't offer a better product, and they didn't really offer much to sell it wither other than pretending like they were the founding fathers in a misjudged launch.

Taylor knows the biggest asset she has is her back catalog and album which moves actual physical product like no other pop artist. She uses it as leverage against Apple. 

I'm not to convinced it's about race here. Nicki was trying to team up with people selling a product that everyone already has for free. Taylor uses a product everyone doesn't have because they expect it to be steamed most of the time. There's a scarcity of Talyor's music while there's a fuck ton of streaming services. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's probably leading up to a reveal for Kelly Reilly. It's also a little on the nose that Nic Pizzaman would choose a song with the lyrics "I live among you / well disguised" and a shot of a red background with a woman behind a camera.

She keeps mentioning these surgeries. She probably had something to do with the sex ring once and those surgeries were a result of whatever happened in those rings. Now she's is toppling the Vinci power clan one by one.  </TEXT>

AND THEN, he kind of got John McCain to apologize for calling the people at Trump's rally crazies. Trump has managed to take advantage of a dysfunctional political system and a bunch of hypocritical lightweights who don't know what to do when faced with someone so stupidly brutish. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Trump basically tried to make the same insult he always tells people. That they're losers. And he's not wrong, John McCain lost. Trump just made a hilariously stupid comparison that all captured POW's are losers and the guys not captured are winners.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Red Pill is 120 thousand fit college educated middle class men. If we really wanted to we could invade New Zealand and install a new government. We definitely have the manpower. There are plenty of veterans here. Plus everyone here knows where the magazine release is on an M16, from years of playing Call Of Duty.

Realistically the Red Pill Reaction Force would be far more effective than half the world's militaries. The Afghan military is fucked up on opium. The Iraqi army cant even do jumping jacks. Plus New Zealand has only 8 thousand military personnel the majority of whom are useless paper pushers.

I don't actually support the violent overthrow of New Zealand. I just think its kind of a fun idea conceptualy.

<TEXT> If we ban pics of girls we should just do a sitewide ban of guy pics as well. We can't have feminists fingerbanging to underage boys.

In fact, let's just ban ANY pic just to be on the safe side.

This is really just a censorship issue. There's porn of all kinds on every single site out there. There's BARELY LEGAL TEEN porn which is extremely popular. Hell, even Brooke Shields and Traci Lords put underage porn into MAINSTREAM MOVIES.

Sure we shouldn't be sexualizing naked children, but if you're going to start banning legal content just for the sake of hoping to catch illegal content, how is that any different than an officer firing into the crowd of a fleeing robber with a shotgun just to make sure he gets the bad guy?

Do just like any other site: do your DUE DILIGENCE to remove any illegal content just as any site would. But it's definitely not your responsibility to police ALL content. That's just impossible. Even 4chan is notorious for DAILY KIDDIE PORN PICS. but the mods remove them as soon as they can because they CAN'T be held accountable for other people's posts otherwise reddit would likewise be held liable for ANY instance of an illegal pic.

Even Iggy Azalea made a child porn video where she tried to seduce an underage little boy with her pussy. That was allowed on YOUTUBE. So let's not get ahead of ourselves here. It's really not about the images themselves as much as the gatekeepers in charge of SEXUALIZING THE CONTEXT according to their feminist agenda.

I've seen pics on reddit of parents and strangers posting pics of naked kids playing in a bathtub or near the shower. If ALL naked children are to be removed, those would fall under 'illegal'.

If something is sexualizing a child in an obvious manner, we can remove it, no problem. But if someone is using their feminist liberal agenda to say "THAT is sexual TO ME" then we should tell them to fuck off. I mean social justice warriors support and still buy Lena Dunham's book where she admits to MOLESTING HER LITTLE SISTER. Except it's not considered molestation because the Social Justice Warriors are in charge of setting the context. Instead of Lena Dunham the CHILD MOLESTER touching her sister's vagina, it's warped into a fun childhood game of innocent curiosity. Again, it all depends on the gatekeepers interpretation of events.

Our goal should be to stand against censorship, not give it an excuse to GROW. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bud, no tienes ni idea de lo que ests hablando. Usted no ha ledo * Por qu Ascensor * y por lo tanto no tienen la primera puta idea de con qu criterios ticos / estticas Snyder era desdeoso de las convenciones tradicionales de entrenamiento. Usted no ha ledo * Paleo Me Plenty *. Usted no lo hace, por ejemplo, sabe otra gran rgimen de Snyder despedido, o por qu. Usted no est haciendo un esfuerzo para digerir verdad o participar en un dilogo permanente tanto como corroyendo l. Pero tal vez usted est sobre-rating Snyder como el ms grande director de levantamiento de todos los tiempos. Slo est arrancado, por lo tanto, la gente piensa que levanta. Aumento de volumen de Peter Jackson es lo mismo que la rutina perezosa 3x5 representante de Snyder.

Yo podra caer tanto la jerga de la aptitud avanzada en usted, sera hacer girar su cabeza, pero no lo har. En su lugar, voy a simplemente sealar que usted no sabe lo que cualquiera de los diferentes modos de ascensores muertos son, o cmo apoderarse de la regeneracin del tejido muscular. Nunca se ha ledo y no sabes que gente como Miln de Crotona, Galeno, o Frederic Delavier son- y esos son slo los biggies. Usted ha ledo / visto casi nada de entrenamiento con pesas clsico, si lo hay. Ciertamente no escolsticamente. Usted googled algo de mierda sobre un fsico de admiracin y copiar / pegar algo escrito en / r / fitness que usted no tiene ninguna base para la comprensin. T- s, el poco producto mudo, ciego, al abrigo de la industria de ejercicio que usted es, contribuir a nuestra degradacin del tejido muscular del mundo y. (Ni siquiera sabes lo que eso significa, porque no sabes lo que es una buena forma). Insultas lo que eres ignorante acerca. Y eso es una cosa de mierda que hacer. Le sugiero que tome un inventario personal honesto y, a continuacin, tratar de hacer algo mejor de ti mismo. Porque ahora mismo, eres jodidamente asqueroso de leer.

You haven't read *Paleo Me Plenty*. You don't, for example, know another great regimen Snyder dismissed, or why. You aren't making an effort to truly digest or engage in an ongoing dialogue so much as corroding it. But perhaps you're over-rating Snyder as the greatest lifting director of all time. He's just ripped, therefore people think he lifts. Peter Jackson's bulking is just the same as Snyder's lazy 3x5 rep routine.

I could drop so much advanced fitness jargon on you, it would make your head spin, but I won't. Instead, I'll simply point out that you don't know what any of the different modes of dead lifts are, or how they seize upon muscle tissue regeneration. You've never read and don't know who people like Milo of Croton, Galen, or Frederic Delavier are- and those are just the biggies. You've read/seen next to no classic weight training, if any. Certainly not scholastically. You googled some shit about admiring physiques and copy/pasted something written in /r/fitness that you have no basis for understanding. You- yes the dumb, blind, sheltered little product of the exercise industry that you are, contribute to our world's and muscle tissue degradation. (You don't even know what that means because you don't know what good form is). You insult what you're ignorant about. And that's a really shitty thing to do. I suggest you take an honest personal inventory, and then try to make something better of yourself. Because right now, you're pretty fucking disgusting to read. Honestly, I think you should be ashamed of yourself, and should consider apologizing to this thread.

<TEXT> Do you motherfuckers understand now? DO YOU? Let me spell it out one more time for the densest among you.

This. Is. Not. Just. About. Video games.

These people want to destroy those of you who speak out and control the rest. You've seen them talk on twitter and tumblr, they will happily put you to death if they could and drink your tears while doing so. Video games is one front of a much larger war. It does not begin or end with video games and if you don't fight you are going to lose so much more than just a hobby. This is the end of the war, they have been winning it for years. Gamergate was a surprise resistance that popped up after our "forces" had been routed and slaughtered on the altar of social justice for decades. If you want to live in a world where some histrionic pampered brat and her sniveling cohorts can cry harassment and shut down entire websites then yeah sure do nothing just protect the vidya I guess. If that idea disgusts you then it is time to stand up if you haven't already and fight them on every level. Remember Shirtgate? Remember how they made a motherfucking scientist cry on what should have been the best day of his life? Over a shirt? It's not just about video games these people are monsters in human skin. Fight them! </TEXT>

If that idea disgusts you then it is time to stand up if you haven't already and fight them on every level. Remember /u/nukethepope[2]  ? Remember how fucking brave he is? Because of his logic?

<TEXT> Here's the thing. You said "Sanders is a socialist."

Is he in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.

As someone who is on the internet who reads /r/politics, I am telling you, specifically, in the Berniesphere, no one calls Sanders a socialist. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying "socialist family" you're referring to the political grouping of leaders who aren't scumbags, which includes things from Democratic Socialists to unions to Europeans.

So your reasoning for calling Sanders a socialist is because random people "call the raising the minimum wage socialism?" Let's get free broadband and healthcare in there, then, too.

Also, calling Donald Trump an average Republican or a racist? It's not one or the other, that's not how politics works. He's both. Bernie is a Social Democrat and a member of the socialist family. But that's not what you said. You said Sanders is a socialist, which is not true unless you're okay with calling everyone who isn't a a corporate puppet a socialist, which means you'd call Ron Paul, Alex Jones, and /r/politics socialists, too. Which you said you don't.

It's okay to just admit you're a corporate shill, you know?

<TEXT> My wife and I attended Bernies rally in Dallas. That morning, she called her dad to ask if our youngest daughter, who stayed the night with him last night, could remain at his house until this evening. She mentioned that she and I were going to be out of town and, when he asked where we were going, she nonchalantly said that we were going to see Bernie Sanders speak. Her father, who is probably a 2%er, flipped a biscuit. He started screaming that he could not believe that his daughter would even entertain the idea of voting for a 'self-described socialist who wants to make the entire country a welfare state.' My wife, who is pretty easily flustered, allowed him to vent. She then stated that, 'he hasn't earned my vote yet, daddykins, I just want to hear what he has to say.' Her father then yelled, 'if you go that rally, you are out of the will!' (He's generally a calm person; I personally think he'd been drinking, but he is very much right wing). My wife then said something I will never forget: 'Bernie Sanders can't be bought. What makes you think I can, daddy-o? The threat of me losing my inheritance is not going to stop me from doing what is right. I am going and the fact that you are threatening me is undemocratic and not very dank.' He then promptly hung up on her. Then everyone applauded and gave her a $100% bill. My wife's name? Albert Einstein. I LOVE MY WIFE!!! Just wanted to share.

No empieza ni termina con videojuegos y si no luchas que se va a perder mucho ms que slo un hobby. Este es el final de la guerra, han estado ganando durante aos. Gamergate era una resistencia sorpresa que apareci despus de nuestras "fuerzas" haban sido derrotados y sacrificados en el altar de la justicia social desde hace dcadas. Si quieres vivir en un mundo donde algunos mocoso mimado histrinica y sus cohortes llorones pueden llorar hostigamiento y cerrar sitios web completos entonces s seguro no hacer nada simplemente proteger el vidya supongo. Si la idea te repugna, entonces es hora de ponerse de pie, si no lo ha hecho y luchar contra ellos en todos los niveles. Recuerde Shirtgate?

<TEXT> Do you motherfuckers understand now? DO YOU? Let me spell it out one more time for the densest among you.

This. Is. Not. Just. About. Video games.

These people want to destroy those of you who speak out and control the rest. You've seen them talk on twitter and tumblr, they will happily put you to death if they could and drink your tears while doing so. Video games is one front of a much larger war. It does not begin or end with video games and if you don't fight you are going to lose so much more than just a hobby. This is the end of the war, they have been winning it for years. Gamergate was a surprise resistance that popped up after our "forces" had been routed and slaughtered on the altar of social justice for decades. If you want to live in a world where some histrionic pampered brat and her sniveling cohorts can cry harassment and shut down entire websites then yeah sure do nothing just protect the vidya I guess. If that idea disgusts you then it is time to stand up if you haven't already and fight them on every level. Remember Shirtgate? Remember how they made a motherfucking scientist cry on what should have been the best day of his life? Over a shirt? It's not just about video games these people are monsters in human skin. Fight them!

<TEXT> A liberal muslim homosexual ACLU lawyer professor and abortion doctor was teaching a class on Karl Marx, known atheist
Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Marx and accept that he was the most highly-evolved being the world has ever known, even greater than Jesus Christ!
At this moment, a brave, patriotic, pro-life Navy SEAL champion who had served 1500 tours of duty and understood the necessity of war and fully supported all military decision made by the United States stood up and held up a rock.
How old is this rock, pinhead?
The arrogant professor smirked quite Jewishly and smugly replied 4.6 billion years, you stupid Christian
Wrong. Its been 5,000 years since God created it. If it was 4.6 billion years old and evolution, as you say, is real then it should be an animal now
The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of Origin of the Species. He stormed out of the room crying those liberal crocodile tears. The same tears liberals cry for the poor (who today live in such luxury that most own refrigerators) when they jealously try to claw justly earned wealth from the deserving job creators. There is no doubt that at this point our professor, DeShawn Washington, wished he had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and become more than a sophist liberal professor. He wished so much that he had a gun to shoot himself from embarrassment, but he himself had petitioned against them!
The students applauded and all registered Republican that day and accepted Jesus as their lord and savior. An eagle named Small Government flew into the room and perched atop the American Flag and shed a tear on the chalk. The pledge of allegiance was read several times, and God himself showed up and enacted a flat tax rate across the country.
The professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day. He died of the gay plague AIDS and was tossed into the lake of fire for all eternity.
Semper Fi.

<TEXT> We're all white on the Ellen Pao and the lack of chemistry between Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway, Natalie and Ashton actually make a great writer because his ideas survived long enough to get into a place for all sorts of things wrong with the legality of creating your own life, or how you view your own life, or how they seize upon muscle tissue degradation.

Eh, maybe not in the height department but I can assure you I've grown more than most people will in the more important categories.
My intelligence, for example, has grown to the point where I am now a revered member of my local MENSA branch and have astonished many learned experts in various scientifical fields with insights formed after only a cursory glance at their field of study. I read the entire works of authors such as James Joyce, Albert Camus, Stephen King and George Orwell before my teenage years. I was awarded a delta for the first CMV post I ever made, and I only really argue with people on Reddit for my own amusement.
Perhaps you'd like to hear about my stunning and exponential growth in the weights room, too? How about my success with maidens from all over Europe?
You probably like to make jokes about your height at my expense because it's the only thing you have going for you. So yeah, you might be taller than me, but at the end of the day, do I care? No. I have more important things to worry about, like the one million word novel I'm currently writing, adding to my $50,000 wardrobe, or adding to my impressive list of bullet hell game regional hiscores.

<TEXT> I'm not sure if you're trolling or just have no idea who I am, but I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt. In addition to almost 7 years as a confessed meme addict, I have moderated the largest meme forum on the Internet (at over 2 million subscribers) for over a year. You think I don't know memes? In that time I have removed over 400posts for not following subreddit guidelines. In addition to my moderation responsibilities I am one of the most active writers on knowyourmeme.com. You think I don't know memes? Then how do I write articles about them on a site called knowyourmeme? Several mainstream blogs have contacted me to ask about the recent meme phenomenon and each has been thankful and enlightened with what I had to tell them. It's not just limited to blogs though. Several companies have asked me to review their meme ads to avoid a failure like Toyota's meme commercial. Just last week a major food company contacted me with a paid offer to help them on a new ad campaign. I declined when I researched the company and saw that they had contributed money to socially conservative groups.
It's safe to say that I am one of the world's foremost experts on memes and in fact there is no one I can think of that has a meme resume as impressive as mine. So please tell me, what are your qualifications to say that I don't know what a meme is?

<TEXT> So you have figured out that the majority of /r/atheism isn't very happy with religion and believe that religions are pretty silly. You might find some of this shit offensive even. You might even feel that you need to post about how much /r/atheism sucks.

I have a 10 step plan in order for you to correct this issue.

1. Go fuck yourself. This is a crucial step, and will be recommended should you decide to openly voice your concerns about /r/atheism. Might as well get this out of the way so when it is recommended, you can proudly claim 'I've done that already' and the discussion can continue. A broken bottle is ideal, but whatever tool you have available it fine, even if it is a portal gun.

2. Repeat step 1 to ensure completion.

3. Unsubscribe. You don't HAVE to be here, you don't HAVE to read the memes, sagan quotes, and dumbasses on facebook. Red button on the right. Go away, we don't want you.

4. Repeat step 1 again.

5. Understand our user base. If you live in the UK, you might legitimately not understand a LARGE portion of our users. Google the Bible belt. I will wait..... Ok, that's long enough. There are many atheist teens in the Bible belt, whom stay in the proverbial closet to prevent bad shit from happening to them. This includes something as trivial as being cut off from college (which in the US is not a right, but a paid privilege), to something as sever as being thrown in the streets or (in the rare case) murdered. There have been users on here asking for help due to parents wanting to involuntarily commit them to a psyche ward for their atheism. This subreddit is for them to vent.

6. Repeat step 1

7. We have every reason to hate religion. While we don't necessarily hate religious people, we do find their beliefs silly and worth mocking. However, religion is responsible for many deaths in Iran, Sudan, and the Bible Belt, especially among this particular faith known as Christian Science, which believes prayer is a legitimate alternative to MEDICINE and SURGERY, which sometimes ends up killing the unfortunate kid.

8. Repeat step one, one last time.

9. If you are still here and have concerns, discuss. If not, unsubscribe button is on the right, have a nice day and don't forget to go fuck yourself.

10. Go fuck yourself.

<TEXT> So I was standing in a rather large line at my local Wal-Mart today behind a couple families that I know from when I went to church with my family in year younger. It was the only register open so there wasn't much of another option to get my 12 pack of Mountain Dew for a party I was heading to. I was wondering why the line was going nowhere when I decided to poke my head up front to see what the holdup was. It was a little old lady who didn't have enough for her groceries and she was trying to talk the cashier into letting her get away with being short. This struck me as odd until I found out she was a mere $0.21 short of her purchase. Now all these families were just staring and there was even two making fun of her. I walked up and handed my soda to the cashier, handed him a $5 and told her to keep the change. One of the middle aged women (I knew these people, so I also knew that they all make over 6 digits) grabbed her kid and yelled very loudly, "See that man? He's acting just like Jesus wants us to." For some reason this set me off, so I turned around. I haven't shaved in awhile so I'm rocking some nice scruff, a Slayer shirt, and gym shorts, so it must have been a nice sight. Very loudly, I said "Like Jesus? Ma'am I'm an atheist who makes minimum wage and I was the one who stepped up to help her? Your hypocritical Christianity is an inspiration to us all." As I stormed out, a couple of the cart boys started to whistle and cheer, soon shoppers joined in and even the cashier. I gave a wave and went off with a feeling of accomplishment.

<TEXT> Listen closely, my fellow brethren: do not despair. today is a dark day indeed. But not all is lost. On the contrary, the only thing that we have lost is the time it will take to build our beautiful, fit community back to what it was. We can ALWAYS rebuild; do not ever forget that, and do not them try to tell you otherwise.
They will taunt.
They will laugh.
They will mock
They will eat. Oh boy, will they eat.
I say to you: ignore them. For they would not be so quick to salt the wound if they thought there were no truths to our stance.
We need your help to piece things back together. Keep doing what you've always done: Post quality content on our sub. And tell everyone you can to flock here, for there is always strength in numbers.
This may have been a harsh blow, but don't forget that we are winning the war! We aren't the ones with heart disease, broken joints, and diabetes. We aren't the ones who have difficulty fitting into airplane seats or breathing unassisted. We aren't the ones who are going to die at 40!
Remember this, and remember it well!
Remember our cause!
Stand together!
And FIGHT ON!
HUZZAH, HUZZAH!

<TEXT> It should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here, as far as I know.

That said.

In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area.

An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.

My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it.

I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).

I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.

Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories.

I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.

I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.

I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.

I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things.

I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.

I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care.

The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them.

I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit "women are crazy" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome.

That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that).

I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments).

And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator.

All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me?

<TEXT> I honestly think I have a serious problem in regards to this. I have ALWAYS wanted to smells women's panties for as long as I can remember. I remember that their was this hot teachers assistant in my preschool and I always wanted to sniff her chair after she would get up, I came really close to doing it a couple times. Then the first time I actually got a hold of some real panties was at my friends house when I was around 15, his mom would go jogging in the same sweats everyday and leave the thong she had worn right next to the sweats. I still remember that pungent smell of her vagina and that stinky smell of her ass, her vagina would always leave behind globs of cumm on the sweats and panties and I would run my teeth across it to scrape it off and taste her sweet cumm. Oh and by the way my friends mom was HOTT, I don't mean conventional hot I mean pornstar hot, I put a post of her on /r/milf[1] and she got close to 1000 upvotes, me and another friend think she bares a striking resemblance to Lisa Ann. Then at my other friends house I walked into his bathroom and their in the hamper were his sisters dirty panties. I stayed in the toilet for an hour smelling and licking them, THOSE were the best panties I have ever smelled. She was 23 and her panties were these extra small super bright colored hollitster panties and they had streaks on the vagina part but most importantly they had streaks on the ass crack part, not poo stains but rather sweat ass stains. But my most recent venture in smelling panties has been my mother in laws panties, my wifes mother. She's definitely a milf too but more of a real life "hot mom", and every chance I get (lets say her mother in law is sleeping and my wife is in the bathroom I) I rummage through her hamper and take a pair out and steal them to jerk off with. Her mom is pretty hot she's thick but in a good way, she has a flat stomach but a HUGE ass she wears a XL thong. My wife has a huge ass too and I'm talking about actually big (she's from Brazil) but my mother in law's ass is godly, she would put Kim K away no exaggeration. I just love to picture that tight thong swallowed up in her ass and collecting that sweet ass sweat and stench. I'm waaaaaaaaaaaaay more obsessed with the whole ass smell, I just love thinking that the panties have been rubbing up against that particular women's asshole all day. Don't get me wrong I'm not into shit or feces, what I like is the asshole and that stench a women might get from showing in the morning, then doing errands all day and finally working out to get that natural animal like stench oozing out of their ass crack. I really like the smell of a women when she is bent over doggy style and her ass stinks and the smell is wafting up to my nose with every thrust. Every time I have sex with my wife I eat out her asshole EVERYTIME, that is unless she feels really dirty because she hasn't showered has diarrhea or some thing like that. I am currently majoring in psychology and a couple years ago I pinpointed why I have this obsession with panties and the anal area.

<TEXT> should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here, as far as I know. That said. In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it. I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).

<TEXT> /r/movies[1] is 7.6 million fit college educated middle class cinephiles. If we really wanted to we could invade Hollywood and install a new government. We definitely have the manpower. There are plenty of /r/Movies[2] Veterans here. Plus everyone here knows how to throw a punch with the right hand, from years of watching Fight Club.
Realistically the /r/Movies[3] Reaction Force would be far more effective than half the world's cinephiles. The /r/TrueFilm[4] cinephiles are fucked up on opium. The /r/Flicks[5] cinephiles cant even do jumping jacks. Plus Hollywood has only 8 thousand film critics, the majority of whom are useless paper pushers.
I don't actually support the violent overthrow of Hollywood. I just think its kind of a fun idea conceptualy.

<TEXT> Y'know, after reading all these Age of Ultron reviews where non-fans complained about how insular, incoherent and confusing the film was, it's starting to seem like the deeper we go into these films the more exclusionary they are going to become to normal fans. 

The inclusion of deep cut Marvel characters like Ulysses Klaw, Ultron, or The Vision just confuses these people. To them these characters seem really undeveloped or shallow, but to fans the characters have already been very, very meticulously developed, so we don't really need all that much exposition to make sense of it. Almost as if the films were made specifically for us.

When the film says "Ultron is going to Wakanda to get vibranium by way of Ulysses Klaw." The normie says to himself, "What? Who? I have no idea what any of those things are or why Ultron is doing that." While the fan says, "Yeah, if Ultron wants to create world peace by wiping out all human life, and vibranium is key to his plan, he may want to hit up Klaw, since he's stolen a shitload of the substance over the years. Makes sense."

Eventually we're going to get to the point where the normies just don't care anymore because they're too confused and don't want to do the homework That's going to result in a drop off in the amount of money these films make. There's still plenty of people out there who will go see these films, and I'm sure that will always justify spending two-hundred million dollars on them, so they're always going to be around, but they're going to become a lot more like actual comics. Impenetrable for people who aren't deeply immersed in this universe. 

You know what I say to that? 

GOOD. 

I don't care if normies are into this shit. I don't really want these characters to be massive, ubiquitous pulp culture phenomenons if that means we have to spend an entire film expositing to people who don't know what's going on. 

These films should be made for the fans. People who aren't hostile to the notion of an extended, interconnected film universe that requires a familiarity with what has come before. Let the normies go back to watching sports, or the Bachelor or whatever the fuck the were into before this stuff came along. 

If they're tired of playing with the toys I've been playing with since I was 6, then I'll take them back. No problem. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's why I used the albacore/tuna analogy. What we call "tuna" are many species in the Thunnis genus or, perhaps more broadly, the Thunnini tribe. What we call a species and what it's taxonomical name is are two different things.
Put another way, either all Corvus species are crows or none of them are, depending on which nomenclature you're using. It's an entirely semantic argument. The jackdaw is corvus monedula while the New Caledonian crow is corvus moneduloides. Of course, our names for those species are "jackdaw" and "crow." However, like how "tuna" refers to all species in the genus Thunnus or the tribe Thunnini, there are also species called XXX tuna and species without tuna in the name. It doesn't make them not tuna, it just means that the common name for them doesn't include the word tuna.
"Cat" refers to any feline in the felis genus, specifically. You've got your domesticated variety which are called, I shit you not, felis catus, but you've also got jungle cats, sand cats, wild cats, etc. Also, "cat" appears in other genera with "cat" in the name as well as Felidae being literally referred to as the "cat family." "People in science" would definitely refer to a group containing tigers and lions as "large cats."
So, in sum, in the common language, all felidae are cats, all thunnini are tuna, and all corvus are crows. The jackdaw, in particular, is much more like a crow than most ravens. It's really the only odd one out, because there's only two species, one named after the other, which was named arbitrarily (I just looked it up, in either middle or old English, jack meant "small" and daw meant "bird"). Turns out the jackdaw is a type of crow. It seems like some people want to put it into it's own genus, which might still be problematic because I've heard people refer to Corvidae, as a family as crows, also. I wouldn't call a blue jay a crow, but I'd call jackdaws crows. Fuck jackdaws.

<TEXT> I will just preface this by saying I am in fact 17 years old, I am white, and I do live in America. Do I think my problems are worse than that of the people in Ethiopia? Yes, yes I do. I can explain to you in detail.
I am being spied on constantly. They watch what I do, they read my emails, and they probably snicker at the things I watch, and you act like you know oppression? Those Ethiopians get hurt, sure, but the time is going to come when the US government will arrest me simply for not agreeing with them. Where men and women will not have their say any where. And for now, we have to pay a tax for people who live off welfare (lazy bastards) who won't do anything with it and will only buy drugs and beer, even Kafka would find this shit unbelievable. You act smug to people like me, but you don't even know the half of it.

<TEXT> Here's the thing. You said "vote manipulation is cheating the site."
Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.
As someone who is a scientist who studies web forums, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls multi-voting cheating. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.
If you're saying "vote manipulation family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of votidae, which includes things from posting quality original content to asking strangers for upvotes to running vote-bots through proxies. So your reasoning for calling multi-voting cheating is because random people "call the unusual votes cheating?" Let's get copypasta and image macros in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A bot-vote is a bot-vote and a type of vote manipulation. But that's not what you said. You said vote manipulation is cheating, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the vote manipulation family cheating, which means you'd call good posting, bad posting, and copypasta cheating, too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?

<TEXT> This one time I was in traffic in new yogurt where obviously the hottest mladies reside. So I really had to get to this important event (neckbeard furry convention, don't judge me it's a primal instinct) and the cats wouldn't move. Sweat pearls were forming under my hillbilly because I knew my fellow neckbeard brothers were waiting for me to give an epic speech about furries. But most importantly my waifu was waiting for me. So I honked a few times and this douchdoge came out of his Ferrarighini pasta tortellini in front of me and told me to fite rite here rite now. So I got out of the car and threw my two ninja katana stars in his eyes. Upon him falling to the ground, I took a big sip out my mtn dew bottle and shoved a couple of le doritos down my throat. After that I cruised away in the douchbages Ferrari and on my way to the furry convention the douchbage's two hot girlfriends gave me BJs and that's how I lost my virginity.

<TEXT> I've been on this supp called "Muscle Death" that reinhibits your muscletrophin or some shit and it says to stop after 2 days because it's so hardcore. Took it for a year, pretty sure I've been dead for months now but it's cool because I'm big at the discoteque I feel big I feel important I feel effective like I could move people around if I wanted like chess pieces, like if this girl grinds on me I could move her with my arms like I have control of my environment you know what I'm saying? Like if my dick went limp I'd just flex my tris and there'd be no.... shame. Like I'd rather die than not feel effective. I'd rather die on this fucking magic powder than feel like a grain of sand on the fucking beach like life doesn't welcome me, like the vital girls in this room don't think I could move them without making a face. They want... No they need someone to move them. They need it. They are looking around that discoteque for someone that can move them. This powder says it can give me the stature to be that guy. I'd rather die on this powder than be the guy that can't move a girl, can't move anybody. I'm just a spectator unless I take this powder and the more the better. It says take one scoop I take 8. Let's move shit. Life is a joke nobody wants to be the punchline though. I take this powder and ignore my social life for a couple of years so I can be something solid, something with mass, something that can move. Something effective and affective. Walk up in a room and be like damn that guy didn't talk to anyone for years and now he looks like he can move anyone here. What the fuck happened to that guy? He apparently lifted and shunned the world for 2 years so he could become effective. If he felt effective he could feel as if something matters on this grey ass planet of meaninglessness, he could move people. It worked though, he's big as shit now and seems to be moving people but I heard his dad used to be big as shit too but that he's got heart issues now and shriveled up. Like you build all that effectiveness up just to watch it waste away. Like life is just a study of regression. We build castles of sand to watch them wash away and being effective ain't even important. We build our own towers of Babel and they just crash down and it's almost worse to have to witness the crash than to never be high to begin with. I hear he hates himself, and his dad for exemplifing his greatest fear, that what he felt was important wasn't at all. The powder is false. Everybody is false. I hear he's effective now but he sees his father in himself and knows one day he too will shrivel up. That this makes him sad and he can't even enjoy his effectiveness anymore. All that work for nothing. All that work for nothing. All that work for nothing. All that work for nothing. All that work for nothing. Fuck, it's like we don't even realize our own death. We conceptualize as something that it's not, like it's so far away that I can't be bothered with it now. Like you have to be a bleeding heart to even actualize it, nobody does. Like oh here is this so edgy guy playing the part of the guy that thinks he's being deep by talking about death... he's so typical. I'm so clever because I can recognize the guy trying to be clever, and point it out, which rectifies my own delusion of being clever and immortal and above all of this. I better reply to this to reflect back into myself how above these thoughts I am, and if I get some upvotes I'll be even more validated of my own immortality and meaning. I'm not done. How can he hate is father? Well he was his father's son, grew up believing that what his father pointed out as meaningful would truly be meaningful. But as his father grew old his son realized that the direction he had been led towards was false, he couldn't figure anything out. It's all a spiral after that, the fathers realization of meaninglessness reflecting into the very eyes of his own creation. It's a tragedy and not even that matters. The old man had given his son the one thing that should never be passed down, the clarity of sickness the clarity of ill health the clarity of nothingness and voidness and ineffectiveness. That all people are impotent. That all people are sterile. Life is impotent. The nurses cleaning up the bed pans couldn't give you the answer. Hell the surgeons operating on his heart to the best of techno music surely couldn't give you the answer. Nobody's got it. Everybody's just doing the motions that solve their cost function. We've all got one you know, a cost function. A measure of importance imparted on every neuron that determines their specific weights in the influence on the grand network, our brains. These cost functions are usually shaped by genetics, environment, and influence. When these cost functions are determined to be false what is a person to do? He's left to sit in prolonged apathy towards every one and every thing, some call it depression. "Keep your head up, join a gym, meet a girl at the discoteque ", they say. Hilarious. They haven't invalidated their cost function yet, what do they know but what delusions they reside in. Alright that's it, the acetate is wearing off - Hitchens knows, I've seen it happen

I seriously doubt I'm unusual in this respect; in 20 years time more than a few of us are going to be in positions of serious power and we may see some positive change from that alone. No need to invade anyone, climb the ladder and shit on the degenerates from above.

We aren't all squealing uncontrollable little kids (there's a minority of those though that you all seem to complain about all the time and not acknowledge that there are actually some of us out here more mature than the majority of older teens and some adults). Some of us choose to give our demographic a bad reputation with the Internet, while others use the Internet to gain knowledge and wisdom.

<TEXT> I've been to more countries than you have had sexual partners. I've killed more people than you've even had real altercations with. I don't need to play passive aggressive bitch and "win" with you. You're a pussy and you have no idea what or who I am. The fact that you're a fucking idiot on top of thinking you have me pegged is funny. Oh and you're little joke about my brevity, grammar, etc is funny. What is your education? I'm about to go to medical school to be a neurologist. AND I've served in the Marines and have been to war twice. What in the fuck have you done? What will you ever do that will compare to my contributions to humanity? You're a child. A mad little child that will never be a spec on my radar.

<TEXT> [this isnt like a rant about how my parents and other people tell me ill change my mind when im older or some spawns being dicks and have the energy to annoy you all day]
Im visiting some relatives right now, and my cousin is in the picture somewhere, shes 5 y/o.
Anyway when I arrive I start to unpack, I also have some snacks in my bag that I brought for me and only me.
I leave my room and go to the living room to talk with everyone else, meanwhile she just cant stay in one place and basically walks everywhere around the house. Eventually she ends up in my room and takes out some kit kat from my stuff. Her mom finds her in my room, with her fingers and chin covered in my chocolate and comes to tell all of us how cute it is.. Wtf. No.
Later, Im browsing reddit on my phone and she sees me holding my phone and just tells me "Give me your phone, I want to play games". After I refuse she is obviously pissed and tells her parents and her brother, and they actually agreed that I should give her my phone so she can play games.
Although that doesnt surprise me cause my family kind of always lacked money and some logic, but these relatives, they are in a TON of bank loan, and were in the same situation when they decided to have another spawn. I really dont understand the "more kids more happiness" logic.
Also sorry for my english as its not my native language and for my formatting, submitting this from phone.

Ill have you know I graduated top of my discussion thread in /r/movies and Ive been involved in numerous secret raids on /r/dc_cinematic and I have over 300 confirmed shadowbans. I am trained in genre warfare and Im the top Marvel fan in the entire /r/marvelstudios subreddit. You are nothing to me but just another pretentious snob. I will rate this movie 10/10 on IMDB with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit about Marvel over the Internet? Think again, pleb. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of Spy Thrillers across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. Youre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and thats just with my bare hulk gloves. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldnt, you didnt, and now youre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit Nick Fury all over you and you will drown in it. Youre fucking dead, kiddo.

<TEXT> I hole-hardedly agree, but allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment. For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go. Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the facts. You might have to come to this conclusion through denial and error but I swear on my mother's mating name that when you put the petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like its a peach of cake.

<TEXT> Greetings, everyone. I am new. (One second  let me get this spork out of the way.) My name is Katy, but you can call me the Penguin of Doom. (Im laughing aloud.) As you can plainly see, my actions have no pattern whatsoever. That is why I have come here. To meet similarly patternless individuals, such as myself.

I am 13  mature for my age, however!  and I enjoy watching Invader Zim with my girlfriend. (I am bisexual. Please approach this subject maturely.) It is our favorite television show, as it adequately displays stochastic manners of behavior such as we possess.

She behaves without order  of course  but I wish to meet more individuals of her and my kind. As the saying goes, the more, the merrier.

Ah, it is to laugh. Anyway, I hope to make many friends here, so please comment freely.

Doom!

That is simply one of many examples of my random actions. Ha, ha. Fare thee well. I wish you much love and waffles.

Yours,

<TEXT> I'm kinda ashamed to admit this, but I don't make a lot of money. I work thirty-two hours a week as a cashier for a local fast-food restaurant and barely have enough to pay my part of the rent and utilities. I live in a two bedroom apartment with four other people. There is a walk-in storage closet in the kitchen that was just big enough for a twin bed and a night stand. It isn't much, but it is home. On the plus side, I don't have to go far to get a midnight snack. On the downside I have to walk across the apartment to use the bathroom. 

Being a member of the working-poor and living in a closet doesn't exactly translate into adoration from the opposite sex. I have below-average social skills and I'm not what anyone would describe as handsome. I'm the kind of guy who would have to pay for sex, but as I mentioned, I can barely pay rent. After two hundred bucks for a closet and my part of the utilities, which is usually just as much, I have a little over a hundred bucks a month to spend on food and personal items. 

As one could imagine, I spend most of my downtime locked in my room using a cheap Android tablet to browse the internet in an attempt to find something to occupy my mind in the hours between sleep and slaving away at Burger Hell. Like most men with no social life and zero chance of finding a consenting adult to touch their genitals, this includes a fair amount of porn consumption. 

For the past few years I have wanted a Fleshlight. For those who aren't inundated with ads every time they load up a page showing a redheaded schoolgirl taking oral instruction from a well hung instructor; a Fleshlight is a soft penile masturbation sleeve held within a rigid case that resembles a flashlight. The mouth of the device slides over the, well you know. For lonely guys it is the closest we come to experiencing sex. I've always wanted one, but I cannot afford to spend $58.95 for the base model. 

I was browsing through used sex toys on Ebay when something caught my eye. The headline read:

Slightly used homemade Fleshlight. Has been cleaned. Must go.

The buy it now price was listed at five dollars and it had free shipping. Excited, I put in my paypal information and waited for the masturbatory device to arrive in the mail from Bob's Taxidermy. Three days later I was excited to receive a small package in the mail. I spirited it away to my closet and opened it to some disappointment. The vacuum sealed package was that of a normal plastic Rayovac flashlight. I pulled off the bulb to see what appeared to be a leather facsimile of a vagina. The pamphlet that came with the device read, Use Enclosed oil on exterior and inner lining after washing with warm soapy water after each use.

Later that night I tried it out. The texture was a little off, but it actually felt halfway similar to the real thing. Content with my purchase, I put it in the drawer of my nightstand. It might sound strange, but this tiny little adjustment to my life improved my confidence. I performed better at work. I was more comfortable talking to girls. As strange as it may sound, I started to fall in love with this five dollar used sexy toy I'd found on ebay. 

One night after a particularly furious self-pleasuring, I fell asleep with the Fleshlight still attached if you know what I mean. That night I was treated to violent dreams of a sweaty old man grabbing me by the throat and choking the life out of me. I woke from this dream to the sensation of the Fleshlight moving back and forth. For a brief moment I thought a saw a grandmotherly woman riding on top of me. I wiped the sleep from my eyes and pulled the Fleshlight off. After a thorough cleaning I put it back in the drawer.

It was an odd night, but I'd had weirder dreams. I chalked it up to the Chantix I'd started the day before and a significant decrease in my smoking habit. I went to work as scheduled and returned home to see my roommates standing around the television. A man in New Hampshire had been arrested by the FBI for murdering his wife and using his skills as a taxidermist to hide the body in various homemade objects which he sold online. I shuddered at the thought and returned to my closet. I pulled up the news story on my tablet and opened a new tab to enjoy my Fleshlight to the stylings of a lonely housewife being serviced by a plumber with an uncharacteristically ripped physique. 

I was about halfway through my session when there was a knock on my door. I covered myself with a blanket and said, Come in.

It was my roommate Jamie. He stood in the doorway and said, 

Hey, that package you got last week. The box was in the trash. What did you order?

I panicked and said, Oh nothing, just a stuffed lizard I gave a guy at work.

Jamie grimaced and said, You might wanna call him. The box was from Bob's Taxidermy, that lizard is made from that crazy guy's wife. He choked her to death and cut her into a bunch of pieces he sold online. The cops are tracking down all the people who bought his items. They'll probably be here any day now.

Jamie closed the door and I looked at the slight bulge in my blanket caused by the Fleshlight attached to my then flaccid member. I read the article and sure enough, Miriam Johansen had been murdered and shipped all over the country. I thought about the dream and the resulting straddling I felt after. Mortified, I pulled the thing off of me and cleaned it thoroughly. I was too scared to throw it away and freaked out by its presence. I'd been masturbating with a vagina cut from a murdered woman and fashioned into a forever alone fuck sleeve. My panic intensified. 

Ultimately, I put the macabre toy in an old shoebox and slid it under my bed. What sleep I got that night was fitful at best. I dreamt of Bob the Taxidermist choking me to death and cutting me into pieces he sold online. I woke in a cold sweat to the same grandmotherly woman sitting on the foot of my bed. She looked sad, but at the same time there was a warm feeling about her. I sat up in my bed, and wiped the sleep from my eyes as she faded into the darkness. I heard a low scraping sound on the floor and looked down to see that the shoebox had slid out from under my bed. 

I became overwhelmed by the urge to use it one last time. I pulled it out and slid it onto myself as I reached for my tablet. The tablet wouldn't turn on so I tried to think of something that would turn me on. A few strokes into the experience I felt the hand holding the Fleshlight being pulled away. Soon the other hand was lifted as well. They were pinned behind my head. Soon after I felt a tight grip on my throat. As it became harder to breathe, the grandmotherly woman became visible again. I could feel the Fleshlight moving faster and grinding further down as her expression turned to one of sheer hatred. The last thing I remember is the most intense climax of my life as I passed out from lack of oxygen. 

The next morning I was greeted by two FBI agents who found me laying naked in bed with the Fleshlight still attached to my member and deep read hand prints across my throat. As I slowly woke up and realized my precarious situation I reached for a blanket to cover myself. The taller of the two agents asked me to place the toy in a large plastic bag he was holding out. I was asked to dress myself and join him at the station. After it was all worked out I wasn't facing any charges. It didn't change the fact that my roommates found out I'd been jacking it with the taxidermied vagina of a murder victim. They in turn told my co-workers who told pretty much everyone else. People would snicker and call me corpse fucker under their breath. 

My roommates informed me that they'd prefer if I found a new place to live. I had until the end of the month to find a new place. It was much the same at work. I had been branded as a necrophile and my manager said that my presence reflected badly on the store. I was too said and too mortified from my experiences that week to even attempt to fap. So, with nothing else to do I turned on my tablet and checked my email. The first line of my inbox read.

(URGENT: PLEASE READ) Settlement information enclosed.

It was from Ebay. 

Contained within was a request for my banking information. As a result of the items made from human flesh being sold through their site, every buyer was being offered a settlement of nearly a hundred thousand dollars. I replied with my checking account and routing number. A couple days later I was rolling in the cash. I paid for a semester of college in cash and got a private dorm room. Sitting at my new desk on a recently purchased laptop I opened my web browser and bought an official Fleshlight. Even with the change in finances, I figured it unlikely I'd have sex anytime soon.

Besides, the only real sex I'd ever had included being hatefucked by a pissed off ghost.

<TEXT> Let me preface this by saying that I've been a memer since they first appeared on 4chan circa 2006 (ages ago in internet time). I remember refreshing /b/ all afternoon with the hope that someone would make a new meme. I was a memer back when Advice Dog was the only one and I still upvote every Advice Dog meme I see becasue of the fond rush of nostalgia it brings me. Nowadays, there are many thousand on quickmeme and other meme websites. I was a memer back before memegenerator was created (the first meme website) and I had to make them with MS Powerpoint or Paint. Speaking of meme websites, I was one of the first submitters to memebase.com and still have one of the top accounts there despite having migrated to reddit nearly 2 years ago. It was on 4chan and memebase where I cut my teeth creating memes, way before I had a reddit account and way before /r/adviceanimals[1] was created in late 2010. Back before I could get any sort of points or even username recognition, I was creating memes as a clever and easily digestible way to reflect on society, relate some story to my audience, or just be funny. Do you remember rich raven? No? I do. You probably don't remember depression dog, crazy girlfriend praying mantis, introspective pug, or friendzone Johnny either. I remember all of them. In fact, you have only submitted two posts to adviceanimals garnering a total of just 4 points and have not commented there any time recently. So please, respect my judgement regarding the direction of the subreddit and the integrity of posts I have held dear to my heart for nearly 7 years but you have no strong feelings for. Thanks.

<TEXT> The MCU Fanboy is completely egocentric, trapped inside himself, incapable of empathizing or identifying with others, or love, friendship, affection of tenderness. He is a completely isolated unit, incapable of rapport with anyone. His responses are entirely visceral, not cerebral; his intelligence is a mere tool in the services of his drives and needs; he is incapable of mental passion, mental interaction; he can't relate to anything other than his own physical sensations. He is a half-dead, unresponsive lump, incapable of giving or receiving pleasure or happiness; consequently, he is at best an utter bore, an inoffensive blob, since only those capable of absorption in others can be charming. He is trapped in a twilight zone halfway between humans and apes, and is far worse off than the apes because, unlike the apes, he is capable of a large array of negative feelings -- hate, jealousy, contempt, disgust, guilt, shame, doubt -- and moreover, he is aware of what he is and what he isn't.

<TEXT> Here's the thing. You said "Bernie Sanders is a socialist."
Is he in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.
As someone who is a community organizer who studies socialism, I am telling you, specifically, in community organizing, no one calls Bernie Sanders socialist. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.
If you're saying "social democrat" you're referring to the political ideology of reformist socialism, which includes commies from Bernstein to Crosland to Blair.
So your reasoning for calling a Bernie Sanders a socialist is because random people "call liberals socialists?" Let's get Hillary and Warren in there, then, too.
Also, calling someone a democrat or a leftist? It's not one or the other, that's not how progressivism works. They're both. A Bernie Sanders is a Bernie Sanders and a member of the social democrats. But that's not what you said. You said a Bernie Sanders is a socialist, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the social democrats socialists, which means you'd call Croslands, Blairs and other politicians socialists, too. Which you said you don't.
It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?

<TEXT> Criticism is criticism, and everyone is entitled to an opinion. The kid didn't like the movie, and he had some fair points. However, if you want to write a review and post it online, you have to reread it, because people will look for every error in your article that they can find. Did you notice that you told us that there are 3 best scenes? "The very first scene is the best scene." "...they fall into a building and their body weight makes it all fall down. That was the best scene. Except the part where all the superheroes try to pick up Thor's hammer but it's too heavy." On another note, to all the idiots who keep saying it's bad parenting to let a 9 year old see a PG-13 movie, shut up. The first time I saw a PG-13 movie, I was six. The line immediately under PG-13 reads "Parents Strongly Cautioned." My parents were strongly cautioned, they watched the movie first, talked about it, and then they decided that they'd let me see it. It was the first Spider-Man movie, and I watched it with my dad. I remembered about 5 of the coolest lines, I remembered some of the coolest fight scenes, and I remember that a couple people died but I didn't remember how. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE MOVIE! And that was okay for me, because I saw Spider-Man! It was his parents' prerogative to let this particular kid see this particular movie. Stop trying to discredit his opinion by saying he wasn't old enough to see it. I will say that the kid appears to not have been able to grasp most of the plot, but that doesn't mean that his entire opinion is discredited. I'll watch movies from my childhood years later and get a better understanding. Nothing wrong with that. Last thing. Kid, I'm not sure if you actually went to Rotten Tomatoes or not, but don't quote a website if you don't know how it works. The RT score is a ratio of good reviews to total reviews. A single critic can't change that score by more than a point (assuming the film has over 100 reviews, which this one does). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Criticism is criticism, and everyone is entitled to an opinion. The kid didn't like the movie, and he had some fair points. However, if you want to write a review and post it online, you have to reread it, because people will look for every error in your article that they can find. Did you notice that you told us that there are 3 best scenes? "The very first scene is the best scene." "...they fall into a building and their body weight makes it all fall down. That was the best scene. Except the part where all the superheroes try to pick up Thor's hammer but it's too heavy." On another note, to all the idiots who keep saying it's bad parenting to let a 9 year old see a PG-13 movie, shut up. The first time I saw a PG-13 movie, I was six. The line immediately under PG-13 reads "Parents Strongly Cautioned." My parents were strongly cautioned, they watched the movie first, talked about it, and then they decided that they'd let me see it. It was the first Spider-Man movie, and I watched it with my dad. I remembered about 5 of the coolest lines, I remembered some of the coolest fight scenes, and I remember that a couple people died but I didn't remember how. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE MOVIE! And that was okay for me, because I saw Spider-Man! It was his parents' prerogative to let this particular kid see this particular movie. Stop trying to discredit his opinion by saying he wasn't old enough to see it. I will say that the kid appears to not have been able to grasp most of the plot, but that doesn't mean that his entire opinion is discredited. I'll watch movies from my childhood years later and get a better understanding. Nothing wrong with that. Last thing. Kid, I'm not sure if you actually went to Rotten Tomatoes or not, but don't quote a website if you don't know how it works. The RT score is a ratio of good reviews to total reviews. A single critic can't change that score by more than a point (assuming the film has over 100 reviews, which this one does).

<TEXT> Y'know, after reading all these Age of Ultron reviews where non-fans complained about how insular, incoherent and confusing the film was, it's starting to seem like the deeper we go into these films the more exclusionary they are going to become to normal fans. 

The inclusion of deep cut Marvel characters like Ulysses Klaw, Ultron, or The Vision just confuses these people. To them these characters seem really undeveloped or shallow, but to fans the characters have already been very, very meticulously developed, so we don't really need all that much exposition to make sense of it. Almost as if the films were made specifically for us.

When the film says "Ultron is going to Wakanda to get vibranium by way of Ulysses Klaw." The normie says to himself, "What? Who? I have no idea what any of those things are or why Ultron is doing that." While the fan says, "Yeah, if Ultron wants to create world peace by wiping out all human life, and vibranium is key to his plan, he may want to hit up Klaw, since he's stolen a shitload of the substance over the years. Makes sense."

Eventually we're going to get to the point where the normies just don't care anymore because they're too confused and don't want to do the homework That's going to result in a drop off in the amount of money these films make. There's still plenty of people out there who will go see these films, and I'm sure that will always justify spending two-hundred million dollars on them, so they're always going to be around, but they're going to become a lot more like actual comics. Impenetrable for people who aren't deeply immersed in this universe. 

You know what I say to that? 

GOOD. 

I don't care if normies are into this shit. I don't really want these characters to be massive, ubiquitous pulp culture phenomenons if that means we have to spend an entire film expositing to people who don't know what's going on. 

These films should be made for the fans. People who aren't hostile to the notion of an extended, interconnected film universe that requires a familiarity with what has come before. Let the normies go back to watching sports, or the Bachelor or whatever the fuck the were into before this stuff came along. 

If they're tired of playing with the toys I've been playing with since I was 6, then I'll take them back. No problem.

<TEXT> The "real" reason Circlejerk is the bane of Reddit
Been kind of a silent lurker on reddit for years. Recently though, I have been absolutely baffled. There is this reddit cool-kid train where hating on Circlejerk whenever possible is the hip new hip thing. Now I have seen horrible, horrible subs that reddit silently tolerates. Some literally dedicated towards "gassing" Jews... violence, racism, sexism, pedophilia, necrophilia, you name it. But for some reason... Reddit as a whole has decided the worst possible subreddit is the one criticizing first world gluttons with no self control.
The obvious answer is that the average redditor is a fatty, and our message hits close to home (which is true). But I think it goes beyond that. The stereotypical racist/sexist/pervert is very easy to disregard as some obscure toothless creep living in a hovel in a random dark corner of society. But we are just regular people. We are paramedics, firefighters, cops, lawyers, nurses, doctors, teachers, soldiers. We have science, medicine and facts supporting our arguments. They can't just dismiss us as ignorant hicks in some obscure circle, and they hate that.
The numbers don't lie, Circlejerk is growing at a rapid rate. The average person doesn't have to tolerate obese, lazy, entitled people. And they shouldn't. Get used to it reddit fats, because all your whining does is reinforce everything we already knew.

<TEXT> Ayyyyyy LMAO
Cmo est todo el mundo? Esto es increble!
Hay algo que me olvid de decirte todo este tiempo ("privilegio ejecutivo", pero bueno estoy desclasificacin de un montn de cosas en estos das). Volver en la poca de la debacle de / r / creepshots, escrib a / u / spez consejo. Yo lo haba conocido poco despus de que haba tomado el trabajo, y lo encontrado para ser un gran tipo. De vuelta en el da en reddit era pequea, las reas que l supervis eran la ingeniera, el producto y los aspectos del negocio - Esas son las mismas cosas que tienden a centrarse en en una empresa (cada CEO tiene ciertas reas de inters natural, y contrata a otros para supervisar el resto). Como resultado, hemos sido capaces de conectar muy bien y tienen un montn de grandes conversaciones - hablar con l fue muy valiosa.
Bueno, cuando las cosas se calientan alrededor de la r / cosa / creepshots y la gente estaba pidiendo su prohibicin, le escrib para pedir consejo. La cosa muy interesante que escribi fue "cuando yo estaba corriendo cosas, si haba algo racista, sexista, homfobo o que me prohibira de inmediato. No creo que hay un lugar para este tipo de cosas en reddit. Por supuesto , ahora que reddit es mucho ms grande, entiendo si tal vez las cosas son diferentes ".
Siempre he recordado que el correo electrnico cuando le la publicacin ocasional aqu donde la gente dice "los fundadores de reddit pretenden que trata de un lugar para la libertad de expresin." Las mentes humanas aman originalismo, por ejemplo, "Estamos en problemas, por lo que seguramente si nos remontamos a las intenciones originales, podemos hacer las cosas de nuevo bien." Lamento decirte chicos, pero no, eso no era su intencin en absoluto nunca. Chupa para ser usted, / r / coontown - Espero que disfruten voat!
La poltica de la libertad de expresin era algo Formalic porque pareca que el curso ms sabio en el momento. Vale la pena que indica que en esa poca, estbamos hablando acerca de si estaba bien para la gente a publicar imgenes espeluznantes de las mujeres tomadas legalmente en pblico. Eso es una mierda, pero es muy lejos de los extremos de odio que algunas partes del anfitrin sitio hoy. Pareca que permiten enredaderas publicar (annima) fotos de mujeres tomadas en pblico, en un tiempo relativamente pequea subreddit que nunca apareci en la primera plana, era un pequeo precio a pagar por lo que es claro que estbamos en un lugar acogedor de todas las opiniones y el discurso.
Despus de haber tomado esa decisin - la mayor parte de la condicin actual de reddit est en m. Yo no preveo lo que (algunos) redditors decidiran que ver con la libertad. reddit se ha convertido en mucho ms grande - s, mucho mejor - Y mucho peor. Tengo que asumir la responsabilidad.
Pero ... la ms deliciosa parte de esto es que al menos en dos ocasiones distintas, la junta presionado / u / ekjp prohibir de plano TODAS las subreddits de odio en una purga de barrido. Ella se resisti, a sabiendas de la comunidad, alegando que sera una shitshow. Ellen no es un "mal, manipuladora, fuera de contacto incompetente diablesa" como se representa a menudo. Ella fue aprobado por la junta directiva y recomendado por m, porque cuando me fui, ella era la nica ejecutivo de tecnologa en cualquier lugar al que tena las chuletas y la experiencia para gestionar una nueva empresa de este tamao, y que entenda lo reddit trataba. Como podemos ver en su actividad despus de la renuncia, que sabe perfectamente cmo encaja con la comunidad reddit y es una persona normal, divertido - al igual que en la vida real - ella simplemente no le cay en reddit todo el da porque era ocupada con su trabajo del da.
Ellen era ms o menos inclinados a continuar la defensa de mis polticas de libertad de expresin. / R / fatpeoplehate fue prohibido por incitar fuera de las instalaciones de acoso, no discutir grasa vergenza. Lo que todos los blancos potencia neckbeards racista sexistas no entienden es que con ella al frente de la compaa, la empresa sera inmune a las acusaciones de promover el sexismo y el racismo: es, literalmente, # 1 feminista hroe de Silicon Valley, por lo que cualquier "SJWs" tendra dificultades para atacar a la empresa para crear intencionalmente un bastin (je) de contenido sexista / racista. Probablemente habra tolerado su existencia, siempre y cuando usted no caus ningn problema - S que sus estrategias a largo plazo deban encontrar la manera de surgir y dar a conocer las buenas partes de reddit - que permite que existan las partes malas, pero mantenindolos fuera de la centro de atencin. Hubiera sido muy de principios - el director general de reddit, que una vez demand a su empleador anterior para la discriminacin sexual, defiende la libertad de expresin y tolera el lado feo de la humanidad, porque es muy importante para mantener una plataforma para el discurso libre. Hubiera sido inexpugnable.
Bueno, ahora se ha ido (lo hiciste Reddit!), Y / u / spez tiene la autoridad moral como un co-fundador de seguir adelante con la purga. Tratamos de dejar gobiernas a s mismos y que fallamos, por lo que ahora el hombre va a establecer algunas reglas. Es cierto, no puedo decir que estoy terriblemente molesto.

<TEXT> Hola, el tiempo Sombrero serio.
1 / S, soy un troll. Yo era un troll en la escuela secundaria en BBSes, en la universidad en los tablones de anuncios de CMU, me encontr con un foro que fue ms o menos mis amigos curricn entre s, etc. Hago bastante buena imitacin de un ejecutivo de tecnologa profesional cuando lo necesito, sin duda lo suficientemente bien como para entender por qu algo como por ejemplo, el evento dehrmann vera muy poco profesional, pero esa situacin slo tena algunos factores realmente extraos en ella. Y en realidad, no se puede posiblemente ejecutar un sitio como este, sin ser fundamentalmente un troll y entender el trolling. Cuando se anunci que yo era el director general, la reaccin de cada amigo que saba que me estaba uniformemente carcajadas.
Antes de venir a trabajar para reddit, ya sabes lo que he usado mi cuenta? Hacer comentarios trolls / inteligentes para el karma. Usted probablemente puede encontrarlos si se desplaza camino de regreso a antes de 2012. Es agradable ser capaz de volver a ser un usuario normal reddit (yo no poda publicar bajo mi nombre mucho mientras Ellen era CEO porque pareca que lo hara causar demasiada interferencia), aunque tal vez voy a utilizar un alt para atraer menos atencin.
2 / No te preocupes por mi carrera. No tengo planes para trabajar en la industria de la tecnologa de nuevo; Creo que es hora de hacer algo ms, probablemente algo que no implica tener un trabajo asalariado. Tengo un buen dinero ahorrado de mi tiempo en Facebook para poder hacer esto, as que soy muy afortunado. Es cierto que no hice mucho de correr reddit, pero deliberadamente tom un salario inferior para reducir el consumo efectivo y por lo que podra dar algunos empleados mal pagados un aumento. Curiosamente, he recibido dos ofertas de trabajo en el ltimo da o dos, a pesar de mi supuesta unhireability. Imagnate.
Tambin, por favor no acechar a mi esposa - ella es una persona muy reservada, introvertida que no le gusta la atencin y es molesto / divertido por la atencin que he recibido / instigado en la prensa ltimamente.
3 / Me gusta spez mucho, y espero que lo consigue. El resto del equipo tambin es muy bueno; Espero que nadie se va. El trabajo es muy, muy duro y est abriendo un nuevo camino - no ha habido una comunidad (al estilo de foro) de este tamao en el Internet nunca, y los desafos de la gestin de los an mucho ms pequeos han sido bien documentada . Ahora entiendo por qu los presidentes y ex presidentes pasar el rato juntos y esas cosas, a pesar de sus diferencias polticas supuestos (y spez y me parece que tienen un poco justo en comn, incluso).
No parece que estaba equivocado acerca de / r / coontown especficamente (puedo predecir cosas direccionalmente pero todava estoy en el exterior como todos ustedes), pero estoy contento de ver que reddit est tratando primero un mtodo de marginar a la negativa subreddits. No creo que lugares como / r / BDSMCommunity tienen nada de qu preocuparse. Estoy seguro de que habr un montn de ida y vuelta en las polticas, que es necesaria para averiguar lo que funciona.

<TEXT> The other day, my landlord was in my apartment to change out the furnace filter. They called me at work to tell me that my co2 detector was out of battery and that it's very important to make sure that the batteries are changed regularly etc etc. I understood the severity of the situation, but I said, "Oh, that little thing plugged into the wall, behind the treadmill?" to which they replied, "umm...yes...?" and I said, "Oh yeah, I try not to look over there because first thing I see is the treadmill, and then I see the dust on the treadmill, which just conjures up the shame of being fat and out of shape...so I pretty much avoid thinking about anything that is over there."
Now, at this point, the landlord could have done one of two things. They could have taken me completely seriously, and chastised me on the importance of this. as I could be dead... because, yes, it is technically a serious life or death issue. However, the landlord laughed and said, "If you don't have life insurance, I can certainly sign you up! Hell, I'll even fill out the beneficiary part for you!"
Being offended and chastising someone for finding a way to digest and internalize the morbidity of life accomplishes nothing. Making light of morbid situations appears in countless media through the ages, and it crosses international, racial and ethnic boundaries. We see it throughout thousands of years of literature, in writings from the most exalted authors and works, many of which are still taught in our schools.
To say that Shakespeare should be banned because he occasionally made light of death and murder, for example, tacitly denies the way that we, as a whole, have always processed these sorts of issues. People inherently need to hear this and feel a need to share and relate these feelings with others in order to feel okay about it.
Other people see this as disgusting because the way they learned to process it was merely different. Many of the offended indignant have grown up in settings where these issues were internalized and processed within their families by sharing and expressing a hyperbolic sense of seriousness with others, relating to each other by talking about how serious it is, and making themselves feel safe and secure about it by citing and mutually exalting their moral platitudes, because the only way that they have been able to feel okay about these things is by filling themselves with a rigid seriousness about it. They often adopt this hyperbolic seriousness from their upbringing as that is how they were modeled and taught to share it with others in order to process it. So the thing they wish to share is this seriousness. The problem they don't realize is that there are multiple ways to process these things even if they don't have any personal experience with facilitating the feelings in a humorous way. Making sure that everyone else is taking it with the same perspective is the only way to push and promote the personal sense of security, because if everyone else isn't being serious, then we're not internalizing it properly, are we? enter chaos, anarchy, lawlessness, slippery slope blah blah blah
This is their perspective: (expressed by someone who has spent a good amount of time around these types) The idea of processing these things with humor seems foolish, useless and counterproductive. It makes light of a serious issue while accomplishing nothing except embracing a hedonistic ignorance of the real issue. (seriousness being the real issue, not the issue itself)
They don't know how to feel secure by making fun, only by making and promoting standards that are going to 'protect everyone the way they've protected me'.

<TEXT> It's interesting that you mention that because I met Martin Lawrence during the premier of his new film at Cannes, Welcome Home, Roscoe Jenkins, and I was shocked to discover that he in fact did not look like Martin Lawrence. It's a perk of my job that I get to travel to see movies so when I discovered that only one year later after I had already steeped myself in the semiotics of Walt Becker's instant classic Wild Hogs, that he was very different from what he looked like in Wild Hogs. Different skin tones, his goatee was now a full grown beard, when he sweat in the presence of the everyone under the hot French Rivera sun, Mr. Lawrence would run double time up the steps of the theater and make a bee line for the restroom. It was when I cornered him to get him to autograph my copy of Harvey Weinstein's seminal book "101 Things You Didn't Know About the Filming of Wild Hogs" he went completely white, quite literally. Security had ushered me out before I could inquire further, but it looked as if Lawrence since those tragically reported events is now being assumed by the man who started it all, Mr. Walt Becker. I shan't not tell more because I fear for my lively hood here in Hollywood.

<TEXT> In that same piece I noticed that everyone being interviewed declined to mention Martin Lawrence's name. I did some digging, and found an old newspaper clipping at my local library about three hooded individuals dumping the body of a man into the river downtown. By cross referencing the height of the men in the photo to iMDB records, I determined the men to be John Travolta, Ray Liotta, and Walt Becker himself. It seems they got in a heated disagreement with Lawrence over the proper way to cook the Hogs after the production of Wild Hogs was finished. Lawrence wanted medium rare but the rest were all hankering for well done. They killed him, and ate the hogs after vowing never to speak of what happened. I obtained this information at great risk to a bus boy from Belize, so be careful who you tell.

<TEXT> Here's the thing. You said a "melt is a grilled." Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a scientist who studies grilled cheese, I am telling you, specifically, in grilling, no one calls melts grilled cheese. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying "grilled cheese family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Meltidae, which includes things from cheesesteaks to hoagies to pizzas. So your reasoning for calling a melt a grilled cheese is because random people "call the melty ones grilled cheese?" Let's get chicken parmesan and hamburgers in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a grain or a bread? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A melt is a melt and a member of the grilled cheese family. But that's not what you said. You said a melt is a grilled cheese, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the grilled cheese family grilled cheese, which means you'd call hoagies, pizzas, and other melty things grilled cheese, too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?

<TEXT> If that's not the sign of a true piece of art, I don't know what is.
I like to think I'm a pretty good dad to my 2 little girls, but as other parents probably know, it's easy to lose perspective during the day-to-day of bedtimes, baths, tantrums and picky eating.
But after seeing the film, all I wanted to do was go home, wake them up and give them a hug (I let them finish their long nap).
Three days later, I'm still carrying the film around in my head. And it's impacting my interactions with my kids. No more distractions. No more "hurry up and get them to bed so I can watch football." I'm treasuring every moment with them. What other movie, about SPACE, no less, has that sort of impact?
Now if I can only figure out how to manipulate gravity to send morse code to my daughter's LCD Frozen watch....

<TEXT> Another Asian guy here: let me dissect the pass white supremacists seem to give us...

Don't believe it for a second. They use the successes of Asian-Americans only as a club to bash other races with, and to get them to resent us instead of them. White supremacists will often rate Asian people as smarter than Whites, but that is just because it looks completely self-serving in whatever racial "ranking" system they decide to conjure to always put themselves at the top of it.

In reality, white racists have hated us from the jump. They allowed a certain number of us to immigrate because we were cheaper labor than blacks, and when it looked like too many of us were coming over, they restricted our immigration so only a token number of us could ever take hold. 

Asians were always at a numerical disadvantage, which is why we had to keep our heads down and take their shit instead of fighting back. We were the original racialized druggie stereotype. Your black kid in a hoodie slanging crack in the 19th century was a Chinaman with his opium pipe. They put Japanese in concentration camps in WWII to steal their farm land. And because we managed to survive their game, they want to grant us honorary cracker status?

I've no problem with white people, but white racists can all go to hell. Chinese, Japanese, look at these dirty knees? Everytime you racists said that to me, I wanted to take my knee to your face until it was bone-splintered pulp and I'll slit your throats the moment I catch you slipping. Keep that in mind whenever you think I'm a model minority.

<TEXT> Flippity floppity go her labia minora as Kathy Ireland runs from the big hard rapist. It, the fli-fluh, was happening her labia majora were ineffectual in preventing.

But on this rapish night, her inspiringly long vaginal lips, which had on so many occasions caused her grief and visits to the ground via tripping, was to be an advantage.

Flip flap, flip flap, she runs. And the rape man follows. Kate, who, in her state if panicked confusion, at that very moment decided she would begin (surviving this of course) the paperwork necessary to finally change her name to how she'd always wanted it, "Mommy Longlips", turned to take a great good gander at her pursuer. She saw him bouldering towards her, big and black in the night. It's when she saw the wart on his junk, gleaming by the headlights of the cars who would pass by and honk and speed away, that she really, I mean REALLY, got to running.

Flip flap flip flap, flofloflofloflo, uh oh, what's this? her lips are - no - they're acting as a set of wings! Look! Hark! There she goes! Propelled away by the beefy things that caused her to become a target for the mad rapist now shaking his fist powerlessly at the sky where she flies in the first place.

Where will she go? To what extent, exactly, does she have control over her newfound, and glorious, brown-winged mode of transport? She shifts her weight to the side, as on a motorcycle, but the flofloflo won't let her budge. She cocks a leg, as a dog to pee on a hydrant, and: success! she turns, motating amazingly to her will. She does a 180 to look back at her rapist-hopefull. He is a speck, a wart on the sidewalk. She is gone. To fly toward Voyager 1 to recover that golden record and to hawk it at a pawn shop for the sweet sweet green.

<TEXT> Just because it's popular here doesn't mean it's popular where it matters. This movie is an underrated masterpiece that flew over people's heads because it wasn't as straightforward as, say, Avatar. This is a true modern art film, only comparable to maybe Interstellar and Mad Max (another 2 movies that are very unappreciated by the Kevin James/Melissa McCarthey masses). It was so refreshing to watch an actual mature film for mature audiences,  but I guess good R-rated movies are not for everyone.


I think Karl Urban's performance comfortably fits among the best ever, alongside Ledger's The Joker and Jake Gyllenhal in Nightcrawler. It's just a very raw and dark performance that really resonates with the current state of cinema where snappy happy-go-lucky acting is so celebrated.


You wouldn't be criticizing Dredd if you were a true cinephile, so I advise everyone to dive into the vast sea of artistic and obscure films, and not just what the mainstream media spoonfeeds to you. For every film like Spy, Grown Ups, and Prometheus, there's a masterpiece waiting to be discovered, true film like John Wick, The Raid 2, and of course, Dredd. Open yourself to true cinema, you might be surprised what you find in the vast cinematic vault.

<TEXT> Seems like if you hate feminists talking about the internet so much you should just stop going on the Internet. Frankly, if you go on the internet it's *kind of* entirely your fault and no one else's if you get outraged by SJWs. Like, honestly, how obvious is that? Once you go on the Internet, you got no one to blame but yourself if you overhear someone saying that objectifying women should be discouraged or that black people don't think jokes about them stealing bikes are funny. Turn off the computer. Ignore it. Don't go on twitter or Reddit or Tumblr or anywhere, really. 

Look, Feminists are going to use the Internet. And they are going to talk about it. If you overhear one talking about how saying you're going to "rape" someone is terrible, and that makes you feel raincloud that's *your* fault. You went on twitter. You had to know some woman was going to ask for more minorities to be protagonists in video games. You can't blame Anita, buddy, and you've got no right to complain.

Wearing that fedora and those cargo shorts, Cheetos on your breath. You wanted to get upset and faux offended about nothing. You were asking for it, *begging* to be called a neckbearded brogressive, a short sighted, white male teenager. You go on the internet, you get feministed. 100% your fault.

<TEXT> Yeah, and I smell a comeback to past sensibilities in cinema that feels like a breath of fresh air. No more post-modern deconstruction and self-aware reinvention, no more ironic referencing of the past, just straight up followings of the rules of art.

There's a grandeur that comes from simply playing it straight (shown here in the camera work, the choice of the shots, the editing, the music) that faded over the decades by excess and desire of reinvention. A technique that is mastered but self-erases leaves place to the spectacle, it doesn't exist simply trying to show off how original and ground breaking the director is and let the stuff speak for itself, it is more immersive than gimmicks. Here, there's no excessive underlining and trying to make it more and more impactful to a more and more desensitized audience by forcing fancy camera tricks that more often removes you out of the experience than anything else.

We need to go back there, re-sensitize ourselves to older, more subtle and ''sage'' esthetics, because the path we've taken is a debilitating dead-end. Movies shouldn't over-stimulate you to the point of killing your sensitivity, it should exercise that sensitivity, and a Big scale underrated gem movie is no reason to go against that. It's no easy feat to balance such movies. I didn't see much footage of Avatar, I don't know if it succeeded, but from this and another trailer I've seen, there might be a chance.

I'm saying this here, but I trullly feel like we're slowly going back to some great cinema. I won't get hyped for the movie, but it caught my attention for sure.

<TEXT> If we ban pics of girls we should just do a sitewide ban of guy pics as well. We can't have feminists fingerbanging to underage boys.

In fact, let's just ban ANY pic just to be on the safe side.

This is really just a censorship issue. There's porn of all kinds on every single site out there. There's BARELY LEGAL TEEN porn which is extremely popular. Hell, even Brooke Shields and Traci Lords put underage porn into MAINSTREAM MOVIES.
Sure we shouldn't be sexualizing naked children, but if you're going to start banning legal content just for the sake of hoping to catch illegal content, how is that any different than an officer firing into the crowd of a fleeing robber with a shotgun just to make sure he gets the bad guy?

Do just like any other site: do your DUE DILIGENCE to remove any illegal content just as any site would. But it's definitely not your responsibility to police ALL content. That's just impossible. Even 4chan is notorious for DAILY KIDDIE PORN PICS. but the mods remove them as soon as they can because they CAN'T be held accountable for other people's posts otherwise reddit would likewise be held liable for ANY instance of an illegal pic.

Even Iggy Azalea made a child porn video where she tried to seduce an underage little boy with her pussy. That was allowed on YOUTUBE. So let's not get ahead of ourselves here. It's really not about the images themselves as much as the gatekeepers in charge of SEXUALIZING THE CONTEXT according to their feminist agenda.

I've seen pics on reddit of parents and strangers posting pics of naked kids playing in a bathtub or near the shower. If ALL naked children are to be removed, those would fall under 'illegal'.

If something is sexualizing a child in an obvious manner, we can remove it, no problem. But if someone is using their feminist liberal agenda to say "THAT is sexual TO ME" then we should tell them to fuck off. I mean social justice warriors support and still buy Lena Dunham's book where she admits to MOLESTING HER LITTLE SISTER. Except it's not considered molestation because the Social Justice Warriors are in charge of setting the context. Instead of Lena Dunham the CHILD MOLESTER touching her sister's vagina, it's warped into a fun childhood game of innocent curiosity. Again, it all depends on the gatekeepers interpretation of events.

Our goal should be to stand against censorship, not give it an excuse to GROW.

<TEXT> Without meaning to sound condescending, I really think you should endeavour to excavate a little deeper into the mineshaft of cinema. Dumb action-flicks and superhero films are the common metals near the top of the mineshaft. They're completely accessible: everybody 'gets' them. You don't have to do much work to get the shallow sort of no-frills 'entertainment' they provide.


However, something which most teenagers are not yet aware of, is that down there in the mineshaft is a wealth of precious gems so beautiful and so thought-provoking that if you experienced them, you would never want to go back to the rather common and mundane stuff on the surface. Down there are films that can make you cry and leave you in a state of heightened emotion for days. Down there are films that can change your perspective of how you view your own life, or how you view other people. Down there are films that will worm their way into your brain and start to become a part of your identity.

But you can't just leap down the mineshaft. If your diet consists of Transformers, Harry Potters and Avengers, you will break your neck if you try to dive straight for the Blade Runners and the American Beautys. Challenge yourself to dig downwards. Watch films from as many different genres, time-periods and cultures as you can. Try to inch away from your comfort zone. 

Again: please don't think me as being condescending. This isn't an intelligence thing. People who appreciate the "depressing philosophical bullshit" of films like Birdman aren't more intelligent than you. They've just put more time into exploring cinema and adventuring into their own personal mineshaft. I know it seems comfortable at the top, but I can promise you that digging is very, very worth your time.

<TEXT> Holy lack of imagination, Batman!

* Expanded voting rights gave more of a say to individual families with more daughters than sons.
* Expanded rights to enter into legal agreements and hold property made sure that a father's legacy stayed with his blood and wasn't passed down to sons-in-law or brothers he hates.
* Birth control and abortion helped stem the spread of STDs and prevented many unwilling adults from becoming fathers.
* Equal pay and protected class status doubles the pool of potential graduates and employees, making sure that the highest level of achievement, scholarship, and innovation is pushed higher, faster than before.
* Sexual revolutions and relaxed prudishness made women more willing to experiment in bed and more knowledgeable about how to instruct men to please them and how to please men because being sexual and a woman isn't as stigmatized anymore.
* Alimony and child support for both genders has guaranteed single parents income and support for their children, even in hard economic times or when divorce upends personal finances
* Dismantling the homemaker / docile wife institution has increased the GDP of the country
* It struck down a law that lowered the drinking age for women, but not men, because they were "less responsible" (Craig v. Boren)
* It asked the FBI to change the definition of rape to include men
* It allows new masculinities to flourish with less social backlash. Men can be gentler, more fashionable, more feminine, and more sensitive without being as stigmatized for having a rich emotional life as they used to.
* FMLA gives men time off work as well.
* Opening the armed services to women, and eventually opening the front lines, helped the burden of war not fall entirely on men.
* Working women help men stay home and raise children, go back to school, and try to start their own businesses without fear of going homeless and broke.
* NOW and women's rights groups have always been participants in hate crime legislation against blacks, gays, and other minorities (many of which are men).
* Pushes towards better representation of women in media have also expanded the roles that men can play.
* Feminists have struck down legislation that discriminated against men in traditionally female fields like nursing and teaching

Now, if MRAs can say that the MRM has done half of that for men, let alone *women*, I'd eat my own shoe.

No te preocupes, cucks. Seguiremos siendo alrededor. Estamos en todas partes. Somos su familia, sus vecinos, sus compaeros de trabajo. Estamos con usted cada vez que utilice el GPS para evitar un barrio "malo". Estamos con usted cuando usted hace que la decisin de no comprar en "ese lugar" a causa de "esas personas". Estamos con usted cuando usted hace que la decisin de comprar una casa en un barrio blanco, porque "las escuelas son tan buenas."
Usted puede hacer excusas para ti mismo, pero ya sabemos la verdad. Ya eres racista. Usted sabe que, inconscientemente. Usted simplemente no va a admitir a ti mismo. A tomar decisiones todos los das para evitar que los negros. Cuando usted hace compras. 

Quin te la fecha. Donde trabajas. Donde ir a socializar. El modo de sostener su sonrisa tensa y pretender que no se dan cuenta cuando alguna mami permite a sus polluelos a funcionar salvaje en la tienda o restaurante. Cmo evitas grupos de "jvenes". Usted ya segregar a s mismo de ellos, y lo sabes. 

Eres ... como yo.

<TEXT> Bud, you have no clue what you're talking about. You haven't read *Why Lift* and therefore haven't the first fucking clue with which ethical/aesthetic criteria Snyder was dismissive of traditional workout conventions. You haven't read *Paleo Me Plenty*. You don't, for example, know another great regimen Snyder dismissed, or why. You aren't making an effort to truly digest or engage in an ongoing dialogue so much as corroding it. But perhaps you're over-rating Snyder as the greatest lifting director of all time. He's just ripped, therefore people think he lifts. Peter Jackson's bulking is just the same as Snyder's lazy 3x5 rep routine.

I could drop so much advanced fitness jargon on you, it would make your head spin, but I won't. Instead, I'll simply point out that you don't know what any of the different modes of dead lifts are, or how they seize upon muscle tissue regeneration. You've never read and don't know who people like Milo of Croton, Galen, or Frederic Delavier are- and those are just the biggies. You've read/seen next to no classic weight training, if any. Certainly not scholastically. You googled some shit about admiring physiques and copy/pasted something written in /r/fitness that you have no basis for understanding. You- yes the dumb, blind, sheltered little product of the exercise industry that you are, contribute to our world's and muscle tissue degradation. (You don't even know what that means because you don't know what good form is). You insult what you're ignorant about. And that's a really shitty thing to do. I suggest you take an honest personal inventory, and then try to make something better of yourself. Because right now, you're pretty fucking disgusting to read. Honestly, I think you should be ashamed of yourself, and should consider apologizing to this thread.

Querido Hijo Varn Cojida,

Siento que ya no soy 16. de hecho he crecido, mis testculos han descendido, y mientras lo hago pasar una gran cantidad de tiempo en Internet - de hecho, mi trabajo es la construccin y reparacin de aplicaciones web - probablemente los es posible que haya utilizado, yo crezco cansado de mierda de internet.

Me alegro de que hayas encontrado 4chan y Reddit, pero saba usted, hay aproximadamente 180 millones de sitios web, ms o menos? La mayora de ellos lo hacen cosas como ropa y prestamos de noticias, o un blog acerca de su gato. O porno. Hay un montn de porno. Usted se sorprendera de que los memes desu, n **** r chistes y brosites MRA son jodidamente pequea porcin de la internet. No 0,1 por ciento. Ni siquiera cerca.

As que cuando me hablas acerca de la "Internet real" - Construyo la verdadera internet. Corro cables de red, servidores en rack, analizar los malos errores de espacio de nombres, corregir 500s, reconstruir matrices RAID, y hacer la mierda que hace la verdadera mierda internet - donde las personas se comportan como lo hacen en la vida real.

Su anonimato no te hace fuerte. Te hace mierda dbil. Usted ha decidido sus instintos ms bajos pertenecen en Internet en lugar de su humanidad, y permites que la gente como Ellen Pao y Anita Sarkeesian a tomar la cada para usted. No teme la prdida de la libertad de expresin - temes el requisito de ser un puto persona real en Internet. Tener que escuchar a su oposicin, tratarlos con decencia humana bsica y la compasin y posiblemente cambiar su mente de mierda.

Tienes miedo de rendicin de cuentas. Soy dueo de toda palabra que he dicho aqu, incluso las palabras me he lamentado profundamente. Soy fcil de alcanzar y mi verdadero nombre ha sido dado a conocer en varias ocasiones. Soy amigo de varios usuarios aqu. Mi Twitter y Google+ describen ambas mi verdadero nombre, y la mayora de la gente aqu sabe donde trabajo. Si lo desea, con mucho gusto comparto.

T, que utilizara sin irona un trmino como hugbox, est ocupado furiosa por la prdida de su cuenta. Usted necesita los chans, porque no poda soportar conmigo de hombre a hombre. Usted tiene que publicar "Lol U Mad Bro" memes, porque usted no est lo suficientemente maduro para aceptar las crticas constructivas con voz severa.

El resto de la Internet est creciendo de una puta vez. Twitter y Facebook estn difundiendo noticias y ayudar a combatientes de la libertad buscan la democracia. Tambin eran un medio para permitir que el odio se propague, pero estn trabajando para arreglar eso.

Honestamente, tengo una nueva relacin, un nuevo apartamento que todava necesita un poco de retoque, un trabajo a tiempo completo, y una variedad de actividades recreativas y los compromisos familiares. Tiempo de mierda Internet no est en esa lista. Mis notificaciones telefnicas son una parte integral de mi existencia - no puedo elegir para apagarlos durante tres horas. Conseguir brigaded no me hace llorar, o daar mi autoestima uno puto pice. Es un desperdicio de mi tiempo de mierda sin embargo, y por extrao que, cuando te haces mayor, empiezas a tratarlo ms como el precioso recurso que es, y llorar el tiempo cuando era ms joven que se desperdicia en cosas como una mierda internet.

Ningn adulto vale su sal nunca va a decir - "Me gustara reprim ms homosexuales y las mujeres y los gorditos de / b / cuando era ms joven."

Yo tambin estoy recibiendo hasta el punto en que podra querer tener un hijo, y si ella es una hija, quiero que ella sea capaz de vivir su vida libre de desprecio basado nicamente en el hecho de que ella tiene un par de tetas y que 're capaz de evitar mi retribucin de los padres. Me preocupa qu tipo de internet que estamos dejando atrs, pero lo ms importante, qu clase de gente que estamos dejando atrs. No quiero que mi hija rodeada de gente patticos como usted - la gente que no puede manejar lo ms mnimo de la consternacin sin la construccin de un muro de anonimato y snarking o calumniar en la oscuridad. No temo a su actitud, me temo que su cobarda generalizada, y el barniz pseudo-intelectual que pendejos puse sobre ella - con chorradas como Agenda de Derechos de los Hombres, y Redpilling y igualitarismo y anti-SJW y estos obsesivo puto Gates. Puede haber personas reales con buenas ideas en cada uno de esos grupos, pero usted puede estar seguro como la mierda no es uno de ellos.

As que ahora, se llega a ver la verdadera Internet - lleno de comentarios y el comercio, el discurso y la informacin, la rendicin de cuentas y responsabilidad. Usted puede venir a lo largo de la cogida, o puede ejecutar de nuevo a su hugbox, pero no me eches la culpa cuando el mundo cambia a su alrededor.

Atentamente,

de pollo sin grasa, Adulto.

<TEXT> So, here's the thing:

When you go to any sort of "I have a problem" support group, inevitably up comes the question: "How did you know you had a problem?"

Lots of people I've worked with never knew they had a problem until something weird brought it up. They almost never listen to their friends or loved ones or professionals or anything. they listen to little kids pointing out their drinking, or a random dog growling at them because they're getting so angry, or, famously, Robert Downy Jr eating a shitty burger king burger and realizing how low his life had gotten.

Point is, when it comes to people getting help, most of them end up getting that final kick from left field. They're so used to filtering out the normal nagging voices that it takes an outside force often to make them aware. The whole thing about a frog in its own slowly boiling water.

I don't think 99% of the folk I've talked to on the Internet have listened to my advice, but maybe one of them did. Or just thought about it.  But I've met enough people in treatment centers that have stories of random "truths" from strangers that I don't shy away from it anymore.

Recuerdo refrescante / b / toda la tarde con la esperanza de que alguien podra hacer un nuevo meme. Yo era un Memer atrs cuando El perro del consejo era el nico y todava upvote cada meme perro del consejo que veo porque de la fiebre del amo de la nostalgia que me trae. Hoy en da, hay muchos miles de quickmeme y otros sitios web de meme. Yo era un Memer volver antes de la creacin memegenerator (el primer sitio web meme) y tuve que hacerlos con MS Powerpoint o Paint. Hablando de sitios web meme, yo fui uno de los primeros peticionarios para memebase.com y todava tienen una de las principales cuentas de all a pesar de haber emigrado a reddit Hace casi 2 aos. Estaba en 4chan y memebase donde me cort mis dientes crear memes, mucho antes de que tena una cuenta de reddit y forma antes de / r / adviceanimals [1] fue creado a finales de 2010. Volver antes de que pudiera conseguir cualquier tipo de puntos o incluso username reconocimiento , yo estaba creando memes como una forma inteligente y de fcil digestin para reflexionar sobre la sociedad, relatar alguna historia a mi pblico, o simplemente ser divertido. Recuerdas rica cuervo? No? Hago. Es probable que no recuerde perro depresin, loco novia mantis religiosa, pug introspectiva o friendzone Johnny tampoco. Recuerdo a todos ellos. De hecho, slo ha presentado dos puestos a adviceanimals cosechando un total de slo 4 puntos y no ha comentado Hay alguna vez recientemente. As que por favor, respeto a mi juicio con respecto a la direccin de la subreddit y la integridad de los mensajes que he celebrado caro a mi corazn por casi 7 aos, pero usted no tiene fuertes sentimientos por. Gracias.

<TEXT> Djame incondicional esto diciendo que yo he sido un Memer ya que primero aparecieron en 4chan (circa hace siglos en el tiempo a Internet) 2006. Recuerdo refrescante / b / toda la tarde con la esperanza de que alguien podra hacer un nuevo meme. Yo era un Memer atrs cuando El perro del consejo era el nico y todava upvote cada meme perro del consejo que veo porque de la fiebre del amo de la nostalgia que me trae. Hoy en da, hay muchos miles de quickmeme y otros sitios web de meme. Yo era un Memer volver antes de la creacin memegenerator (el primer sitio web meme) y tuve que hacerlos con MS Powerpoint o Paint. Hablando de sitios web meme, yo fui uno de los primeros peticionarios para memebase.com y todava tienen una de las principales cuentas de all a pesar de haber emigrado a reddit Hace casi 2 aos. Estaba en 4chan y memebase donde me cort mis dientes crear memes, mucho antes de que tena una cuenta de reddit y forma antes de / r / adviceanimals [1] fue creado a finales de 2010. Volver antes de que pudiera conseguir cualquier tipo de puntos o incluso username reconocimiento , yo estaba creando memes como una forma inteligente y de fcil digestin para reflexionar sobre la sociedad, relatar alguna historia a mi pblico, o simplemente ser divertido. Recuerdas rica cuervo? No? Hago. Es probable que no recuerde perro depresin, loco novia mantis religiosa, pug introspectiva o friendzone Johnny tampoco. Recuerdo a todos ellos. De hecho, slo ha presentado dos puestos a adviceanimals cosechando un total de slo 4 puntos y no ha comentado Hay alguna vez recientemente.

<TEXT> Flippity floppity go her labia minora as Kathy Ireland runs from the big hard rapist. It, the fli-fluh, was happening her labia majora were ineffectual in preventing.

But on this rapish night, her inspiringly long vaginal lips, which had on so many occasions caused her grief and visits to the ground via tripping, was to be an advantage.

Flip flap, flip flap, she runs. And the rape man follows. Kate, who, in her state if panicked confusion, at that very moment decided she would begin (surviving this of course) the paperwork necessary to finally change her name to how she'd always wanted it, "Mommy Longlips", turned to take a great good gander at her pursuer. She saw him bouldering towards her, big and black in the night. It's when she saw the wart on his junk, gleaming by the headlights of the cars who would pass by and honk and speed away, that she really, I mean REALLY, got to running.

Flip flap flip flap, flofloflofloflo, uh oh, what's this? her lips are - no - they're acting as a set of wings! Look! Hark! There she goes! Propelled away by the beefy things that caused her to become a target for the mad rapist now shaking his fist powerlessly at the sky where she flies in the first place.

Where will she go? To what extent, exactly, does she have control over her newfound, and glorious, brown-winged mode of transport? She shifts her weight to the side, as on a motorcycle, but the flofloflo won't let her budge. She cocks a leg, as a dog to pee on a hydrant, and: success! she turns, motating amazingly to her will. She does a 180 to look back at her rapist-hopefull. He is a speck, a wart on the sidewalk. She is gone. To fly toward Voyager 1 to recover that golden record and to hawk it at a pawn shop for the sweet sweet green. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My favorite articles are on ArticleCity, it's where these content mill chumps usually used to sell tons of articles to. Here's my favorite called "How to be famous like Justin Bieber."

Do you want to become famous? And do you want to become famous like Justin Bieber did? Well what if I was to tell you that it's not actually that hard to do? 

Bieber may be too criticized by many but is a great example of what the marketing, social networking and other elements can do. 

First Bieber began releasing their videos through YouTube, a platform that has given 5 minutes of fame to many people, but these 5 minutes stretched into years due to other internet tools... Twitter. 

If we learn from the biography of Justin Bieber is that if someone wants to become famous, should begin now to put their videos (as real as possible) on YouTube, because you never know who might "accidentally" discover your talent for delight the young fans. This is exactly what has happened to Justin Bieber. 

Twitter really help Bieber began to attract attention from your target market. Many marketers still do not understand the scope that is Twitter users and yet this was the platform that Justin used to engage with your audience. Justin currently offer your movie called "Never Say Never" (never say never), a type of documentary which presents the story of the singer and how he came to where he is now. 

And of course had to take a perfume especially for girls called "someday" but the video is a little weird and may even get you a laugh, in two days has reached the 2 million views. A very good example is Google; that is starting to become obsessed with the pop stars. This search engine company has made a change in its marketing strategy. Last month, he joined Lady Gaga in an ad to show all the opportunities offered by the Chrome browser. Now he has done the same with Justin Bieber. 

The announcement is similar to Gaga, but also shares some similarities with the recent announcement Dear Sophie, which shows a father using Chrome and other Google products to remember her daughter's childhood. 

It makes sense that Google has thought Bieber for their promotion. The young celebrity was discovered thanks to his performances uploaded to Youtube. And with it, Google manages to reach an important demographic: teenage girls. 

One of his secrets: Its well-defined market. 

Justin Bieber is not intended that all are his fans; he knows it would be almost impossible, yet the market for young girls have it well controlled. So it adds the elements of marketing, good use of digital tools and a well-defined market and the rest is history. </TEXT>

I seriously doubt I'm unusual in this respect; in 20 years time more than a few of us are going to be in positions of serious power and we may see some positive change from that alone. No need to invade anyone, climb the ladder and shit on the degenerates from above. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good morning. In less than an hour, aircraft from here will join others from around the world. And you will be launching the largest aerial battle in this history of mankind.

Mankind -- that word should have new meaning for all of us today.

We can't be consumed by our petty differences anymore.

We will be united in our common interests.



Perhaps its fate that today is the 4th of July, and you will once again be fighting for our freedom, not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution -- but from annihilation.

We're fighting for our right to live, to exist.

And should we win the day, the 4th of July will no longer be known as an American holiday, but as the day when the world declared in one voice:

"We will not go quietly into the night!

We will not vanish without a fight!

We're going to live on!

We're going to survive!"

Today, we celebrate our Independence Day! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Without meaning to sound condescending, I really think you should endeavour to excavate a little deeper into the mineshaft of cinema. Dumb action-flicks and superhero films are the common metals near the top of the mineshaft. They're completely accessible: everybody 'gets' them. You don't have to do much work to get the shallow sort of no-frills 'entertainment' they provide.

However, something which most teenagers are not yet aware of, is that down there in the mineshaft is a wealth of precious gems so beautiful and so thought-provoking that if you experienced them, you would never want to go back to the rather common and mundane stuff on the surface. Down there are films that can make you cry and leave you in a state of heightened emotion for days. Down there are films that can change your perspective of how you view your own life, or how you view other people. Down there are films that will worm their way into your brain and start to become a part of your identity.

But you can't just leap down the mineshaft. If your diet consists of Transformers, Harry Potters and Avengers, you will break your neck if you try to dive straight for the Blade Runners and the American Beautys. Challenge yourself to dig downwards. Watch films from as many different genres, time-periods and cultures as you can. Try to inch away from your comfort zone. 

Again: please don't think me as being condescending. This isn't an intelligence thing. People who appreciate the "depressing philosophical bullshit" of films like Birdman aren't more intelligent than you. They've just put more time into exploring cinema and adventuring into their own personal mineshaft. I know it seems comfortable at the top, but I can promise you that digging is very, *very* worth your time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why should I care who moderates SRD? They're not journalists and they're not really beholden to some sort of major ethical agreement to run their subs according to an original intent from Reddit corporate. All they have a responsibility is to enforce the rules that they set for the sub and make sure it isn't "breaking Reddit," per se. 

Other than that, it's up to you how you want to browse. I don't see the point of going to war over this when the clear solution is anti-brigading tools and more access to Reddit's statistical data on brigading. Reddit ad infinitum. You keep using Reddit and Reddit keeps making money and chugging along. So far only brigading statistical data comes from people who do it themselves.

Considering this is a free market place of ideas, then the market place is working. People are curating the ideas they want and if they don't like ideas somewhere else they create a new branch. 

Why call them cancer? That just seems like crazy talk as well. You have the ability to create any sub you want and curate the content that you want. This seems like such a childish reactionary response. The only reason I can see people calling other moderators cancer is that they want the same audience that those moderators have.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Flippity floppity go her labia minora as Kathy Ireland runs from the big hard rapist. It, the fli-fluh, was happening her labia majora were ineffectual in preventing.

But on this rapish night, her inspiringly long vaginal lips, which had on so many occasions caused her grief and visits to the ground via tripping, was to be an advantage.

Flip flap, flip flap, she runs. And the rape man follows. Kate, who, in her state if panicked confusion, at that very moment decided she would begin (surviving this of course) the paperwork necessary to finally change her name to how she'd always wanted it, "Mommy Longlips", turned to take a great good gander at her pursuer.

Flip flap flip flap, flofloflofloflo, uh oh, what's this? her lips are - no - they're acting as a set of wings! Look! Hark! There she goes! Propelled away by the beefy things that caused her to become a target for the mad rapist now shaking his fist powerlessly at the sky where she flies in the first place.

Where will she go? To what extent, exactly, does she have control over her newfound, and glorious, brown-winged mode of transport?

<TEXT> I'm uncomfortable going into this area because, again, without these anti-brigade tools we're going to be bashing each other over the head with benign Reddit history about "SRS taking over a sub," which is a weird claim anyway. SRD has double the subscribers of SRS and is ten times more active so where does SRS eventually come in? So *all* the people that post there are going to get whipped with the same cream because of general claims of brigading? 

I know that most stuff that gets linked is usually around hot button issues, and the reasons these are linked are because these are usually the issues that attract the most hot headed people, hence the sub is functioning as it's supposed to. However, I don't understand what the function of the sub is supposed to be. The moderators of SRD are already cracking down on shitposting and they also work closely with the admins to ensure that brigading is kept to a minimum. Other than that I'm sensing you have a specific position about this. 

Ultimately, it's up to the moderators to choose how that sub is run and I don't really see the point in arguing about who's community is more conservative and who's more progressive because these are arbitrary to the ultimate use of Reddit which is to curate communities of people who want to talk to each other the way they want, how they want, with the people they want. And Reddit seems to not care about these wars because the goal is to keep you using Reddit. Anything else is arbitrary.  </TEXT>

Querido Hijo Varn Cojida,

Siento que ya no soy 16. de hecho he crecido, mis testculos han descendido, y mientras lo hago pasar una gran cantidad de tiempo en Internet - de hecho, mi trabajo es la construccin y reparacin de aplicaciones web - probablemente los es posible que haya utilizado, yo crezco cansado de mierda de internet.

Me alegro de que hayas encontrado 4chan y Reddit, pero saba usted, hay aproximadamente 180 millones de sitios web, ms o menos? La mayora de ellos lo hacen cosas como ropa y prestamos de noticias, o un blog acerca de su gato. O porno. Hay un montn de porno. Usted se sorprendera de que los memes desu, n **** r chistes y brosites MRA son jodidamente pequea porcin de la internet. No 0,1 por ciento. Ni siquiera cerca.

As que cuando me hablas acerca de la "Internet real" - Construyo la verdadera internet. Corro cables de red, servidores en rack, analizar los malos errores de espacio de nombres, corregir 500s, reconstruir matrices RAID, y hacer la mierda que hace la verdadera mierda internet - donde las personas se comportan como lo hacen en la vida real.

Su anonimato no te hace fuerte. Te hace mierda dbil. Usted ha decidido sus instintos ms bajos pertenecen en Internet en lugar de su humanidad, y permites que la gente como Ellen Pao y Anita Sarkeesian a tomar la cada para usted. No teme la prdida de la libertad de expresin - temes el requisito de ser un puto persona real en Internet. Tener que escuchar a su oposicin, tratarlos con decencia humana bsica y la compasin y posiblemente cambiar su mente de mierda.

Tienes miedo de rendicin de cuentas. Soy dueo de toda palabra que he dicho aqu, incluso las palabras me he lamentado profundamente. Soy fcil de alcanzar y mi verdadero nombre ha sido dado a conocer en varias ocasiones. Soy amigo de varios usuarios aqu. Mi Twitter y Google+ describen ambas mi verdadero nombre, y la mayora de la gente aqu sabe donde trabajo. Si lo desea, con mucho gusto comparto.

T, que utilizara sin irona un trmino como hugbox, est ocupado furiosa por la prdida de su cuenta. Usted necesita los chans, porque no poda soportar conmigo de hombre a hombre. Usted tiene que publicar "Lol U Mad Bro" memes, porque usted no est lo suficientemente maduro para aceptar las crticas constructivas con voz severa.

El resto de la Internet est creciendo de una puta vez. Twitter y Facebook estn difundiendo noticias y ayudar a combatientes de la libertad buscan la democracia. Tambin eran un medio para permitir que el odio se propague, pero estn trabajando para arreglar eso.

Honestamente, tengo una nueva relacin, un nuevo apartamento que todava necesita un poco de retoque, un trabajo a tiempo completo, y una variedad de actividades recreativas y los compromisos familiares. Tiempo de mierda Internet no est en esa lista. Mis notificaciones telefnicas son una parte integral de mi existencia - no puedo elegir para apagarlos durante tres horas. Conseguir brigaded no me hace llorar, o daar mi autoestima uno puto pice. Es un desperdicio de mi tiempo de mierda sin embargo, y por extrao que, cuando te haces mayor, empiezas a tratarlo ms como el precioso recurso que es, y llorar el tiempo cuando era ms joven que se desperdicia en cosas como una mierda internet.

Ningn adulto vale su sal nunca va a decir - "Me gustara reprim ms homosexuales y las mujeres y los gorditos de / b / cuando era ms joven."

Yo tambin estoy recibiendo hasta el punto en que podra querer tener un hijo, y si ella es una hija, quiero que ella sea capaz de vivir su vida libre de desprecio basado nicamente en el hecho de que ella tiene un par de tetas y que 're capaz de evitar mi retribucin de los padres. Me preocupa qu tipo de internet que estamos dejando atrs, pero lo ms importante, qu clase de gente que estamos dejando atrs. No quiero que mi hija rodeada de gente patticos como usted - la gente que no puede manejar lo ms mnimo de la consternacin sin la construccin de un muro de anonimato y snarking o calumniar en la oscuridad. No temo a su actitud, me temo que su cobarda generalizada, y el barniz pseudo-intelectual que pendejos puse sobre ella - con chorradas como Agenda de Derechos de los Hombres, y Redpilling y igualitarismo y anti-SJW y estos obsesivo puto Gates. Puede haber personas reales con buenas ideas en cada uno de esos grupos, pero usted puede estar seguro como la mierda no es uno de ellos.

As que ahora, se llega a ver la verdadera Internet - lleno de comentarios y el comercio, el discurso y la informacin, la rendicin de cuentas y responsabilidad. Usted puede venir a lo largo de la cogida, o puede ejecutar de nuevo a su hugbox, pero no me eches la culpa cuando el mundo cambia a su alrededor.

Atentamente,

Me alegro de que hayas encontrado 4chan y Reddit, pero saba usted, hay aproximadamente 180 millones de sitios web, ms o menos? La mayora de ellos lo hacen cosas como ropa y prestamos de noticias, o un blog acerca de su gato. O porno. Hay un montn de porno. Usted se sorprendera de que los memes desu, n **** r chistes y brosites MRA son jodidamente pequea porcin de la internet. No 0,1 por ciento. Ni siquiera cerca.

As que cuando me hablas acerca de la "Internet real" - Construyo la verdadera internet. Corro cables de red, servidores en rack, analizar los malos errores de espacio de nombres, corregir 500s, reconstruir matrices RAID, y hacer la mierda que hace la verdadera mierda internet - donde las personas se comportan como lo hacen en la vida real.

Su anonimato no te hace fuerte. Te hace mierda dbil. Usted ha decidido sus instintos ms bajos pertenecen en Internet en lugar de su humanidad, y permites que la gente como Ellen Pao y Anita Sarkeesian a tomar la cada para usted. No teme la prdida de la libertad de expresin - temes el requisito de ser un puto persona real en Internet. Tener que escuchar a su oposicin, tratarlos con decencia humana bsica y la compasin y posiblemente cambiar su mente de mierda.

Tienes miedo de rendicin de cuentas. Soy dueo de toda palabra que he dicho aqu, incluso las palabras me he lamentado profundamente. Soy fcil de alcanzar y mi verdadero nombre ha sido dado a conocer en varias ocasiones. Soy amigo de varios usuarios aqu. Mi Twitter y Google+ describen ambas mi verdadero nombre, y la mayora de la gente aqu sabe donde trabajo. Si lo desea, con mucho gusto comparto.

T, que utilizara sin irona un trmino como hugbox, est ocupado furiosa por la prdida de su cuenta. Usted necesita los chans, porque no poda soportar conmigo de hombre a hombre. Usted tiene que publicar "Lol U Mad Bro" memes, porque usted no est lo suficientemente maduro para aceptar las crticas constructivas con voz severa.

El resto de la Internet est creciendo de una puta vez. Twitter y Facebook estn difundiendo noticias y ayudar a combatientes de la libertad buscan la democracia. Tambin eran un medio para permitir que el odio se propague, pero estn trabajando para arreglar eso.

Honestamente, tengo una nueva relacin, un nuevo apartamento que todava necesita un poco de retoque, un trabajo a tiempo completo, y una variedad de actividades recreativas y los compromisos familiares. Tiempo de mierda Internet no est en esa lista. Mis notificaciones telefnicas son una parte integral de mi existencia - no puedo elegir para apagarlos durante tres horas. Conseguir brigaded no me hace llorar, o daar mi autoestima uno puto pice. Es un desperdicio de mi tiempo de mierda sin embargo, y por extrao que, cuando te haces mayor, empiezas a tratarlo ms como el precioso recurso que es, y llorar el tiempo cuando era ms joven que se desperdicia en cosas como una mierda internet.

Ningn adulto vale su sal nunca va a decir - "Me gustara reprim ms homosexuales y las mujeres y los gorditos de / b / cuando era ms joven."

Yo tambin estoy recibiendo hasta el punto en que podra querer tener un hijo, y si ella es una hija, quiero que ella sea capaz de vivir su vida libre de desprecio basado nicamente en el hecho de que ella tiene un par de tetas y que 're capaz de evitar mi retribucin de los padres. Me preocupa qu tipo de internet que estamos dejando atrs, pero lo ms importante, qu clase de gente que estamos dejando atrs. No quiero que mi hija rodeada de gente patticos como usted - la gente que no puede manejar lo ms mnimo de la consternacin sin la construccin de un muro de anonimato y snarking o calumniar en la oscuridad. No temo a su actitud, me temo que su cobarda generalizada, y el barniz pseudo-intelectual que pendejos puse sobre ella - con chorradas como Agenda de Derechos de los Hombres, y Redpilling y igualitarismo y anti-SJW y estos obsesivo puto Gates. Puede haber personas reales con buenas ideas en cada uno de esos grupos, pero usted puede estar seguro como la mierda no es uno de ellos.

As que ahora, se llega a ver la verdadera Internet - lleno de comentarios y el comercio, el discurso y la informacin, la rendicin de cuentas y responsabilidad. Usted puede venir a lo largo de la cogida, o puede ejecutar de nuevo a su hugbox, pero no me eches la culpa cuando el mundo cambia a su alrededor.

Atentamente,

de pollo sin grasa, Adulto. </TEXT>

<TEXT> /r/bestof is the money brigade. No one's getting rid of them because they pay for their show which is the sad truth.

I don't think there's a whole lot of proof behind the SRD claims, not saying they don't, but it usually gets thrown in with SRS because some aggravated poster went in there looking for a fight and got trounced. But this usually ignores the quality control the SRD moderators enforce. SRS usually links popular posts in the thousands. SRD is a relatively new addition to the people who complain vocally about SRS. 

But we do have a bunch of instances of guys who claim not to brigade actually do, like /r/kotakuinaction, who went into Planetside's sub and rolled over their community with calls to action no one wanted to hear. Either way, these mythical anti-brigading tools would probably solve a whole bunch or problems. There's a debate to be had about whether these subs help people find new communities as well, but it would also get leveled by ideologues looking to score points. 

The natural flow of Subreddit's can be disrupted by ideologues as well, for instance the Xavier Mendel affair, however this is fundamentally a debate about how one uses Reddit. If I stumble on a niche sub that SRD links to that I would like to contribute later to because I find it intriguing, and there was no other way to find it, then is that finding it naturally or disrupting the flow of Reddit. What is the flow of Reddit? It's eventually going to flow back to subjective terms, but we usually it's common sense to people.

Either way, anti-brigading tools would probably end these debates because the admins don't seem too concerned about addressing the question anymore than the one time they did, which confirmed what everyone knew and wanted to move on from and that's that "that" sub cleaned up their act to the best of their ability.

The best function of SRD is that it serves a bit as a documented history. A lot of those posters are talented recapers who do a great job of keeping the first draft of Reddit's history. There is a function there for that sub beyond "Hey, look at these clowns slap fighting over steak."  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 
Querido Hijo Varn Cojida,

Siento que ya no soy 16. de hecho he crecido, mis testculos han descendido, y mientras lo hago pasar una gran cantidad de tiempo en Internet - de hecho, mi trabajo es la construccin y reparacin de aplicaciones web - probablemente los es posible que haya utilizado, yo crezco cansado de mierda de internet.

Me alegro de que hayas encontrado 4chan y Reddit, pero saba usted, hay aproximadamente 180 millones de sitios web, ms o menos? La mayora de ellos lo hacen cosas como ropa y prestamos de noticias, o un blog acerca de su gato. O porno. Hay un montn de porno. Usted se sorprendera de que los memes desu, n **** r chistes y brosites MRA son jodidamente pequea porcin de la internet. No 0,1 por ciento. Ni siquiera cerca.

As que cuando me hablas acerca de la "Internet real" - Construyo la verdadera internet. Corro cables de red, servidores en rack, analizar los malos errores de espacio de nombres, corregir 500s, reconstruir matrices RAID, y hacer la mierda que hace la verdadera mierda internet - donde las personas se comportan como lo hacen en la vida real.

Su anonimato no te hace fuerte. Te hace mierda dbil. Usted ha decidido sus instintos ms bajos pertenecen en Internet en lugar de su humanidad, y permites que la gente como Ellen Pao y Anita Sarkeesian a tomar la cada para usted. No teme la prdida de la libertad de expresin - temes el requisito de ser un puto persona real en Internet. Tener que escuchar a su oposicin, tratarlos con decencia humana bsica y la compasin y posiblemente cambiar su mente de mierda.

Tienes miedo de rendicin de cuentas. Soy dueo de toda palabra que he dicho aqu, incluso las palabras me he lamentado profundamente. Soy fcil de alcanzar y mi verdadero nombre ha sido dado a conocer en varias ocasiones. Soy amigo de varios usuarios aqu. Mi Twitter y Google+ describen ambas mi verdadero nombre, y la mayora de la gente aqu sabe donde trabajo. Si lo desea, con mucho gusto comparto.

T, que utilizara sin irona un trmino como hugbox, est ocupado furiosa por la prdida de su cuenta. Usted necesita los chans, porque no poda soportar conmigo de hombre a hombre. Usted tiene que publicar "Lol U Mad Bro" memes, porque usted no est lo suficientemente maduro para aceptar las crticas constructivas con voz severa.

El resto de la Internet est creciendo de una puta vez. Twitter y Facebook estn difundiendo noticias y ayudar a combatientes de la libertad buscan la democracia. Tambin eran un medio para permitir que el odio se propague, pero estn trabajando para arreglar eso.

Honestamente, tengo una nueva relacin, un nuevo apartamento que todava necesita un poco de retoque, un trabajo a tiempo completo, y una variedad de actividades recreativas y los compromisos familiares. Tiempo de mierda Internet no est en esa lista. Mis notificaciones telefnicas son una parte integral de mi existencia - no puedo elegir para apagarlos durante tres horas. Conseguir brigaded no me hace llorar, o daar mi autoestima uno puto pice. Es un desperdicio de mi tiempo de mierda sin embargo, y por extrao que, cuando te haces mayor, empiezas a tratarlo ms como el precioso recurso que es, y llorar el tiempo cuando era ms joven que se desperdicia en cosas como una mierda internet.

Ningn adulto vale su sal nunca va a decir - "Me gustara reprim ms homosexuales y las mujeres y los gorditos de / b / cuando era ms joven."

Yo tambin estoy recibiendo hasta el punto en que podra querer tener un hijo, y si ella es una hija, quiero que ella sea capaz de vivir su vida libre de desprecio basado nicamente en el hecho de que ella tiene un par de tetas y que 're capaz de evitar mi retribucin de los padres.

<TEXT> The Red Pill is 120 thousand fit college educated middle class men. If we really wanted to we could invade New Zealand and install a new government. We definitely have the manpower. There are plenty of veterans here. Plus everyone here knows where the magazine release is on an M16, from years of playing Call Of Duty.

Realistically the Red Pill Reaction Force would be far more effective than half the world's militaries. The Afghan military is fucked up on opium. The Iraqi army cant even do jumping jacks. Plus New Zealand has only 8 thousand military personnel the majority of whom are useless paper pushers.

I don't actually support the violent overthrow of New Zealand. I just think its kind of a fun idea conceptualy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are a ton of meta sub reddit's but largely the ones that get complained about are ones that usually peak participation around huge drama, corporate changes that affect the whole site, but it largely stays within the house. One of those sub reddits only links to popular posts. I suppose that this would all be solved it the admins would finally release those mythical anti brigading tools because this seems to be the shibboleth that has divided people without much proof other than claims made by people. 

The only people who seem to have real proof of brigading from other subs into their own are the moderators of /r/blackladies who decided to start cataloging it in a seperate sub as a reaction to the policy changes. Otherwise, Subreddit Drama is the most active. And those moderators rigorously enforce their rules. They give no warning, they just ban "popcorn pissers" and that's that. They are constantly reminding folks not to vote or participate in threads. Considering the current drama has raised their subscription base by 20,000 people, they need to remind constantly. Otherwise, I find the claims of brigading usually get upvoted by ideologues on Reddit with no proof and that's very annoying because it should be easy. The claims of Subreddit drama voting are equally fuzzy because , and this seems to be a new claim, that's come up with less proof that there's no enforcement to check possible vote skewing.  

Otherwise, yeah, that poster always seems to have an agenda against subs that are generally progressive. The beauty of Reddit is that it gives power to people to curate whatever kind of sub they want. They can ban whoever they want and delegate whatever they want because the power ultimately lies in the hands of what the moderators want to curate as a community. They're not really beholden to corporate standards.  Complaining about it seems futile unless you can formulate a legit grievance other than "they brigade. I don't have proof, but I know they do."  </TEXT>

Southpaw is the last recorded Horner score before the plane crash, the last released score will be for "The 33." 

But Horner actually did something really beautiful. James Horner's team had actually brought Fuqua the completed written score for The Magnificent Seven. You can actually hear in the interview that Fuqua was really touched by Horner's gesture because he didn't do it for money. He just did it because he loved the script. 

It's incredibly touching to hear these stories, especially from Fuqua who you can hear get choked up about it, and hopefully we'll be able to hear Horner's final score.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nearly all of today's luxury food started out as peasant food, in fact that's a whole side of high-end French cuisine today. The truth is, we do live in the real world today and lobster is expensive and appreciated as a treat. To throw it in a shitty bun and slather it in crappy tinned dry seasonings and mayo is just a waste because any of the other lesser meats would suffice. That you people can't grasp that is just... pathetic and nationalist, as always.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The word offensive doesn't have a definition that everyone agrees on because different things offend different people. It's easy to ruffle people's feathers.

Once, a friend told me about a situation he observed in which a white customer at a grocery store dropped some change into the palm of a black clerk while paying for his food. The black clerk looked the customer straight in the eyes and said, loudly enough for people nearby to hear, "it doesn't rub off, you know."

The black clerk felt put down because she felt that the white customer was avoiding touching her because of her race. That may have even been true, but maybe he was a germophobe and treated everyone that way, or maybe he didn't like touching other people, or maybe he was just being careless because his mind was on other things. We don't know.

The thing is, the customer had no options. He couldn't stand up and say, "excuse me, everyone who just saw that? Could I have your attention? I just want to let everyone know that I'm not a racist," because that would make him look even more like a racist.

In this way, people who are members of groups that are subject to prejudice have a special power to try and convict people in the court of public opinion. They may be sensitive or insecure in ways that are not readily apparent, and there are no defenses available to people who are perceived as members of dominant, majority, or privileged groups.

This happens all the time. Look at male students who have been expelled from universities due to rape allegations without evidence (or even contrary to evidence) for example.

Because society works this way, it can be more dangerous for people who are perceived as privileged to interact with people who are perceived as unprivileged, so I would say that OP has successfully avoided a negative result in what can be a dicey situation.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> If you can't separate someone's actions from their identity and then have the gall to claim any criticism is harassment then you are a miserable excuse for a rational person. Laurlai was the reason this sub was created, because social justice hypocrites were drawing to much hate for lgbt folk with their rhetoric. when your claim to being trans gendered, bi, or homosexual is because of make believe genders or because you want to gain victim status for immunity it's despicable. These people remove all agency from women, telling them that they are helpless without feminism and that they can't be free to express their sexuality (in most cases referring to heterosexuality) without indirectly harming others. They believe that all their own problems stem from society and they have zero self awareness. It is possible that Anti GG's and third parties have posed as gg'ers to stir shit, and there are bad apples among the gg'ers that may have done the same, nobody knows. But GG's mission is to end the sexist, bigotted, and perverse overcompensation for historical discrimination that society has already deemed despicable and was moving away from that is perpetuated by SJW types. The racism towards white people that gets ignored because somehow somewhere it was decided that institutional racism = racism and that apparently there never was a society that enslaved white people (ignoring thousands of years of history, for example the Khan dynasty, germanic peoples, Moors, Celts, Greeks, fuck just about everyone has been enslaved or enslaved someone else). It also claims that preferences tacitly belie discrimantion no matter what (even if sometimes it may be that way you can't really prove that and it does not cause significant harm) and that any figure couldn't possible be criticized for any reason besides racism/phobia/sexism. The struggles of victims are stolen for the sake of pointing out how evil society is. Their irrational claims draws negative attention and encourages those that had some small amount of sexism/homophobia/etc. to justify it ("oh that crazy femnazi dyke bitch trying to tell me what to do lol" or any other sort of reaction it might cause). I personally know teens my age that will say sexist shit just to rile up our local hoard of self loathing teenage girls and people think it is hilarious. This bullshit makes a mockery of all feminism/rights movements and prevents focus on actual issues. Doxxing and harassing those who defy you're narrative is a despicable course of action. And if you think my rebuttal is harassment, you're a fucking joke and lack emotional maturity. Hurt feelings are not grounds for outcry. I will not stand for perverted identity politics that will make a world where Frozen is racist, gay men are sexist, sex is rape, any feeling of regret is rape, sex involving two intoxicated members of opposite sex puts that man in prison, women who rape are celebrated or go unpunished, living unhealthy is praised, and where criticism is tantamount to violence. I do not want draconian censorship of humor and insults that are even remotely offensive, that would be a rather joyless world. 1984 was a warning but social justice hypocrites treat it like a manual for running the world.
Edit: to the people who downvoted, does that really make me wrong? that you disagree? That the number is proof? Care to defend yourselves? No? That's right, because almost everything you got is illogical or a conclusion drawn from bias without being well informed.

https://np.reddit.com/r/ainbow/comments/3dl2hg/gawker_aids_in_the_blackmailing_and_outing_of_a/ct6azle

Extra nugget: 

They criticizing a movement that wants to eliminate disagreement and dissent that doesn't adhere to their beliefs. Orwell specifically decried this. I don't know how you have so massively misunderstood his views on societal structure. He is against oppressive practices that he clearly defined. Reactionary is a poor choice to describe GG. I could say all SJW's are reactionary, they see something they decide is not right and let everyone know. Face it, we're both mud rakers here. Fuck stains doesn't leave me with any constructive feedback so I'll move on. The sjw movement absolutely has elements of 1984, doublethink, careful scrutiny of all media for ideas that don't conform, and the desire for indoctrination.

One last one:

Proving my point, how does this prove in any way shape or form that I am a man baby? What even is a man baby? Someone who wears a diaper on Tuesday nights? Someone who is 27 and watches adventure time while high? Someone who whines a lot ("there are not enough hours in the day")? Ignorant how? Do you claim to have a fair and unbiased viewpoint of both sides? I personally know LGBT people have a shit time, T and B especially (I don't we should place value on how bad certain individuals have it, more of the whole whining about life deal) but we are gradually getting better and the best thing for that is positivity, not negativity and captious behavior. I am not gonna sit and let people tell me that we are getting worse or that there is nothing we can do except point out flaws.

It's a gift that keeps on giving:

Is politics being in games necessary? It happens in other mediums sure, but not nearly to the degree that you would like for games. Why are violent games a problem? The install base of violent video games compared to those who have committed violence in the name of games is monstrous. They aren't even comparable.

Our society for milennia has been extremely sex negative, and even your side will decry "slut shamers" Sexuality is a part of who we are and lots of innocuous things can and have been sexualized. Do you think the new Miguel album is grossly sexualized? He writes about his heterosexuality in an overt way that's at times self loathing, indulgent, and identifies his desires. I wouldn't expect someone who doesn't analyze music to immediately get it. Wildheart is a fantastic album, critically acclaimed and everything. Why focus overtly on video games/tv/movies? Mad Max wasn't a political statement, it was just good writing. You are confusing politics with being socially conscious. Content creators are free to express political beliefs but their content must also be more than a platform for their beliefs. Sunset comes to mind, it wasn't a game, but I will give the premise credit. It could have been a short film, which could have been well received but it tried to be a game for "real gamers" that lacked gameplay. </TEXT>

Yishan gets hired as a "consultant" and three months down will frame Steve Huffman by putting nude photos of dogs having sex with plushie dolls and then take over the CEO position and nuke this site from the sky while Back in the Saddle plays.

I don't think Steve Huffman is as strong a leader to get Reddit monetized and bring in users. And he's too much of a wet noodle to decide on what to ban. Even his purge picks were like, "Yeah, okay. This one is obvious, but this one will be over there, I gueeeess." </TEXT>

Let me know if you like this, because I have 8000 more things to say (ex: the history of cult, what defines "cult status", cult vs. cool, the new rules of cult in the internet age, **why I hate Quentin Tarantino,** etc.), or I could talk about specific films, too.

<TEXT> You posted a Deadline article saying that this is empirical evidence that he's doing something akin to throwing out the first draft.

Jon Spaihts is writing Doctor Strange.

That's your statement saying he's writing it, not "re-writing" it. Either way, I don't know what the fuck we're talking about. Three guys have put in work on the screenplay and that's that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not by much. A lot of his scenes were left in. The major changes by Lindelof and Scott were done by the studio; No Xenomorphs, the pod sequence was changed, the ending was a little more open, and the love making sequence doesn't end with a xenomorph popping out. 

The only change I think would have made the film better was if David did follow through with believing he was an heir to the engineers and not having the black goo sequence. Other than that, his delusions are a little unexplained. The scene that was removed about Shaw and David with the facehugger had the potential to be extremely corny.  </TEXT>

"Oh, yoooooooou hippies. If you're gonna come here then just stand at the city limits and proclaim your guilt before entering this dead city. You should feel bad from taking it away from honest people."

From all the news out of Detroit, it sounds like the honest people either died, were killed, or up and left. Why the fuck does anyone need to answer to that guy? Living in a city isn't a badge of honor. He's not Joseph Mitchell, patron saint of the working class, either.

But this line was priceless:

Thats the rub. Thats what gets me, because weve lived here in Detroit all this time and we know how to get along here.

Not long enough to save that city from bankruptcy apparently.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hope this is satire, but I've been in True Reddit for a while. They have a large contingent of gamergater, "I don't read articles," "just talking common sense" Bill Burr types. So they know their audience. 

you do realize what you are saying right? You are dismissing someone's opinion based on (your own perceived idea) of what their skin color is. It's baffling to me that you seem to be literally unable of hearing someone's opinion, solely because of the color of their skin.

It's maybe baffling, but then again I read r/videos comments [where they do shit like this](https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3dcedn/some_local_kids_in_my_town_recently_shot_and/ct44gcd). It's not like Redditors don't do it if they hear one of those infamous buzzwords.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are no content creators on Voat. The Voaters are starting to realize that the great content creators and karmawhores are the people that run reddit. It's why you can wake up every day and find up to date information. /v/movies has shit from 7 days ago sitting on page 2. There's nothing there but shit posters, the bigots and unfunny assholes that think "DAE Reddit" is a funny joak.

The worst part is the Free Speech clowns keep using this faulty slippery slope argument. Slippery slopes are supposed to end in something bad for it to be a viable argument. Coontown is not going to get any sympathy from any one if it disappears tomorrow. And Anime and their waifus won't be on the chopping block.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not a fallacy, it's a documented reality. We like to think we're immune to tyrannies, but the truth is it takes vigilance, and sometimes over-reaction, in order to prevent them. It's a tug of war, and just because we're winning doesn't mean we can stop tugging - the other side sure won't.

Best of Outrage Culture worthy in that Advice Animals Thread.

The conspiracy Yishan PR machine is apparently waking up in that Technology thread: 

Yishan is bitter Pao was thrown under the bus by Alexis and the board. He recommended her for the post, and I will bet half my karma that they have a personal relationship as well. Now he sees the perfect opportunity to get back at Alexis and the board, with some grade A shit posting. Check out some of his previous comments in the past few days, you'll get the gist. No complaints from me though, makes for some excellent popcorn.

Holy hell, this is some prime cookery:

How is that a 'PR spin machine'? That all seems terrible for reddit the company. This isn't PR spin machine, it's someone who is mad and getting revenge by airing the dirty laundry
Its PR for Yishan's cause. I hope he at least gets some of that pussy from all this white knighting.

Now the Reddit celebrities are chiming in. A famous Lizard of War has appeared:

I'm a bit confused, perhaps you can clarify what you mean:

Reddit caused Ellen's departure (you did it reddit!) but Ellen says it didn't and the board confirms.

 - Ellen was all about free speech and fatpeoplehate was only banned for inciting off-site but dozens of parody subreddits were banned after that did nothing off-site and hundreds of people were shadowbanned for criticizing her? Did she know this was happening?

- With Ellen at the helm, Reddit was immune to being criticized for intentionally creating a racist / sexist environment but Reddit is the users, not the corporate structure. How could Reddit, Inc. be criticized for promoting free speech?

 - This entire time you had vital information that could have saved your friend embarrassment and mental anguish but you didn't say anything because of "Executive Privilege?"

I dunno man, this doesn't make sense to me.

The only way this all works in my head is if Ellen was a figurehead with no actual power, had nothing to do with the contradictory decisions made, and you were under some sort of gag-order.

Maybe this was all a giant cluster-fuck of epic proportions and the lack of communication was the result of internal squabbling, but honestly, I love Reddit and I expect better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We've seen what "ignoring the subs" cause. It creates Fat People Hate to grow to its bulbous size and when the admins finally decide they've had enough of them, they boot them from the site causing a tidal wave of thousands of seemingly 20 something adults throwing internet temper tantrums. 

Clearly, ignoring and going about your Redditing experience doesn't work. It just allows large concerted efforts to grow a shitty user base to go unabated and then it seeps into other Sub Reddits. If you want to see the affect of ignoring a problem just look at the /r/videos threads where a woman talks about [domestic abuse](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3cjgit/26_year_old_woman_from_ireland_posts_video_about/) or [isolated incidents at Wal-Mart.](https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3cdhte/walmart_has_the_worst_customers/csuoqq7) </TEXT>

Nobody makes these kinds of excuses when it's a man who's being lampooned online, it's just considered par for the course. 

What excuses? The information here [is objectively wrong](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/07/13/former-reddit-ceo-alleges-co-founder-alexis-ohanian-fired-victoria-taylor-not-pao/)

About how this young beacon of talent is being unfairly judged and being character assassinated? Yeah didn't think so.

<TEXT> EDIT: [Shit, your whole post seems silly now.](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3dautm/content_policy_update_ama_thursday_july_16th_1pm/ct3n7hc)

[Kickme444](https://np.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/3d2hv3/kn0thing_says_he_was_responsible_for_the_change/ct1fczz) stated on Theory of Reddit that Pao didn't fire Dacvak for Leukemia. And [it's been confirmed that Alexis fired Victoria](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/07/13/former-reddit-ceo-alleges-co-founder-alexis-ohanian-fired-victoria-taylor-not-pao/)

Also, Ellen Pao does not have a board seat. Alexis is still her boss. He was Board chairman and he already admitted to firing Victoria. He just did it in the most sheepish way possible by letting Pao take most of the heat. There are other holes in your essay too. Op-eds are peoples opinions. They are inherently bias. You linked two of them. That's not a sign of media bias. Also, you'd have to prove that there's an end to what the media bias is supposed to achieve here other than "redditors are kinda shitty people."

Secondly, media bias isn't in most of the articles you linked considering most of your linked articles all correctly reported Sam Altman's statements about "sickening" behavior. 

For some reason you brought in this weird men vs women stance while arguing that gender and identity politics don't matter in this case when according to the end statement of your essay, they do?

Finally, Redditors aren't a privileged class of citizen. This is a social media site, we don't get any sort of civil rights here. Most of the decisions alleged to Pao have been refuted by admins and other sources from Reddit. And she did receive an undue amount of shitty behavior from Reddit's user base.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The well goes deep. "Sandra Bullock and Halle Berry; Doing Great as Single Moms:"

It is considered a feat to make a marriage work in Hollywood. Celebrity couples due their hectic work schedule, plus the media who constantly poking and over sensationalized a simple circumstance need not to be publicly known and invaded privacy certainly added pressure to the struggling unions of the celebrities and superstars. 

There is an apparent increase of celebrity single parents lists. The most popular alibis are; divorce, new found love, unfortunate passing of their partner and the decision to move forward with becoming a parent in their own right. Recently is Bridget Moynahan, whom Tom Brady left in favor of supermodel Gisele Bundchen. The actress is famous in her role as John Cusack's fiance in the movie Serendipity seems adjusting well to her new solo job a single as mom. 

Sandra Bullock follow through, the actress life-changing year has included an Oscar win, a divorce filing and an adoption. Public was sympathetic to Bullock when news of her cheating husband, Jesse James broke. It is a public knowledge that Jesse James philandering acts prompted Sandra Bullock to file divorce. Sadness was replaced by joy for her elated adoption of her baby boy, Louis Bardo. 

Halle Berry and boyfriend Gabriel Aubrey heading to Splitsville and are now reportedly battling over custody of their daughter, Nahla. The gorgeous actress has a very rocky and public love life. Her recent split from boyfriend Gabriel Aubrey, and father of her daughter, Nahla seemed amicable at first, but there had been a change in the direction of the wind as the two are embroiled in a custody battle. 

Kudos to all single parents, celebrity or not. Your toil deserves great appreciation. And one way of showing is through giving mothers jewelry. There is a wide selection of personalized necklaces and personalized jewelry to choose from. So let your creative juices flow and pick a unique mothers gift. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Another gem called How to Become Famous Like Justin Bieber:

Do you want to become famous? And do you want to become famous like Justin Bieber did? **Well what if I was to tell you that it's not actually that hard to do?**

Bieber may be too criticized by many but is a great example of what the marketing, social networking and other elements can do.

First Bieber began releasing their videos through YouTube, a platform that has given 5 minutes of fame to many people, but these 5 minutes stretched into years due to other internet tools... Twitter.

If we learn from the biography of Justin Bieber is that if someone wants to become famous, should begin now to put their videos (as real as possible) on YouTube, because you never know who might "accidentally" discover your talent for delight the young fans. 

This is exactly what has happened to Justin Bieber.

Twitter really help Bieber began to attract attention from your target market. Many marketers still do not understand the scope that is Twitter users and yet this was the platform that Justin used to engage with your audience. Justin currently offer your movie called "Never Say Never" (never say never), a type of documentary which presents the story of the singer and how he came to where he is now.

And of course had to take a perfume especially for girls called "someday" but the video is a little weird and may even get you a laugh, in two days has reached the 2 million views. A very good example is Google; that is starting to become obsessed with the pop stars. This search engine company has made a change in its marketing strategy. Last month, he joined Lady Gaga in an ad to show all the opportunities offered by the Chrome browser. Now he has done the same with Justin Bieber.

The announcement is similar to Gaga, but also shares some similarities with the recent announcement Dear Sophie, which shows a father using Chrome and other Google products to remember her daughter's childhood.

It makes sense that Google has thought Bieber for their promotion. The young celebrity was discovered thanks to his performances uploaded to Youtube. And with it, Google manages to reach an important demographic: teenage girls.

One of his secrets: Its well-defined market.

Justin Bieber is not intended that all are his fans; he knows it would be almost impossible, yet the market for young girls have it well controlled. So it adds the elements of marketing, good use of digital tools and a well-defined market and the rest is history. </TEXT>

<TEXT> More brilliance, a review of No Strings Attached from a paper mill:

The funny can be credited to screenwriter Elizabeth Meriwether, who not only creates lead characters that are likeable, but has surrounded these people with a surprisingly rich supporting cast. There is not token best friend that gets all the lines. There's actually a posse. Natalie Portman's Emma and Ashton Kutcher's Adam are surrounded by friends and co-workers that are very very funny without having to resort to outrageous infantile humor. Heck, they all seemed like they could be any of the inherently funny people that I know in the real world. 

Adam and Emma meet cute as teenagers at summer camp where his sheepish moves on Emma fall flat. The run into each other again at a frat party in college, then again a few years later. As always happens in the movies, they are destined to end up in the same state, in the same town, at the same time. So when drunk and depressed Adam calls every phone number in his cell for a booty call, he ends up waking up in Emma's Los Angeles flat surrounded by her roommates. Emma is now a workaholic doctor, and Adam works as a middling minion in the television business. Emma doesn't have the time or energy for a real relationship, so she proposes that she and Adam become fuck-buddies. What guy would refuse? 

I think it is interesting that there is a string of "no strings attached" sex comedies spilling into the theaters. And they all seemingly have the same twist (which is not much of a twist when they are all the same): In the modern take, it is the guy who falls for the non-committal woman first. But where the similar setup of Love and Other Drugs failed from lack of chemistry between Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway, Natalie and Ashton actually make a cute couple. Their quips seem natural, and even though Emma is a bit over-the-top bristly whenever she thinks she is being conned into a relationshippy-type moment, she is still appealing. And who doesn't like to see Natalie Portman have an occasional potty-mouth moment? That's right. We all like a smart girl that swears. 

No Strings Attached does falter a bit. It struggles with momentum toward the end as it falls into the predictable territory of whether or not these lovers should also be together for realz. Hollywood does always want the perfect kiss at the end. But until then, I was totally enjoying the ride. Along with great supporting turns by Greta Gerwig, Mindy Kaling, and Lake Bell (along with more awkward appearances by Kevin Kline and Cary Elwes), No Strings Attached is funny escapism with a great cast that won't leave you feeling cheated after your two-hour fling at the movies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> More gems from a genuine paper mill producing top notch film criticism:

They're wicked and foul with the stench of 40,000 years. But what would movies be without them? While most are truly quite horrific, others are actually funny. But throughout the many years of cinematic history, one fact has always remained constant about movie villains... we love to hate them. 

Heroes get all the hype, but deep down, we all love a good villain. I can take or leave the square-jawed boy scout, the do-gooder who gets the girl and saves the day; but the villain is a different kettle of genetically modified laser wielding fish altogether. 

Funny Villain have more fun and get most of the best lines. Movie history is littered with fiendish foes, evil overlords and malevolent masterminds we loved to hate. The summer blockbuster is the perfect breeding ground for evildoers and this year's pageant of box office behemoths provides rich pickings, from robots out for revenge to muggle-hating wizards. 

Cinema is filled with memorable villains. Whether it's the sardonic cheer of Gert Frbe's Auric Goldfinger, or the sneering oiliness of Die Hard's Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), the movies are full of superb, loveably evil performances. The hero may get the girl and save the world in most instances, but it's the villain who gets most of the quotable lines. 

It's like the alignment of the planets. Occasionally, a great director, an exemplary script and a gifted actor will join together on the same project, creating the kind of unsettling performances that linger in the memory for years afterwards. 

Michael Mann's 1986 adaptation of Thomas Harris' novel Red Dragon was the first movie to bring cannibalistic academic Dr. Hannibal Lecter (in this instance spelled Lecktor due to rights issues) to the big screen. 

Robert De Niro chews both characters and scenery in a manic performance as Max Cady, an ex-convict who terrorises lawyer Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte) for apparently failing to defend him effectively in court fourteen years earlier. 

An indifferent and Funny movie villains can be threatening as a villain with an almost cartoon-like evil uniform like Jason Vorhees from Friday the 13th. In The Matrix (1999), the army of 'faceless' agents are cold and emotionless and suggest an unbeatable threat with which the hero cannot reason or negotiate. 

The all-powerful emotionless villain is portrayed excellently in the X-Files TV series by William B. Davis as the Cigarette Smoking Man. Throughout the series he is constantly in control of the heroes and any attempts to kill him are deemed self-destructive or futile. His power over the protagonists' behaviour is linked to his role in the Syndicate, a mysterious organisation who seemingly are more powerful than the U.S. government. 

On the opposite end of the scale are the villains that are emotive, excitable and with exaggerated personas as demonstrated by Heath Ledger's villain in the most-recent Batman film, The Joker. The latest incarnation of the Clown Prince of Crime perfectly conveys his lack of empathy and almost-humorous contempt for human life. The most prominent aspect of The Joker is his colourful clothing and unusual physical appearance, with white face make-up, dyed green hair and smudged red lipstick. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a film which involve sex industry. Sometimes I think I would rather to catch a triply to watch than to sleep with a dull man, Because each set is very short, it probably still can give you the climax, even it is a neuter version. I still remembered that I really did't think Belle is a beautiful woman when I watched season one. But I have been able to appreciate her beauty to season four. I like to watch her to receive each customer in high spirit. She let me become more believe that there is some people really like to be a prostitute as career. From her, I felt a little shamed, I just in labor, I didn't work hard.but she does't. 

Ben and Han is alike,both are brave,Both have the courage to make a choice, choose what they want, rather than they should.From the start, Ben appeared in Han's world, his state cannot be removed. From season one Ben delayed he and Vanessa' s wedding ceremony, at that moment, I knew he was really love Han.real love. But they finally broke up. Ben wants a family,but Hannah cannot give. just because she know she cannot give,she choose to leave. Hannah just wants to be herself.They separate,not because they don't love each other, they are too love.they love, but cannot give each other they want. So they say goodbye. Losing Ben, it means, Hannah and bell lose everything, but she finally decide so. love, like on you. 

In fact, I know they will not be together at last, but I still hoping. Finally I having no choice but to Give up the lens. Sometimes. Two people who love each other deeply always can not be together. That's it. If it's you. Would you do as Hannah. Choose to leave because love too much. When you can't give your lover what he needs. When you can't let him be happiness. choose to leave is more great than to possess him.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Allow me to submit for your fair-minded consideration the following "news diff" of a recent article from the venerable New York Times. Compare and contrast, if you will, these two timestamped versions of the "same" story on Ellen Pao's resignation from Reddit:

[Comparing: Its Silicon Valley 2, Ellen Pao 0: Fighter of Sexism Is Out at Reddit](http://newsdiffs.org/diff/934341/934454/www.nytimes.com/2015/07/11/technology/ellen-pao-reddit-chief-executive-resignation.html)

Now you may not care about the goings on at Reddit, but be that as it may, this shoddy piece of yellow journalism perfectly exemplifies the *narrative* that pervades so much of today's news. What was once a merely slanted article entitled "Ellen Pao Is Stepping Down as Reddits Chief" was swiftly replaced by an outright propaganda piece painting Pao as a heroic but embattled warrior for equal rights in the midst of that oppressive white boy's club we call Silicon Valley, wherein she "fell victim" to the overwhelming sexism and racism which is both inherent to the tech scene and rampant among the vile Reddit userbase. Of course nothing could be further from the truth, yet an "op-ed" label somehow escaped this nakedly biased writeup.

In reality, Ellen Pao "fell victim" only to her own poor decisions, her own incompetence, her court-documented history of abusing coworkers and subordinates (male and female), her and her husband's shady grifter past of long-cons and frivolous discrimination suits seeking outrageous payoffs, her being completely out-of-touch with the very community she was brought in to manage, her intentionally vague and widely reviled initiative to transform all of Reddit into a so-called "safe space" (despite years of drastic increases in censorship across almost all of Reddit), her brazen double-standards in applying said policy to ban specific subreddits while leaving many more hateful, toxic, and rule-breaking subreddits untouched, her lack of desire to use Reddit or even understand how it works (in one celebrated instance, she actually tried linking to a message from her own inbox, like a boss), her off-site PR campaigns in defense of her bad decisions and policies on places like Buzzfeed (reviled by many Redditors) rather than engaging directly with the Reddit community (as challenging as that may be), her callous sacking of popular employees such as /u/kickme444 who ran Reddit's yearly secret santa gift exchange and was reportedly terminated *because he had leukemia... even though he was able to work* (he later deleted his story and said he'd only discuss it with Reddit Inc, so it would seem that Pao's legal team intimidated him into shutting up), and last but certainly not least her reply at a company meeting that "you'll have to pry this position from my cold, dead hands" upon being asked how the search for a permanent CEO was going (as alleged by another former employee). This list actually goes on and on; this was really just a high-level overview to illustrate what an incredible human being she is and what an amazing job she did as the interim CEO of an online community that was anathema to her.

In a word, Ellen Pao was nothing short of antithetical to the core values that Reddit and its community were founded upon and have historically espoused, as Pao herself hinted at when she announced her depature:

 gt; "So why am I leaving? Ultimately, the board asked me to demonstrate higher user growth in the next six months than I believe I can deliver while maintaining reddits core principles."

Although Pao succeeded in alienating the vast majority of regulars that populate the site during her brief stint as CEO, the casus belli leading to her ultimate downfall was her sudden firing of Victoria Taylor, a universally beloved Reddit admin and crucial point of contact for moderators when conducting AMAs. The unexpected and flippant dismissal of Victoria for undisclosed but much-conjectured reasons triggered a sitewide revolt led by the site's moderators, who shutdown most major subreddits in protest of her firing, all culminating in a change.org petition for her ouster skyrocketing from 10k signatories over a few months to over 200k in just as many days. The majority of these moderators are very (if not radically) progressive, often to the point of being called "social justice warriors," meaning it's richly disingenuous to attribute Pao's departure to the clamor of right-wing trolls.

But none of that matters one wit because as everyone knows, Redditors hate nothing so much as they hate women and minorities (except fatties, perhaps). I mean seriously, have you even seen some of the vile names of those awful subreddits they let fester there?! Because if you haven't, the media will remind you of their names, again, and again, and again, as if these purposefully provocative subreddits, whose simmering popularity is first and foremost a result of ever-increasing censorship everywhere else, suddenly represent Reddit if and when anyone from an officially-sanctioned victim class waving a flag of ideological jihad comes under fire for being a world-class shitheel.

Never mind that what set off the final firestorm was the termination of a *female* employee. All of this hate couldn't possibly have anything to do with Pao's shady past, or her shady husband, or her terrible judgement, or her detested policies, or her nasty behavior, or her callous firings, or her ideological hubris, or her embrace of censorship, or her double-standards, or her lack of empathy and communication, or her awful leadership, or a staggering number of other failures. No, it couldn't possibly be any of that because as always, **narrative uber alles**. Now that Ellen Pao has been called a bunch of mean names by an army of anonymous trolls, we're stuck in the "poor Ellen" room, and neither her shady past nor her failures as interim CEO bear repeating nor need be scrutinized.

It's therefore a foregone conclusion that Redditors hated Pao because of her race and her gender and because she was a "fighter of sexism" who became "a hero to many." But what did this "hero" accomplish for women exactly? If firing rockstar female employees, banning salary negotiations, screening job candidates for ideological purity, imposing intentionally vague policies of censorship, and exhibiting all the hallmarks of a Harvard-league grifter before losing a $160 million "landmark" discrimination suit is somehow sufficient cause to be lauded as a brave crusader for social justice in the hallowed tradition of Martin Luther King and Susan B. Anthony, then our brave new world is in very big trouble.

Just how and why Reddit's board of directors selected such an inexperienced, ill-suited lightning-rod for mass-hatred to impose overwhelmingly unpopular site changes during a mere handoff period is anyone's best guess, but what we do know is that the seemingly appalling reactions to Pao's brief reign were anticipated well in advance by most reasonable and knowledgable observers of the situation. What's even worse is that the author of the original NYT article actually sallied forth into /r/KotakuInAction, that villainous hivemind of #gamergate misogynerds, ostensibly to conduct his own AMA, wherein he proceeded to dodge every upvoted question challenging the veracity of his  lt;cough gt; narrative due to these aforementioned pesky facts and inconvenient truths, none of which somehow made it into the revised version of his article:

[I'm Mike Isaac, the New York Times Reporter covering Reddit. AmA.](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3cur16/im_mike_isaac_the_new_york_times_reporter/?sort=top)

As you can see, the NYT wasn't even remotely interested in publishing the truth. In all likelihood, this so-called journalist merely stopped in to troll for hate speech and retreated upon finding himself incapable of inciting any salacious tidbits fit to be plastered over his next edition of agitprop masquerading as journalism. But that's just supposition, meaning it's something I would never publish as fact unless I were, you know, a journalist for the New York Times.

But wait, there's more! Here are some other shining examples of unvarnished journalistic integrity, starting with the highly esteemed Guardian:

[Reddit chief Ellen Pao resigns after receiving 'sickening' abuse from users](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/10/ellen-pao-reddit-interim-ceo-resigns)

[How Ellen Pao lost her job but survived Reddit's swamp of trolls](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/12/ellen-pao-reddit-trolls-feminist-silicon-valley)

[Pao quits Reddit after attacks on her leadership](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e833f86e-274b-11e5-9c4e-a775d2b173ca.html)

The London Evening Standard:

ZDNet.com:

[Reddit CEO Ellen Pao resigns after week of 'sickening' attacks](http://www.zdnet.com/article/reddit-ceo-ellen-pao-resigns-under-fire/)

DailyBeast (op-ed):

[Reddits Terrorists Have Won: Ellen Pao and the Failure to Rebrand Web 2.0](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/11/reddit-s-terrorists-have-won-ellen-pao-and-the-failure-to-rebrand-web-2-0.html)

Credit where credit is due though, NPR surprisingly ran a [relatively even-handed piece](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/07/10/421877979/ellen-pao-out-as-reddit-ceo). Let's just hope it stays that way.

Now I'm not saying that Pao didn't receive a huge outpouring of crude and spiteful messages, which she clearly did. But somehow I never saw any of these supposed death threats. Yes, there were some death wishes, but let's not conflate "eat shit and die" with "I'll murder you and your family." Such fine details, unfortunately, didn't deter Sam Altman of Reddit's board of directors from dutifully and publicly shaming the Reddit community over their supposed death threats, as though hate mail to polarizing figures in the public eye is unheard of, and as if any would-be murderers reading his patronizing bromide could be dissuaded from sending death threats in the first place. But of course that was not the point of his handwringing exercise in public relations.

Altman's finger-wagging screed in hand, the media had all it needed to run with the narrative that Redditors are literally terrorists, ie. #gamerate redux. And boy did they run. All of these histrionic hyperbolae and identity politics and psychodramas are part and parcel of the media's stock in trade, which is why all of this was predicted well in advance by those following the situation, many of whom are by now all too familiar with its played-out professional victim routine. Manufactured outrage and clueless moral panic from the mainstream media are nothing new to those of us who have lived and breathed old-school internet culture most of our lives. We never forgive and we never forget such classics as: *DOOM caused Columbine. Anonymous: hackers on steroids. Over 9000 penises. Pool's closed. The hacker known as 4chan. #Gamergate*. And so on, and so forth, and so the dragon must be slain over and over and over again, even in our present, supposedly internet-savvy age. Most disturbing of all is that with each manic news cycle, the dragon only grows larger, nastier, and more adept at dividing our society against itself to devour piecemeal both our liberties and our capacity for meaningful and authentic dialog.

<TEXT> Basically it means that Yishan can freely beat around the bush and Reddit can't really do much. But I was talking about the inevitability that Reddit would go after Yishan for making innocuous statements about how Reddit handled a very public situation because of a nondisclosure provision. I don't even know if he signed one. He would probably have been the one to make the decision on whether to have one. 

It would make Reddit look worse to their user base who will see Yishan as a whistle-blower and in the press because those statements from Yishan are going to get signal boosted. I imagine that if push comes to shove, and with Yishan's tendency to not take shit like that sitting down, we're going to find out in the near future whether the "cancer" statement is true or false.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Between this and his public outburst against that shit-talking ex-employee (that was him, wasn't it?) he seems to be an extremely unprofessional individual.

The weird thing about Reddit is that it allows former employees to air their grievances out and corporate has no way of confirming or denying the accusations. Imagine what would have happened if Yishan never responded and just decided to let that simmer. Intimidate public opinion would shift because a Reddit employee says he was fired indiscriminately. 

Yishan basically kicked it in the balls instead of becoming one of those lightening rods for Reddit to seethe at. And then the process repeated itself during the Ellen Pao era, except corporate handled it properly by not putting itself in the area of divulging the nature of someone's employment history. 

All this means is Yishan is clear now to pop some corn around Reddit's offices.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Granted that I have no idea what the terms of this guy's termination were, but I can't imagine they didn't include nondisparagement and nondisclosure provisions. And now, in the litany of things that people who are anti-Pao like to rattle off at the merest mention of her, "fired a guy for having cancer" and "pry this position from my cold, dead hands" are regular features.

Think of the position Yishan puts Reddit corporate in now that he said this and KickMe said there's dirt on people and Yishan is going all "fuck it" on Reddit and Twitter.

Reddit is basically one of those justice scales right now and Yishan just tipped it in favor of the transparency set that make Reddit's most vocal members. If Reddit attempts to go after Yishan for just poking around the bush, they're gonna piss off that user base, who'll go fucking nuts and they already got through pissing them off just a few weeks ago.  </TEXT>

I imagine cartels are smart enough not to cause violence on American soil. They probably realize that if they did that would basically mean the beginning of the end of that kind of access to the border. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've read Michael Gibney's [Sous Chef](http://www.amazon.com/Sous-Chef-24-Hours-Line/dp/0804177899) which tells a similar story. I gather Anthony Bourdain's Kitchen Confidential is in the same vein, but essentially what I gather is that you get 3 hours to prepare for lunch, one hour for break and dinner prep and the rest of the night being behind on orders. Did you ever work in a kitchen with the ambition to become a head chef? From my experience reading these books they're either treated like war narratives or ones where people had the ambition to become head chefs and own their own restaurants. 

Have you thought of starting a sub reddit with the ability to tell all those stories? I'm having a hard time wondering why you mod the subs you mod, bothering with the metaverse and other unsavory subs to put it lightly, and yet you still refer to the guys you worked with as a second family. </TEXT>

The original claims were: 

1.  Only comments criticizing her incompetence and/or equating her to fascist leaders. 

2.  There are so many people who keep ranting about the racism/sexism, but provide no evidence of these accusations. 

I provided proof of both, twice. Unless you can refute the claim I really don't need to entertain the bunch of childish baby responses I woke up to saying "cunt isn't really sexist, we we just posting we wanted to punch this cunt in the face but it was in the appropriate subreddit!

<TEXT>  Stop being pedantic. 

Would you prefer I don't treat your comment with the respect you expect it to be given and just say "hurr durr pedatic, ur wrong?" I can't pick out the "spirit of your comment" when it's wrong because the comment that started this conversation was over the fact that someone was denying that any activity whatsoever of sexism occurred let alone made it up to the front page.

For instance, out of all the signatures that signed the Ellen Pao petition the [numbers on the words "Cunt" and "Bitch"](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/3cfpoa/word_cloud_of_reddits_ellen_pao_petition_oc/) out pace regular prepositions. And this is out of all participants who commented on the petition. Unfortunately, I don't think they're calling her a "cunt" because they know her personally and therefore can attest to the validity of any of these statements. If you want more fun selections from Reddit's grand petition [enjoy the video from the guy who did the data-mining on it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8IIey7vydM)

In comparison to reddit's 160 million unique monthly visitors, they are a minority. A vocal minority, to be sure, but they represent around 0.1% of the reddit userbase, assuming that every one of those subs is an active, unique user (and they aren't all active and unique).

160 million users of which the [overwhelming majority is male](http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/social-gender/465979). And which an overwhelming majority of that majority managed to launch a large organized temper tantrum resulting in a CEO stepping down making their "DAE Pao is literally Hitler" campaign seem legitimate. Did [Yishan end up getting this treatment when he banned The Fappening?](https://np.reddit.com/r/fuxtaposition/comments/3c1bn6/ellen_pao/) (NSFW). [Did this occur when Yishan instituted policies at Reddit that banned Jailbait?](https://np.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplehate51/comments/39on4t/ellen_paos_cunt_very_nsfw/) (Also NSFW). 


But if you want more proof you really just need to compare the statements of Steve Huffman who essentially rephrased the same policies of Ellen Pao and the responses from the same audience who actively went out of their way to downvote her responses into the thousands. Ultimately, this is a conversation about the pernicious nature of these communities that eventually turn their giant crybaby campaigns into organized efforts to take over the community center. The question becomes do you want these guys (the people who don't contribute or enjoy becoming apart of communities) to be able to take over the community center by rushing from their dank basement and taking a baseball bat to good communities, which seems to happen with regularity now, or does Reddit take the stance that allows free association to also include the ability of free exclusionary measures to weed out those pernicious actors?  They can't have it both ways. 

Not many calls for Huffman as being literally Hitler when he said he wouldn't bring FPH back or that he wanted Reddit to be a safe place for all sorts of communities. Then again this is a different conversation.

<TEXT> The creators I'm talking about literally run all the defaults and the thousands of other medium and small sized subreddits. None of these people are employees of Reddit and they had the power to shut down the subs that account for a lions share of its traffic and Reddit couldn't do jack shit without pissing off even more users. It's insane how much power Reddit corporate has given over the main subs that drive traffic. 

The entire point of Reddit is that you can create the subreddit you want, curate the community you want to have, with no restrictions.  Unfortunately, users seem to believe this entitles them to undermine creators intent by saying that they want the ability to freely post anything if it means posting it, having it removed by a moderator, but still having it be there. You've just removed the ability for moderators to do their job of curating a subreddit, which is exactly what they do thanklessly for free while going about the other obligations of their daily life. 

If moderators at /r/askhistorians want to curate a subreddit that aims to be like a historical journal why would you remove their ability to do that by taking their power away to deal with comments and users that undermine the sub? If I'm an editor of a sub that aims to the editorial standards of The New Yorker, then I don't want a bunch of one line posts about "DAE broken arms jolly racher chris nolgan?" clogging up my pages. But if you want to make a sub that allows that, the Reddit gives you the ability to do so. The issue here is users not realizing the power of editorial decision making is only a click of the button away. Outside of that it becomes a discussion about getting eyes on shit that the moderators didn't want in their subreddit and users complaining about censorship because they weren't able to hijack an audience for what usually are bunk causes.

And I'm overthinking it because these are the issues that will arise. Thinking about it makes sure a policy doesn't go into effect that will drive people away from the site before they make a mistake in implementing it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because you're taking away the power of moderators and creators of subreddit to create the subreddit they wanted. People seem to misunderstand that Reddit is a place for creators, by creators and made with the purpose that you would curate the experience you want to create. 

If you take that power out of the moderators hands then you're basically asking for all sorts of things that you didn't want. The moderators of these quality subreddits have no obligation to stay and tolerate it. 

You already have moderators here clamping down on shitposts. Can you imagine placing new rules that would ensure higher quality posts and then having the company who tells you to do whatever you want and create the subreddit experience you want that you now have lost that power?  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I don't think anyone is saying that there hasn't been any sexism or racism directed at Ms. Pao. 

The original commenter said both that he had seen no posts in the postive numbers that were racist and that "there are so many people who keep ranting about the racism/sexism, but provide no evidence of these accusations."

These are both patently wrong statements which negates yours saying there hasn't been anyone denying that Redditors really shit the bed on this one. And one only has to look at the response when Yishan stepped down as CEO. He was the one behind the banning of both Jailbait and The Fappening and yet my front page was not flooded with babies calling the CEO a cunt, "a gook" and "this fucking bitch."

The complaints against Reddit are valid, but not when you have these type of people attempting to hijack a conversation about the fact that Reddit didn't really give a shit about interacting and communicating with the community that keeps its doors open. And these aren't minority numbers. These are thousands of people as the screenshots show. FPH had 150,000 subs, KiA has 40,000, SRC has around 10,000 and all these people keep giving the community a shit name. Meanwhile, cunt wasn't something thrown around when Yishan did the exact same measures against subreddits like Ellen Pao did.

"There's no evidence of sexism or racism"

"Oh, well, cunt is really a term of endearment."

"Oh, well, calling someone a gook isn't racist."

I don't know what you're looking for, but it seems like when presented with evidence you just want people to keep giving it to you until it's a mountain full of it. Then when there's none left to give you'll go, "SEE! I told you. No sexism or racism."

<TEXT> SJW ideology has brainwashed the minds of certain people into becoming part of what can truly be described as a hate group that preaches a type of equality called "inclusivity" in a style which can accurately be described as "deliberately exclusionary".
What they do is strategically hide behind politically correct labels and rhetoric that will safely shield them from the criticism or suspicion of the most uncritical eyes and ears at all times, switching their story and affiliations around as needed to maintain the lies they tell. They hide their true motives behind already accepted norms so they can make power grabs to further their influence by talking about only the "victims" (themselves included of course) of supposed social injustices that just need to be corrected. These messages are generally delivered with a sense of self-apparent urgency due to just how offensive these (s)not at all made up(/s) injustices are.

Meanwhile, more SJWs are tactically suppressing the visibility of anyone who might offer reasoned dissent of the notion that there is even an injustice occurring in the first place. They accomplish this using all manner of strategic manipulation of the flow of information to drown out any signals that contradict the victim narrative, once the move to establish it has commenced. How do SJWs obtain such control over the narrative of a subculture? They accomplish this by being in control of what is both seen and said in the groups they attack, while also policing what everyone not currently under attack by them sees and says as well. What they do is find a group of people who are their own subculture that the rest of the world largely doesn't pay any attention to, and they study it. They decipher what is good about it and what makes it popular while digging for what can be maximally portrayed as not so good about it to learn how that culture's rhetoric can be manipulated on as wide a scale as possible. They find online communities where the most people of this subculture gather, then use their influence to gain positions of power within the subculture's highest ranks, and begin infecting the subculture from all angles with their victim politics campaigns, subtly and over time, until it becomes too much for everyone in it to ignore. All reasonable attempts to subvert or remedy the trend are swiftly denied traction.

The inevitable ensuing outrage is then used to point fingers, framing all the angry outbursts as evidence of how abusive and harassing the people belonging to the subculture are. SJWs spread this falsely reframed narrative as far, wide, and quickly as possible within SJW circles, injecting the accusations into the mainstream's consciousness during the height of the backlash. From there, the trap is sprung, and the helpless true victims of such lies and slander are forced to defend themselves and their values in front of a misinformed public. The controversy builds and builds like a fire the SJWs ceaselessly fan the flames of in order to milk all the sympathetic attention they can exploit from it for profit.

The SJWs do all that, while simultaneously saying the only path to true equality is to denounce, shame, and ruin the lives of these whole subcultures of people who have been successfully framed to look like the very enemies of freedom and liberty the SJW ideology itself actually is. The SJWs patronize all resistance by spinning anything that threatens the narrative into more ammo to keep the narrative going. This results in the targeted subcultures becoming divided, and becoming further splintered over and over as SJWs endlessly harass into silence every last loud voice that cries out in opposition. The end goal is to force what remains of the subculture to conform to SJW ideology.
What SJW ideology doesn't want anyone to understand it seems is that the solutions SJWs choose for correcting any perceived social injustices are purely destructive to the relations of literally everyone involved. In other words, the path to progress as far as an SJW is concerned, is backward while giving third parties the appearance of moving forward. SJWs deliberately alienate the mainstream culture from subculture after subculture in this way to "smash the patriarchy", which according to SJWs, is straight men; the whiter the better.

Every group SJWs have infected have all been accused of misogyny, toxic masculinity, and hostile intolerance of minority groups on one level or another at the first sign of resistance. This effectively drives out all the straight males by demonizing their sexuality as well as by their skin color depending on how highly represented their ethnicity is within the subsculture. This means that SJW ideology is, among other nasty revelations, thinly veiled bigoted hatred disguised as critical moral concerns aimed at men primarily. Given that SJWs believe white people are the most privileged race on earth, it is absolutely racist toward white people too.

In effect, SJW Ideology is a tool for dismantling any subculture that is predominantly male, and they call any resistance during the takeover a hate group while the subculture dies of SJW cancer.

GamerGate is the first group that I have seen that not only hasn't given up, but after being pushed around long enough, they're falcon punching SJW attackers back and gaining ground. This shit is like watching Rocky take a beating in the first couple rounds then come back on his opponent with the eye of the tiger theme song playing in the background. This shit is like watching the entire Freeza saga of DBZ. This shit is awesome. </TEXT>

From there, the trap is sprung, and the helpless true victims of such lies and slander are forced to defend themselves and their values in front of a misinformed public. The controversy builds and builds like a fire the SJWs ceaselessly fan the flames of in order to milk all the sympathetic attention they can exploit from it for profit.

The SJWs do all that, while simultaneously saying the only path to true equality is to denounce, shame, and ruin the lives of these whole subcultures of people who have been successfully framed to look like the very enemies of freedom and liberty the SJW ideology itself actually is. The SJWs patronize all resistance by spinning anything that threatens the narrative into more ammo to keep the narrative going. This results in the targeted subcultures becoming divided, and becoming further splintered over and over as SJWs endlessly harass into silence every last loud voice that cries out in opposition. The end goal is to force what remains of the subculture to conform to SJW ideology.
What SJW ideology doesn't want anyone to understand it seems is that the solutions SJWs choose for correcting any perceived social injustices are purely destructive to the relations of literally everyone involved. In other words, the path to progress as far as an SJW is concerned, is backward while giving third parties the appearance of moving forward. SJWs deliberately alienate the mainstream culture from subculture after subculture in this way to "smash the patriarchy", which according to SJWs, is straight men; the whiter the better.

Every group SJWs have infected have all been accused of misogyny, toxic masculinity, and hostile intolerance of minority groups on one level or another at the first sign of resistance. This effectively drives out all the straight males by demonizing their sexuality as well as by their skin color depending on how highly represented their ethnicity is within the subsculture. This means that SJW ideology is, among other nasty revelations, thinly veiled bigoted hatred disguised as critical moral concerns aimed at men primarily. Given that SJWs believe white people are the most privileged race on earth, it is absolutely racist toward white people too.

In effect, SJW Ideology is a tool for dismantling any subculture that is predominantly male, and they call any resistance during the takeover a hate group while the subculture dies of SJW cancer.

GamerGate is the first group that I have seen that not only hasn't given up, but after being pushed around long enough, they're falcon punching SJW attackers back and gaining ground. This shit is like watching Rocky take a beating in the first couple rounds then come back on his opponent with the eye of the tiger theme song playing in the background. This shit is like watching the entire Freeza saga of DBZ. This shit is awesome. </TEXT>

<TEXT> SJW ideology has brainwashed the minds of certain people into becoming part of what can truly be described as a hate group that preaches a type of equality called "inclusivity" in a style which can accurately be described as "deliberately exclusionary".
What they do is strategically hide behind politically correct labels and rhetoric that will safely shield them from the criticism or suspicion of the most uncritical eyes and ears at all times, switching their story and affiliations around as needed to maintain the lies they tell. They hide their true motives behind already accepted norms so they can make power grabs to further their influence by talking about only the "victims" (themselves included of course) of supposed social injustices that just need to be corrected. These messages are generally delivered with a sense of self-apparent urgency due to just how offensive these (s)not at all made up(/s) injustices are.

Meanwhile, more SJWs are tactically suppressing the visibility of anyone who might offer reasoned dissent of the notion that there is even an injustice occurring in the first place.

<TEXT> Shameful display.  This article ignores key facts in order to push a preselected narrative.

1) Pao was not subjected to any particular vitriol on being declared interim CEO, nor until after she began implementing questionable and unpopular policies --- such as banning fat-shaming forums while leaving far more foul content entirely alone.  Even geek-famous fat people (Such as Boogie, a popular Youtube commentator) spoke up against this ham-handedness (and you will be hard-pressed to find anyone on the Internet nicer than Boogie).

2) Pao clearly did not care about the racist/sexist slander, and good on her for that.  No matter how justified one might think they were, that is not how mature and intelligent people handle outrage.  Then again, when tens of thousands gather to burn the President in effigy while screaming approval, mocking his intellect, gender and skin color, we call that a public protest and ask the Administration what they did wrong.  (Note: I'm referencing anti-war protests against Bush)

3) The petition is what gained traction in the press, and it is clearly what Pao is resigning over, BECAUSE it got traction in the press and brought attention to her actions.

Your article is smearing over that with faux outrage --- and I notice that your co-author on the piece also references two of his own previous NYT articles about Pao's legal issues as another way to deflect all of this criticism.

The NYT should not be soapboxing for corporate officers they happen to like.  It's as shameful as when one of your Pulitzer-winners recently tied "Bronies" to accused mass-murderer Dylann Roof merely on basis of a photoshopped t-shirt she had no time (or interest) in verifying before publishing reference to.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Look, I know exactly what you're doing.

You're trying to conclude that Pao was the victim of sexism because people used language like "cunt" or some other insult; your reasoning being that the slur has some reference to "gender" attached to it, therefore, she is being insulted based on her gender.

This doesn't follow nor does it examine the motivations for why someone would begin to insult her.  Do you really, really think people insulted Pao merely for being a woman?  Then you really do need to explain why people stuck up for Victoria.  Are you going to invent something about how people only defended Victoria to give themselves the appearance of caring about a woman?  That's about as uncharitable as you can be, but at this point, going through your history, I don't think you're here to engage with facts or truly analyze why people felt the way they do but to try to go quote farming for your next big "thinkpiece."  The reaction to Victoria being fired is direct contradiction to the story that redditors, etc, are just trying to drive women off the website, or wherever--and all you just did was handwave it away.  Doesn't fit the story?  Then don't include it.  Journalism at its finest.  Why not claim Victoria was let go out of some gender narrative?  It's just as baseless as the other shit you're trying to claim, but that won't stop you.

I'd suggest you don't understand the sarcastic, caustic, and sardonic nature of internet culture where people will say all sorts of offensive things (even racist or, yes, sexist) despite the motivation being different, but I honestly don't think you're that dim and you're doing this out of an ideological basis to give your personal pet issues more advertisement and try to claim they're really the issue you say they are, blah blah blah.  So let's take this about another character that was unpopular; nobody likes or liked George W. Bush, and everyone made comments about how he looked like a chimp; do you really think people bashed him solely because he looks like a chimp?  No, he was bashed because of his policies and other reasons.  People insulted Michael Moore's weight not because he was fat, but because they were motivated by contrary politics or perceptions of his honesty. This hive of bees doesn't care what gender is sticking its hand in the hive; it'll sting flesh regardless of who it's attached to.

You're going to write up a piece referencing sexism and racism on the internet, removed entirely from the context of the conversation, claim "Chairman Pao" references are motivated solely by racist intent and that her being called a "bitch" is because she's a woman above all else.  You're going to slant this, mislead, and then pat yourself on the back for this bit of "activism."

Nobody gives a flying fuck what Pao's gender is.  Are you this big of an idiot where you think there's some widepread male supremacy movement on the internet?  Go on, prove it, then.  And don't use your feelings or humanities crap, use actual social science.  People here are more concerned with reddit generally keeping a hands-off approach to its communities and not favoring any political perspective (even refusing to censor the most vile ones) than the personal identities and the lives of the admins.

So let's drop all the pretenses.  You know you're being dishonest and you're full of shit, trying to drum up attention to pet causes.  Obviously, we know it too.  So what is your goal here?  It's to try to influence the uninformed, propaganda style, to try to get support for your politics  And you're a piece of shit for trying to play that kind of game.

And I'm not going to be polite to you about this either.  Because this entire show of you being "polite" or professional while you farm for vitriol for your next write-up is just to give yourself an air of professionality and respectability you don't deserve, and to give the impression you're trying to give people a fair shake when your conclusions were predestined.  When you're surrounded by your colleagues, drunk late and night in a bar chatting about work, I'm sure the discussion is much, much different.

<TEXT> Without meaning to sound condescending, I really think you should endeavour to excavate a little deeper into the mineshaft of cinema. Dumb action-flicks and superhero films are the common metals near the top of the mineshaft. They're completely accessible: everybody 'gets' them. You don't have to do much work to get the shallow sort of no-frills 'entertainment' they provide.

However, something which most teenagers are not yet aware of, is that down there in the mineshaft is a wealth of precious gems so beautiful and so thought-provoking that if you experienced them, you would never want to go back to the rather common and mundane stuff on the surface. Down there are films that can make you cry and leave you in a state of heightened emotion for days. Down there are films that can change your perspective of how you view your own life, or how you view other people. Down there are films that will worm their way into your brain and start to become a part of your identity.

But you can't just leap down the mineshaft. If your diet consists of Transformers, Harry Potters and Avengers, you will break your neck if you try to dive straight for the Blade Runners and the American Beautys. Challenge yourself to dig downwards. Watch films from as many different genres, time-periods and cultures as you can. Try to inch away from your comfort zone. 

Again: please don't think me as being condescending. This isn't an intelligence thing. People who appreciate the "depressing philosophical bullshit" of films like Birdman aren't more intelligent than you. They've just put more time into exploring cinema and adventuring into their own personal mineshaft. I know it seems comfortable at the top, but I can promise you that digging is very, *very* worth your time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Without meaning to sound condescending, I really think you should endeavour to excavate a little deeper into the mineshaft of cinema. Dumb action-flicks and superhero films are the common metals near the top of the mineshaft. They're completely accessible: everybody 'gets' them. You don't have to do much work to get the shallow sort of no-frills 'entertainment' they provide.

However, something which most teenagers are not yet aware of, is that down there in the mineshaft is a wealth of precious gems so beautiful and so thought-provoking that if you experienced them, you would never want to go back to the rather common and mundane stuff on the surface. Down there are films that can make you cry and leave you in a state of heightened emotion for days. Down there are films that can change your perspective of how you view your own life, or how you view other people. Down there are films that will worm their way into your brain and start to become a part of your identity.

But you can't just leap down the mineshaft. If your diet consists of Transformers, Harry Potters and Avengers, you will break your neck if you try to dive straight for the Blade Runners and the American Beautys. Challenge yourself to dig downwards. Watch films from as many different genres, time-periods and cultures as you can. Try to inch away from your comfort zone. 

Again: please don't think me as being condescending. This isn't an intelligence thing. People who appreciate the "depressing philosophical bullshit" of films like Birdman aren't more intelligent than you. They've just put more time into exploring cinema and adventuring into their own personal mineshaft. I know it seems comfortable at the top, but I can promise you that digging is very, *very* worth your time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Shostakovich, String Quartet No. 3, Op. 73

Cailin Quartet:

Clara Bk, violin

Sophia Bk, violin

Stine Hasbirk, viola

Therese strand, cello.

1.Allegretto

2.Moderato con moto

3.Allegro non troppo

4.Adagio 

5.Moderato.

**Dmitri Shostakovich, 1906-1975**

**String Quartet No. 3, F major, Op. 73, 1946**

Just after World War II, Shostakovich, then forty, turned once again from his public orchestral music to his private chamber music, composing his String Quartet No. 3 in F major, Op. 73. While he had already written nine symphonies, Shostakovich was just settling into his emerging series of string quartets that would eventually comprise fifteen quartets written throughout his mature life, including some of his very last compositions. Many feel that the String Quartet No. 3 is among is his best quartets; it was a favorite of the composer himself.

It shows Shostakovich in his full powers as a chamber music composer, skillfully deploying the string quartet to express his utterly distinctive musical personality. From a technical standpoint, the quartet, like many of his later quartets, features an astonishing range of textures, sonic effects and brilliant part writing in the service of music with startling emotional and psychological impact. Successful as abstract musical expression on the one hand, it is nearly impossible to miss the topical and programmatic nature of the quartet, another aspect common to most of Shostakovich's chamber music.

The unspeakable hardships of life in the Soviet Union up through the end of WWII took their toll on Shostakovich: nervous, bitter and depressed, he found his most profound outlet in the safe privacy and intimate expressive capability of chamber music. String Quartet No. 3 is a particularly powerful example. </TEXT>

Of all the nearly forgotten music by Mendelssohn, the most nearly completely forgotten is his music for chorus. Only his songs come close to being as almost entirely ignored, but because a few of them have earned a place in the recital hall, even they have a more prominent place in the repertoire. This 10-disc Brilliant set of Mendelssohn's complete choral works featuring the Chamber Choir of Europe under Nicol Matt addresses this problem even though it may not solve it. The performances are uniformly excellent. The Choir has a smooth tone and superb diction and Matt elicits from them polished balanced and ardent interpretations. Despite the dearth of comparisons, these performances with their clean textures, light tempos, and devout tone are surely as close to definitive as is possible to imagine. For some listeners, of course, this may not be enough to redeem Mendelssohn's heartfelt yet stolid music from obscurity. For others with more open minds, however, this set may serve to introduce a body of sacred works that certainly exceeds any other similar body of works from the same period in terms of skill and sincerity. Though a bit recessed, Brilliant's digital sound is cool and clear.

<TITLE> [Discussion] Questions about Footloose. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-08 09:55:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Now, it's been quite some time since I've last scene the original Kevin Bacon movie about a guy who fights a town with roundhouse dance movies, but watching the remake I noticed something suspicious. Mainly the central romance between Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough is less authentic than the real one between Miles Teller and Kenny Wormald.

If you're not familiar with the remake of Footloose it came out to the acclaim of no one and was promptly forgotten amongst the shit heap shores of remake island with Total Recall and Straw Dogs. It's the same story except Craig Brewer, the director of Black Snake Moan and that shit where Terrence Howard pretends to play a big boy not on the verge of tears and raps and shit, does something I really don't remember in the original film.

I started getting my suspicions when the introductory scenes between Ren Mackormick (Wormald) and Willard Hewitt (Miles Teller) had this strange air of sexual tension. For instance, Willard and Ren sit down for school lunch and Ren begins to tell Willard of his worldly travels. It's here where all my experience reading erotic novels from Anne Rice and Henry Miller have paid off because Willard starts asking Ren to finish the story of the night Ren went out with two Russian women and had them as his sexual conquests.

Why does Willard want to know this? Especially after they just met. When Willard finds out Ren's story is false he's disappointed like he had a bunch of armed thugs rob his spank bank of Ren Mackormick related erotic fantasies. 

It only gets weirder from here because every interaction with Julianne Hough is dry and unromantic. He's basically trying to save this psycho girl from trying to kill herself, she attempts to play chicken with a train (like she was gonna win...sorry you don't have roundhouse kicks, Hough) and she's under the impression this means Ren loves her when Ren's true love really lies with Willard. 

As the movie goes on Ren learns that Willard can't dance and that in order to challenge the city counsel on the ordinance to make dancing illegal they must have a tete a tete at a car wash where Willard and Ren talk about wet t-shirt contests. But then promptly Ren douses Willard with the car wash hose. When this happens Willard runs around to Ren and they begin wrestling. Perhaps if Craig Brewer had trained his camera a little longer on this scene Ren would have tripped on the water line and Willard would have fallen on top of him. They would have realized that they are in love and embrace each other in chaste french kisses as the music swells and they go off to city to live a bohemian life style. Ren would become a steel worker and Willard a starving artist painting nudes of Zebras and rats with large phallus's on their heads.  

But no. Brewer denies us this possibility for more cock teasing and more audience approved heterosexual mating with Julianne Hough, Now a note on Julianne Hough. Hough is amazing looking.  She really nails the part of playing a down home southern preachers daughter rebelling against her father but she also wears small shorts and this is distracting because it's like on some level Brewer knows he accidentally directed Brokeback Footloose, but ended up having to save face by adding this eye candy. 

Either way, we then have to sit through tedious montages of Willard learning to dance, and it's in the key scene where Willard dances with Ren's nieces in a line dance rendition of "Let's Hear it for the Boys" that really seals the deal because in between the already extremely homosexual undertones of that scene, Brewer adds inserts of Willard and Ren learning to dance in Ren's garage just as the sun falls down. Ren is teaching Willard to "fist-pump" and it looks as if they are holding each other in a masculine version of a ballroom waltz. But this repeats the formula of the car wash scene in which Brewer has the realization that he made Priscilla, Queen of the Footloose Dancefloor and cuts too soon out of shame. 

The movie marches onto the finish, shit resolves and that's how I learned the remake of Footloose is a great movie about two high school boys testing the limits of their sexuality. And if that didn't convince you, the bearback bang bros bus driving scene will.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I experienced something very similar to this, but probably worse in my opinion - not even a week ago.

On July 1st, I got off work and was doing some late night grocery shopping - not even that late, it was about 10:30pm - at the Kroger near my house, who also supply several of these handicap grocery carts for disabled customers which are usually located in the front of the store. I had noticed that this evening, there was none available, because a disabled woman was walking around on a cane asking for one. 

I thought it was strange and was like oh well, must be busy - it is the first of the month. Not very many cars in the parking lot, but I guess people are bulking up for the holiday. So I go on shopping.

Inside the store doing my thing, right off the bat I see 3 people on carts who were clearly not disabled. Of which, one guy was letting his kid, a 7 year old - drive it around, while he walked along side. And this was right in front of the store, in ear-shot of that lady who actually needed a one. They could hear her asking for it, still did nothing - kept on going.

It really pissed me off, but I thought well, maybe they're disabled and it's just not evident. I'll hold my tongue, just do my shopping - get out of here.

So I keep on going, I see a 4th cart - same thing. This time 2 young women, which got my attention when one got up and let the other sit/drive the cart. I just stopped and stared at them like... for real? You know there's a lady up front right now who actually needs one of these and you guys are just riding around on it for fun??? And they went off on me, same way this guy did - "YOU CANT TELL US WHAT TO DO" - I just threw my hands up, kept on walking.

I get to the checkout lane, waiting in the only line they have open - when sure enough that kid that was driving one - crashed into a display right next to me, knocking over a fuck-ton of shit. The parents response? Not no, "I'm sorry" or "oops" or anything even remotely fucking human - they just walked away. WALKED AWAY - cart and all. Leaving all that shit.

My Kroger also has a self-checkout lane, but because I had so much stuff I decided to wait in line. So during my long wait, those 2 women who screamed at me for telling them what to do - they checked out right as I was finishing bagging my groceries. I walk outside and they are plugging it in, one talking to the other about how they better hurry - they're going to miss their bus.

Seriously, that was the most frustrating grocery trip I've ever had. I've never felt like a racist before until that moment - because it dawned on me. Out of the 5+ offenders, they were all black. Loud, and ignorant, and black. And the lady who didn't have a cart who actually needed one? White. I seriously wanted to punch those people, especially the cunt black family that crashed the cart into a display, and the poor white Kroger employee just walked over and started picking it up - like it happens all the time. 

I'm never shopping again on the 1st of the month - seriously. It made my blood boil, the whole thing.

<TEXT> I can't wait for the day when things stop being about black white and yellow and brown and all that stuff and we can just call assholes, assholes. This black guy pisses me off. I'm a black guy and if I call this idiot out, I'm considered someone that's sucking up to white people, by other white people here on reddit. It's already happened multiple times. When you're a black guy and you call out the retarded behavior of other black people instead of prtending it's reasonable behavior, you're called a coon and a sellout by the same black people do this stupid shit.

And all you white middle class liberals need to snap out of this delusion that it's only a hand full of black people like this guy in this video. Take it from someone who knows. a huge percentage of black people have this guy's fucked up mentality. 75% of black mothers are single (the reason why would make this post even longer) and these guys (including myself) are raised by these women alone so they have to over compensate by acting more aggressive and masculine.I got lucky because my family comes from the country and not the inner city. My mother got her masters degree and became a college professor. I went to private school for the first few years of my life and then got an almost culture shock when I went to public school in the 2nd grade (we were never rich or even middle class, but lower middle class. my mom had to retire early after getting really sick, though she's doing well now). Kids in private school were mostly polite. The "bad kids" were just class clowns at worst. But then in private school, all the kids were cursing and using the N-word left and right. There were fights every other day, and I'm pretty sure in like 3 or 4 instances from 2nd to 5th grade there was always that one student who had to sit by himself near the teacher's desk and he clearly needed to be in a special needs class.

My point is that there are a ton of shitty black people out there and there are a good bit of great black people. The same goes with asian, white, latino, etc etc. When a black asshole is being an asshole, everyone should be able to call him or her out on it without being a white racist or a black sellout. Yes, racism exists, but if we're going to move forward we need equality on all fronts. I actually like it if a white person can disagree with me and argue about something and call me out on something if I'm doing something stupid in person, because they're speaking to me in the same way they'd speak to a white person that did the same thing. But when they decide to talk down to me like I didn't know any better because I'm "just a dumb child like black person" and just pretend like I've done something valuable it's irritating. We'd should not be treated like retarded children who don't know any better. That's not going to fix "racism"

<TITLE> Why Christopher Nolan will never be Stanley Kubrick, and why that's ok: From Our Friends at Voat True Film. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-07 09:12:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Perhaps more than any other filmmaker in recent years, Christopher Nolan has a following. These so called "Nolanites" love to tout the brilliance of his films, and one of the most popular statements has been to call Nolan a modern Kubrick. Despite being a big fan of Nolan i've never quite understood this statement, especially considering Nolan's visual style does not have much in common with Kubrick's. But I think it goes beyond that, and after seeing Interstellar it finally clicked for me what the biggest difference is: Nolan's films lack subtext. It really is that simple. For whatever reason, Nolan wants his characters to say exactly what they are thinking at any given time. If a character is mad at another character, they will state it plainly. The same goes for every single emotion. There is no misdirection, lying, innuendo, or nuance. It's as if Nolan wants to make sure we understand what the character is feeling and doesn't trust us to infer it by context. This doesn't just relate to character feelings, but also to plot and theme. Look at the ending of Interstellar. When he gets to the weird Library near the end, we get it. We're literally seeing it happen. We don't necessarily understand how it's happening, but we do understand what is happening. Despite this, Nolan decided to have McConaughey and Chastain both state out loud to themselves what is going on, multiple times. Why? We already see what's happening, why exactly do we need the characters to awkwardly reinforce it by talking to themselves? This is especially interesting when you compare this scene to the ending of 2001, a film that Nolanites have been trying to compare to Interstellar since the film was first announced. In that famous ending to 2001, Kubrick doesn't explain anything. He just presents it, and leaves the meaning up to your own interpretation. This forces you to think about the film and what was happening, and is key to why the film is so iconic all these years later. This is night and day different from Nolan's approach to a similarly bizarre event. Nolan chooses to explain it numerous times, just incase we were sleeping I guess, and the ultimate result of this is that we get it. There's nothing to solve, and we leave the theater not questioning "oh what did that mean?" but instead saying "huh, that was interesting" and then proceeding to realize all the plot holes in the film. I admit I was in the crowd of people that was really hoping Nolan would finally "grow up" and make a picture that treats the audience with respect, but after seeing Interstellar i've realized he's just not that kind of filmmaker. Which leads to me the "why that's ok" part. You know what? I really enjoyed Interstellar. It was a blast and one of the most enjoyable theater experiences i've had this year. Despite being 2h49m, which is actually longer than 2001, I never felt bored for a single moment. This is the great skill of Nolan...he makes the most enjoyable blockbusters out there. And I accept that. I no longer wish for him to "grow up", because I actually really enjoy seeing his films. Sure, I don't think about them much afterwards and I will never put them on the same level of the great filmmakers, but for pure entertainment nobody does it better right now than Christopher Nolan, and for that I will always be a fan. </TEXT>

Excellent movie, excellent gun play, reminded me of John Woo except tighter, more grit and far more paced for straight action. But how did Eva Longoria even manage to find this one? Is she gonna be a producer on the next Continental film?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Questions about Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers [spoilers] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-25 07:44:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Why would anyone want this film dedicated to them?

why did they keep doing the same "I'm about to walk out of the room oh shit i made a noise" trick 12 times?

So this baby stayed in the cabinet all night and part of the day and NEVER made a sound? Does no one go to bathrooms in bus stations? I've been to bathrooms in bus stations and it's like a urine donation center where they pay 5 dollars for a half gallon of your pee. 

If Michael Myers house is curse why did someone sell it to a new family? Who are these people? Why do they keep a shit broke down car on the lawn? Do they want it to look like a halloween house? The dad said he doesn't like halloween.

Why is the mom so naive? Like her kid keeps running away from her. Can't she see that this kid is a lost cause? He probably wants to get offed. 

What does the annoying blonde kid everyone hated have to do with Michael Myers? He's not blood releated. They don't make mention of this shit other than saying that he gets nightmares. But the baby is related to Michael Myers. What the fuck is this mythology?

What did the legion of the tipped hat do to get Michael Myers to have a kid? Did someone jerk off Michael Myers? Is Michael Myers a horny guy? Because he doesn't give any signs of it. 

Why does the legion of the tipped hat seem in cahootz with Michael Myers, but at the end Mr. Myers kills them? What was the point of them anyways? They were fufilling some half assed made up prophecy that i'm still not sure what the goal was, but they don't make sense.

What's the green goo? This addition made no sense. Why is there green goo? There's one insert shot of a bunch of letters. Is this Green Goo concentrated letters? Did scientists discover the alphabet is real? Why has this not been shared with the world? People would love to see real life letters. Sesame Street would be so cool.

Why is Michael Myers so fucking overpowered? I get he's a cereal killer, but this guy has fucking transportation power, but he can only walk. This makes no sense. How did he get these powers? Isn't Michael Myers just some large ass idiot with a high pain tolerance and a killer streak? Why is this not enough? Why does he need to be Halloween Goku? 

Why is Paul Rudd in this movie? I don't get his presence. He puts these family idiots in more peril second only to the main lady who's just a danger to herself. What's so important about the teenage kid? He's annoying. Let him go.

Why is this called the curse of michael myers? Michael Myers is just a dumb killing idiot machine. The curse is by the cult of the tipped hat. What does this have to do with ancient letters? Those letters never appear again after they are mentioned. 

Why even bother making number 6 if you don't have a script? This shit made no sense. Why does the lady not just drive till she runs out of gas back to town? Why did she stop at the bus station?  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I tried everything to get him to watch anything other than the 8 or 9 Marvel movies. I tried breaking his arms, I tried showing him other movies where I edited the Marvel logo in to trick him into thinking that MArvel produces Orson Wells and Carol Reed movies, I even tried to take him to a hypnotherapist to get him to see that Marvel movies aren't the best thing ever made. It turns out my son is leaving with my DVD of Batttman Vs Superman. Should I be worried? He said he wants to fornicate passionatly with the DVD and that there's nothing wrong with a relationship between a DVD and himself. 

My son has also decided to sexually identify as a DVD player and I told him you can't do that because it's all about imax and blu ray 8k you'd be behind the times and I'd have to disown you can't you idenify as a blu ray player at the least or a pc and he said no because he likes consols better and I said I have to disown you son. I don't know what to do. Is Battman captain of the Marvel team? I just can't figure a way to get to my son fifi. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why are there no subtitles for Eddie Redmayne. He speaks like he's trying not to get caught pissing off in church.

Does NO ONE live in Chicago? I get the whole "we got alien CGI artists who can fix this to hide our presence" but during that whole dogfight apparently only three people live in the city. 

Why bees? How did this not get established in the prolouge?

Why is Eddie Abraxis so careful to not kill other human beings sometimes but sends his goons to kill three guys just ramblin' around a Chicago bridge? This dudes track record seems inconsistent. 

Why did Queen Kunis know about the telescope, exact make and model of the one stolen from the house in the beginning, was being sold on ebay? Her mom didn't tell her this stuff, or at least it's not established. 

Why did Channing Tatum break character when Mila Kunis offered to dress his wound with a tampon? 

Why is Mila Kunis in this movie? Why does everyone look like they are from Farscape? Is this a Farscape movie?

Why does Mila Kunis' cousin keep saying "Only English?" Does he know he's in a movie? Are CGI subtitles expensive? 

Why is there a romantic comedy in the middle of a space opera? I feel like Tim Gunn would feel these clash and would be poking at this movie saying "MAKE IT WORK."

How did Channing Tatum Master Chief that ship shirtless, in space, and without a suit? Only Master Chief can travel in a slipspace rupture outside of a ship. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> What are these levels for creatures? Why mention that they have levels if you're not going to mention them again?

Why did Ben Barnes love interest admit everything villainous she's doing to Barnes' face and the dude didn't go, "Wait wut you're spying on us?"

Why did Jeff Bridges sound like he had fallen and had not been able to get up for such a long time?

If Ben Barnes is a witch why doesn't he have cool powers like everyone else? Is he a big dud witch? 

Why did Antje Traute sound like she was phonetically reading her lines off a cue card? I know she can speak fluently.

Why was Ben Barnes dad such a push over and what happened to the pig catching Barnes was supposed to do? They're in a small fenced area, how hard is it to catch one?

Does that big Ogre man have like super fast legs because he moves slow as fuck but he manages to find these dudes where ever they are in no time?

What's the deal with Pendle mountain? Is it a mountain? It doesn't seem like anyone has trouble finding Mother Malkin's hideout. It doesn't even seem like it takes long to get there at all? Can Pendle Mountain really be a mountain or a hill?

Why is [Marco Beltrami's music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EDhvQzcSes) better than anything in Seventh Son?

Why does Dijon Honeysue seem so overpowered and smart for the first hour and a half, but then turns into a big dolt in the final fight? 

Why did Malkin think there was going to be a sequel?

EDIT: Since making this post I have some additional questions.

Why is this not a Marvel movie? 

Why does Mother Malkin need that gumball crackerjack toy neckless when she and her crew are already ridiculously over powered?

Jeff Bridges has one week to train Ben Barnes, but this dude Barnes seems like he's pretty much a boss with fighting shit? What's the point of training? 

Why did JEff Bridges keep a demonic knight in his house if he knew that that shit would be dangerous?

Why is this movie so geographically fucked? I mean it looks like this shit has vast expanses between shit, but they seem to get everywhere really quickly? Do these dudes got nike j's or some shit?

And on the journey, they got one week, but it seems like they go past one week? Why one week? Mother Malkin seems like did a fine job without one week to fuck up shit? Why is Jeff Bridges so bad at his job?

What is Mother Malkin's skill set? Why does she have some sort of power to do interior decorating? Where do you get that power with all that shit?
