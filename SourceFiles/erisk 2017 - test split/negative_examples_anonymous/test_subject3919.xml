<TITLE> The Acrolith, Part 2 </TITLE>

<TEXT> First Part: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3djttv/the_acrolith/





**1:01am**

Ive been hiding in my my house now for just over a day and it has been quite. I think I may be safe-ish from Rufus, or *The Acrolith* for the time being. Im guessing he, or *it* doesnt know exactly where I am, but I cant imagine him giving up on me. I havent slept or let the picture out of my sight. About an hour after I got home since the incident at Moss Hill I heard sirens of all types blaring past my apartment complex. But what is bothering me the most is there is no buzz about it. Nothing on social media, nor the local news. But I found this, an Acrolith is a sculpture made from stone and other materials such as wood. So I suppose that correlates with the disgusting stone arm, and terrifying monologue.

So I suppose there are two options for me:

1.) Hide here and hope to god that thing doesnt find me, then live the rest of my life in fear

2.) Try to fight back, most likely with this picture


By reaching out on the internet Ive found that my best option is to burn the photo. Im gonna throw in some salt and whatever holy, monster killing mumbo-jumbo I can think of. But first Im gonna try and get some shut eye, but I doubt that will happen. Wish me luck




**6:23am**

I dont know if it was restful enough to be called sleep, but whatever it was I was woken up from it by an email from someone using the address  *xDrzt7n@gld.n* . Now that adress brought me no where, but the anonymous sender did. They wrote:

	 You cant do a single thing to him, or any of them. Surrender all memory of him and your photo and you just might survive. Good luck.

This short message is more than a lot to take in. How the hell should I feel about that? According to this stranger I can give up my memory/memories to him along with the photo and be quote unquote survive? And what does he mean by them?! Are there more demon-freaks now?! Who the hell is this guy anyway?!

I sent a reply asking for elaboration, but got nothing in return. I felt like my time was running short. I decided to risk going back to the asylum. Not inside, but around the adress to get a look. So I threw my old binoculars around my neck. But I realized I should have the photo somewhere hard to reach on my person, where it would be safe. So I slipped it into my sneaker and went to my car.




**7:02am**

Its gone. The whole fucking building is gone. There no rubble or anything, even the driveway is gone. Its just... woods now. Am I in the right place? Whats the address again? Shit my head is **not** cooperating. What is happening to me?




**7:30am** 

I began to feel uncomfortable as I explored what I think is the lot. It started so faintly that I didnt even acknowledge it. But it began to grow painful, specifically in my foot. I panicked when I realized it was the foot that was in the same shoe as the photo. I almost broke my ankle tearing the shoe off in fear, but I didnt dare lose possession of the polaroid. Once the shoe was off I clamped my hand over the opening, in case rufus was nearby. Heat radiated out of my shoe like a space heater. So I plugged the hole in my shoe with a sock and threw it in my trunk.

Why the fuck is the photo hot? I dont know what to do at this point. Im going back to hiding.





**3:44pm**

He found me. For a split second my phone laptop and tv all switched to a view of my apartment complex from across the street behind. The image was looking up from a bus stop. Ive barricaded all doors and called the cops to report a break-in. Im in my bedroom with my gun (Yes I know it wont do me much good but Ill take my advantages where I can).




**3:59pm**

The building is beginning to, oh fuck I dont even know! *Morph* I guess. Its disgusting, the whole structure almost seems organic. The drywall is flowing and climbing on itself and making a horrible crackling and gurgling sound, it almost looks like its breathing. I can hear the other tenants freaking out in the rooms around mine. Its grown deeply cloudy outside and the polaroid is hot again.




**4:13pm**

Moments after the sirens arrived outside, The Acrolith finally spoke ***NO MEMORY OF ME SHALL REMAIN. I WILL CONSUME YOU. WE ARE ANCIENT*** his voice tore through my mind like bullets. Fuck this, Im so furious and terrified. Im gonna do it. Im uploading the photo for all of you to see, Then Im gonna burn it. I have no idea if this will do anything to him, but if you have the guts, please save the photo. Maybe even print it off and hide it somewhere. If its existence hurts him then I want you all to see it.

<TEXT> Part 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3dzlvu/the_acrolith_part_2/


Countless google searches have brought me here to this forum. Never used reddit before, but I guess this is where people who have had experiences like myself accumulate. Ive never had to fear for my life before, despite my line of work and I dont know what to do. Running seems pointless due to my situation and the police are of no use. I dont feel in control of my own existance anymore. I feel like I'm going to be ripped apart.

Ive worked at the Moss Hill Institute for the criminally insane for just over 2 years now. I never went to college. But when you 66, 230 lbs, and own a security guard license; its easy enough to be hired as a guard. I used to enjoy guarding, its stressful, but rewarding work. But this is NOT what guarding should involve. I should never have been put anywhere near something like that without knowing about it. I swear if I make it out of this Im suing anyone I can. Fuck Moss Hill. I wish I never worked there.

 Well, I didnt always work there I used to work as a bouncer at a nightclub two towns over. When I heard about security work only about 20 minutes away, I was so deeply relieved. A job that didnt require 2 hours of driving every morning and every night. And an even better perk than a short drive was the fact that I got to work in the security room , monitoring the CCTV screens. easy-peasy. I had landed the job I was going to ride with all the way to retirement. Little did I know about the one person that would make that job hell. Rufus Baker.

Rufus Baker was not my angry boss. Nor my shitty co-worker. Rufus Baker was a patient in our mental hospital. I had heard his name at least 10 times on my first day. He was a high-profile patient kept in restraints at all times. Though no one really knew why. He had been there since he was a young adult. His origins were unknown. But we knew asking questions about Rufus was an easy way to get fired (That was in fact the reason for my position being open). He was a very thin, light skinned with thin grey hair. But, the most definitive feature of Rufus was his stoney grey eyes.

Rufus seldom stirred. And is he did stir it was to stare at a different part of his pale blue room. He looked at the wall as if he could see straight through them, to all corners of the building. When switching through the screens, I always seemed to come back to Rufus. He was our only patient kept in high security at all times, but in comparison to some of the other patients, he was completely harmless. Twice a day two people would come in and feed him and a Doctor would look at him and a little screen next to his bed, then write stuff on his clipboard and leave. Watching him was completely mundane and boring, but I couldnt stop. I had always been into mystery novels and the horror genre. So trying to figure him and some of the other interesting patients out was a lot of fun for me. 

Things began to change when I had done a routine check of all the cameras and went back to Rufus to see if he had changed positions. He had not. Bored with the cams I decided to try and draw Rufus (Im no artist, but doodling kills time). I pulled out my sticky notes and drowsily reached for a ball point pen to my right. I tried to pinch it between my fingers, but I realized there was no pen to grab. It was now about 5 inches from where I had originally saw it. Puzzled, I grasped at the pen again, it then skittered like a bug across the entire width of my desk, and fell down between the frame and the wall. I sat there for who knows how long in complete awe. I looked around for any sources to the pens movement, but found nothing. To make it even worse I couldnt reach the pen now because the desk was built into the floor.
	
I sat back down and laughed it off. I opened my desk and reached for a new box of pens and popped it open. Luckily these put up no fight I turned towards my sticky notes and scrawled on the top one was  ***DONT*** . Similarly to the pen incident, I searched for a source to the note, and found nothing. Due to my usual choice of media, I have a tendency to jump to conclusions and freak myself out. I calmed my senses and began to think rationally. This was a prank, it had to be. I shook it off thinking I would discover the source later.

And I did discover the source, but sooner rather than later. On screen was Rufus, looking straight at me. I felt shivers run down my spine and goose bump crawl down my arms. I got up and swiftly backed away from the screen. His stony eyes followed me the whole time as if we were in the same room. Very unsure of the situation, I fled the room to take a much needed coffee break. I had to clear my head, and get away from the screens. I thought it couldnt have been real, I was just sleep deprived. Or maybe I had too much to drink the day before? When I returned, I didnt switch back to rufus for the rest of the evening.

I was nervous to go to work the next morning. I actually had the phone in my hand at one point to call in sick, but I was also excited that something was finally happening with rufus. I finally felt like I was in a mystery novel. Ive spent my entire time at Moss Hill trying to figure Rufus out, and now I was starting to know why. But when I got to work I didnt even look at Rufuss cam until 4 hours in. And when I did he was just sitting there, as usual, like a statue. I was deeply discouraged, But something caught my eye, in the corner of his cell, were a pile of pens. My pens. All of my Pens were gone! I promptly got up, and let my boss know I was going home sick.

I didnt return to work for a few days. I instead used my time to try and figure out what to do about the whole situation Being a very superstitious person. I decided that it was most likely safer find a job as a mall cop, but I would regret dropping it for the rest of my life. So I did some research, and it came down to either I was crazy, or he had some form of telekinetic power. And he must not want his image recorded, at least on paper (I assumed this because he seemed to leave the video recordings alone). I wouldnt resort to telling my superiors about this yet, because when people get involved with him, usually results in their termination.

I brought a new pack of pens with me and an old polaroid camera, to test my theory of him not wanting to be on paper. I didnt let my bag containing my pens and camera out of my sight until I was ready to try it. I tried the pens first. I got a hold of them fine, they put up no fight. I started to circle back to my assumption that I was crazy until I discovered that I couldn't get a drop of ink out of any of them. This surprisingly made me excited. I reached down for the camera with shaky hands. As I aimed the viewfinder at the screen I saw Rufus slowly crane his neck in my direction (Or at least the direction of the camera in his cell). My heart was now beating like bass drum. I snapped the picture.

Almost instantly Rufus did something I don't think anyone has ever seen him do. He stood up. Not like how you think someone who has spent their life in bed would stand up either. He stood up swiftly in a single motion, pulling through his restraints like they were fashioned out of pipe cleaners and paper mache. All lights in the building began to flicker and dim. The building seemed to shake. Not shake like earthquake style, but like jiggling jello. It was like all of reality seemed to tremble. Everyone on the CCTVs seemed to react too. A deep voice rang in my head and shook my body to its core.
***I AM THE ACROLITH. BEFORE THERE WAS LIFE THERE WAS STONE. BEFORE THERE WAS STONE THERE WAS ME***
He jutted his arm out to the side in a violent manner, his stony eyes seemed to emit a deep, grey light. On one of the cams I saw something that straight out of a nightmare. A patient in the cafeteria began to grab at his torso like he had a bomb inside of him. Suddenly a giant, malformed, stone and wooden arm burst from his chest cavity.

The arm fluently grabbed another patient and threw him at a group of tables with incredible force. The poor man with the abomination jutting out of his chest collapsed to the ground and the arm went limp.
***YOU WILL NOT REMEMBER ME. I WILL CONSUME YOU***
I could now see that everyone heard and felt the voice. Patients and guards alike were holding their head on all of the video feeds. You could feel the presence of Rufus all throughout the building. It was like being in a sauna and having someone with a hot wet towel wrapped around your neck. I felt fatigue grip my whole body and I collapsed to my knees, then puked up what little I had eaten. When my senses returned I ran from the asylum faster than I thought possible.

So now here I sit at home on my little laptop holding my gun as closely as I can. 911 dispatch keeps brushing me off as a prank call, and I think Im going to die. But there is one thing I have that gives me confidence. I have a picture of him, and Im going to try and figure out why he doesn't want me to have it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Resubmitting because no one saw my last post and I really need help

I have a 500gb HDD in my Gaming PC I built a while back. I just bought a 120gb SSD and want to make it my boot drive.

I intend on factory resetting my current harddrive using [this method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA1LSmLwEfI). (I thought doing this was better than installing windows on the ssd because I want it blank anyway)

Then Migrate my data to my SSD using [this method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxNyDBSBNxg) and then configure it using [this method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMo8krAJd5Q).

Is this a good Idea?

The way he leaves the fiery cracks on the board when he is played is awesome.

<TEXT> My directions:

Write a program that asks the user to input:

	A sentence

	A word found in the sentence 

	Another word to replace the first word that was selected

When the New Message button is clicked, the original sentence will be displayed with the users first word replaced by the second word.

For example, if the user types Learning to write computer programs is easy. into the first textbox, then easy and challenging into the second and third textboxes, the following message will be displayed, as shown in the interface below

I was thinking of upgrading my GPU or my RAM and I don't really wanna spend more than $150

What would give me the most bang for my buck? Or do you think that saving money for steam summer sale would be a better use of my money? I can run most games a high but it cuts pretty close and with games improving so much I fear that my old PC will fall behind. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My Gaming build randomly shut down while playing BF3 and now will only turn on for a split second </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-03-07 13:23:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Specs:

-Win 7 64 bit

-gtx650 GPU

-HDD 500GB

-8GB ram

-Turbo link 500watt PSU

-AMD FX CPU

When I press the power button it will turn on my fans and LEDs for just a second then nothing. I can only do this every once and a while (after second attempt of turning it on, nothing happens, but if I wait like 10mins it can switch back on again)

I found [this](http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/345802-28-computer-turn-split) and it said it was the PSU, but I thought I would search for other opinions on reddit.

EDIT: I found this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FWXgQSokF4 about testing power supplys and wondered if it's worth trying. </TEXT>

Also if you want my opinion; you should press charges. This is a serious thing and he may likely do this to you or another female again. I don't have a full idea of the situation, but I feel you will know what to do.

and if your afraid something will happen to you, consider going to be with someone who you feel safe around.  </TEXT>

I'm cool with not maxing out games, but if there is a better graphics card of the same price I'd love some recommendations.
 I'm also looking to do some editing with special effects (it won't be a very huge thing so  I'm not looking to tilt my purchasing towards that, though I'd like to know if this would be able to handle minor editing stuff)

I do plan to throw in a SSD and a blueray writer/reader later but for now my budget isn't too huge.

I also have a friend selling me a CPU cooler. </TEXT>

You play as a soldier in a lord of the rings fight. Plain and simple. There is a story mode but it's most of the time you'd be using the custom battle type. It's for Xbox and PC. The multiplayer is fun to. It being an old game it has it's ups and downs, but what game doesn't?

<TEXT> These games look amazing and I'm tired of BS shooters like COD. So bought  Amra 2 a long time ago and never played it. 

 About 5 mins ago I traded a valuable Team Fortress 2 item for Arma 3. I don't know what to do **at all**. I wanted to ask for the advice you would have given you self when starting. (would love advice about getting into the community)


If I'm in the wrong place for posting this, please inform me. I'll delete this and move there. :) Thanks!

Edit: I tried messing around in Arma 2 with the campaign and DayZ and It was like walking through your friends house in the dark. I was to repeat my self lost. It was fun though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If anyone played the old x-men GameCube game, you may remember the part where someone hurts you so much and there is a cut scene where they speak about how you need to burn a healer mutant to kill them. Also in the newest movie he has a machine put on his heart to prevent healing.

So if he is faced against someone like the human torch or maybe a army of fire benders, he could face some real challenges.

As far as the machine thing goes in a fight that would be unrealistic. I don't think you could really pin down the metal-skeleton-mutant and put that on his heart. He also took it out on his own in the movie.  </TEXT>

When he got back after working out with a friend, he thew his bag on the bed and it collapsed. The found not one *but* 2 screw drivers left under the bed they put 2 and 2 together and decided he should wear a sling to classes the next day. The girls who pulled the prank asked what happened and he said "my bed gave out and my elbow got pinned in a weird place fracturing the bone." The girls started crying and admitting to the prank apologizing profusely. He then reached out with the "broken" are in a way you could tell it was 100% fine and said "It's okay. On the bright side I found 2 screwdrivers under my bed!"  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It can be challenging but has an awesome feel. You kinda get the ultimate spy feeling you wanted as a kid with all the cool gadgets and skills. It also has lots of cool play styles, for instance, you could sneak in and distract your enemies *or*  kill everyone using strategy *or* distract then kill and blah blah blah.

I loved it, but I'm a stealth games kinda guy. If you've got money to spend; I'd do it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I once had an appendicitis and my appendix was is a abnormal place. So when it rupture it completely popped and filled my insides with a purple goo. Plus with the fact that it was in the wrong place the doctors didn't find it for almost a month, resulting in an infection and a month in the hospital where I had 8 IV's hooked up to me and was constantly in pain

TL;DR - don't underestimate any medical condition

edit: I'm also a type 1 diabetic which further complicated things </TEXT>

2. What positions should I keep my jaw in?

3. What should be going through my head?

Please don't answer if you haven't successfully done WILD. I always seem to get answers from those people.  

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> A old age of empires-like game called Black and White 2 is awesome, you can be a evil god to your cities or a good god, you get to control the world with this big hand and it changes as you become evil or good, also the wars in the game are cool too because you can do things like throw rocks at the other armies.

Any fable game would also be a good choice, it's an RPG where you make choices that make yourself good or evil, your weapons, armour and spells depend on your good and evil traits too. You can do things like marry someone, have kids, THEN BRUTALLY MURDER THEM :D!

Lastly Just Cause 2, short description, fuck the storyline, go be a terrorist on the huge sandbox map you have to explore. You can do things like, steal a car, cover it in C4 drive it off a bridge, land on a speed boat, jump out of the car, grapple hook onto a chopper, throw out the pilot, shoot the C4 with a missle and watch the whole thing go up in flames. Plus being on PC you can mod the game and do things like give yourself unlimited ammo and invincibility!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I came into elementary school, everyone was mean to each other, it was a toddler popularity battle. So when I got to middle school, most everyone put that behind them. I didn't. I was a ass to one kid for about 1.5 years then I had a teacher who kind of became my mentor. He never knew I was a bully, But he taught me human values. I stopped being mean to him and we were kind of acquaintances. The next year in high school I said I was deeply sorry and that I knew there was no way I could fully make it up to him. He did forgive me though. After that I became SUPER sensitive to any form of bully, no to me though, to other people. I stood up for people as much as possible. Not sure if this helps, or even if this will be seen, but best description I have is ALOT of self resentment and guilt that the bully doesn't know how to deal with. </TEXT>

I'm looking to play on a BF3 graphics (high to medium) level; but I don't know what that looks like. I don't have a very large budget but I can afford this one (max about 530$ish).

I already have a copy of win7 so that's no on there for that reason. If I did this completely wrong, or there is a different better/ inexspensive part, please, do tell. Thanks for the help. :)

edit: spelling

Just because you're annoyed by someone trying to get help on a sub where that's totally welcome doesn't mean you get to be a bully and talk about how cool you are, when you say "All I do is wait it and and boooom close your eyes and think of a dream or a mirror and ENTER IT" (or whatever the hell that gibberish means.) or how you "had a Dementor from Harry Potter suck my face when I was in bed. No fucks given. Get the hell over it."

You're not some all knowing lucid dreamer, you're a bully on reddit, and you're the shit that's wrecking this sub *and* reddit as a whole. You fucking snob.

The bee is dropped from: Hunter Hellquest (easier to get, he's in the arid boneyards in that building up on posts right across from spawn, and you need to do a mission to unlock the ability to fight him)
The Impaler is dropped from: the warrior

Plus a good fire SMG will kick butt, if you do the maximum tip for moxie she'll give you one, I think. The damage is usually around 4000 and the fire rate is pretty high. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was really just an accident, I kinda gave up on lucid dreaming because I had some real life stuff to deal with, then never picked it back up.
_____________________________________________________________

So I was talking to a friend of mine from 5 years ago, after the conversation I walked into a high rise and took an elevator to what I think was my floor (the top pent house) went into the bathroom and brushed my teeth not paying attention to anything in the room caught in  thought about the conversation. I recalled the events of conversation noticing it was a dream. I followed the events up to where I was standing. i looked in the mirror and my hair was orange and i had lots of freckles ( I have no freckles and blond hair) I walked out of the bathroom into a room with a grand window. The a lady with a terrifying face burst through the door and rammed me out the window I managed to start fly and it lasted for what felt like 15 mins. I'm definatly going to keep try to lucid dream now! </TEXT>

<TITLE> I need a new method... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-08-29 14:54:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have been doing WBTB and i would wake up and not be able to fall back asleep. Then I tried WILD I slept until 3 o'clock and woke up with my alarm, no matter how hard i tried i couldn't induce sleep paralysis so I tried to go back to bed it was about 3 hours until I finally fell asleep, And after I fell asleep, I had my first lucid dream. but it didn't feel real it felt like i was playing a video game. here is how it went down. I was walking through my house and my grand-mother came up to me and said "apple pie" I noticed that didn't make any sense and looked at my hands, I had 12 fingers, so i bit one and there was no pain just numbness. I jumped up and started to fly. I broke through a wall and into my back yard, I created a house to do "stuff" inside. (I will spare you the details.) but i lost the dream and kind of woke up but drifted back into the dream and tried to bring in a famous person (wink wink) but no luck I couldn't get any thing to join my dream world not cake, nor a gun, nor a skateboard. i started losing the dream again and decided to experience what it was like to wake up (the time before I didn't pay attention I was too focused on trying not to slip out of the dream) so every thing look like i slowly closed my eyes and i woke up and had some breakfast.

TL;DR- I need some other methods can i have a good description of one that preferably doesn't involve waking up at the middle of the night?

<TEXT> I like this method because it usually only takes a quick glance. Just when ever you do your reality checks look for the rim of your glasses. Due to the fact that you do not always wear your glasses if they are not there do a different reality check. </TEXT>
