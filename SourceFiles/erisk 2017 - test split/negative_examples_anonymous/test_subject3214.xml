After we eat, we're reading love letters that we wrote each other for the occasion (her idea, but it works nicely). I'll make sure she reads hers first and the I'll read mine. I've got a nice cheesy line at the end of it that makes a nice transition to me getting down on one knee. I know she's going to say yes, but I can't shake these nerves.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The flag that was first put on top of the State House in 1962 was the Tennessee Confederate flag, which is the traditional, rectangular version we think of usually. It's well-accepted that that flag was used in defiance of the civil rights movement at the time. That flag was taken down from the State House in 2000 and the Battle Flag took it's place in front of the State House. It's only been on the grounds for about 50 years, so anyone arguing that it is a part of our state's heritage, is in denial.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If anyone wants to look up the current law regarding the flag, it's S.C. Code Ann. 1-10-10 (1976). The South Carolina General Assembly is only in session from the beginning of January to the end of June, just six months of the year. Hopefully the plan involves some kind of special session of the General Assembly to address the flag issue, otherwise any bill would have to wait to be considered until 2016. Unfortunately, that's just how the timing of this attack worked out. 

Edit: Based on Nikki Haley's speech, it looks like she'll invoke her executive powers to extend the legislative session to ensure that the flag removal legislation will make it to the floor and be voted on. 

Edit 2: 6 legislators from the South Carolina Black Caucus will be introducing a resolution to amend the General Assembly's agreement for adjournment to include debate on removing the Confederate flag from the State House grounds and to include debate on hate crime legislation. South Carolina currently has no hate crime statutes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yea the Pittsburgh interview was when Frank planned the implosion. In Chapter 10 @8:40 Peter and Frank have a heated discussion where Peter tells Frank he isn't afraid of him anymore. The Watershed Bill failed and his people need the jobs he promised them and Frank had better fix it.

The next scene is Doug and Frank discussing accelerating their unspecified plan. Peter's confidence has been built up and they're losing control of him. It's time to put him away. This is the plan to have Rachel seduce Doug the night before a radio interview and get him drunk after being sober for so long. So Frank schedules the interview and tells Peter to be ready and to go to this gala the night before. There, Rachel works her magic at the hotel, and boom goes the dynamite. 

Killing Peter was really just a spur of the moment decision by Frank. When they're in the garage, Peter is drunkenly babbling on about needing to come clean about everything that's happened. Well Frank can't have that. Peter wasn't supposed to be a liability after he withdrew from the Governor's race, but clearly he'll always be a thorn in his side. So how do we deal with a perpetual Peter problem? You put him down. Politics.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> More than anything it helped Frank look like he genuinely wanted Peter to win. Frank was the big name in the leadership who backed Peter from the get go and with the Majority Whip and his wife working so closely with him on this bill and getting it passed, people would think, "Oh wow, Underwood really believes in Russo. He really wants him to win." And as the New York Times reporter reminded us, Peter didn't have much experience backing legislation, so this would help with that. But when the bill failed, it made Peter look like less of the contender Frank wanted him to be. Fortunately, it wasn't that big of a bump in the plan. 

In Chapter 11, after Russo gave Doug the slip at the hotel, Frank chides Doug for taking his eye off of Peter. "There was a plan here, Doug. He explodes, he withdraws, we put him back together, then he quietly goes away." (@24:00).

Frank wanted Peter to look like a major contender and then once Frank orchestrates the implosion he can be like, "It's really such a shame, myself and the leadership really believed in him." Then the leadership is scrambling for a new option for Governor and Frank ever so conveniently has and idea: "Let's send Jim Matthews back to Pennsylvania, he could definitely win with only weeks before the election. Well now we need a new VP. Hmmmm... I wonder who we should choose..."

Plan executed. 8/10. -2 for Peter's sloppy "going away." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well if we looked at the date he wrote the letter to Walker, October 28th, 2014, it looks like literally one week before the real life November 4th, 2014 midterms. The problem is that we don't know the exact date that Walker resigned and when Frank took his oath and assumed office. But since there wasn't any mention of midterm results in Chapter 26, I'm sure the first episode of Season 3 will give us the results. 

Regardless, in 2016 we're going to have a situation where President Underwood would have been in office for over two years. Underwood's first "term" started late October/early November 2014. If he gets re-elected in 2016, his second term would start when he's inaugurated in January 2017. So his first term is over two years and if we use a plain meaning rule reading of the 22nd Amendment, it's seems clear that he wouldn't be able to run again in 2020.

But you can be sure he would try to get around that somehow when 2020 comes around (assuming the show is still on the air then). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I live in Hershey, PA where the Penn State Hershey Medical Center is located and includes the Children's Hospital. Families from around the country that suffer from pediatric cancer come to the Children's Hospital for care. All the money that is raised from THON is given directly to the Four Diamonds Fund which is a charitable organization that helps families pay for the entire cost of their child's cancer treatment that isn't covered by insurance. That goes for ANY child with cancer at the Children's Hospital. They provide amazing support for the families and also donate to pediatric cancer research. 

Since it started in 1973, THON has raised over $100 million for Four Diamonds. What these Penn State students do every year is amazing and so moving and the more attention THON and the Four Diamonds Fund get, the better!

If you're interested, here's the link to the THON and the Four Diamonds Fund websites where you can read up on what they do and even donate towards the total for THON 2015. FTK!!

<TEXT> After Frank saved Meechum's job and then going so far as to put him on his Secret Service detail, Frank knew he had Meechum's loyalty for good. So I don't think he was worried about Meechum ever being disloyal. During the all-nighter with Doug when Frank made the call to get Meechum's job back he knew Meechum was going to be indebted to him indefinitely. It was insurance essentially: *"It requires very little of me and will mean the world to him. It's a very inexpensive investment."*

Maybe Meechum was waiting at the top of the stairs at the station or otherwise not around to see what happened. He was never around in the same room as Frank and Zoe during their other meetings. He was probably just told to wait in the car outside the Metro stop. I think he's clever enough to have pieced together what happened but not stupid enough to express his thoughts. He knows Frank is dangerous. 

Just my thoughts, but that's how I interpreted it.  </TEXT>
