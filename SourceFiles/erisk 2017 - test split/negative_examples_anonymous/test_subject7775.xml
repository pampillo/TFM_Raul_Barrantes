<TITLE> 2 A.M Barking </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-21 14:21:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ive had insomnia almost my entire life, it is extremely difficult for me to fall asleep. But imagine insomnia mixed with the fact my neighbours have 2 dogs, very large dogs at that. Each of them looking like they weigh about 150 Kilograms each. Yeah thats how large they are. They also have a tremendously loud bark. A bark loud enough to wake a bear out of hibernation. When do you think they like to bark the most? Thats correct. 2 A.M, mixed with my insomnia, sleep barely crosses my mind, not even for a second.

I require much medication for my insomnia, prescribed by a doctor, of course. I walked down the steps in pure darkness. Dark is not a fear of mine, in fact its more of my friend as I am quite an unsocial person. I dont enjoy people, they speak and have feelings. Although, personally I am quite amazing. The cabinet where my medication is, is in the bathroom. Ive never liked the bathroom, that walls have a weird pattern that would make someone with OCD lose their mind and go mad. I take my meds at double doses, my personal idea as normal doses make me see stuff thats not there in reality.

My house has a giant forest behind it that the children in the neighbourhood enjoy playing in. Its quite dense, perfect for seclusion. That forest contains many secrets, past and present, some are mine. But thats a story for another day. The infernal dog barking causes me to have a migraine.  I head back to my small bedroom and hide myself beneath layers of blankets to try and block out the sound of the dogs barking. Its impossible, the more layers, the louder the barking.

Due to the dogs barking I dont sleep. I check the alarm clock beside my bed on the nightstand. It reads 2:31 AM. I sigh, get up and head into the study. I open up my desktop and check my Steam activity. Of course nothing I have no friends on Steam. But as usual just another trade bot messages me every 10 seconds. I shut down the computer and sit in darkness for 10 minutes.

The barking continues. I cant hold out. I have to check what this infernal barking is directed towards. I head down the same stairs and catch sight of a lone light outside the window of my house. Someone left a note, a torch and a bicycle. Here is a picture of the bike by the way http://i.imgur.com/uexqWNJ.jpg

The note reads, Happy Anniversary! This confuses me deeply as well as sparking curiosity at what the torch was pointing towards the forest. Its not the perfect weather or time for a forest stroll, but I have nothing else to do. I head down a steep hill, there is a single set of footprints that go from my position to a cave carved into the side of a hill near a drain pipe.

I shine my torch into the drain pipe and see nothing out of the ordinary. I flash my torch into the cave. I catch a whiff of a foul odour being emitted from something or someone from the cave. I move away all of the foliage covering my entrance to the cave. I put down my torch.

I point it inwards into the cave.

I see the remains of a decaying human skeleton

Hey Dan I whisper. Happy Anniversary!

<TEXT> I believe Abel would only have to wield the weight. As Gemma said in one scene, Abel was going to be a son, Thomas was going to be different. In one of the last scenes, Abel is seen playing with the 'Son' ring given to him by Gemma the episode before. So my theory is Abel grew up to follow in Jax's footsteps, and basically the story repeats. You might never know, Wendy could of came back, married a Son then Thomas could've died. The story could basically repeat itself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No the Reaper is the homeless lady. She tells Jax "It's time" right before he kills August Marks. I believe Jax was supposed to represent Jesus, the food the homeless lady was eating was bread, aswell as drinking wine. This represents the last supper as 2 items present at the the table. Then after Jax collides with the truck we see 2 crows pecking at a piece of bread on the side of the road, we then hear the collision confirming Jax's death. The crows fly away, Jax's blood touches the bread. It was Jax's last supper. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Ice Cream Man </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-07 07:51:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So back along time ago when I was young around the age of 8 or 7. I was a really intelligent child, but I was also athletic so I played alot of sports. So one day I decided to go down and meet some of my friends at the basketball court near my house. It was a short walk I went down the street, took a right, then a left and I was there.


Except, this day was different when I was on the way there. I was stopped by the sound of the Ice Cream Truck's music. I took a look over my shoulder and saw a car following up behind it looked similar to this: [This](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Volvo343DL1980.jpg)


I took a closer look but it was still far away, I was trying to get a glimpse of the driver. I saw his face and some of his details he had a huge nose, a fairly sized mouth but his eyes were terrifying to my 8 year old self for some reason.


He pulled up right next to me looked at me and said "Would you like some of my Ice Cream?" He was fairly tall to be driving that car so he looked quite squashed inside. I was warned of stranger danger constantly so I knew to walk faster and faster.


He followed me for a good 2 minutes, every 5 seconds his questions turned into shouts. He saw a car coming up the road then shouted at me. "I know where you live, and I'll be back!" I quickly turned around and ran back for my house and when I got back, I locked the door behind me and peaked through the blinds. Luckily he didn't follow me.


There was one small detail I didn't realise about this event because I was 8 years old, he was furiously masturbating in the front, and I no longer wish to know what he meant by "Ice Cream".


The reason I posted this is because I am now 17, and his car just pulled up in my driveway... **Please help me...** </TEXT>

<TEXT> **A Way for Fitting Weapons into Your Backpack**

 nbsp;

Storing Weapons in your backpack can be a real big hassle due to the only way of storing it in there, is sideways. Although, if most of us were to store a weapon in a backpack in real life, we would do it facing up, right? So why not do that in DayZ. Make weapons take up the same amount of space, but let them face upwards. I thought of this because most weapons can not be stored in backpacks as the backpack's space in the inventory does not have a big enough width.

 nbsp;

Thank you to anyone who reads this, and have a great day! </TEXT>

There is a program open, may be Task Manager due to it saying "Processes" in the program, but the reason it is strange to me, is that there is an error.  </TEXT>

I am trying to make an insertion in a blackhawk, except when it lands, it only ejects me and not the rest of my squad. The squad is grouped to the player, but the player isn't grouped to the chopper. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **How often do you visit and participate on this subreddit? Are there any factors that would affect your participation?**

Answer: I am quite new to the Day Z subreddit, but during the day I will take a quick look at the subreddit, but then at one point in the day I will look through most of the day's new posts, and see if there are any new "Hot" ones.

**Is there anything on the subreddit would you like to be involved with in particular? Contests and events? Weekly thread maintenance? Helping style the CSS? Other?**

   Answer: I am quite familiar with Cascading Style Sheet, so of course I would appreciate helping out with the      styling of the subreddit. It would also be my pleasure to help out with the weekly thread maintenance.

**Are there any concerns with the subreddit right now that you would tackle as a Moderator? What are they, and how would you go about addressing them?**

   Answer: One of my main concerns for the subreddit right now, would be the amount of content surronding the hackers of DayZ and how so many people in the subreddit spend most of their time complaining about them. I would like to keep the subreddit mostly positive and focus on the good things about DayZ and it's development.

**Do you have any new suggestions for current moderation standards, new weekly threads, or other improvements? Yes or no will suffice here, we're not here to steal your ideas (unless you want to share them anyway, that's cool too)!**

   Answer: Twitter updates from the developers is one of the most important updates that are released on the subreddit because that is our main source of information, so I would suggest moderators keep a close eye upon the twitter feed of the developers.

**Despite best intentions and efforts, there will always be users who will criticize your actions, make false accusations, or otherwise put you down. How have you dealt with discontent, disapproval, or disagreement in the past, and how are you prepared to handle this criticism in a position of power?**

   Answer: Criticism is a standard within the gaming community, most of us deal with it everyday, to me it has no negative effect, sometimes criticism can make us more open minded, and appreciate other people's opinions more than before, when I have dealt with criticism I try and stay positive with it, although most of the time within gaming criticism is an attempt to put other gamers down. I am prepared to handle criticism without responding with criticism, so not to feed the person.

**Why do you want to be a Moderator?**

   Answer: I want to be a moderator because the Day Z subreddit is a fantastic community where users can share their opinions and creativity. So I would love to let the creativity continue, and make it easy for DayZ players to share their screenshots, recordings, ect.

**Do you have any prior moderation experience on reddit?**

   Answer: I have had no past experience with moderation on reddit.

**When did you join r/DayZ? What is your in-game experience like?**

   Answer: About a week ago, my first post received criticism upon the fact many people believed I used MS paint to stretch out my image to attempt to make the aspect ratio seems like 16:9 but the community has been welcoming else where. My gaming experience within Day Z so far has been trying to help other players, but always being blind sided by them players.

Thank you for reading this application.

Did you know whining on the subreddit won't get hackers stopped anytime soon? How about you write some code that can stop hackers, send it to the developers and leave a little "Your Welcome" note with it. GG no re.  </TEXT>
