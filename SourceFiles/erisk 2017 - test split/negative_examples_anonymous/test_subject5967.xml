<TEXT> At our store, we're more concerned about a candidate's ability to drive sales, get along with coworkers and provide good customer service to our customers than we are about their knowledge of books. Our interview questions generally begin with, "Describe a time when..." We carry 2 million titles in the store, so even the most voracious reader won't be very familiar with the vast majority of what we sell. We're looking for team players who are friendly to customers and don't shy away from the selling aspect of the job (we are there to make money, after all). Good luck!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Idea: Instead of writing letters to the editors of our local papers, why don't we write them to papers in Iowa? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-09 08:41:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm sure many of you either participated in or at least saw the Facebook event last Saturday for a letter writing campaign. The goal was to get as many Bernie supporters as possible to write a letter to the editor of their local paper stating why they support him for president. This was a fun and quick (most newspapers have a 200 word limit) way to potentially reach a lot of people. 


Why don't we do the same thing, but send the letters to various papers in Iowa? I guess the letters are supposed to be submitted by locals, but I don't think that's a requirement. Imagine if, this Sunday, every newspaper in Iowa has at least one letter to the editor in support of Bernie Sanders. That could potentially make a difference in the race.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The book is called *[The Speech]( http://www.amazon.com/Speech-Historic-Filibuster-Corporate-Decline/dp/1568586841/ref=sr_1_1?s=books amp;amp;amp;amp;ie=UTF8 amp;amp;amp;amp;qid=1436225392 amp;amp;amp;amp;sr=1-1 amp;amp;amp;amp;keywords=the+speech amp;amp;amp;amp;pebp=1436225399941 amp;amp;amp;amp;perid=07DT3YP2MBYN1BBA8K1T#featureBulletsAndDetailBullets_secondary_view_div_1436226426666)* and is the publication of an 8 hour long filibuster Senator Sanders gave on the Senate floor regarding the extension of the Bush tax cuts in 2010. 


The book is less than $10 and **all authorial proceeds are donated to charity**. Consider it your good deed for the day AND you get an excellent book out of it. 


Also, I can't confirm this, but another user mentioned that putting the book in your cart will raise its rank on Amazon even if you don't buy it. 


Lastly, Bernie has another book called *[Outsider in the House](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/1859841775/ref=pd_aw_sbs_14_4?refRID=12267PXWT3J0095Q5C2P)*, currently #924,515 on Amazon, although it appears to be out of print.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You've already received some good answers, but I want to provide another perspective. Look at [this chart]( https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2delGcbK8FF7ck_fgtGWaA1iE5c=/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3657424/bernie_hillary_donations.png) showing who the largest donors to Hillary and Bernie are throughout their careers. You'll notice that Hillary receives most of her money from large corporations like Citigroup, Goldman Sachs JPMorganchase, and Lehman Brothers. In fact, almost every donor on the list is a major corporation. Compare that list to the list of Bernie's donors, which are almost all worker's unions. 


Organizations donate to political campaigns as an investment. They think the rewards they get from having their candidate elected will be greater than their initial investment. Now I don't know your situation, but I would guess that you, as I and most Americans do, would benefit more from the success of laborers, engineers, teachers and machinists than you would from the success of Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. 


If you want to know who a politician will be loyal to, just look at who their major donors are.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good idea trying to get it stickied. We have 55,000 subscribers here. If we can get just 10,000 of those people to use #Bernie2016 on Instagram or other social media outlets at 3:00 EST on Sunday it won't go unnoticed. Try messaging the mods about it. 

My advice is to only ask people to use one hashtag and to make it #Bernie2016. People will throw in other hashtags that they like, but #Bernie2016 is simple an it gets our message across.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> One of the biggest problems we face is the lack of media coverage. Writing letters to the media will go a long way in resolving this, but it's also important that we thank those websites that do cover Bernie by giving them their clicks. At the end of the day, websites are trying to get views and they will notice if they get an abnormally high number of views every time they post a Bernie story. When this happens, we can expect to see more coverage. So, don't just read the headlines on the front page. Actually visit the website; comment if you have the time. Make it a smart business decision for websites to cover the campaign.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would say 33% on July 2 puts us ahead of schedule. Most of us expect, reasonably I would say, to get another bump in the polls once the debates start. There's also the fact that Biden, who has shown no signs of running is at 7%. Who are those 7%? Could they be polling for Biden as an anti-Hillary protest. I suspect that those 7% could easily switch to Bernie supporters, assuming Biden doesn't jump into the race late.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's mine: short and sweet.


 Good afternoon,


Due to a prior commitment, I was unable to watch the live stream of Bernie Sanders' campaign rally in Madison last night. I figured I would still be able to read about it this morning in the NYT. Disappointinly, there wasn't a single mention of the event in today's paper. This is shocking because an estimated 10,000 people attended the rally, making it the largest campaign event for any candidate this election season. Senator Sanders is rising in the polls and is making the race for the Democratic Party nomination very interesting. In the future, please provide some form of coverage of rallies that draw crowds this large, for any candidate. It's a noteworthy achievement and a possible indicator of an exciting race this year.



Thank you,

<TEXT> I haven't found a "real" job yet, although I haven't seriously looked. I'm still working the same retail job I started when I was 18. I was recently promoted to a lead position and I have an interview this week for a manager position. I don't want to make a long term career out of this job, but I figure it can't hurt to be able to put "manager" on future resumes. 


In the meantime, what can I do to make myself a desirable applicant in the future? The problem is I don't know what I want to do, so I can't tailor my skill set to my dream job. What are the skills I should teach myself or experience I should get if my goal is to land a 30k+ job within one year? 


I apologize if this question gets asked a lot, which I assume it does. I'm new to this subreddit and I really appreciate your help.  </TEXT>

[Combo #1](http://imgur.com/j1HnoRF) (Gingham shirt, knit skinny tie)


[Combo #2](http://imgur.com/75HJB11) (Solid white shirt, floral skinny tie)


[Combo #3](http://imgur.com/Z3HGqV6) (Solid white shirt, stripped knit tie)



All three seem a little off to me, but I can't quite put my finger on why. Maybe it's just because I'm not used to seeing it.  </TEXT>

He was standing at third starring absent mindedly at the Giants bullpen. Romo gave him a smile and a wave and then Turner pretended to bite his nails like he was nervous. They got a chuckle out of it and I thought some of you might too.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Haha yesterday was my first time at a sports book and I was confused by both of those things. You give them the rotation number and they give you cash when you cash out. The woman took my tickets, went to the back where I assume there's some kind of machine that separates the winners from the losers and tells her how much to pay me. She came back and gave me the cash. 


I was and still am confused when betting spreads. Last night I picked 1234, or whatever the rotation number of the Pelicans, to cover. I just said, "1234 to cover." Is that correct or should I have said something else?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Before each game, each team gives the referees 12 footballs. The Patriots use their 12 and the Colts use their 12, so each team uses different balls. An underinflated ball, while harder to throw a long ways, is easier to catch. It's easier to grip a ball that is underinflated and it will be less likely to bounce off of a receiver's pads.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is an outstanding comment. It's interesting that great movies like *Hotel Rwanda* and *Million Dollar Baby* aren't talked about as much as films like *Team America* and *Anchorman*, which are both, and I say this affectionately, stupid movies. 


Another interesting point you made is that children's movies seem to be talked about more. I think the question that neither you or OP asked is: Who is talking about these movies? Since most of Reddit tends to be in the 18-30 age range, it's not surprising that we still talk about the movies we liked when we were kids. *The Incredibles* still gets talked about, but is that because it's a great film or is it because we loved it when we were 12? My guess is that if Reddit had as many 30-40 year olds as it does 18-30 year olds, *The Incredibles* would not be mentioned as much as a film that that generation grew up with, *The Little Mermaid* for example. In 10 years, Redditors will probably talk about *Frozen* the same way we talk about *The Incredibles*.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This album was my introduction to Prince and after listening to it in its entirety, I wasn't impressed. I thought the vocals weren't loud enough and I couldn't make out what he was saying. But since it was the album that made Prince a star, I stuck with it and listened a few more times.


After a few listens, I fell in love with it. I live the catchiness, especially of the first two songs, *Dirty Mind* and *When you were Mine*, I love the thinly veiled (maybe blatant would be more accurate) sexual innuendo in the lyrics, and I even love Prince's high pitched vocals.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really want to hear an explanation from Pete and Vivek. If they have someone like Karl or JVG linned up, then I won't be upset. If this firing is a result of Malone not living up to expectations, then this firing is outrageous. Look at this roster and tell me with a straight face that it's underachieving. Our best player has missed the last 8 games and we're still less than 2 games out of the 8th spot. I don't think there's a Kings fan alive who isn't pleased with the team's performance this year.


If Malone was fired because we weren't playing the ultempo style Vivek wants to see, then Vivek needs to go. It's about winning games, which we were doing for the first time in 8 years. Style counts for nothing.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is my biggest complaint about MFA, which is still one of my favorite subreddits. I see students asking for advice all the time and it never fails that people suggest the stereotypical MFA uniform. While an OCBD, dark cuffed denim and Allen Edmonds look nice, they're way out of place on a college campus, let alone high school. 


Someone once told me to dress 10% better than the average guy. That way, you look better, but don't stick out like a sore thumb. Given that I went to a university in southern California where the average guy wore a tank top, basketball shorts and flip flops, that wasn't hard. 


To me, dressing well is a combination of looking nice without looking out of place. There's a time and a place for the MFA uniform, but 11th grade isn't it. To be fair, it seems like this is less of an issue now than it was a year ago, but it's a beef I've always had with MFA. 


Sorry for the anti-MFA-circlejerk-circlejerk. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The best one I've made is buffalo chicken. I cook about 1.5 pounds of chicken covered in a bottle of buffalo sauce and dry ranch dressing mix on low for 7-8 hours. Then I just shred it and eat it on a sandwich roll, usually with some broccoli on the side and milk to drink. It's delicious. 

I'm all about simplicity, so if a recipe has more than about 3 ingredients, I probably won't try it. Sometimes I'll just cook chicken breasts in water, shred them, and then mix it with brown rice. Chicken can also be slow cooked in beer, which gives it a different flavor. Check out /r/slowcooking for more recipes. They're a little more adventurous than me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For the most part. I bought a slow cooker and I cook a ton of chicken in that. I also cook a lot of rice. If I cook 2 cups of rice and 1.5 pounds of chicken, I can get about 3 meals out of that, which I refrigerate and eat over 2-3 days. 

I also make breakfast burritos with eggs, hash browns and sausage. They're delicious, inexpensive and if I eat 2 of them and a glass of milk in one sitting, it's over 1000 calories. I only make about 8 at a time with 10 eggs, but I've seen guys prepare them by the dozen using 40+ eggs. Just wrap them in a paper towel and put them in Tupperware.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ever since I started paying for Spotify, I've been listening to full albums while I lift. It's like killing two birds with one stone since otherwise I would just sit on my ass in my room and listen. I've been going through the White Stripes' catalogue recently. I think their self titled album and White Blood Cells are my favorite to lift to. 


If you like Hash Pipe, give their album Pinkerton a listen. It's my favorite Weezer album. I also keep going back to a band called Battleme. They're just the right pace for me to lift to. 


I also made [this playlist]( http://open.spotify.com/user/swolebuddha/playlist/1gQZicqZROQnFYsbQO0Zp7) of movie scores a while ago. It's good for when you want to feel like Batman while you lift. </TEXT>

I did my best to recreate the recipe based on what she told me and it turned out pretty darn good.


Boil 2 cups of macaroni in salted water (grandma insisted that the water be salted)


In a baking dish, mix macaroni with approx. 1 cup of cheese. I used sharp cheddar.


Add 1/2 cup of milk

Bake for 10 minutes at 350 degrees, stir, then bake for 10 more minutes. </TEXT>

Put the chicken in the slow cooker, pour the bottle of buffalo wing sauce on the chicken and then sprinkle the ranch mix on top. Cook on high for 4-5 hours, then shred with a fork.


Next time I make this, I'll probably use less buffalo wing sauce, maybe 3/4 of a bottle.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm trying to prepare meals in advance and I also just bought a slow cooker. Yesterday I made chicken breasts and put them in burritos. It was delicious, so I wanted to share the recipe.


Place chicken breasts in slow cooker.

Add one 12 oz bottle of beer. I used Stella, but anything should work.

1/2 tsp of paprika

1/2 tsp of basil

1/2 tsp of garlic powder

1/2 tsp of salt

1/2 tsp if black pepper


Cook it on low for 7-8 hours and then use a fork to shred it. From there, you can do all kinds of stuff with it. I just made burritos with beans and cheese.


If you're like me, simplicity is the most important thing in a recipe. If something takes more than a handful of ingredients, I'm not going to make it. You could easily do this with just beer and chicken.  </TEXT>

This is right by my house and I went to high school at Placer, so I know the area well. The neighborhood behind the school has narrow streets with a lot of trees. It would be very hard to spot a suspect from a helicopter. Past the homes is the American River Canyon. This is really rocky terrain that would be difficult to maneuver quickly. However, large portions of the area do not have trees due to the once planned construction of a dam. If he wanders into this area, it would be game over. Crossing the river would be nearly impossible without being spotted by one of the helicopters.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Brothers, I come to you in a fit of rage. I had heard the fables, but until this morning I had never personally encountered a gains thief. 



I was doing warm up sets of deadlifts, hopefully working up to a new PR. When I sat down to rest between sets, some jerk comes up, doesn't say a word to me, and takes over my barbell. I'm sitting just a few feet away when this gains hog thinks he can just overtake my setup. He was pretty big, built more like a powerlifter with significant body fat, but also very strong. I was dumbfounded. So speechless I couldn't even stand up for myself. I just sat there, mouth agape and watched as this guy took the gains that rightfully belonged to me. I managed to take a picture of the guy. Hopefully he sees this and realize what a punk he is.

<TITLE> Let's talk: Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga -- "Cheek to Cheek" </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-15 23:07:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is an album that I normally would never listen today, but I work in a store that sells CDs and quite a few people have been buying this lately. This morning, we played it at the store and I like what I heard, so I listened to it more closely when I got home from work. I have to say, it blew me away. 


While it definitely sounds more like a Tony Bennett album than a Lady Gaga album, Gaga knocks it out of the park. Her voice is a natural fit for this genre of music. In fact, she blows Tony Bennett out of the water. 


When I played this album, I couldn't help but imagine myself in a 1950s club, sitting at a table with a cigar and a glass of scotch...wearing a silk robe, while Bennett, Gaga and their band do their thing on stage. Even if this isn't your usual genre, it wasn't mine, give the album a spin because it truly is outstanding.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So 4th and goal from inside the 2. We opt to go for the TD and put the game away rather than make it a 13 point game and force their rookie QB to lead two touchdown drives.


4th and 1 near the STL 40 yard line. We opt to go for it rather than punt and pin the Rams inside their own 15. Instead, the Rams, who need a TD and a field goal to tie the game, only need to drive about 25 yards to get into field goal range. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've never had much luck with parlay bets, especially in football where upsets are fairly common, but they sure are exciting! I usually only do parlays when there are two events that are near sure things. You can usually find them in the early rounds of tennis tournaments when two top seeds are playing unknowns or in Champions League soccer when a great team is playing a team from a much smaller league. For football, I usually stick to single bets. If there are two games that I feel especially confident in, I will parlay the money lines.  </TEXT>

I'm assuming you know what a parlay bet is, but if you don't, it's a single bet on multiple events. In this case, if the Packers win by 3.5 or more points and the Patriots win by more than three, you win. If either outcome does not occur, you lose. It seems like a reasonable bet to me. 


The -105 is referring to the odds that the Packers will win by 3.5 points or more. It's just a way for you to be able to quickly calculate about how much your return on the bet would be. The minus sign means the outcome is favored to happen. The higher the number is above 100, the more heavily favored it is. When dealing with points spreads, the odds are usually right around 100, meaning your profit will be slightly less than your original bet. If the odds say "Even", you will win exactly what you bet. If there is a plus sign in font of the odds, the event is not expected to happen. If something has odds of +115, it means you would win $115 on a $100 bet.

<TEXT> I'm betting on a lot of baseball games on Thursday, it's hard to pick just one potd. I'll go with the **Giants/Padres under 6.5**. The Giants have not been hitting the ball well lately and the Padres haven't hit the ball well all year. On top of that, Andrew Cashner is pitching for San Diego. He shut down SF last week. Yusmeiro Petit has been one of the most consistent pitchers for the Giants over the last month and a half. 


My other picks for the day are **DET ML**, **MIL ML**, **WAS ML** and, **TB/BOS over 8.5**. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the last week, the only two Giants hitters who have shown any consistency are Gregor Blanco and Joe Panik. Posey, Sandoval, Pence, Belt, Crawford and Perez look lost. 


Edit: I considered the over 6. Hudson's last start against LA he didn't retire a batter in the second inning. He looked bad against the Padres last time out too. The problem I have with the over 6 is that he's going to be on a short leash. He won't be in the game long enough to allow 6 runs. On top of that, Kershaw is pitching for LA.



Edit: Decided to parlay Dodgers ML and over 6.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Am I crazy or does Carl Crawford get an usual number of rest days? Is there a reason for that? He's on fire this month, but it seems like he's out of the lineup for half of the Dodgers game I've watched recently.  </TEXT>

I also like the **under 6** on the **Dodgers/Giants** game. Bumgarner has absolute ownage against the Dodgers in his career. Greinke is pitching for LA and the Giants haven't been hitting lately. It might also be worth putting a unit on the Giants ML. They're underdogs, but I think there's good value there.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got tired of my usual workout music. I had always been a fan of certain songs on The Dark Knight Rises score because they made made feel like Batman training in a prison cell, so I set out to find equally motivating music. I took mainly from the work of Hans Zimmer (TDKR, TDK, Pirates of the Caribbean, Gladiator, Man of Steel, Inception, The Lone Ranger), but there are a few other artists in the playlist. It's mostly upbeat, but has the occasional slower pace, which makes the eventual build up even more epic and motivational. 



Give it a listen and let me know what you think. Tell me if there's a song I should add to or remove from the list. I'm by no means knowledgeable about this kind of music, so I'm sure there are plenty of awesome songs that I don't know about. 



[Here is the finished product]( http://open.spotify.com/user/swolebuddha/playlist/1gQZicqZROQnFYsbQO0Zp7). I hope it serves you well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depends on what you want to do. For night life, the Gas Lamp, Pacific Beach and North Park are the main spots. The Gas Lamp is even cool during the day and it's within walking distance of PetCo. At night, it's a little showy, but a lot of fun. The trolley runs there, but it stops around 11:30. Pacific Beach is great at night too. It attracts a younger crowd, a lot of bros and hoes. Cabo Cantina will have more 21 year old girls than you'll ever see again in your life. You have to drive there though. North Park is the most laid back spot. It has a super hipster vibe. If you go here, be sure to check out Seven Grand and True North Tavern. 


During the day, I recommend visiting a brewery. San Diego has Stone, Green Flash, Mission, Ballast Point and a few others that I can't think of. I recommend Mission. Their Shipwreck IIPA is one of my favorite beers ever. Plus, you can take the trolley to 12th   Imperial, walk there and then either walk or trolley to the game.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The biggest surprise of the address for me was the way the president talked about the Assad regime. He said the regime will never regain the legitimacy that they have lost. I don't necessarily disagree with that, but I'm surprised to hear the president write the regime off as a potential ally against ISIS.

Assad is in control of an entire air force, and what seems to be a more organized military than the rebels. I would not have been shocked to see the US reluctantly side with Assad in exchange for his assistance in going after ISIS. The language the President used tonight rules that possibility out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know, I know I hate posts here where OP makes excuses too.

I'm staying at my parents' house for a few months. My dad has a bench. So, I can do bench, DLs, rows. He also has dumbbells and a pullup bar, so I can do dumbbell press and pullups. Everything I need to build a strong upper body is there. The problem is, he doesn't have a way to safely squat. The only thing he has for lower body is a leg extension/leg curl machine attached to the bench. 

What kind of results can I expect to my lower body if I combine that with dumbbel lunges? Are there any other lower body exercises I can do with the equipment I have?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm constantly wondering how I'm going to get my next meal. I wake up in the morning and I try to remember how much food is in the house. How much milk do I have and is it enough to make it through the day? When will I find time to go to the store today to get more milk for tomorrow? Did I remember to wash my blender last night? Is today lifting day? I think about how many calories I need to have consumed by the time I leave for work, because I know I will be too tired to cook a big meal when I come home. I don't want to be hungry at work, but I also don't want protein farts. I lay in bed browsing reddit on my phone, but I know I should be eating.

If I start to feel hungry at work, I fret over the gains I'm losing. I count the minutes until I can take my break and find some food. But I only have 15 minutes. I run to Starbucks and hope they have breakfast sandwiches left. That will have to hold me over for the rest of my shift. 


I come home feeling tired, but I can't go to bed until I hit my caloric goal. I debate whether I have the energy to cook a full meal or if I should just piece away at some milk and snacks for a bit. I choose the latter. I hit my goal for the day, but at what cost? I now have almost nothing left for the following day. If today was a struggle, tomorrow will only be harder. I look at my shirtless body in the mirror as I brush my teeth. I'm tired and bloated, but goddammit if I don't look bigger. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Brothers and sisters in swole, like many of you, I didn't think it could happen to me. I read your stories of swolestation and felt the same rage you felt, but I thought I was safe. Surely those around me appreciate me for my personality, I believed. Yet, yesterday, at my own place of employment no less, I was used like some piece of farm equipment.

I'm relatively new to the Iron Path, but Brodin has been very good to me. I've noticed the stealthy glances of passersby as they 'mire my aesthetics, but I can take that because I also consider myself swole of spirit. But what happened yesterday was more than I can bare.

My work has conducted a food drive over the last two months to collect food for the less fortunate. I was extra motivated, as I saw this as an opportunity to give the aspiring followers of Brodin the fuel they need to make mad gains. Our store was very successful in our efforts and yesterday, we finally delivered the boxes of food to the food closet on the other side of town. There were dozens of boxes, many filled with canned goods. 

Without warning or asking me if I wanted to help, my boss informed me yesterday that she "needed my muscles" to help her deliver the food. I was dumbfounded. I've always tried to be the best employee I could be, but suddenly I found myself as nothing more than a tool to help move nonperishable food items. I have never felt so objectified. 

I sat in silence next to my boss on the car ride over as I tried my best to contain my tears. When we finally arrived, I did my best to deliver the boxes as quickly as possible so I could return to work and have a good think in the break room. As soon as the last box was set down, the food closet manager said perkily, "We sure are lucky to have you. Otherwise we would have been moving boxes all afternoon." Do you believe the nerve? She didn't even consider the possibility that the previous day was deadlift day and maybe lifting heavy boxes off the ground wasn't ideal for me. 

I'm at a loss, reddit. I thought my place of employment was my sanctuary. What should I do? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not the most devout worshipper of Brodin, but I have paid my dues at the Iron Temple regularly this year, and have been blessed with righteous gains. I've been swolested on a couple of occasions, but I forgive those people, for they know not the error of their ways. The pain that their actions caused me was erased after an experience yesterday at work.


An unruly customer, neither swole of body or mind, threatened my boss after she banned him from the store. This was the third time she has had to ask him to leave and each time he has made a scene while exiting. Unfortunately, I was not present to witness the events as they happened that day, but they worried my boss. As the day went on and she resumed normal work activity, she needed to go to her car to get something. Although I was the youngest man working that day, it was me she asked to walk with her for protection. Brodin gave me this opportunity to use my gains for good. I escorted her to and from her car without incident. Although my presence was unnecessary, it felt good to be asked to provide protection. </TEXT>
