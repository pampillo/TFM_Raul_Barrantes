<TEXT>  144 deaths, 1,391 injuries and 8,061 device malfunctions were recorded out of a total of more than 1.7 million robotic procedures carried out between January 2000 and December 2013.

That's less than a 0.1% failure rate on robotic surgeries (factoring in deaths and injuries, but not device malfunctions). I'd be curious to learn what the comparable rate is for human surgeons. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, that's a fair assessment. I think most of those breeds do fall under or near 50 lbs, but it's definitely important to consider living situations (like you mentioned, stairs, etc.) :)

I would say this is just a starting point, not every dog here will be great in every situation...I think it's important to do a good bit of research on your intended dog type. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While your dismissive and critical tone doesn't warrant a gracious response, here are my thoughts anyway:

You're incorrect about the Boxers needs. It's generally recommended for Boxers to receive 45-60 minutes of exercise a day (more is always better of course). [[1]](http://www.allboxerinfo.com/boxer-dog-exercise) [[2]](http://www.atlantaboxerrescue.org/exercise.html)

I never said **all** of those breeds have **all** of those characteristics. It's a wide mix of dogs that in some way or another have some suitability for a young adult. I think the linked videos give a great breakdown of each breed, so you can learn about the tradeoffs there.

I never claimed to be an expert. If you're an expert, good for you, you're allowed to dissent. My recommendation would be to do so more cordially in the future. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While of course differing in looks/size, the breeds listed are similar in that they fit into some of the following categories: "friendly, easily trained, less vocal pooches with moderate activity needs".

Think of them as dogs that are lower down on the "maintenance requirements" list. I think the author's goal was to offer a widely varying selection of breeds :) </TEXT>

"Timeout in transmission from localhost"
"Timeout in communication with remote server"

All other webpages work just fine. I'm only having this issue with WebGoat on localhost. My configurations are below:

- WebGoat is running on localhost:8080
- Burp Proxy is configured to listen on 127.0.0.1:8081
- Firefox is configured to use the Burp proxy.

I've spent several hours Googling and tweaking the configurations, but I have not been able to get it to work. Any help would be appreciated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gotcha. So, by not vaccinating, you not only put yourself at risk, but everyone around you, and you do all of this for a weak "maybe" of a risk.

Doesn't seem worth it at all. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My parents are anti-vaccinations, and I've been trying to educate myself on the matter so that I could address and potentially counter their concerns knowledgeably.

I know Reddit is quite pro-vaccine, and I hear all the time about the flawed and debunked autism-vaccine study. I watch Penn and Teller's Bullshit episode on vaccines, and I see people "poo-poo" any casual connection between vaccines and autism.

But then I come across a site like [this](http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2007/06/no-evidence-of-any-link.html), and I become confused. It appears to be heavily cited, with over 60 papers and studies that present a connection between various types of vaccines and ADS (austism spectrum disorder).

There seems to be misinformation on this topic everywhere, and it can get a little overwhelming. Reddit, can you help me sort out fact from fiction, speculation from science?

*EDIT* Whoops, forgot to include link

<TEXT> I understand, but even if we assume that one is completely safe (which isn't the case) that's only a single vaccine. There are studies linking autism to the Hepatitis B Vaccination, for example.

I guess I'm just wondering if vaccination simply becomes a question of risk tolerance? "Am I okay with with the rare but possible side effects of this vaccination?" </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was homeschooled K-12.  My last two years of high school I dual-enrolled at a community college.  This enabled me to transfer in as a sophomore right out of highschool.  I got my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering in 3 years, and I my Master's in Computer Networking in 4, all with a 3.75+ GPA.

Thanks Mom and Dad for homeschooling me! </TEXT>

<TITLE> How To Make Old People Laugh... </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey Reddit,
My community holds a "Senior Breakfast" for the elderly folk in the area a couple times every year.  For the next one, I've been asked to do some form of humorous entertainment (nothing too lengthy maybe 5-10min).  Now I've done some standup before, but not with this specific demographic as my audience.  So my question is, what do you think the seniors today would find funny?

Feel free to recommend specific jokes, online resources, etc.  Your thoughts are much appreciated! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Yes I Will Fix Your Computer...Maybe. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2009-11-03 17:12:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A friend asked for help "fixing" their computer.  They claim that IE won't close properly and they can't open Trend Micro.

I was thinking I would run some antivirus/antispyware scans (AVG?), and I'm definitely going to install Firefox and plead with her to use that instead.

But I'm not especially adept at troubleshooting computers, and without more details, it's hard for me to know exactly what the problem is.  I'll be going to her place tomorrow to try and help, and I was wondering if the brilliance here at reddit has some suggestions for how I should proceed. </TEXT>
