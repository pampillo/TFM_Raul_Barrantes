<TEXT>  I guess I'm worried that I'll make this choice, and then regret it. Or not do it and never be happy...

ah, the eternal dilemma of a trans person. damned if you do, damned if you dont. that's something i struggled with for the better part of 30 years (i've known since i was 7, came out when i was 39)

i dont have much to offer, except that as much as i pushed it away, and LORD knows i tried my hardest, it always came back with a vengeance. i just ran out of energy to fight it, and gave into the NEED to be a girl.

i'm much happier now, but i had to go thru a whole lot of shit to figure that out. i envy the kids who just know, and fight like hell to come out. 

 HUG 

i dont envy you the choice you have to make, and i wish i could offer more advice than "i'm sending positive vibes". but that's part of the journey that each of us has to figure out on our own. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pride right now, for a lot of us, is a celebration of us surviving coming out of the closet. let the haters hate. we'll have the twinks in codpieces hanging from the sides of floats. we'll have the drag queens standing 7 feet tall with their beehive hairdos and sequined ball gowns. we'll have the big hairy bears holding hands in their leather harnesses. 

as much as queer culture has been assimilating into the mainstream, there will always be that element that  sets us apart. that comes from being a part of a minority, we will always be "different" than other people. and there's nothing wrong with that. it's perfectly normal for us.

and i'll leave you with Nomi's Pride speech from Sense8 because i havent heard a better one yet.

ONLY because it's better to transition under medical supervision. that being said, i also know MANY trans people who dont have access to a doctor to transition and who have gone down the road of DIY. they know the risks they're taking, and i will assume that you do too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> oh they're completely disgusting, ANYONE who would use brennan as a spokesperson loses any and all credibility with me.

i'm just saying that there ARE people who detransition, and their trans journey is just as valid as ours. 

The problem here is that Cummings and Lopez are trying to impose THEIR outlook as the only one true way. I'm sure it seems that way to them, but it's wrong. wrong in every way it can possibly be. </TEXT>

<TEXT> lmao, the f-35 is the most expensive boondoggle in history. at this point, it's the poster child for a solution in search of a problem, because it doesnt fit any role for any aircraft in the current theater of operations. 

it may very well be a jack of all trades, but it is currently a master of none, so all the specialized aircraft currently deployed will run rings around it for their purpose. 

gimme a warthog any day of the week. </TEXT>

<TEXT> i was a crazy person the first 6 months. then i was an emotional wreck for the next 6. i'm amazed that any of my friends stuck around. 2nd puberty is a royal bitch and a half. there were times i was so uncomfortable with my image in the  mirror that i spent days avoiding my reflection. without my therapist, i would have gone stark raving bonkers. it didnt help that i went fulltime 2 months into hrt. hell, i didnt start hrt til two months after i got my script. 

seriously, your reaction is pretty much well within the bounds of transition. keep a record for your timeline, you'll see the diff. 

 HUG

<TEXT> let's take it from the top, shall we?

someone's sexuality is literally none of your goddamn business. if they want to serve their country by joining up, then more power to them. YOU  do not get a say. 

end of story. there's no big discussion to be had. sexuality has nothing to do with how well you do your job. the only problem arises when OTHER people go out of their way to make it a problem.

get over it, people are gay. people have been gay since the dawn of time. people will continue to be gay, wanna know why? because they're born that way.

seriously, join the 21st century already, we're moving on, so come along or get out the way. no one is stopping for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> i know what you're asking, but i would be remiss if i didnt first start out by saying that we always recommend going thru a therapist/endo/GP first. that's because there is no such thing as a "standard dose" when it comes to HRT. everyone's body reacts differently, so it's always advisable to have a medical professional oversee your hormone therapy, especially since it's relatively easy to get to an informed consent clinic.

that being said, a great many people here, for one reason or another, do NOT have access to hrt with a prescription, and so choose to self-med. there are no judgments from any of us. </TEXT>

<TEXT> have to preface this with the usual "I AM NOT A DOCTOR"

First off, your body is adjusting to running off new hormones, it's going to feel uncomfortable for a bit. and because everyone's body is different, we all adjust to it differently.

So here's what my endo told me about the first few doses, that your body will see the influx of estrogen as a sign that the testicles are failing, and it will signal your gonads to kick into overdrive, i.e. to produce MORE testosterone. after a few more shots, your body will interpret that as the new normal, and send a signal to shut down the production of T.

some people also go on an emotional rollercoaster, i had one time where i had to pull over to the side of the road and bawl my eyes out, for no reason.

and as for looks? yeah, that inbetweeny stage is a royal bitch, i aint gonna lie. but you HAVE to ride it out, trust me on this one. it gets WAY better on the other side.

tl;dr: it's normal, it will pass, hold on, it'll get better </TEXT>

<TEXT> no, equality is never a problem. bigotry is. once you stop operating from a position that heterosexuality is the only option, the better off we will all be. 

there have been no issues with gay people serving in the US army regarding their sexuality. 

i'll go one step further, there are no issues with gay people in general, regarding their sexuality. 

the only problems arise when other people go out of their way to be bigots and make other people's sexuality their problem.

who people sleep with behind closed doors is none of your business. 

thank you for your time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> went for the hormones, yes. but i still have the naughty bits, lots of girls do. i know several who love using it. for me, because i'm asexual, i really have no attachment to the parts one way or another. i just dont want to risk the surgery. maybe that will change, but for now, i'm happy the way i am. 

and when it comes to my partners(i'm poly) i'll rock the strap-on and fuck them seven ways from sunday.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> you know, for the longest time, i tried to convince myself i was a straight crossdresser, that dressing was my fetish. but that urge wasnt just an urge to dress up, it was an urge to be female. dressing kinda scratched the urge, and for the longest time it was enough, until it started to become more  insistent as i got older, and then it became this NEED to be a girl.

So i transitioned, pretty much because i didnt really have a choice anymore. i had to become who i knew i was </TEXT>

<TEXT> i'm kinda late to this thread, but here are my thoughts.

1) if it's not bleeding too bad, monitor it for awhile and if it still doesnt improve, go to the ER/urgent care(or equivalent) and get treatment for it there.

2) make an appointment with a therapist. please. i dont know the reasons behind your attempt, but i know you were prolly in a really dark place. it's one that a lot of us recognize from past experiences. but the spiral doesnt always have to lead downwards, you have to find a way to change that path. please, please, PLEASE make an appointment with a therapist. </TEXT>

<TEXT> you're human, and a unique one at that. gender exists on a really broad spectrum, and we spend a lot of time figuring out where the hell we land on it. took me dang near 40 years before i acknowledged that i was a girl. i've known since i was 7, but denial is a helluva thing. i was stuck so far deep in the closet that i was munching carpet in Narnia.

dont let society dictate what you can and cannot do. now that's not to say that there wont be consequences, depending on where you live, being creative in your gender presentation might encourage some backlash. but to be true to yourself is the only way to be happy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Then go on blockers, it'll give you time to figure out if you are trans or not. the only one who can answer that question is you. and blockers just push puberty off for a little while longer. that way you can try life as a girl if you want, to see if it IS what you want. not everyone who goes on blockers transitions. but they're all happy that it gave them time to sort things out.

i say go for it. get yourself an appointment with a therapist, and an endo, and get on blockers as quickly as you can. buy yourself some time to figure it out.

<TEXT> i often wonder how my life would have turned out if i had come out at 18, would it have been easier or harder? i LOVE how attitudes towards trans people have changed so that it's more conducive for us to come out younger and younger. 

now as to what you can do.... any plans for college? trade school? student loans can be very helpful in getting your life started. (if you do it right)

<TEXT> you're at the inbetweeny stage right now, and that's one of the worst parts of transitioning. EVERYTHING was hard for me and i found myself questioning my sanity on a daily basis. but even then, i knew there was no going back for me. i tried being the boy everybody told me i was. but deep down inside, i knew i was a girl. and deep down inside, i think you know it too, i think a LOT of us know that. hang on, this will pass.

and one thing i know is that you are NOT alone, we're all here for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, seeing a therapist is always a good first step, that's the one thing we always stress in all the trans subs. we tend to have a certain bias toward that kind of question, one that almost invariably leads to a positive answer. 

that being said, certain aspects of your story are extremely similar to mine. growing up, i always used to sneak into my sister's room and try on her clothes. they just felt soooooooo good to try on, and it made me very happy.

of course that led to a looooooooooooong period of buying and purging women's clothes. even in the army, i always had an  item or two stashed away.

it was always JUST enough, to wear the clothes whenever i got those "urges". but eventually, the need to be a girl became too great. i had to face the fact that i wasnt, in fact, a crossdresser, that i was, in fact, just a girl.

that was kind of a hard fact to reconcile with myself, especially with me being 42. but, as with all things in life, facts have a funny way of being true, regardless of how you, or anyone else, feels about them. 

and the fact of the matter, was that i AM a girl. Nothing on god's green earth can change that.

go see your therapist, if nothing else, telling someone else and sharing that secret you've had for so long is extremely liberating. you'll feel a weight lift off, sounds hokey, i know, but when i told my therapist, it was SUCH a feeling of relief. a secret like that weighs you down, and it just gets heavier and heavier, but it does so gradually, so you dont really notice til it's lifted. 

see your therapist, i hope you find your answer there. and please, always feel free to come here to share. you might also want to post in /r/asktransgender, or go read thru the posts there. you'll find lots of stories similar to yours. you're not alone, there are plenty of us who share the same stories. </TEXT>

<TEXT> well, the first thing i'd say is for you to bring this up with a therapist. 

now that the disclaimer is out of the way...

that button test we all go on about, you know, the one where we press it and hey change-o presto, you get to wake up the next day and be a girl? guess what, you can press it at any time. just in your case, you wake up in a girl's body that's 6'3" and 273 pounds. and in so doing, you get to join the party of trans girls, and girls in general, bemoaning the fact that we dont look like supermodels. congratulations! here's a cookie.

look, it's not easy for us, but we transition because we're trans, and we're NOT the gender we were assigned at birth. we dont transition to fit into society's assumption of some arbitrary standard of what constitutes a female. 

that fear of what other people will think holds so many of us back, and that fear is often what drives so many of us to attempt suicide, some of us, multiple times.

go make an appointment with a gender therapist, it'll help more than you think. and dont forget, we'll always be here for you.

oh, and welcome to planet girl, buckle up, it's a hell of a ride </TEXT>

<TEXT> I want to make a few things perfectly clear. Trans women are women. Period. End of story. Were not women who used to be men. Were not men who identify as women. Were not males who identify as women. Were not men who became women. WE ARE WOMEN. Stop putting qualifiers on our womanhood. Its offensive, hurtful and cruel to insinuate otherwise. Our past, present, and futures are ours to define and no one elses. Even if we didnt figure out that we were trans until well into our adult lives, it absolutely does not mean that we were ever boys or men. Many trans women feel that theyve always been girls, or at the very least, that theyve never been boys. You dont have any right to tell me, or any other trans person, that they were ever a particular gender, just as I have no right to tell you what gender you are. A trans woman who was obligated to present as male for most of her young life is was no more born a man than a lesbian who was obligated to date men for most of her young life used to be straight. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When child abuse specialists, teachers, lawyers, and child care and school administrators convened at a symposium in 1995 to collectively decide what distinguishes developmentally expected sexual behaviors from those that suggest dysfunctional development and could be harmful, they decided that masturbation, inspecting the bodies of other children, and kissingthe three things Dunham writes about doingall belonged in the first category. 

As opposed to  the criminal-justice definition of sibling sexual abuse, which is forcible rape, forcible sodomy, sexual assault with an object, and forcible fondling. which Josh Duggar clearly engaged in, according to his own admission.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Psychiatrist and WPATH Board Member, Dr. Dan Karasic, responded quickly to the WSJ, and his letter was one of a few selected for publication. We are including the full text of Dr. Karasics response below, though it is important to note that the WSJ editors chose to omit his clarification of Dr. Dhejnes research. WPATH members should be aware of the facts concerning these debates.

Dr. Paul McHugh ("Transgender surgery isnt the solution) writes about the study at Johns Hopkins in the 1970s showing poor outcomes from transgender surgeries, leading to McHugh shutting down Johns Hopkins transgender program in 1979, and the US Department of Health and Human Services declaring transgender surgery experimental, and therefore not covered. Two weeks ago, HHS reversed its 1981 decision, and removed transgender health exclusions from Medicare. McHugh seems unaware of the work in transgender health in these last 30 years that led to this reversal by HHS. 

McHugh does cite one study from 2011, by Cecilia Dhejne, MD and colleagues at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. However, he misunderstands Dr. Dhejnes work. In the paper, Dr. Dhejne states that the study was not designed to draw conclusions on the efficacy of transgender surgeries, yet McHugh does exactly that. A closer reading of the paper shows that the increased mortality is in those who had surgery before 1989, and that mortality in trans people after 1989 is not statistically different from the general population. A recently published paper by Dr. Dhejne and colleagues shows that the regret rate for those having surgery from 2001-2010 is only 0.3%. Dr. Dhejnes work shows that outcomes for transgender surgery have improved tremendously in the past 30 years, which supports the HHS decision to remove trans exclusions. 

McHugh also mischaracterizes the treatment of gender nonconforming children. As McHugh states, most gender nonconforming children do not identify as transgender in adulthood.  However, those who receive puberty blocking drugs do not do so until puberty, when trans identity is likely to persist. These drugs allow adolescents and their parents to work with doctors to achieve the best outcome. This approach was demonstrated to be successful in research in the Netherlands before being adopted widely in the U.S. 

The American Psychiatric Association and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health no longer view transgender identity as inherently pathological. Dr. McHughs views are stuck in the past.

no, you're not, you're basically saying that YOU arent comfortable with trans people. that's it. you do not speak for anybody else. 

Simply put, I do not care one bit if you want to go so crazy as to slap on a pair of leggings, a tutu and a bright orange neon thong, prance around and sing I'm a barbie girl followed up with whatever the hell girls do.

and sexist too, nice.

 I however do not think you need to be in a restroom where many people expect a certain level of privacy from members of the opposite sex. You are not physically built like a woman. This can cause discomfort to people who are.

again, transphobic. even after i posted the study of all the schools, comprising 600k students where transgender polices are in effect showing that there have been ZERO incidents.

The best response you have to this is to keep saying it doesn't because "there are no recorded incidents" Is a totally dishonest way to debate seeing as there are pretty much no studies out there taking into consideration how the physically male and female students feel about it. At least none that are easily accessible. I can find a grand total of 3 quotes from students forced to share the restroom.

if there have been no reported incidents, then there is no reason to restrict access. like i sed, you have a solution in search of a problem.

I'm misgendering you because you're not even reading a damn word I say and overall being very disingenuous in how you are conducting this discussion... If you can call it that. I don't respect you enough to give a shit what you think you are at this point.

so basically you made up a reason for misgendering me. gotcha

like i said, there are none so blind as those who cannot see their own privilege or transphobia. just like the fundies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> right, like i said, as long as we established that you were in fact transphobic. it's ok to admit that you're wrong, we all make mistakes. 

even tho there have been zero incidents at the school districts that have instituted a transgender policy where trans people can in fact have the use of the restroom of their gender. yet you insist on saying that it would make people uncomfortable. again, you advocate a solution where no problem exists. 

there are none so blind as those who cannot see their own privilege, or their own bigotry. 

absent religion people, like you, will automatically default to the "ick" argument. EWWWW, that's grossssssss. i don wanna see it, make it go awaaaaaaaaaaaay. 

which, is a pretty juvenile argument, and i'm glad that i could point it out. it's not MY problem that you cant get over your own prejudice.

ok, right there, that's textbook transphobia. the bathroom i was built for? please, i've used both boys and girls bathrooms, nobody has given a shit, wanna know why? cuz people use the bathrooms because they have to go. nothing more, nothing less.


 I AM saying that if this becomes the norm, it is easily exploitable, and that's a very dangerous thing.

again, unless you can show me a case where a trans person has assaulted another person in a bathroom, you're a solution in search of a problem. </TEXT>

**American Medical Association**  
Resolution: Removing Financial Barriers to Care for Transgender Patients (2008)  
An established body of medical research demonstrates the effectiveness and medical necessity of mental health care, hormone therapy and sex reassignment surgery as forms of therapeutic treatment for many people diagnosed with GID Therefore, be it
RESOLVED, that the AMA supports public and private health insurance coverage for  treatment of gender identity disorder.
http://www.tgender.net/taw/ama_resolutions.pdf  
Resolution H-185.950: Removing Financial Barriers to Care for Transgender Patients (2008)  
Our AMA supports public and private health insurance coverage for treatment of gender identity disorder as recommended by the patients physician. (Res. 122; A-08)  
http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/PolicyFinder/policyfiles/HnE/H-185.950.HTM

**American Psychiatric Association**  
Position Statement on Access to Care for Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals (2012)  
 The American Psychiatric Association:  
1. Recognizes that appropriately evaluated transgender and gender variant individuals can benefit greatly from medical and surgical gender transition treatments.  
2. Advocates for removal of barriers to care and supports both public and private health insurance coverage for gender transition treatment.  
3. Opposes categorical exclusions of coverage for such medically necessary treatment when prescribed by a physician.  

www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Advocacy%20and%20Newsroom/Position%20Statements/ps2012_TransgenderCare.pdf  
Position Statement on Discrimination Against Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals
(2012)  
 Being transgender gender or variant implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities; however, these individuals often experience discrimination due to a lack of civil rights protections for their gender identity or expression Thus, this position statement is relevant to the APA because discrimination and lack of equal civil rights is damaging to the mental health of  transgender and gender variant individuals.  

**The American Psychiatric Association:**  
1. Supports laws that protect the civil rights of transgender and gender variant individuals.  
2. Urges the repeal of laws and policies that discriminate against transgender and gender variant individuals.  
3. Opposes all public and private discrimination against transgender and gender variant individuals in such areas as health care, employment, housing, public accommodation, education, and licensing.  
4. Declares that no burden of proof of such judgment, capacity, or reliability shall be placed upon these individuals greater than that imposed on any other persons.
www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Advocacy%20and%20Newsroom/Position%20Statements/ps2012_TransgenderDiscrimination.pdf

American Psychological Association
Policy on Transgender, Gender Identity   Gender Expression Non-Discrimination (2008)
As stated in the Policy on Transgender, Gender Identity   Gender Expression NonDiscrimination,
the APA opposes all public and private discrimination on the basis of actual or perceived gender identity and expression and urges the repeal of discriminatory laws and policies and calls upon psychologists in their professional roles to provide appropriate, nondiscriminatory treatment to transgender and gender variant individuals and encourages psychologists to take a leadership role in working against discrimination towards transgender and gender variant individuals. 

The APA recognizes the efficacy, benefit and medical necessity of gender transition treatments for appropriately evaluated individuals and calls upon public and private insurers to cover these medically necessary treatments.  
http://www.apa.org/about/policy/transgender.aspx

**American Academy of Family Physicians**  
Resolution No. 1004 (2012)
In 2007, an AAFP Commission declared that the association has a policy opposing any
form of patient discrimination and stated its opposition to the exclusion of transgender
health care. In 2012, the organization released a new resolution: RESOLVED, That the
American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) support efforts to require insurers to
provide coverage for comprehensive care of [transgender] individuals including medical
care, screening tests based on medical need rather than gender, mental health care, and,
when medically necessary, gender reassignment surgery.
http://www.aafp.org/dam/AAFP/documents/about_us/special_constituencies/2012RCAR_Advocacy.pdf

**American Academy of Physician Assistants**  
Non-Discrimination Statement  (Adopted 2000; amended 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2008)
Physician assistants should not discriminate against classes or categories of patients in the delivery of needed health care. Such classes and categories includegender identity.

**American College of Nurse Midwives**  
Transgender/Transsexual/Gender Variant Health Care (2012)
The American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM) supports efforts to provide transgender, transsexual, and gender variant individuals with access to safe, comprehensive, culturally competent health care and therefore endorses the 2011 World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care

Please see Ethical Conduct for the Physician Assistant Profession (Adopted 2000, amended 2004, 2006, 2007, and 2008) and Comprehensive Health Care Reform (Adopted 2005 and amended 2010). 

**National Association of Social Workers**  
Transgender and Gender Identity Issues Policy Statement (2008)
 NASW supports the rights of all individuals to receive health insurance and other health coverage without discrimination on the basis of gender identity, and specifically without exclusion of services related to transgender or transsexual transitionin order to receive medical and mental health services through their primary care physician and the appropriate referrals to medical specialists, which may include hormone replacement therapy, surgical interventions, prosthetic devices, and other medical procedures.  
http://www.socialworkers.org/da/da2008/finalvoting/documents/Transgender%202nd%20round%20-%20Clean.pdf

**World Professional Association for Transgender Health**  
Clarification on Medical Necessity of Treatment, Sex Reassignment, and Insurance Coverage in the U.S.A. (2008)  
WPATH found that decades of experience with the Standards of Care show gender transitions and related care to be accepted, good medical practice and effective treatment.  
In a 2008 clarification, WPATH stated:

[S]ex reassignment, properly indicated and performed as provided by the Standards of Care, has proven to be beneficial and effective in the treatment of individuals with transsexualism, gender identity disorder, and/or gender dysphoria. Sex reassignment plays an undisputed role in contributing toward favorable outcomes, and comprises Real Life Experience, legal name and sex change on identity documents, as well as medically necessary hormone treatment, counseling, psychotherapy, and other medical procedures...


The medical procedures attendant to sex reassignment are not cosmetic or elective or for the mere convenience of the patient. These reconstructive procedures are not optional in any meaningful sense, but are understood to be medically necessary for the treatment of the diagnosed condition.
http://www.wpath.org/documents/Med%20Nec%20on%202008%20Letterhead.pdf

**National Commission on Correctional Health Care**


Position Statement: Transgender Health Care in Correctional Settings (2009) 

The health risks of overlooking the particular needs of transgender inmates are so severe that acknowledgment of the problem and policies that assure appropriate and responsible provision of health care are needed.  
Because prisons, jails, and juvenile justice facilities have a responsibility to ensure the physical and mental health and well-being of transgender people in their custody, correctional health staff should manage these inmates in a manner that respects the
biomedical and psychological aspects of a gender identity disorder (GID) diagnosis.

<TEXT> While both serious issues, they are very different. 

Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), or body dysmorphia, is an anxiety disorder that causes sufferers to spend a lot of time worrying about their appearance and to have a distorted view of how they look.

Gender dysphoria is a condition where a person experiences discomfort or distress because there is a mismatch between their biological sex and gender identity...This mismatch between sex and gender identity can lead to distressing and uncomfortable feelings that are called gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is a recognised medical condition, for which treatment is sometimes appropriate. It is not a mental illness.

both those definitions are from Britain's National Health Service. With the changes in the new Diagnostic Standards Manual (version V), there has been the removal of disorder in the title of the entry concerning gender identity (which in previous versions was labeled gender identity disorder). Although there are still hold outs, the vast majority of medical professionals and mental healthcare providers agree: if a person with gender dysphoria is having issues with mental illness, which is not uncommon, gender dysphoria is not the underlying cause. Rather, it is society's unwillingness to treat individuals with gender dysphoria with care, dignity, and respect (including necessary medical treatment, when appropriate) which can lead to maladjustment. A great many individuals with gender dysphoria are considered perfectly well-adjusted, the stressors of gender dysphoria being comparable to other stressors associated with any serious medical condition. </TEXT>

<TEXT> it's a perfectly normal response, when everybody just assumes jenner's transition is how we all do it, where you just go away for awhile and come back and you're FABULOUS. but think of it this way, she started transitioning in the 80's. and then stopped when she got married to Kris. so she's been stuck in that awkward inbetweeny stage for THIRTY years. and they have said some AWFUL things about her appearance in that time. So she's had a LOT of abuse heaped on her, more so because she's a celebrity.

i know how exhausting it can get with people wanting to talk about you being trans when all you want to do is get on with your life. i try to do trans 101 as often as i can, but i do have those days where i will just go stealth and just get on with my day.

the media storm will pass, but hopefully, people will have gained a more positive outlook and a little understanding about what it is to be trans. </TEXT>

<TEXT> there are several medical associations that would disagree with you

**American Medical Association**  
Resolution: Removing Financial Barriers to Care for Transgender Patients (2008)  
An established body of medical research demonstrates the effectiveness and medical necessity of mental health care, hormone therapy and sex reassignment surgery as forms of therapeutic treatment for many people diagnosed with GID Therefore, be it
RESOLVED, that the AMA supports public and private health insurance coverage for  treatment of gender identity disorder.
http://www.tgender.net/taw/ama_resolutions.pdf  
Resolution H-185.950: Removing Financial Barriers to Care for Transgender Patients (2008)  
Our AMA supports public and private health insurance coverage for treatment of gender identity disorder as recommended by the patients physician. (Res. 122; A-08)  
http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/PolicyFinder/policyfiles/HnE/H-185.950.HTM

**American Psychiatric Association**  
Position Statement on Access to Care for Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals (2012)  
 The American Psychiatric Association:  
1. Recognizes that appropriately evaluated transgender and gender variant individuals can benefit greatly from medical and surgical gender transition treatments.  
2. Advocates for removal of barriers to care and supports both public and private health insurance coverage for gender transition treatment.  
3. Opposes categorical exclusions of coverage for such medically necessary treatment when prescribed by a physician.  

www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Advocacy%20and%20Newsroom/Position%20Statements/ps2012_TransgenderCare.pdf  
Position Statement on Discrimination Against Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals
(2012)  
 Being transgender gender or variant implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities; however, these individuals often experience discrimination due to a lack of civil rights protections for their gender identity or expression Thus, this position statement is relevant to the APA because discrimination and lack of equal civil rights is damaging to the mental health of  transgender and gender variant individuals.  

**The American Psychiatric Association:**  
1. Supports laws that protect the civil rights of transgender and gender variant individuals.  
2. Urges the repeal of laws and policies that discriminate against transgender and gender variant individuals.  
3. Opposes all public and private discrimination against transgender and gender variant individuals in such areas as health care, employment, housing, public accommodation, education, and licensing.  
4. Declares that no burden of proof of such judgment, capacity, or reliability shall be placed upon these individuals greater than that imposed on any other persons.
www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Advocacy%20and%20Newsroom/Position%20Statements/ps2012_TransgenderDiscrimination.pdf

American Psychological Association
Policy on Transgender, Gender Identity   Gender Expression Non-Discrimination (2008)
As stated in the Policy on Transgender, Gender Identity   Gender Expression NonDiscrimination,
the APA opposes all public and private discrimination on the basis of actual or perceived gender identity and expression and urges the repeal of discriminatory laws and policies and calls upon psychologists in their professional roles to provide appropriate, nondiscriminatory treatment to transgender and gender variant individuals and encourages psychologists to take a leadership role in working against discrimination towards transgender and gender variant individuals. 

The APA recognizes the efficacy, benefit and medical necessity of gender transition treatments for appropriately evaluated individuals and calls upon public and private insurers to cover these medically necessary treatments.  
http://www.apa.org/about/policy/transgender.aspx

**American Academy of Family Physicians**  
Resolution No. 1004 (2012)
In 2007, an AAFP Commission declared that the association has a policy opposing any
form of patient discrimination and stated its opposition to the exclusion of transgender
health care. In 2012, the organization released a new resolution: RESOLVED, That the
American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) support efforts to require insurers to
provide coverage for comprehensive care of [transgender] individuals including medical
care, screening tests based on medical need rather than gender, mental health care, and,
when medically necessary, gender reassignment surgery.
http://www.aafp.org/dam/AAFP/documents/about_us/special_constituencies/2012RCAR_Advocacy.pdf

**American Academy of Physician Assistants**  
Non-Discrimination Statement  (Adopted 2000; amended 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2008)
Physician assistants should not discriminate against classes or categories of patients in the delivery of needed health care. Such classes and categories includegender identity.

**American College of Nurse Midwives**  
Transgender/Transsexual/Gender Variant Health Care (2012)
The American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM) supports efforts to provide transgender, transsexual, and gender variant individuals with access to safe, comprehensive, culturally competent health care and therefore endorses the 2011 World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care

Please see Ethical Conduct for the Physician Assistant Profession (Adopted 2000, amended 2004, 2006, 2007, and 2008) and Comprehensive Health Care Reform (Adopted 2005 and amended 2010). 

**National Association of Social Workers**  
Transgender and Gender Identity Issues Policy Statement (2008)
 NASW supports the rights of all individuals to receive health insurance and other health coverage without discrimination on the basis of gender identity, and specifically without exclusion of services related to transgender or transsexual transitionin order to receive medical and mental health services through their primary care physician and the appropriate referrals to medical specialists, which may include hormone replacement therapy, surgical interventions, prosthetic devices, and other medical procedures.  
http://www.socialworkers.org/da/da2008/finalvoting/documents/Transgender%202nd%20round%20-%20Clean.pdf

**World Professional Association for Transgender Health**  
Clarification on Medical Necessity of Treatment, Sex Reassignment, and Insurance Coverage in the U.S.A. (2008)  
WPATH found that decades of experience with the Standards of Care show gender transitions and related care to be accepted, good medical practice and effective treatment.  
In a 2008 clarification, WPATH stated:

[S]ex reassignment, properly indicated and performed as provided by the Standards of Care, has proven to be beneficial and effective in the treatment of individuals with transsexualism, gender identity disorder, and/or gender dysphoria. Sex reassignment plays an undisputed role in contributing toward favorable outcomes, and comprises Real Life Experience, legal name and sex change on identity documents, as well as medically necessary hormone treatment, counseling, psychotherapy, and other medical procedures...


The medical procedures attendant to sex reassignment are not cosmetic or elective or for the mere convenience of the patient. These reconstructive procedures are not optional in any meaningful sense, but are understood to be medically necessary for the treatment of the diagnosed condition.
http://www.wpath.org/documents/Med%20Nec%20on%202008%20Letterhead.pdf

**National Commission on Correctional Health Care**


Position Statement: Transgender Health Care in Correctional Settings (2009) 

The health risks of overlooking the particular needs of transgender inmates are so severe that acknowledgment of the problem and policies that assure appropriate and responsible provision of health care are needed.  
Because prisons, jails, and juvenile justice facilities have a responsibility to ensure the physical and mental health and well-being of transgender people in their custody, correctional health staff should manage these inmates in a manner that respects the
biomedical and psychological aspects of a gender identity disorder (GID) diagnosis.

In the upcoming fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5),
people whose gender at birth is contrary to the one they identify with will be diagnosed with gender
dysphoria. This diagnosis is a revision of DSM-IVs criteria for gender identity disorder and is intended

<TEXT> the process is different from state to state. some states allow for change of name and gender by court order, some by doctor's letter. some states will allow you to change the gender on your birth certificate, some dont, some allow you to change it only if you have had reassignment surgery.

i live in california, so my name and gender change was pretty easy, i made an appointment at the court, went before the judge and got a court ordered name and gender change. i then went to the dmv and the social security office and gave them the court order and they changed my name and gender. 

same with the bank. and all the other agencies i had to deal with, power company, phone, internet, insurance, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> i know why the admins did it, it's obviously to cover their ass. but people actually DO go to /r/asktransgender for medical advice. and i just want to be sure that people know that we arent doctors and that even if we were, we still couldnt advise them without examining them in the first place. 

we all know people who self-med, either because they couldnt spend one more day as the gender they werent, or because they had no access to meds. 

at the same time, there's no one standard dose because everybody's body is different.

i think if people know the entire range of dosages available as well as what a typical person's hormone range is, then they'll have enough info to make a decision.

In Mein Kampf, Hitler makes a number of religious allusions, claiming to be "acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator" and to have been chosen by providence.[14][20] In a 1922 speech he said,"My feelings as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter [...] who [...] recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them..."[21] In a 1928 speech, he said: "We tolerate no one in our ranks who attacks the ideas of Christianity ... in fact our movement is Christian." </TEXT>

 you could have easily ended the convo hours ago, by simply pointing out proof, ANY proof that your god exists. you havent, so we go on dancing. i'm quite enjoying this. i can to tell you that there is no god, and there's nothing you can do about it, because you know i'm right. 

amazing isnt it? one simple statement of fact as opposed to reams and reams of oratory as priests and pastors struggle to try and convince the flock every weekend that there is a god when half of them dont believe it themselves.

so, in conclusion, i submit, yet again, that there is no god. </TEXT>

<TEXT> yeah, the one thing that surprised me was how much it affected some people. one of my really good, really old friends pretty much had the same reaction as your friend did. 

you have to give them a moment to have a moment. they go thru the same stages of grief as you would losing somebody. it's silly, but that's what happens.

you've had years to think this over, it's ALL new to them, and it can be a little overwhelming. i cant tell you how surprised i was when a few of my friends needed MY support in dealing with it.

cracked me up to no end.

so just give your friend a little time. just talk thru their fears, try and make them see that they're not losing you at all. it'll still be you, just in a body that you're more comfortable in. </TEXT>

<TEXT> it's ok to let go of the idea of god. i know it's scary, it always is to let go of something that you've thought was solid bedrock, only to see, once the wool has been taken away from your eyes, to be nothing more than shifting sand.

it's ok. 

it'll be ok.

let go of your god and let him drift away on the wind that created him in teh first place.

come be with the free folk, those of us who live life fully engaged in the world, where we live for THIS life, because we know that this is the only life we get. </TEXT>

<TEXT> well, let's review shall we? you've asked me to prove that there is no god, which i have. but you seem to disagree with my methods of summoning a god. so i have repeatedly asked you what the proper way of summoning a god is, which you have not provided. failing that, i've asked you how you can prove that there is a god, but i'm still waiting for that proof. 

again, should you provided me a single shred of evidence that a god exists, i will happily change my mind. isnt that what you are called to do in your faith? well, i'm asking. please prove that your god exists, and i will add my name to the roster of true believers.

CAN I GET AN AMEN??? </TEXT>

<TEXT> yes, and which is why we say that you can discuss YOUR OWN DOSE as well as to state that we ARENT doctors.

every single one of us knows somebody who self-meds. some do because they didnt want to spend one more day as a gender they werent. some of us just had no access to a doctor who would prescribe them hormones. 

we are NOT against self-medding. we just ask that people not give out advice as if there were only one dose for everybody. there isnt. i'm not on spiro, or progesterone, only estrogen shots. one of my girlfriends is on shots too, but she takes them every week as opposed to every two weeks like me. my other partner is on spiro, estrogen, and progesterone, and she might add avodart to her regimen.

yes, not all of us have access to a doctor. which is why we allow discussions about dosing AS LONG AS WE DONT SUGGEST THAT IT IS WHAT EVERYONE SHOULD DO.

i have two other trans girls living with me, and we are ALL on different prescriptions. it is the height of arrogance to assume that you know what the other person's correct dosage should be.

<TEXT> i know you feel alone, when i came out, i thought i'd have to do this all by my lonesome, and my friends not only supported me, but they wanted to come along for the ride. i have never cried as much as i did the day i came out to my friends and one by one they almost all gave me their unconditional support. by the time i was done telling all my friends, i was a blubbering pile of jello.

you're not alone, you never will be.

your answer means that you'd be happier as a girl, which means the answer to your question of whether or not to transition is "YES"

if you are trans, then the only option for us IS to transition. who can only find true happiness if we are in turn true to ourselves. living a lie will never achieve that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> i grew up methodist, spent ten summers at bible camp, i know religious stupid. my dad doesnt believe that trans is a thing. out of my entire family, i have two cousins who support me.... and that's it. if you have a religious fam fam like i did, you are shit of out luck. my dad tells me all the time that he'll pray for me. 

my friends are my family now, although i'm not giving up hope that my fam fam will come around.

but you transition or not because you're trans, or not. not because of anyone else but you. 

if you had that magic button to press, and you could wake up tomorrow in the other gender and no one would be the wiser, would you do it or not? therein lies your answer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> there's no one way to be genderfluid, if you sub to /r/genderqueer (i mod over there too), you'll find lots of people who experience gender in MANY different ways and who present in many more variants than you think possible.

i know plenty of people who shift abruptly, somtimes from one extreme to another, i.e. super femme to super butch.

i cant speak to your other issues, but your gender issues are NOT out of the ordinary.

come over and chat, post the same question you did here, you'll find plenty of people replying </TEXT>

<TEXT> every religious figure you can mention was a flawed human being.

Martin Luther  King was a serial adulterer, the FBIs monitoring of King  make up much of what we now know about the mans personal life. King had engaged in so many extramarital affairs that his wife, Coretta Scott King, had reportedly become disillusioned with their marriage.

Kings right-hand man, Ralph Abernathy, wrote in his 1989 autobiography that the staff all understood and believed in the biblical prohibition against sex outside marriage. It was just that he had a particularly difficult time with that temptation.

Billy Graham? Homophobic bigot. He considered homosexual behavior to be a "sinister form of perversion," a lifestyle choice that will lead gays to personal ruin. When a young woman wrote him about her sexual love for another woman in 1974, the evangelist replied with a threat: homosexual perverts will not inherit the kingdom of heaven. "Your affection for another of your own sex is misdirected and will be judged by God's holy standards," he answered.

Mahatma Gandhi? He had unusual personal practices (which included, alongside his famed chastity, sleeping naked next to nubile, naked women to test his restraint.) The pre-independence prime minister of the Indian state of Travancore called him, "a most dangerous, semi-repressed sex maniac"

<TEXT> before i came out, i crossdressed pretty much only to fap too. i was turned on by wearing all the sexy lingerie. then i decided to go out en femme one halloween, i found the frilliest outfit to wear, and i was TERRIFIED of going out like that because i was scared i was going to have a raging boner the whole time thru. once i walked thru that door(took me about half an hour to work up the courage), i was just HAPPY to be dressed as a girl. i loved the feeling of the air swishing past my thighs. 

and once i started hrt, even the morning wood went away. i still love dressing up in sexy lingerie, but only because it makes me feel super sexy. i blame testosterone poisoning, "here, let me take a simple situation AND SEXUALIZE IT TO THE MAX"

who knew that tall girls have big feet? /s

took me a year before i finally saw a girl staring back at me in the mirror.

and listen, your mom can call you a jabberwocky for all that it matters, it doesnt make it true. you know you're a girl, nothing on this plane of existence or beyond can change that fact.

that's the pesky thing about facts, they're true whether people choose to believe in them or not.

<TEXT> From the WPATH Standards of Care

A mental health screening and/or assessment is needed for referral to hormonal
and surgical treatments for gender dysphoria. In contrast, psychotherapyalthough highly
recommendedis not a requirement. 

The SOC do not recommend a minimum number of psychotherapy sessions prior to hormone
therapy or surgery. The reasons for this are multifaceted (Lev, 2009). First, a minimum number of
sessions tends to be construed as a hurdle, which discourages the genuine opportunity for personal
growth. Second, mental health professionals can offer important support to clients throughout
all phases of exploration of gender identity, gender expression, and possible transitionnot just
prior to any possible medical interventions. Third, clients and their psychotherapists differ in their
abilities to attain similar goals in a specified time period.

And RLE is only require for GCS,  not HRT

From the WPATH SoC:

The current Board of Directors of the WPATH herewith expresses its conviction that sex (gender) reassignment, properly indicated and performed as provided by the Standards of Care, has proven to be beneficial and effective in the treatment of individuals with transsexualism, gender identity disorder, and/or gender dysphoria. Sex reassignment plays an undisputed role in contributing toward favorable outcomes, and comprises Real Life Experience, legal name and sex change on identity documents, as well as medically necessary hormone treatment, counseling, psychotherapy, and other medical procedures. Genital reconstruction is not required for social gender recognition, and such surgery should not be a prerequisite for document or record changes; the Real Life Experience component of the transition process is crucial to psychological adjustment, and is usually completed prior to any genital reconstruction, when appropriate for the patient, according to the WPATH Standards of Care. Changes to documentation are important aids to social functioning, and are a necessary component of the pre-surgical process; delay of document changes may have a deleterious impact on a patient's social integration and personal safety.

<TEXT> i have never seen so many messages in my inbox. lots of them were from my friends with nothing but support. had a few from bible thumping friends i had when i was going to an all boys christian school and ten years of summer bible camp. those werent too fun, mostly cuz they were along the lines of "god doesnt make mistakes" and "i'll pray for you to see the light" or some other ineffectual bullshit. 

family was the hardest, my parents didnt take it too well, nor my religious aunt and cousin. i have a really big fam fam, and only two of my cousins talk to me right now. 

my friends are my family now. i honestly thought i'd have to go thru transition by myself, and my friends made me cry because not only did they support me, but they wanted to come along for the ride. and that made me smile inside, even tho i was bawling my eyes out like a baby.

it's been a blast, and i dont regret it one bit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> yeah, i know they say that they dont require a court order any more, i was sure asked for one at the dmv. the court doesnt keep a record of your gender other than when you file the application for name and/or gender change.

at the DMV, they required the DL-44, which is the application for new license, and a DL 329, which must be completed by a licensed U.S. physician or psychologist.

but in addition,  they required a court order, Form NC-230, to go along with it. 

i dont think they updated their procedure, cuz people at the dmv and SSA were pretty confused. the court order made it way easier. that little piece of paper carries a lot of weight to it.  </TEXT>

that said, i've known i was trans since i was 7, i saw a documentary on a group of trans women prostitutes working to save money for their transition. in my head i knew i could "switch to be a girl!" of course, i spent the next 33 years fighting myself, because just like you i'd go thru periods where i'd be fine with myself, and other times where i'd just YEARN to be a girl.

and it IS exhausting. after years of frustration and depression, it just got to a point where i ran out of energy. i broke down and went to go see a therapist. and started transition pretty soon after that.  </TEXT>

right, no proof, gotcha. thanks.

A communist state is a country run primarily on the principles of Marx and Engels with the end goal being the establishment of communist ideology worldwide. 

"Communist state" is a state that aims to achieve Socialism and then achieve Communism. Most communist states have been states with a form of government characterized by single-party rule or dominant-party system by a party which claims to follow communism, usually with a professed allegiance to Marxism-Leninism as the guiding ideology of the state. None of these states achieved communism, and the term is used no matter to what degree that state or the movement associated with it actually follows communism, if at all. nonetheless, they are considered communist. 

 Furthermore, both the war on drugs and on communism are very obviously connected by the effects they have on US foreign policy towards the Latin American region and therefore geopolitics.

we're not living in the 50's. there is no war against communism. that died when nixon went to china. the cuban exiles who are still mad at castro are fast becoming the minority. any conversation in miami today will show you that, and the polls show it as well.

<TEXT> You may not believe in CIA actions against Chavez

if can point to a single shred of evidence that the CIA in your words "went after" Chavez, i'd be happy to stand corrected.

And of course China, Vietnam, North Korea and Cuba differ politically. Mostly because none of them are communist states.

this statement is so ludicrous, i cant even.

The Communist Party of China is the sole governing party of China, which  is organized on the basis of democratic centralism, a principle conceived by Russian Marxist theoretician Vladimir Lenin which entails democratic and open discussion on policy on the condition of unity in upholding the agreed upon policies.

The Socialist Republic of Vietnam is a single-party state. A new state constitution was approved in April 1992, replacing the 1975 version. The central role of the Communist Party was reasserted in all organs of government, politics and society. Only political organizations affiliated with or endorsed by the Communist Party are permitted to contest elections. 

According to policy experts and news reports, including the BBC World Service, North Korea continues to embrace a communist ideology and is a de facto communist government. In 2014, for example, the BBC Country Report on North Korea characterized it as a nominal communist government

The Communist Party of Cuba is the only political party permitted in the Republic of Cuba, others are not allowed to exist. It is a communist party of the Marxist-Leninist model.

The war against drugs and the war against communism aren't separate issues.

yes they are, because they're not even remotely connected to each other in any way shape or form.

However most of them are strongly anti-Castro.

again, you're wrong. Nearly 600,000 U.S. travelers went to Cuba last year  the majority of them Cuban Americans. 

http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/poll-cuba-obama-cuban-americans-florida-116570.html

http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/11/us-cuba-usa-poll-idUSKBN0M72KO20150311

Regardless my point is that it's in Cuba's better interests to seek trade opportunities in solidarity with the latin american nations instead, even if only to maintain its economic sovereignity from the US. 

once the embargo is lifted, cuba can establish ties with whichever country they want to. right now, they cant, because the trade embargo penalizes countries and corporations who do business with cuba. </TEXT>

and Cuba is communist, like vetnam, china, and north korea, and you can see that communism is very different in each of those countries. 

you cant mix up socialism either, because Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Sweden, and Norway are all socialist countries too.


you keep mixing up the war against communism and the war against drugs, both of which are equally ludicrous. the faster the US decriminalizes drugs the better. hopefully marijuana will be legal in more states by 2016 and mdma, lsd, and mushrooms will be taken off the banned list of drugs so that research can be conducted.

and finally, the US lies 90 miles away from the cuba, it is GOING be the biggest trading partner. miami might as well be another cuban city. the ties run too deep. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The distinction between sex and gender differentiates sex (anatomy of an individual's reproductive system, and secondary sex characteristics) from gender (social roles based on the sex of the person, usually culturally learned), or personal identification of one's own gender based on an internal awareness (gender identity). Gender is sometimes referred to as the sex of the brain. In some circumstances, an individual's assigned sex and gender do not align, and the result is sometimes a transgender person. </TEXT>

and believe me, if i posted to srs every time i ran into a homophobe or a transphobe, that's all i'd be doing on reddit. i DO however want to try and change attitudes myself.

i cant change the fact that i'm trans. i CAN try and change perceptions of trans people so that maybe someday, we can serve openly.

this article was relevant to me as a trans woman and as someone who served her country (full disclosure - not US Military). if you want i could get my jarhead friends to repost this.

there are transgender vets from all branches of the service, that's a fact. and there will CONTINUE to be trans people who serve, as a mod of a few transgender subs, i know this to be true because i know several people who are currently on active service.

i posted it here because it was apropos for both me and the sub. why dont you try reading the article first before you judge.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> ok, there's a lot going on here, so let's break it down, it'll be easier to handle in chunks. taken altogether, it's overwhelming.

ok, first thing you have to know is that you can transition on the DL, you'll just need a sports bra when the boobs start coming in. either that, or maybe it's time to find some on campus accommodation.

if you have your health insurance thru your school,  trying sending your hormones to a PO Box, they're relatively easy to get, or send it to a friend you trust. (i'm going to assume your parents will snoop)

now, uni. if it's not too late, drop the classes you're behind in, i'm assuming your grades are crappy. it's ok, classes can be retaken. no biggie, it'll be ok.

most of all, take a little time out and have a deep breath, you dont have to do everything at once. it's not hopeless when you break it down into itty bitty little steps. 

like /u/Yveris, when i had my breakdown, it wasnt pretty. i holed up in my apartment for two months during my awkward, inbetweeny stage. i popped a lot of Xanax because i was having panic attacks ALL the time. almost lost my job, almost got kicked out of my apartment. urgh, those were NOT fun times.

but i CAN tell you is that when i got thru that, it started getting easier, i stopped getting the stares and everybody just started gendering me female.

you can do this too. you gotta just look to what your next step is, just work to cross that thing off your list. you gotta do it one step at a time.

you can do this.

Resolution: Removing Financial Barriers to Care for Transgender Patients (2008)  
An established body of medical research demonstrates the effectiveness and medical necessity of mental health care, hormone therapy and sex reassignment surgery as forms of therapeutic treatment for many people diagnosed with GID Therefore, be it
RESOLVED, that the AMA supports public and private health insurance coverage for  treatment of gender identity disorder.
http://www.tgender.net/taw/ama_resolutions.pdf  
Resolution H-185.950: Removing Financial Barriers to Care for Transgender Patients (2008)  
Our AMA supports public and private health insurance coverage for treatment of gender identity disorder as recommended by the patients physician. (Res. 122; A-08)  
http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/PolicyFinder/policyfiles/HnE/H-185.950.HTM

**American Psychiatric Association**  
Position Statement on Access to Care for Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals (2012)  
 The American Psychiatric Association:  
1. Recognizes that appropriately evaluated transgender and gender variant individuals can benefit greatly from medical and surgical gender transition treatments.  
2. Advocates for removal of barriers to care and supports both public and private health insurance coverage for gender transition treatment.  
3. Opposes categorical exclusions of coverage for such medically necessary treatment when prescribed by a physician.

Position Statement on Discrimination Against Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals
(2012)  
 Being transgender gender or variant implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities; however, these individuals often experience discrimination due to a lack of civil rights protections for their gender identity or expression Thus, this position statement is relevant to the APA because discrimination and lack of equal civil rights is damaging to the mental health of  transgender and gender variant individuals.  

**The American Psychiatric Association:**  
1. Supports laws that protect the civil rights of transgender and gender variant individuals.  
2. Urges the repeal of laws and policies that discriminate against transgender and gender variant individuals.  
3. Opposes all public and private discrimination against transgender and gender variant individuals in such areas as health care, employment, housing, public accommodation, education, and licensing.  
4. Declares that no burden of proof of such judgment, capacity, or reliability shall be placed upon these individuals greater than that imposed on any other persons.

American Psychological Association
Policy on Transgender, Gender Identity   Gender Expression Non-Discrimination (2008)
As stated in the Policy on Transgender, Gender Identity   Gender Expression NonDiscrimination,
the APA opposes all public and private discrimination on the basis of actual or perceived gender identity and expression and urges the repeal of discriminatory laws and policies and calls upon psychologists in their professional roles to provide appropriate, nondiscriminatory treatment to transgender and gender variant individuals and encourages psychologists to take a leadership role in working against discrimination towards transgender and gender variant individuals. 

The APA recognizes the efficacy, benefit and medical necessity of gender transition treatments for appropriately evaluated individuals and calls upon public and private insurers to cover these medically necessary treatments.  
http://www.apa.org/about/policy/transgender.aspx

**American Academy of Family Physicians**  
Resolution No. 1004 (2012)
In 2007, an AAFP Commission declared that the association has a policy opposing any
form of patient discrimination and stated its opposition to the exclusion of transgender
health care. In 2012, the organization released a new resolution: RESOLVED, That the
American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) support efforts to require insurers to
provide coverage for comprehensive care of [transgender] individuals including medical
care, screening tests based on medical need rather than gender, mental health care, and,
when medically necessary, gender reassignment surgery.

**American Academy of Physician Assistants**  
Non-Discrimination Statement  (Adopted 2000; amended 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2008)
Physician assistants should not discriminate against classes or categories of patients in the delivery of needed health care. Such classes and categories includegender identity.

**American College of Nurse Midwives**  
Transgender/Transsexual/Gender Variant Health Care (2012)
The American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM) supports efforts to provide transgender, transsexual, and gender variant individuals with access to safe, comprehensive, culturally competent health care and therefore endorses the 2011 World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care

Please see Ethical Conduct for the Physician Assistant Profession (Adopted 2000, amended 2004, 2006, 2007, and 2008) and Comprehensive Health Care Reform (Adopted 2005 and amended 2010). 

**National Association of Social Workers**  
Transgender and Gender Identity Issues Policy Statement (2008)
 NASW supports the rights of all individuals to receive health insurance and other health coverage without discrimination on the basis of gender identity, and specifically without exclusion of services related to transgender or transsexual transitionin order to receive medical and mental health services through their primary care physician and the appropriate referrals to medical specialists, which may include hormone replacement therapy, surgical interventions, prosthetic devices, and other medical procedures.

**World Professional Association for Transgender Health**  
Clarification on Medical Necessity of Treatment, Sex Reassignment, and Insurance Coverage in the U.S.A. (2008)  
WPATH found that decades of experience with the Standards of Care show gender transitions and related care to be accepted, good medical practice and effective treatment.  
In a 2008 clarification, WPATH stated:

[S]ex reassignment, properly indicated and performed as provided by the Standards of Care, has proven to be beneficial and effective in the treatment of individuals with transsexualism, gender identity disorder, and/or gender dysphoria. Sex reassignment plays an undisputed role in contributing toward favorable outcomes, and comprises Real Life Experience, legal name and sex change on identity documents, as well as medically necessary hormone treatment, counseling, psychotherapy, and other medical procedures...


The medical procedures attendant to sex reassignment are not cosmetic or elective or for the mere convenience of the patient. These reconstructive procedures are not optional in any meaningful sense, but are understood to be medically necessary for the treatment of the diagnosed condition.

**National Commission on Correctional Health Care**


Position Statement: Transgender Health Care in Correctional Settings (2009) 

The health risks of overlooking the particular needs of transgender inmates are so severe that acknowledgment of the problem and policies that assure appropriate and responsible provision of health care are needed.  
Because prisons, jails, and juvenile justice facilities have a responsibility to ensure the physical and mental health and well-being of transgender people in their custody, correctional health staff should manage these inmates in a manner that respects the
biomedical and psychological aspects of a gender identity disorder (GID) diagnosis.

<TEXT> yeesh, to tell each of the people in my inner circle, i had to practically chug an entire bottle of wine before i could send them an IM. (i was too chicken to tell them face to face. and right after i told everybody, i was even MORE terrified because there was no going back at that point. i had the whole "WHAT THE FUCK DID I JUST DO?" moment.

and the first 6 months of transition was rough, i HATED the inbetweeny stage. urgh. when people dont quite know what gender you are and they just STARE, or whisper. god i hated the whispers.

now i'm having a blast. altho i kick myself for not coming out sooner.

Fear is a bitch. </TEXT>

and yes, if a child identifies as transgender, they are taken to a therapist and if a diagnosis of gender dysphoria is given then depending on how far along puberty they are on the Tanner scale, puberty blockers or hormones are prescribed. this is true for bot transgender girls and boys.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Is it really possible for a prepubescent girl to be trans?

yes

and stop mixing up sexuality and gender, those are distinct from one another.

[Children as young as two can struggle with gender identity](http://www.wdbj7.com/news/local/early-years-children-as-young-as-two-can-struggle-with-gender-identity/33124652)

Wouldn't it be easy for a child to fake being trans just to be a part of a club? 

ok, think about what you just asked. you're asking a child, who at that point in their life just wants to fit and with all their friends, to do something that would make them COMPLETELY different from all their friends.

besides, there are criteria that doctors and therapists use before they give a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. </TEXT>

i just ran out of energy to fight it anymore.

<TEXT> yeesh, the fear of not passing, that's a really common fear among trans people, guys and girls alike. the height isnt a big deal, just go onto /r/tall and you'll see plenty of cis girls way taller than you. hell, you'd be one of the shorties.

and as for your shoulders? [here's jesslyn](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=e7d_1298068190)

never doubt the power of hormones, makeup, and the right clothes.

i was terrified of not being able to pass as female. my therapist suggested very firmly that i start seeing her in girlmode, and for the first few times, i hid behind a hat and sunglasses, and i practically RAN to her office. she had a helpful piece of advice, she called what i was experiencing Other People's Disease. and she was right, i was transitioning because i was trans, not to pass some arbitrary standard of some nebulous concept in my head of what an ideal female was supposed to look like. once you start owning who you are, it gets easier to deal. "passing" for what it is worth, comes a lot of the time just from confidence and a little slight of hand. like i said, hormones, makeup, and the right clothes.

so, if you decide to join us on the journey to planet girl, feel free to send me a PM if you wanna talk, or post another question here, there'll always be someone here to help

<TEXT> The typical American woman will have two children in her lifetime. That means she will spend more than three decades trying to avoid pregnancy.

The most effective contraceptives are IUDs and implants. These methods are up to 20 times more effective than the birth control pill in preventing pregnancy, and they are often the safest options for women.

But high up-front costs put these methods out of reach for a lot of women. Insurance coverage for contraception without a co-pay would allow a woman to choose the best method for her, not just what fits in her budget. Taking away coverage would effectively block access to those most-effective methods.

Birth control is not only safe and effective preventive care, it is also care that physicians support and millions of women need. Allowing an employer's personal values to trump his or her employees' right to care would allow the beliefs of the few to trump the health of many. That's both bad policy and bad medicine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Women like their birth control:**

* 99% of women who have had sex have used contraceptives at some point. Its already a near-universal practice.

* Opponents of contraceptive coverage are in the minority. In a recent NPRThompson Reuters poll, 77% of respondents said that private insurance plans should cover some or all of the cost of birth control pills. If the plan is subsidized by the government, 74% of respondents thought it should cover some or all of the cost.

* Women who have used birth control pills have been found to have fewer cases of anemia (low red blood cells), ovarian cancer, and uterine cancer. These beneficial effects occur because the birth control pill works by decreasing the number of ovulations, amount of menstrual blood flow, and frequency of periods.

* Taking the Pill helps prevent or reduce the occurrence of functional cysts (the most common kind of ovarian cyst), which form when ovulation goes awry.

* Oral contraceptives are also used to treat cystic acne, a potentially scarring condition that affects women even into their forties.

**Why we need birth control:**

* Half of pregnancies among American women are unplanned. Of unplanned pregnancies, 4 in 10 end in abortion. Preventing unplanned pregnancy prevents abortions.

* Contraception is estimated to save $19 billion a year in costs related to unplanned pregnancies. Increasing access will increase savings.

* Contraception supports and improves women and childrens health outcomes by enabling women to plan the spacing and timing of their pregnancies. It is also used to address health issues such as preventing ovarian cysts or endometrial and ovarian cancers.

* Access to free birth control leads to lower rates of abortions and teen births, according to a new and extensive study from Washington University in St. Louis.

* The average cost per publicly financed unintended pregnancy is nearly $10,000.

* New York Citys teen pregnancy rate has decreased by 27% over the past decade. And Health Commissioner Tom Farley attributes the change, in part, to the provision of contraceptives in public schools. </TEXT>

and we can bring back slavery, right?

<TEXT> yes, people like you like to think that trans women go around and hang out in bars for the sole purpose of "tricking" men into sleeping with them. 

trans women are women, and there are plenty of men who think so. they just have to weed out the bigots like you.

<TEXT> By the end of the 19th century, medicine and psychiatry were effectively competing with religion and the law for jurisdiction over sexuality. Thankfully, science won out. Early in the twentieth century, Havelock Ellis argued that homosexuality was inborn and therefore not immoral, that it was not a disease, and that many homosexuals made outstanding contributions to society.

Yes, they were wrong about a lot of things back then, and as science and medicine advance, our knowledge expands, and treatments, diagnoses, and definitions change. Religion, on the other hand, does not.

I live in a world of reason and logic. and there is no scientific basis for the need, or for that matter, the ability, to change a person's sexuality. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Freud believed that a homosexual orientation should not be viewed as a form of pathology.

"Homosexuality is assuredly no advantage, but it is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation, it cannot be classified as an illness; we consider it to be a variation of the sexual function produced by a certain arrest of sexual development. Many highly respectable individuals of ancient and modern times have been homosexuals, several of the greatest men among them (Plato, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, etc.). It is a great injustice to persecute homosexuality as a crime, and cruelty too...."

Homosexuality was removed from the DSM because it was never an illness in the first place. </TEXT>

There is a debate in the medical and transgender communities about whether or not Gender Dysphoria should remain in the DSM.

but you go right ahead and keep calling the WPATH a "political" organization. in the meanwhile, here's more:- 

The American Psychological Association is the largest scientific and professional organization representing psychology in the United States, with more than 122,500 researchers, educators, clinicians, consultants and students as its members.

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), people who experience intense, persistent gender incongruence can be given the diagnosis of "gender dysphoria."

A psychological state is considered a mental disorder only if it causes significant distress or disability. Many transgender people do not experience their gender as distressing or disabling, which implies that identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder.

<TEXT> Researchers adept at analyzing the genetic threads of human diversity say that the concept of race--the source of abiding cultural and political divisions in American society--simply has no basis in fundamental human biology.

With the tools of molecular biology, scientists can peer past superficial characteristics to explore more powerful, underlying genetic commonalities and differences, which are making racial categories look increasingly arbitrary and irrelevant, the experts said.

"Biologically, we are saying in essence that race is no longer a valid scientific distinction," said Solomon H. Katz, a University of Pennsylvania anthropologist.

"Race is a social construct derived mainly from perceptions conditioned by events of recorded history, and it has no basic biological reality," said C. Loring Brace, a biological anthropologist at the University of Michigan.

"The old biological definitions of race were based on what people looked like," said Joseph L. Graves Jr., an evolutionary biologist at Arizona State University West. "Now that we have better ways of looking at race . . . we could construct races based on what type of fingerprints people have, or on what kind of blood type they have, and that would be just as legitimate." </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is no single explanation for why some people are transgender. The diversity of transgender expression and experiences argues against any simple or unitary explanation. Many experts believe that biological factors such as genetic influences and prenatal hormone levels, early experiences, and experiences later in adolescence or adulthood may all contribute to the development of transgender identities.

A psychological state is considered a mental disorder only if it causes significant distress or disability. Many transgender people do not experience their gender as distressing or disabling, which implies that identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder. For these individuals, the significant problem is finding affordable resources, such as counseling, hormone therapy, medical procedures and the social support necessary to freely express their gender identity and minimize discrimination. Many other obstacles may lead to distress, including a lack of acceptance within society, direct or indirect experiences with discrimination, or assault. These experiences may lead many transgender people to suffer with anxiety, depression or related disorders at higher rates than nontransgender persons.

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), people who experience intense, persistent gender incongruence can be given the diagnosis of "gender dysphoria." Some contend that the diagnosis inappropriately pathologizes gender noncongruence and should be eliminated. Others argue that it is essential to retain the diagnosis to ensure access to care. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is under revision and there may be changes to its current classification of intense persistent gender incongruence as "gender identity disorder."

<TEXT>  There ARE documented cases of success with conversion therapy.

no, no there arent. nada. zip. zero.

The most important fact about these therapies is that they are based on a view of homosexuality that has been rejected by all the major mental health professions. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, six published by the American Psychiatric Association, which defines the standards of the field, does not include homosexuality. All other major health professional organizations have supported the American Psychiatric Association in its declassification of homosexuality as a mental disorder in 1973. Thus, the idea that homosexuality is a mental disorder or that the emergence of same-sex attraction and orientation among some adolescents is in any way abnormal or mentally unhealthy has no support among any mainstream health and mental health professional organizations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The WPATH Standards of Care for Gender Identity Disorders were first issued in 1979, and articulate the "professional consensus about the psychiatric, psychological, medical and surgical management of GID." Periodically revised to reflect the latest clinical practice and scientific research, the Standards also unequivocally reflect the Association's conclusion that treatment is medically necessary.

Sex (gender) reassignment, properly indicated and performed as provided by the Standards of Care, has proven to be beneficial and effective in the treatment of individuals with transsexualism, gender identity disorder, and/or gender dysphoria. Sex reassignment plays an undisputed role in contributing toward favorable outcomes, and comprises Real Life Experience, legal name and sex change on identity documents, as well as medically necessary hormone treatment, counseling, psychotherapy, and other medical procedures. Genital reconstruction is not required for social gender recognition, and such surgery should not be a prerequisite for document or record changes; the Real Life Experience component of the transition process is crucial to psychological adjustment, and is usually completed prior to any genital reconstruction, when appropriate for the patient, according to the WPATH Standards of Care. Changes to documentation are important aids to social functioning, and are a necessary component of the pre-surgical process; delay of document changes may have a deleterious impact on a patient's social integration and personal safety.

 

Medically necessary sex reassignment procedures also include complete hysterectomy, bilateral mastectomy, chest reconstruction or augmentation as appropriate to each patient (including breast prostheses if necessary), genital reconstruction (by various techniques which must be appropriate to each patient, including, for example, skin flap hair removal, penile and testicular prostheses, as necessary), facial hair removal, and certain facial plastic reconstruction as appropriate to the patient.

"Non-genital surgical procedures are routinely performed... notably, subcutaneous mastectomy in female-to-male transsexuals, and facial feminization surgery, and/or breast augmentation in male-to-female transsexuals. These surgical interventions are often of greater practical significance in the patient's daily life than reconstruction of the genitals." 


Furthermore, not every patient will have a medical need for identical procedures; clinically appropriate treatments must be determined on an individualized basis with the patient's physician. </TEXT>

opinions like yours are fast fading into memory. and while they'll prolly always be around, just like racism is still with us, they will be reviled for the homophobic and transphobic thought that they are.

there are more people today who fight for equality than there are people like you tryin g to sow hate and fear and division. that's why we're winning and that's why we will continue to win. inclusion helps everybody feel a part from society, exclusionary ideas that you push, just isolate you more and more. </TEXT>
