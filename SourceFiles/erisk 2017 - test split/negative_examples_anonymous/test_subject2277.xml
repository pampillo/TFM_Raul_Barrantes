I stand corrected.

I don't know if he was necessarily deliberately getting her out of the view of the camera or if he simply wanted to deal with her off the roadway.

Either way, you're correct, he told her to go over there.

I am a member and regular donor to the NDP and am both pleasantly surprised and thrilled at the direction our future PM is taking the party.

If you want to win, you must campaign from the centre, as you will lure both centre right and centre left undecided voters that are necessary for a win.

Do you want change or do you want more Harper?

If you want change, follow Mulcairs lead.

Edit - For my party, the fringe left ( which is in abundance on/r/Canada) does as much harm to it, as the fringe right does to Harpers brand.

I know, the truth hurts.  If I wanted to turn an undecided voter off my party, I'd sent her to /r/Canada. </TEXT>

58,243,056 are men.

In 6 months, 1300 farmers have killed themselves.

" So in just six months this year, the farmer suicide toll has already touched 66% of the 1,981 cases recorded in the entire year of 2014."

Last year, 1981 farmers killed themselves in that state.

Yep, it's a problem.

There **should** be a mechanism in place to suspend officers without pay on a case by case basis.

No such mechanism exists, so dirty and corrupt cops get their top base salary of 90K while they work their way through the system.

So, the government needs to legislate this power, that is currently unavailable to police Chiefs.

The Ontario Association of Chiefs want the ability to suspend with pay on a case by case basis. </TEXT>
