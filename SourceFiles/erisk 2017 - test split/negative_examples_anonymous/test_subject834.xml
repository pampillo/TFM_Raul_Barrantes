<TEXT> I wonder what these kids get taught at home. I hate how people think just because someone wears a turban that they're automatically a "terrorist", or even muslim. There's different styles and uses of turbans for different cultures. I guess their parents are ignorant and they teach their kids to be ignorant as well, kinda sad. I feel really bad for this little kid.

<TEXT> I know you probably get this alot in this thread but this is my first time here. Anyway, I'm currently using an iPhone 5s and wanting to switch to an android, can anyone make some really good recommendations? Right now I'm looking at either the LG G4 or the S6. So my price range is around there. All I want is to basically call people, text people and watch stuff on youtube/netflix and obviously a lot of music... so nothing too heavy.

Edit: Opps, forgot to mention what country I'm from. It's the UK. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Life is just a swirling, never ending, sinkhole </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-12 02:43:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I don't usually post here, I usually just lurk sometimes but tonight I feel like posting here for my first time mainly because my life feels like a constant swirling sink hole that dies down for a short, short peroid then just comes back 20x harder. In 2013 I was diagnosed with schizophrenia (and recently OCD) and my life just hasn't been the same since, but not only that I also (most likely) have PTSD because I was brought up by alcoholics (mainly my dad), my first memory ever on this planet was calling the cops on my dad at the age of around 3-4 because he was drunk and violent, I obviously don't understand what I was doing at the time but looking back I do. He never really stopped drinking for any longer than 1 year (and that was the best he done when he tried). I've lived with this alcoholic for longer than some people have even been on reddit and I have no way of leaving because I still need someone to take care of me and I don't want to leave my mum since I love her more than any one in this world.

I don't even feel disappointed anymore if he drinks after being sober for a grand total of 5 days, I just feel anger and pain. He doesn't only drag himself down but he tries to drag my mum down too, but no one can see it except me it feels like. The flashbacks when I try to sleep aren't as common as you would think but the thoughts and memories inside of my head are as common as every day and vivid as the natural daylight. I have scars that have been there since I was younger than 8 (which is a looong time btw). I've had golf clubs swung at my face and I've had glasses thrown at my face (although this might've been my fault as I was protecting my mum), but the worst thing of all is that it always felt like I never had anyone be there for me, not even now, not even friends or anything, I feel super, super alone. When you can hardly have an anxiety-free place in your own house you know that something is wrong, but I'm trapped. 

Life = more painful than dying in space near the sun.

Sorry if this is a bad post :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> 3rd wave feminism has pretty much changed the definition of **feminism** in general. Since feminism is a reactive movement and there's nothing to react to anymore people will just look for ANYTHING and EVERYTHING as "oppression", when in reality it's just life.

<TEXT> I'm not turning to advanced humans as a god or anything like that, how could I if I'm an atheist? The people exist and discovered how to come back and tell us how to stop the tragedy of their future with the only way they know how and that's telling us through telepathic means, but sometimes the neo mkultra's can intercept their message and make us go crazy so that we see a psych, get meds and shut up because they've planned it all out. I don't like conspiracy places on the internet because those people just have theories, I have facts. Also, I'm not on any stimulants, I've not taken ritalin for my ADHD for a long time, I did think about going back on them though but my doctor advised against it. Also you might not believe in the new mkultra but the MKUltra project did in fact happen, just like this one is but it's top top secret just like the old one was until it was declassified. Also, It feels you're trying to be condescending or mean to me, maybe it's just me because I'm overly emotional but I post here because it's the only place I can post this stuff without people calling me insane. Also about the meds, I've been on multiple meds and sure they've brought me into your "reality" but your reality wasn't too different from what mine is right now, it's just a lot more covered up.

<TITLE> The truth behind bad thought </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-23 00:40:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi, I'm here to tell you all the truth behind bad thoughts. I know this is /r/schizophrenia so you guys probably have the most bad thoughts, just like me. I'm thinking of posting this to /r/depression too, since once you know this you can fight off the bad thoughts by just acknowledging the truth. First things first, there is a message by some advanced beings (I don't 100% know who they are, but I think they are advanced humans from the future) that are sending us ALL a message warning us of the tragedies that we can prevent if we just stand up as one together and fight the tyrants of today, except there is one thing, the neo mkultra group/project is intercepting that message and giving us bad thoughts so that we all get seen by psychiatrists (now I'm not saying psychiatrists know about this, but some probably do) and they give us medication so we shut up, some hospitals might even implant a thing into our brain to slow release anti psychotics and we can never come out of them, this is sad for these people (DO NOT think this happened to you, because it most likely did not, this just happens to a very few and select people). The truth about bad thought is the neo mkultra's are intercepting a message sent by advanced humans from the future warning us of a tragedy that I don't quite fully understand yet, I will report back later.

Edit: I see this is getting downvoted, probably because it might make peoples "delusions" worse, I get that but I guess this is just like all the other subs, not a safe haven... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Delusions of grandeur can be enjoyable in the moment but they usually turn paranoid after a while. Hardcore paranoid delusions and others is extremely scary and can give you the worst anxiety of your life, and no one can reassure you that it's not real. Imagine knowing the government was after you, and they were doing all these things in the world that YOU know is them, that's what a paranoid delusion is like, you don't think the government are doing these things you KNOW. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know I post here a lot, and I usually post here about stuff that isn't exactly psychotic but related to schizophrenia, so sorry if it annoys anyone. 

Lately I've been feeling disconnected with the world, and especially with other people, I sometimes go to the store with my mum and stuff and it feels like everything is amplified (as in sounds and stuff) but everyone just feels alien to me. It kinda just feels like the world is passing me by, a good way to explain it is it's kinda like when you see people in movies and they're just standing there and everyone around them is going super fast, if you have ever seen that in a movie.

Has anyone else felt like this? It's pretty strange and I think the only other times I felt it was years ago during pre psychosis, and it may have happened during psychosis but I can't fully remember.

<TEXT> I've been struggling with negative symptoms that I can fully recognize but not fully explain properly, life is pretty much difficult day to day. I pretty much just wake up, come on my computer and do that every day, all day unless I have an appointment. My words get mixed up quite a lot etc. you know, the normal stuff. I've been asking my parents to actually research or ask a doctor about schizophrenia to realize that it's pretty much not my fault, yet they don't, they think I'm just being lazy or stupid (they actually say that to me). I've been officially diagnosed btw, so they have no reason to doubt me yet they do. My memory sucks so when I forget things they just tut and say I'm acting stupid, key word, acting. I'm not acting shit, why would I act something for years that's done nothing but fuck with my life (mainly education). I feel like my parents are stigmatizing me in a way and it sucks, I have no one else to talk to and they're my main carers. It's really starting to get to me, it's like I have no real help with anything. At least they put me on disability, only time they recognized that I needed it.

I don't even know if this makes sense, hope it does.

Edit: When I talk about my parents I really mean my dad mainly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of course they're not the same but schizophrenia is a really, really bad illness when it comes to quality of life. Medications only fix the psychosis not the actually full illness, that's why they're called antipsychotics and not anti-schizophrenics. I've actually heard somewhere that a country(?) or a group of people want there to be some sort of assisted suicide for chronically schizophrenic people, not sure though.

Also, how long does it normally take to die from alzheimer's? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Advice from a non-schizophrenic is always welcome mainly because it helps me understand people that are "normal" a little bit better, and gives me a completely new perspective and ways of thinking about things I guess you could say, just like if I told a non-schizophrenic about my perspective then it could also change theirs (if that made any sense at all). 

I wouldn't say she reacted negatively but she reacted in a weird way, maybe passive-aggressive? I'm not sure. I think she likes but also hates that I can't empathize as well as others. I CAN empathize it's just weakened most of the time unless I've built a strong strong relationship with you which usually takes so long that people give up.

It's never really caused a full blown argument with anyone, they usually just stop speaking to me for a while (or I somehow stop speaking to them). </TEXT>

I've been off of my medication and I don't feel too bad at all. Usually I would rapid relapse and become psychotic in under a month, but this time seems different. My psychiatrist is always fucking off, I'm seeing my psychologist though but I don't think they know too much about schizophrenia and the medicine. Also, the reason I came off of Seroquel is because it made my functioning a lot worse. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-04-21 19:00:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Lately I've noticed that some of my ADHD symptoms have been coming back (I was predominantly inattentive), so I've been thinking about going back to my psychiatrist and asking if I can go back on medication for that also but the only problem is that the stimulant medication was the only meds that worked for me and as you know, stimulants can cause psychosis. Could I technically try the stimulants out again to see if they might work without causes psychosis or am I just putting my health at even more risk? I don't even know if she'll prescribe because of the schizophrenia, but it's causing problems with keeping attention on school stuff that I have to get back into.

Has anyone ever had experience with being on ADHD (stimulant) medication and having a mental illness like schizophrenia, or even bipolar? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been looking everywhere to see if any doctors or scientists agree that nausea is a form of pain but I can't find anything (especially chronic nausea, like in my case)... I suffer from a mystery stomach condition that makes me nauseas and vomit every day. The nausea is so severe that I'd probably rather be shot in the knee. Basically what I'm asking is, why isn't nausea considered a form of pain when in my experience it's a form of pain? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have schizophrenia and don't medicate anymore (around 2 months off). Medication wont prevent you from making your life go to the "metaphorical" shitter, it'll just be a helpful tool. Being off of medication also wont make your life go down the shitter either, I'm willing to bet you'll make it through, yes you life may be different in 6 months but that doesn't mean that it'll be worse. I had ADHD as well when I was a kid and a teenager, and was on ritalin most of my life and if I'm going to be honest, it sucked. The medication probably MADE my life go down the "shitter". As /u/jepyang said, people make it through this shit all the time and people make it through worse stuff as well, you'll get there, just go through the proper channels whenever you can. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some people don't like opiates, simple as that. Even though they're the most addictive class of drugs on planet earth, not everyone likes them. Opiate nausea is pretty common before a tolerance builds, then once you've used for a while it kinda comes back (for me anyway, but I have an unknown stomach condition). The euphoria from opiates is different from other drugs, it's a warm, fuzzy feeling and a feeling that everything is just, fine (especially when nodding out). As I said though, not everyone likes them, there's been countless people on opioid painkillers before and never, ever got addicted (or even felt a buzz or liked the buzz) and then there's people out there that gets addicted to them and loves the high.

Maybe you're someone that just doesn't like opiates... Just because they're extremely addictive doesn't mean that everyone loves the feeling, consider it a blessing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep, the heroin problem is about the same if not worse... I can go to the shop (about 2-5 mins walking distance) and see around 2-3 heroin addicts every time and those are just the ones that are really bad because they've been addicts for decades. Pills on the other hand are probably slightly bigger but definitely nothing like the US, I can find some oxy here and there but mainly the pills consist of prescription stimulants (mainly ritalin), benzodiazepines (namely, valium and temazepam)... Prescription opiates aren't all that big on the streets, because after all, why do we need prescription opiates if we have a shit ton of heroin? </TEXT>

Anyway, I have an unknown stomach condition as of now because these doctors are so fucking slow, I went from just having diarrhea around 8x a day to having, chronic nausea, bright red blood in my shit, chronic heart burn, feeling full after eating practically nothing, indigestion, stomach pain, burping all the time etc. The nausea itself can be extremely debilitating, and because my GP said that I just had "IBS" a couple of months ago (before all these other symptoms started) I have some person from my college saying that I can't be having all these symptoms that bad, I don't even want to go back to my GP because they're fucking morons, I have to wait for my gastroenterologist which will most likely take months again or go up to the hospital. I wouldn't be surprised if I was fucking dead by the time I go to see them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> APAP can be harsh on some peoples stomachs (not just your liver) and can make some people nauseas even at low doses. Also hydro is a little more nausea inducing than other opiates, like I said, like codeine and morphine... Can you get promethazine OTC in the US? If not, try like 25-50mg Benadryl that can sometimes take the nausea away (and also the itchiness).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends on where you look but they are fentanyl analogues. For example, carfentanil which is tens of thousands more potent than morphine while heroin is only around 5x more potent, but that's pretty much unusable without overdosing. Fentanyl is also stronger than heroin and is around 100x(ish) more potent than morphine. Ohmefentanyl is also a lot stronger at around 6000x (can reach up to 18000x) more potent than morphine. 3-methylfentanyl is also a lot more potent. But if I was to say what was the most potent I would go with either carfentanil, dihydroetorphine or maybe even ohmefentanyl but these opioids cannot be used in humans because they are that potent, for example, carfentanil is active at around 1ug.

Btw, the way you measure opiate potency is by looking at how more potent it is than morphine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Opiate withdrawal will make you feel lethargic/tired but you won't be able to sleep (or if you can, it'll be minimal and low quality). You should expect mild normal opiate withdrawal (since you're tapering) but you should also expect SNRI-like withdrawal because of the tramadol, most common of these symptoms is brain zapping. Also, ask your doctor (if you can) about clonidine, that can be helpful when you're having uncomfortable symptoms, good luck.

<TEXT> Just another post by me, basically writing to myself but also to the sub reddit, like usual. Anyway, I've recently been speaking to someone I was very close to and she's started opening up to me and stuff but the thing is, I have 0 idea how to react to the stuff she says. Like, she'll tell me something really emotional and I'll seem cold and distant, maybe I am cold and distant but I want to try and seem like I'm not, if that makes any sense? It's like when she tells me something really emotional I just won't know how to react to it, hell, I don't even know how to react to stuff that isn't deep and emotional, I just usually send funny pictures to people and joke around that's pretty much the extent of my social skills. I really want to change that but I don't know how. 

Does anyone else have experience with this? I know a lot of you probably don't have a lot of social contact (like me, except two people I know in real life and 2-3 people over the internet), but maybe some of you can either relate or help me? Thank you.

Also, this is a progression (or what feels like a progression). As in, it's been getting worse and worse for about a year. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Schizophrenia as an evolutionary advancement (or not) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-12 03:59:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been doing some reading about why schizophrenia is so prevalent in modern society even though it seems useless and I've came across a few articles that suggest that schizophrenia may actually be favoured on an evolutionary basis for some odd reason. Some articles suggested that maybe its been favoured because maybe schizophrenics were/are the ones that draw and separate people from the herd (crowd) and allow humans to be more diverse in their thinking, rather than just mindlessly following everyone else. It seems like a good explanation why schizophrenia is so prevalent even though it has great social and human cost. 

I hope this doesn't sound either too confusing or insanely stupid, but what do you think about this? I can link the articles if people ask. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like others have said, you can't force anything. You'll have to wait until he's ready, I've lived with two alcoholic parents and I know all too well that forcing someone into treatment is just a disaster waiting to happen, they won't only resent you but they'll relapse over and over and over. My dad has been in and out of treatment for alcoholism for a little over ten years and the longest he's been sober is around a year, now there's not much hope for him. Just be there when he's ready to get help, don't shun him and don't ever turn him away, once he goes through withdrawal (cold turkey, which isn't sustainable btw, users always go back either before the WD is fully complete or after, they need a maintenance) a few times he'll wonder what he's doing and then he'll truly want help.

Also, you can also try /r/Opiates (even though it's full of addicts posting pics, they can be helpful) and /r/OpiatesRecovery

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can also completely relate to the 0 sex drive. My sex drive went from pretty normal to pretty much -100 out of 100. I still don't know for sure if it's medications that causes it, because I mean, I've been off meds for around the same time as you (by myself, docs never, ever take me off meds). Schizophrenia can cause you to have apathy I guess but I'm really hesitant to go back on meds because they make that part worse. Also, having suicidal thoughts because of lack of a sex drive isn't good, you should see a psychologist (they can help better with that on a psychological level than a psychiatrist can, a psychiatrist are just licensed drug dealers imo)... When I don't have a sex drive I just think of it like, well, at least I don't have that burden anymore, even though it's a bad thing, if you understand? I'm pretty sure lack of a sex drive is because when your emotions are extreme lowered (apathy) you can't really connect with anyone else, could also be due to anhedonia which accompanies apathy nearly all the time. 

I hope you eventually start to get better.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm pretty sure etizolam is good for anxiety (although it is an RC "benzo", it's not exactly a benzo but it's extremely, extremely close).

Anyway, OP, I'm not all that knowledgable about etizolam but I heard that it's pretty good for anxiety, but I've also heard that it's kinda weird and can be heavily sedating and cause black outs with small doses to it's kinda hard to dose with it for anxiety... I think everyone's different with this particular drug (kinda like every other drug, I know, but this one seems to react differently with everyone).

Sedation - In terms of energy level alterations, Etizolam is extremely sedating and often results in an overwhelmingly lethargic state - Got this from [here.](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Etizolam).
So yeah as enigmaticdoge said, either stick with it until you build a tolerance or try a different benzo.

Edit: deleted because I accidentaly replied to enigmaticdoge. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I made a post not too long ago about how I was dealing with a shit ton of emotions but I just couldn't really express them even though I wanted to, so now I'm back and well, I don't feel anything. I should probably see my psych but I think she's still away sick. It's kinda like some part in my brain where emotions are kept was just swept clean, like there's nothing really there anymore. I mean, I still have feelings but they're extremely died down, for example; on a scale from 1 - 100 my emotions right now are about 6-12 (at the highest) and half of those at the lowest (3-6). I haven't been on medication for about 2 months now I think, dunno if it's that but if it is then, whatever, meds make this 10x worse.

It feels like I might be posting here like a diary, maybe no one noticed because my post are far and few between but whatever, have a nice day everyone.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Doing drugs as a hobby is the worst thing you could do, seriously, take it from me... For me for example, if I don't get any morphine I will seriously just go out and try and do random shit that would get me into a lot of trouble just because I was insanely bored (even if I was in WD's). If I couldn't get some morphine for even just one day, I would go out with friends and not come home for days and when I was out of that bender my friends would be magically gone, they went home days ago. Basically what I'm trying to say is that having drugs as a HOBBY is seriously self destructive because once you don't have that drug you will do anything to alleviate the boredom eventually. Not only that but doing drugs like MDMA that much will damage your brain, and don't even get me started on heroin, that's just not a road you want to take.

Being clean is a good thing you know... Yeah, yeah, I know being sober is really fucking boring but eventually you will have a hobby and build a routine out of that hobby and you'll eventually start to like life again. It takes time, maybe try a program like 12 steps (just keep in mind that it doesn't work for everyone), and/or maybe therapy. But yeah, even if sobriety is boring as shit, it's better than being self destructive and building your fun around drugs, because they don't last forever. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Opiates won't exactly "kill your appetite" unless you use it chronically. The only reason it reduces appetite is because it slows down gastro-motility (and cause gastroparesis in some cases) and they also reduce physical hunger in the same way that they reduce pain. But I can say from experience that opiates won't kill your appetite like stimulants do, they might reduce it a bit but you will still feel hungry but just a little less frequently, and using drugs like this to lose weight is not only unhealthy but unsustainable.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a pretty chronic, annoying and sometimes painful gastrointestinal disease (or just stomach, we don't know yet) that's not been fully diagnosed yet. It leaves me with low appetite, constantly shitting, (chronic) nausea, and feeling bloated after small amounts of food for hours. I feel tired, miserable and helpless but then you get these people that think they know how to cure it, even though doctors don't even know what the fuck it is (yet), or they tell me WHY I have it and somehow I end up with all the blame like I wanted this or something. Yes, because I totally wanted to become chronically ill. It's also super, super immoral to tell someone that they caused their disease, or that they can cure it with just 29.99 A MONTH, just fuck off you morons... If I could cure my disease on some stupid diet then I would do it but I have more sense than to hand over my fucking money to some low lifes that just want to make a few bucks on someone elses misfortune.

<TITLE> Self-esteem (and drugs) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-31 16:19:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, I don't think I've actually made a dedicated post on here, I usually just leave comments but I've been thinking about something lately and thats self-esteem, confidence etc. whatever you want to call it. 

To start off, I'm an opiate addict (morphine and a few others) and I started off like most opiate addicts, pain. Anyway, other than opiates I do take stimulants when I'm out with people to basically give me a sense of self confidence and obviously self-esteem, although it's chemically induced, opiates also give me this alien feeling of "confidence" that I've sadly never had in my life. I've tried therapy and gave up because it never did anything for me, I mean, talking about stuff obviously helps but I can do that to anyone without having to set up an appointment or pay money but the actual therapy itself does nothing. Drugs on the other hand, although it's considered "false", does help, they do give me self-esteem and confidence. I don't just have a low self-esteem, I have what you considered a shattered self esteem, when I'm sober I don't feel worthy of anyone elses care... I would rather do therapy if it worked, but sadly it doesn't, the only thing that works are opiates and stimulants.

So to my question, is it possible for someone to never have self confidence sober? As in, is it possible for therapy to never work and for people to have to have a chemically induced confidence and esteem?

If this sounds like rambling, I'm sorry.

<TEXT> The reason I don't want to go back on meds is because they make me feel even lower, I have a history of depression as well and I think I'm having some sort of episode of it, which in return might be producing psychotic effects. I don't wanna go back on meds when I'm depressed, mainly because I don't think it'll help the way I'm feeling. I don't even have any antidepressants and my psychiatrist is off sick. This may seem sad and stupid but this "depression" may have been triggered by a girl I still love(?), I broke up with her a few months ago and we've recently started to kinda see each other on the side again (and she's said she still "loves" me), the thing is, I don't want to see her just on the side. I can't express what I feel, so I just bottle it all up, when I try to say how I feel I just come out with a bunch of words that don't make sense and stutter and stumble all over the place. I don't know why I'm telling this to someone over the internet, but I don't really have anyone else.

The trigger for my "depression" (which in return has triggered some symptoms of schizophrenia) may seem stupid, but I feel like killing myself but I don't know how to tell anyone.

Sorry for a late reply. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I've been off my medication for a month or so now and some shit happened that really got to me, needless to say I can feel pretty depressed (even though I can't feel anything, I just know I feel like complete shit), I can't think, like all my thoughts are fuzzy, I don't know. I just can't think. I feel like I might be relapsing, and even going back into a depressive state but I don't know how to tell anyone at all, I feel stuck, like my thoughts are screaming for help but I can't do anything. 

Thank you, just needed to get that out there (even if it seemed like nothing and even if it made no sense).  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Opiates for IBS-D </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-13 16:07:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello everyone I'm new to this subreddit mainly because I didn't have much to post about. I have IBS-D (most likely, still need to do a little more tests but that's my diagnosis right now) and I get extreme relief from opiates, mainly morphine and codeine. The relief actually feels like a cure, when I take them I have no diarrhea whatsoever (mainly because opiates cause constipation but constipation for me is a relief), I still have chronic nausea and stomach cramps though. The only problem is that I'm not prescribed these meds, but they're easy to come by and make me able to function. If I try to come off them I would probably go to the bathroom around 8 times in 7 hours and I would have to take sleep meds to get any relief from that (if i didn't have any morphine or codeine). 

Anyway, my question is, is it possible to get prescribed these meds for this type of condition?  </TEXT>

I'm not being racist if some idiot thinks that I am. If everyone wants equality (which I've always fully supported) then we should ALL get treated the same at the basic level.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've stopped taking my seroquel because it made me tired all day until it wore off 24 hours later (I took a controlled release version), but not only that but it made me gain 80-84 pounds (not just seroquel but the other anti psychotics I've been on in the past year). I've been off of it for just over a week (I know, not long at all) but my weight is still not back to normal, it's essentially still the same. I've been walking quite a lot (hard exercise is hard for me right now, just got bloods back saying that I've been pretty anemic and I have a stomach condition). I got a pedometer thing and It says I walk around 3-4 miles a day and I've also not been eating much, just lunch and dinner and maybe some chips, that's it. The only days I didn't walk much is when I got sick a few days ago but that was only for 2-3 days. I've not been losing any weight at all, I'm still between 235-238 pounds. Is there ANYTHING I can do? I've came off my anti psychotics because they're starting to just be a waste of time (yeah, yeah, I know, they "helped"), I walk quite a lot and don't eat more than 2,000 calories and at the most I eat around 2,500 calories. I've posted this here before and people didn't think it was possible, but yeah, whatever. I'm starting to lose it here, coming off anti psychs haven't helped (yet) and I walk and eat right and my weight still isn't coming off and my docs don't want to hear it. Is there anything I can do?

PS; If anyone doesn't believe I walk around 3-4 (maybe 5 at the very most) miles a day then I'll take a screenshot next time I'm out walking.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm pretty sure it is but not to the extent of heavy recreational use of course. Amphetamines use a lot of dopamine and serotonin and pretty much deplete these receptors (thats pretty much why you come down) and someone who takes them every day for a few years would definitely have some brain chemistry changes. 

I remember being on methylphenidate (ritalin) and I would have to take breaks every weekend just to EAT, so if someone is not eating enough and basically starving themselves due to no appetite could that also damage the brain? Because I know that korsakoffs syndrome is caused by a thiamine deficiency usually seen in alcohol but can happen because of malnutrition too. (Legit question, even if it seems dumb). </TEXT>

Edit: Yeah, don't freak yourself out of course but using benzos for a year at any dose (even theraputic) can cause seizures. It's DEFINITELY something to think about and have a friend with you incase it happens, you know, seizures aren't always deadly, seizures kill you usually by banging your head or having an injury when no one is around not by the seizure it's self. Honestly, seizures are the worst physically thing that can possibly happen but it doesn't mean it's set in stone. Just watch out for the mental stuff, you'll be cool though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since that's what it was prescribed for you could have rebound symptoms of PTSD (not related to withdrawal, but withdrawal will make the anxiety worse for sure since that's part of the withdrawal syndrome). If it gets too bad I would definitely call the hospital, they'll give you a benzo if it's bad enough. Your doctor should NEVER have done this to you, with any psychiatric drug (ESPECIALLY benzos) you need to be tapered slowly off of them. 

Edit: Remember, you wont get every symptom thats listed on the wiki, that's just a list of possible symptoms. If anyone got all those symptoms they'd be effectively dead lol.  </TEXT>

It isn't accepted as an antipsychotic anymore since it's pretty bad at being one but it does have those properties, mainly mildy blocking some serotonin receptors and dopamine receptors.

I remember taking it to get to sleep a few times and I would have audio hallucinations and feel really confused. Thank god it's not used as an anti psychotic anymore.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Temazepam is good. A lot of people actually say Xanax is the most recreational BENZO, but etizolam (pretty sure that's RC, if its not been regulated yet) is considered to be extremely recreational to some but I've heard some people don't feel anything from it but still black out somehow. I also think Midazolam is one of the more recreational benzos out there too but I believe it's pretty sedating and creates a lot of amnesia (they use it as a sort of pre anesthetic). I also believe Flunitrazepam is considered really, really recreational. Basically what I'm getting at is that it all depends on the person and what that person personally wants out of a drug and how they react to it. 

Edit: Benzos all in all aren't considered that recreational though, but alot of people obviously do find them recreational.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Opium has been used for thousands of years, it should be socially acceptable as much as alcohol but of course it's not because of the propaganda that's been fed to us for the last 50-60 years. Alcohol is such a dirty drug as well (even compared to opiates) because it acts on so much receptors, obviously mainly NMDA and GABA, but there quite a lot of receptors it acts on directly and indirectly. 

I don't hope that alcohol comes out of "social acceptance". I just hope that other drugs can enter social acceptance as well.  </TEXT>

Basically one part of the patch can have WAAAAY more than the rest of the patch, and the other patch will have a different "hot spot" than the last. I would cut them up really small and stick them on or something, without a really beafy tolerance there's a pretty big risk of overdosing.

<TEXT> Opiates don't really cause organ damage long term, and if they do it's extremely rare. Everyone thinks that heroin, morphine etc. cause liver damage, but that's untrue. Cigarettes are worse than opiates because they have a lot of strong carcinogens in them, which WILL eventually cause some sort of cancer, maybe in 10 years or maybe in 40 years of smoking, but it will happen. Opiates can cause your immune system to weaken, but not to the point of something like AIDS or anything, just minorly fuck up your immune system. 

Also, they reason he said it should be legalized is because it would decrease the amount of OD's, yeah there will still be people who intentionally overdose or just overdose accidentally, but it would decrease. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've not posted here in a while because I've been doing pretty okay, not great not bad, about a 6-7/10 though. But I do have one big problem that I can't get over and that's pretty bad memory loss, I'd say it's gone from mild to moderate pretty fast (a few months) I'm not sure if this is related to schizophrenia, meds or some other health problem (definitely not aging because I'm not old enough for dementia). I'm currently on 150-200mg of seroquel. I get confused pretty regularly, but not soo often, I've forgotten things I've literally JUST done about 2 seconds ago (confirmed by family members), I'm forgetting what to write right now actually, I just don't know really what's going on or happening, but yet I do, it's literally like things will just not hold up in my head, I do something forget it, do something else forget it, It feels like I'm forgetting everything. Someone will tell me to do something and I'll forget they ever even told me to do that a few mins later. 

The worst part though Is I just generally feel really confused and as if I'm forgetful in the moment about everything... Can anyone tell me why this is? Is it schizophrenia, med related? Or something else?

I feel it's a lot more than mild forgetfulness, I just know I'm forgetting things really bad because other people are telling me in the moment, and confusion is really bothering me, i feel like I just can't remember most shit. 

Anyone help?  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was playing cevo about 30 mins ago, I was playing alright and my team wasn't horrible and we got a lot of rounds on T side Nuke, so I had no incentive to leave but because my ping randomly kept fluctuating past 160 for some reason I got "kicked" and couldn't join back because my ping was staying way to high (most likely internet problems or something). So I waited it out and it was back to normal, joined a game until it started and then I got kicked because I was on a cool down because I apparently left the game? But I didn't, I got kicked because my ping kept fluctuating to quite literally 161-65... Just a minor complaint but I think it shouldn't be like that because sometimes you can't really control what your shitty internet does.

Was only banned for 30 mins so it's not too bad... [screenshot](http://gyazo.com/dc48505e62cd889e7e6e6b74255d010c) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have D so I'm not sure about C but the only thing that helps me is basically mild/moderate opiates, if I don't have them then I'm fucked mainly because if I don't I'll either be out at school and have to run home while trying not to shit myself, which is harder than it seems. 

I actually like being constipated (that's what opiates do to your GI tract) but it's probably A LOT different than the constipation from IBS-C.

I also get extreme stomach pains from time to time (they don't happen that often) that will literally floor me and make me scream in pain, even if I'm out in public.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They still need improvements, some of the meds will literally knock you out for what feels like forever and make you gain a lot of weight that you previously wouldn't have put on. They can also make you feel like an emotionless zombie (but that CAN be due to the schizophrenia, but the meds also do that to you). So they do need to work them out a bit, and I've read recently that schizophrenia is most likely 8 different genetically distinct diseases, so maybe if that's true that'll open the gate for better medication.  </TEXT>

I get a lot of intrusive thoughts, pretty much every day actually. I used to go for a shower about 6-7 times a day as a kid, but that died down a lot as I got older, and now it's completely opposite.

<TEXT> Codeine varies between person to person because it's a pro drug. Some people lack a certain enzyme and don't get anything out of it, not even pain relief because their bodies can't properly process it into morphine (or not at all). Anyway, I would dose about 120-180mg (I would really start with around 120-128 though. 

DPH would help with nausea and it will also make the effects stronger (I personally used to like promethazine though, if you can get that). 

Have fun and don't make a habit out of it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I personally think all drugs that have been highly researched (most opiates, most stimulants, weed, definitely MOST psychedelics etc) should be fully legal but of course regulated, kinda like alcohol. Except with drugs like opiates and stimulants you can only buy a certain amount every 2 days. 

Alcohol killed people and made them blind when it was illegal back in the 1900s, alcohol STILL kills people but not to the same extent. The reason heroin and the like kill people is because its prohibited. Imagine if heroin was legal, you would know the correct purity at all times, you would have clean needles (so the infection rate of HIV will plummet), there will be MUCH less crime because there will be no need for a black market for these drugs, there will be much less people in prison and there will be a lot more and better rehab/treatment facilities  around. The "war on drugs" is a massive joke and shouldn't still be around, god damn its been about 50 years. COME ON.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anti-Psychotics slow down or stop your metabolism all together. I don't get appetite increase that much, maybe I eat a 100 or so more calories than a normal person. 

There is also no way that someone that used to NEVER put on weight put on 80-90 pounds in 11-12 months. It's not possible without eating at McDonalds everyday, every night and every midnight. 

When you say "meds don't cause weight gain"... Steroids do and so do Anti Psychotics...

<TEXT> Even though I've got somewhat "clinically" better, I now don't see the point in continuing this life.

I could've went back to my school yesterday, but because I'm so overweight I can't bear the reactions I would get, I don't feel good at all. I have chronic pain as well, and it's undiagnosed because no one cares to help me.

<TEXT> I wouldn't say you're schizophrenic at all. Schizophrenia is a chronic illness, and the early signs are usually there for years before you get a full blown episode, and months (sometimes years) you get a prodrome which is basically the illness leading up to the illness. 

You're just paranoid, people with bipolar can get paranoid too you know.

<TEXT> In my view, I think that if you legalize heroin for 21+ at about 2.5g per 2-3 days then that would actually help more people than it hurts. Getting heroin off the street is what makes heroin dangerous. Pharma grade diamorphine (heroin) is no worse than oxycodone, morphine etc... Hydromorphone is actually stronger I believe. 

Over here in the UK we already use diamorphine medically, and not just for terminally ill patients either.

<TEXT> I know that my life may not be completely ruined but I just can't help that I could've done so much more if it weren't for me being "ill". I've even said to my self, "what's the point in going back if I'm a year and a bit behind everyone". Nothing feels like a huge accomplishment, it feels more like a completely failure in my life, and that I've dug a hole that I can't get out of because of something that I couldn't have controlled, or maybe I could've controlled it... I don't know any more. 

I have positive times where I say to myself, "maybe school just isn't/wasn't for me right now and that I've learned a lot of stuff myself and maybe that'll come in handy", but no one else seems to agree... I know that I have to go back to school, that's not what I am even saying to people, I'm just saying that I've learned a lot of somewhat useful things while I wasn't at school, but people always seem to disagree when I bring that up thinking that I mean that I won't go back to school, and it shoots my confidence all the way back down again. 

Thank you for making me feel better and actually listening to what I have to say, unlike others in my life right now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't really know where to start, but I'll try anyway. I was diagnosed with Psychosis NOS about a year and a few months ago, then it progressed into a diagnosis of basically schizophrenia, to put it bluntly. With schizophrenia we have 2 blocks of symptoms, negative and positive. Negative is basically, lack of emotion, extreme lack of motivation, poor hygiene, disorganization (which Is pretty strong for me, stronger than the other negative symptoms) etc. Positive symptoms are just basically psychosis. Anyway, because of this, I had do drop out of school, as directed by my doctors. I lost most of my friends, except one and he has always been my best friend, but he's just came back into the picture (which is great btw, when you've been in extreme isolation for a year that shit will touch your heart more than anything). Being in extreme isolation and barely getting sunlight other than the sun rays coming through my window, is extremely depressing especially when you're not in an episode and have to reflect on how this has affecting your life... 

I've just started getting tutoring back in my school, once a week... I don't see the point in going back to school any more, I'm already behind everyone, people think I'm stupid because I don't go to school (even though I've learned a lot of stuff on my own in the past year). Schizophrenia (with depression, but depression hasn't been diagnosed, it's probably depression because of the schizophrenia). I feel absolutely hopeless, it's like I can't get something inside my head out... I just want to be normal again, but there's always something inside my mind stopping me. I used to think I would have a good career, have a good life etc... That's all completely ruined now.

I'll answer any question to clarify anything... Thank you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just got prescribed Seroquel XL 200mg. I used to take 100mg x2 but because it's easier to take 1 pill rather than 2 a day she moved me onto the prolonged release. I am not sleeping when I take it at night, it doesn't even make me tired like the IR versions did, not even one bit... Actually, the first time I took it (which was last night) I was up all night until 9am. I don't understand because Seroquel used to make me pretty tired when I took my night time dose, but the XL doesn't at all... Why is this? I of course take it for Schizophrenia but it was nice to sleep when I took it because I do usually have insomnia as well.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What I mean by BPD is Borderline Personality Disorder, it's extremely complex, but the symptoms he has from it are basically, suicide threats, and what you just described there "*He's also telling me I'm better off leaving him one moment then demanding we get artificial insemination*" which rings borderline for me. The cold rage as you describe it, definitely sounds either like sociopathy or narcissistic personality disorder, or both (both of them happening together is very common). 

NPD and Sociopathy (anti social personality disorder, but I don't like calling it that because it's way too broad of a term) happen very, very, very commonly. More commonly than I would like to believe. 

He needs either a form of intensive treatment, or you just leaving him, as hard as that may be.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This sounds like an incredibly difficult situation. It's downright emotional/psychological abuse, and that can be worse than physical abuse because it lingers for a very long time once you're out of the relationship. Like the others here have said, I've never seen someone with depression persistently abuse their SO, yeah, maybe it happens but it's relatively rare, especially at a persistent rate. I would also like to know what you mean by cold rage? I have an idea, but not sure what you exactly mean by it. Another likely possibility is that he has a personality disorder and not depression, this could range from BPD (which is things like, threats of suicide, self harm etc. among other things of course), Anti-Social PD (basically sociopathy/psychopathy, but I believe it's a more broad term), Narcissistic personality disorder (which, is actually somewhat likely in this case). 

My advice is to take a break and check him into a hospital if you can, in fear for his and yourself's safety. On the break, think, think about your relationship, and think about who he really is and if he deserves to be with you in his current state. 

I'm not a doctor, so I can't exactly say if he's depressed or has a PD or nothing, I just don't exactly know for sure. 

Also, you're definitely not too "old" to have kids, that's silly, 28 yrs old is a decade and a half away from being too "old". Also, fat at 165? That's just simply bullying, and false. 

Anyway, I hope you get through this, life is hard and it's even harder when someone is somewhat weighing you down... As hard as that is to hear.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seroquel is pretty sedating, and by pretty, I mean really, really sedating until you build a good enough tolerance (which is also hard for me because I come off my meds). I am not Bipolar though, just schizophrenic. For some people it doesn't work (or it's just so sedating that there is no point in taking it). 

It takes away the good feelings for anyone I believe because it basically blocks dopamine (among other things). 

The sedation may go away (it does for me if I take it for long enough) or it may not... Will it work? Maybe, or maybe not (if you've been taking it longer than 2.5 weeks and it still hasn't made you feel better, then change the med. 

I would ask your doc for depakote or lithium, and try that with another anti psychotic (abilify might work for you).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So here's the thing, I know that the game is supposed to be "emotional" or whatever, but I just don't see it. This game (whether I am watching someone play it or I am playing it myself) doesn't affect me. Is it meant to? I don't feel sad, or anything when someone dies, or when I read something that's supposed to be sad, etc... So my question is, is this game meant to be emotional and is it meant to affect me in any way?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I started taking opiates for persistent headaches that I still get when I come off of them (even when I'm past the withdrawal), but when I'm on them I get no headaches whatsoever. These headaches were sometimes extremely debilitating and have made me wake up in pain and throw up, other times they're just a 2-4 on the pain scale but can go up to an easy 7-8. I've never had them really checked out, but I did have an MRI and Lumbar Puncture a few months ago and nothing came up, so obviously it's not a tumour or anything... I've not told doctors about my headaches so I've never had them diagnosed, but I came to the suspicion that they're cluster headaches.

*I take opiates for the high as well, but I legitimately need them for pain.*

Now I have a pain in my tailbone area that's been going on for about 3 weeks I would say, I had it checked out last week and the doctor just gave me some shitty Naproxen (which didn't even touch the pain at all) it's EXTREMELY uncomfortable to sit down and about 7-10 when getting up from the seat. Anyway, that's why I take opiates aswell as chasing that high.

What's your story? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Being addicted to a drug isn't fun. Having to NEED a substance in your body as if it's food or water is soul crushing. It could take you years and years and years until the addiction finally ruins you and everything around you is gone, and then, you'll probably get help but because the substance had/has such a massive grip on you, what's stopping you going back when things get a little tough? Nothing, unless you have something or someone that keeps you going.

When you're addicted to something (Opiates for me) even if it's ruined everything in your life and you finally get help, you can still (and probably will) relapse a few times into that same thing, that destroyed you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's mushrooms and various research chemicals, but that's about it when it comes to psychedelics IME. Meth is extremely neurotoxic same with Cocaine, Dexedrine and Adderall, Ritalin etc. They literally damage your brain, but not only that, they damage the shit out of your heart if you do it long enough. While opiates, don't damage organs at all, the biggest risk from using an opiate is severe repository depression and stopping breathing. 

It's extremely easy to get E here too, but I've just not been involved in that scene in particular yet. I've never tried nitrous but I'm sure it'll cross my path, either medically or just recreationally. DMT is something I wanna try but it's not easy to get here I don't think, the easiest psychedelic to get is shrooms. 

The drugs I have most exp. with are Opiates and Stimulants. The funny thing is, the Amphetamine I've done was from the street, Amphetamine Paste (Oral). The few times I've got it though it's never really hit me as hard as say, Ritalin, for some reason, but Ritalin is said to be the pharmaceutical cocaine.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It comes from Afghanistan (the street stuff), but I've heard lately that we grow our own poppy plants for our pharmaceutical stuff, especially the pharma diamorphine. Morphine and Codeine is probably what I will stick with forever because my tolerance never seems to go too high, even after a year and a bit of pretty much non stop abuse. It probably did boost tourism in Glasgow, but it's funny because the movie and book are set in Edinburgh.  

The DHC here the 30mg (per pill) is basically our hydrocodone, and some people say it's better than hydro, and I use that sometimes because it just lasts a lot longer, and feels kinda like dihydromorphine. 


The weirdest thing about my drug history is that I started off abusing stimulants, especially high doses of snorted Ritalin (which will most likely fry your brain if you binge on that stuff for more than a week), and Amphetamine a few times, then basically I saw some codeine 30mg (per pill) and started off abusing Morphine and other kinds of opiates from there. 

Btw, I've only tried Tamazepam 20mg (for sleep during WD), Valium and some Librium I found that was quite old. What's the Valium like for you on a recreational point of view? They never seemed to do much for me.

<TEXT> I love trainspotting, you can't be Scottish and not have watched/read trainspotting. Also, I can read Scots, I'm from Scotland lol. Yeah, I read it just there because you posted it on this thread, everything said in trainspotting is spot on about heroin, and it really shows the problem with heroin in Scotland. I can literally go down to the local store which is 2-5 mins away walking and see at least 1 to 5 heroin addicts, it's stupidly easy to get heroin here. 

This is my favourite "quote" from the movie: "People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored. But what they forget is the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get pissed. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking wins, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had undiagnosed chronic pain, especially really bad headaches (which was the thing I had the longest) which basically felt like my brain exploding  but nothing showed on an MRI or Spinal Tap, and recently I've been having really bad pain in my lower back, tailbone and legs. I had nothing prescribed and didn't even know what an opiate really was back then, so I saw some tramadol and codeine 30s in my cabinet and took some and it made me feel good while taking away all pain. I've not had a headache while on opiates but when off them, it's extremely painful and nothing else solves them. 

Pain sucks bro, especially persistent pain and some doctors won't even prescribe chronic opiates for longer than a few years, when someone might need them for basically ever. 

I've always heard opiate addicts quit for 15-20-30 years and still relapsing and sometimes dying even, opiates have a weird, sometimes life long grip on someone, especially someone with pain. 

Why don't you get a suboxone doc or whatever once you want to quit? 

tl;dr: I started using for pain and recreation at the same time basically.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whatever I can get my hands on really, usually 210-240mg codeine a day and/or 30-100 mg of morphine (depending on ROA), and sometimes 180-210 mg of DHC, which is said to be equivalent to hydrocodone if not better.

A 500mg a day of oxy would've fucked me so hard.

I've only been an "addict" for a year and a few months. You? (If you don't mind answering how long you've been taking opiates). 

Edit: I believe I'm an extensive metaboliser of codeine basically. Living in Scotland, I could easily go and get heroin in about 5 mins, thank god I haven't done that... Yet.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They are, but the black market for the Rx opiates aren't here and some drugs don't get prescribed (eg. hydrocodone) but others do like, Oxy, DHC, Diamorphine (in some cases). But the black market for the Rx's don't really exist apart from benzos.

<TEXT> Oxymorphone is a lot stronger than oxycodone because it's the straight drug in your system, 15mg of oxycodone isn't 15mg of oxymorphone, it's just that one of the metabolites of oxycodone is oxymorphone, you follow me? Btw, oxycodone isn't a "pro drug" it just has oxymorphone metabolites. 

I live in the UK and have never heard of anyone being prescribe oxyMORPHONE but oxycodone is quite common for chronic pain. Does Australia not use diamorphine (in a hospital setting or on prescription for terminally ill, usually cancer, patients) like here in the UK? Because I thought I heard someone that you guys do use it, but I'm probably extremely mistaken.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No problem. 

I've always liked codeine and morphine better than almost any other opiate. People always hate on codeine because they "don't feel anything" but there's multiple factors into why you wouldn't feel much and one of the main reasons is the lack of the (or lowered function) enzyme needed to make CodeineMorphine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Codeine is a pro drug, so basically in order for it to work it needs to be converted/metabolised in the liver by an enzyme called CYP2D6, some people either lack this COMPLETELY or the function of it is basically nil, therefore they can't convert it into morphine as much or at all.

<TEXT> IVing things, if done correctly with good techniques, can be really safe (of course not as safe as taking a pill, snorting normally or any other method that doesn't require much technique). Keep in mind also that heroin addicts for example pretty much need to move on to IV because once your tolerance gets stupidly high, smoking, snorting or whatever just doesn't cut it any more and it gets insanely pricey. IVing heroin is cheaper because you need less.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was just wondering what your thoughts on stimulants were? I know that for me when I have some extra money I will buy any real stimulant I can get, usually Methylphenidate and Amphetamine (Rarely). I usually do this 1-3 times a year, but from my recent usage of stimulants I have realized that I don't really like them that much, but I use them because I used to really, really love stimulants. It's kind of a weird relationship with them.

Anyway, what are your thoughts on stimulants? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why the heck would they put someone with psychosis on anti depressants, especially Bupropion. They should've started you off with an anti psychotic first, that's what usually SHOULD happen. 

How long do you have to wait for? (I live the UK so I don't really understand health insurances). 

Edit: If you were depressed before, then you should've been put on an anti depressant AND an anti psychotic, but it's still kinda weird putting someone with Drug Induced Psychosis on anti depressants, especially if it wasn't caused by the depression (Psychotic depression).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think your doc is correct, you are definitely paranoid for sure, so the drug induced psychosis thing is definitely a good Dx. I have schizophrenia, so I know what it's like, albeit a little different but when I'm in a psychotic break, its essentially all the same. Are you taking any medications for this psychosis? 

MDMA and Coke can both cause psychosis if abused the way you abused them, and acid also can I believe, but more commonly it's usually HPPD with acid but psychosis can definitely happen with the use of acid as well. So basically, you abused 3 drugs that can cause psychosis... Hopefully you're taking some meds, or therapy at least, but psychosis usually can't be solved by just therapy itself.

Stay safe.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can tell you this with experience, a lot of the time when someone gets a prescription for oxy, sooner or later, they will do something illegal with it (snorting, injecting, or just taking it for a buzz and no longer for pain). Criminalizing anyone for drug abuse/use when they are otherwise a loving parent is just, insane. Also, I think you CAN do something about it, YOU can also fight back at the heart of it.

And it would be nice to become a foster parent when I'm a little older.

<TEXT> It's not just bad that they're spewing misinformation (of course that's bad) but it's when people basically say that you can't have schizophrenia because you can type or make somewhat coherent sentences, because we already have a hard time believing that we're ill in the first place. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Rant about how people see schizophrenia on the wide internet </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-17 17:05:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So in my experience I have encountered a lot of people that just don't believe schizophrenics are on the Internet. It's gotten to the point that in online society that if you even ADMIT you have schizophrenia, everyone laughs, why is this? It's as if that if you have schizophrenia or even bipolar (to a lesser extent maybe) that you can't come online, it's just simply impossible to these people.

Does the wider Internet still believe that schizophrenics pretty much just sit in a corner and cry or babble insanity as if we are insane? Do they not realise that we are just normal people that can come online and share experiences? I don't get it. 

I've even seen people that are allegedly in a psychosis come on reddit and type their thoughts, of course when I'm in a severe psychosis I don't say anything online about it and sometimes end up in hospital or... Worse, but I'm not in a CONSTANT severe psychosis that some people seem to think. 

So basically what I'm annoyed at is, on the wider Internet if you even ADMIT you're schizophrenic, you're deemed a fake and a "dumbass". Its really put me down because now, I don't know if what I experience is real. Maybe I am just a dumbass. Who knows. 

Please share you're thoughts, this was just a rant.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> But what I'm telling you is just what I've gathered from a lot of health professionals (neurologists and stuff also) and about a year and a bit of opiate use. 

So schizophrenia wasn't really caused by anything for me, it's just stuff I've gathered from health pros :). 

And even they don't even fully understand the brain  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Scientifically though, opiate use no matter what stage USUALLY doesn't do anything long term, except maybe depression. Also opiates have Anti depressant, anti anxiety and anti psychotic properties (I have no idea why they have anti psych properties, I don't even think scientists know this because we don't know SHIT about the brain let alone schizophrenia. 

Opiates are actually one of the safest drugs (besides weed, heck even weed can bring schizophrenia out apparently). I know quite a lot about drugs especially opiates and alcohol since I was addicted to opiates and my parents are alcoholics.

<TEXT> Yes I have tried a few other meds, they either produced more symptoms or made me a zombie (but not sedated just emotion wise). They're working a little I guess, they've made me more insightful but the symptoms clear up then come back for longer than they've cleared up, it pretty much feels like the meds are trolling me.

I don't feel like being medicated forever, I'm just a little sad with having a mental illness I guess. Thank you for your input. 

Also, it's just my positive symptoms that somewhat get better, negatives never have.  </TEXT>

I think meds are just a false hope... no point in them now. Love you guys :* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey. So I've had moderate episodic depression for a while now along with schizophrenia and I just feel like it never gets better, the loneliness, the sadness, emptiness etc. sometimes when I come out of it I think that I will never go back into it, only to find my self depressed again. It's like it gives me hope when it goes away, and then takes all that hope away when it comes back.

Meh, I must just be a pussy. But does it ever get fully better? Ever?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not irritated at all by self diagnoses, as long as you're very educated on mental health, as you said you were.

People in my family knew I was schizophrenic before any doc diagnosed me, so self diagnoses or semi self diagnoses or family diagnoses (in my case) can be helpful to the person and the doctor that will later diagnose you, well, in my case that's how it went.

And all you can do is get out of the house and get a psychiatrist AND psychologist and if you need one, someone that's educated on mindfulness, or research that form of meditation yourself and try it out while you're "in the dark" so to speak when it comes to meds. :)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, so a story of my ex girlfriend... 

Well, every time I was in the midst of a delusion and acting weird and strange, and very out there and you know, "paranoid", she would get angry and say, "you can't POSSIBLY blame your disorder/illness for this", I found this very insensitive and out right stupid.

As the disease progressed I would stop seeing people, essentially isolating and not washing and having thought issues, like word salad, and again she would look at me weirdly, scoff and say, "you can't blame schizophrenia *scoff*"... Funny thing is I never blamed schizophrenia at all.

And this goes for hallucinations and my depressive episodes too.

Why is this? Please answer anyway you want, you don't have to be nice if you don't want to :).  </TEXT>
