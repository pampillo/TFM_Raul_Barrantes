<TEXT> I would definitely agree with you on that. I also wasn't ever horrified watching the movie. Like I said, I thought the movie created a sense of dread in me while I watched. The score was very original and added to the creepiness of the entire movie experience. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just saw this movie today and I can't shake the feeling of dread I got from it. The concept of the movie was very original and I thought the movie, for the most part, was well made. Most scary movies these days rely on the jump scares or go overboard with the gore, however It Follows relies on something different. The thought of someone or something continuously walking towards you with the gravest of intentions was certainly unnerving. Has anyone else gotten the chance to see it? What did you all think? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Kindred spirits man! The Simpsons game was definitely our other top favorite. I can't even imagine how many quarters we spent playing our way through those two games.

Edit: I just checked and apparently Apple went down over 3 points today. Apparently beating all the forecasts and making $18 billion dollars in one quarter isn't enough for Wall Street. I know nothing about the stock market haha.

Edit 2: Texted my financial advisor and fellow redditors reporting, up 6% after close. Profit reported after the close of the market. Feeling good again! </TEXT>

1. What do you think the auto industry will look like in 10 years?

2. Will Tesla foray into the driverless automobile sector at some point in the future?

Thanks in advance and good luck tomorrow! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Couldn't agree more with this analysis. I honestly think that the players love playing for Harbaugh, but at this point they know they are playing for a coach that is going to be forced out after this season and it is completely toxic. Jed York and Baalke are going to run this ship into the ground and it's so sad to watch. I feel the worst for Frank Gore. That poor, poor man. He deserves better than this! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure who to believe on this post. However, you posted a well thought out, seemingly informative and reasonable post that seems to be from a level of experience. Most posts in Reddit claim to be from someone in that field, when you can sometimes tell the person is just trying to make something up to sound smart or for karma. You are the only post in here on the other side of things, but you don't have that armchair professional air to your rhetoric. I can appreciate that. Have an upvote. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was at a party in college drinking and having a good time when a few kids came over that were looking for some trouble. We were out on the front lawn asking their group to move onto the next party and stop causing trouble and they were getting more and more riled up. My buddy put his hand onto one of them to ask them to move down the block when another kid suckerpunched my friend and knocked him out. He immediately took off running, as we gave chase, and he started to run across the street. Right as my buddy grabbed the back of his shirt, the kid got plowed into by a car.

It was a grisly scene. The kid was hit so hard that he went through the car window. He was slumped over the steering wheel of the car and the driver was sitting there motionless with a look I will never forget. The kid's leg was backward and his bone was sticking out of his leg. He was unconscious for a while and we called the cops to send an ambulance as quickly as possible. He woke up after a while and started screaming in pain and trying to pull himself out of the windshield. He was cutting his hands up real bad and a few of us had to restrain him from hurting himself any further.

Several cops, ambulances, and firetrucks showed up and eventually he was removed from the windshield and taken to the hospital. The car was going 32 MPH according to the police after they measured the skid marks from the car's brakes. The dean of student affairs interviewed me a few times about what happened and told me that the kid had numerous broken bones including the compound fracture of his leg, internal bleeding, a major concussion and needed over 400 stitches. My buddy that grabbed his shirt had to get glass removed from his hand and needed several stitches. The good news is that the kid recovered and returned to school after a few months. I will never forget the whole experience, it was such an intense situation. In a flash of time, a kid's life could have ended, but he luckily was spared. We were obviously pissed at the kid for hitting my friend, but I would never wish that on anyone.

TL;DR: A kid suckerpunched my friend, ran into the street and got hit by a car and ended up halfway through a windshield of a car with terrible injuries.

<TEXT> On August 7th, 2007 I happened to be lucky enough to be offered to throw out the first pitch of a San Francisco Giants game, as part of Italian Heritage Night. My family booked the biggest block of group tickets and so the Giants ticket office gave us the opportunity to throw out the first pitch and my family chose me. Barry Bonds ended up breaking Hank Aaron's home run record that night when he hit his 756th home run. I ended up getting him to sign the baseball after the game. The ball has my name, the date and the Giants logo monogrammed on it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My cheeks get flushed and sweaty when I eat green apples. I never really noticed that this was unusual until I was wiping some perspiration off my cheeks and my girlfriend asked me why my face was so red. I told her about it and said that I thought this happened to everyone when they ate tart things. She laughed at me, called me weird and assured me that this was not normal. Am I dying? Is this a actual medical affliction? </TEXT>
