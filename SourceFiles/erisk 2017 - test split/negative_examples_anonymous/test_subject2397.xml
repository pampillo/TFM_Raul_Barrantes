<TEXT> So in the store you will notice TV's playing stupid commercials about products they carry. These have been around for awhile, but recently they installed newer monitors that have what appear to be webcams at the top of the screen. I'm assuming they're for facial recognition software, but I just though I'd let you all become aware of this latest installation.  </TEXT>

It's definitely different from the normal settup but it just shows how deep the show can get. Just Ted alone with his thoughts and I think we've all been there, and the speech of course.

<TEXT> This was really just a strange episode. I like the Robin Sparkles videos but to have a whole fake documentary on a character was kindof pushing it big time. It's awesome they got all those cameos but it also felt like a bit of a waste of their talent to say one line. Just more weird attributes to Robin's character

Also why would they ruin the whole Marshal Lily story like that? For the sole reason of justifying what Ted is doing by being a stalker? Had they seriously ran out of that many ideas at that point? Seemed totally unnecessary to make Ted feel better </TEXT>

Later Ted is explaining why Barney needs a win and Barney says "And firing half my department freed up the money to double my own salary.
And this chick from Boston was wicked hot in bed last night, and I'm getting more muscular, even though I've stopped working out, and I've got this amazing poker group."


It's not even a joke really but this is how HIMYM keeps you on your toes when you're watching.  There's stuff like this in just about every episode too </TEXT>

<TEXT> Easily one of the best episodes, not only because the acting is great but every character is engaged.  Ted wearing Tweed and becoming the sexless inkeeper and Barney's hilarious poem. Then Marshal with the gouda and Jason Segel's great singing video montage (meow). Then Barney and Robin being a "single" couple. "Just the 2 of you?" Lily getting upset with Marshal for springing the video and then getting in trouble for inviting the other couple for a weekend away too soon. And finally Ted'd own poem and Barney's look of regret at the end for being in a relationship " What have I done!" </TEXT>

<TEXT> Freshman year we actually managed to throw a decent party in someone's corner room (bigger than most dorms). All of a sudden an RA came in and there was alcohol everywhere. One dude there decided to go into the bathroom and punch the paper towel dispenser so hard he ended up busting up his hands and the police were called. Then this girl ended up puking on the floor of the corner room and the RA had her escorted to the hospital. It was basically chaos for a bit. I managed to walk out and despite them getting our student IDs down only the person who punched the dispenser got in trouble.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, I'm just going to ask this.
Do you really want to come back from this? - 

What's that supposed to mean? - 

Architecture is killing you, Ted, and it's killing us to watch it killing you.
You're like that goat with the washcloth.
You want it so bad, and every time the world tries to take it away from you, you keep grabbing it.
But you know what? It's just a washcloth.
Why do you even want it?

 Because I have to be an architect.
That's That's the plan.

Screw the plan.
I planned on being a famous artist.
Marshall planned on being an environmental lawyer.
Robin planned on being a TV reporter.

Found it </TEXT>

<TEXT> She basically tells Ted to quit as an architect and just give up on everything he's worked for, saying it's killing him and killing them watching it kill him. She also compared his career to the rag that the goat was eating saying "why do you even want it so badly". To me it just seemed so anti-himym advice.

I don't really like Ted's answer though saying "that's the plan". It's not just the plan to him it's what he loves doing and I wish he had said that instead </TEXT>

<TITLE> SP and sadness and happiness </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-02 01:42:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First off this might be long and I don't really expect anyone to read it...

Anyways, first time I read SP was a couple years ago or so and now I'm rereading them for about the 50th time.  And every time I read them I get this "feeling". And I think it's that I sort of relate to Scott in that I tend to elate things in my mind, and I'm also really clueless about girls emotions.  For example, Scott and Kim's relationship how she never stops caring about him. I know I've unintentionally led girls on in the past and I feel like a jerk about it. But by the end of SP we realize that everyone has done things in their past that were bad, or they regret, and it's a nice thought that you can move past that.

I also love the books because I (and I'm sure everyone) goes through the struggles of life (school etc.) and SP sortof has that simple carefree life and it reminds me to just not worry about things as much.

Anyways, those are just a couple reasons why the books are awesome. Maybe other people relate to the books in the same way, but either way thanks for readin </TEXT>

Barney's part too. He just becomes a total loser at the end. Perfect month? I'm sorry but no. And then he has a kid with a random ho whom we know nothing about and everything is fine and dandy.

<TEXT> Sorry you have had bad professors. 

I myself am a Senior here at WSU and have mostly taken classes in the Bio/chem departments. I have to say with the exception of my Engl 101 TA every professor I've had has been great. They are all experts in their fields, have been very good with explanations and keeping the class interested, and all their tests have been fair in accordance with the syllabus. Even the difficult classes I wouldn't complain about because they just require more studying.

If you are thinking of coming here, please do.  This is an awesome college with great programs (especially engineering).  Go Cougs! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not the biggest football expert but.. I'm afraid this is a little too true. I think momentum is important for us and Nevada is a school we should be able to beat. Of course if the WSU team that played Rutgers played Nevada I think we would've won. I do however think our home game schedule will be to our advantage since they're against some tough teams but home field advantage will be in our favor. Go Cougs! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've seen the show too many times so I tend to get seasons mixed up but I'd say for most the show Marshal is a corporate lawyer which according to the show/real life makes a lot of money. Plus Lily has a teacher's salary albeit not great but still. So why are they always seemingly broke? Even if Lily spent her entire paychecks on clothes I don't see how they'd be tight on money, and Marshal's school debt would be bad but I doubt he doesn't have a plan on it. Any thoughts? </TEXT>
