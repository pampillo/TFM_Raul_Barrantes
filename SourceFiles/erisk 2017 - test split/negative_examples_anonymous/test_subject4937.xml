<TEXT> This is not the point, nor is it the case.

There's a reason why they wanted the Xeon Phi. Because for supercomputing applications, it's either that or the (also U.S-dev'd) GPU accelerators. 

The actual point is that the U.S. just hastened the development of competitive chips (lower price, power, etc). This was probably happening already, but it was a firm kick in the ass to start kicking ass.

The people that design the policies and trade restrictions do so in a technological vacuum. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So much CFD is done on workstations. But for building clusters turned for ANSYS and other applications, sometimes it helps to attend training sessions at user conferences. I know ANSYS has them, in fact, most do. Other integrators do training sessions for end users but would be happy to host someone looking to learn. And the universities with HPC centers would prob be willing to chat hardware with you. Always read stuff too, there's not a lot of HPC specific stuff that isn't PR from HPCwire, which used to be great before they lost their good writers, but Beowulf boards (Beowulf.org) is great for specific questions  </TEXT>

That was his only reason. She was just silent a minute like "ummm" ....then it got stranger. I don't know if she just had him on for the sake of amusement (all of the Wire podcasts are with reputable people this is an anomaly) or what but I am mystified by almost everything he said. He doesn't sound like someone who understands a single thing about HPC. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is a certain sense I get among the supercomputing elite that Hadoop is technology for Web 2.0 companies, that's there's no relevance. It's an unwillingness to experiment. That seems unfortunate because most of their workloads look a lot more like big data analytics (they would cringe to hear that) than they do strict floating point stuff. SDSC is the only real center where development work on this is actually translating into real applications being run...and guess what, they're running more efficiently. </TEXT>

At some point, they're going to have to move to greener pastures (literally)... not sure how this issue isn't at the forefront of people's minds--don't even see anything about it in the disaster recovery space much. Yet meanwhile, look at the situation the whole West Coast was in... not to be dramatic about it, but this is a growing concern. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The only ones that are "easy" to polish by hand are softer sedimentary rocks. You'll have quite a bit of trouble with the obsidian by hand, even with the toughest of all sandpaper. Actually, one of things that has made polishing more fun on the ones I do by hand is using diamond files. They sound expensive--it's just synthetic grit with a handle. Much quicker and more fine-tuned than sandpaper or a sanding sponge. I have many crinoid and coral fossil specimens in a softer matrix and they clean off very well with diamond files. I cleaned matrix from a garnet (garnet schist) with the diamond files well too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Intel has been clear though, to their great credit, that onboarding is easier than with GPUs. Still, actual users of the first-gen Phi say that optimization is still a very long process--sometimes in the end just as long as porting code to run on GPUs. The upside is that when they do that they by default get better performance on their regular Xeons.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> NVIDIA is afraid...in this space (at this point for this particular type of large-scale systems that MIC was drawn for). They owned the concept of accelerated large-scale compute but the addition of on-package memory, the ability to swap between coprocessor/plain Xeon is the only thing like it, and they have the x86/programming ecosystem. CUDA, OpenCL are great--NVIDIA GPUs offer way higher performance, but the ease is the real crux here.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Xeon Phi has only ever been a coprocessor, the point here is that it's the first processor ever to do both at the same time. It can do both--and on top of that, be programmed roughly the same way. GPUs or other accelerators require offloading and serious code hassle. When Landing hits the ground there's no more of that--and it all leverages common x86 binaries, etc. -- The 512 aspect is a minor point. A MAJOR point is also that this thing has memory on package--another first. People don't realize what a game changer this is--for users and Intel alike. Right now it's just important for highly parallel applications in HPC--in 5 years, this will be the new face of Xeon. A serious rival to other contending architectures (ARM +GPU, for instance). </TEXT>

<TEXT> North Carolina is known for its precious stones. Emeralds in particular. Also an abundance (relatively, of course) of garnet (almandine for the most part); Hiddenite (only found here); ruby/sapphire (lots but not a lot gem quality). My favorite finds in NC are amazing quartzes, some of which are clear as glass and as large as my hand. Most of these found in Western NC.  </TEXT>

The question is, would they want them from IBM when, as mentioned in the article, HP, Supermicro, Dell and others are going to stick it on the price (not to mention the flexibility--i.e. for now it's just Xeon E5) -- It's hard to see IBM competing in the "made in China" wars but this does seem to be where the server market itself is going--Open Compute-inspired, stripped down systems that are purpose-driven and free from the cumbersome crap (like Platform's workload mgr, etc--things included here)...

<TEXT> Well, hello neighbor--I am in High Point. Found these in one giant patch of similar thick rocks with ripples and brought many of them home. They were in a MOST geologically strange location--crystals unlike I've seen a couple of (seriously) amethyst points. Never seen anything like it. 

These are not stromatolites for sure. Got a bunch of those already--these things are thick, like layers and layers of ancient mud. I will take a few photos in a little bit to give you a sense of what some of the others are with my tiny, tiny hands as scale (ha--seriously).

Love the Pteridinium but this thing would have to be many yards long and there's not enough regularity.

Pics coming in 10 minutes or so of some of my other hunks. Again--weird locale. Amethyst points (2), an emerald, and what appears to be citrine. Not sure what to think. 

Okay--off to photograph for you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks so much for taking the time and thought to send the link and ideas. I have a number of other pieces of this "fossilized mud" stuff that look somewhat similar to the pieces there, but they are VERY thick. Some of the pieces are 6-8 inches thick, others thicker. It looks like this (which I found after a long search for anything similar) http://getoffourplanet.com/?p=3603

The weird thing is, the "bones" in this are black and much harder than the surrounding rock. It is possible for me to clean around it and those remain. Afraid to do so until I know more.

To answer your question, there is no curvature to any of the chunks I have--the link above is almost exactly what this stuff looks like. Oddly enough, there isn't anything clearly visible that's fossilized in anything other than the deep ripples (which incidentally, when a big one broke, the ripples go all the way through--completely 3D).

I am so glad you sent that info. It helps me keep an eye for other exciting things in the vicinity!

<TEXT> I found a number of pieces of fossilized, dark mud in a riverbed in central north carolina. Surrounded by some of the most perfectly formed quartz points I've seen around here, to boot. Strange place... Most of the fossilized mud pieces are straight or slightly wavy lines. Light sanding tones them down. But under these "toes" or whatever they are it's black hard rock, different than what makes these up. Can anyone help me ID? I am new to this... </TEXT>

The editors secured a special draft report directly from Oak Ridge National Laboratory and are expected to share full details about peak performance numbers (as confirmed) as well as full specs for benchmarks, application range, processor to coprocessor ratio, memory subsystem and ooo...the interconnect topology. Exciting stuff for the supercomputing world. They note they'll post this around 11 p.m. Eastern or midnight. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe, but maybe not. There's the Moore's Law issue I cited a moment ago, and the cost of powering a system like this expected to increase. It's not feasible for anyone to own one of these unless you're a research institution (like DOE Nat'l lab--not hospitals). It was a cunning play from IBM to show the applicability of HPC technologies in everyday settings but it's far from practical. Unfortunately too--imagine what would be possible with a HAL treating us! ;) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am curious about what made you guys choose InfoSphere Streams over vanilla Hadoop (complexity, learning curve, functionality) when from what I can tell this is the same core Hadoop framwork (down to the HDFS)... Just when you get time, know you're looking for an answer but I'm just curious.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that Watson's role as an instant "second opinion" from a "doctor" is going to bode well for medicine in general. The issue is that only the most advanced research hospitals (who already have the most outstanding researchers/medical pros) will be able to afford a system like this. Right now the IBM System Z line is more than many universities can afford--getting it into actual hospitals is going to require some hurdling over Moore's law--if you can afford the hardware, the power and cooling for this puppy will kill you. Could be many thousands to run this each month. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Perhaps Iceland should understand this issue and offer a more attractive option to conduct business there on site but as it is, it's pretty expensive to do anything. And besides, not sure anyone (even the most hermit-inclined sys admin) wouldn't be willing to move there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great quote... "data science is a very fuzzy term, but what seems to unite a lot of people is that is theyve come from a lot of different directions and ended up in the same place. It almost feels like this crossroads where a lot of different disciplines actually meet and share and exchange tools and techniques and talk and collaborate." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mortar actually seems like a pretty interesting service. Hadoop as a service itself is going to be the next wave of services in general--all enabled by AWS (because who really uses any other cloud), I just wonder how the message about such companies is going to resonate with actual users. It's hard to wrap a "sell" around that, especially for those who've already dumped a lot of money/time into teaching a team Hadoop or getting hooked in with a distro vendor. </TEXT>
