<TITLE> Question about The Hunt [Jagten] - 2012 (Major spoilers inside) </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Just finished watching The Hunt, and while I thought it was a fantastic film, I need to know, who the fuck shot at Loucas? Are we to assume what happened to him will follow him indefinitely? Or am I a blundering idiot who missed a giant part of the plot somehow?

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I am a creature living in the sewers of the audiophile world. I am a father of two small children, so therefore my budget is fairly limited. Today my Onkyo TX-NR609 amplifier ceased to exist. It was nothing fancy, but it did the trick. I would game/movie watch/listen to tunes through it VIA xbox/xbox 360/xbox one/PS3 (media server). So all I would like to know, is what would be a decent replacement for the amplifier? This is assuming my speakers/sub are still operational. I'd like to stay around $500.00 CAD. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a dream the other night where I was back in a department store in my home town where my mom would take me shopping for back to school clothing. The place was so dimly lit and eerie. As I was walking through I felt like I wasn't me, and I somehow hijacked someone else's body as I roamed around. I ended up bumping into 9 year old me trying on baseball hats in the mirror and it freaked me out. I like to believe that I had time travelled in my sleep, and that frightens me.

<TEXT> Thanks for the input. This is my first time really messing around with audacity and/or recording anything at all really. But I think you're right, that as long as it's listenable we shouldn't worry about quality too much. Also, I'm not aiming for professional studio quality, I just want everyone's levels to be somewhat similar. When I listen to it driving I noticed the internet streamed voices were a bit of an ear assault. 

I'm scared of the effects menus, they're scary and it makes me frightened. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As some of you may know, /u/Jafvalla and I are conducting an interview themed podcast of sorts. We are beginners, busting our way through an age old established formula. As anyone could have guessed, we are running into a few production/quality issues.

I've managed to figure out how to record a stereo mix of the audio through google hangouts, however with that, everyone's sound quality suffers slightly. 

If anyone with audio/recording experience could give suggestions, we would be greatly appreciative. My questions are as follows:

 * How can one record their own voice in addition to a stereo mix of what's coming from the internet? (When I attempt to open two audacity windows and alter "stereo mix" to my microphone, it automatically switches to the same recording settings in the second window).

 *  If all parties involved record their own voices, how does one match them up simultaneously/ seamlessly? Is some sort of queue required at the beginning like a [clapperboard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clapperboard)? That to me seems to be the only way, but I have no idea what I'm talking about.

 * If a stereo mix of audio is recorded from my station, where my voice will be crystal clear, and others may sound "tinny" or louder than mine, what is the best way to equalize the audio?

<TEXT> I went back to my home town where I met some old friends at a pub on a week night, it was absolutely deserted. We had control over the jukebox the entire time so it was awesome. Anyway, the first song I put on was leathers, and the girl behind the bar mistook the silence at the beginning as a volume issue and cranked the speakers to the fucking max. All of us, including myself almost had heart attacks together. What a laugh. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Woah, thank you. I feel I am a pretty driven person, and that hard work is always worth the effort. Although, as I've mentioned I plan on utilizing these skills more towards photography, and not so much as a designer. I aim to be a well rounded person, and feel the skills learned with this would go a long way with what I want to achieve.

As for the "industry hacks" you've mentioned, I believe they exist in every trade, lord knows they did/do in my current industry (aircraft repair). I still managed to push through and maintain a valuable career all the same. But as it's a dying industry, and the thought of losing my job is taxing on my mind, I feel it's time to make change. There's no better time than now, as they say. Thanks again for your input. </TEXT>

Having said that, I will definitely take you seriously and will attempt to put something together. I should mention, I currently use a Rebel XSI, something I purchased in 2008, the camera that really sparked by attention. I am currently in the market for the Mark III, but am weighing my options against the Nikon 810A, I may wait it out for the new Canon line and focus on my education. Until then however, I feel I would be better represented by more experience with better equipment. Let me know what you think, and thanks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you very much for your insight and kind words. I wouldn't deny the fact that abnormal myelination could be a hard thing to see outside a trained eye. Maybe I've watched too many episodes of house, and have always pictured a diagnosis like this to be broken down in a very basic visual presentation. I just want to see it for myself, and have explained to me what I'm seeing. I'd love nothing more than to compare my son's MRI with a "healthy" one.

We already have an appointment with another neurologist, and as he's a colleague of our current doctor I'm hoping for an unbiased assessment. Only time will tell at this point. Thanks again. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-02-27 00:15:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Recently my wife and I have been told by a neurologist our son (2.5years old) may have a condition known as [pelizaeus merzbacher disease](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PelizaeusMerzbacher_disease). Based on his early development of nystagmus, current state of ataxia, and apparent low myelin formation on his MRI. As you can imagine we are taken back by this, especially while we wait for confirmation through genetic testing.

I've asked the doctor to please show us his MRI, and she has avoided this for almost two months now. Everytime I bring it up it seems she avoids it, explaining it would be of no use to us as "it's incredibly hard to spot". No matter how much I insist, we never get a chance to examine our son's MRI. So my question is this, how hard is it to actually see low myelin formation? Should I be concerned with how the neurologist is handling this? We are very scared, and it seems no one has any answers. I should mention I do not have a background in medicin, just an average blue collar worker.

Thank you very much.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This reminds me of a talent show my friends entered as a band back in high school. Of course the school wanted to review what each group would perform, so once they read the lyrics to "killing in the name of", they told the singer of the band he had to change "fuck you, I won't do what you tell me" or don't play it at all. Fast forward to the performance, he actually had the vagina to scream "screw you, I won't do what you tell me."

I feel he totally missed the point of the song.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've recently switched from iTunes to foobar200. I love the interface and the customizability so far.

I am having an issue with organizing my library. Turns out some albums in my music folder do not have the track number in the file name, but only in the tag. As such, those albums are now organized alphabetically in my foobar library. I have done some research, and have found I should sort by "%album% %tracknumber%" with no luck.

I'd really like to avoid having to update any album that doesn't have the track number in the song file names. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Sorry if this is redundant or the wrong sub, first post here. </TEXT>

I still buy CDs, and this software is the best I've come across. I'm sure one could acquire it for free, but I support them because it's so great. Not only rips CDs in FLAC/320, but fills out all identification tags and adds album artwork. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's the health epidemic that's sweeping the nation. If you and your product cannot be synonymous with healthy active living, it will fail in today's market. 

I'm not saying there's anything at all wrong with healthy living, but I can't help but feel it's forced down my throat every day, and this picture is a perfect example of it.

Every time I eat a cheeseburger or have a cigarette I can't help but feel overwhelmingly guilty, it really sucks.

<TEXT> I'm not sure they have a website, it's really just a butcher on a farm North of the city. They offer just about anything you can think of. They have all sorts of game meat (elk, bison, deer etc), and of course chicken, pig, and beef. A big juicy New York Striploin is about 10 dollars, and personally for me, the best thing I've ever eaten. 

I stock up on all my meats there, hamburger, whole chickens, bone-in hams, steaks, bacon, and sausages to name a few. It's worth seeking out and having a look for yourself.

(FYI - you have to call in and pre-order bone-in hams this time of year)

<TEXT> "Hey here's an amazing idea, would you like to buy it?"

"Holy fuck that's amazing, I would buy that in a heart beat"

"Ok we'll release it in like, 6 months"

"Alright 6 months has passed here you go!"

"This is nowhere near what you described 6 months ago."

"Oh yeah, well about that, we totally shouldn't have promised 6 months, more like 8. Sooooo sorry."

"As a consumer I should be outright pissed off and demand my money back. But because this is the current state of the world and it's lack of quality assurance, I'm totally ok with it." </TEXT>

After that I would say (in no particular order):

The Shining

Exorcist III

Martyrs

Jacob's Ladder

Silence Of The Lambs

<TEXT> CTF narrative from last night:

Red team up by one, I was playing defence with sniper. Team was having a hard time, abandoned post. Go hard after their flag, get it out of base, ours gets taken, I die, spawn, kill their carrier, return flag, team mates cap ours. 1-1, 4 minutes left, red team flogging us hard, I play defence with carbine on flag. Kill lots of them, they back off for a little bit, I jump on the mongoose and fly into their base, die immediately, repeat that 3 more times, 4th time in base, had enough back up to get the flag just outside of the door. Red plays major defence, everyone on our team continuously dies to touch the flag, catch a break and get it past the half way point. Clock is at 30 seconds left of overtime. Entire red team killing our carriers, not even 10 seconds left we get it in our base during a repetitive massacre. Every single one of us marched into the gun fire to pull that flag closer. 2-1 win for us.

First time I laid my controller down and exclaimed happiness aloud since halo 3. It almost seemed like everyone was playing to win for once. Something I rarely ever experience in halo 4. So much fucking fun. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember the controversy that surrounded the band in the media due to their electronic style shift, I was very intrigued. 

I received the album from my brother as a gift on my 18th birthday. The night I got it in the mail I had plans to hike to my friends cabin, as we usually did with whatever free time we had. I didn't go anywhere without my discman and a few albums. Of course I brought this one along with me and played it on a continuous loop for the entire trip. It was how our hikes usually were, especially during the cold winter nights when there wasn't much point in talking over the wind, better off keeping your head down and conserving energy.

This story is becoming more of a nostalgia trip for me than anything else, I apologize. Anyways, I'll never forget the moment we got off the main road and headed into the thick bush during the pitch black of the night, and snow falling like crazy. I fire up track one, everything in its right place, and it ended up being one of the most memorable music moments I have, and it sticks with me more than any concert I have ever been to. I instantly fell in love with Kid A, and listened to it on repeat for weeks, if not months. 

I'm not sure if it was the pitch black forest, trudging through powdered snow that was still falling through the beam of my flashlight that made the moment so goddamn perfect for that album, or if it was the album that made that moment so goddamn perfect. Whatever it was, it is and probably always will be my favorite Radiohead album.

Good times.

EDIT: I don't think this qualifies me as "old", but I remember it clearly so I thought I'd chime in. Or maybe that's me denying the fact I'm quickly getting old. </TEXT>

It's funny because back in 2003/04 which ever it was, I was browsing a local record store for new music (didn't have a computer or internet at the time), and the cover for Leviathan jumped out at me from across the store. Best impulse buy ever. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would, but if I parked there overnight I can almost guarantee that I would end up getting a ticket and/or towed. Seems like the parking authority only allows assholes to pull this kind of crap, as long as it's consistent. I like the passive aggressive note under the windshield, or maybe even a chalk outline marking "asshole parking". 

EDIT: I forgot I had this, perhaps I should print a couple. [http://i.imgur.com/irOp243.png](http://i.imgur.com/irOp243.png) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've brought it up with the board, and they will "look into it". Another issue I have with this is, this is our shared visitors lot with "NO OVERNIGHT PARKING". Not sure if you can see it on the sign or not but yeah. The absolute gull of some people. The only time it really becomes an inconvenience is the weekends when parking is scarce, so I try my hardest to look the other way throughout the week, but find it really hard as I pass by him everyday. Thanks for the idea.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Newbie to the audiophile world. Looking to invest in a turntable setup, and was wondering if my current [Onkyo TX-NR609](http://www.eu.onkyo.com/en/products/tx-nr609-35517.html) receiver would be sufficient. Not only am I very happy with its sound (I play 320 kbps MP3's through a PS3) but I am restricted for space in my man cave, investing in a separate receiver would be a challenge. 

What would be a decent beginner turntable setup, and how could I operate it through my current receiver? I'd like to keep my budget around the $500 CAD mark, but as always, am willing to weigh my options.

Thanks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really liked the live suggestion made by /u/sowr in my original post. The idea that their performance art currently best represents the band really stuck with me. It's a theme of its own when you think about it, a theme which is most relevant. 

Again I will reiterate that I am no photoshop expert, and there are probably many around here better suited for the task.
I would just really like to see a change from what we currently have.

EDIT: TL;DR The live tool experience best represents the band in my opinion. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Toddler separation anxiety. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-05 01:51:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My oldest son is almost 22 months, and for the past little while I cannot leave his presence (use the washroom, make/take a phone call, run errands etc etc.) without him throwing an absolute nightmarish tantrum. Up until now I've more or less shrugged it off, but I've got to thinking that *maybe* it's some form of separation anxiety. Now I'm wondering if this is normal and maybe just a phase kids go through. Just wondering if any of you have advice. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Original Pressing of Aenima on Vinyl </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-04-10 20:07:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Since there seems to be an almost zero chance of finding the original pressing of Aenima on vinyl, would any of you lucky owners be willing to rip and share yours? I've heard so many good things about the recording, and it being my favorite album of all time, I'm dying to hear it. Not sure if it would be near the same quality, but I'm willing to try anything at this point.

EDIT: I should go on *record* here and say that I am not a fan of "pirating" music, and that I buy all the music I enjoy listening to, that this plea is nothing but a desperate man trying to fulfill his curiosity. I'd love nothing more than to take a trip back to 1996 this weekend and buy my own copy for a price that wouldn't take food from my children's mouths. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I listen to all sorts of music, mostly metal. Of course I don't like to play dreary stuff around my son who is just hitting the 20 month mark here, so my other acquired tastes have come in handy. Not that they have a positive message per se, but it's all about being instrumental, upbeat, and light (electronica is good for this). The little guy loves to dance and bob his head around. Anyways, try a few of these maybe.

<TEXT> I did an Aircraft Structural Repair course through a Transport Canada approved school, I then applied all across the country to find a position. Once my foot was in the door I gained more and more experience until I completed the required task list in a logbook, then I wrote an exam to acquire my AME 'S' license. Everything I do involves reading and understanding engineering approved repairs and OEM drawings. Engineers do not over see the project at hand, but are there as support if there is a deviation from drawing spec. As a licensed tech I would never put my name to anything that wasn't to drawing spec, or deviated without engineering approval.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Without getting into too much detail, we would remove and replace the upper and lower outboard wing panels, beef up the outboard wing ribs, and add reinforcements to the wing stringers both in the wings and the centre tanks. Of course last but not least, hang the winglets.

EDIT: Eventually the 737's came from the factory with all the added rework complete, so that if a customer wanted to hang winglets, all they had to do was purchase and hang them up.

EDIT: Stringers not stingers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Please take my opinion lightly, but I've read your post and all the comments in it. It seems to me most of you are taking it all way too seriously, who gives a fuck? You're not going to change how other people perceive or feel about it, so why even bother. I'm with you on the matter but it's pointless to bring it up. Some people like things in a way that you don't, good lord better point it out, that'll teach them. Singling out the downfalls of others is pretty sophomoric in itself, why not make a post expressing your "insight" in a more constructive way? Why not tell us how Tool's music has affected you, changed you, or got you through a hard time, effectively removing the spot light from the "idols"? As for the comment here literally over analyzing the shit out of the whole thing, I've never read a more desperate attempt at trying to have Maynard personally login and and agree. Jesus H Christ people, it's music, of course the contributing artists will get credit equal to the greatness of the art. It's the exact same reason why many humans throughout history have become house hold names. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Hello /r/Toyota, this is my first time reaching out to this community and I was wondering if any of you could provide me with some information regarding my 2012 Tacoma. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As of this past weekend I have found out that my 4x4 actuator has failed, and my truck would not disengage from H4. I did some quick googling and found that this may be a common problem on newer Toyota models, however I wanted to know if any of you had experience with this issue. My truck is still covered by warranty so for now I will be spared the financial and labor burdens. However, if this is common I would like to know more about what it does exactly, and how I could prevent it from happening again (if possible) and/or fix it myself. 

Thanks in advance for your time. 

*FYI: I am not a mechanic, but I am mechanically inclined and wish to learn more about my vehicle as I am required.* </TEXT>

The guy writes:

*"UPC code is 6 1422-31087-1 1 There's another number on the back: 72445-11087-1"*

Does that make sense? Because it doesn't seem to. It would appear to be two different pressings. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I personally don't mind flipping $100.00 on a big production act, I know it isn't cheap to haul all of their gear around, not to mention the show itself is totally worth it, but this has been taken to a new level of expensive.

Again, I could probably land some $100.00 tickets during the public sale, but nothing short of the first 30 rows would make my 35 hours of driving worth it.

I'm with you on the underground, Animals As Leaders are playing downtown here for 25 dollars, can't get much better than that. </TEXT>

* I took the picture with my phone because I wanted to quickly send it to my cousin and didn't want to go through the process on my phone.

* These are the "platinum" seats for Red Rocks using the "MYWAVE" Soundgarden fan club code.

* It is my personal opinion that no one is worth this much and that these are obviously reserved for the rich. (Unless of course there was some kind of meet and greet and/or sound check attendance which even then I wouldn't flip the bill)

* I can't see Trent agreeing to this after all he's stood up and said regarding corporations with hands in his pockets. What the actual fuck is going on here?

<TEXT> [Jacob's Ladder.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099871/)

EDIT: I should add this is one of my all time favourite movies, not just as a horror either. It's from 1990, but holds up really well IMO.

<TEXT> Not sure if this is the appropriate sub for this or not, but the one and only Bruce Campbell will be at this years comic con and I'm a huge evil dead fan. This was enough to spark my interest and get me really excited about attending this year. Now I should add that I've never attended one of these before so please forgive my noobishness. 

I'd really like to know what Bruce is like for those of you whom have met him, I am not really the nervous type but have a feeling he'll set me back a step. More importantly what's the etiquette for getting stuff signed? Can you bring more than one item if any at all? Or do they make you purchase while inside?

I think that about sums it up, it's going to be really cool to meet a guy like Bruce, even if it is only for a minute. Thanks in advance dreddit. Again sorry if wrong sub.

<TEXT> Dude, I've had a girl tell me this exact same thing, then even go as far as naming the baby girl after my Mother. I didn't think I could afford a paternity test at the time, and thought it wasn't worth it because you know, she named her after my mom and all. My brother who was much more established than I was at the time insisted on paying for the test, lo and behold the baby wasn't mine. I was surprised at first even though it was only a one night stand deal that turned into a few more times afterwards, but apparently this chick was going through a really bad break up and this was her way of coping, obviously not filling me in on the details.

Either way, I didn't mean to bore you with the details seeing how you are probably in a much different situation, but goddammit, that paternity test changed my life. Please do yourself the favor before doing anything else.

That was 11 years ago and I am currently happily married with an 18 month old boy, and a girl on the way. I'm really not sure if any of that would have come to fruition had I taken her word for it. Speaking of which, I should call my brother, what an awesome guy.

<TEXT> My son is about to turn 18 months next week and he still doesn't walk. He did however start the spider walk yesterday (feet flat on the floor, legs straight, and moving forward with his hands) so I'm hoping that's a good sign. I was having this same question/thought plague my mind the other day, and I keep asking myself if I am doing anything wrong. 

On that note, it sounds like your son is doing fine, the whole army crawling thing is just another variation of crawling I believe, I watched a niece of mine develop the same way and she turned out to be a very smart and sweet little girl (age 7 now). I remember thinking it was peculiar, but it was just another developmental step before she was up and running. Otherwise everything else sounds right on par. Enjoy it while you can, babies are so sweet, I will miss these days I just know it. </TEXT>

He is a really active child, we have a hard time keeping up with him, he has no interest in television and loves to drive his cars around on the floor and dance to music, I doubt it's an surplus of energy.

<TITLE> Preventing my 17 month old son from hitting, grabbing, and pulling hair. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-20 18:54:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello /r/parenting, I'm so glad I found you this past week. I can tell I have much to learn from you guys and I look forward to growing with you. Having said that, I am new to fatherhood with my 17 month old son, and his soon to be born baby sister. So far I am having a blast, with all the ups and downs, all I know is I wouldn't change it for the world and that this has been the best experience of my life so far.

The reason I come to you guys with this post is that currently my son has started to hit really hard, he has always had a thing for pulling my wife's hair, but now he's doing both to us. I really don't know how to react when he does this, should I be firm and tell him no? Or should we try not to draw any attention to it. So far I've been doing my best to make him understand that it hurts and that he shouldn't do it, but it's seemingly having no effect.

I'd really like to know how to deal with this especially before our little girl enters the situation and becomes another victim. Thank you so much for any help you can offer.  </TEXT>

The fact that they are both lack backwards compatibility really irks me all the same, Street Fighter Alpha 3 for the PS is one of my all time favorite games, so if my PS3 ever does bite the dust I don't know what I'll do.

EDIT: I called every future shop/wal mart/best buy/visions ect ect. in the city when I tried to purchase the Xbone and there was zero availability if that means anything. </TEXT>

Maybe on the surface it would appear that way, but there are many trades for one to get into. Even with only a high school diploma, you could definitely get your foot in the door as a pipe fitter and make a great living in a few years. Do you know people in either town or surrounding areas? That would be the biggest deciding factor for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good old Sook Yin, I used to have a huge crush on her growing up. I seriously miss the 90's MuchMusic format, back when the programming actually covered music, and music related subjects. Yes, we live in a different era and they have to pander to what sells, I'm just disappointed. Please don't link me to the MTV guy ranting to people like me.

I thought she did a decent job with the interview, maybe a tad nervous, but that probably comes from being a big fan. I thought Maynard handled the tool related questions just fine, he more or less finger pointed towards the other guys at the end there, but that's nothing new.

<TEXT> I had a small click of friends that slowly expanded throughout high school, some of my expansion pack friends were more popular and went to parties with people who I generally didn't associate with (jocks and preps I believe were the terms we used back then). I recall going to one of these parties (somewhere around 1998), where the booze kicked in and I had the balls to stop the music that was currently playing, whatever it was I remember it being terrible. Either way I remember dropping on aenima that I had brought (I never left the house without 15-20 cd's and a discman in my backpack). I was expecting contorted faces of disgust and hatred, however stinkfist kicked in and everyone seemed to mesh to it, and it was awesome. Then I thought to myself, ok, this will all change when Die Eier Von Satan comes on. Waited patiently for that industrial German racket to begin with my troll face in gear. Again, a room full of people from all clicks just had the best time, it was the first time I think I realized that maybe it was me who was the asshole and not everyone else. It's like I shed a layer of hatred that night.

I have no idea why I just replied to your message with this.

<TEXT> My friend just sent me this link:

[http://www.redflagnews.com/environment-headlines/urgent-two-radcon-5-alerts-on-west-coast-within-48-hours-disturbing-video#sthash.r5bcV4br.dpbs](http://www.redflagnews.com/environment-headlines/urgent-two-radcon-5-alerts-on-west-coast-within-48-hours-disturbing-video#sthash.r5bcV4br.dpbs)

And I got to thinking that something seems awfully fear mongering about that video which leads me to believe there is some kind of hidden agenda. Not to say that nuclear waste seeping into the ocean isn't a huge concern for every person on the planet right now, but something about that video didn't seem right to me.

I just wanted some sort of scientific take on the matter. How imminently fucked are we really? Can it be contained? Does it require more attention from the world than it is getting? 

Thanks in advance.

<TEXT> That's not the point. I wasn't trying to promote self loathing here, more the idea of self realization, in that you are among the masses creating the traffic problem. It's a humbling and calming gesture to understand that every single person on the road around you would like to get home as badly as yourself. When the roads are as bad as they are we owe it to ourselves and each other to exercise extra precaution, and seeing each vehicle as another human being can help alleviate some of that anxiousness and frustration. I find that it works for me anyways, it's easy to ignore the thoughts and feelings of those around you when you're separated by metal cages.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> - New inexperienced drivers

- People with zero winter condition experience (from warmer climates)

- Impatient ~~20 something~~ people with giant 4x4 trucks who think they can         stop as fast as the can accelerate

- Old people/nervous drivers white knuckled at the first sight of moisture (this could go back to my first point)

- Tailgaters

- Insufficient snow clearing of Calgary roads

- Overpopulation (road design doesn't match population boom)

To me it's everyone in unison forming one giant problem. We are all to blame, whether or not you're the perfect driver, you're still in traffic, which to me makes you part of the problem. 

Just like the idea of the zipper merge on an engineer's notebook, it looked great on paper but as soon as you throw a bunch of different personalities behind it, it becomes a cluster fuck. I think patience for one another is the key to making our [drive time commute](http://youtu.be/Dvx5GL_9MD0) a little more tolerable.

I have to agree with /u/Ardal and the police on this matter. Let's all slow the fuck down, take a breath, and let's get home in one piece without having to call our insurance companies.

<TEXT> Hello Mr. Reznor.

First off I would like to simply say thank you, your music has accompanied me throughout the past 19 years of my life, I am a huge fan and very grateful for the wonderful music you have brought into this world.

1) As a new father my life has literally changed a great deal (for the better). I wanted to know how you deal with being away from your children while on tour, and how else being a father affects your career.

~~2) This question has probably been asked more times than anything else but here goes, I know that both you and Maynard came to an agreement that tapeworm wasn't ranked as a 10/10 by your standards, however, will we ever see a collaboration between you guys in the future? Do you guys keep in touch, and/or humor this idea?~~


Thanks for dropping by.

EDIT: Please ignore question two.

<TEXT> First off I want to give much thanks to /u/Xenophorge for the FREE floor ticket so that a friend of mine could make it, the four of us had a great time. I'd post the reddit love story picture, but I don't want to commit to putting my face on these parts just yet.

Having said that I want to say the show was fucking awesome, setlist had a little more top 40 than I would have liked but I could definitely live with it. The highlights for me without a doubt [Pino Palladino's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pino_Palladino) performance, the guy fucking nailed it and did it with such class and style. I really thought he fit the bill perfectly. Everyone seemed spot on and enthusiastic, however you could definitely sense how the tour was wrapping up though, almost as a sigh of relief from each performer. I won't say they were lacking energy, but  there was a definite aura of depletion in the air, in that each member was looking forward to resuming their family/home life.

I don't know if as a result of this the light show suffered a little or not. But we seemed to have missed out on a lot of the 3D effects that I have been seeing around these parts as of late. All in all it was amazing and I wouldn't have traded it for anything. 

Trent will never cease to amaze me as an artist, musician, and front man. The fact that he has managed to keep NIN relevant throughout my early teenage years and well into my adulthood blows me away. I hope he stays with us for decades to come. 

That is all /r/NIN, I just wanted to share a few quick thoughts with you. I love to hear what you guys think as well.

<TEXT> Sure, it's all good. My shark moose post was just the most recent to spark my attention. It's really not about what I post, but mostly what others do. I lurk here for the most part, and I rarely ever go to the front page of this sub, so if I made a repost as my argument point then I really only have myself to blame for that. Having said that though, this has been something I've noticed for over a year now. Again, maybe I only check in at the wrong times or something, in the end I find this place uneventful and boring, with a lot of downvote trolls. Is it just me or do very relevant comments  garner downvotes? I don't get it, like most subs there has to be a moment of self realization that the downvote button isn't a disagree button, perhaps this one has yet to understand that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> rant Yes /r/Newfoundland, I'm talking about you. I've been subbed since the beginning of my reddit life, and in that time I've noticed the horrible trend that established itself here as the norm. Seemingly every post I see that actually has to do with Newfoundland current events, culture, or politics becomes a barren waste land of downvotes and ignorance. I don't think I've come across one thought provoking comment section to date. Yet, when a fucking cartoon like Christmas tree from the goddamn Avalon mall gets posted, watch out, something all the St. John's yuppies can relate to. It's obvious who runs this place, and it's too bad. Much like Newfoundland itself, where 90% of the island is overlooked because of loud mouth St. John's walking around distracting everyone from what else is happening. Seriously, A POST ABOUT A GREENLAND SHARK CHOKING ON A MOOSE GETTING SAVED BY TWO RANDOM GUYS GOT DOWNVOTED BUT THAT GODDAMN CHRISTMAS TREE SPARKED DISCUSSION AND NOSTALGIA. Sorry, didn't mean to yell, but that was the last straw. I'll check back in a few years and see if you got your shit together. /rant </TEXT>

If I am to make a move, I want to make sure it's a smart one and in the right direction, with job stability for at least the next 40 years. I have a hands on skills with precision tooling, and mathematics has always been my area of interest. Although I don't feel it is necessary to continue working in the trades, I am also not opposed to it. 

I'd really love reddit's opinion on the matter.

My answer: "Yeah, they're called snuff and child pornography"

TL;DR: The only thing more depraved than those movies (in my mind) would be the true horrors of real life. I believe you read my reply out of context.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Blair posted this blurb today.](http://www.toolband.com/index_frames.html)


**FIRST "OPIATE" PRIZE WINNER?**

**It would appear that some lucky individual has won the first 'golden ticket' ("SEAL OF XATANITOS"), that was included in one of the first hundred or so 21st anniversary OPIATE CD packages that have been shipped out. From what I've been told, the winning 'seal' was inserted into the variation colored grayish-silver. Once I get all the details from Merch, I will post the name of the winner along with his or her photo.**


Looks like we'll find out what those seals are pretty soon.

EDIT: the greyish-silver is the [second variation](http://imgur.com/a/uSWpI) from what I can see. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I went to see one of my all time favorites tonight, Animals As Leaders, during their supporting show for Meshuggah here in Calgary, Alberta. Grabbed my tickets, got inside and got a beer. As the guy poured my beer he commented on what was supposed to be tonight's short concert. Asking why, he explained that Tosin of AAL tried to break up a fight in Boston between a cop and a rowdy concert goer, that turned out to be an obstruction of justice charge apparently. I couldn't fucking believe it.
So pissed I sold my tickets and left like a sulking baby. So heads up for anyone else anticipating an upcoming Animals As Leaders show in Canada.

**tl;dr** Animals As Leaders forbidden to travel internationally for the time being.

Edit: It was Javier Reyes, and not Tosin Abasi. Thanks Triangular_Desire. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have zero Photoshop capabilities, so I thought I would reach out to the Reddit community for some help to make these pictures a little more hilarious than they already are. I know they are kind of blurry, sorry about that.

Any help would be greatly appreciated! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Tool Pictures August 5th, 2009 Toronto Ontario </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-12-23 02:55:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I flew through Toronto to catch a Tool show on my way back from vacation in 2009. I was seated next to another dude flying solo at the show, he ended up taking a bunch of pictures, I asked him to email them to me and he came through, stand up fellow. [Thought I'd share.](http://imgur.com/a/sLvvN) 

It was your [standard 10000 Days setlist](http://toolnavy.com/showthread.php?t=114069). Also, [this](http://i.imgur.com/St1as.jpg) is the poster from the show, might be my favorite from the three I have.

Yeah some of them are blurry, but there are a few nice one's in there. Unfortunately this is the best resolution I have.

<TITLE> Call of Halo </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-11-07 05:47:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Am I the only one that thinks halo 4 multiplayer is vastly similar the Call of Duty series? I was never a fan of those games for many reasons, 1) Unfair advantages among players due to tactical load outs 2) Point count for wins 3) Weapon markers 4) Ordinance. This game may look/play nice but it's so far from halo that I find myself quite turned off, I miss that level playing field we all once had, where the good gained advantage with knowledge. Anyways just my two cents. Just curious if I am alone on this. Oh I forgot to mention the sounds, every standard halo noise is basically gone. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Please help, my elderly mother was a victim of a break and entering in Grand Falls Windsor! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-10-10 00:39:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey everyone, I'm at a loss as to where I'm supposed to turn next so I thought I would try r/newfoundland. My wonderful mother 74 years of age was a victim of robbery this past week. She has never been an overly wealthy woman, using what little wealth she has to support her very large family. Her house is small and quaint and doesn't contain many valuables (her television is tubed and her stereo is 15 plus years old, among the rest of her things that were left behind by the thieves). She has always been content with her humbled life and the only valuables she's ever really had came in the form of a few small rings passed down through the generations of our family. These rings of course hold no real monetary value (very small weight in gold), but the sentiments they hold in my mothers heart are unmatched. 

I know this is such a long shot but if anyone has seen or heard anything in regards to breaking and entering and the sale of used jewelry on the streets in the Grand Falls area, could you please let me or the police know. It would mean so much to her to actually retrieve these small items and/or see the culprits brought to justice.

I completely understand that there are problems in our society, and that drug addiction among other things, can bring people to carry out the unspeakable, but it breaks my heart knowing that there are those who prey on the elderly. It's about time these actions are taken seriously by the system, and the law works in favor of the victims.

If by some even slimmer chance someone who was directly involved manages to read this, if you somehow still have my mothers jewelry and have it in you to return it, I will most certainly not pursue this any further, I would walk away knowing that all hope isn't lost. I would forgive you personally, and I will hold that gesture in such high regard for the rest of my time on this earth. I do not wish to seek revenge, but to make things right.

If you think you might know something and require further description please PM me.

Thank you for your time. </TEXT>
