<TEXT> Fuck it, done. Like I  said, third time posting here, and why? Why do I keep on going through this shit? So here I am, fucking rock bottom. Let's look at what's happened with me, shall we?
I'm running hurdles. I think I'm pretty damn good. It was my very first year, never even took interest into sports until then. I get 4th or 3rd place. I was running with the big boys too. I thought my family would be proud, but fuck no. Dad never went to my meets, for he is in the Navy. Can it get worse? With my family? Of course. Everyone compares me to my cousin. Everyone say's she's a genius in school, yet I'm the one who leads her and tutor her. I'm even compared to her in my favorite sport: Hurdles.
I'm tired of the comparison. One day, I decided I loved movies and took up a hobby known as Visual Effects. With help from people like Gleb Alexandrov, I created this: http://imgur.com/VhhuCFd
I thought my family would be so proud, but rather everyone justs says, "That's cool and all, but did you see what your cousin did in her soccer game/hurdles?"
Then there's tonight, fucking tonight. I'm currently in High School, and I'm living with my divorced mom and my sister. My family members are SJWs , so I can't talk rude to my sister despite her talking rude to me. Anyways, we are all watching tv, and being the shit service AT T Uverse is, it stops working. I offer to fix it, but I fail. I tell my family that it's just AT T being shitty. And they fucking say,"Oh stop it, AT T is cheaper. Your just being ungrateful. Besides, you only have yourself to be mad it, you thought you could program it." Program it? Are we in a fucking 4chan cringe thread? How do you program a tv? I know OpenGL and Pixar's Renderman, not whatever shitty code language AT T uses. And then my family complains that I'm always grumpy.
What the fuck do I even do at this point? This has gone on for years and years and years, we have shitloads of pills everywhere. What am I to do? </TEXT>

<TEXT>   Okay. So, what we do is we create one big ass map in a 3d modeling program and compose a texture atlas. We export that as an fbx and bring it into unreal engine. Using gimp or photoshop, we create an even bigger ass image texture. Finally, we unwrap that kush and bam, a realistic map. I think this would do great with terrain, as Unreal Engine isn't good with rendering dirt or sand.
The only flaws I see with my idea is:
A: How do we get the image to unwrap in specific areas?
B: How big of an image would we need? </TEXT>

<TEXT>   Greetings Reddit, I think I'm done. 
I can't take it anymore! I have no one to talk to!
  I'm such a loser, one of my teachers has a strong disliking towards me, I live in my cousin's shadow, and my dad was never there for me...
  One day at school, I had had it. I was gonna do it. I tried to tell myself that I was being irrational. 
  I went to the counselor. They called my mom. Rather than being supportive or consoling, she got onto me for telling the school, saying that they're going to label me.
  I wanted to talk to my dad, but he is overseas. He doesn't give enough of a care.
  I have no one to talk to. I'm a popular guy, and have many friends, too many to count, but yet, I have no one to talk to! 
  My parents and my friends are only concerned for themselves. It's always them, not me...
  I can't tell you how many times I've been cheated out of birthday celebrations, or have never been called by my dad. 
  I can't do it Reddit!  </TEXT>

I want to create top-notch effects, to do this, I feel the only professional tools for me would be The Foundry's Nuke. The thing is, this costs $4000.

<TEXT>   I'm about to be 14, and would like to have a career as a filmmaker. I want my cgi to be top-notch. I want it to be so good, it gets featured on the Cgbros YouTube page. So, I would like to aquire a copy of The Foundry's Nuke. The thing is, this software costs about $4000. My parents won't let me get a job yet, so I've turned to r/beermoney. Being an avid user of the subreddit, I saw how someone went to Vegas on their "beermoney", so if they can go to Vegas, I can get Nuke, how hard can it be? Harder than you think my friends...Vindale looked very attractive, but my hopes were dashed when I found it charges you for the products you test. I turned to swagbucks, which promised $35 per survey, but my hopes were crushed yet again when I realized these offers are only to reel you in, after that you get a survey every two months for only $0.02.
  I need advice. What might I do? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Saw this on /3DCG/. The question was, "If I used a pirate bay torrent to download The Foundry's Nuke (A vfx Software) and use it to create little short films like FreddieW on YouTube, would it be illegal if I used Google Ads and made money off of the videos I created with the software I downloaded with a torrent?"

<TEXT>   Now don't get me wrong, there economic system was great. There was no such thing as poor in their society. They also were very good at making remedies for injuries and diseases and were skilled warriors. They survived against all odds. Now, I did't come here to argue over who is more developed. 
  I'm just wondering why was it that Europeans had gunpowder, more advanced science, advanced corporations and armies. They also had ships that could cross entire oceans and some of the Europeans had mastered the art of Gliding (People like Otto Lilienthal). 
 Why is it that they were technologically superior the the natives? </TEXT>

  Similar skirmishes probably happened when Homo Erectus, Neanderthal, and Sapien existed together 80,000 to 100,000 years ago.
  Homo Sapiens had the evolutionary advantage. They crafted bow and arrows, which were devastating weapons back then. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because, if you watched the videos I put links to, you'll see their massive numbers. Plus, that was only a small fraction of 4chan. Us Redditors have been a thorn in 4chans side, so some think they plan to launch a campaign. Plus they wouldn't stop at griefing, it would be followed by the hacking of admin accounts and Ddos attacks. </TEXT>

Look at that. I'd say the 4channers are Gods of pvp. They remind me of the Spartans. 

  So what happens if they raid c.nerd.nu? 
It has happened before. Reddit's official server has been raided by griefers originating from 4chan. We, as Redditors, are really a thorn in 4chan's side. So what happens when they come for the server of Reddit: c.nerd.nu?

<TEXT> Well, Reddit has had lots of enemies and has had a lot of flame wars. I think it's important to document these flame wars as they were crucial to the history of Reddit, especially the big flame wars which have effected the entire internet, like the feuds with 4chan. </TEXT>
