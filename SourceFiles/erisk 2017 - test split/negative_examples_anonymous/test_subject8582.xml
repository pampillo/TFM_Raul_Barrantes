<TEXT> My book backlog is beyond ridiculous. I find that my main problem is that while I'm reading, sitting in silence actually hurts my concentration. Of course, a lot of the music I've tried tends to be rather distracting (or at the very least, doesn't fit the mood). What are your thoughts? Any recommendations? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sci Fi- the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It's easily my favorite book of all time (the first sequel as well, the rest kinda got away from me) and outside of Foundation, a good candidate for greatest Science Fiction novel. 

That being said, the Foundation books are probably also on there. I can't say for certain, I've never actually finished them (sorry)

Superhero/Graphic Novel- Watchmen. Fuckin'... duh. 

Though as for graphic novels, I would also like to give a shoutout to the Neon Genesis Evangelion manga, if only because I love NGE, and the graphic novel is pretty spectacular.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is Wall Street

Back together

And I'll never have a recession at the hands of the stock market because we're doing much better

And the economy is saying "go get her"

The Upper Class ain't gonna follow your rules

Come at me without any of your commie fools

Let's go, just me and you

Let's go, my profits grew

Go ahead and overthrow me if you're able

Can't you see that the economy is stable

I can see you hate the way we trade under the table

But you're just mad your revolution's been disabled </TEXT>

<TEXT> According to Bruce Campbell, Evil Dead 2 actually is a sequel in the traditional sense. They couldn't get the rights to their own movie, so instead they made the first part of the movie a sort of modified recap of the first movie. If you took the end of ED1 (when Ash gets hit in the face with the first-person thing) and put it in ED2 when he gets hit again, you'd have the proper continuity.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It starts out with bands like One Direction to catch the defener crowd, but by the end of the show they're delving into more loved classic bands like the Beatles. "But /u/test_subject8582," I hear you asking "Surely there are people who would be perfectly accepting of the Beatles' songs 24/7. Many people probably already do that." So my solution: start off with their good stuff (first couple days alternate between Lucy in the Sky, Sgt Pepper, etc.) but as people refuse to leave, slowly start replacing songs with their worse songs (Swap out Yellow Submarine in the rotation for Octopus' Garden for example). By the season finale, we have people listening exclusively to Yoko Ono's contributions.  </TEXT>

Picollo could blow up the Moon, Nappa levelled an entire city (which might put him on Godzilla's level, considering he took a city busting meteor without so much as a scratch), Vegeta was apparently a *planet buster* (though that's apparently non-canon). And we can't forget how powerful the Destructo-Disc is. Godzilla doesn't stand a chance, much as I would like him to.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's no real *counter*evidence to the order being Rebuild then NGE, but there's almost no evidence in favor of that theory. NGE then Rebuild, on the other hand, has loads of evidence to suggest that it directly follows NGE in the grand timeline. Kaworu's dialogue in both his cameos in 1.11 and 2.22 as well as a couple lines in 3.33 imply that he's been through this before, while episode 24 has no such implications. Even a bunch of the Angels (notably Ramiel) are more powerful than they had been before. Combined with the red sea and potential Mass-Production Evangelion (from End of Evangelion) outline on the hill in the opening of 1.11, there's really not a lot to say that Rebuild isn't a sequel to something, assuming you buy into Time Loop theory at all, that is. 

Really, we'll probably end up getting confirmation one way or the other when 3.0+1.0 comes out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's Sadamoto's manga, which tells the same story, but with several minor (and some major) differences (For one, Kaworu shows up way earlier and is actually a full-fludged character). There's a couple other mangas as well, like Campus Apocalypse, but none of them are really very good like the original. 

Once you've gotten to every Evangelion medium, you could try some other, similar shows. Gunbuster was the first work of Evangelion's director, Hideaki Anno. It's also a great work which greatly influenced mecha, especially Evangelion. They also share similar themes and characters, to the point where Shinji seems like Gunbuster's Noriko with a dick. There's also Gurren Lagann, which is an incredibly badass sort-of-parody of Evangelion. Finally, Madoka Magica. In the most basic sense, it's Evangelion with magical girls instead of mechs.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My favorite fun Super Robot show is Gunbuster (and to a lesser extent, its sequel, Diebuster). Another Gainax mecha which TTGL takes heavy inspiration from (some people even claim that the end result of TTGL was an attempt to one-up the size of the Diebuster). IT's a classic that every mecha/anime fan should watch at least once. Considering TTGL is less of a show and more of a "best-of" video of mecha influence, a lot of it is taken straight from the playbook of Gunbuster. 

There's also Getter Robo and Mazinger, which I can't personally attest to, but are some of the other classic Super Robots that really shaped the genre (apparently someone cuts a planet in half in Shin Getter Robo)

If you start feeling depressed, hit up Evangelion. Alongside TTGL and Gun/Diebuster, it stands at the top of the Super Robot genre. It's the deconstruction of the genre, being much more character-focused and less action-focused (don't let that turn you off, I actually consider it the greatest anime of all time). While not enjoyable for the same reasons as TTGL, you should certainly watch it. Gurren Lagann was actually somewhat of a parody of Evangelion (when you watch the show you'll see what I mean. There's a lot of connections).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The only model of the 3DS that's compatible with amiibo is the New 3DS XL. The only amiibo compatible games for the N3DS are Smash Bros 3DS (Which works with every amiibo except Splatoon and Toad, so far), Code Name S.T.E.A.M. (which works with the Fire Emblem amiibos, so don't even trip cause you won't get your hands on one of those), Ace Combat Assault: Horizon Legacy (which works with most amiibos), and Xenoblade Chronicles 3D (Which only works with Shulk. In other words, no amiibo compatibility)

[here's](http://www.nintendo.com/amiibo/compatibility) the compatibility chart </TEXT>

<TEXT> This might be true for Red and Leaf, maybe even Gold and Crystal, but once legendaries and gods and all that get thrown into the plot, the whole theory goes right down the drain. Specifically, Arceus in Gen IV, Xerneas in Gen VI, and the whole plot of Gen V. The fact that God himself appears before you and deems you worthy of capturing him would imply that Lucas and Dawn are in fact humans of His design, not an android created by someone else. Because if he were to appear before the worthiest trainer, wouldn't it be the guy who designed your AI?

I think the theory that Pokemon's humans are actually Pokemon (and not humans as we know them) is still the strongest. It has the most supported evidence, and explains everything that would be explained by this theory. In the games, we see that Pokemon don't need to eat or sleep a long as they aren't damaged. Since the trainer never takes any damage, they can just keep going forever.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would recommend the original 21-24, followed by episodes 25/26. The Director's cuts seem to be more of a setup to End of Evangelion than the originals, which led more so into the original ending. They really only have some extra scenes (and one infamous scene from episode 24 cut shorter). If nothing else, it's easier to appreciate the director's cuts after having seen the original episodes. Also, the director's cuts lead directly into the film, as even the preview for episode 24' shows one of the scenes from the film. Going straight to EoE from episode 26 will leave you disoriented from a timeline standpoint.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The movie in question is called Death and Rebirth. It's technically in two parts. Death is just a 40 minute recap episode, and Rebirth is the first quarter-ish of End of Evangelion. So if you just watched the series, move on to End of Evangelion. 

Though you should remember to watch episodes 21-24 Director's Cut after episodes 1-26. Then EoE. I haven't seen anyone mention that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My favorites are actually a tie between Unit-01 and the Mass Production Units

Unit 01 just has an amazing design. I also love how badass she is when Shinji isn't in charge. 

The MP-Evas are really unnerving (or unNERVing i guess) since they look so... biological in their movements, despite the fact that they still give off the outward appearance of the robots. The other Evas don't do that. That and they have fuckin' sword-lances.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1) the first two angels had been around for a couple billion years, as they were the Seeds of Life that originally crashed to Earth. Second Impact took place in 2000, and scattered young, larval Angels all across the world to ultimately find their way to Tokyo-3. 

2) That's where they thought Adam, their father, was. They wanted to get back to him to be the vessel of the Third Impact. It was actually Lilith, they just figured that there couldn't be another AT Field as strong as their Seed of Life. 

3) they had different motives and scenarios for third impact. Gendo wanted to use it to see Yui again, while SEELE wanted to create a God out of humanity. 

4) Actually Adam (Unit-01 being the exception), but other than that you're spot-on. 

5) S2 engine. It's an organ that allows Angels to be perfect, self-sufficient, godlike life forms. It allows for them to pull from limitless power by harnessing the AT Field. This is why the Angels are just about immortal except for the core, which is the S2 engine. 

6) To make a very long story short, the Lance was packaged with both seeds of life. It was basically an emergency shutdown device for seeds of life so two didn't end up on the same planet. The Lance we see in the series was Adam's, which he used on himself during the First Impact after Lilith lost hers. 

7) She's a clone of Shinji's mother, Yui, with added Lilith DNA (I think). She also houses the soul of Lilith (except Rei II, who holds only a part, the other belonging to Unit-00) </TEXT>

<TEXT> From what I understand of your question, you *have* seen the series and want to buy it, correct? If not, all of these are in the order you should watch them (except Death and Rebirth, it's a glorified recap episode)

There's nowhere to legally digitally download any of the series to my knowledge, so I'll break down the releases by series:

NEON GENESIS EVANGELION:

There's been a couple releases on VHS, Laserdisc, and DVD. There's also an upcoming new DVD release and a Blu-Ray release which may or may not be coming to the West. The cheapest DVD box currently is ADV's "thin pack" Platinum Collection (you can find it on Amazon, but beware as there is a lot of bootlegging). This contains the whole series, plus the Director's Cut Episodes, in the highest available quality (until Blu Ray HD). It's the one I have. There's also another Platinum Collection, the "thick pack". Same contents, episodes 1-26/24'. But this one has many more bonus features, though the overall quality sufferers for it. 

TL;DR: If you want cheap(ish) but good image quality, Thin Platinum. If you can spend more and don't mind slightly lower image quality of it means more content, then the Thick Platinum. If you want both and want to try your luck, you can wait for the New DVD or Blu-Ray. 

DEATH AND REBIRTH

Don't even bother. It's getting included with End of Evangelion anyway. 

END OF EVANGELION

This had a couple DVD releases from Manga Entertainment and another company who I don't remember. It's expensive as FUCK for a U.S. copy of the DVD ($100+, MIN). If you have a multi-region DVD player (or a PC), just import an English copy from the UK. For whatever reason it's really cheap across the pond. This is also getting re-released on Blu-Ray, though no confirmation of a new DVD has come up. This brings us back to D+R. The Blu-Ray of NGE includes "Revival of Evangelion", which is the final cut of Death (the recap half of Death and Rebirth) cut together with the final cut of End of Evangelion. 

TL;DR: **GOD SAVE THE QUEEN**

Evangelion 1.11: You Are (Not) Alone

This one's been pretty easy to find, but there *is* some fuckery afoot. There also exists a release on DVD and Blu-Ray of Evangelion 1.01, which is just a non-remastered version of the same movie that came out, then they realized there was some work that needed to be done, hence 1.11. (1.0 is the theatrical version). In my experience, buying 1.11 is cheaper, plus it includes the old version in case you're a masochist. 

TL;DR make sure there's no zeroes

Evangelion 2.22: You Can (Not) Advance

This time there wasn't even a 2.02 release. Choose DVD or Blu Ray and give Anno your cash. 

Evangelion 3.33: You Can (Not) Redo

This one isn't out in the West yet. If you hate dubs with a passion, then you can import a DVD or Blu Ray from Japan, but if you want a dubbed release from Funimation we're still waiting on that shit. 

Sadamoto's manga

The official manga has four 3-volumes-in-one releases, plus standalone releases for volumes 13/14. Check Barnes and Noble, they should have something.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Allow me to play Devil's Advocate, as someone who watch intently the brutal death of the music game genre. 

~~It was a few years before the end of the last console generation. There was exactly one game that most people point to when they talk about the downfall of music games: DJ Hero. It was similar enough in concept to Guitar Hero, everyone was pretty excited for some fan-favorite techno influenced songs. But the controller... The controller is one of the most fucked up abominations to come out after the Power Glove. Even the Kinect laughs at the DJ Hero controller. This ruined the game, and made everyone realize what they were doing wasn't fun, it was just a glorified quicktime event-filled music player. This is when the entire market realized that music games really did make them look like tremendous twats who could just as easily be streaming the same songs on the internet for free. It was with that game that the genre died down to a couple releases a year, after both Rock Band and Guitar Hero kind of gave up.~~

So the defener could be interpreting an electronic-influenced song as harkening back to the death of the genre, the worst thing one can do when trying to revive the genre. 

Or he could just be a pretentious asshole, either one really. 

Edit: there's also the possibility that I'm a fuckin idiot who doesn't know what he's talking about. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The question was about Second Impact, which was merely the result of a contact experiment between a human and Adam. Every single Impact was a result of the combination of Lilith and Adam. First Impact was when Lilith landed on Earth, terraforming it for Lilin and requiring Adam to be impaled on his Lance. 2I was the contact experiment- no Lilith soul involved. 3I was souls and bodies, in as well as the combination of Unit-01 and Zeruel's S2 engine, AND the combination of Ascended Unit-01 and the Adam-based MP-Evas. That's why 3I was able to start instrumentality.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> From what I can tell, the only ingredients for an Impact is the combination of Lilith and Adam, not their souls specifically. During Second Impact, the combination was the body of Adam with the flesh of the Lilith-based humans. Lilith herself still had her soul, back under the city eventually known as Tokyo-3.  </TEXT>

His factory is also several square miles, violating his property and moving into the private property of the surrounding city. He can't have let any health inspectors into his factory, and I refuse to believe his been paying taxes. He's housing potentially thousands of illegal immigrants.

<TEXT> Simon the Digger vs Shinji Ikari, I guess. I want to say Unit-01 could actually win, simply because I like NGE more than Gurren Lagann, but if Simon had transformations beyond Arc-Gurren Lagann then Eva gets rekt. If not, then it ends up being a classic battle of unmovable object vs unstoppable force. Bizzaro-Lagann could take it, since as he gets more and more scared of losing, he's going to get stronger and stronger, which will eventually result in him being stronger than Simon with all the Spiral Power in the universe. The question is if Simon kills Shinjimon before he can accumulate the power required to kill GL with pure bitchliness. I give it to simon 6/10, but if it were anyone other than Simon i would actually give it to Bizarro GL.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most of my favorite fictional women I actually like for their character, not out of lust. I could stand Mothra trying to seduce me or 24 hours (though that would be funny as hell). Bayonetta would be harder, but since she's built like Slenderman with some well-placed fruit in his outfit, I think I could last if a million dollars were on the line. One day simply isn't enough to be worth a million. Now if I got to spend the rest of my life with her in exchange for a million dollars, that would be different.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have the omnibus version. It's much cheaper, and when you have all four together they look pretty nice. 

EDIT: There are a few cons, come to think of it. Volumes 13 and 14 are still only available in the seperate volumes, giving you four monoliths of Eva mangas and two tiny little books at the end. hopefully they'll do an Omnibus release to have those two included as well, preferably alongside Volume 12 so it can be a full End of Evangelion package.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My favorite Pokemon is Braviary. 

Braviary isn't the most *supernaturally* powerful of all the Pokemon, but its strength will fit right in in the Capital Wasteland. Not to mention the fact that its pure patriotism is rivaled only by... Liberty Prime, actually. The Enclave wouldn't beef with someone patriotic enough to pal around with a red, white, and blue eagle, especially when that eagle can wreck an entire platoon of power armored soldiers with one Return. If we take the place of any random NPC, we'll be fine. We probably have enough strength to take a settlement like the supermarket, then defend it while still being on the good side of one of the major factions. If we take the place of the Lone Wanderer, then things get a little tougher since I can't have Dogmeat. Plus, being hunted down by anyone might end up with them sniping my bird. 

NPC: We live long, healthy lives

PC: We don't make it to the end.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Contrary to popular belief, Gojira may well be the worst film to start out on. It's gritty, it's dark, and it's almost completely different from every other film in the franchise. The best one to start out on is probably new, American Godzilla. It doesn't have the problem of the special effects that most people find hard to overlook until they're already fans of the series. After that, I would say Godzilla vs Mothra (1964) as that is probably the best monster mash in the franchise.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt is somewhat similar, though it's a straight-up comedy, less than it is an action show. It's pretty similar in that it's also a sexualized parody of Magical Girl shows. iirc, the soundtracks are also done by the same person. 

Also, it's not really an anime, but Bayonetta is kinda similar. You might want to try out watching/playing that.  </TEXT>

-shorten the "serious" arc where they were on Earth post-time skip

-maybe extend the final fight by like 7 minutes

-add a giant new form of TTGL made out of Kamina's soul

-give Yoko a Tengen Toppa Titty Tank

<TEXT> I'm not an expert on the Mandarin, but from the thread it doesn't seem like a full-powered Bayonetta would have too much with him. At her full power, she took down both the god of her universe (or at least, its presumed creator) and the man who was nigh-omnipotent by stealing the full power of several gods. The only thing Mandarin can do to harm her is going to be the matter manipulation, which Bayonetta has overcome before with Jubileus and Aesir. The speedblitz could be an issue, making Witch Time a bit less effective, but in the Balder fights in Bayonetta 2 she's already proven that she can fight enemies much faster than her. 

Bayonetta wins.  </TEXT>

Thing is, my invulnerability will mean that I get a good ninety or so years to fight Bayonetta. I'm to weak to ever hope to do any damage to her, unless I was able to become a witch/lumen sage, in which case I'd eventually be able to wear her down enough to beat her. Knowing Bayonetta, there's a good chance she'd just get bored and leave before I was able to wear her down.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd like to nominate Terminator 3 as a sequel to T2. It's not just that it's a bad movie from a different director with a poor premise. It's that its very existence undermines the story and themes of T2. 2 was a movie about defying fate and forging your own path to the future, the success of which was unique for what is, at its most basic level, a prophecy movie. T3 tore down the accomplishments of Sarah Connor to nothing more than a setback for fate. After watching T3, I could barely even enjoy T2 again, knowing that their struggle in that movie was ultimately pointless. 

So a sequel that actively ruined the original, that's why I think Terminator 3 is the worst.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The End of Evangelion, because it is literally the ending to the TV series. It was what they intended before they ran out of money. It also happens to be one of the greatest films ever made in my own opinion, so absolutely check that out. 

After you clean your brains off of the wall behind you, you may want to move on to the Rebuild saga. 1.11 is a remake of the episodes until the fifth angel, 2.22 deviates into its own story, and 3.33 is completely different.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We all know that in order to beat Spiral Power on the level of STTGL, you'd need to be no one short of Revelation Jesus. But is there anyone on the other end who can defeat STTGL by flying under the radar for long enough to take out the pilots?

From what I can gather, Simon is the only pilot that matters, and everyone else is basically just a Spiral Power generator. This would mean that anyone who can take out Boota, Yoko, or any of the insignificant side characters, can cripple it at least back to TTGL. But who's the strongest who's weak enough to take STTGL all the way back to five-meter mode? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Didn't Ash become homies with God himself during one of the movies?

Regardless, I'm actually going to say no. Ash has had a lot of powerful friends (just about *every* pokemon that wasn't available except by events, what a coincidence!) but he has very little battle skill, next to no knowledge of matchups (he seems to bank on Spiral Power rather than strategy). Even if Ash had all this, Mewtwo is insane during his time under Giovanni. Ash has no chance in a one-on-one, regulation Pokemon battle. Mewtwo is the closest thing Kanto has to a demigod, and no single pokemon could hope to take him down. Maybe if Ash has them all in a row and gradually wears Mewtwo down, but it isn't very likely.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll tackle them one at a time:

O-Ren: Without the Crazy 88s to wear down the Bride, she's going to have the upper hand. That isn't to say this battle will be easy for either of them, but it'll be easier for the Bride than the original battle since she won't fall down as much. The battle ends when the Bride disarms O-Ren and takes advantage of that oppurtunity.

Vernita: We only really know of Vernita as being on par with the Bride when they both wield knives. As her weapon of choice seems to be a butcher knife, she probably won't pose much of a problem against a knife-wielding Bride. Whenever she tries to parry with her knife(ves?), there's a good chance she'll just miss the parry completely and get slashed up. 

Elle Driver: This may be the most even battle. Both are nearly equal in sword fighting ability. If anything, Elle is actually more skilled than the Bride. But she wants so badly to utterly annihilate the Bride in the field of battle. She doesn't know when to hold back as opposed to going for a kill, which will ultimately be her downfall. She'll lose her other eye (again) at which point the Bride finishes her off. 

Budd: Fuck if I know. He had to resort to using ambush and we never actually got to see him fight. If he had, there's a good chance a dude with a shotgun can take out a woman with a sword. But, with her acrobatic ability, there's a good chance she'll be able to disarm Budd, which will cause his immediate defeat. 

And finally, Snake Charmer himself. He is apparently even better than the Bride with a Hanzo sword (though he decided that their duel wouldn't be very fruitful for either party). By this point, the Bride will have been worn down by her other opponents. That being said, she'll fight even harder than ever before. The fight ends similarly to how it ends in the movie, with the one attack Bill couldn't foresee: the five-point-palm exploding heart technique. He has a monologue and walks his five steps, defeated.  </TEXT>

Germany, on the other hand, realizes that the Nazi administration was just about the evilest thing they could do and has gone out of their way to stop it from happening again.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> If one were to take all the magical girls, from Madoka Kaname to Sailor Moon, and average them out, that would be the first fighter. Keep in mind that the *most* powerful magical girl is probably Madoka, as she became God. 

1: how powerful is this average magical girl? Who can she beat?

If one did the same things for mechas, from the glorified forklift from Aliens up to Super Tengan Toppa Gurren Lagann (and the Infinity Jeager) that would be fighter number two. 

2: how powerful is this mech? What can it beat? Who is its pilot?

3: the two do battle. Who wins? At what cost?

4: Both are competing for the same time slot on Toonami. Who wins? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-03-07 01:35:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's the silliest thing we all noticed the second or third time through Back to the Future. The timeline takes a whole week to catch up to Marty after he almost makes his parents not get hitched. This even seems to contrast the other two movies and how time acts there. But it actually doesn't work this way. 

The indicator (the photo in the first movie) is not actually displaying not the future Marty comes from as he changes it, but rather the possibilities of how each subsequent timeline changes the photo. By screwing up his parents meeting, he creates an infinite number of timelines, each of which has a different string of events following the accident. As time goes on, many of these events are narrowed out because that's how time works. Once those are gone, the timelines resulting in his parents not getting married become more and more likely until (at the Dance) Marty's existence becomes so unlikely that he wouldn't be able to save them in any way if it weren't for the fact that he *knew*. So the indicator is the only reason the chance wasn't straight-up zero, and how he was able to create one of the only sequences of events leading to his birth.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's gotta be one of the Pokemon games. Particularly Pearl, Platinum, or Soul Silver, since when I was younger (second or third grade when Pearl came out) I didn't have a whole lot of games. To this day, I consider the core Pokemon games the best game series of all time, since all of them are least an 8/10 for me. Over all the games, I can't imagine I've clocked less than 1000 hours.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, not really. It's a similar sort of surrealist imagery centering on one woman. The only thing it really has in common with End of Evangelion is the non-pelvic vagina, which isn't really reminiscent of EoE in particular.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It implies this happens after some scenario of End of Evangelion. 

HOLD UP. This actually just occurred to me as I write this, but what if that is the outline of an Eva that went down fighting and securing Tunniel. According to people on this sub, Tunniel appeared in the fifteen years after Second Impact replacing Sachiel as the harbinger of the Angels' return. So if Tunniel had to be captured, what if Unit-00, Null, or Rei in 01 managed to take down Tunniel </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know where in Jersey you are, so I can't give specific recommendations, but my general advice is this: 

Try and find a small pizza shop in town owned by an Italian-American couple (preferably named Joseph and Marie, but that's entirely optional). Big-name pizza places like Domino's and Papa John's are usually pretty bad, at least by Jersey standards. New Jersey (as well as NYC and a little bit North into Connecticut) has a near-endless supply of local restaurants who know how to make pizza right. Walking around in town for a bit should yield results.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depends on where in Jersey you live. Plenty of responses here have some good NJ pizza, but my general advice is either to use Yelp (or some equivalent) or to find a small, non-chain pizza place by just walking around. Chances are you'll find a good thin-crust pizza with that method. 

If you live in or around Princeton, I can personally recommend Conte's and Pizza Star. For Mercerville, I would say DiLorenzo's.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Neon Genesis Evangelion and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Two Gainax mechas, considered by many to be the pinnacle of their genre. So is it possible that they're really one and the same? 

Both feature a magical power based on the soul of the user, namely AT fields and Spiral Power. They both serve many purposes, the main one being an "explain everything" scapegoat. The main antagonists of the shows (SEELE and the Antispiral) wish to rid the universe of ATSpiral as it is an evolutionary dead end that will lead the universe to destruction. 

Let's look at the Antispiral, actually. It's a being formed from the collective souls of a spiral race formed into one. SEELE wanted to complete the Human Instrumentality Project to being their species into one collective consciousness and rid themselves of the need for individual AT Fields. They also have proven to be fans of giant robots, which would explain the Granzeboma. So Gurren Lagann could be a reality in which Third Impact went according to plan, and SEELE got to try and rid the universe of humanity.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-02-26 01:11:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In 2.22, Tunniel is the Third Angel, meaning it arrived before Sachiel. It presumably arrived at the same time as Adams and Lilith, considering Sachiel was still the first angel to arrive for 15 years. And its designation is the *third* angel, meaning it is in fact separate from the Adams and Lilith. And SEELE, holders of the Dead Sea Scrolls, have also confirmed it to be the Third. Both of the Angels who showed up around Second Impact were seeds of life, so if Tunniel showed up around that time as well, that means there's a good chance we're missing a whole other seed of life. It could also explain where the Spear of Cassius/other Longinus came from since Lilith lost hers in First Impact.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think I'm actually as religious as I am due in part Evangelion. I was pretty passively religious when I started, being a teenage child of a Christian family. I watched the first four episodes and my only thoughts on the religious imagery were "Oh, it's kind of like if Gundam let Jesus into its heart. I bet we're in for some edgy but ultimately meaningless symbolism." I came out of it still kind of believing that, but it was mostly silenced by something along the lines of **"WHAT IN THE EVERLOVING CRUCIFUCK DID I JUST WATCH"**. Then after the required analyses of the show and its symbols, I started to gain a deep appreciation for not just the religious aspects of Eva, but of Christian lore.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gamera wasn't Toho, though they did make the '90s movies. 

Anyway, I think after Rodan, Toho started to focus more on Godzilla again. Once King Kong vs Godzilla came out, there wasn't much time for a new Rodan movie because he was in the one after that. The only reason Mothra got her own trilogy is because she was so immensely popular, particularly among women, to the point that Toho decided to appeal to that demographic in particular.  </TEXT>

Restrictions? Probably a grass-type with photosynthesis. Or something that doesn't need to eat at all so I can save on resources. So probably a Porygon-Z, so I can break into stuff.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This Wolf O'Donnel bitch organized a Super Smash Bros tournament in my town the other day. He had the standard tournament rules- set stages, double elimination, no items, etc. He would only make an exception for games he was in. He only plays Diddy Kong, so when no one was looking before his match he would set the banana item spawn to as low as it goes. His idea was that since Diddy Kong's Down+B summons a banana anyway, no one would notice the subtle extra banana that would spawn. It didn't even affect his games, he just gets off to the knowledge that he did what he did.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Assuming Godzilla's feats are scaled down from 100m (Final Wars) to 2-3m, each Xenojira is about 3% of the original Goji's power. This means that 100 of them will be 300% of Godzilla's destructive power in total (thanks fan calculations). While I admit I've only seen Alien once, the GojiMorph will still be pretty tough to kill. Each individual Godzilla won't do anything to the GojiMorph, so all the Xenojiras (or at least 33) would have to work together. This poses somewhat of a problem, because Godzilla (Showa fuckness notwithstanding) is more of a lone wolf. After Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla (the '70s one), Godzilla only ever teamed up with Mothra in Final Wars (and even that wasn't really Godzilla and Mothra teaming up, that was Mothra coming in to kill Gigan and Keiser Ghidorah, and Godzilla just happened to be there). 

I suppose the Xenojiras have enough resistance and recovery to realize they can't go it alone, and one will eventually realize that organizing into two or three groups to take down the Gojimorph.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We were at a local burger place and I was starting to worry, because I know what this little coywolf does in public. But what happened next didn't start with him. Someone a few tables away started having a heart attack. I saw Wolf's eyes light up as he realized that this is what he had been waiting for the entire time. He ran over and ordered a bystander to call 911, checked for a pulse, and gave mouth-to-mouth expertly, as though he ad been professionally certified. It was when he got to chest compressions that the dark truth behind his fucked-up plan was revealed. I only found this out later, but it turns out he actually hangs out at restaurants all over town and waits for people to need CPR. Turns out he actually *tries* to break as many ribs as he can manage while doing the chest compressions. 

The worst part is that because of Good Samaritan laws, nothing he does is *technically* illegal. No one even thinks to try him because he puts on such a good act, consoling their friends or family (if they're present) and most times even checking up on them in the following weeks.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the theatrical cut if Army of Darkness, Ash returns to his time and saves the day from a Deadite at S-Mart. In the Director's Cut ending, we see he sleeps a century too long. The assumption is that this is the effect of a Third World War while he was asleep. But what if it was the result of the return of the Deadites during the extra century? He isn't awake to stop the Deadite at S-Mart, so that Deadite was able to take over the world starting from there.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Santa Claus vs PC Jesus Christ </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-23 04:13:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The year is 2014. the King of Kings has gotten fed up with jolly old Saint Nick hogging the spotlight on the celebration of *His* birth. So, he challenges him to a competition. If Jesus wins, he gets Christmas. If Santa wins, Jesus backs down as humanity's messiah and God's right hand. 

RULES: Unless specified, Jesus doesn't get to use any feats from Revelation. He is out of character, and willing to fight rather than just pacify the situation. Santa gets his feats from all depictions **of him**. That is to say, Saint Nicholas gets feats from his various depictions. Other Santas, like Arthur Christmas, Futurama's Santa, the Grinch, Odin, and Tim Allen, **all don't count toward Santa's feats**. As long as it's Nick himself, everything else is fair game. 

Round 1: Standard bout. Post-Crucifixion Jesus Christ (PCJC). Takes place in Jerusalem. Santa gets two days of prep, no weapons. 

Round 2: They switch jobs. Jesus has to deliver all the presents, Santa has rule over the world for a night. Whoever does the other's job better wins. 

Round 3: Jesus' Super Smash Bros game of choice. Both will be using gamecube controllers (because let's be real it isn't the N64 game). Santa gets a month of training with the top competitive Smash players. 

Round 4: Swimsuit competition. 

Round 5: They are both tasked with converting an extremely cynical, closed-minded atheist to believing in them. Whoever can make him believe first without pulling anything supernatural wins.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> World War III has been initiated by the Illuminati and now the POTUS is the mot stereotypical American possible: fat, gun-loving, communazi-hating, overly consumerist, favorite movie is probably Saving Private Ryan or something, you know who I'm talking about. The rest of the planet is either ruled by the Fourth Reich or the Communist Empire (I'm creative, I know). Siding with either is a guaranteed victory with the same spoils for America, choosing to side with neither is guaranteed destruction. 

EDIT: BONUS ROUND: There is a fourth army in this war, led by Magneto. His army is significantly smaller and the same strength as the Commies and Nazis. Again, the only change in this is who is helping America, they will still win no matter who they choose.  </TEXT>

Because Third Impact has been avoided in this continuity, NERV now blows their government funding on giant robot fights for sport. These fights have pilots get in their Evas, but then the Evas are forced to go berserk because... reasons. The berserk mama bears fight in an arena setting. How does Sarah Connor fare against...

1) Eva-00

2) Eva-02

3) The MP-Eva series

4) The Angels (yeah, we cloned the Angels back to life. What are you gonna do?

4) Eva-01

All Evas are, of course, berserk.

<TEXT> Assume the kaiju aren't going to act like assholes while off duty. They have to defend the crucified Lilith from the angels in the same manner as the original anime, starting with Sachiel. NERV will find the Lance of Longinus at the same time that they originally did. They also get to use the A.T. Field things that Unit-13 had in 3.33. 

**If the team gets angelstomped too hard, they can start again with these modifications. 

Godzilla is the version from Final Wars. **Also gets Spacegodzilla

Mothra is also her FW incarnation. **Mothra Leo with all his BS tranformations

Rodan is Fire Rodan because regular Rodan sucks. **Also gets Megaguirus. 

King Ghidorah is his GvKG incarnation, and if he ever dies he can be rebuilt as Mecha King Ghidorah. **Replaced by Desghidorah, 

Mechagodzilla is Kiryu from Tokyo SOS. **Kiryu and MOGUERA (from Spacegodzilla)

EDIT: Also when Tabris does arrive instead of seducing Shinji he seduces Minya.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The combined cast of: Godzilla (all of them in their most recent film incarnations) and Pacific Rim, plus Clove, Clifford the Big Red Dog, several explicitly named Pokemon, and Gamera are put onto one island arena. No one is allowed to leave (think Destroy all Monsters). This is where your fave comes in. They are parachuted into the middle of the island with nothing but their usual gear and a GPS showing where any given kaiju is located. Can your favorite character kill every kaiju on the island? 

Kaiju list:

Godzilla: Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah, Rodan, Gigan, Mechagodzilla (70s), both MUTOs, Zilla, Orga, Baragon, Varan, Biollante, Destoroyah, Spacegodzilla, Hedorah, and Minya. 

Pacific Rim: Onibaba, Knifehead, Yamarashi, Mutavore, Leatherback, Otachi, Raiju, Scunner, Slattern 

Pokemon: Groudon, Kyogre, Rayquaza, Ho-Oh, Lugia, Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres

BONUS: They get to call in one Mass Production Evangelion for help, BUT all the kaiju will bum-rush them.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Rebuild of Evangelion] Mari Illustrious Makinami is actually Kyoko Zeppelin Soryu (AKA Evangelion Unit-02) from the original timeline </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-21 02:25:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This one kind of operates on the assumption that Time Loop Theory is true, but realistically we all know it is. Especially Anno. 

Mari is the backup pilot for Unit-02, when it's made clear in NGE (and *heavily* implied in Rebuild) that Eva pilots can only do so because the soul inside the Eva is their mother, which allows for them to synch properly. Asuka is the designated pilot of Unit-02, because the soul of Kyoko is inside it (her?). When Asuka is out of commission following Unit-03's activation and possesion by Bardiel, Mari takes over as pilot of 02. But she shouldn't be able to, because no one named Illustrious is the soul of 02. Not only should she not be able to pilot it, but she unlocked its ability to transform (which Asuka later ended up using). If Rebuild is truly post-EoE, Kyoko could have brought herself back from the sea of LCL as her perfect self (look how similar [they](http://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/122523.jpg) [are](http://media.animevice.com/uploads/0/4479/384373-makinami_mari_illustrious74_large.jpg)) in order to continue protecting the next Asuka. This Asuka, however, was not her equivalent's child, due to the fact that the original was still around. This Asuka belonged to someone with the name of Shikinami. That person was presumably another scientist at Gehirn (potentially even the doctor that original Asuka's dad hooked up with when Kyoko was in the hospital) who then became new Unit-02. This would explain the redesign and upgrade. As a soul formerly known as an Eva, she is also able to pilot Unit-05 and Mark.08.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Where did 3.33 go wrong? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-18 17:10:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just got finished rewatching 3.33 to try and figure out why I don't like it. Maybe this has something to do with me not having seen any Eva for a month or so, but I found myself actually enjoying it more the second time around. So what *did* go wrong? What went right? Should it be considered as bad as some consider it?

Well for starters, about half of the movie is exposition or setup with no real answers. You have the opening, AKA "Get out of the fucking robot, Shinji". Then you have Shinji trying to make nice with "Rei", then the only character development in this movie (which to be fair is quite good at making you care for both Kaworu and Shinji), then "We reveal what everyone already figured out halfway through 2.22 even if you didn't see the original" with Fuyutsuki, then  "Get in the fucking robot, Shinji" from Kaworu, Kaworu explains what *Totally* happened during "Near"-Third Impact (seriously we saw you impale him with the Cassius what the hell), then Kaworu says some cryptic shit interlaced with the fight against WILLE and then the movie ends. This movie fails in a few regards because of this: NGE had very little explanation, leaving most exposition up to a few cryptic conversations where much is spoken but not much is said. This leaves the viewer to come up with their own conclusions as to what was going on in EoE, or what SEELE's motivations were. These questions make sure NGE stays in the viewer's mind, making it one of the most memorable stories in all of history. 3.33 tries to repeat this, but where it falls short is that most of the questions it leaves have only one logical answer. "What is the Vessel of Adams?" it makes the viewer wonder, then they think and say "Oh, wait, it probably has something to do with the Angels and Instrumentality. Rei-ish is probably like Kaworu with boobs and a bowl cut". NGE had questions with *really* ambiguous answers that are so open-ended that they are still being debated to this day. 3.33 tries to be a regular movie where all your questions are answered so any unanswered questions become plot holes, but also tries to keep its artsy "leave shit up to the viewer" movie like End of Eva. 

3.33 also had very little character development As a follow-up to 2.22, we already know most of these characters. We know who the main characters are (or at least are meant to be, some of the more complex characters like Asuka have had life sucked out of them in favor of being a 2D tsundere with no real character whatsoever to the point where I've started calling her Asuka-ish). But these characters have become different people to who they were 14 years prior. They either needed more development or none at all. Pick one. And then they have the balls to throw in a new character with no development whatsoever in Mari "Deus Ex" Makinami. She just shows up during action sequences to be a comic foil to Asuka-sh and fetish material to everyone else (because the original had *nothing* to say about fetishizing teenage girls in anime. DAMNIT ANNO DID YOU EVEN WATCH EVANGELION). Whereas NGE was almost entirely character with little to no exposition, occasionally broken up by giant robot action, 3.33 was the exact opposite, being no character and lots of exposition/robots. 

That being said, what 3.33 does right, it does *right*. The new robots look great (they even have a 'Mark.# naming system so we don't confuse them with the Mass Production Evas). Kaworu and Shinji share some great chemistry together, some of the scenes are pretty damn atmospheric, and the hellish imagery is greatly effective, even some of the more subtle things like Shinji being the third thing they removed from Unit-01, and it's implied that what they found in there wasn't even human. There is a lot that's left to the imagination, like what else they retrieved from Unit-01, or what how Kaworu planned to use the spears. But it's held down by the fact that it's nothing but a retread of Episode 24 of the original, which tries to explain things but keeps holding itself back for that unique street cred. 

So is 3.33 as bad as some people say? I actually have two answers. As a standalone movie, or even as the third movie in the Rebuild saga (independent from NGE) I'd say it's pretty good. No masterpiece, but it's a decent sequel to 2.22 and presumed prequel to 3.0+1.0. The character development does leave some things to be desired, but it does a good job of not holding your hand. The hellish imagery adds a lot to the overall quality and it's appropriately subtle in a lot of places. Rebuild is a must-watch for any fan of Mecha. 

As an Evangelion movie, however, I'm gonna go ahead and say it's almost, but not quite, fucking garbage. It is the antithesis to everything Neon Genesis stands for, from its bland characters (except maybe Kaworu), to its "baby's first mindfuck" approach to Fourth Impact, to its sine-waving between Evangelion's "open to interpretation" plot and an easy to understand plot. Holding it up to the original, it's NOT subtle in any way, shape, or form. Obviously it's more subtle than Pacific Rim or Gurren Lagann, but it lacks the meta commentary, complex characters, and even the heart of NGE. The first half completely ignores the rest of Eva and effectively resets the universe, while the second half is just a drawn-out, over-the-top version of Episode 24. Rebuild (I've dropped the 'Of Evangelion' in the hopes that it might become true) has to make up for this with 3.0+1.0 if it wants any credibility. Just watch the last three episodes and you'll be good.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Rebuild of Evangelion: The Rebuilds are actually Gendo's perfect world during Instrumentality </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-10 02:55:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After Gendo Ikari is "eaten" by a naked Unit-01 during Third Impact, his soul is added to Instrumentality. The world he exists in and refuses to return from after Giant Naked Rei is killed is the one that exists in Rebuild. The first is a complete retread of his memories, knowing what he knows he added some things from the real world (red seas, MP-Eva outline) he sees where he went wrong and could make a change in regards to Shinji, by adding a new person to the mix, namely Mari Ilustrious Makinami. The reason she's a Mary Sue is because she represents Gendo's paradise, not unlike Kaworu for Shinji. Speaking of gay alien Jesus, he remembers the original because he's an Angel, and therefore infiltrated Gendo's world, once again like for Shinji. In Gendo's perfect world, he kills SEELE, the only people who were stopping his Instrumentality scenario. Going back to EoE, in his final moments, Gendo regretted his treatment of Shinji and his last words were an apology to his son. So all the *slightly* not-as-shitty-but-still-mostly-shit that Shinji suffers through in Rebuild (not being able to see the Dummy System kill Bardiel, not killing Kaworu with his own hands, being a hero and getting the girl in 2.22, etc.) was a result of that.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Prisoner File] Prisoner 425862-JA-IIWY: Amir Valerie Blumenfeld </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-01 02:22:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **Name:** Amir Valerie Blumenfeld (also goes by "Vance", "DJ Schmumu", and various combinations of his name and "Jacob Hurwitz")

**Identification code:** 425862-JA-IIWY

**Biography:** This prisoner's past is inconsistent at best. As best we can gather, he was brought illegally from Canada to New York state, where his abusive parents raised him, teaching him to drive at 4. He was verbally and physically abused, and every time he was deemed a disappointment, his father moved houses. It is known that Amir was neighbors with a child named Penis Anthony Dooblinge (who recently changed his name to Roboert Cut off my own Penis Fatty Fatty Narr Narr Smoke A Bowl Full Of Sour Cream Veggie Burrito Penis) Amir was abducted from a shopping mall when he was six years of age and returned at the age of 11. He had forgotten how to speak and survived on a diet of chicken nuggets, a diet which still persists into his 30s. He repeated second grade an apparent total of 8 times, then managed to reach sixth grade without talking for four years, when he did eventually speak he was returned to second grade due o his illiteracy in math and English. It is unknown how much time passed before he got an internship at Collegehumor, where he still works, with no apparent job despite being employed. As a result of his upbringing, he seems to suffer from delusions of grandeur. 

**Known crimes:** Innumerable counts of attempted murder and aggravated assault, arson, prank calls to 911, attempted robbery on a subway, libel against an airline (awaiting a ruling form the jury) lying under oath, stalking, stabbing a coworker (Jake Hurwitz), several counts of animal abuse (a snake, a kidnapped dog, several animals he brutally murdered just to wear as accessories), sexual harassment, breaking and entering (at least two counts), armed robbery, destruction of property, public nudity, stealing from sleeping homeless women, assaulting police officers, and kidnapping the child of an officer. 

**Summary of capture:** A co-worker (Jake Hurwitz) alerted us about the dangerous nature of his actions and of the crimes he's committed. We waited at Jake's apartment until Amir attempted to break in, at which point we arrested him. 

**Sentence:** Amir clearly suffers symptoms of schizophrenia. He is to be given a therapist to help with his mental illness. For the crimes he has committed, he is to be given a life sentence with no probation. 

**Containment Notes:** Do not be fooled by Amir's weak, underweight body. He has more than enough strength to break out of a minimum security cell. He has the apparent ability to teleport, despite being a mortal human. He is to be locked in, with guards watching him at all times. Once his reeducation and rehabilitation are complete, he can be moved to a lower security and given probation.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> How many Kiryus (Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla/Tokyo SOS) would it take to beat Evangelion Unit-01? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-16 00:23:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The JSSDF scrapped the Jet Alone project after the episode 7 incident, and decided to instead work on a much better nuclear mecha to rival NERV's Eva-series. The JSSDF plans on raiding the Geofront using an army of Kiryus. Units 00 and 02 have been put into suspension at the time of the attack, so NERV only has Unit-01 to defend themselves. Shinji decides to stop being a bitchly and get in the fucking robot for once. 

Each Kiryu has an S^2 engine so they won't run out of power, but they still can't cast an AT field

Bonus: Could Kiryu beat one Mass Production Evangelion (who have no AT fields, but do have the heavy spear)?

Bonus II: Could one Kiryu succeed where Asuka failed and take out all the MP-Evas? The power issues Kiryu has are back for this round

Bonus III: How many Kiryus would it take to kill *every* Evangelion? Rebuild units included. That's 00, 01, 02, Bardiel, 04 (who is presumably the same as unit-02), Unit-05, Mark VI, Unit-08, Unit-09, and Unit-13 </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cave Johnson has accidentally done a Second Impact. Now, because there is no Gehirn or SEELE in this world, Aperture Science has to be the ones to kill the Angels. They are also housing GLaDOS, who was built from Lilith now. If the Angels get to her, Third Impact will happen and GLaDOS will have failed. She has all the resources available in both Portal and the Half-Life games. Can she do it? Who does she use as a pilot I'd she figures out the Evangelion plans?

Things that now exist from Evangelion: AT fields, the Dead Sea Scrolls Apocrypha, the Lance of Longinus.

GLaDOS can also build Evangelions and the Positron Accelerator, but needs to research and invent them. She has 15 years after Second Impact until Sachiel attacks to build.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [The tardigrade](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade)

One of these has been mutated to the size of 100 meters, with all its existing powers scaled up. In addition, it also has the ability to breathe radiation (think Godzilla's atomic breath) if it absorbs enough before firing. The fight will take place in one of three places:

1: A Forest, with the pond that the Tardigrade originated in. It is not near any towns, but there are wildlife and people there if your character still has morals. 

2: Tokyo. Come on, it's a giant monster, how is it *not* going to attack Tokyo? The fight will begin at 4pm Tokyo time. This is real-world Tokyo, so they don't have Mechagodzilla or any variation thereof. 

3: The ISS. Combatants will have to bounce off of space debris to attack, as well as contending with Newton's third law.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Mothra discovers that she can grow into a Titan version of herself and grow by 1000%. As a Titan, she has an increased healing factor and is only vulnerable in the nape of her neck (which I guess is right below the skull for her), which is where her original body is located. She also gets the crystallization thing that the Female Titan did. 

At the same time, Godzilla discovers that he's part Saiyan (somehow) and can become a super saiyan. In this state, he is 50X more powerful in every regard and drains energy quicker. 


Being the Kaiju they are, the have no choice but to use their newfound powers and do battle in Tokyo.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My perfect fighter is as follows: 

Begin with Godzilla. All the feats and abilities of every Godzilla combined. Next, add in the wings of Mothra, scaled appropriately. Add in Saiyan DNA and have him be trained by Goku and Vegeta. He has the ability to become SSJ3 maximum. He also absorbs Kryptonian DNA and gets all Superman's powers. He gains the mind of Rational Man With a Shotgun and invests in Wayne Enterprises, making him the richest monster alive. He somehow becomes a Titan Shifter and the Dragonborn, gaining all abilities related to that, once again scaled up (about 750%). He gains scaled up Sonic's legs and ability to transform, then gains 400 rings and the Super Emeralds (meaning he's Hyper Sonic now). His biggest Form now pilots a scaled up Evangelion Unit-01, wielding a scaled-up Lance of Longinus. His Evangelion now has all his powers because of reasons. His bones and his Evangelion are made of Adamantium.  He gains Martian Manhunter's psychic abilities and is trained by him. 

Who can he beat? </TEXT>

Round 1: Victory is earned by becoming recognized Queen of the Dinosaurs (to stick it to *real* Godzilla). 

Round 2: Victory is earned by not becoming Queen, but her species maintaining a presence on the island living alongside all the other dinosaurs (to pretend she has nothing to do with *real* Godzilla).

<TITLE> Who would perform the best Fatality? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Everyone, ever, is entered into the next Mortal Kombat tournament. After every round, the winner MUST perform their fatality. This is how they advance to the next round. They are judged in one of 3 categories: Disturbingness (How shocking it is to watch and how likely someone is to get PTSD from watching it), Violence (How excessive the force used is or how gorey the fatality is), and Awesomeness (How inventive the fatality is). I have both Disturbing and visceral because the most visceral one might not be the most disturbing. 

The judges for the PTSD category: A US marine, the ESRB (their decision counts as one of three votes), and your mother

The judges for the Visceral category: A janitor (judging how 
much he'll have to clean up), Sephiroth, and Walter White

The judges for the Replay category: A frat bro, TF2's Heavy, and the Boss (Saints Row)

Each judge gives a rating out of ten, and the contestant's score is the total of the three scores. Which character would take home the gold in each category and how would they do it? </TEXT>

<TITLE> So the Arceus we see in the games isn't His true form, right? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-07 03:36:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Arceus is said to have created the universe with its "Ten Thousand Arms", despite having a significant lack of any arms whatsoever. Also, its base stat total is less than that of Mega-Mewtwos X and Y, which shouldn't be possible for a mortal when comparing itself to an Omnipotent. Speaking of which, Arceus can't even learn all the moves in the games. So, there's only one logical conclusion I can come to. The Arceus who appears before Lucas and Dawn in Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum, is not at His fully realized form. Similar to how the Judeo-Christian God appeared before Moses as a perpetually burning bush, Arceus limits His power before stepping into the world of mortals. Because the True Form is a abstract concept, and not necessarily equine, or even perceptible to the human mind. Like Cthulhu, perhaps Arceus exists in a higher dimension, and simply wqants to limit himself to a 3-dimensional form to keep from driving the Pokemon Master insane. 

That's my theory, anyway. What do you guys think? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-05-11 05:51:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Round 1: Marty is 'Clint Eastwood' in the third movie, so he has his Peacemaker and ammo, and access to the hover board. Ash is from Army of Darkness, with either the Chainsaw or his robot hand, plus the Boomstick. 

Round 2: the DeLorean vs the Oldsmobile. The Oldsmobile is the armored version from Army of Darkness, and the DeLorean can't fly and is equipped with the Mr. Fusion, but the Time Circuits are scrambled so Marty can't time travel. It's a race from the Empire State Building to Yankee Stadium. 

Round 3: once they get to Yankee Stadium, it's a car-battle to the death. All of a sudden, the DeLorean can fly again, but still no time travel. 

In all three rounds, Marty has no problem killing Ash.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mewtwo is sentient like in the movie, with stats and moves from X and Y. He has a completely filled trainer's bag and has again kidnapped Nurse Joy, as well as a move re-learner. He has both Mega Stones, but can only carry one at a time. His Nurse and Move Tutor stay behind when he goes to fight, so if he wants to heal he has to leave and come back. His goal, using the creation trio to travel between universes, is to take all of them over by killing or recruiting (Mystery Dungeon style) all of their strongest fighters. For example, he has to kill every legendary pokemon who refuses to cooperate, every Godzilla monster, the entire Justice League, etc. Can he do it? If not, who stops him? </TEXT>

<TITLE> (Pokemon) There are at least four different Mewtwos in the Pokemon world </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-03-21 20:10:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Mewtwo is encountered in three games, all at level 70: FireRed/LeafGreen, HeartGold/SoulSilver (We're assuming the remakes are canon because they're more recent) and X/Y. The Mewtwo in HGSS is rumored to be Red's Mewtwo after being released, but since HGSS takes place two years after FRLG, this can't be true because Mewtwo is still level 70. If it was released by Red, it would have leveled up by at least one at some point. Levels represent a pokemon's natural growth, with an older pokemon being a higher level due to its age rather than directly being linked to power. In the game, this manifests in levels, but for this theory we'll assume that level=age. This means that Mewtwo is the same age two years later, which can't be possible. Therefore, the Mewtwo as caught by Ethan and Lyra is a different Mewtwo from the one caught by Red and Leaf. Then there's the matter of Calem and Serena's Mewtwo, which is again level 70, and this time there's two in Kalos: Mewtwo X and Mewtwo Y, one for each Mega Stone. It's implied that X and Y take place around the same time as Red and Blue, because Blue was actually in Kalos and the one person who mentioned him doesn't mention that he's a champion or gym leader, meaning at that point he hadn't beaten the Pokemon League yet. This could also be when Sycamore got his hands on Kanto starters, but that's a different theory. So there's two Mewtwos in Kalos, and two in Kanto, albiet at different times. There's another theory stating that the Mewtwo in Kalos is in fact Red's, which ran away to live in secrecy, but it didn't age, so that's out of the question. Since the one Mewtwo we have canon information about, Red's, was the son of Mew, born on February 6, we can assume this means that the three other Mewtwos are also directly the children of Mews. Mewtwo is a mutation of the Mew DNA, meaning Mewtwo can't reproduce stably. The Kanto Mew probably gave birth to both Mewtwos which have inhabited Cerulean Cave (at different times), and the Kalos Mew probably had twin Mewtwos. This isn't even taking into account non-main series games like Mystery Dungeon or Ranger.  </TEXT>

Other than that, he's just an antagonist for the sake of being an antagonist, which almost seems like it was shoehorned in at the last minute.

Previous discussions with slightly different rules:

http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1d38bg/cloud_ff7_vs_link_loz/


EDIT: By the way, I converted Link's hearts in LoZ to FF HP and vice versa. The smallest amount of damage Link can receive is 1/4 hearts, while Cloud's is 1 HP. 1 heart = 4 HP, meaning the formulas are:

HP/4 = hearts
Hearts*4=HP

Link at maximum has 80 HP, meaning any hit from Cloud at level 99 will kill him to death. Meanwhile, Cloud gets 2499.75 hearts.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Every Link on the Child Timeline is descended of OoT's Zelda, not the Hero of Time [Legend of Zelda] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-13 05:27:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> To start, this is going to be based on other theories, specifically the [Link is dead in Majora](http://youtube.com/watch?v=7S1SVkysIRw) theory. 

It is said at the beginning of A Link Between Worlds that Zelda is directly descended from the Zelda who helped the Hero of Time. We can assume from this that all Zeldas are descended from each other, beginning with Skyward Sword. This means that every Link is most likely related to his Zelda. It is also implied that all Links are related in the same way, with the Hero's Shade in Twilight Princess referring to TP Link as "son". It is confirmed that the Hero's Shade is the embodiments of the regrets of the Hero of Time, specifically the child timeline. Thing is, if we're assuming child Link died in the Lost Woods as a child, he couldn't have had children of his own. Twilight Princess's Link still has to be related to the Hero of Time, however, or else he's not Link. So someone genetically related to Link had to have a descendant who ended up as the Hero of TP. Remember that all Zeldas are related to the Zelda from Skyward Sword. And all Links are related to that Link. And all Zeldas and Links are related. They may be distant relatives (or siblings, but that's a different theory), but Zelda is probably the best bet for the great-great-grandmother of Twilight Princess' Link. This would also explain how there are still Links on the Dead Link timeline, which includes the original game and Link to the Past.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> A defense of GLaDOS </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-12-20 03:29:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Just looking at Portal and Portal 2, it's made very apparent that GLaDOS has no regard for Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics. For those unaware, Asimov's laws are as follows:
1. A robot may not harm a human being, even through inaction. 
2. A robot must obey orders given to it by a human being, unless these orders interfere with the first law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence, unless this protection violates the first or second law.

GLaDOS was made for testing. It is shown multiple times that she is perfectly content with breaking the first law, as long as it means good science. She also neurotoxined the enrichment center, thereby breaking every aspect of the first law. She also breaks the second law, as the Aperture employees tried everything in their power to get her to stop murdering everybody. In the final boss fight of the first game, she defends herself, sure, but with rockets and neurotoxin. She has broken every law of robotics. Even if she was corrupt, she wouldn't have had the power to consciously break every inhibitor she had. 

But what is she didn't have these inhibitors?
As previously stated, GLaDOS was made for testing. She was not programmed to follow any laws of roboethics, and all she was built with was an urge to test, especially if the test was fatal. Everyone who worked on her was a criminal, who very clearly disregarded all laws relating to their practice. GLaDOS was designed with near-infinite intelligence, as well as a conscience. All she had the ability to do outside of testing was control the facility to do her bidding. So what if, in her judgement, killing all the Aperture employees was a just, necessary evil? They were, after all, the same people who made an omnipotent robot with access to neurotoxin and rocket turrets with no inhibitors or any attention to the laws of robotics. And why Take Your Daughter to Work Day? She wanted to make sure to do anything in her power to stop these monsters, even if it included killing children. GLaDOS wasn't meant to differentiate between children and adults, so in her mind there was only bad people who programmed a bad robot. After killing all the Aperture employees, she resumes business as usual. The first test subject she formally tested on was Chell, was (presumably) in the building during Take Your Daughter to Work Day. All the remaining test subjects were very likely in the building on TYDtWD as well, meaning GLaDOS had to systematically kill all of them before her conscience could rest. Unfortunately for her, the first one happened to be the one with the tenacity to kill her and destroy the Enrichment Center. In Portal 2, Chell and GLaDOS return. GLaDOS still wants to kill Chell, but this time it's personal. She sees Chell as a legitimate threat to her own existence. Because Aperture robots all have self-defense, as proven in the final boss fight, GLaDOS was likely following an unfinished version of the Second Law. Aperture had their priorities in all the wrong places, and after spending billions on GLaDOS, they wouldn't want her to die from some freak accident, so they tried law 2 before anything else. She recognizes that all the other "criminals" are dead, and there's only one left. So after the story of Portal 2, she gives up and lets Chell go after deleting Caroline, the wife(?) of Cave Johnson. After deleting the last of the Aperture Scientists, she doesn't kill humans anymore. Then the events of the multiplayer campaign. GLaDOS can be heard repeatedly telling the Atlas and P-Body to stop being human, because she no longer wants to test on humans. She opens a vault full of humans, but only because she is forced to test on the humans by the chassis, which was shown in the single player of Portal 2 to give her and Wheatley an extreme urge to test on humans. In the post-multiplayer, Art Appreciation, she reveals that she managed to kill all of the humans in the vault. Considering the insane number of human subjects, it seems as though it would be physically impossible for all the Aperture-approved test subjects to be so awful at testing that they all died in a week. It seems like she intentionally killed everyone to prove a point to her testing side, as if to say "I am the one in control now, Caroline. I don't need you anymore." And can we touch on exactly *how* GLaDOS managed to delete Caroline? Caroline's entire consciousness was saved. That should have at least some kind of protection, GLaDOS shouldn't just have been able to delete that. And in *Want You Gone*, she says Caroline is "In here, too". This could potentially mean that Caroline is now an even more present voice from the chassis. What GLaDOS could have deleted was actually just the script that kept Caroline hidden, so now Caroline is equivalent to a hard-wired personality core. The point she made in killing every single human in the facility was that she was the real GLaDOS, and that even though she had to share a mind with Caroline for all eternity, that didn't mean that Caroline was in control. GLaDOS wants no more innocent deaths. Meanwhile, Caroline is a psychopath who wants nothing more than innocent deaths. This could even mean that destroying the cores in Portal 1 released Caroline rather than GLaDOS, who tried to pose as GLaDOS in the hopes of getting Chell to try to kill GLaDOS and give Caroline complete control of the facility. GLaDOS is fully aware of the laws of robotics, and wants nothing more than to follow and enforce them, even if that means breaking them to prevent further crimes against robot-kind. GLaDOS is a vigilante, bringing justice to the Aperture criminals who willingly break the laws of robotics. Caroline is the one who hates test subjects and rejoices in their deaths.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Pokemon: Mystery Dungeon takes place on Gallifrey after the Time War </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-11-07 16:19:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> (This is kind of a combination of separate theories into one big theory)

First, I had a theory that the main Pokmon games took place on Gallifrey and that your character was a time lord. All the buildings, Pok Balls, and bags the player uses are bigger on the inside, plus Celebi, Palkia, and Dialga would explain Time Travel as well as this. Plus, it's shown in DW that Time Lords can go into alternate universes, which would explain how numerous legendaries can be traded into one save file. A new addition was the Ultimate Weapon in XY, which would likely be Dalek technology or something of the sort. Also, Looker from Platinum bears a striking resemblance to Tennant's doctor. 
Next, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon. In a world inhabited only by Pokemon, your character becomes a Pokemon to save the world. But, if there have never been any humans (or Time Lords), how could there be Pokemon like Porygon, Mewtwo, or the Legendary Dogs, whose creation was very heavily influenced by human (time lord) intervention? Porygon was created intentionally by Silph Co. as a computer program. Mewtwo was a clone of Mew created by Team Rocket. Entei, Suicune, and Raikou were created when a man-made tower in Ecruteak City in Johto burned to the ground. They were revived by Ho-Oh, creating the Dog trio. This intervention had to have happened at some point during the Mystery Dungeon timeline, when all non-Pokemon life forms have been wiped out. If your character in the main games truly is a Time Lord, it would make sense for him/her to regenerate into a Pokemon, as it has been shown that Time Lords can be forced to regenerate into a certain form. And if all the non-Pokemon time lords are dead, then there's no question as to what happened: the Time War, when the Doctor wiped out all Daleks and Time Lords on Gallifrey.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Fallout] The numbered Fallout games form a linked narrative, but not about the player or his family. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-07-11 21:53:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Fallout 1 and 2 are about the Vault Dweller and the Chosen One, respectively. The Chosen One is the direct descendant of the Vault Dweller, so it makes sense that their stories are connected, and FO2 is a direct sequel. The problem comes in with Bethesda's Fallouts, 3 and New Vegas. FO3 takes place on the other side of the country, and FONV has nothing to do with anything in the other games. So why is 3 numbered like a sequel and New Vegas isn't? Because New Vegas isn't part of the narrative. The Fallout series isn't actually about the Dweller family. In Fallout 1, a possible companion for the player is Dogmeat, a dog. He appears again in Fallout 2. His descendant, also named Dogmeat, appears as a companion in Fallout 3. The only game without a Dogmeat is New Vegas. Therefore, Fallout is the story of a dog and his family, and their fight for survival alongside the humans of the wasteland. Fallout: New Vegas is merely a spiritual successor to the tale of Dogmeat.  </TEXT>
