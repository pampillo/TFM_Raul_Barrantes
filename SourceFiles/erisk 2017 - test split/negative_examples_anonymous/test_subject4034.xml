<TITLE> Help fixing or recovering data from an External Hard Drive </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-08 06:57:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am using a 1Tb WD Passport external hard drive and my OS is windows 7 64bit.
My hd will be registered by the computer, i will be able to safely remove ect.
However in Windows Explorer the device will show up but not under its proper name and as soon as I click on it Windows Explorer crashes. When i open the computer management tool and click on disk management it freezes until I pull the hard drive then everything works perfectly again. Same with disk defragmenter.
Is there a way I can fix this hard drive without reformatting it or a way I can recover the 500Gb of data off it and then reformat or throw the friggin thing away?

Any help is greatly appreciated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't removed it from the enclosure but I did swap the connector. The issue is that the computer registers that the drive has been plugged into it, I can safely remove hardware ect, but windows explorer cannot open the drive nor can I use any of the data. So I figured a reformat is in order however there is a solid 600Gb of content that I really dont want to lose.

Cheers for the suggestion however I might give them a look. </TEXT>
