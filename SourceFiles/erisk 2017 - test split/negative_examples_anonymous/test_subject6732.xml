<TEXT> I finished the book at around 2 AM and today is also my birthday.

Starting with the idea of having a dog as the narrator to the way it sees the mankind, their relationships, their emotions and its own, their lifestyle, the satire, its persona... all these have hit the chord and the book has filled great many places in my heart. I recommend the book to anybody who love to read something sensible about life from time to time.

**EDIT:** Ok. That was a small math mistake of mine. It was my 17th birthday. I guess I was too excited about my 18th birthday that I added year to the actual 17th. Sorry, my bad :)

<TEXT> I would recommend people to read atleast one book about nature and environment each year.  I strongly believe that we should pay attention to the planet's grave perils such as climate change and global warming which are being caused because of us. These problems deserve to be known.

*Walden* by Henry David Thoreau would give you a kick-ass start.. and then there is lot of non-ficiton about the subject. Am currently reading *The Sixth Extinction* by Elizabeth Kolbert. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just take one day off from your daily fapping routine and keep yourself off from all the usual thoughts. Do whatever is possible to keep yourself busy and productive for that one day. Meditate. Read. Dance. Sing. Roam. Eat. Paint.. do anything but masturbation, or even spend the whole day dreaming and imagining yourself as the person you want to be in life. Live one day like that. And see if you like it. Ask yourself if you want to experience more of such days... and you know what, you already have the answer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From:

 I used to fap like twice a day and incest was the only thing which gave me the pleasure.

to:

 Now, after reaching nofap, I fap like once in a week or so and I am in total control of it.

That's quite a good change. Many people here might disagree with your new fapping routine, but I completely agree. After all, the purpose of NoFap community is not just helping people get over their fapping addictions, but also helping them do it in a way that they think is best for them. So, you're fine there.

Even I, before I knew of NoFap, used to take long gaps from masturbation whenever I got bored or lost flavour in M sessions. The rarity of the event itself makes it much more enjoyable for me. The titillations that I get, now and then, when I keep myself away from M for a long while, like more than 10 days or so is very pleasurable. And when I do it after such desire and titillation filled arousal, oh it simply is an inexplicable feeling.

<TEXT>  I can tell you biweekly relapses (once every two weeks) aren't the most effective way in tackling NoFap.

Looking at what the OP said in the post, I don't think he is *relapsing*. He is quite clear that he took up NoFap by deciding to fap once in 10 to 20 days, so I think his new fapping schedule need not be counted as relapse. I belive that relapse to this OP means fapping again like he used to do before, very frequently and only to those incest fantasies during all those times. </TEXT>

I mean, having a girlfriend and having sex with her before marriage is not a norm here, moreover it is seen as a very indecent thing in most of the households. So, unable to have actual sexual experiences at regular intervals, we tend towards porn. So, if we take up NoFap, it almost always ends up as a Hardmode. </TEXT>

**A Breathtaking Sight**

I stood there enchanted

under the umbrella of cosmic light

and witnessed a spectacle undaunted

that showcased the beauty's magic and might.


*"What is it, that sharp light?"*

I asked myself, with a wondering heart

A voice spoke to me from that very sight

and the heavens answered, *" 'tis our master's everlasting art."*

<TEXT> HI BROTHERS.. LONG TIME. HOW ARE Y'ALL??

IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS I'VE BEEN PRETTY FUCKED UP IN MY HEAD. LOT OF OVERWHELMING EXPERIENCES IN MY DAILY LIFE. SOME DEPRESSING AND SOME ENCOURGAING. BUT MOST OF THEM HAVE ENDED UP WINNING IN MAKING ME FEEL LOW EVERY MORNING. 

I DIDN'T LIKE THAT. I'M SCORNING THE FUCKING FEELING OF WAKING UP TO THE MISERABLE THOUGHTS ON LIFE AT EVERY SUNRISE. 

I WANT TO THE CHANGE THE FUCK OUT OF IT. I WANT TO CONCENTRATE MY MIND ON THE INTERESTING ASPECTS OF MY LIFE RATHER THAN ON THE GLOOMY ONES. SO I DECIDED TO LIST OUT WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT MAKE MY LIFE INTERESTING AND NON-INTERESTING AND THEN SHIFT MY FOCUS ON TO THE GOOD ONES.
 SO HERE IT GOES -

**INTERESTING ONES:**

* READING BOOKS (I LOVE THIS. BUT I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO LOVE THIS SOME MORE)
* READING NON-FICTION BOOKS AND WRITING THEIR SUMMARIES TO BETTER REMEMBER THE STUFF LEARNED (THIS IS A NEW THING I JUST TOOK UP)
* STUDYING MATH  (I WON'T TALK ABOUT THAT)
* WRITING FICTION AND POETRY (THIS IS THE PUREST BLISS OF MY LIFE)
* NOFAP CHALLENGE (NOT AN ADDICT THOUGH, BUT WANTED TO TEST MY MIND'S CONTROL LEVELS AGAIN - LAST TIME DID 131 DAYS IN HARD MODE)
* TRYING TO IMPROVE MY PUBLIC SPEAKING SKILL (THIS IS VITAL FOR SOMETHING I PLANNED FOR MY FUTURE)
* WRITING INFORMAL LOG ENTRIES FOR EACH DAY (INSPIRED FROM THE NOVEL [*THE MARTIAN*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_%28Weir_novel%29) BY ANDY WEIR)
* STUDYING/RESEARCHING ABOUT ENVIRONMENTALISM (CURRENTLY READING A BOOK: [*THE SIXTH EXTINCTION*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sixth_Extinction_%28book%29) BY ELIZABETH KOLBERT, WILL SOON PICK UP A BOOK ON *GLOBAL WARMING* - **BECAUSE FUCK GLOBAL WARMING**)
* ALGORITHMS, MAN. I NEED TO STUDY SOME REALLY IMPORTANT ALGORITHMS IN MACHINE LEARNING AND DATA ANALYTICS

**NON-INTERESTING ONES** (THINGS I'M NOT LIKING IN MYSELF):

* BEHAVING SOMETIMES LIKE A GODDAMN LOSER 
* NOT STICKING TO MY DETERMINED CHANGES IN LIFESTYLE
* **PROCRASTINATION** (MAN THIS IS FUCKING SHIT. THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN FUCKING UP MY LIFE)
* FEARING TO STUDY MATH (YEAH)
* NOT READING MORE NUMBER OF BOOKS (I NEED TO READ MORE, MANY MORE, MANY MANY FUCKING MORE BOOKS IN MY LIFE - *BECAUSE I'M AN ASPIRING WRITER, YO!*)


SO BROTHERS THAT'S ABOUT MY LIFE RIGHT NOW. YOU GUYS TOO PLEASE SHARE YOUR LIFE HERE. **I'M SURE WE CAN INSPIRE ONE ANOTHER. AFTER ALL, WHY ELSE ARE WE HERE ANYWAYS!** </TEXT>

<TEXT> Change the names. Otherwise the book becomes too much alive for those people and, in the long run, to you too. You're still very young, so let's say you've written a memoir using the original names of those people, and later in your life, due to some obvious and unfortunate reasons if the relationship between you and any of those people becomes a bit shaky, then the book might start to carry a lot of different and disappointing aura and meaning around it: when you read those lines again using the original names, and when you know the reality behind it has changed away forever, you will start feeling the void in your own words.  So, it is highly advisable to change the names. This would atleast leave a version of reality untouched forever in the form of the book.

Why I'm telling this is because of a minor personal experience I went through. I had once written something very nice for a person, and at the time the work meant a great deal to me, but later when I faced some opinion mismatches with the person, the kind of sense I had towards my words in that work changed. It started to act as an eternal reminder of what was not. I didn't like it. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Non-fiction books are something of a knowledge repository. Currently I'm reading *The Sixth Extinction* by Elizabeth Kolbert. The book is quite interesting and has some really great things told about some of the species that have gone extinct, the causes behind those extinctions and other such vital data was discussed. 

After reading three chapters into the book, I realized that I'm not able to remember every little detail about the things explained in the book since its beginning. So, I decided to write chapter wise summaries in a Word document. 

I would just like to know about how do you guys keep track of the things that a book teaches you? Once time passes by humans tend to forget a lot of stuff, so how do we take care of such data loss from our minds, data that we collected by doing the hard work of reading many great books?

It's not particularly technical at all. I would say somewhere around 1 on the scale of 5. The book has won Pulitzer Prize for Best Non-Fiction, so it is assumed that the book was written for the general lay public, like you and me. Do try picking it up, it's quite a interesting and worthy read. </TEXT>

And the first thing I ever read that's written by Neil Gaiman, and which in turn made me fall in love with him, was [this writing advice post on his Tumblr.](http://neil-gaiman.tumblr.com/post/107713982316/i-have-been-trying-to-write-for-a-while-now-i) That's just a pure and fantastic genius of a mind he is.

<TEXT> **The Sixth Extinction, by Elizabeth Kolbert**

I picked it up after seeing it recommended by Bill Gates on his [gatesnotes](http://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/The-Sixth-Extinction) blog. Also, recently, moved by hundreds of deaths that are caused due to the overheat in my country's (India) climate, I've taken up an interest in studying the perils humans are causing to the environment. This book is quite interesting and captivating in talking of the extinctions that happend in the evolution of the Earth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like I mentioned, last year I took up the challenge and lasted 131 days. I'm taking it up again now - not because I'm a PMO addict (I'm not. I believe I'm not an addict because I fap only like once of twice a week) - but because I want to wake up my mind from rest and laziness and put it to the test of productiveness.

(Also, I love those erections that I get after not fapping for a long while... those tempting titillations are sometimes better than having an orgasm - and such *long while*s are possible only through NoFap challenge.)

<TITLE> Yesterday I watched the revealing documenraty 'Going Clear' about The Church of Scientology. What do you guys think of L.Ron Hubbard, that a writer had founded such a cult that made some people ecstatic while immensely troubling others? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-06 06:28:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I didn't know that the founder of Church of Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard held a Guinness Record for the number of books he wrote (more than a 1000 books). In the documentary Going Clear, they've told about how he tortured his wife and the kind of financial views with which started the new religion of Scientology, and also his stature, arrogance and demeanour while giving interviews or while on the ship with other members of the church and many, many other such instances repelled me very badly. 

I wasn't least bit impressed that he was a prolific writer of so many books because of how the Church of Scientology turned out in the lives of a large number of its past members, who were physically and psychologically abused to great degrees, and  tortured by punishments such as licking the bathrooms with their tongue, throwing a person on the floor and kicking him cruelly in the name of teaching lessons for their wrong doings against the teachings of the church... and also how they tell the members to completely disconnect from their family members who do not believe in the church... all of this has just gave me a very negative opinion on LRH and his church of scientology.

What do you guys think about this entire concept and how the church of scientology treats people who seem to be future threats to the church's reputation?

Watch this Hindi film from Bollywood [Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1562872/) which means *Life Doesn't Happen Twice.* It has some great pure bits of poetry on some really inconceivable things in life..

* Flash fiction helps me in sharpening the skill of developing an engaging fictional pieces.
*  Short stories challenge me to shape a story that has the main elements of storytelling, such as conflict, purpose, character and etc.
* Quotes help me to understand myself better. They act as self-advices.

<TITLE> Last Saturday, I read 'The Pearl' by John Steinbeck. I realized that I prefer short novels of Nobel Laureates. </TITLE>

<TEXT> Ever since I read Gitanjali by Tagore I understood the potential of writers who win Nobels in Literature. So, from then on every now and then I pick up something written by Nobel laureates. As of now I've read:

* Tagore (Gitanjali)
* Herman Hesse (Siddhartha; Steppenwolf)
* Ernst Hemingway (The Old Man and the Sea)
* John Steinbeck (Of Mice and Men; The Pearl)

I realized that I prefer short novels of such people which gives a glimpse of the kind of work they do and the type of stories they tell. 

From the above list, only Ernest Hemingway's book *The Old Man and the Sea* bored me badly (sorry, fans). Rest of them were somewhere between good to great reads. 

What are your favourite (preferrably short) works from Nobel winners in literature? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Probably off topic, but I want to ask suggestions from you guys about 'storytelling' in the literal sense. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-24 07:37:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm an aspiring writer. And I also want to develop my storytelling skills. By 'storytelling' I mean actually telling them, not just in text but in voice, by speaking it out, by narrating it. 

I'm sure many of you guys are not only great writers of stories but also engaging tellers of those stories. I sincerely believe that there is a fine bit of difference between writing a story and telling it out for others. The biggest difference that I can argue about is that a written story is usually for people who read, and there are many, many people around the world who don't read (novels and such) but I'm sure no one is possibly averse to listening to a great story that's being told to them. (I also think this is a reason that makes movies differ from books, in a way.)

Please help me by giving some suggestions on:

* how to develop this skill 
* what kind of story suits better to be told than to write (if)
* what body language affects people in storytelling process
* how to engage your audience better when you're telling them a story

and anything else that you think would be important for a good story teller.

I'm really counting on this as it's very important for what I'm trying to do.

Thank you so much, guys. You're awesome :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'M 25 AND VERY AMBITIOUS AND ASPIRING. BUT THE THINGS THAT I'M DOING IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW ARE NOT IN FUCKING UNISON WITH ANYTHING. THAT'S THE BIGGEST MOTHERFUCKING PROBLEM I'M FACING RIGHT NOW. I'M FIGHTING WITH MYSELF. I MUST. 

I WASTE A HELL LOT OF FUCKING TIME BY GETTING LOST IN A BUZZ OF THOUGHTS IN MY MIND THAT KEEPS MY FROM WORKING TOWARDS MY LIFE'S CONCERNS. I REALIZED THAT IT IS MY FUCKING PROBLEM. THE BUZZ. I SHOULD CONTROL IT. FUCKING TIE IT DOWN BY ITS NECK AND HANG IT TO DEATH. SO THAT IT WON'T TROUBLE ME IN ACHIEVING MY CONCERNS.

I HAVE THE FOLLOWING CONCERNS FOR MY BEAUTIFUL LIFE. THESE ARE ALL THE THINGS THAT MY HEART ALWAYS WANTS, AND THAT DIRECTLY AFFECT MY LIFE. I WANT TO DEDICATE THE NEXT FEW YEARS OF MY LIFE COMPLETELY TO THESE THINGS BY ABANDONING EVERYTHING ELSE THAT IS PETTY.

* **MBA ENTRANCE EXAM**- AIMING FOR SOME PREMIER INSTITUTES
* **JOB** - TO DO WELL IN THE CURRENT ONE AND LEARN GOOD DEAL OF SKILLS
* **READING BOOKS** - I NEED THIS BECAUSE I'M AN ASPIRING WRITER
* **WRITING** - OH THIS IS AFTER ALL MY LIFE'S WHOLE POINT AND PURPOSE. I GOTTA WRITE. FICTION. NON-FICTION. POETRY. SHORT STORIES. I JUST WANT TO WANDER AND FLY AND DIVE IN THE WORLD OF WORDS.

WHAT ARE YOUR CONCERNS IN LIFE, BROTHERS, AND WHAT IS IT THAT'S STOPPING YOU IN THE JOURNEY? LET'S TALK TO ONE ANOTHER ABOUT THEM. </TEXT>

<TITLE> LAST WEEKEND HAD BEEN A FUCKING DISAPPOINTMENT </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-17 16:55:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I WOKE UP EARLY MORNING AT 5AM AND STUDIED FOR A LITTLE WHILE. ONLY FOR A FUCKING LITTLE WHILE. AND THEN AT 7AM I HAD TO TAKE AN ONLINE MOCKTEST FOR AN EXAM I'M PREPARING. THE TEST WAS OF NEARLY 3 HOURS. I REALLY FELT THAT I PERFORMED WELL IN ONE SECTION OF THE TEST. SO, I WAS LOOKING FORWARD FOR THE RESULTS. BUT WHEN I SUBMITTED MY TEST, THE GODDAMN SERVER FAILED. IT FUCKING FAILED. AND LIKE THAT BEGAN MY ONE OF THE MOST DISAPPOINTING WEEKENDS IN THE RECENT TIMES.

AT 12PM I WENT TO THE COACHING CLASSES THAT I ENROLLED INTO FOR THE EXAM PREP. AND SLOWLY AFTER A COUPLE OF HOURS OF CLASS I STARTED FEELING SLEEPY (BECAUSE I WASN'T HAVING ENOUGH SLEEP OVER THE WEEK DUE TO WORK AND STUFF LIKE THAT). AFTER 2PM A NEW CLASS HAS STARTED WHERE AN IMPORTANT MATH TOPIC WAS GOING ON 'PERMUTATIONS   COMBINATIONS.' AND I WAS HARDLY ABLE TO KEEP MY EYES OPEN DUE TO THE GODDAMN DROWSINESS. BY TRYING TO KEEP MYSELF FROM SLEEP IN THE CLASS, I STARTED TO GET HEADACHE. AND LIKE THAT I LOST THE ENTIRE LECTURE AND I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING.

FIRST THE TEST'S SERVER PROBLEM WHICH LOST ME MY PERFORMANCE CHECK. AND THEN BEING A SLEEPYFUCKINGHEAD PISSED ME OFF SO MUCH.

ALSO RECENTLY MANY THINGS IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW ARE GOING BAD. MOSTLY THIS EXAM THING. MAN, I'M SO NOT DOING JUSTICE TO IT. </TEXT>

<TITLE> What are the best ways to write beautiful freeverse poetry? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-04 13:50:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm an aspiring novelist. But sometimes I just can't overlook the beauty of language that is presented in freeverse poetic pieces. I recently read Mary Oliver's *House of Light* and rejoiced a great deal of wordly beauty that those pages presented. And Tagore's *Gitanjali* is my all time favourite.

I too write some freeverse now and then, and also I was told by a few friendds of mine that I write short poetic stuff better than I write the regular blogs.

And also on Tumblr I sometimes witness beautiful stuff written by random people around the world. A recent one that I found and became a fan of is Jamie Oliveira. Her [cosmicroots](http://cosmicroots.tumblr.com) blog was splendid. Some of her works were simply sour stirring for me.

Experiencing all this beauty of language and words in shortly woven pieces, these days I'm tending to try out freeverse writing myself. 

What do you think are some of the ways in which I can improve my freeverse writing? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I picked up his short stories collection volume 1. Just finished the first story *The Landlady* and it ended abruptly when Weaver was trying to remember somthing about the two names listed in the guest book of the hotel. And why did landlady tried to interrupt him when he was trying to remember how he found those two names familiar??

I'm an aspiring author, so it is important for me to understand what I'm reading in depth. 

What was Roald Dahl trying to say in the story?

<TEXT> Just now I finished Mary Oliver's poetry (free verse) book, *House of Light*. It was a very pleasing read. It has some great touching lines:

*"There are many stories, more beautiful than answers."*

*"She does not work slowly, nor quickly, like a river."*

*"Its not size but surge that tells us when were in touch with something real."*

*"If the world were only pain and logic, who would want it?"*

*"Fear has not yet occurred to them, nor ambition."*

and my most favourite:

*"This is not a poem about a dream, though it could be.*

*This is a poem about the world that is ours, or could be."*


and many many more...

Now, I'm thinking of picking of Shelley's poetry soon. I just broswed a book or two of his and they appeared to be very promising free verses.

What are your favourite free verse poetry books?? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Harry Potter. Those 7 books are at the core of my heart and the way my morality in life is shaped. What else is so important for a person than his morale! Albus Dumbledore has taught me to always be humble no matter how powerful you become, and Harry taught me it is good to stay down to earth even if you're the most important person to many. Hagrid had taught me trust. The trio themselves had taught me the value of friendship... And above all, the Harry Potter series by J.K.Rowling has showed me that life can be magical and illuminating if one only remember to turn on the light. I'm indebted forever to Rowling. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah seriously.. That 'book inside a book' thing... it was literally the most dragging part of the entire thing.

At the beginning of the novel when the concepts such as *Thought Police* were being narrated, it was really interesting. And 1984 being a famous sci-fi novel (which it is goddamn definitely not), I was expecting something of a Hollywood level plot twist.. and then facepalm :/ </TEXT>

 I mean, no offense. It's popular for a reason. I just couldn't stand it. I feel like dystopian is just too overplayed now and I've seen it all before.

I'd love to accomplish such a thing.

Dude that's a nailing sentence.

 Could this all be a placebo?

No. It's will power, brother.

<TEXT> The collection contains short poetic/prose pieces.. I'm an aspiring writer, and sometimes I pen my heartfelt words on Tumblr and other social media. I've collected some of them that I've written recently, around some 25 short works.

Art is something that intrgues me with its grandeur. It makes me think better and feel more lively when I do my writing. So, I would love to see my writings blended with beautiful illustrations.

<TEXT> I have something for you. I too am still a guy who can not understand poetry well.. I needed English prose translation of epic poetry (such as Paradise Lost) that was already written in English. I'm that bad.. (also English is not my native, I'm from India) But here is the catch: Poetry, when felt and enjoyed, tastes as good as honey.. I'm not kidding. I don't understand most poetry and yet I keep reading it now and then, for it has some jewels written in its sentences, sentences that standout as quotes.. I read poetry especially to dig out such sentences even if I don't understand what is going on in the entire poem. I do this because I am not prepared to miss the sentences like: 

*"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,that is all Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know."*
just because I don't understand poetry (by the way the above are the closing lines from John Keats' *Ode on a Grecian Urn.*)


But I also mostly enjoy Edgar Allan Poe's poetry very well.. I fell in love with poetry itself only when I read Poe's short poetry, primarily, *Eldorado.*



**Eldorado**

Gaily bedight, 

A gallant knight,

In sunshine and in shadow,

Had journeyed long,

Singing a song,

In search of Eldorado.




But he grew old-

This knight so bold-

And o'er his heart a shadow

Fell as he found

No spot of ground

That looked like Eldorado.




And, as his strength

Failed him at length,

He met a pilgrim shadow-

"Shadow," said he,

"Where can it be-

This land of Eldorado?"




"Over the Mountains

Of the Moon,

Down the Valley of the Shadow,

Ride, boldly ride,"

The shade replied-

"If you seek for Eldorado!"







And another poem by Edgar Allan Poe has the following lines, which is what interested me to look into Poe in the first place:




*All that we see or seem*

*Is but a dream within a dream.*



And I prefer short poetry over long ones.. *Mary Olivers* is a new poet that I'm planning to look into soon this year. </TEXT>

 Harry never had that. He had to handle his own monsters. And Voldemort is no different.

<DATE> 2015-05-04 14:29:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I often wonder how writers use typewriters, which doesn't offer the features of deleting something and retyping it, or clearing off a printed sentence or editing it.. much like a computer keyboard does. To do any of these on an actual typewriter, it would waste lot of paper, right? So, how do writers manage to use them instead of a keyboard or a word document where they don't have to waste an entire paper for every typo or a change in words or sentences they decide to make?? 

But I want to get the feel of a typewriter and see what's there.. Is there any software that combines the feel of a typewriter alongside providing the features of a keyboard? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Picked up Mark Twain's 'The Prince and the Pauper' with lot of hope and interest. But let down by its narration in archaic English. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-04 08:13:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I had always liked the concept of this book where the two look alikes from distinct lifestyles swap their appearances and unfortunately it stretches too far and brings in bigger changes in their lives than they've asked for.. I wanted to read the book and so picked it up last month. But to my surprise I discovered that all the characters in the book are speaking archaic English langauge. 

So the book is seeming very tough and an extrememly slow read, and it's tough to concentrate on the plot. Because of all this my excitement for the book is dwindling.

I really wish *The Prince and the Pauper* was written in normal/modern English :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you look at *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* there is something called as Time Turner which is used by Hermione to attend extra classes, it is also the object which Dumbledore advices Harry to use by the end of the book to travel back in time and set things right.. There is not any explanation given as to the working of time turner itself but the story just carries on with its help and presence. So, maybe you can simply come up with something like that and take your story forward.. And also there is a book by Stephen King called *11/22/63* where a teacher travels back in time to stop the assassination of JFK.. I haven't read it yet but you might wanna check that out once.. And most important of all is not what you used to time travel, but how well the plot is woven.. If the story is griping enough, then audience wouldn't care about how it's done.. Didn't you watch Chris Nolan's *Inception* film.. Nobody bothers about what that dream machine was all about but what they do there after entering into the dream realm... So, it depends not on what your character uses to time travel but what he does after time traveling that would interest some category of people, a category that readers like me belong to.

(I'm saving this post.. I would love to see others people's views on your question.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah... and moreover the chemistry that a boyfriend and girlfriend should be having between them is completely missing between Harry and Hermione... They're just like any usual great male and female friends.. but such a chemistry was always there between Ron and Hermione. They just have it... I think this whole thing of Hermione and Harry came up just because Emma Watson is extremely beautiful and that we all have a knack for pairing up the best looking girl only with the main protagonist of a story and not with his best friend. </TEXT>

<TEXT> THE SURE SHOT WAY TO HAVE A COMPLETENESS IN YOUR EVERYDAY LIFE IS TO ALWAYS FUCKING DO SOMETHING.. EVERY SINGLE MOMENT. DONT SIT IDLE FOR MORE THAN 300 SECONDS AT A STRETCH. ALWAYS KEEP DOING SOMETHING. BE IT READING SOMETHING OR REMEMBERING A MATH TRICK YOU LEARNED A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO OR ANYTHING PRODUCTIVE FOR THAT MATTER.. BUT ALWAYS DO SOMETHING THAT TAKES YOU A STEP FORWARD ON YOUR DREAM PATH. IF NOTHING ELSE TURNS UP IN YOUR MIND, JUST SIT AND LISTEN TO YOUR BREATH... MEDITATE.

REALIZING YOUR POTENTIAL BY EXHAUSTING YOURSELF LIKE FUCK BY DOING THE STUFF THAT IS NECESSARY FOR YOU IN THE PURSUIT OF YOUR GODDAMN DREAM.. THAT IS WHAT IT MEANS TO BE FUCKING ALIVE. 

REMEMBER THIS EVERY GODDAMN MOMENT THAT YOU FEEL YOURE WASTING TIME. WHEN WE DO THIS WE CAN SLEEP PEACEFULLY. LET ME TELL YOU BROTHERS, A PEACEFUL SLEEP IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS SEEN MUCH IN PEOPLE, RICH AND POOR ALIKE. TO SLEEP PEACEFULLY WITH A HAPPY MIND IS ONE OF THE BEST FUCKING THINGS IN LIFE. 

NOW, LET'S GO EXHAUST OURSELVES BY THE END OF EACH DAY AND SEE FOR OURSELVES WHAT A GREAT RELAXING SLEEP WE WILL HAVE EVERY NIGHT.

I agree with the full quote, however it is not particularly necessary to read only those books that make you grieve.. It might be the case that you're already grieving about something in life and you want a book that casts upon your mind a new light of hope and euphoria. You need books that not only affect you like disaster, but also those that come to you with the relief aids and life support supplies.. for life is not just about loss but more importantly about loving and living. </TEXT>

<TEXT> These are the closing lines of The Martian:

The cost for my survival must have been hundreds of millions of dollars. All to save one dorky botanist. Why bother? 

Well, okay. I know the answer to that. Part of it might be what I represent: progress, science, and the interplanetary future weve dreamed of for centuries. But really, they did it because every human being has a basic instinct to help each other out. It might not seem that way sometimes, but its true. 

If a hiker gets lost in the mountains, people will coordinate a search. If a train crashes, people will line up to give blood. If an earthquake levels a city, people all over the world will send emergency supplies. This is so fundamentally human that its found in every culture without exception. Yes, there are assholes who just dont care, but theyre massively outnumbered by the people who do. And because of that, I had billions of people on my side. </TEXT>

I recently purchased his second autobiography *I, Asimov.* Looking forward to an amazing journey into Asimov's life and mind, yet again.

Do you guys also have any authors that you love to read when they write about themselves and their life?? </TEXT>

<TEXT> hey this one is very good too.. thank you so much.. 

(But I was surprised that in all the three pics I got from people the girl is moving objects vertically above her palms... I was thinking of her moving the objects that are at some distance, like TV remote or books in a shelf, a bottle from the fridge or something like that...)

But thank you so much for the efforts.. the sketch is very nice... actually she is looking more like a normal girl, which is what I wanted, and especially the expression on her face is very good, it almost suits the setting of my story. Thank you once again, friend :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Rendezvous With Rama* by Arthur C Clarke is a top notch sci-fi that's nothing about any war or destruction, it's completely about a new found planet in the space, called Rama.. I don't know about the rest of the 3 books in the RAMA series if war is involved in them. I don't think they do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've currently set out to do lot of things in life, but everyday I tend to fail at focusing my mind on the actions necessary for those things.. I'm also an aspiring writer, so I was thinking in a metaphorical sense about my failed efforts to tame my mind.. and then I came with the sentence: *"Mind is the wildest horse."*

It would be awesome if somebody can try drawing that. Thank you :) </TEXT>

The books that made me realize the worth and wonder of earth are undoubtedly 

* Henry David Thoreau's *Walden* and 
* Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay called *Nature.* 

Those two works are some of the best things I've ever read about nature. 

After I read them, I truly felt the wonder of being a part of such a miraculous thing called the Mother Earth.

Please share here your favourite Earth Day reads and how they made you realize the magic of living here...

<TITLE> How to plot a line chart on factor datatype? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-15 07:48:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT>  0 down vote favorite
	

I've a csv file with multiple columns. I'm considering only two of them, 'Time' and 'RiseOrFall'. Both are of Factor datatype. Sample data looks like:

    Time RiseOrFall  
    12   32
    34   0  
    56   0
    78   25
    90   29
    123  0
    567  50

I'm trying to create a line chart in R that falls everytime 'RiseOrFall' hits 0 and rises when it's not 0. ('Time' on x-axis and 'RiseOrFall' on Y-axis)

I tried:

countFile - read.csv(file = "counts.csv", nrows = 1000)[, c ('TIME','TRPM')]

ggplot(data=countFile, aes(x=TRPM)) + geom_line()

How can this be achieved in R (possibly using ggplot2 or anything)?? </TEXT>

<TEXT> NOW THAT I'VE ADVISED YOU IN MY PREVIOUS COMMENT ON HOW TO WAKE UP EARLY, NOW LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING HUGELY IMPORTANT. THNKING THAT WAKING UP EARLY WILL INSTANTLY SOLVE ALL YOUR PROBLEMS IS A GODDAMN MISFUCKINGCONCEPTION.. WAKING UP EARLY IS SURELY A GOOD THING NO DOUBT, HOWEVER IT CAN ALSO END UP GIVING YOU MORE PRODUCTIVE TIME TO DO UNPRODUCTIVE TASKS.. SO BE WARNED WHEN YOU WAKE UP AT 4AM ONE MORNING AND FIND YOURSELF DOING THE BEST PROCRASTIANTION EVER IN YOUR LIFE.. THIS IS SOMETHING YOU GOTTA KEEP IN MIND. 

BUT NO WORRIES THERE. I'VE GOT A SOLUTION FOR THAT AS WELL. WHEN YOU DECIDE TO WAKE UP EARLY, TAKE A NOTEBOOK THE BEFORE DAY NIGHT AND WRITE UP IN THERE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IN THE WHOLE OF NEXT DAY. THIS WILL SAVE YOUR VALUABLE TIME IN THE MORNING FROM GETTING LOST IN THE THOUGHTS OF THINKING WHAT TO DO.

TRY THIS AND SHARE YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH OUR OTHER BROTHERS IN THE SUB IF YOU LIKE TO.

GOOD LUCK! </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-04-13 14:47:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Let me explain in detail why I had to come up with this post.
I recently observed a pattern in my reading. I tend to read fantasy and fairy tale related books in rainy season.. I get a vague feeling inside my heart when it is cloudy or raining.. My mind immediately starts to pick the thoughts of magical realms, dark forests, curses and other fantastical stuff. 

I'm not exactly sure about all of this but I guess I know when did all of this start in my life. I'm an aspiring writer. In 2013, when I was a computer science student, I faced some health issues and had to travel back home from my university. It was a journey of 2 days and all that time I was sitting beside a glass window in an AC coach, and was peering out of it. It had been raining most of the journey and so the surroundings outside were drenched, and the greenery that resulted was dark and deeply scenic. Slowly my mind started to think back into a few years and I remembered a favourite fantasy movie of mine: *Pan's Labyrinth.* The film was adorned in fantastic visuals and colour. And now the things I was looking at out of the train window were at par with those that I saw in the film. I felt  abruptly different. My mind started to wander into myriad impossible realms. I just enjoyed the feeling while it lasted.

After I reached home I was prescribed to rest for a couple of weeks until to grow hale and healthy again. So, during that time I picked some books from my shelf, one is *Words from the Myths* by Isaac Asimov, it is full of Greek and Roman mythologies, and the other one was an old edition of National Geographic Magazine with the cover story about *Grimms' Fairy Tales.* The magazine also contained some breathtaking imagery of rain forests that that pertained to other articles in the mag. All along the time I was reading those books it had been raining outside (it was monsoon time). And something about it all got implanted in my mind during that time. Ever since then, whenever the sky turns dark and gloomy with clouds I vaguely start to think of fantasy stories and fairy tales. This even inspired me to write some poetry and bring up some short story ideas during rainy season.

That's the story behind my post. Sorry I had to share it.

Do any of you too have some similar experiences where the weather and the season outside influenced what you read???

<TEXT>  Isaac Asimov's Encyclopedia of Science and Technology from the 1960s.

I consider you to be a damn lucky person. I've been looking for Asimov's non-fiction books in every second hand bookstore that I have visited but with no good success. I only found Opus (both Opus 100   Opus 200 in one) book. I love his non-fiction. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In [this](http://onlinestatbook.com/2/regression/intro.html) tutorial, if you see just above Table 1, the following text is written.

*The example data in Table 1 are plotted in Figure 1. You can see that there is a positive relationship between X and Y. If you were going to predict Y from X, the higher the value of X, the higher your prediction of Y. *

But the predicted Y values have decreased for two X values, (3 and 5). Then why was it mentioned as "the higher the value of X, the higher your prediction of Y" in the above paragraph???  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ever since I'd read Thoreau's works, especially *Walden*, *Civil Disobedience* and recently, *Walking,* I started to firmly believe that Henry had lived by the values that he advocated in his lifetime. 

And, Isaac Asimov is another person. He worked towards knowledge all of his life, and just take a look at what he produced in his time - immensely ingenious work.

People acting their words and beliefs.. that's something that we rarely see in the world. 

After that realization, I wanted to know of those authors who walked their talk.. 

Can you please name some??? Would love to learn about them. </TEXT>

It's a small book, (a discussion between a young boy and an old man) and sheds a lot of light on the issue that argues how we as humans can't create thoughts and ideas from nothing, how our ideas are never original and are all influenced by one thing or the other. The book is full of intellectual enlightenment...  </TEXT>

Also, the film *Into The Wild* talks of some of best books, like Thoreau's *Walden*, that had influenced Chris McCandless set out to do what he did with his life. I love the movies that do such things.

 Ducks are cowards, she explained in cool, clear English, and when you yell at them they run.

I liked that line. Hey, your writing went smooth in the paragraph above that line. Good.

 By creating distance from your life, distance brought not just by physical space but also by time, you gain a lens with which to look back.

You might want to re-write that sentence in a better way. Just try once.

Overall, a connect is missing in the entire piece.. You do have a nice thought process going on in your mind, but we all need to practice more to give those thoughts a better shape. Let's do that. All the best :)

<TEXT> She opened the screen door and stepped out onto the porch.  A breeze rippled her black dress and the crucifix around her neck.  Her dog followed her and it stopped in the threshold.

The paragraph has been tough to read. The flow of words and the way they sounded in my mind wasn't pleasant.

Their yard was small but it had held their family happily for eight years.

*Their yard was small but it had happily held their family for eight years.* Sounds better for me.

Their lawn was covered in a canvas of red and yellow and brown and blackened leaves that heavy winds pushed into wet, huddled clumps.

No no.. something is sounding really bad about all those words.

The paragraph where he dragged the dog out was smooth read.

Well tough shit because this is hard.  I dont want to have to tell my parents about this.  Maybe it will be okay for you but not for me.  Her eyes burned again.    She twisted the rings on her fingers in futile circles.

Ok. So, many of people out there are having tough time with the commas, huh! I always thought it was just me. 

 She stared back across the street.  Her delicate hands curled into jagged fists.

Oh there's a female in the story! Sorry, didn't realize that all along till the pronoun came up. But hey, does that say anything to you??

 such a clear kind of white, such a clear kind of blue

That just repeated twice in one sentence. May be you would want to rewrite it.

Overall, a tough read.. not smooth according to me - unfortunately didn't paint the picture that you were thinking in your mind when you were writing it. May be you might want to try a bit more.

Art is all about doing better, practicing with passion.. So, you and I got a lot of that in front of us. I wish you all the best for the new things you're going to write soon :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> (From India.) I graudated last year and have been working in IT industry since a year. I'm Comp. Sci grad. I work with an MNC, and recently I've shown interest in chatting about Analytics and Data Science related stuff with some senior management of *Business Intelligence* domain in my organization. Now when a new project in Data Science is coming up for the org, they've chosen me to work in that project. Although I feel pretty happy and pleased about that, I sometimes also feel overwhelmed by the stuff I need to learn in Data Science. I was told to improve my Statistics skills and other Data Science related skillset on an urgent basis. 

So, it would be really helpful if you can provide me with a list (that doesn't scare-off a newbie) of skills that I need to develop in order to become good at Data Science.

Note: Although I'm a comp sci grad, my interest has never been towards programming and algorightms... I like Database related stuff like SQL etc. So, please also suggest me what specific programming and algo skills I might need now.

Thank you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I too am an aspiring writer. I like synopsis of stories that one plans to write.. I myself used to write them when I develop an idea of the storyline in my mind. So, I would say that the synopsis of your story sounded very good and pretty deep sci-fi. The presence of sci-fi aspects was clearly apparent, I guess that's pretty much necessary when you're offering a glimpse into your work to a publisher. The story was good but how you wrote the book is what finally matters for the audience, and by looking at how you wrote the summary, I would assume that you wrote a pretty engaging book. So, I can only wish you all the very best.. Hoping some good news to reach you soon about your book publishing :)

I guess something like this one is from Chris Gardner, *The Pursuit of Happiness* : *There was a time in my life when I could become anything I wanted, and one by one I became none of them.*

Oh Shit.. this quote suits me so well right now.. </TEXT>

I need to make a presentation of Descriptive Statistics on this dataset and now I'm unable to figure out where the other 19 variables have gone.. Plz see if you too face the same problem. (If so then this is an error in the dataset itself, right??)

<TITLE> What are your favourite short non-fiction books?? (less than 200 pages) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-13 13:02:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've seen non-fiction books being usually long.. But I love short non-fiction books too. Helps me absorb deep knowledge from short number of pages quickly.

My favourite short non-fiction works are:

*  *Words From The Myths* by Isaac Asimov (pagecount: around 130 pages - contains interesting Greek and Roman mythological tales behind the origin of some of the most used words in English language) (i love this book  more for the mythical stories it told than for its theme).
* *Nationalism* by Rabindranath Tagore (pagecount: around 100 pages - contains Tagore's views on what differs a Country from a Nation)

Do you have any favourite short non-fictional works? Would love to hear about them.. please share the titles and your experiences with them here.

Thanks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like reading very much. It shaped my life.. Basically I love words and I also write.. Recently I started writing short pieces .. So to explore more of this ground, I'm looking for some books that are filled with short stuff.

Please suggest me books that have:

* Splendidnly well weaved words.. like some very short poetry.. something like Gitanjali.. (I have long poetry books already.. now I'm looking for something like one page long at max)
* Beautiful short musings
* Anything well written that's longer than quotes but shorter than stories, like a couple of pages..
* Short myths kind of stuff may be (short)


Sorry, I'm unable to articulate properly what I want, but I guess you get the idea... 

Please suggest lots and lots of works.. (actually I'm an aspiring writer.. So, I'm exploring the beauty of words to fill my mind with it. That being said, if possible, put a note called "extra-works" and suggest whatever other works you think would be helpful for me to chisel myself into a better weaver of words..) 

**Sorry if I'm asking too much of your time and effort with all this... but please help me. Thank you so much.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> He's a true friend... One of the most memorable moments for me in the entire book series is in the 7th book when Ron leaves Harry and goes away from the forest.. and then after a period of time when he comes back.. 

*Ron says: "Dumbledore always knew I was going to leave you, that's why he gave me that Deluminator."*

*"No. He always knew you would want to come back," Harry corrects him.*

That is the most epic moment for me in the friendship of Harry and Ron. I was very very disappointed when this scene is completely left out in the film.

<TEXT> GREAT FUCKING THINGS ARE NEVER EASY. THEY SHOULD NOT BE. WHEN WAS THERE A GODDAMN EASY THING THAT YOU FELT BRAINFUCKING PROUD OF YOURSELF JUST BECAUSE YOU DID IT, A THING THAT NOT MANY OUT THERE HAVE DONE TOO? 

THERE WONT BE ANY. BECAUSE EASY THINGS ARE FUCKING DONE BY EVERY MOTHERFUCKER OUT THERE. SO WHAT SETS YOU APART FROM THAT HENPECKING CROWD? **DISCOMFORT.**

THAT'S RIGHT. DISCOMFORT IS SEEN BY MANY AS AN UNTOUCHABLE. NOBODY WANTS IT. DISFUCKINGCOMFORT IS AN OUTCAST.. BUT HEY THERE IS SOMETHING WE'RE PHENOMENALLY MISSING TO SEE HERE. DISCOMFORT IS LIKE THE DANGEROUS BRIDGE THAT CAN LAND YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE.. IN FRONT OF THAT CAVE OF TREASURE AND MAGIC THAT YOU'VE ALWAYS FUCKING DESIRED FOR. 

OFCOURSE THE PURPOSE IS NOT TO STAY ON THE BRIDGE ITSELF ALL OUR LIVES, BUT TO FUCKING REACH THE OTHER SIDE.. YOU SHOULD NOT LIVE IN DISCOMFORT FOREVER, BUT YOU GOTTA FUCKING USE IT TO MAKE THAT LEAP FORWARD IN YOUR GODDAMN LIFE.. 

AND THE PROPORTION OF DISCOMFORT THAT CAN REALLY TAKE YOU THE PLACE WHERE YOU WANT TO GO IN LIFE IS OF ASTRONOMICAL PROPORTIONS. YOU DO THAT ONLY THROUGH ADDICTION. GET BITCHLICKING ADDICTED TO DISCOMFORT - TO DO SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE FUCKING DOING, THAT NOBODY FUCKING FEELS LIKE DOING.. 

THAT, MY BROTHERS, IS THE WAY TO GREAT THINGS... 

*WELL WOVEN PATHS CAN NEVER PROVIDE THE ADVENTURE LIKE FORESTS DO..*

**THINK ABOUT IT. DO THE DISCOMFORT.**

I recently made [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/ArtBuddy/comments/2xw4y3/im_an_aspiring_writer_im_looking_for_a_buddy_to/) post regarding me wanting somebody to draw art for my writings.. So, I'm a writer guy.. a storyteller (just starting out on taking that up seriously, although as a hobby).

Your project sounds really cool and I would like to really try my hand at something like this.. (can't promise anything as this is absolutely new to me. Never worked on anything related to comics at all.. but want to give it a shot..) 

And also, I too prefer a leisurely pace, because I have a day job and commitments to lot of other creative stuff..

I mean, look at **Interstellar** film.. it wouldn't have been what it is if the humanitarian aspects are not embellished into the plot.. look at that Docking Scene.. You want to save a planet full of people, and live for the your loved ones.. else you would just listen to the robot and not try anything, right! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I mostly like writing fantastical or mind-bending related stuff, like Telepathy, Teleportation, Time Travel, Supernatural elements, Space, Cosmos and etc. I'm kindof starting out on them. Mostly short stories, short random writings and musings. You can take a look at some short stuff that I [wrote recently - ](https://medium.com/word-dust) especially the post titled ["On Looking at the Stars"](https://medium.com/word-dust/on-looking-at-the-stars-56ed4647d431)

I try to be imaginative in my writings and recently I felt like seeing my writings with illustrations, but I'm no good at drawing related activities. 

So, I'm looking for an ArtBuddy who can do that for me for fun (I can't pay any money, sorry about that.. I don't write to make money either, not yet)

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm 24, and I want to be a writer. So it is high time that I started practicing to write fiction. I want to do so through writing short stories first. But I'm looking for a good platform to present my stories to people. I'm using Medium for my blogging activities and sometimes Blogger. Blogger used to be my fav years ago, but recently it has turned to s**t.. really disappointed with that. And Medium is pretty good for articles and blogs, but for a long story kind of posts, I don't think it will suit.

So, I'm kind of looking for any suggestions on how to present my short stories to people. My interest is in writing fantasy (not like an epic fantasy, but mostly like Neil Gaiman, or Stephen King, with a touch of decent fantasy and supernatural elements) science-fiction, fairy tales and etc. 

Thanks for the responses in advance. </TEXT>

* REALIZED MY WEAK POINTS IN MY EXAM PREPARATION AND ALSO LEARNED THE PROPER WAY TO PRACTICE STUFF FOR IT. 
* FOUND A NEW FAVOURITE AUTHOR: *NEIL GAIMAN*. HE'S FUCKING FANTASTIC AT WHAT HE DOES.
* WROTE SOME FINE STUFF FOR MY BLOG.
* AND STARTED WRITING A FAIRY TALE.. SHALL FINISH IT THIS WEEK.

AND ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THINGS:

I REALIZED THAT I NEED TO IMPROVE MY TIME MANAGEMENT FOR PREPARING AND CRACKING THIS EXAM THING THAT I TOOK UP. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING RIGHT NOW IN MY LIFE. I DIDN'T DO THAT WELL IN THE PAST ONE MONTH. SO THAT'S MY CONFESSION AND OPPORTUNITY FOR IMPROVEMENT.

<TEXT> A FEW YEARS AGO THERE CAME A TIME IN MY GODDAMN LIFE WHEN I HAD TO ABSOLUTELY REFUCKINGDEFINE IT. IN ALL ASPECTS BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IN EDUCATION. I WAS MOVED TO MY BOWELS WITH THE NEED TO PROVE MYSELF TO THE MOTHERFUCKING WORLD AROUND ME. I WAS ASKED ON MY FACE IF I AM GOING TO BE A LOSER. I HAD TO FUCKING ANSWER THEIR ASSES WITH MY KICKING-ASS ACHIEVEMENTS. AND GUESS WHAT.. I DID. I FUCKING EXCELLED AN EXAM AND GOT INTO ONE OF THE BEST COLLEGES IN THE COUNTRY FOR MY MASTERS.

BUT, AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, NOW AT THIS PHASE OF LIFE (I AM WORKING IN AN MNC, JUST LIKE MANY PEOPLE OF MY COUNTRY DO, I'M FROM INDIA) I FEEL LIKE I HAVE RAN OUT OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS. I ONCE HAD BEEN ONE ABOVE MANY, BUT NOW I'M BEING JUST ONE AMONG ALL. I FUCKING DON'T LIKE THAT. 

**I.FUCKING.DO.NOT.LIKE.THAT!**

THERE HAD BEEN A CHALLENGE THAT I HAD RAN AWAY FROM IN THOSE ACCOMPLISHING YEARS OF MY PAST. IT WAS A NATIONAL EXAM. I BELIEVED THAT I CAN NOT CRACK IT EVER. I FEARED THAT I WILL BE CRUSHED TO DEATH BY ITS CLAWS. I WAS FUCKING AFRAID. SO I LET IT ALONE. BUT SINCE THAT DAY A PART OF MY HEART HAD BEEN HUNGRY AND DISSATISFIED KNOWING THAT I HAD EVADED THAT CHALLENGE. 

BUT GUESS WHAT MOTHERFUCKERS.. NOW I AM CALLED BACK BY IT. I'VE BEEN SUMMONED BY GOD TO PICK IT FUCKING UP AGAIN NOW AND BEAT IT TO HELL THIS TIME. SO NOW I'VE STARTED PREPARING FOR THAT FUCKING EXAM. TO FUCKING TOP IT.

BUT HERE IS THE DISAPPOINTING PART, BROTHERS. I AM FUCKING ACTING LIKE I FORGOT WHO I WAS. WHEN I SIT IN THE CLASSES FOR THE EXAM PREPARATION, THE PEOPLE AROUND ME ARE BEING FUCKING GIANTS IN KNOWLEDGE (ESPECIALLY MATH) THAT I NEED TO POSSESS TOO. I USED TO POSSESS THAT KNOWLEDGE. BUT NOW I FORGOT ALL THAT GLORY.

LAST WEEK MY MIND WAS FUCKED WHEN I SAW ALL THOSE PEOPLE ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS AND I DIDN'T HAVE A FUCKING CLUE.

**BUT I CAN NOT LEAVE IT AGAIN. I WILL FUCKING NOT. I WILL LOOK THIS CHALLENGE IN THE FACE AND SPIT ON IT. I WILL TIE THIS CHALLENGE TO MY MIND'S BED AND FUCKING RAPE IT EVERY NIGHT. I WILL GRAB MY FEAR OF THIS EXAM BY ITS HAIR AND FEED ITS FUCKING ENTRAILS TO MY SPIRIT-HOUNDS.**

YES I FORGOT MY HISTORY AND PAST GLORY.. NEVERTHELESS, I WILL REWRITE IT WITH THE NEW STORY. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There was a Telugu movie I saw a long time ago.. and there is this scene where the heroine goes to an interview and the interviewer, after finishing all his questions, asks her to close her eyes and speak out what all the things she saw in the room from the time she entered. She tells a good detail of things in the room like wall poosters, clocks, or books and especially (here is the kind the books I want to ask for) she tells about the items placed on either sides of his hands on the table and thus deduces that the interviewer is a left handed person. I really liked her observations skills especially of the handedness...

Now, can somebody please suggest me some books where I can learn about such stuff??

<TEXT> (FROM INDIA) VERY UPLIFTING POST, BROTHER. A DAY STARTED WITH READING A BOOK IS ONE OF A KIND I TELL YOU. TO START A DAY THAT WAY WHERE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DON'T EVEN READ A SINGLE BOOK FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR, IS A KICK-ASS KIND OF LIVING. I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT I LOVE READING TOO. THAT BEING SAID, NOW REGARDING MY DAILY ROUTINE:

I USED TO MEDIDATE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING, BUT THAT ROUTINE DETERIORATED A BIT RECENTLY. I'M TRYING TO GET BACK TO IT. APART FROM THIS, I START MY DAY BY STUDYING FOR A NATIONAL LEVEL ENTRANCE EXAM THAT I'M PREPARING FOR. I HAVE A DAY JOB AS WELL.

WHEN I START MY DAY WITH SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE IN THE BASKET I FEEL REALLY GOOD FOR THE ENTIRE DAY. ESPECIALLY WHEN I MEDIDATE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING, THE REST OF THE DAY IS PERSPICUOUSLY DIFFERENT FROM EVERY OTHER DAY.

FORTUNATELY TODAY I MEDIDATED BEFORE STARTING MY DAY.

APART FROM THAT, I MOSTLY PLAN THE EXAM STUDIES BEFORE I GO TO BED. THIS HELPS ME LAUNCH MYSELF DIRECTLY INTO PRODUCTIVE MODE THE NEXT MORNING RATHER THAN INVESTING TIME IN DECIDING WHAT TO WORK ON.

THERE ARE TIMES WHEN MY PLANS GET DISTURBED.. BUT I'M TRYING TO BRING ORDER TO SUCH CHAOS.  </TEXT>

I KNOW I WILL BOUNCE BACK. BUT I DON'T FUCKING LIKE TO KEEP BOUNCING BETWEEN GOOD AND BAD FEELINGS SO GODDAMN FREQUENTLY. I DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE THE PRICE OF A STOCK ON THE SHAREMARKET.. I WANT TO BE FUCKING CONSISTENT IN MY PLANS AND LIVING.

I FUCKING DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHY IT IS SO. 

**ARE WE FUCKING AFRAID TO SHARE WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING IN OUR GODDAMN LIVES?**

**ARE WE FUCKING SHY TO RISE FROM THE AHSES AND BE THE PHOENIXES THAT WE ARE?**

WHAT THE HELL IS STOPPING US FROM COMING AND CONNECTING WITH THE LOVELY BROTHERHOOD AND SHARE SOME FUCKING MOTIVATION?

OK... ENOUGH RANT.. NOW, BORROWING THE WORDS FROM GANDHI, I WOULD RATHER BE THE CHANGE I WANT TO SEE IN THE GODDAMN WORLD AROUND ME. SO I'M GOING TO MAKE POSTS HERE REGULARLY. 

I DON'T KNOW IF ANY BUTTHOLE OUT THERE IS LISTENING TO THIS BUT I REALLY WANT US TO BE GODDAMN WINNERS IN OUR CHOSEN ASPECTS OF LIFE, WHATEVER THE FUCK THEY MAY BE. AND I DON'T WANT THIS SUB TO BE A STAGNANT FUCKING POND, RATHER I WANT IT TO BE THE BLOOD IN OUR BODIES, ALWAYS FLOWING AND KEEPING US FUCKING ALIVE.

<TEXT> Great idea.. and it's most of the times true in my case as well. Music has myriad times influenced my mood to write.. It moved me so much that I once immediately started to write a poetic piece, which I felt as my best work yet. (It's a heartfelt message to my girlfriend while I was in college.)

Most of the times it is film sound tracks.. Hans Zimmer, especially.. I'm from India, so I would like to more names to it: A.R.Rahman, Shankar-Eshaan-Loy, Amit Trivedi etc.. These people's music had influenced my thought process many times and pushed me towards writing something refreshing, which I didn't have in mind moment prior to listening to their music..

However, I don't everytime get influenced by music alone in order to put my thoughts to words. No body should, because it will make you feel dependant on it. That's not how creativity shold work always. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let me ask: what kind of an idiot helps a person who he met only days ago, and assists him in killing a person, or rather commit the murder himself?? I mean, there was nothing where he questions Raymond what is the real matter behind all those Arabs following him and why is he carrying a revolver. He always agrees for whatever Raymond asks for, not just about partying out, but also in hurting and killing somebody. What is existentialism? Is it straight ahead killing somebody whom you think is trying to harm you? Why did nobody, neither the protagonist nor Raymond, ever tried to speak it out with the Arabs before using the weapon, guys?? What kind of *ism* is that?? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been trying to read one book per week this year.. so this week i picked up *The Stranger* by Albert Camus, looking at its classic status, and also because it is a small book (I like small books). I've enterted into the Part II of the book just now, and all along Part I the book seemed to be having no soul or story - it just went on and on randomly to here and there - with characters that came up having no good depth.. and also the narration is pretty dull. I guess this is the book in a long time that I read half without finding a single quote to highlight.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah.. why not.. Positive thinking/attitude has proven multiple times that it can make great changes in the world.. and in people's lives.. Although telekinesis would directly mean moving things physically, optimistic mindset also appears to do the same with the situations of life - it physically changes the circumstances of a person's life and makes him get what he desired. For example, **placebo effect**- the way people think and perceive a situation literally makes changes in the same. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I will never give out spoilers for anything.. I hate ruining any kind of experiences of people.. That being said, I felt The Giver as just ok because I don't enjoy dystopian novels very much.. They just feel very depressing. I'm not good with the books that give out such feeling.. I even disliked *1984* by George Orwell especially for this reason, while I loved his *Animal Farm*.

Talking particularly about *The Giver* the narration seemed a bit different and most of the times very straight not bothering about exploring the feelings of characters in depth, although it helped in keeping the book short, which I like. 

So, you might completely enjoy the book if you're fine with dystopian concepts - it's a good book for those who enjoy such setting.

*Practice should be directed from achievement to non-achievement. Usually when you do something, you want to achieve something, you attach to some result. From achievement to non-achievement means to be rid of the unneccesary and bad results of effort. If you do something in the spirit of non-achivement, there is a good quality in it. So just to do something without any particular effort is enough.*

But, let's say I'm preparing for a National level entrance exam that would put me into a great college for higher education. So, I will surely be attached towards a result - to get into the top college in the country. But that paragraph speaks against it.

Am I looking at it the wrong way? What would be the actual interpretation of that paragraph in this scenario?

I'm sorry to put it like this but I'm 100% positive that this is not it.. Your translation speaks of negativity of mind and thought.. But the point in the book where the paragraph came up is not in least bit relevant to what you said. Anyways, thank you for the response. </TEXT>

and can also be blissful.. trust me.. the kind of solitude you will experience while travelling and visiting places alone, in a way, such solitude can not be attained even by meditation. It is such. It can be enlightnening, but for that you need to retrsopect into your life and talk to your conscience.. Take some books with you that talk about nature and world around you, even such poetry would do.. Go, explore the solitary travels. Good Luck :)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Today I was listening to some podcast where the panel members mentioned that in the recent days there are many, many new planets that are being continuously discovered and that most of them are just gas planets. Listening to that I got this doubt: 

*Considering the Big Bang theory, wasn't our Earth too a gas planet at its infancy, which later cooled down and developed into a full fledged life-supporting home? So, if those new planets are now designated as gas planets, doesn't that give way to the possibility of them turning into life suppoorting planets later on in the unvierse's eventual timeline, just like Earth did??* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah that's a good idea.. In my country (India) a recent best selling book series called: *Shiva Trilogy* by Amish Tripati had a smiliar experience. The first book in the series was rejected by nearly 20 publishers.. and so he made a trailer of the book's concept and released it on Youtube.. and also released the first chapter. People liked and the buzz grew around it.. and eventually publishing companies came to him and published his book. Now, his trilogy is a massively famous book series in India. And I even heard that for his next book, which he hasn't even written, a publishing house already bought the rights in advance with a price of around 5 crore rupees.. 

So, yes just try putting a part of it infront of the people and see what happens. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't understand why publishers/editors reject a book even after thinking it's a good one. How can they decide that a book won't be liked by people when they didn't even publish it? I think they're the most judgemental people on the planet. Really sorry for your situation. But I'm sure something WILL turn up and your book WILL be published.. It's all about the time. Let it take the time it is asking for.. You will surely be rewarded worthily. I will give you an example.. 

*When I was doing masters, almost 80% of my class got recreuited from campus but among the other 20% was one of my best friends in the class.. he tried like all of us but he couldn't get through all that year. Eventaully when the college was over, he left without a job in hand unlike most of his classmates.. He needed a job desperately. He persevered another year, and on Dec 24th, 2013 he was recruited as a Banker by the biggest private bank in India. (Yeah, this is all from India). And his salary is higher than the average salary of the entire batch. Well, he waited and persevered, and he got better than what most people did.*

I believe in such things.. and now in your case also something makes me feel the same way. You will rise! </TEXT>

<TEXT>  you are totally a reading elitist

I don't know if you ever heard of Chetan Bhagat.. He is India's best selling author.. and also the most criticized.. Well, I'm a great fan of him... Now, me being his fan, in my country if I say I'm an elitist, the actual elite people will beat me to hell. Believe me. If you don't, then google the criticism for Chetan Bhagat.. 

I'm not an elitist. Life is more enjoyable when you have a reading habit.. and having that habit I feel my life is better in terms of interestingness than a non-readers life. That's just my feeling, not an elitist way of looking at the world. If you still feel that way, then I'm sorry, pal. Keep hating me :) </TEXT>

By that what I meant is that a person who is reading something that *he* feels is interesting to him has the right to feel the work is worthy of investing his own time and concentration, no matter what other people think about it.. For example, many people criticise Dan Brown and Malcom Gladwell, but both are my favourite Fiction and Non-Fiction authors respectively. I feel their books are worthy of my time and thought.. That is all what I meant.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> *The Brief History of Time* by Stephen Hawking - fits your specs of scientific non-fiction.. That being said, there are great books in non-ficiton domain. Try exploring books that are outside the apparent science genre because when you look keenly, everything has science at its heart. 

Books by :

* Malcolm Gladwell, Nassim Nicholas Taleb (fall under Social Science)
* Michael Lewis, Tim Harford  ( fall under Financial Science)

are very insightful.

And then:

* Isaac Asimov (if you ever find any non-ficiton book by this person, devour it without second thought, he's that good.)
* try reading biographies of remarkable people.. I loved Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson
* Walden by Henry David Thoreau   Into The Wild by Jon Krakauer
* A must read novel: *Flatland* by Edwin A. Abbot
* The Flipside by Adam J. Jackson

These are some of my recommendations for now, just to make you get used to reading interesting stuff.. and once you do that you will automatically start finding books on your own! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I experience this whenever I stay away from reading for more than a couple of days. Something seems missing in my daily life when I do that. And this quote seemed very appropriate for this sub where *reading* is a part of our lives... So I just thought we should see this.

EDIT: This post made some people feel like we are looking down upon non-readers.. No. We are not.. And this quote doesn't share even the least bit of such intentions. *Reading is about knowledge, but it is no real knowledge if it doesn't tell you how to treat people that are different from you in ways that you feel are vital for a person's ethos.* I offer my apologies to all those who felt hurt by a few number of comments that some people (may be even me) posted here. We sincerely don't mean to hurt anybody ever in the matters of book reading.. **May be we kid sometimes, here and there, but we are all a brotherhood here!** 

Thanks, everyone :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> ok.. after moving to Pune in March of 2014, I had been to a book sale where they were selling books by weight.. 1 KG for (just) Rs.100/-

I bought 23 books for (just) Rs.570/-

<TITLE> How are Literature Nobels awarded? Are they given for an Author's specific work or for the Author's work all along? </TITLE>

<TEXT> I've always had this doubt since I read *Gitanjali* by Rabindranath Tagore, him being the first author I read that was awarded Nobel in Literature.. and then I went on to read Ernest Hemingway's *Old Man And The Sea* and John Steinbeck's *Of Mice And Men*... 

I loved *Gitanjali*, liked *Of Mice and Men* and disliked *Old Man and the Sea*.. 

I thought it's time I clarify to myself about how Nobels are awarded in Literature category. So, here I am asking about it. Please shed some light. Thanks :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> The main thing that drove me and still drives me towards reading more books is *I'm an aspiring writer*.. and to write better you gotta read better and read like hell... So once I tried to take up writing seriously, and as they say *when you pick up one end of the stick you pick up the other end too..*, I had to take reading seriously as well... and that lead me through myriad portals toward the kind of stuff I'm interested to read/write about.. and I kept picking up books.. 

So, that's the most important thing about forming my reading habit.. and also another vital aspect is I was gifted a *Kindle Paperwhite* by my brother-in-law for my birthday around July 2013, and thence my reading habit got redefined :)

And coming to the part of feeling reading as a *chore*: I've a weakness in my mind.. that is when I start reading a book and if I don't feel interested in it or if it felt tough or anything, I simply cannot give up reading it.. I feel defeated by that book when I do that.. I somehow continue it till I end it.. So during such times, yes, reading feels like a chore... In the list I mention in the post, the books that especaily felt like that were: *The Loser* by Peter Ustinov and *Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by R. L. Stevenson* (I'm trying to fight this weakness, which would help me save time and makes reading not to feel like a chore, at times..)

Rest all were fine, but I obviously didn't like all the books equally... 

So, that's about it :)

Thank you so much for the interest you showed in asking me about my habit forming.. </TEXT>

I loved each of them.. and among biographies, last year I read and **loved** *Into The Wild* and *Walden* (although not a bio) and another technology book about Big Data.. and I also started *Steve Jobs* by Walter Isaacson but did not finish it as I didn't carry the book with me later... But i loved whatever I read from it.

 The non-fiction book that I'm currently reading is *Representative Men* by Ralph Waldo Emerson.. and I plan to pick up *The Information* by James Gleick in 2015 :)

Non-fiction is almost always awesome :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know they're not great numbers compared to what people here usaually hold.. But still, I did fine for where I came from..  I'm a non-native in English, (from India), so I slowly picked up the habit of reading books, and now they're an integral part of my life. Books mean a lot to me. My dream is to become an English language novelist. So, I look forward to develop my reading habits and abilities to a great extent in the future.

The list of the 25 books that I've finished in 2014 are:

* *The Illusions* by Richard Bach 
* *The Flipside* by Adam J Jackson
* *Animal Farm* by George Orwell
* *Saving Faith* by David Baldacci 
* *The Loser* by Peter Ustinov 
* *The Undercover Economist* by Tim Harford 
* *The Tipping Point* by Malcolm Gladwell 
* *Screw It, Lets Do It* by Richard Branson 
* *Flatland* by Edwin A. Abbott 
* *1984* by George Orwell 
* *Prey* by Michael Crichton 
* *The Giver* by Lois Lowry

<TEXT> * Opening paragraph was well engaging. 
* Second paragraph was tough to read and sounded very confusing.
* Third slowly seemed to be losing direction.

Ok, now I better probably stop pointing out para wise.. All paragraphs can and should be improved for easy readability and visualization. 

Now, there are for sure very good lines from the letter:

 What are words, but dancers upon a page? 

Awesome opening line.

 the way you stabbed them with your tongue.

Very well put sentence.

 And this letter will never meet your lips.

I didn't get if the narrator was expecting the letter to be kissed (*meet the lips?*) or just be read (done by lips as well). If you meant 'to be read' this line can be better put as: *And this letter will never flow through your lips.*  or better: *And this letter will never flow through your lips and into your heart.*

And one more thing about my critique.. If my words hurt your feelings, don't take me seriously... Keep up the good work and do awesome writing as always.

[As you mentioned that you wrote this piece over a year ago, and as it is usually said that you need a good amount of time between you *write* something and you come back to edit or *re-work* on it... I guess you just didn't look into it after that year's time, and directly posted here without reworking upon it. It's visible, the *first-draftness* in the writing] </TEXT>

<TEXT> First of all, I was expecting great story from the book because of all the hype of it being a classic and all.... and most importantly due to the depressive environment the entire book had bestowed upon me (I must say, in this case the author succeeded in making me feel the Dystopian time completely.. Orwell did great work at that)... So, I guess, I disliked the book mostly because I was expecting lot of great thrilling story from it rather than focusing on the classic idea of privacy invasion.. so that's the reason. My bad. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Recently got rejected by a girl in my workplace and Interstellar helped me get over it. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-17 07:35:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> (This is all from India) A couple of months ago I started liking a girl in my office.. She is a very beautiful girl.

 I'm a writer by hobby, and the beauty of that girl made me pen some lines about her. I wrote a poetic piece, titled as [Her](https://medium.com/@krishna_mydream/her-c95a39117644) and I gave it to her. I don't know if she even read it or not. I tried a few times to talk to her in person after showing her that poetry, but she straight away refused so talk to me. 

This whole incident had toubled me for weeks, my mind was occupied by her thoughts.. and then one fine day, November 8th, I watched the most awaited movie, *Interstellar* - and that's it.. The chains of that girl's beauty that had imprisoned my mind all along this time could not hold me back any longer, and they freed me.

 The grandeur of the cosmic tale told in the film had made my mind to wash away many trivial troubling things of my life, among which is my liking towards that girl. 

I'm an aspiring writer. After witnessing the mind bending brilliance of Interstellar, I realized that I had better things to do in my life than to sit back and feel bad for a rejection. 

Interstellar really expanded the horizons for my exploration of stories. Now, standing in front of the enigmatic journeys into the tales of wonders of the Unvierse I can voyage into, worrying about a girl seem merely unworthy of my mind's thought process.

Thank you so much for all this, *Interstellar* :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> First, simply put *Walden* is called an *American* classic because it is a classic work written by an american (I'm an Indian, by the way). 

And second, it is definitely a classic book, no questions asked. In *Walden* Thoreau's insights about where the Mankind is going in the matters of human character and environmental love, the two things that are put into each of us from the moment we take birth, are nothing less than astounding. There are many instances in the book that are capable of making us feel embarrased for the way we're living on this planet, without worrying least bit about this eternal(?) home of ours. If there is one book that should be seen with no boundaries of country, it would surely be this. Hence, please don't call *Walden* a specific *country's* classic, rather call it a Mankind's classsic, which it is undoubtedly is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't generally read this kind of fiction.. I'm usually into Thrillers, Sci-Fi, Non-Fiction.. But after knowing that the movie by David Fincher has done so well I thought of picking up the book before watching the film adaptation of it.. and it was an amazing experince over all.. The most interesting part about the book is that both male (Nick) and female (Amy) narrations are great.. The thing that most intrigued me is how well Amy character turned out as the story moved forward.. It evolved very powerfully. I loved it. 

 A 4/5 book for me in the recent days... Awesome :) :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you so much for the interest.. It's a simple breathing pattern/technique. But I'm afraid I won't be able to articulate the process and benefits of Sudharshana Kriya as much as the *The Art Of Living Foudation* does, the institution where I learned it from.. So, [here is the link](http://www.artofliving.org/in-en/what-sudarshan-kriya) to where you can get a glimpse of what the Kriya process is all about.. Whatever is explained in there, believe it or not, it sure did change my thought process a couple of years ago, and I'm a person who stronly believes that your thoughts make your life, hence I can happily say that it did bring a great change in my life. (And you can also find many videos of the Kriya process on the internet, in case if you wanna try learning it.)

Good Luck and Namaste :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> The narrator seems to be too biased and at times even came out as an asshole.

The type of girl who "went to college," but majored in communications and sleeping with professors.

I told you, the 'asshole' type of thinking, it is especially because of the above sentence. It felt like the most judgemental sentence I've read in the recent days. Even grammer didn't seem fit for that repelling sentence: *majored* (past tense) and then *sleeping* (continous tense). I'm not sure if that's right (I'm not native in English) but I'm having a feeling that its not, because the sentence sure sounds very wrong grammatically as well. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Moment </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-08 05:31:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Today when I was practicing Sudharshana Kriya, I observed, or rather experienced, one profoundly simple realization. When I dived deep into the breathing pattern at the end of the Kriya process, there came one frozen frame in time, Im calling it the *Moment*, where I realized what present moment means. 

At that one frame of time (I refer to it as a frame of time because I dont want to give it a unit of measurement, like the *second,* and make it sound quantifiable) everything in my life, both the past and the future seemed to be unified, aligned in one straight line telling me what I have been doing all my life has led me to this moment and what I do now will lead me further.

*We live not thinking about the past or dreaming about the future. Although theyre necessary at times, we sure create them both with the building blocks of present.*

I know, this is not a new concept, but the way I experienced it, deep down in meditation, had impacted me more, like never before. I guess what made this more influential is an activity I undertook the day before. I decided to take up Zen, which is all about experiencing the moment as you live through it. 

Dots do connect.

And I understood the singularity of life.

But in the one that I commented, it says we worry about things that are not going to happen.. thus not justifying our worries.

<TEXT> I guess the quote actually reads: "I've lived through some terrible things in my life, some of which **never** happened."

He was talking about how worrying about the things that might go wrong is actually worse than those things themselves. I can't point out to the source, but I sure remember Twain telling it this way. 

It makes sense.

 I'm honestly surprised how well this is written for being non-native! Can I ask how long you've been writing in English? 

Thank you so much for the compliment. I've been writing in English for four years now. Mostly I wrote blogs and articles (but with lot of errors, I now realize), never serious ficiton though except for a couple of short stories. Tried my hand at writing real fiction in the past but didn't work so kept it on hold. Now I felt that it is time I took it up seriously. So here I am writing flash fiction for practice. 
 
 I think fix up this stuff 

Yes, I just did.. I wholeheartedly thank you so very much for the help :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I will just critique like a reader himself who can also write. I'm not a native English speaker, I'm from India:

* In the opening line, the word 'exactly' being used multiple times slightly made the sentence a bit pretentious. Try changing that, if you can.

 He had huge hands, so long that if it stretched it, it would go through the walls and..
 
I think it should be "He had huge hands, so long that if he (you just mentioned the monster as a He) stretched them (plural, *hands* - right) they would go (plural again.)

 So thats why it sat on its toes,

Hmm, fine. But maybe sitting on its (or his, I'm not sure. its is fine though) knees would do better, I guess.

 It was just sitting there staring at me, **with its eyes**,

I don't think that emphasizing that it is staring at you with its eyes is necessary. Everything in the universe looks with its eyes only, no!

 They looked like ordinary human eyes except they were extremely yellow, and instead of a pupils it had a lightings, opening a persons mind into another world, most people called it a nightmare, but to me it was a dreamland.

Good and important sentence, but first of all it's too long, without easy readability and also grammatical errors. Singular - Plural mostly ('a pupils', 'a lighting's' - just pupils - no a, 'a' makes it singular; same for lightings - no a and also no apostrophe, I guess). But I would say instead of 'lightings' find a better word. May be *sparks.*

 Most children at that age liked to go to the

Most children at *my* age  - would've done better, because a moment later you're bringing that point onto you, saying that you like staring at it rather. So, this seemed better. 

 So I told my mother, she embraced me, and told me that monsters dont exist.

Embraced is not establishing your point here. You can expand this point. Because it's an important one. It is showing that he was not believed by people. So, this can be better I guess: "So, I told my mother. She looked back at me with a calm and unsurprised but an understanding look in her eyes. She took me close and hugged me, and said that monsters dont exist."

I don't know if you like my description but it I'm trying to tell you that this is an important moment in the story and so finishing it so justly wouldn't do good.

 refusing to neither eat nor drink anything until I saw the monster again.

It's *either - or*. Because you already said *refusing* which is a negative, and *neither - nor* is again a negative. No double negatives.

 As a kind hearted mother she couldnt bare it, she refuse to believe me.

It's bear - not bare. And refused. 

Ended the story well. Overall, I liked the story. It's very good. I like such fantastic and mystic incidents put into words. And coming to your writing. I sense that English is not your native language. It's not mine too, like I mentioned at the beginning. So, you have some grammatical errors. Needed correcting. But after the sentence "As a kind hearted mother she couldnt bare it, she refuse to believe me." Everything went too fast. Situations aren't established well. Maybe you can take a second look on that.

overall it's a 7/10 for the storyline. English is to be improved grammatically.

But I'm having a feeling that you're going to do a lot better in the coming days. In some ways, I see myself in you. I see my own writing in yours. We can all improve and we should -  we will.

All the very best... And once again, Good story.. keep it up :)



[And hey, now a quick tip about posting in this Sub. Do select a **flair** for your story, like a genre. Yours can be *Fantasy*, I guess. And also critique others' stories. Else they put you into Leeching (they already did, which is why I'm telling this. Normally leeched posts are ignored by members here.) which means you're a freeloader over here, taking critiques but never giving them back to others. I faced it last week. You please don't. You wrote a good story.]

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is my second flash fiction. (I'm from India and English is not my native language. But I love this language which is why I made writing in it as my life's purpose.) Here, I tried to voice out the character's mystic experiences in his life. I didn't emphasize in this piece on the name of the character or his environment or such minute daily life details, but on his internal voice. And it's also written in first person.  Please critique it in whatever way you think will be helpful for improving my fiction-writing skill. I'm open to all your comments.Thank you, all :)

                                                       THE VAGUE LIGHT

It is said that you shouldnt chase butterflies; rather you should sit down and wait for them to come to you. Well, I didnt chase butterflies, but all my life I had chased a light, a particular light that I saw in my dreams. 

The light appeared for the first time in my dream when I was a child. I remember that day because I was laughed at by the entire class for failing in the 5th grade Math exam. After that night, after I saw that light in my dream, Math ceased to scare me anymore. The light didnt make me a genius in Math, but it did stop me from being scared of it. In a way, it protected me.

Eventually, I turned 16, and got my first rejection from a girl I liked in my neighborhood. I asked her out on my birthday. She took it for a joke but when I told her I meant it she felt annoyed and stopped talking to me. I liked her very much, the rejection bothered me. And then one night, that light appeared again in my dreams. From the day after, looking at that girl never troubled me. 

There came a time when I needed a job desperately. I was 24. I couldnt get any job due to the financial meltdown that hit the world hard. I felt like a loser looking at all the comfortable parts of peoples lives, and wondered why I always reside on the other side of the things that I wished in my life. I didnt find an answer because at the moment finding a job felt more reasonable than finding answers to the unanswerable questions of life. So, I restarted my job search, and yet after months time nothing seemed to be changing. I became weaker at heart with each email response I never got from the companies I applied for. I started believing in all the bad things in the world that happen to good people. I had always thought that I was one of those good people and now my current situation in life only confirmed it.

Not finding a job made me unhappy and dissatisfied. Happiness and satisfaction in life can be measured in the amount of peaceful sleep one gets every night. If you can go to bed and sleep without anything bothering you, youre a happy man. I used to sleep happily every night, holding in mind the dreams for my future, but now I held only despair. Night by night my sound sleep moved farther and farther away, but it left the sound part behind for me, the sound of unruly thoughts, the noise of desperation to make a career, and the necessity to have a constant income  they stayed with me. I truly reached an impasse on life, and it was all darkness. I needed light.


It happened in the middle of the night. I opened my eyes to a white nothingness. I couldnt see a thing. It was blindingly bright, but it was familiar. Whichever side I turned my sight to it was only infinite luminance. The light. It came back for me. I couldnt move. I just stood there in front of it, inside it, becoming one with it. After some time, I was disappearing into the light; or maybe it felt like all that light was disappearing into me, but I didnt know for sure. I slowly felt the falling, quietly, drifting down, towards something. And I opened my eyes to the bright rays of morning sun spreading on the walls of my room. 

That day, I decided to start my own business and never look for a job again. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  It's not wasted work, it's practice.

This is one great piece of advice. Nailed it.

 Experience a story every day. You'll magically feel motivated to write again.

I recently started writing Flash-Fiction to get better at writing fiction. This is how I'm trying to feel everyday, experiencing a new story!

Thanks.. All the very best for the great future ahead :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like the flash fiction pieces that emphasize more on *single-scene* settings rather than long *short-stories*. It gives more chance to take the reader into a part of the story, like waking up to a moment into the dream.. You never remember all of the dream, only few vague portions of it. [Flash Fiction, according to me should be like that, or at least *that's my style*.]

Your work is good. The descriptions were easy enough to paint a good visual picture to the reader. Keep it at that level, it's good. Now, on the other side of the things, the writing from the point where a gun was pointed at the back of his head to the moment the stranger entered the last digit into the safe.. things didn't seem much clear. It felt like what you wanted to say wasn't properly delivered. In short, that part was unclear. 

Over all.. Good work 7/10.

 All the best for the next one :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Under The Dome* being more than 800 pages did put me away from picking it up till now, but someday I will read it, which is why I never watched the TV Series past S01E01. But then Stephen King is like that only. Master Artists don't mind the length when they're really keen on their work. But then hey this is a misconception. In Harry Potter series multiple books are way more than 400 pages, but they're a part of my life and may be I would've been disappointed if they were written any shorter. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  the premise of the story is good, but the dialogue just didn't seem natural.

Yes.. when I re-read it on and on I'm feeling this too. That's where I think I need to concentrate from now on. Any suggestions are most welcome :)

 you were translating from Indian to English

I really wasn't trying to do that, I was writing in direct English. But knowing that this is how it sounds to reader made me feel real awkward about my writing. But thanks for coming up with this point, because I believe this is a very vital aspect for a non-native English fiction writer, which I completely am.

 The last part, while a really good idea, isn't executed quite right. I found it really hard to believe that somebody would throw keys that close to another person (even if they don't like her) and that she would have time to stand up, hear someone say "MYTHYA, WAIT, DONT STAND! (by the way, caps made it seem like the person was screaming at the top of his lungs which would take even more time), and then throw her hands up to cover her face. I don't think her reaction to that warning would be to cover herself. 

Special thanks for pointing out the occurrence errors.. will keep that in mind next time.

 I think it might be better if Praveen said: "Mythya, look out!" as that would signal that there is some sort of danger coming at her.

Now, that is very straight and simple (why didn't I do that before!) 

Thank you for the entire response which is going to influence me in the direction of good writing :) :) 

And I would like to ask you if you know of any resources that would help me in bettering my *dialogue.*

<TEXT> Hey PrpleWlf, thank you so very much for the extra effort. Your suggestions are very supportive. The way you pointed out the difference between usage of languages depending on region is very new and helpful. And coming to my nativity thing, although I'm from India, my life's aim is to become a very good English language novelist. I've great stories to tell, but the kind of fiction-writing skill that I possess puts me far away from it. I will take up the journey and travel far to reach it. 

And special thanks for re-writing the first paragraph in your way, this would help me think better the next time when I rework on it. Although getting a translator is a good idea, I want to put up the necessary skill into myself to become good at writing fiction. Courses would be a good idea.. thank you for mentioning that :) :)

 Truly hoping this is of some great help, and not to demoralizing;

Your response is in no way demoralizing. It is truly some great help.
Thank you so much :)

<TEXT> Thank you so very much for the critique :)

I have to say that it was very difficult as an English reader to get through simply due to the grammatical issues

Can you please point out where I went wrong?? Honestly, I believed that my English is good, but looking at what you just said, I now feel the fire to learn where in my grammar that I should improve.. Thank you so much for that. 

 While the ideas behind the story are good, the grammar takes away from it.

Yes. This is a real trouble.. Please shoot at me whatever suggestions you have in this aspect. 

 Do not take this to mean you should give up in writing,

I can never do that. Never!

 I would not expect myself to be able to write in your own native tongue without first learning the language

You just opened my eyes to the fact that I do not know English as good enough as a writer should know. (I mean, I speak good English everyday with people all around me. Even now, I'm talking to you fine, I believe, with no grammatical errors.)

Thank you once again for the very uplifting review.. If you can, just help me with the above mentioned issues as well. Thanks :) :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I realized Flash Fiction to be very helpful for polishing your writing abilities. This one here is my first flash fiction. It might even probably suck. But I don't mind. I'm here to listen to you guys and improve my fiction-writing skill, or rather build it up. I don't know. Please just critique this piece as much as you can. I want only to get better, that's my sole purpose. (I'm from India, so English is not my native language, but suggest me there as well.) Thank you all very much :)







It was 10.15 AM on a Monday morning, and peoples minds were just migrating from a weekend induced relaxation to the work environment again, getting their psyche ready for the next five days of hustle bustle in their daily lives.



Mythya was seated at her desk with her hands loudly and busily typing a mail to her manager about the tasks for the week ahead. She does that every Monday. She looked at the clock, and pictured how the next 5 days were going to be. *Occupied as always with nothing unusual ever to happen in my life,* she thought. 



Karthik sits opposite to Mythya, four desks ahead. Distracted by the typing noise, turned his head to see who it was that sounds involved in work so seriously already, and found that most of his team mates were not even seated at their desks. Hey who is disturbing the blissful morning silence with the noise of work? asked Karthik.



Praveen and Vinod were standing few rows away from Mythya. Praveen was stretching his body, getting ready to go and get a bite of something in the cafeteria. Beside him Vinod was holding the key ring of his shelf and playing with it in his hands.



Its her, said Praveen lazily, pointing to Mythya, she must be sending her work schedule for the week. 



Yes, guys, responded Mythya, just typing the usual weekly mail. We all got to do this.



Yeah, right, but not already, said Karthik. Its Moday morning, for Gods sake, kill some time. 



She looked at him and chuckled.



Praveen stared at Mythya for a moment and something came up in his mind. Karthik, talking of work, I guess I left some important papers at your desk last Friday. 



Yeah, you did. I locked them up in Vinods shelf, said Karthik pointing to the desk next to him. 



Vinod felt attentive at the mention of his name. Oh yes, sorry, I forgot to mention that, he said to Praveen, still playing with the key ring.




Karthik, please do me a favour, started Praveen. Im going for breakfast, meanwhile please take out those papers and keep them at your desk. Ill come back and collect. 



Sure. Just get me the keys of the shelf. 



Yeah, right. Please hand him your keys, he said turning to Vinod.



Here, catch, called out Vinod, and raised his fist to throw the key. 



At the exact same instant Mythya started to rise from her desk. Praveen observed this. MYTHYA, WAIT, DONT STAND! he said, loudly.



By then the key ring had left Vinods hand and was shooting towards Mythyas head which abruptly appeared in its trajectory.



Listening to her name in a loud caution, Mythya reflexively raised her both hands in defense, covering her face and head.



As she did this, the key that was about to hit her had stopped in front of her hands, but it did not fall down  *it started to float in the mid-air.*

I meant the ideas that people come up with. They can be original, of course. Imagine J.K. Rowling coming here years ago and asking how it would be if she builds a world where they teach magic to kids as a field of academics.. I guess, Harry Potter wouldn't have been as big a phenomenon as it is today if somebody had stolen her idea and made a movie on it even before she wrote the first book! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The one thing that felt interesting to me in the entire film was that she disappears after reaching the infinite potential (the 100%) just like the car did in the example she demonstrates to the professors. 

So, at the end I saw it as Lucy *becoming one with the Time,* and thus turning herself infinite and forever, which I think explains her last words: *"I AM EVERYWHERE"*  - just like Time. Time is everywhere. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1.	When the crew left Earth, they reach *Endurance* in just a matter of minutes. Is *Endurance* placed so near to Earth?

2.	How did Brand know that they are dealing with the beings  (they) of five dimensions?

3.	Why did Romily die? What caused the explosion? And why was Dr.Mann trying to kill Cooper?

4.	How come NASA manufactured a Space craft that can travel into the higher dimensions without even knowing what those dimensions hold?

5.	In the 5th dimension scene (where Cooper is hanging around the bookshelf) he gives the S.T.A.Y message to Murph first. Later on, he gives her the coordinates for NASA in Binary. But those things happened the other way, no? First they stumbled upon NASA secret location and later when he was about to leave his Earth, Murph gets the S.T.A.Y message.

6.	And why did he even send the S.T.A.Y message at all? If Murph wouldve convinced him showing that message, they would have never saved the Mankind, so why did he even send the S.T.A.Y message in the first place?

7.	The data was coded into the seconds hand in the watch when Murph (young) placed the watch on the bookshelf after picking it from the floor. But only years after that day Murph (grown up) comes back to pick it, and then sees the seconds hand moving. So, has Cooper been waiting there behind the bookshelf in 5th dimension all that time for her to grow up and come for the watch? 

8.	How did Murph (grown up) suddenly realize that it was Cooper that has been her ghost all along?

9.	Tesseract gets closed and Cooper was pushed outside of the worm whole and was later on found by other Rangers. So, by the time he came out of the wormhole back into our galaxy, has his data been utilized and the whole plan A thing worked already? Because he looks to be of the same age when he wakes up in hospital on Cooper Station, and two weeks later Murph turns up as a very old woman (of some 80 plus years, but when she shouts Eureka she was may be just 35 plus.. so what has Cooper been doing all those 45 years and where did he end up all that time).

10.	 Well thats it from my side, but there are a couple of more minor doubts from my roommate: How did Cooper exist in two places at once? And how did they manage to move the entire population of Earth to another world?

Thank you, guys :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know why people thought it to be a lame quote.. It has a great depth in it, I shall try to give view point of how I saw that quote: 

The evil that arose from *strength* and *power*, when such an evil is prevailing in the world, but if none is to stand up and act against it, if everyone is thinking *weak* and *cowardly* of themselves, such a resistance to act would create more evil because it is fueling it.

In a nutshell, just imagine what would be the plight of Gotham city if Bruce Wayne would've been afraid to become *Batman* and fight it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I commute by Autorickshaws.. 

when a diesel truck or bus passes me, that weird diesel exhaust smell really bugs me.

Yes, this is the trouble... and also one more thing that really irritates the fuck out of me during such rides is the noise of the horns from all those vehicles who want me to get the fuck out of their way. (*I mean, come on, I'm trying to do good to the planet by opting for a cycle, give me some damn place to ride it.*) I had to move sideways and sideways until there is no place left for me to move anywhere. I hated all this experience, this totally removed the joy out of riding a bicycle, for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recently bought a Firefox Roadrunner Pro-V.. I decided to commute to office daily on that bike, the distance is 9KM. But only after a week's ride to the office, I felt discouraged, especailly because of the overwhelming amount of traffic I had to face. I'm from India, *the second most highly populated country on the planet.* So, that's kinda seems obvious. 

I work in corporate, and by morning 8AM onwards the traffic sky-rockets in corporate cities (I'm from Pune). InitiallyI tried riding in that traffic, but I observed that every motor vehicle's smoke is comes out onto the commuters who take longer to travel, which is me, in this case, as I had to ride very close to them all. We don't have sepearate roads for bikers in my country. 

So, I felt bad about the kind of traffic I had to ride through. I decided that this is actually bad for my health, inhaling all the pollution from the vehicles all along those 9 kilometers. 

But everyday when I come back to my flat and look at my bicycle in the parking place collecting dust, I feel really bad. This is something I'm unable to turn around in my life.

I would really like to hear about your cycling habits, so that may be I can adopt some of them and make my bike and feet feel worthy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey thank you so much for the feedback.. It is very helpful and surely didn't hurt a bit, because my main focus, as far as my "Writing" life is concerned, is not on poetry, it's basically on *fiction.* This poetry pieces are just a trail to drench my thirst, just to see if I can writing nice sounding and rhyming stuff. That's all. Apparently, I couldn't.

Anyways, talking of poetry, let me confess, I tried reading epic poetry like *Paradise Lost*, but truth be told, I never *understand* anything in those epic poetic lines, but then sometimes among them I used to find some really awesome powerful *quotes* kind-of lines, which made me keep going if only for searching more of such lines.. 

Why I'm telling you all this is because you really seem to have great knowledge on poetry related works (you even mentioned that your academics are related to this field). So I want to ask you for help. 

Please help me with an explanation on how to read epic poetry?? I mean, I literally Googled for a verse/prose translation of Paradise Lost. *How freaking weird is that* - to search for the English prose translation for a work already originally written in English itself! I mean, come on, what kind of idiot does such a thing.. I did it. Because I was unable to figure out even a single sentence clearly.. 

Now, tell me what am I supposed to do about all this?? I really want to read great epic poetry, like Paradise Lost, Divine Comedy, The Aeneid, Beowulf and etc..!! HELP.

**Note**: English is not my first language, I'm from India.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In such case, the best part would be to rather talk.. Speak in English with someone who is good at it and ask them to correct you whenever you err. As this goes on, you will not only become good at grammar but also the correctness in grammar will become a part of your sub-conscious; and with this, you will even realize and catch errors (if any) in something that you read or write.. 

When I was learning English language in my school days, we were not allowed to speak in any regional language(I'm from India). So, that is how I learned English, by talking it and correcting it whenever I erred.

Listen to audio books as well.. It will be very helpful!

Good Luck :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I too am an aspiring writer from a country where English is not the official language, India.. Luckily enough, I was able to pursue all my education in English medium all along.. 

Ok, now coming to the *Writing* part. To write a well is an art. And to create art, you ought to be *inspired..*  As you're saying that you're interested in writing, I would suggest you to recognize the kind of writing that inspires you... You should take it from the very basic level..

*Start reading quotes*, lots of quotes from lots of authors.. And I'm sure that will inspire you.. and then alongside, think back into your own past experiences that you feel are vital for your life, and try writing small quotes/sentences about them, whatever they would be, just write a sentence about it. Once you start doing this regularly, you will not only feel like writing more of them, but you will also unconsciously strive to write them more beautifully.. That's how you start recognizing the preciousness of the **art** that you possess.

And once you do that, you will automatically get to know what more to do to improve your style, flow and simplicity in putting the words together.. When you're well into such process, you will eventually build up confidence and you will know what would be the purpose of your writing.

This is what I learned by practicing writing since past 4 years.. I started with writing blogs (began with Blogger, and after all this time, recently switched to Medium.com).. At the begining, my writings had lots of grammatical errors, but after all these years, I'm able to write better, with very less grammatical errors, and above all, with a more inspired spirit in my writing.

*Note*: Read more. Once when you start reading quotes from the books, and when you stumble upon a really really really grand quote or sentence, sit back and think what would've resulted somebody in writing such a sentence.. and then try to read the book which the quote came from... This way you will understand the context behind beautiful words and sentences and believe me, you will desire to create such onces youself.

Even after doing all this, if your skill or ability as a writer doesn't change or advance, tell me, I will give you my address.. you can come and kill me! </TEXT>

**Don't be easy!**

Read books... and if you can do that you'll be proud of these two years more than any couple of years in your entire life... and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/) is where you would want to go if you pick up the habit.

(I'm not suggesting you to not watch movies at all, of course you should... all I meant was when you look back, I don't want you to have only *watching movies* as a significant pastime, that is all).

<TEXT> I'm a very newbie to R. I just found out that there are numerous datasets inbuilt into R's *datasets* package.

but when I tried to access them, I don't see anything.
For ex: when I type

data(Nile) //I have this 'Nile' dataset in the package

The data present inside it is not being visible. The prompt just goes to next line, and nothing happens. But in online examples they got the data when they typed a datasets name like: data(phones)

Any idea why am I not getting the data? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-09-20 09:53:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 1984. It is said to be a timeless classic book in English Literature..  I started it some time long ago, nearly more than a month ago and am still not able to finish it. For me it is surely not a page turner. I'm just keeping up with it still because I feel bad when I start a book and decide not to finish it, so am just trying to read it page by page and find out if I can realize why it is such a classic.

There are many instances in the plot that seemed really senseless.. Winston, Julia and O'Brien... there is no proper relation between how they develop their opinions and feelings that they have for one another.. Why Julia loves Winston and a lot more such loose ends..

Can somebody please tell me why this 1984 is a classic?? </TEXT>

<TEXT> A dystopian time period... people living by a set of strange rules and practices... the protagonist character also lives as one among them all.... and then eventually he starts thinking differently... and then a girl character enters the story and that stirs him for even more revolutionary ideas and actions that protest against those time period socially accepted customs... 

I have observed the same plot line in very well known classics Fahrenheit 451, 1984, and also a novella Anthem (by Ayn Rand)... 

Now, why is that??  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Truth be told, I'm heavily influenced by Inception film.. Ever since then, I am interested in lucid dreaming concepts.. I've tried to come up with interesting story lines... but whenever I start writing something.. After some time, inevitably I ask myself "How is this different from Inception, anyways?? Why would people want to read this when they've already seen all this in Inception?"

So I want to ask you people: Is it really possible to write a lucid-dreams fiction, whose concepts would appear new, while most of it is already covered in the Inception film in a very grand manner???

Please help me... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm reading **The Undercover Economist** by Tim Harford.. I'm a novice to economics, but am interested in learning it. So I picked up this book and am reaching its end right now. But there are many things in that book that left me in dark, many concepts seemed very unclear to me, especially the concepts like how game theory is used in auctions and lot more such things from that book. I understood some concepts very well and now am looking at those things differently in everyday reality. So, I want to also get the gist  of those concepts that I didn't understand clearly when I read them from the book. Can somebody please provide me with a link that has a detailed chapter vise summary of the book or any of your personal analyses of them?? It would be of *GREAT* help if you people can do that for me. Thank you! </TEXT>

<TITLE> 100 Day Declaration: Addiction is not at all an evil </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-26 19:10:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ive finished 100 days of abstinence and there is a specific viewpoint of mine that I want to portray today to the members of this brotherhood about the subject at hand, *the addiction.*

Along this time, Ive only, or at least mostly, seen people referring to masturbation as a completely negative thing in their lives and it ruining their vital time. People say its a demon that stops ones development in life and so should be killed. *I dont agree.* It should not be ended; it should rather be fought and conquered but never despised and killed, never; because the real meaning of victory is not killing but conquering. After all, what would we, the powerful Humans, the soldiers who man the eternal Universe residing within each of us, do if there is no worthy opponent, if there is nothing standing between us and the ambitions we carry in our hearts? You can trek to the heights and watch the horizons only when there are mountains present in your way and blocking the view. So, I say your addiction (to masturbation or anything else) is not a prison that locks you up but a gym that strengthens you; and of course strength is only enjoyable when it is tested, not when it is rested. So it tests you, it weakens you, it hits you in the face, it hits you in the heart, it provokes you to fight back, and in the process it makes you stronger, it makes you brave, it makes you familiar to the hurdles again and again in the form of ups and downs, crests and troughs, so that when you encounter greater ones ahead in your life, you dont fear them anymore. Addiction can be an ocean of pleasure; you either learn to swim it and enjoy the dive, or fall straight in and drown away into its depth; choice is yours; and in both the above cases, ocean is not to the blame. A gymnasium is presented to you but working out in there is solely your duty. Don't offend your addictions, overrun them.

After 100 days of staying away from PMO, especially masturbation, this is all Ive realized about it. I wont hate it, I cant hate it; because it gave me intense pleasure since my puberty and I cant deny that. So, I stopped seeing it as an enemy, I never saw it as an enemy, I only saw it as a competitor, as an opponent, who irks me to dare win against it. 

I started my abstinence not at all because I was an addict of masturbation, but because its very valuable and enjoyable to me and I wanted to sacrifice such blissful pleasure for a goal that I took up in my life, like leaving the joy and comfort of home and going to the war to achieve my goal. That day was the start, and today it is 100 days; and this is just the beginning. 

*Thank you all, for your unstopping support to many brothers like me here, justifying the name, a brotherhood!* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Recently there was a conservation going on with my friend about porn and masturbation and I mentioned to him that I took break from all those things. 

Friend: Why don't you masturbate?

Me: Just like that, took a break for a while.

Friend: Whatever happens won't you masturbate?

Me: No. I won't.

Friend: What if a very sexy girl comes to you? You won't fuck her? 

Me: No.

Friend: Won't you even masturbate thinking about her?

Me: No.

Friend: Why? Don't you have a dick??

Me: *I do. And I also have dignity in my dick.*




I felt very good about myself after I said. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've always had this doubt inside my mind and now I started watching Carl Sagan's **Cosmos** hence this rose again in me. Now I can't stop asking this to the world, once and for all:

When we talk about the Cosmic entities such Planets, Solar Systems, Stars, Galaxies and etc, we talk in light years.. We, the human beings never even have set foot on the farthest planet even in our own solar system, but we diligently talk of numerous Galaxies apart from our own as if we have a crystal clear knowledge of them. 

When we haven't been to any of the other planets or to any farther than our own solar system, how the hell can we say that we are this much far this this galaxy and that much far from that galaxy??

 Not just that, anything and everything that is being told about the cosmic universe by our science, how can we be so sure about it all?? For example, in the Cosmos TV Series, *Ryan Nebula* is said to be **ONLY** 1500 Light Years away from Earth.. How on earth can we even envision, sitting here on this planet, about something that requires one to travel for 1500 years at the speed of light?? 

How in the world do we know all these things? I beg for the answers!!

<TITLE> Does reading different kinds of erotica come under Porn?? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-29 17:54:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I love to read books.. and then one day, just like that, I also discovered erotica (erotic stories) and started to love the kinky ones..!! I would even go further and say that I was once addicted to them than to the actual porn.. 

Now, I'm into NoFapping.. I'm on my 70+ days without fapping. But recently, as I started exploring Reddit, I found those subreddits that are very closely related to the kind of erotica I used to read.. and was kinda into them for a couple of days on the weekend.. I broswed through lot of captioned pictures on reddit and some real life stories...

I realized this is wrong too and am again trying to keep myself away from them like I did when started NoFapping a couple of months ago, although I didn't reset my badge right now because I **did not** masturbate at all!!

So, plz tell me does reading erotica, watching related captioned pictures and feeling aroused comes under Porn?? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Are Wilco Classics (Hardcover) worthy enough to collect?? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-21 17:42:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I very recently bought 'Mein Kampf' by Adolf Hitler, published by Wilco Classics. It was a leather bound edition for a very less price, for just Rs.275 (less than $6). I was impressed by the hard binding, quality of the paper and the print. Out of curiosity I then browsed for other books from Wilco. Fortunately, I found lot of other books, all leather bound/hard cover editions and at prices even lesser than the one I mentioned above.

But to my surprise, none of the books are rated/reviewed (in Amazon). This made me wonder whether these books from Wilco Classic Library are of people's interest or not.

What do you people think of them?? Are there any particular disadvantages if one collects Wilco Classic editions?? </TEXT>
