<TEXT> I'd do a lot of the same things I'd do with a duck, it being a fatty bird. The last time I cooked through an entire duck I cooked the following:

Rendered Duck Fat (to make anything you'd need fat in--eggs, biscuits, etc)
Duck Confit (shred off the bone + add to whatever--you can even make nuggets :) or a shepards pie style dish )
Pate
Broth </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sausage making is 2 basic steps: meat grinding + casing!

To make this recipe, I ground a blend of short rib and round meat to get a 70/30 fat ratio.

Using some hog casings I bought online, I then stretched the casings over my kitckenaid sausage stuffer attachment and then stuffed the blended meat in there! </TEXT>

<TEXT> video games are highly addictive because they are psychologically gratifying--as in, you get immediate rewards and feedback constantly. to state that just because someone of one gender is immune to this mental response is unfortunately misplaced sexism. this means, if properly exposed, any girl can like games. So "hot or not" is on a case-by-case basis, just like it would be with any male gamer, which as it is easy to imagine represent all ends of the aesthetic spectrum.
