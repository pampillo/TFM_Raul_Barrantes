<TEXT> I actually really liked season 9. It wasn't the same show, but it had a lot of potential. It should have been its own spinoff, as opposed to being tacked on to the end of the original show. The first time I re-watched the whole series, I was left wanting to see more of those characters. Season 9 may not have been as good as the first 8 seasons, but it could have been. Hell, it's way better than what they tried to do with the interns in season 8. Denise was the only salvageable part of that mess. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Haha, I thought so. However, your eyes are mesmerizing, and your smile is adorable. Whatever you're doing, keep it up. Also, coming from a former fellow emo-kid, even as you grow up, people of all kinds, tend to use that to generalize you. Don't be afraid to keep them on their toes. Let them make that assumption, but throw them a curveball every once in awhile. Leaves them thinking "wow, there's much more to this girl than 'hot emo chick'" </TEXT>

Not to mention the fact that consent isn't as easy as black and white. Also, you're assuming that male rape is when a man has penal-vaginal intercourse with a woman. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sure everyone here will be saying the same thing, but fuck those people! Like what you like, and don't be ashamed of it. If you lose friends because of the music you listen to, then they aren't the kind of friends you want to keep around. OR, they may respect you for being unashamed of it, and like you more. It may even open their eyes to the genre. "Well, they like EDM, and they're cool, so maybe EDMs not so bad." Or, and this isn't recommended, but if you wanna be more passive with it, just play it off as a joke. If they catch you listening to electronic music and laugh at you, just be in on the joke. They'll laugh, you'll laugh, and you all have a good time. The best way to deal with a bully is to laugh with them, as opposed to letting them laugh at you. </TEXT>
