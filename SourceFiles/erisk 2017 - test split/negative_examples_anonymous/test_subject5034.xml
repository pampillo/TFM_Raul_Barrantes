<TEXT> It is the Supreme Court's responsibility to protect minority rights from legislation which oppresses said rights. They now set precedent to avoid anymore legislation which would infringe on gay rights. This is exactly where this should have been decided. Just like it was the right place to resolve segregation and the infringement of African American rights. That is the whole purpose of Judicial Review. To prevent oppressive legislation by the majority. Good job SCOTUS! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sproles is much older and certainly did not look better than Shady last year. That Shefter tweet about McCoy being 2nd in NFL in rushing behind Demarco weeks 5-17 last year proves that. He had a slow start, but is still a dominant back.

With that said, I still think the Eagles are the winners by being able to shed that cap hit and getting a potential stud in Alonso. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was reading the Wikipedia page on the topic, and it essentially says in the 19th century their emerged texts claiming it, but there is no primary source to confirm it.

So the question is: What, if any, proof is there of it happening. AND why in the 19th century did this begin getting written about?

BONUS: If this is true...WHY THE HELL CAN'T I SALT THOSE DAMN CARTHAGIANS IN ROME: TOTAL WAR II???? </TEXT>

<TEXT> No offense, but your comment comes off as ignorant as shit. I assume you are white? You clearly don't understand the unequal job opportunities of African Americans in ANY profession, let alone head coaching in the NFL. How many black head coaches were there prior to this rule?? It clearly is working as they are now actually seeing opportunities. It's not forcing any team to hire these individuals. Its forcing teams to actually give them a look. 

Its not like you can just "get rid of the Rooney Rule."  Racism isn't dead, and old white owners usually need to be pushed in the right direction. Sorry, for this mini-rant, it just really pisses me off when people are ignorant of the incredible struggle for equality that is still being fought for by African American coaches. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Personally I'd be thinking about the first few weeks after our wedding when we'd start talking about fetishes and sexual boundaries/secret desires and all that and I'd tell her how much I want to give her an enema. To be clear I'd want her to privately give herself an enema first so there's no scat then fill herself up with water again along with 3 movie sized bags of skittles and invite me in the bathroom, I just want her to squat over me in the bathtub so I can stare and poke at her anus as she sprays a jet of skittlewater into my mouth as I wildly jack off as the crack of wet skittles spraying off my teeth creates a machine gun sound effect, then finger her as I lick out her gaping anus as it twitches and quivers. She's a bit weirded out at this but she loves me and knows this fetish is something I've been fantasizing about since I was 12. Plus we're married and have a newborn together, what is she going to do, divorce me over this? She's more than welcome to peg me afterwards or any other fucked up fetish most guys would balk at.

That is my personal favorite.  I still can't stop laughing </TEXT>

<TEXT> Obviously everyone has different tastes in music.  Different strokes for different folks.  So I guess I will start, bands I listen to that really just rock my socks and maybe more people should have their socks rocked by: The Decemberists and Limbeck.

Both awesome, in my opinion.  What about you guys? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Hey Reddit, interested in donating some spare change to help build schools and better communities in Cambodia? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-10-04 18:03:11 </DATE>

<TEXT> Hey everyone.  I currently live and teach in South Korea and the community I live in is kicking off a fund raiser for some schools in Siem Reap, Cambodia.  I first visited Cambodia last summer and walked away awestruck and inspired.  The people of this country have many reasons to be depressed and downtrodden, yet they are not.  A mere 40 years ago Pol Pot's reign of terror and genocide tried to destroy this great country.  So many people are still so affected by this, and yet these people are amazing.  So loving, so friendly, and so much desire to better their country!  Well the fundraiser my community in SK and I are doing is simply a spare change fundraiser in which we handed out Piggy Banks to all interested people, and then told them to bring them back to us on December 16th and also decorate them in an original manner, and we would give prizes away for the best original pigs!  I was wondering if the great people of Reddit would be interested in getting in on this?  Obviously you can't send a Piggy Bank full of change, but people could keep the change in a Piggy Bank, decorate and send pictures?  Or simply just keep some change for a while and donate it.  Figured maybe Reddit wanted to do a little good for some great children and people in an amazing country!  Here are a few websites that talk about the projects I am involved with and also how to help, or how to donate.  Thanks for hearing me out.  If this pig thing is stupid for a real broad internet community, I understand, just was curious if it would work on a wide scale basis.  Cheers!

<TEXT> Where you are from is a major part of what shapes you as person.  I like America man, and I am proud of that.  I am not necessarily proud of some of the decisions our country has made and especially not proud of our healthcare system in particular.  But I know a lot of great people who would bend over backwards for just about anyone.  These aren't the people that everyone hears about, so it is a shame that the gun-toting obnoxious assholes are all people ever do hear about.  I am proud of the people around me that I saw (don't currently live in America -ironic for me to be defending it and then not living there, I know) who are great people and hardworking and are trying to help our country change for the better. I.E. protests around wall street.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh I am not proud of the American Government, heck I am not proud of many of my countrymen/women.  But I am still proud to be American as most Australians are proud to be Australian or Brit is proud to be British.  Its my identity and I wouldn't want to change my roots, I want to be proud of them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Defending your country is simply being proud of what you are.  Sure, its great to make fun of what you are and where you are from, that is funny.  But when SOMEONE ELSE pokes fun or insults where you are from, it essentially is them poking fun or insulting you.  I am American, and I make fun of some of our ineptitude, but when another insults it I will stand firm and  try and defend it,  I don't think that makes me "butthurt"  I think that makes me someone who is proud of who I am and where I am from.
Edit: spelling </TEXT>
