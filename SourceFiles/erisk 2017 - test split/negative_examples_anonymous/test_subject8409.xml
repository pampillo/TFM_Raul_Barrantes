<TEXT> Trailing dogs tracked the scent from the LKP at Bouck Street and Barker in Dannemora down to the Mobil gas station .9 miles away. From there the scent led them SE on 374 to Cadyville. The direction of travel seemed to be in a general SE direction. E on Route 3 and 374 leads to Plattsburgh, New York. There are RR tracks in Plattsburgh, New York that travel to near Friendship, New York. This makes me suspect they may have hitched a 300 mile ride on a freight car from Plattsburgh to near Friendship.

<TEXT> [**Rescission of Cuba as a State Sponsor of Terrorism**](http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2015/05/242986.htm)



#Press Statement

#Jeff Rathke

#Director, Office of Press Relations

#Washington, DC

#May 29, 2015



-

In December 2014, the President instructed the Secretary of State to immediately launch a review of Cubas designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism, and provide a report to him within six months regarding Cubas support for international terrorism. On April 8, 2015, the Secretary of State completed that review and recommended to the President that Cuba no longer be designated as a State Sponsor of Terrorism.

-

Accordingly, on April 14, the President submitted to Congress the statutorily required report indicating the Administrations intent to rescind Cubas State Sponsor of Terrorism designation, including the certification that Cuba has not provided any support for international terrorism during the previous six-months; and that Cuba has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future. The 45-day Congressional pre-notification period has expired, and the Secretary of State has made the final decision to rescind Cubas designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism, effective today, May 29, 2015.

-

The rescission of Cubas designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism reflects our assessment that Cuba meets the statutory criteria for rescission. While the United States has significant concerns and disagreements with a wide range of Cubas policies and actions, these fall outside the criteria relevant to the rescission of a State Sponsor of Terrorism designation

 **Marilyn Mosby Charges Six Baltimore Police Officers Involved in the Freddie Gray Arrest**

For Immediate Release 5/1/15

Today Marilyn Mosby, States Attorney for Baltimore City, announced charges
against six Baltimore City Police Officers for their alleged role in the death of
Freddie Gray. The States Attorneys Office conducted an independent investigation
into this matter upon receiving notice of the incident. 

The charges with the respective maximum penalties are as follows:

**Officer Caesar R. Goodson, Jr.**

*[Driver of the wagon, checked on Gray several times but never restrained him or sought medical attention when Gray reported that he needed it, according to Mosby.]*

1. Second-degree depraved heart murder (30 yrs.)
2. Manslaughter (involuntary) (10 yrs.) 
3. Assault/second-degree (gross negligence) (10 yrs.) 
4. Manslaughter by vehicle criminal negligence (3 yrs.) 
5. Misconduct in office (8th Amendment*)

**Officer William G. Porter**

*[Asked Gray at one of the stops if he needed medical attention, according to Mosby. Porter assisted Gray onto a wagon bench, but didn't restrain him or get medical assistance.]*

1. Manslaughter (involuntary) (10 yrs.)
2. Assault/second-degree (10 yrs.) 
3. Misconduct in office (8th Amendment*)

**Lt. Brian W. Rice**

*[Bike patrol officer who first chased Gray, along with Nero and Miller, according to Mosby. Gray surrendered to them and they arrested him, even though they "failed to establish probable cause" for his arrest. Mosby said no crime had been committed and the knife that Gray was carrying was legal. Rice, Nero and Miller loaded Gray into the police wagon without restraining him; they later placed flex cuffs on his wrists and leg shackles on his ankles, placing him on his stomach, head first in the wagon, without a seatbelt.]*

1. Manslaughter (involuntary) (10 yrs.) 
2. Assault/second-degree (10 yrs.) 
3. Assault/second-degree (10 yrs.) 
4. Misconduct in office (8th Amendment*)
5. Misconduct in office (8th Amendment*)
6. False imprisonment (8th Amendment*)

**Officer Edward M. Nero**

*[One of the three officers who pursued Gray. Nero and Miller handcuffed Gray and placed him in a prone position, according to Mosby. When they placed him in a seated position, they discovered a knife. Nero "physically held him down against his will" until a wagon arrived. Nero, along with Rice and Miller, loaded him into the wagon without restraining him; they later placed cuffs on his wrists and leg shackles on his ankles without a seatbelt.]*

1. Assault/second-degree (10 yrs.) 
2. Assault/second-degree (10 yrs.) 
3. Misconduct in office (8th Amendment*)
4. Misconduct in office (8th Amendment*)
5. False imprisonment (8th Amendment*)

**Officer Garrett E. Miller**

*[One of the three officers who pursued Gray, arrested and handcuffed him; Miller placed Gray in a restraining technique known as a "leg lace," then was one of three officers who loaded him into the wagon without restraining him, according to Mosby.]*

1. Assault/second-degree (10 yrs.) 
2. Assault/second-degree (10 yrs.) 
3. Misconduct in office (8th Amendment*)
4. Misconduct in office (8th Amendment*)
5. False imprisonment (8th Amendment*)

**Sgt. Alicia D. White**

 *[One of three officers who later found Gray unresponsive on the floor of the wagon, according to Mosby. White spoke to the back of his head, but when he didn't respond, she did nothing further "despite the fact that she was advised that he needed a medic," Mosby said. "She made no effort to look or assess or determine his condition. Despite Mr. Gray's seriously deteriorating medical condition, no medical assistance was rendered or summoned for Mr. Gray at that time by any officer."]*

1. Manslaughter (involuntary) (10 yrs.)
2. Assault/second degree (10 yrs.) 
3. Misconduct in office (8th Amendment*)

*Any sentence that does not constitute cruel   unusual punishment.

##From U.S. Naval Forces Central Command Public Affairs

MANAMA, Bahrain (NNS) -- The aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN 71), escorted by the   guided-missile cruiser USS Normandy (CG 60), transited the Strait of Hormuz from its station in the Arabian Gulf to the Arabian Sea, April 19. 

Theodore Roosevelt and Normandy have joined other U.S. forces conducting maritime security operations in the Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden, the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb and the Southern Red Sea.

In recent days, the U.S. Navy has increased its presence in this area as a result of the current instability in Yemen. 

The purpose of these operations is to ensure the vital shipping lanes in the region remain open and safe. The United States remains committed to its regional partners and to maintaining security in the maritime environment.

**Editorial Reviews**


A World Between is the true story of a young Iranian American raised in the United States, who travels to Iran to discover his father's homeland. His encounters take him across the country, from the teeming capital of Tehran, to the centre of Ancient Persia in Esfahan, and finally to the home of his ancestors Iran's holiest city, Mashhad. In each place we meet his friends and relatives who help form a more representative view of Iranians than we often see in the West. It is the story of one young man's experience, but it speaks volumes to all those who desire to know the place better, both westerners and Iranians living abroad. We see Iran through the narrator's eyes, that understands both Iranian and American sensibilities.

<TEXT> Thanks for a very informative comment.

Since you sound knowledgeable in this subject I'd like to ask if you know of any direct evidence (besides news reports) of an alliance between JRTN and ISIS?

I posted a comment that "the alliance between JRTN and ISIS is not confirmed" but then deleted it after getting [this response](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/32xau7/izzat_aldouri_a_member_of_the_islamic_state_of/cqfla18) </TEXT>

<TEXT> He also chillingly wrote about a list published by the al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's (AQAP) "Inspire" magazine in 2013, which identified 11 people wanted dead or alive for committing crimes against Islam.



"I find my name, badly spelled but accompanied by a photo where you can recognise my alarmed face" -- a picture he said was taken when the newspapers offices were burnt down in 2011 shortly after a special edition was published under the banner "Charia Hebdo".


"The skillful montage is titled 'YES WE CAN' and below you can read: 'a bullet a day keeps the infidel away'."

<TEXT> The odds are much less. You forget to factor the higher infant mortality rates in multiples..

The risk of infant death increases with the increasing number of
infants in the pregnancy. In 2010, the infant mortality rate for twins
(24.03) was more than four times the rate for single births (5.45). The
infant mortality rate for triplets (55.31) was 10 times, and the rate for
quadruplets (115.02) was 21 times, the rate for single births. An infant
mortality rate could not be computed for quintuplet or higher-order
births due to the small number of events in that category.

A multi-sensor camera systems with video analytic software could easily detect such threats at great distances.

Coincidentally [SpotterRF just announced today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37gpbn2MG-M) a Mobile Radar System that detects and tracks small drones.

 **White House on Proposed Lifting of Cubas Terrorism Designation**

---
    14 April 2015

    THE WHITE HOUSE
    Office of the Press Secretary
    Washington, D.C.
    April 14, 2015



    Statement by the Press Secretary on the Proposed Rescission of Cubas Designation as a State Sponsor of
    Terrorism




    Today, the President submitted to Congress the statutorily required report and certifications indicating 
    the Administrations intent to rescind Cubas State Sponsor of Terrorism designation.


    Cuba was designated a State Sponsor of Terrorism in 1982 due to its efforts to promote armed 
    revolution by organizations that used terrorism. Once designated, a country remains a State Sponsor of 
    Terrorism until its designation is rescinded in accordance with statutory criteria. In Cubas case, the
    applicable criteria require the President to submit a report to the Congress at least 45 days before the
    proposed rescission would take effect, justifying the rescission and certifying that (1) the Government
    of Cuba has not provided any support for international terrorism during the preceding 6-month period; 
    and (2) the Government of Cuba has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international
    terrorism in the future.


    As part of his December 17, 2014, announcement of policy changes related to Cuba, President Obama
    instructed the Department of State to undertake a review of Cubas designation as a State Sponsor of 
    Terrorism based on an assessment of the available facts. After a careful review of Cubas record,
    which was informed by the Intelligence Community, as well as assurances provided by the Cuban
    government, the Secretary of State concluded that Cuba met the conditions for rescinding its 
    designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism. The Secretary of State therefore recommended that the
    President make and submit to Congress the statutorily-required report and certification.


    As the President has said, we will continue to have differences with the Cuban government, but our 
    concerns over a wide range of Cubas policies and actions fall outside the criteria that is relevant to
    whether to rescind Cubas designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism. That determination is based on
    the statutory standard   and the facts  and those facts have led the President to declare his intention
    to rescind Cubas State Sponsor of Terrorism designation. More broadly, the United States will continue
    to support our interests and values through engagement with the Cuban government and people.

 **Kerry on Proposed Lifting of Cubas Terrorism Sponsor Designation**



    14 April 2015

    U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE
    Office of the Spokesperson
    Washington, D.C.
    April 14, 2015

    STATEMENT BY SECRETARY KERRY

              Recommendation to Rescind Cubas Designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism


    In December 2014, as a critical component of establishing a new direction for U.S.Cuba relations, the 
    President directed the State Department to launch a review of Cubas designation as a State Sponsor of 
    Terrorism and provide a report to him within six months. Last week, the State Department submitted a 
    report to the White House recommending, based on the facts and the statutory standard, that
    President Obama rescind Cubas designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism.


    This recommendation reflects the Departments assessment that Cuba meets the criteria established by 
    Congress for rescission. While the United States has had, and continues to have, significant concerns
    and disagreements with a wide range of Cubas policies and actions, these concerns and disagreements 
    fall outside of the criteria for designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism. This review focused on the
    narrow questions of whether Cuba provided any support for international terrorism during the previous 
    six months, and whether Cuba has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international
    terrorism in the future, consistent with the statutory standard for rescission.


    Circumstances have changed since 1982, when Cuba was originally designated as a State Sponsor of 
    Terrorism because of its efforts to promote armed revolution by forces in Latin America. Our 
    Hemisphere, and the world, look very different today than they did 33 years ago. Our determination,
    pursuant to the facts, including corroborative assurances received from the Government of Cuba and 
    the statutory standard, is that the time has come to rescind Cubas designation as a State Sponsor of
    Terrorism.

<TEXT>  Your pre-JPA link is from November 23, 2013. The JCPOA fact sheet from 2015 does not include  daily access.

 https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/04/02/parameters-joint-comprehensive-plan-action-regarding-islamic-republic-ir

The IAEA **will have regular access** to all of Irans nuclear facilities, including to Irans enrichment facility at Natanz and its former enrichment facility at Fordow, and including the use of the most up-to-date, modern monitoring technologies.

-
This makes it even more confusing.

Edit: The JCPOA fact sheet includes that Iran agrees to the Additional Protocol of the IAEA

Iran has agreed to implement the Additional Protocol of the IAEA, providing the IAEA much greater access and information regarding Irans nuclear program, including both declared and undeclared facilities.

-

This is from the text of the [Additional Protocol](https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/infcirc540.pdf)  

(i) Except as provided in paragraph (ii) below, the Agency shall give .......... **advance notice of access of at least 24 hours**; 

-

(ii) For access to any place on a site that is sought in conjunction with design information verification visits or **ad hoc** or **routine inspections** on that site, **the period of advance notice shall, if the Agency so requests, be at least two hours but, in exceptional circumstances, it may be less than two hours**.

<TEXT> Why isn't the grain for oil agreement a violation of 

`Article 3a`

1.  The import, purchase or transport of Iranian crude oil and petroleum products shall be prohibited. 

___http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02010D0413-20150214

Because they amended the UN Security Council Resolution 1929 or that was for the SAMs?


Google Translate:

Make changes to the decree on measures to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1929

**American version of Joint Plan of Action**




 Iran has agreed to reduce by approximately two-thirds its installed centrifuges. Iran will go from having about 19,000 installed today to 6,104 installed under the deal, with only 5,060 of these enriching uranium for 10 years. 

-

Iran will have 6,104 centrifuges installed, not 500 to 1,500 as Washington originally wanted as a ceiling or 4,000 as floated by U.S. officials as a possible compromise. 5,000-6,000 centrifuges is enough for a bomb but not sufficient enough to power a reactor.

Read [The odd reality of Iran's centrifuges: Enough for a bomb, not power](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/feb/25/michael-morell/odd-reality-irans-centrifuges-enough-bomb-not-powe/)

"A ten-fold increase in Irans centrifuge capacity would be required to enrich enough uranium fuel for its Bushehr reactor alone. And no matter how many more centrifuges Iran installs, it can never become self-sufficient because it does not possess adequate uranium ore reserves for a large-scale nuclear energy program."



 All excess centrifuges and enrichment infrastructure will be placed in IAEA monitored storage and will be used only as replacements for operating centrifuges and equipment.

-

Iran can keep the remaining 12,896 centrifuges. There's no clear details how they will be not allowed to access to excess centrifuges and enrichment infrastructure (The French version is more clear). Also monitoring hasn't stopped North Korea from a bomb.

-

 Irans breakout timeline  the time that it would take for Iran to acquire enough fissile material for one weapon  is currently assessed to be 2 to 3 months. That timeline will be extended to at least one year, for a duration of at least ten years, under this framework.

-

They settled for the one year nuclear breakout. Such short periods of time are very hard to monitor.   

2013 Joint Plan of Action http://eeas.europa.eu/statements/docs/2013/131124_03_en.pdf disallowed construction and enrichment at the Arak reactor

 Iran announces that it will not make any further advances of its activities at the Natanz Fuel
Enrichment Plant[1], Fordow[2], or the Arak reactor[3], designated by the IAEA as IR-40. 

-

[3] Iran announces on concerns related to the construction of the reactor at Arak that for 6 months it will not commission the reactor or transfer fuel or heavy water to the reactor site and will not test additional fuel or produce more fuel for the reactor or install remaining components

-

2015 Joint Plan of Action allows construction and enrichment

 Iran has agreed to redesign and rebuild a heavy water research reactor in Arak, based on a design that is agreed to by the P5+1, which will not produce weapons grade plutonium, and which will support peaceful nuclear research and radioisotope production.




 Kerry said on ABC's "This Week." (November 2013) disallowed Iran entirely from enrichment.

 
"There is no inherent right to enrich," 

-

2015 Joint Plan of Action allows

 Iran has agreed to only enrich uranium using its first generation (IR-1 models) centrifuges at Natanz for ten years, removing its more advanced centrifuges.

What happens after 10 years?

Obama on NPR

"Essentially, we're purchasing for 13, 14, 15 years assurances that the breakout is at least a year," 

-

 "And then in years 13 and 14, it is possible that those breakout times would have been much shorter.

(Basically as if he said let the next Presidents deal with it) 



**French version of Joint Plan of Action** (Very similar to the Iranian version.) 

Allows advanced centrifuges in contrast to the US official parameters, to continue R D work on the advanced IR-4, IR-5, IR-6 and IR-8 centrifuges, use of IR-2m and IR-4 centrifuges allowed after 12 years.


 As explained before, this enrichment does not meet Iran's needs except if they are interested in a bomb.

Edit: Stephanephoroi  ('the one who wears the crown')

http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/LEncyclopdie/1re_dition/STPHANEPHORE

Google Translate:

STPHANEPHORE, sm ( Asian antiquity .)   ; we nommoit in antiquity stphanephores , some priests and individuals pontiffs of a distinguished order, which wore a laurel wreath, and sometimes a golden crown, in public ceremonies. This priesthood was established in several cities of Asia, Smyrna, Sardis, **Magnesia Meander**, in Tarsus, and elsewhere. By the monuments we see that this dignity was annual eponymous   in some cities. The stphanophores formerly devoted to the ministry of the gods, then tied to the same cult of the emperors. We read in an inscription Tiberius-Claude Sardis, had been stphanephore , . . . ****  ; but we do not know if he was pontiff gods or emperors.

-

We also nommoit stphanephore the priest who was at the head of women in the celebration of Thesmophoria. But we nommoit ultimate stphanophore the first pontiff of Pallas, like Hercules bore the name of daduchus . Potter, Archol. Greek. tom. I. p. 206 . ( D. J .) </TEXT>

<TEXT> The US will get what it wants

The U.S. does not "get what it wants" in the current U.S. draft. Even worse in the Iranian version.

U.S. Nuclear deal



  Iran has agreed to reduce by approximately two-thirds its installed centrifuges. Iran will go from having about 19,000 installed today to 6,104 installed under the deal, with only 5,060 of these enriching uranium for 10 years. 

-

Iran will have 6,104 centrifuges installed, not 500 to 1,500 as Washington originally wanted as a ceiling or 4,000 as floated by U.S. officials as a possible compromise. 5,000-6,000 centrifuges is enough for a bomb but not sufficient to power a reactor.




 All excess centrifuges and enrichment infrastructure will be placed in IAEA monitored storage and will be used only as replacements for operating centrifuges and equipment.

-

Iran can keep the remaining 12,896 centrifuges 

-

  Irans breakout timeline  the time that it would take for Iran to acquire enough fissile material for one weapon  is currently assessed to be 2 to 3 months. That timeline will be extended to at least one year, for a duration of at least ten years, under this framework.

-

Obama's original bare minimum would have extended nuclear breakout to at least 10 years, they settled for the one year nuclear breakout.

 Kerry said on ABC's "This Week." (November 2013) "There is no inherent right to enrich." 

This is what is in the U.S. nuclear deal

 Iran has agreed to only enrich uranium using its first generation (IR-1 models) centrifuges at Natanz for ten years, removing its more advanced centrifuges.


Obama on NPR

"Essentially, we're purchasing for 13, 14, 15 years assurances that the breakout is at least a year," 

-

 "And then in years 13 and 14, it is possible that those breakout times would have been much shorter.  </TEXT>

Iranian Version
___
#Geneva, 24 November 2013

#Joint Plan of Action
___

##Preamble

####The goal for these negotiations is to reach a mutually-agreed long-term comprehensive solution that would ensure Iran's nuclear programme will be exclusively peaceful. Iran reaffirms that under no circumstances will Iran ever seek or develop any nuclear weapons. This comprehensive solution would build on these initial measures and result in a final step for a period to be agreed upon and the resolution of concerns. This comprehensive solution would enable Iran to fully enjoy its right to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes under the relevant articles of the NPT in conformity with its obligations therein. This comprehensive solution would involve a mutually defined enrichment programme with practical limits and transparency measures to ensure the peaceful nature of the programme. This comprehensive solution would constitute an integrated whole where nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. This comprehensive solution would involve a reciprocal, step-bystep process, and would produce the comprehensive lifting of all UN Security Council sanctions, as well as multilateral and national sanctions related to Iran's nuclear programme
----
####There would be additional steps in between the initial measures and the final step, including, among other things, addressing the UN Security Council resolutions, with a view toward bringing to a satisfactory conclusion the UN Security Council's consideration of this matter. The E3+3 and Iran will be responsible for conclusion and implementation of mutual near-term measures and the comprehensive solution in good faith. A Joint Commission of E3/EU+3 and Iran will be established to monitor the implementation of the near-term measures and address issues that may arise, with the IAEA responsible for verification of nuclear-related measures. The Joint Commission will work with the IAEA to facilitate resolution of past and present issues of concern.
----
####Elements of a first step The first step would be time-bound, with a duration of 6 months, and renewable by mutual consent, during which all parties will work to maintain a constructive atmosphere for negotiations in good faith. Iran would undertake the following voluntary measures:

 From the existing uranium enriched to 20%, retain half as working stock of 20% oxide for fabrication of fuel for the TRR. Dilute the remaining 20% UF6 to no more than 5%. No reconversion line.

 Iran announces that it will not enrich uranium over 5% for the duration of the 6 months.

 Iran announces that it will not make any further advances of its activities at the Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant1, Fordow2, or the Arak reactor3, designated by the IAEA as IR-40.

 Beginning when the line for conversion of UF6 enriched up to 5% to UO2 is ready, Iran has decided to convert to oxide UF6 newly enriched up to 5% during the 6 month period, as provided in the operational schedule of the conversion plant declared to the IAEA.

 No new locations for the enrichment.

 Iran will continue its safeguarded R D practices, including its current enrichment R D practices, which are not designed for accumulation of the enriched uranium.

 No reprocessing or construction of a facility capable of reprocessing.

 Enhanced monitoring:

o Provision of specified information to the IAEA, including information on Iran's plans for nuclear facilities, a description of each building on each nuclear site, a description of the scale of operations for each location engaged in specified nuclear activities, information on uranium mines and mills, and information on source material. This information would be provided within three months of the adoption of these measures.

o Submission of an updated DIQ for the reactor at Arak, designated by the IAEA as the IR-40, to the IAEA.

o Steps to agree with the IAEA on conclusion of the Safeguards Approach for the reactor at Arak, designated by the IAEA as the IR-40.

o Daily IAEA inspector access when inspectors are not present for the purpose of Design Information Verification, Interim Inventory Verification, Physical Inventory Verification, and unannounced inspections, for the purpose of access to offline surveillance records, at Fordow and Natanz.

o IAEA inspector managed access to:

  centrifuge assembly workshops4;

  centrifuge rotor production workshops and storage facilities; and,   uranium mines and mills.

 

___

Footnotes:

1 Namely, during the 6 months, Iran will not feed UF6 into the centrifuges installed but not enriching uranium. Not install additional centrifuges. Iran announces that during the first 6 months, it will replace existing centrifuges with centrifuges of the same type.

2 At Fordow, no further enrichment over 5% at 4 cascades now enriching uranium, and not increase enrichment capacity. Not

feed UF6 into the other 12 cascades, which would remain in a non-operative state. No interconnections between cascades.

Iran announces that during the first 6 months, it will replace existing centrifuges with centrifuges of the same type.

3 Iran announces on concerns related to the construction of the reactor at Arak that for 6 months it will not commission the reactor or transfer fuel or heavy water to the reactor site and will not test additional fuel or produce more fuel for the reactor or install remaining components.

4 Consistent with its plans, Iran's centrifuge production during the 6 months will be dedicated to replace damaged machines.

In return, the E3/EU+3 would undertake the following voluntary measures:

 Pause efforts to further reduce Iran's crude oil sales, enabling Iran's current customers to purchase their current average amounts of crude oil. Enable the repatriation of an agreed amount of revenue held abroad. For such oil sales, suspend the EU and U.S. sanctions on associated insurance and transportation services.

 Suspend U.S. and EU sanctions on:

o Iran's petrochemical exports, as well as sanctions on associated services.5 o Gold and precious metals, as well as sanctions on associated services.

 Suspend U.S. sanctions on Iran's auto industry, as well as sanctions on associated services.

 License the supply and installation in Iran of spare parts for safety of flight for Iranian civil aviation and associated services. License safety related inspections and repairs in Iran as well as associated services.6

 No new nuclear-related UN Security Council sanctions.

 No new EU nuclear-related sanctions.

 The U.S. Administration, acting consistent with the respective roles of the President and the

Congress, will refrain from imposing new nuclear-related sanctions.

 Establish a financial channel to facilitate humanitarian trade for Iran's domestic needs using Iranian oil revenues held abroad. Humanitarian trade would be defined as transactions involving food and agricultural products, medicine, medical devices, and medical expenses incurred abroad. This channel would involve specified foreign banks and non-designated Iranian banks to be defined when establishing the channel.

o This channel could also enable:

  transactions required to pay Iran's UN obligations; and,   direct tuition payments to universities and colleges for Iranian students studying abroad, up to an agreed amount for the six month period.

 Increase the EU authorisation thresholds for transactions for non-sanctioned trade to an agreed amount.

___

Footnotes

5 "Sanctions on associated services" means any service, such as insurance, transportation, or financial, subject to the underlying U.S. or EU sanctions applicable, insofar as each service is related to the underlying sanction and required to facilitate the desired transactions. These services could involve any non-designated Iranian entities.

6 Sanctions relief could involve any non-designated Iranian airlines as well as Iran Air.

Elements of the final step of a comprehensive solution*

The final step of a comprehensive solution, which the parties aim to conclude negotiating and commence implementing no more than one year after the adoption of this document, would:

 Have a specified long-term duration to be agreed upon.

 Reflect the rights and obligations of parties to the NPT and IAEA Safeguards Agreements.

 Comprehensively lift UN Security Council, multilateral and national nuclear-related sanctions, including steps on access in areas of trade, technology, finance, and energy, on a schedule to be agreed upon.

 Involve a mutually defined enrichment programme with mutually agreed parameters consistent with practical needs, with agreed limits on scope and level of enrichment activities, capacity, where it is carried out, and stocks of enriched uranium, for a period to be agreed upon.

 Fully resolve concerns related to the reactor at Arak, designated by the IAEA as the IR-40.

 No reprocessing or construction of a facility capable of reprocessing.

 Fully implement the agreed transparency measures and enhanced monitoring. Ratify and implement the Additional Protocol, consistent with the respective roles of the President and the Majlis (Iranian parliament).

 Include international civil nuclear cooperation, including among others, on acquiring modern light water power and research reactors and associated equipment, and the supply of modern nuclear fuel as well as agreed R D practices.

 Following successful implementation of the final step of the comprehensive solution for its full duration, the Iranian nuclear programme will be treated in the same manner as that of any non-nuclear weapon state party to the NPT.

 With respect to the final step and any steps in between, the standard principle that "nothing is agreed until everything is agreed" applies. </TEXT>

**Nuclear deal**



Iran has agreed to reduce by approximately two-thirds its installed centrifuges. Iran will go from having about 19,000 installed today to 6,104 installed under the deal, with only 5,060 of these enriching uranium for 10 years. 

-

Iran will have 6,104 centrifuges installed, not 500 to 1,500 as Washington originally wanted as a ceiling or 4,000 as floated by U.S. officials as a possible compromise. 5,000-6,000 centrifuges is enough for a bomb but not sufficient to power a reactor.

Read [The odd reality of Iran's centrifuges: Enough for a bomb, not power](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/feb/25/michael-morell/odd-reality-irans-centrifuges-enough-bomb-not-powe/)

"A ten-fold increase in Irans centrifuge capacity would be required to enrich enough uranium fuel for its Bushehr reactor alone. And no matter how many more centrifuges Iran installs, it can never become self-sufficient because it does not possess adequate uranium ore reserves for a large-scale nuclear energy program."



All excess centrifuges and enrichment infrastructure will be placed in IAEA monitored storage and will be used only as replacements for operating centrifuges and equipment.

-

Iran can keep the remaining 12,896 centrifuges 

-

Irans breakout timeline  the time that it would take for Iran to acquire enough fissile material for one weapon  is currently assessed to be 2 to 3 months. That timeline will be extended to at least one year, for a duration of at least ten years, under this framework.

-

Obama's bare minimum would have extended nuclear breakout to at least 10 years, they settled for the one year nuclear breakout.

Looks to me like a horrible deal. </TEXT>

Morell told PunditFact he said 5,000 because that was lowest number he had heard was in play. The number of centrifuges in place today is a hair over 20,000, and a likely goal is to cut that to about 5,000. But Morells basic point struck us as just plain intriguing. We wanted to learn more about this idea that a nuclear power program would require many more centrifuges than youd need for a bomb -- which by extension means that limiting centrifuge capacity is just one negotiating point out of many.

-

Bottom line: Making bombs takes fewer centrifuges. And without a lot of centrifuges, its hard to make nuclear power. For the record, some centrifuge models are better than others, so that's also a factor.

Today, Iran has just one nuclear power station, the plant at Bushehr that it bought from the Russians. To keep that facility running, Iran would need to increase its centrifuge capacity ten-fold. A steady supply of fuel from Russia is what keeps Bushehr online. </TEXT>

##### Parameters for a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action regarding the Islamic Republic of Irans  Nuclear Program
     

Washington                                                                                                   

---

###Below are the key parameters of a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) regarding the Islamic Republic of Irans nuclear program that were decided in Lausanne, Switzerland. These elements form the foundation upon which the final text of the JCPOA will be written between now and June 30, and reflect the significant progress that has been made in discussions between the P5+1, the European Union, and Iran. Important implementation details are still subject to negotiation, and nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. We will work to conclude the JCPOA based on these parameters over the coming months.

 ---

**Enrichment**



 Iran has agreed to reduce by approximately two-thirds its installed centrifuges. Iran will
go from having about 19,000 installed today to 6,104 installed under the deal, with only
5,060 of these enriching uranium for 10 years. All 6,104 centrifuges will be IR-1s, Irans
first-generation centrifuge.

 Iran has agreed to not enrich uranium over 3.67 percent for at least 15 years.

 Iran has agreed to reduce its current stockpile of about 10,000 kg of low-enriched uranium (LEU) to 300 kg of 3.67 percent LEU for 15 years.

 All excess centrifuges and enrichment infrastructure will be placed in IAEA monitored
storage and will be used only as replacements for operating centrifuges and equipment.

 Iran has agreed to not build any new facilities for the purpose of enriching uranium for 15 years.

 Irans breakout timeline  the time that it would take for Iran to acquire enough fissile
material for one weapon  is currently assessed to be 2 to 3 months. That timeline will be
extended to at least one year, for a duration of at least ten years, under this framework.

 ---
**Iran will convert its facility at Fordow so that it is no longer used to enrich uranium**



 Iran has agreed to not enrich uranium at its Fordow facility for at least 15 years.

 Iran has agreed to convert its Fordow facility so that it is used for peaceful purposes only
 into a nuclear, physics, technology, research center.

 Iran has agreed to not conduct research and development associated with uranium
enrichment at Fordow for 15 years.

 Iran will not have any fissile material at Fordow for 15 years. 
2

 Almost two-thirds of Fordows centrifuges and infrastructure will be removed. The
remaining centrifuges will not enrich uranium. All centrifuges and related infrastructure
will be placed under IAEA monitoring.

 ---

**Iran will only enrich uranium at the Natanz facility, with only 5,060 IR-1 first-generation centrifuges for ten years.**

 Iran has agreed to only enrich uranium using its first generation (IR-1 models)
centrifuges at Natanz for ten years, removing its more advanced centrifuges.

 Iran will remove the 1,000 IR-2M centrifuges currently installed at Natanz and place
them in IAEA monitored storage for ten years.

 Iran will not use its IR-2, IR-4, IR-5, IR-6, or IR-8 models to produce enriched uranium
for at least ten years. Iran will engage in limited research and development with its
advanced centrifuges, according to a schedule and parameters which have been agreed to
by the P5+1.

 For ten years, enrichment and enrichment research and development will be limited to
ensure a breakout timeline of at least 1 year. Beyond 10 years, Iran will abide by its
enrichment and enrichment R D plan submitted to the IAEA, and pursuant to the
JCPOA, under the Additional Protocol resulting in certain limitations on enrichment
capacity.

 ---

**Inspections and Transparency**

 The IAEA will have regular access to all of Irans nuclear facilities, including to Irans
enrichment facility at Natanz and its former enrichment facility at Fordow, and including
the use of the most up-to-date, modern monitoring technologies.

 Inspectors will have access to the supply chain that supports Irans nuclear program. The
new transparency and inspections mechanisms will closely monitor materials and/or
components to prevent diversion to a secret program.

 Inspectors will have access to uranium mines and continuous surveillance at uranium
mills, where Iran produces yellowcake, for 25 years.

 Inspectors will have continuous surveillance of Irans centrifuge rotors and bellows
production and storage facilities for 20 years. Irans centrifuge manufacturing base will
be frozen and under continuous surveillance.

 All centrifuges and enrichment infrastructure removed from Fordow and Natanz will be
placed under continuous monitoring by the IAEA.

 A dedicated procurement channel for Irans nuclear program will be established to
monitor and approve, on a case by case basis, the supply, sale, or transfer to Iran of 
3
certain nuclear-related and dual use materials and technology  an additional
transparency measure.

 Iran has agreed to implement the Additional Protocol of the IAEA, providing the IAEA
much greater access and information regarding Irans nuclear program, including both
declared and undeclared facilities.

 Iran will be required to grant access to the IAEA to investigate suspicious sites or
allegations of a covert enrichment facility, conversion facility, centrifuge production
facility, or yellowcake production facility anywhere in the country.

 Iran has agreed to implement Modified Code 3.1 requiring early notification of
construction of new facilities.

 Iran will implement an agreed set of measures to address the IAEAs concerns regarding
the Possible Military Dimensions (PMD) of its program.

 ---

**Reactors and Reprocessing**

 Iran has agreed to redesign and rebuild a heavy water research reactor in Arak, based on a
design that is agreed to by the P5+1, which will not produce weapons grade plutonium,
and which will support peaceful nuclear research and radioisotope production.

 The original core of the reactor, which would have enabled the production of significant
quantities of weapons-grade plutonium, will be destroyed or removed from the country.

 Iran will ship all of its spent fuel from the reactor out of the country for the reactors
lifetime.

 Iran has committed indefinitely to not conduct reprocessing or reprocessing research and
development on spent nuclear fuel.

 Iran will not accumulate heavy water in excess of the needs of the modified Arak reactor,
and will sell any remaining heavy water on the international market for 15 years.

 Iran will not build any additional heavy water reactors for 15 years.

 ---

**Sanctions**

 Iran will receive sanctions relief, if it verifiably abides by its commitments.

 U.S. and E.U. nuclear-related sanctions will be suspended after the IAEA has verified
that Iran has taken all of its key nuclear-related steps. If at any time Iran fails to fulfill its
commitments, these sanctions will snap back into place. 
4

 The architecture of U.S. nuclear-related sanctions on Iran will be retained for much of
the duration of the deal and allow for snap-back of sanctions in the event of significant
non-performance.

 All past UN Security Council resolutions on the Iran nuclear issue will be lifted
simultaneous with the completion, by Iran, of nuclear-related actions addressing all key
concerns (enrichment, Fordow, Arak, PMD, and transparency).

 However, core provisions in the UN Security Council resolutions  those that deal with
transfers of sensitive technologies and activities  will be re-established by a new UN
Security Council resolution that will endorse the JCPOA and urge its full
implementation. It will also create the procurement channel mentioned above, which will
serve as a key transparency measure. Important restrictions on conventional arms and
ballistic missiles, as well as provisions that allow for related cargo inspections and asset
freezes, will also be incorporated by this new resolution.

 A dispute resolution process will be specified, which enables any JCPOA participant, to
seek to resolve disagreements about the performance of JCPOA commitments.

 If an issue of significant non-performance cannot be resolved through that process, then
all previous UN sanctions could be re-imposed.

 U.S. sanctions on Iran for terrorism, human rights abuses, and ballistic missiles will
remain in place under the deal.

**Phasing**

 For ten years, Iran will limit domestic enrichment capacity and research and development
 ensuring a breakout timeline of at least one year. Beyond that, Iran will be bound by its
longer-term enrichment and enrichment research and development plan it shared with the
P5+1.

 For fifteen years, Iran will limit additional elements of its program. For instance, Iran will
not build new enrichment facilities or heavy water reactors and will limit its stockpile of
enriched uranium and accept enhanced transparency procedures.

 Important inspections and transparency measures will continue well beyond 15 years.
Irans adherence to the Additional Protocol of the IAEA is permanent, including its
significant access and transparency obligations. The robust inspections of Irans uranium
supply chain will last for 25 years.

 Even after the period of the most stringent limitations on Irans nuclear program, Iran
will remain a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which prohibits Irans
development or acquisition of nuclear weapons and requires IAEA safeguards on its
nuclear program.

<TEXT> ##### Parameters for a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action regarding the Islamic Republic of Irans  Nuclear Program
     

#Media Note
#Office of the Spokesperson
#Washington, DC
#April 2, 2015                                                                                                      

---

###Below are the key parameters of a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) regarding the Islamic Republic of Irans nuclear program that were decided in Lausanne, Switzerland. These elements form the foundation upon which the final text of the JCPOA will be written between now and June 30, and reflect the significant progress that has been made in discussions between the P5+1, the European Union, and Iran. Important implementation details are still subject to negotiation, and nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. We will work to conclude the JCPOA based on these parameters over the coming months.

 ---

**Enrichment**



 Iran has agreed to reduce by approximately two-thirds its installed centrifuges. Iran will
go from having about 19,000 installed today to 6,104 installed under the deal, with only
5,060 of these enriching uranium for 10 years. All 6,104 centrifuges will be IR-1s, Irans
first-generation centrifuge.

 Iran has agreed to not enrich uranium over 3.67 percent for at least 15 years.

 Iran has agreed to reduce its current stockpile of about 10,000 kg of low-enriched uranium (LEU) to 300 kg of 3.67 percent LEU for 15 years.

 All excess centrifuges and enrichment infrastructure will be placed in IAEA monitored
storage and will be used only as replacements for operating centrifuges and equipment.

 Iran has agreed to not build any new facilities for the purpose of enriching uranium for 15 years.

 Irans breakout timeline  the time that it would take for Iran to acquire enough fissile
material for one weapon  is currently assessed to be 2 to 3 months. That timeline will be
extended to at least one year, for a duration of at least ten years, under this framework.

 ---
**Iran will convert its facility at Fordow so that it is no longer used to enrich uranium**



 Iran has agreed to not enrich uranium at its Fordow facility for at least 15 years.

 Iran has agreed to convert its Fordow facility so that it is used for peaceful purposes only
 into a nuclear, physics, technology, research center.

 Iran has agreed to not conduct research and development associated with uranium
enrichment at Fordow for 15 years.

 Iran will not have any fissile material at Fordow for 15 years. 
2

 Almost two-thirds of Fordows centrifuges and infrastructure will be removed. The
remaining centrifuges will not enrich uranium. All centrifuges and related infrastructure
will be placed under IAEA monitoring.

 ---

**Iran will only enrich uranium at the Natanz facility, with only 5,060 IR-1 first-generation centrifuges for ten years.**

 Iran has agreed to only enrich uranium using its first generation (IR-1 models)
centrifuges at Natanz for ten years, removing its more advanced centrifuges.

 Iran will remove the 1,000 IR-2M centrifuges currently installed at Natanz and place
them in IAEA monitored storage for ten years.

 Iran will not use its IR-2, IR-4, IR-5, IR-6, or IR-8 models to produce enriched uranium
for at least ten years. Iran will engage in limited research and development with its
advanced centrifuges, according to a schedule and parameters which have been agreed to
by the P5+1.

 For ten years, enrichment and enrichment research and development will be limited to
ensure a breakout timeline of at least 1 year. Beyond 10 years, Iran will abide by its
enrichment and enrichment R D plan submitted to the IAEA, and pursuant to the
JCPOA, under the Additional Protocol resulting in certain limitations on enrichment
capacity.

 ---

**Inspections and Transparency**

 The IAEA will have regular access to all of Irans nuclear facilities, including to Irans
enrichment facility at Natanz and its former enrichment facility at Fordow, and including
the use of the most up-to-date, modern monitoring technologies.

 Inspectors will have access to the supply chain that supports Irans nuclear program. The
new transparency and inspections mechanisms will closely monitor materials and/or
components to prevent diversion to a secret program.

 Inspectors will have access to uranium mines and continuous surveillance at uranium
mills, where Iran produces yellowcake, for 25 years.

 Inspectors will have continuous surveillance of Irans centrifuge rotors and bellows
production and storage facilities for 20 years. Irans centrifuge manufacturing base will
be frozen and under continuous surveillance.

 All centrifuges and enrichment infrastructure removed from Fordow and Natanz will be
placed under continuous monitoring by the IAEA.

 A dedicated procurement channel for Irans nuclear program will be established to
monitor and approve, on a case by case basis, the supply, sale, or transfer to Iran of 
3
certain nuclear-related and dual use materials and technology  an additional
transparency measure.

 Iran has agreed to implement the Additional Protocol of the IAEA, providing the IAEA
much greater access and information regarding Irans nuclear program, including both
declared and undeclared facilities.

 Iran will be required to grant access to the IAEA to investigate suspicious sites or
allegations of a covert enrichment facility, conversion facility, centrifuge production
facility, or yellowcake production facility anywhere in the country.

 Iran has agreed to implement Modified Code 3.1 requiring early notification of
construction of new facilities.

 Iran will implement an agreed set of measures to address the IAEAs concerns regarding
the Possible Military Dimensions (PMD) of its program.

 ---

**Reactors and Reprocessing**

 Iran has agreed to redesign and rebuild a heavy water research reactor in Arak, based on a
design that is agreed to by the P5+1, which will not produce weapons grade plutonium,
and which will support peaceful nuclear research and radioisotope production.

 The original core of the reactor, which would have enabled the production of significant
quantities of weapons-grade plutonium, will be destroyed or removed from the country.

 Iran will ship all of its spent fuel from the reactor out of the country for the reactors
lifetime.

 Iran has committed indefinitely to not conduct reprocessing or reprocessing research and
development on spent nuclear fuel.

 Iran will not accumulate heavy water in excess of the needs of the modified Arak reactor,
and will sell any remaining heavy water on the international market for 15 years.

 Iran will not build any additional heavy water reactors for 15 years.

 ---

**Sanctions**

 Iran will receive sanctions relief, if it verifiably abides by its commitments.

 U.S. and E.U. nuclear-related sanctions will be suspended after the IAEA has verified
that Iran has taken all of its key nuclear-related steps. If at any time Iran fails to fulfill its
commitments, these sanctions will snap back into place. 
4

 The architecture of U.S. nuclear-related sanctions on Iran will be retained for much of
the duration of the deal and allow for snap-back of sanctions in the event of significant
non-performance.

 All past UN Security Council resolutions on the Iran nuclear issue will be lifted
simultaneous with the completion, by Iran, of nuclear-related actions addressing all key
concerns (enrichment, Fordow, Arak, PMD, and transparency).

 However, core provisions in the UN Security Council resolutions  those that deal with
transfers of sensitive technologies and activities  will be re-established by a new UN
Security Council resolution that will endorse the JCPOA and urge its full
implementation. It will also create the procurement channel mentioned above, which will

Dr. Cutlers Experimental Studies in
Gonorrhea report is dated October 1952. He marked it as SECRET-CONFIDENTIAL
and edited out identifying details.635 The Final Syphilis Report
is dated November 1955. **No evidence shows that the syphilis or ghonorrhea

It wasn't untill 2009 that the report was peer reviewed.  All the research (and victims) went to waste.

[**Johns Hopkins Media Statement - April 1, 2015-**](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/guatemala_study/)

Johns Hopkins expresses profound sympathy for individuals and families impacted by the deplorable 1940s syphilis study conducted by the U.S. government in Guatemala. This was not a Johns Hopkins study. Johns Hopkins did not initiate, pay for, direct or conduct the study in Guatemala. No nonprofit university or hospital has ever been held liable for a study conducted by the U.S. government. 



It has been well established by a Presidential Commission that this unconscionable research was funded and executed by the United States government. The President, U.S. Secretary of State and U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services have apologized to the Guatemalan government and to all affected.



plaintiffs essential claim in this case is that prominent Johns Hopkins faculty members participation on a government committee that reviewed funding applications was tantamount to conducting the research itself and that therefore Johns Hopkins should be held liable. Neither assertion is true.



A class action lawsuit seeking to hold federal officials responsible for the Guatemala study has been filed and dismissed. U.S. District Court Judge Reggie Walton dismissed that action in 2012 and stated that the pleas of victims for relief are more appropriately directed to the political branches of the federal government.



For more than half a century since the time of the Guatemala study, scholars, ethicists and clinicians have worked with government officials to establish rigorous ethical standards for human research. Johns Hopkins welcomes bioethical inquiry into the U.S. government's Guatemala study and its legacy. This lawsuit, however, is an attempt by plaintiffs counsel to exploit a historic tragedy for monetary gain. Plaintiffs legal claims are not supported by the facts.


We will vigorously defend the lawsuit.

[**A Letter to the Johns Hopkins Community - April 1, 2015-**](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/guatemala_study/)

**SUBJECT: Challenges from the past**
-

Dear Member of the Johns Hopkins Community,

More than 60 years ago, the U.S. government conducted an unconscionable and unethical experiment in Guatemala, in which U.S. government researchers deliberately infected vulnerable citizens of Guatemala with syphilis and other infectious diseases. We feel profound sympathy for the individuals and families impacted by this deplorable study.

When the details of this study came to light, a Presidential Commission determined that the Guatemala Study was funded and conducted by the United States government. In 2010, the President of the United States, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Health and Human Services apologized to all affected. In 2012, a federal district court concluded that the pleas of victims for relief are more appropriately directed to the political branches of the federal government.

Today, attorneys representing Guatemalan plaintiffs announced that they are suing The Johns Hopkins University and Johns Hopkins Health System, alleging that Johns Hopkins was responsible for the study. The plaintiffs essential claim in this case is that prominent Johns Hopkins faculty members participation on a government committee that reviewed funding applications was tantamount to conducting the research itself, and therefore that Johns Hopkins should be held liable. 

Neither assertion is true.

This was not a Johns Hopkins study. Johns Hopkins did not initiate, pay for, direct or conduct the study in Guatemala. Participation in the review of government research was then and is today separate from being a Johns Hopkins employee, and no nonprofit university or hospital has ever been held liable for a study conducted by the U.S. government. 

As a leading global research university, Johns Hopkins values rigorous and open scrutiny of history, even when it is complex and uncomfortable.

We know that historians have previously linked prominent Johns Hopkins faculty members in various ways to other unethical government research studies in Tuskegee and Terre Haute. Although separate from the Guatemala lawsuit, these studies were all deplorable and all demand reflection upon the broader legacy of unethical research. It is important to confront and learn from the past.  At the same time, we cannot let unfounded allegations go unchallenged. We will defend the institution vigorously in court against legal responsibility for the governments Guatemala study.

If you would like more information about the universitys position on the lawsuit, we have released a media statement that you can find here, along with information about the Presidential Commission on the research in Guatemala and its findings.

Sincerely,

-

Dr. Cutlers Experimental Studies in
Gonorrhea report is dated October 1952. He marked it as SECRET-CONFIDENTIAL
and edited out identifying details.635 The Final Syphilis Report
is dated November 1955. **No evidence shows that the syphilis or ghonorrhea
reports were provided to anyone**.636
While the results of the serological experiments were published in several
different articles,637 and the intentional exposure experiments were referred
to indirectly in later publications,638 the Commission found no evidence
that Dr. Cutlers final reports or the results of the exposure and prophylaxis
experiments were submitted for peer review or published. There are several
published examples in which Dr. Cutler discusses data from these experiments
but misleadingly cites another published study. In these cases, the
published study cited does not actually support the data presented.639 In addition,
the Guatemala experiments are notably absent from historical reviews of
STD research authored by the researchers.640
An enormous amount of money, time, and effort went into the Guatemala
experiments, and the exact motivations for hiding the results is unclear,
particularly because the VDRL researchers published widely on their research
activities, including other STD intentional inoculation

<TEXT> I tried hitting save but by that time your comment was deleted. Here it is in quoted text 

[u/Horus420I](https://www.reddit.com/user/Horus420I) know nothing about that, care to elaborate?



Most if not all of the remaining Jews' in Yemen are anti-Zionist due to the secular nature of the State of Israel . Their Rabbi has made this clear multiple times and their actions demonstrate his truthfulness. This hasn't helped them one iota and is solid proof that Houthi attacks (or any attack -  AQAP, radical etc.) are of anti-Semitic nature not anti-Zionist. 

In January 2007, Houthi (Ansar-allah) leaders threatened the Jewish families in Saada and Raida (about 400 people at the time), "We warn you to leave the area immediately... We give you a period of 10 days, or you will regret it."

The entire community fled to the capital where the President of Yemen gave the Jews protection in the Jewish quarter in Alafi Qaa, Sanna. 

The Houthis then destroyed their homes, sanctuaries, cars, took their money and property.

They took over Yemen's Jewish library which also holds many antique Jewish manuscripts and a very ancient and rare Torah scroll.

Over time most of Yemen's  remaining 400 Jews  escaped to the United States, Argentina and Israel. As of now there are only about 90 Jews left in the whole Yemen. The remaining 90 did not want to leave. Now even if they change their mind it's too late.


There were multiple incidents of hand-grenade attacks assault. Pelted by rocks, harassment and threatening SMS msgs could be expected as a daily occurrence. (I'm leaving out a few deadly AQAP inspired or radical attacks)

Two months ago two Jewish boys in Sanna were beaten by Houthis and forced to convert to Islam by praying the Shahadah (There is no god but God, Muhammad...) to their prophet Mohammed.



Just last week a few Jewish Yemenite boys tried escaping Yemen through the airport but were turned  back and badly beaten.

This is just a few attacks that I know about. There were many more.

Edit: here's an article from 2007

The description lists the location as 1000 block of South Broad Street 

View showing throngs of mourners at the **1000 block of South Broad Street** during Abraham Lincoln's funeral procession.

-
 
Mourners crowd the sidewalks as well as the rooftops and balconies of buildings and businesses, including the Union House and Dining Saloon. 

I used [Office of Property Assessment's Property Search](http://property.phila.gov/) to look up the address for the block number 1000. The results were [1000-1021 South Broad Street Philadelphia, PA](http://property.phila.gov/?_ga=1.12597108.211212269.1427738908#block/1000/South Broad Street). Assuming the block numbers are the same it would put the location at [South Broad Street between Washington Street and Carpenter St](https://www.google.com/maps/place/1020+S+Broad+St,+Philadelphia,+PA+19146/@39.938845,-75.166615,3a,52.5y,195.77h,75.21t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sCC6gDfW5c8kIsWv7UKVtKQ!2e0!4m2!3m1!1s0x89c6c617f141a127:0x6b06a6400f95f3ec!6m1!1e1).


Side note: I just noticed that the two images are of the same location. Notice the word Union on the building all the way to the right in the [first image](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2015645310/) and the words Union House and Dining Salon [in the second](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/stereo.1s04299/).

It would kind of neat if we can find other photographs from that era and confirm the location

I found another set of high-resolution copy's of the images at The Library Company of Phildelphia.

<TEXT> On 18 August 2014, the Houthis began a series of demonstrations in Sana'a against increased fuel prices. On 21 September, the Houthis took control of Sana'a, after which Prime Minister Mohammed Basindawa resigned and the Houthis signed a deal for a new unity government with other political parties. The protests were marked by clashes between the Houthis and the government and also clashes between the Houthis and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.[181] At least 340 people were killed on the outskirts of the Yemeni capital in one week of fighting between the Shiite rebels and Sunni militiamen before the city fell.[182] The new government was sworn in on 9 November, although the Houthis and General People's Congress announced they would not take part[183]

A spokesman for the Houthi group has accused Yemen's President Hadi of arming members of Al-Qaeda in the Marib province, east of the country, in order to create a new security crisis.[184]

-

The crisis intensified as Houthi militants attacked the presidential palace and private residence in January 2015, quickly seizing control of both. On 22 January, President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi and his ministers resigned.[185] The Houthis declared themselves in full control of the government on 6 February, dissolving parliament and putting a Revolutionary Committee led by Mohammed Ali al-Houthi in charge of the country.[186]

The description lists the location as 1000 block of South Broad Street 

View showing throngs of mourners at the **1000 block of South Broad Street** during Abraham Lincoln's funeral procession.

-
 
Mourners crowd the sidewalks as well as the rooftops and balconies of buildings and businesses, including the Union House and Dining Saloon. 

I used [Office of Property Assessment's Property Search](http://property.phila.gov/) to look up the address for the block number 1000. The results were [1000-1021 South Broad Street Philadelphia, PA](http://property.phila.gov/?_ga=1.12597108.211212269.1427738908#block/1000/South Broad Street). Assuming the block numbers are the same it would put the location at [South Broad Street between Washington Street and Carpenter St](https://www.google.com/maps/place/1020+S+Broad+St,+Philadelphia,+PA+19146/@39.938845,-75.166615,3a,52.5y,195.77h,75.21t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sCC6gDfW5c8kIsWv7UKVtKQ!2e0!4m2!3m1!1s0x89c6c617f141a127:0x6b06a6400f95f3ec!6m1!1e1).


Side note: I just noticed that the two images are of the same location. Notice the word Union on the building all the way to the right in the [first image](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2015645310/) and the words Union House and Dining Salon [in the second](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/stereo.1s04299/).

It would kind of neat if we can find other photographs from that era and confirm the location

I found another set of high-resolution copy's of the images at The Library Company of Phildelphia.

<TEXT>  A senior Iranian negotiator said Sunday there was no agreement yet with global powers on Iran's nuclear programme, telling AFP outstanding issues had still to be dealt with.

-
"No deal has been reached, and the remaining issues have to be resolved," the Iranian official said. Several Western diplomats have told AFP there is tentative agreement on some key parts of the emerging deal, but warned it was far from concluded.

This force could face ISIS with full power and support of Arab countries.

It's more sectarian (anti-Shia) than against terrorism.  This joint military task force was created by Sunni Arabs to defeat Iranian backed Shia Houthi rebels. Many of these countries would never directly attack  Sunni ISIS. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It seems I am being misunderstood (maybe it's my poor English). 

If I'd be looking to write in another language I wouldn't be on an English-language forum. All I wrote was that I'm more proficient in Hebrew than English. I did not write which language is my mother-tongue. In fact it is not Hebrew as you assumed. My only disagreement is (if there is any) in quoted Hebrew text. It seems people downvote any Hebrew text regardless if it's written by the OP or it's a quote from the original text. And it seems even after a request for translation is fulfilled it's ignored...  

So my question is do they truly want it translated? If yes, why downvotes and no interaction after translation. If no, why downvotes on the qouted Hebrew text.

If the OP quoted Maimonides in its original Arabic text would he/she be downvoted? I doubt it. It's telling.. </TEXT>

Please understand, it's very hard and time consuming to translate Hebrew text to English, even harder Hebrew scholarly text. It's not a simple task. 

When someone **does** offer their time and effort I'd expect the community to show their appreciation by interacting or at least upvoting the comment.

I believe this is not the case (I'm pretty new to Reddit and /r/Judaism and may be wrong with my assumption).

Look at it this way; Here I am on Reddit writing in English, a language which I am less proficient than Hebrew, while you are more advantaged in your English language skills. Should I complain? No, my poor grammar is nothing but my own fault not yours. Same should be when someone writes some Hebrew or Jewish phrases and concept..

**The minuscule discomfort that you may experience from repeatedly asking for translations is by far outweighed by the effort put in to the translation.** 
 
I think it's a very cheap and selfish complaint. Ask and you will be answered.
 
**Also, explain why someone should put in this extreme effort if their hard work is not properly appreciated?**

Here's an example of a comment with Hebrew/Jewish phrases and concepts [[1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/2zapfj/do_jews_believe_in_original_sin/cpiekr6) [[2]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/2zapfj/do_jews_believe_in_original_sin/cpi1877), both downvoted to **0**


[I was then asked to explain in English](https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/2zapfj/do_jews_believe_in_original_sin/cpieaof), [which I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/2zapfj/do_jews_believe_in_original_sin/cpieaof), no upvotes or further interaction..

**Is this fair?** **Do you think this encourages more translations?**

Edit: My only disagreement is (if there is any) in quoted Hebrew text. It seems people downvote any Hebrew text regardless if it's written by the OP or it's a quote from the original text. And it seems even after a request for translation is fulfilled it's ignored...  

So my question is do they truly want it translated? If yes, why downvotes and no interaction after translation. If no, why downvotes on the qouted Hebrew text.

If the OP quoted Maimonides in its original Arabic text would he/she be downvoted? I doubt it. It's telling.. </TEXT>

One may cut the Tzitzit strings to shorten them after they are tied to the garment (Rama, 11:4); however, **one should preferably not cut them with a metal instrument**, but rather with his teeth or other non-metal instrument (Mishna Berura 11:61).

The Shulchan Aruch (11:14) records such a practice, and the Rama (11:3) advises that this be done. The Mishna Berura (11:18), however, cites opinions forbidding tying knots at the end of the Tzitzit strings, and rules that one should refrain from doing so if the strings are properly woven such that unraveling is unlikely to occur.

<TEXT> does say in the torah that is say you must hate them?

No. The Torah predates Islam.

This is what [Maimonides](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides) -    (1135c.-1204) wrote about Islam


Muslims are not idol worshipers at all, it has ceased to exist in their mouths and hearts, and they attribute the proper oneness to God with no blemish. 

Because they lie about us, and falsely accuse us of saying God has a son (did Maimonides mean Uzayr - Ezra http://quran.com/9/30 ?), it does not mean we can lie about them and say they are idol worshipers 

And if someone should say that they worship in an idolatrous shrine [the Kaaba], and an idol is hidden inside which their ancestors worshiped  this does not matter. 

The hearts of those who bow down toward it today are directed to Heaven [towards God] 

Regarding the Muslims today, all of them including women and children have ceased to believe in idolatry.

Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The last hour would not come unless the Muslims will fight against the Jews and the Muslims would kill them until the Jews would hide themselves behind a stone or a tree and a stone or a tree would say: Muslim, or the servant of Allah, there is a Jew behind me; come and kill him; but the tree Gharqad would not say, for it is the tree of the Jews.

Found this gem online..

What makes these deaths even more stupid is that she wasn't even doing it to comply with Jewish tradition, but to make a mockery of it. Her children are dead purely because she tried to weasel her way around the prohibition against melakhah instead of either following it or ignoring it entirely.

 Leaving hotplates on for a day at a time though

The Jewish Sabbath started at around 7 pm in New York and the news reports state the fire was at 12 am, meaning the hot-plate was on for less then 6 hours. This tragic event was caused by an electronic malfunction not overheating from overuse.  Using a tragedy as a platform for hate is despicable. C'mon, at least wait an till they bury their dead..

<TEXT> 31. Three bodies were found on the lower shelf of storeroom A-111 clad in blues and jerseys. This storeroom was open to fresh water pump room, A-109, which presumably was the battle station assigned to these men. The emergency rations at this station had been consumed and a manhole to the fresh water tanks below the pumps had been removed. A calendar which was found in this compartment had an **"X" marked on each date from December 7, 1941 to December 23, 1941 inclusive**.

It was a very difficult  salvage job and took time.


* a. Install a cofferdam patch over torpedo damage on the port side at frame 43-52. 

* b. Install a cofferdam patch over the damage to midship area, port side, frame 61 - 97.

* c. Isolate steering engine room area by watertight doors.

* d. Pump out the vessel, using about ten large pumps (10") to gain control over the inflow of water.

* e. After gaining control, stop off leaks into the hull and improve tightness of patches, watertight doors, watertight covers, etc.

* f. Apply Air pressure to tanks and voids on the port side to empty or partially empty those that were ruptured. 

* g. Pump out all intact tanks and voids on the port side and empty starboard tanks and voids correspondingly.

* h. Apply air pressure to flooded areas aft in order to reduce the amount of water in those areas.

* i. Remove all weight possible, such as water, oil, stores, provisions, meat, ammunition, personal belongings, 
furniture, trash, wreckage, etc.

-

The above is in general the story of the salvage of the West Virginia, **which may well be designated as a most difficult successfully completed**. All hands assigned to the work performed their part intelligently, co-operatively and effectively. A successful outcome was never in doubt.

<TEXT> having sarin and using are two totally different things


Not according to International law. It doesn't have to be weaponized to be considered illegal.

"The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the implementing body of the Chemical Weapons Convention, classifies sarin under Schedule 1, a class reserved for lethal chemicals with few, if any, legitimate, applications."

-

The sarin Tokyo subway attacks killed only a dozen people despite it being released in a confined location with high purity

They were amateurs and were rushed and you are wrong on your assumption that it was high purity.

-

"Fortunately, the low purity of the sarin solution used in the March 20, 1995 attack and the crude delivery method reduced the number of casulties, and the presence of the pungent solvent acetonitrile allowed many commuters to detect the presence of the otherwise odorless nerve agent and flee the scene before absorbing a lethal dose. The use of plasctic bags containing the sarin mixture rather than the far more efficient method of aerosol dispersal also reduced the number of casualties... The death toll could have been far worse if the cult had had the time to prepare the attack."

-

Sadam used sarin against Iranian soldiers causing tens of thousands of casualties. Also some 3,200 to 5,000 Kurds were killed.



Well thank god the iraqis didnt weaponize fishing boats and have them shot out of cannons..

-

You wrote


even unexploded bombs from ww1. The difference is these couldnt be used for anythign 

suggesting Sadam's WMDs were less lethal then WWI munitions. 

I brought proof that mustard gass from WWI was still active in 2010, that it has a long shelf life. Sarcasm will not diminish the truth

You do realize that any attempt to shoot a rusting shell would cause said shell to explode in the barrel of the artillery piece, right?

Like I wrote before, the possession of the chemical agent is illegal whether it's weaponized or not. 

Had you read the report you'd know that some shells were still in good condition 

Also it is easy to refill a new shell or convert it to a crude bomb </TEXT>

<TEXT> Iraq has a lot of grownups capable of making decisions

And they made one...

Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Malaki practically begged Obama for several thousand military personnel to remain, to train Iraqi forces and to help track down insurgents. But he stated that the Status of Forces Agreement that gave US soldiers immunity from prosecution under Iraqi law was unpopular in Iraq (especially in light of the reveal of abuses by US military contractors etc. of Iraqi citizens rights) . Obama wouldn't agree and decided pull all troops from Iraq.

 It's not up to the US who runs Iraq

That's not the reason why Obama pulled the troops from Iraq. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are many tales in Iraqi and Muslim culture of the Tigris River turning red with blood.

Here's some

In 1258 Mongols under the command of Hulagu Khan sacked Baghdad, destroying the House of Wisdom, the leading library in the leading intellectual center of the Arab world.

The House of Wisdom, founded in the eighth century, contained countless precious documents accumulated over five hundred years. Survivors said so many books were thrown into the river that the waters of the **Tigris** ran black with ink; others said the **waters were red from blood**.

-

Khalid ibn al-Walid at the [Battle of Mu'tah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalid_ibn_al-Walid)

....Then Khalid raised his hands in supplication and prayed to Allah:

"O Lord! If You give us victory, I shall see that
no enemy warrior is left alive **until their river runs with
their blood!**" 2

The Muslims renewed their assaults with greater fury; and Allah gave them victory. Early in the afternoon the imperial army was shattered and its soldiers fled from the battlefield. Thousands lay dead, especially in, and on the bank of, the river whose sandy bed was red with their blood.

As the Persian army fled from the battlefield, Khalid launched his cavalry after it. "Do not kill them", he ordered the cavalry. "Bring them back alive." 3 The bed of the river was soaked with blood ... but the river was not "running with blood" as Khalid had pledged!



1. Tabari: Vol. 2, p. 561.
2. Tabari: Vol. 2, p. 561.
3. Ibid.....

-

....Furthermore, to call what happened a "killing of prisoners" is an oversimplification. Normally they would have been killed in the pursuit, as had happened before and would happen again, with no questions asked. In this battle Khalid had pledged to make the river run with blood, so those thousands of men, instead of being killed in the pursuit, were brought to the river and killed. And that is all that there is to the episode of the River of Blood....

Not when it's filled. Some were.


Since May 2004, Coalition forces (CF) have recovered at least 501 pre-1991 Gulf War Iraqi chemical weapons - including 448 122mm al Borak rocket warheads, **many of which contain the nerve agent sarin** (GB). 

From May 2004 until March 2009, Coalition forces recovered 4573 **filled** and unfilled pre-1991 Gulf War Iraqi chemical munitions. The recovered munitions consisted of bombs, artillery projectiles, and rockets designed to be filled with sulfur mustard, sarin, or binary sarin

-

(U) The expected potential hazard effects areas resulting from attacks utilizing pre-Gulf War Iraqi chemical weapons depends primarily on the type and number of munitions, percent fill, and agent purity

(U) NGIC has conducted detailed consequence asessments on several scnarios involving the use of pre-Gulf War Iraqi chemical weapons (see table below).

Wrong.

In 2010, a clamming boat pulled up some old artillery shells of World War I from the Atlantic Ocean south of Long Island, New York. Multiple fishermen suffered from skin blistering and respiratory irritation severe enough to require their hospitalization.

  "[/u/yummyluckycharms](https://nu.reddit.com/user/yummyluckycharms) **Furthermore, much of the ammo rounds that they found were so old, they dated back to the Iran/Iraq war and couldnt be used**"

There were mustard gas and binary sarin which have a long shelf life.

<TEXT> Devarim - Deuteronomy - Chapter 28:6

You shall be blessed when you come, and you shall be blessed when you depart.

The Talmud in Bava Metzia 107a says, the way you 'depart' from the world should be like the way you 'come in' to the world, just like you 'come in' to the world **without sin** (blessed), so too your 'departure' from the world [should be] without sin (blessed)

but that does not seem related to adam and eve.

The Talmud seems to imply that people are not born with deficiency's from prior sins including Adams

But like I brought before, the Tchebiner Rabbi has a different interpretation for the Talmud in Bava Metzia 107a

Superficially this text seems to imply that one can't come in to this world with sin

There's a famous RaShaSh on this

   

(This RaShaSh is very controversial and some believe it's a forgery)

The [Tchebiner Rov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dov_Berish_Weidenfeld) refutes this and argues that the  passage actually is proof that one CAN come in to this world with sin

What..

A bipartisan probe is being launched by a U.S. Senate Investigatory committee, designed to look into the funding of a not-for-profit group that has been trying to oust Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

-

New Israel Fund and its social change and political lobbying organization - known as SHATIL - have received more than $1 million from the State Department under a program designed to create political change, reform, and activism in the Middle East.

-

 OneVoice Movement, a group in Washington which has received $350,000 from the State Department. Until recently the group was headed by a veteran diplomat from the Clinton years.

-

A subsidiary of OneVoice is the Israel-based Victory 15 campaign, itself guided by top operatives of Obamas White House runs, which seeks to replace the government of Israel.

-

Jeremy Bird, Obamas previous campaign director, arrived in Israel to help direct V15, which was trying to reach a million households in an effort to remove Netanyahu. OneVoice is prohibited from directly targeting Netanyahu, but its Israeli partner V15 can carry out the campaign. </TEXT>

Update regarding shooting death of Ahmed Al Jumaili in North Dallas:

I had an opportunity to meet with the family of Ahmed to discuss the incident that led to his death last night. 

Imam Shpendim Nadzaku and Attorney Shayan Elahi accompanied me in the 2 meetings we held. May Allah reward both of them. Their support was invaluable. Here is what we learned:

-Ahmed Al Jumaili, 36, just immigrated from Iraq 20 days ago

 - The perpetrators were 5-6 young AfAm males

 - The shot that killed Ahmed entered the side of a pickup truck bed and cleared through the other side striking Ahmed in the chest as he hid behind the truck. *see picture*

- There was nothing said to Ahmed or his wife and her brother by the perpetrators in advance of the shots. Including no verbal insults or derogatory slurs.

- They do not wear clothing that would indicate their ethnic or religious identity and Ahmed's wife, Zahra, was wearing a winter hat that concealed her hijab.

- The family is understandably traumatized and is in need of community support. Emotionally as well as financially. They are refugees from Iraq and only Mohamed, Zahra's father, is working.
After meeting with them I do not believe there is enough evidence to indicate that this was a hate crime. Thanks to Sana Syed, the PIO and our contact for the City of Dallas, I was able to speak with Major Jeff Cotner with DPD Homicide and here is what I learned:

- They have not completely ruled out a hate crime but the evidence does not indicate Ahmed was specifically targeted.

- The perpetrators have not been caught but they have some concrete leads. If anyone is interested in sponsoring a reward to help find these murderers they would be interested to discuss.

- They need the community's help is submitting information that could lead to the arrests.

In my assessment I truly believe that the DPD is doing everything they can to solve this crime completely. We have exchanged contact info and he was very grateful for our support.

Attached is an image of the bullet exit hole that left the truck and struck Ahmed in the chest resulting in his death as well as a lovely picture of Ahmed and his wife Zahra.

"Inna Lillahi wa Inna Lillayhi Raja'oon - Verily we are from God and to Him we shall all return." Please pray for this family. This death was so violent and traumatic. We should rally around them in this difficult time.
Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns that I may help with.

Apparently Yemenite girls DO wear Hijab head coverings and many even wear Niqab/Burqas. 

Do a simple Google image search for [Yemen + Girl](https://www.google.com/search?q=Yemen+girl sa=X biw=1600 bih=775 tbm=isch tbo=u source=univ ei=QbgCVZupAcaZNpa6guAK ved=0CC8Q7Ak). 

Interestingly, this is not exclusively a Muslim practice, Yemen's last remaining Jews also dress like this.

<TEXT> In case anyone is interested.

It wasn't until December 1944 that the sinking of the Musashi was confirmed through prisoner interrogation. 

From World War II War Diaries. [Image (last paragraph)](http://imgur.com/uYgFaDq) 

Reports of prisoners of war interrogation on the South-west Pacific indicated that the MUSASHI, new Japanese battleship, had been definitely sunk in the Sibuyan Sea by THIRD Fleet carrier attck on 24 October. The reports also confirmed previous sinking claimed by the Commander THIRD Fleet and confirmed extensive damage to the remain-ing Japanse battleships which were now either in navy yards under repair or operating at reduced efficiency.

**Julie Sheldon, who swam at 9 weeks, now plays under water at 19 months**

-

In 1953, when she was only 10 days old, Julie Sheldon of Los Angles was taken into a pool by her grandmother, Mrs. Jen Loven,  and given her first swimming lesson. At 9 weeks (left), already established as the youngest swimmer in the world, Julie could swim for distances up to 10 feet as her grandmother walked closely behind (LIFE, Jan 18, 1954).

-

Today, an accomplished swimmer of 19 months, Julie has also become an underwater baby. In the outdoor pool on Hollywood Boulevard where her grandmother keeps toys resting on the bottom in the 4-foot depth, Julie submerges for as long as seven seconds and intently plays with everything from a tricycle (above) to a teet-totter.

<TEXT> **What were Bone Records?**



Bone records, or roentgenizdat, were music recordings on an unlikely medium: discarded x-ray plates. During the Second World War in Eastern Europe, vinyl became an extremely expensive way of producing records. Therefore, during the 1930s and 40s, the lack of available materials caused both labels and individual music enthusiasts to search for new ways of production. Music became available on all types of wax and film, but most notably photographic film and x-ray plates. The plates were favored because of their thicker density.


Demand only grew in the USSR in the 1950s when records and tape recorders were in increasingly short supply and music was growing as a necessary escape from political tension. Young people in Eastern Europe realized that they could duplicate records using a converted phonograph and create an imprint of a record on discarded x-ray plates. Used x-ray plates could be purchased for next to nothing from hospitals and medical facilities once they were no longer needed. Then they could easily be cut into discs with scissors. Altered phonograph machines using wax disc cutters and machines like the voice-o-graph could produce grooves in the film that were nearly undetectable. Soviet society promoted science and technology and search of knowledge. It was often students who were studying engineering who would be the ones creating these records.
Termed rock on bones (rok na kostiakh) or rock on ribs (rok na rebrakh), the records became a visual symbol for underground Soviet resistance and rebellion. The quality of these bone records was not very good at all, but the price was right. They were rather flimsy and would warm and break easily, but they would only cost a ruble or two.
In 1950s Russia, women usually controlled the family budget. On a days lunch or drink allowance, one could purchase an underground pressing. Better quality recordings would require a week or twos worth of allowance.

**Music Censorship in the Soviet Union**

In the years after World War Two, Stalin tried to get rid of any American influence on Soviet civilization. His first target in the 1950s was American jazz music. Artists like John Coltrane and Thelonius Monk were never to be heard by Soviet ears.
Jazz music turned to rock-and-roll and Bill Haleys 1954 Rock Around the Clock was deemed a threat to civilization. The x-ray press system was discovered by the Soviet government in 1958 and was promptly made illegal. The same was true for the samizdat, which was the self-publishing means for writers.
In 1962, a Soviet paper in Lithuania said of the Beatles and Elviss music: These pearls of Western culture are part of an imperialist state policy corrupting the masses, promoting low animal instincts, and dulling the mind. Similarly, in 1961, an East German newspaper said that Chubby Checkers Twist was being used by imperialists in West Germany to rally the young people for war.
It wasnt only the records that were censored by the Soviet government  rockbands were disbanded and rock concerts were raided. A task force of music patrols was started by the government in 1959 to control illegal music activity and the largest ring of roentgenizdat production was broken up the same year.

-

**Melodiya**

Melodiya, the only official record label of the USSR, was founded in 1964. Melodiya produced mainly classical music and recordings of famous actors, as well as records with fairy tales for children. Melodiya had firm policies against protest rock. They later produced records of many of the pop and rock artists of the 60s and 70s, but not until years after they were originally released, and at an extremely high mark-up. Melodiya was state-owned until the fall of the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989.

-

**Government Response**


The Soviet government attempted to flood the market of bone records by creating unplayable records in an effort to kill the demand. They would either make records that would physically mess with players, or the would include vocal recordings in the middle of the music saying things like, You like rock and roll? F**k you, anti-Soviet slime! There were about 10 individuals who were suspected of distributing bone records who were sent to the gulags (the Soviet labor camps).

-

**The Music**

The most popular productions were Western artists  from early jazz to the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and David Bowie. Soviet rock artists such as Yuri Shevchuk ran into problems with the KGB. Melodiya produced an official record by the band Aquarium that was only approved by the label as a reaction to Western concerns in USSR censorship.

-

**Death**

The two main factors in the disappearance of bone records were the government reconciliation and the replacement technologies. As reel-to-reel tape recorders gained in prevalence in the 1970s, they were able to successfully replace the system of x-ray recordings. The x-ray records had an extremely poor sound quality and were produced by select individuals. Tape recorders provided a better quality with easier and neater production. One source called tape recorders the Bit Torrent of the 1970s. At the end of the Cold War, during the perestroika era of restructuring in the USSR, censorship of music lightened up and the need for underground production of music died.

X-ray records were metaphors par excellence of imaginary elsewheres  the ingenious experimental cultures that were both internal and external to the body of the Soviet state  Alexei Yurchak, Everything was forever, until it was no more: the last Soviet generation

<TEXT> Made a mistake. He's listening to a recording not having doing a voice recording.

Title from information supplied by American Folklife Center staff. Title was formerly "Piegan Indian, Mountain Chief, having his voice recorded by ethnologist Frances Densmore," but American Folklife Center staff determined that the photo shows a playback horn on the cylinder recorder, so Mountain Chief and Densmore are listening rather than recording (12/2013).

<TEXT> The tragic death of Ahmed al-Jumaili had nothing to do with Islamophobia.  Does Max Fisher do any research before publishing things?

Assalamu Alaikum

Update regarding shooting death of Ahmed Al Jumaili in North Dallas:

I had an opportunity to meet with the family of Ahmed to discuss the incident that led to his death last night. 

Imam Shpendim Nadzaku and Attorney Shayan Elahi accompanied me in the 2 meetings we held. May Allah reward both of them. Their support was invaluable. Here is what we learned:

-Ahmed Al Jumaili, 36, just immigrated from Iraq 20 days ago

 - The perpetrators were 5-6 young AfAm males

 - The shot that killed Ahmed entered the side of a pickup truck bed and cleared through the other side striking Ahmed in the chest as he hid behind the truck. *see picture*

- There was nothing said to Ahmed or his wife and her brother by the perpetrators in advance of the shots. Including no verbal insults or derogatory slurs.

- They do not wear clothing that would indicate their ethnic or religious identity and Ahmed's wife, Zahra, was wearing a winter hat that concealed her hijab.

- The family is understandably traumatized and is in need of community support. Emotionally as well as financially. They are refugees from Iraq and only Mohamed, Zahra's father, is working.
After meeting with them I do not believe there is enough evidence to indicate that this was a hate crime. Thanks to Sana Syed, the PIO and our contact for the City of Dallas, I was able to speak with Major Jeff Cotner with DPD Homicide and here is what I learned:

- They have not completely ruled out a hate crime but the evidence does not indicate Ahmed was specifically targeted.

- The perpetrators have not been caught but they have some concrete leads. If anyone is interested in sponsoring a reward to help find these murderers they would be interested to discuss.

- They need the community's help is submitting information that could lead to the arrests.

In my assessment I truly believe that the DPD is doing everything they can to solve this crime completely. We have exchanged contact info and he was very grateful for our support.

Attached is an image of the bullet exit hole that left the truck and struck Ahmed in the chest resulting in his death as well as a lovely picture of Ahmed and his wife Zahra.

"Inna Lillahi wa Inna Lillayhi Raja'oon - Verily we are from God and to Him we shall all return." Please pray for this family. This death was so violent and traumatic. We should rally around them in this difficult time.
Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns that I may help with.

While getting ready to fish for porgy several miles offshore, A. L. Kahn, a manufacturer, tossed an anchor from his small motorboat. The anchor went down and down - and right into one of the gills of the giant Manta. After a battle of several hours a coast guard vessel came along and hoisted Kahn, his motorboat and the devil-fish aboard and brought them to port. Kahn (now Captain Kahn) **had the creature stuffed** and became a showman. Says it beats the manufacturing business all hollow.

<TEXT> He is mistaken. **A. L. Kahn had the captured manta stuffed and hung it up for exhibition.**


This appeared in many newspapers in 1933-1934

But the star of the exhibition is a local luminary - a 5,000-pound devil fish that proves New York's most amazing fish story.

While getting ready to fish for porgy several miles offshore, A. L. Kahn, a manufacturer, tossed an anchor from his small motorboat. The anchor went down and down - and right into one of the gills of the giant Manta. After a battle of several hours a coast guard vessel came along and hoisted Kahn, his motorboat and the devil-fish aboard and brought them to port. Kahn (now Captain Kahn) **had the creature stuffed** and became a showman. Says it beats the manufacturing business all hollow.

A Giant Manta Devil Fish became entangled in the anchor rope of Captain A. L. Kahns fishing boat while he was angling just off the shore of New Jersey, almost capsizing the heavy boat.
A Coast Guard vessel came to the rescue, and killed the 5,000-pound monster Manta Birostris with 22 shots from a high-powered rifle. The sail-like fish has been mounted and placed on exhibition by Captain Kahn.
An 18-inch baby Manta was born shortly after the mother fish was dragged ashore. These huge rays are seldom seen, since they live in the deepest parts of the sea.

GREAT MANTA, Brielle, NJ  1933 GREAT MANTA, Brielle, NJ  1933
This signed photo postcard shows "THE GREAT MANTA" that was captured by Captain A.L. Kahn on August 26, 1933. The huge ray was reported to have weighed over 5,000 pounds and measured more than 20 feet across the wing. The critter was caught when it became fouled in the anchor line of the "MISS PENSACOLA II" and was unable to free itself. The ray was towed to Feuerbach and Hansen's Marina in Brielle, New Jersey where it was hoisted ashore with a travel lift.

This appeared in many newspapers in 1933-1934

But the star of the exhibition is a local luminary - a 5,000-pound devi fish that proves New York's most amazing fish story.

While getting ready to fish for porgy several miles offshore, A. L. Kahn, a manufacturer, tossed an anchor from his small motorboat. The anchor went down and down - and right into one of the gills of the giant Manta. After a battle of several hours a coast guard vessel came along and hoisted Kahn, his motorboat and the devil-fish aboard and brought them to port. Kahn (now Captain Kahn) **had the creature stuffed** and became a showman. Says it beats the manufacturing business all hollow.

So this photo is the stuffed version of the real manta that he captured and exhibited.

Here's photos of what's in The British Museum

There's a Colossal statue of a winged human-headed bull from the North-West Palace of Ashurnasirpal II in The British Museum and its partner is now in the Metropolitan Museum, New York.

see

The  colossal statue winged bull you see being destroyed with sledgehammers  in the ISIS video looks to me like a duplicate.

Pro ISIS Asawitiri media's 104th Twitter account was just suspended. Shutting them down doesn't do much except make a few armchair twitter anti-jihadists feel good about themselves for mass reporting. 

I don't know how they got the number 46,000.

This leaves the 92,000 Palestinians who worked for Israelis and had a 55% average increase in salary over their peers in the Palestinian territories  at risk of losing their jobs.

It's hard for me to comprehend the sick logic behind this .

Just now I read on twitter that a PA Official was quoted as saying

"The decision to suspend security coordination with Israel was not taken by the Palestinian Authority and is just a **recommendation**"

The [agreement](http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_25457.htm) cites, 

NATO vows to respect Ukraine's sovereignty, i.e. not to invade it, and it's member states will "consult together" if the country is threatened.

It would be a non issue 'if' American troops were involved in protecting Ukraine's sovereignty. While Russia must abide to the NATO vows and not attack Ukraine's sovereignty. This is why on 1 April 2014, NATO decided to suspend practical co-operation with Russia. </TEXT>

92,000 Palestinians disagree with you. They worked in Israels private sector until now and were happy with it. The decision to stop security cooperation's with Israel is PLO politics.  

Israeli government 

Most if not all work in the private sector

whom withholds $100,000,000 in tax revenue

Although I disagree with Israels practice, Hamas has 209.7 million dollars of electricity payments taken from Palestinians that rightfully belong to Israel's electricity company

thus punishing millions of people.

It's mostly Hamas who is punishing the people

<TEXT> Cattle walking the last mile to this slaughterhouse are treated to this dazzling, but incongruous display of light before the end in Gross-Umstadt near Darmstadt, West Germany, on November 29, 1962.

<TEXT> including the Wikipedia page on Nemtsov

I couldn't find anything about this alleged affair on his [English Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Nemtsov)

Quote from pro-Russia writer you linked
 
Back then, the opposition believes, the leak was organized by the FSB security service and was directed at Mr. Nemtsov to discredit the politician.

Who trusts information originating from anonymous FSB/KGB leaks?


This is the narrative [Russian-bots  tried spreading on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ASLuhn/status/571479498560028672) right after his death.

"Ukrainians killed him...he was stealing one of their girlfriends" 

Here's a screen-grab http://imgur.com/P9iyQrk

Question. - Was it ["rain washed away all usable traces of the Nemtsov murder"](https://twitter.com/WashingtonPoint/status/572093991086374912) or did workers [power-wash the Moscow sidewalk](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/02/28/article-urn:publicid:ap.org:53ebc6cafbac431d9329c976a561f459-6WggR6hpV-HSK1-988_634x422.jpg) where Nemtsov was gunned down to deliberately remove all usable traces?

<TEXT> That's a very slanted hit piece

From [buzzfeed](http://www.buzzfeed.com/miriamelder/new-york-observer-stands-by-journalist-who-smeared-kremlin-f#.ip327m7z0q)

The New York Observer is standing by a reporter who has written more than a dozen articles for the outlet with a **slavishly pro-Kremlin bent**, the most recent a story **with no sources** that blames the murder of opposition leader Boris Nemtsov on his love life.

-

The reporter, Mikhail Klikushin, has written 15 articles for the outlet since November 2014, according to the Observers website. **He has no online presence  in English or Russian  beyond the stories he has written for the Observer**, which have also been picked up by other outlets. **A Nexis search turns up no public record of Klikushin**.

-

**Klikushins 15 articles are remarkable in how directly they line up with pro-Russian propaganda points**. The Kremlin regularly issues talking points, either via official statements or, more often, by reports in state-run or Kremlin-friendly media

<TEXT> Lulek's Rifle

At one of the station stops, my thoughts were interrupted by a group of American soldiers standing on the platform. Noticing the placard on one of the train doors: "Children of Buchenwald Coming Home," written in English and French, some of them got on the train and started talking to us. Lulek was sitting next to me, nibbling on an apple.

-

 One of the soldiers asked him in Yiddish what he would most like right now. Lulek did not hesitate. Pointing to the soldier's rifle, he said he wanted to kill German murderers. The soldier exchanged glances with his friends and got of the train. A few minutes later he returned, carrying a small rifle with the firing mechanism removed. "Kill as many as you can," he said, giving Lulek the gun.

"Greetings We too wanted to pledge our allegiance and commit ourselves while not present there. I am in USA now but we don't
have any arms. But is it possible to commit ourselves as dedicated martyrs anyway while here?
What I'm saying is, to shoot Obama and then get shot ourselves, will it do? That will strike fear in the hearts of infidels."

"In addition, JURABOEY stated that he would harm President Barack Obama if he had the opportunity to do so, but currently does not have the means or an imminent plan to do so."

While admitting that he does not like President Obama because of bis role in killing Muslims through his support of Israel and the recent bombing of ISIL, JURABOEY stated that he would not kill President Obama because of ill
will towards him, but rather because of "Allah." When asked to clarify the nature of his contact with ''H......news.com," JURABOEY stated that he wanted to communicate his approval of the actions of ISIL and establish contact with the group. He added that, if ISIL ordered him to kill President Obama, he would do so.
He further stated that any order to kill the President could come from anyone within ISIL-not necessarily only from ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi-provided that the order had a basis in the Koran and the "Sunna" (the traditions of the Prophet Muhammad). JURABOEV noted that if he received an affirmative or positive response from ISIL to the above-referenced posting on H......news, he would kill President Obama. JURABOEV added that he would also plant a bomb on Coney Island if he were so ordered by ISIL.

AFP pulled the story


[@AFP -#AFP on Monday withdrew a video showing flooding in Gaza which was filed in error without balancing Israeli comment](https://twitter.com/AFP/status/570538566540865538)

-


This is from the [study](http://vinc.s.free.fr/IMG/palsd_hydro-2.pdf)  Wadi Gaza Wetland Area by [The Mediterranean Wetlands Initiative](http://medwet.org/aboutmedwet/)  


-

"Yet it is evident that," Wadi Gaza used to flow in winter and bring huge
amounts of rainwater, disturbing the transportation between the northern and
southern parts of the Gaza Strip" (Goodson, 1999). Also due to interviews with
the local community of the wadi they confirmed that wadi Gaza used to flow
regularly during the winter season for at least two months and used to bring
huge amounts of water.
Since the early seventies this amount of water started to decrease considerably
due to the built up of [check dams](http://www.appropedia.org/Check_dam) and diversion schemes by Israel on the upper
course of the Wadi (Photo.., Annex 3). 
Since then the volume and duration of flow has decreased much with some
occasional flash floods sweeping down the Wadi bed at wet years. 

-

"Interviews with local
community of the area clears out that the wetland site till the late sixties
(1960's) was much bigger than it is now. Local people says that the wetland site
was permanently flooded and that it was like a jungle starting about 100 to 150
m from the railway line..."

-

Although accurate topographical maps are unavailable, the watershed of [Wadi Gaza [wikimapia.org]](http://wikimapia.org/#lang=en lat=31.412183 lon=34.449949 z=14 m=b show=/27826964/Gaza-Wadi) is estimated to cover more than 3500 km2 of the Northern Negeve Desert and the Hebron Mountains as well as the small catchment in Gaza. The Wadis length from origin to mouth is about 105 km, where the last 9 km of it is located in Gaza Strip. Its name Wadi Gaza is only for the last part which is located in Gaza. Wadi Gaza has two main tributes one is [Wadi Alshariah [wikimapia.org]](http://wikimapia.org/#lang=en lat=31.358914 lon=34.569340 z=13 m=b) which collects water from the Hebron Mountains in the West Bank and the other is [Wadi Alshallala [wikimapia.org]](http://wikimapia.org/#lang=en lat=31.321821 lon=34.490461 z=15 m=b show=/31088593/) which collects water from the Northern Negeve highest.

Conclusion: There are no dams and the diversions mitigate flooding. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Yet it is evident that," Wadi Gaza used to flow in winter and bring huge
amounts of rainwater, disturbing the transportation between the northern and
southern parts of the Gaza Strip" (Goodson, 1999). Also due to interviews with
the local community of the wadi they confirmed that wadi Gaza used to flow
regularly during the winter season for at least two months and used to bring
huge amounts of water.
Since the early seventies this amount of water started to decrease considerably
due to the built up of [check dams](http://www.appropedia.org/Check_dam) and diversion schemes by Israel on the upper
course of the Wadi (Photo.., Annex 3). 
Since then the volume and duration of flow has decreased much with some
occasional flash floods sweeping down the Wadi bed at wet years. 

-
"Interviews with local
community of the area clears out that the wetland site till the late sixties
(1960's) was much bigger than it is now. Local people says that the wetland site
was permanently flooded and that it was like a jungle starting about 100 to 150
m from the railway line..."

Although accurate topographical maps are unavailable, the watershed of [Wadi Gaza [wikimapia.org]](http://wikimapia.org/#lang=en lat=31.412183 lon=34.449949 z=14 m=b show=/27826964/Gaza-Wadi) is estimated to cover more than 3500 km2 of the Northern Negeve Desert and the Hebron Mountains as well as the small catchment in Gaza. The Wadis length from origin to mouth is about 105 km, where the last 9 km of it is located in Gaza Strip. Its name Wadi Gaza is only for the last part which is located in Gaza. Wadi Gaza has two main tributes one is [Wadi Alshariah [wikimapia.org]](http://wikimapia.org/#lang=en lat=31.358914 lon=34.569340 z=13 m=b) which collects water from the Hebron Mountains in the West Bank and the other is [Wadi Alshallala [wikimapia.org]](http://wikimapia.org/#lang=en lat=31.321821 lon=34.490461 z=15 m=b show=/31088593/) which collects water from the Northern Negeve highest.

Part of this video is also in The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum .

http://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/fv914

Their website says  that the video was purchased from University of South Carolina Newsfilm Library in Columbia, South Carolina in April 1992. 

Acquisition Notes:
The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum purchased this from University of South Carolina Newsfilm Library in Columbia, South Carolina in April 1992. The footage was obtained as research for the Museum's Permanent Exhibition.

Notes:

This clip is also on Film ID 235. Film IDs 235 and 236 have the same time codes. Film ID 235 contains more stories than Film ID 236, but the USHMM only has a VHS copy of Film ID 235.


The big question is if Film ID 235 is in this video (Film 237) or there's more footage. </TEXT>

As much as you'd like to think so, the truth is Israel is not in-control of rainfall

The real question is, what is happening in the rest of the area under Israeli water control? Have any Jewish-majority areas in Israel been evacuated because of floods? Any West Bank settlements? These aren't rhetorical questions, I really don't know and you seem to have access to reliable sources.

"Around 2pm, Southern Police's Negev Mountains rescue unit was called up to help two civilians whose car was stuck in a flood in HaBesor Stream on Route 222."

"Police closed Route 222 and other roads in the area and urged the public not to try to cross Vadis and running streams, even if it seems passable."
 
"Meanwhile, residents of Ein Gedi, Neot HaKikar and Ein Tamar have been stuck in their homes for two days now after flooding in streams in the area led to the closure of Highway 90."

<TEXT> I brought proof that before Israel diverted water into farming and reserves, the Wadi Gaza used to overflow during every winter, bring huge amounts of rainwater and disturb the transportation between the northern and southern parts of the Gaza Strip.  Israels diversion of the watercourse is mitigating the flooding.

It's logical to assume that harsh weather could bring on same conditions as was before the diversion.

"Meanwhile, residents of Ein Gedi, Neot HaKikar and Ein Tamar have been stuck in their homes for two days now after flooding in streams in the area led to the closure of Highway 90."

"Two civilians whose vehicle got stuck in the flooding from HaBesor Stream in southern Israel found themselves in need of assistance from an IAF helicopter and police divers on Saturday"

"We hope there isn't an emergency because we can't get out," Shahaf Homeri from Ein Gedi said. "The Arugot Stream is completely flooded. All of the streams south of here - Hever Stream and Tze'elim Stream - are flowing in a raging torrent and there's no way we could cross them. We're stuck from north and south, we can't go anywhere. It's just like we're on an island, you can't get to us." </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Wadi Gaza](http://wikimapia.org/#lang=en lat=31.321821 lon=34.490461 z=15 m=b show=/31088593/) is a wetland that has a potential to store the volume of more than 100,000 m3 of surface water.

 It is historically known to overflow during the winter, disturbing the transportation between the northern and southern parts of the Gaza Strip. Before Israel diverted some of the water into farming and reserves the Wadi Gaza used to overflow during every winter and bring huge amounts of rainwater. Now after the diversion the flooding is only after a big storm due to natural causes.


"Wadi Gaza wetland pond acts as important surface water storage reservoir, it
has the potential to store a volume of more than 100, 000 m3 of surface water." 

"Interviews with local
community of the area clears out that the wetland site till the late sixties
(1960's) was much bigger than it is now. Local people says that the wetland site
was permanently flooded and that it was like a jungle starting about 100 to 150
m from the railway line..."

"Yet it is evident that," Wadi Gaza used to flow in winter and bring huge
amounts of rainwater, disturbing the transportation between the northern and
southern parts of the Gaza Strip" (Goodson, 1999). Also due to interviews with
the local community of the wadi they confirmed that wadi Gaza used to flow
regularly during the winter season for at least two months and used to bring
huge amounts of water."

<TEXT> If a nation takes all the water of a watercourse and then releases mass amounts into a dry water way in times of heavy rains it must take proactive steps to prevent damage to other nations.

For the third time, where is the proof Israel released any extra water in to the watercourse? 

Before Israel diverted some of the water into farming and reserves the Wadi Gaza used to overflow during every winter and bring huge amounts of rainwater. Now the flooding is only after a big storm due to natural causes.

"Article 7 makes clear that the "no-harm rule"..

Not only is Israel not violating the "no-harm rule", the diversion is mitigating the flooding.  </TEXT>

First they blame Israel for diverting their natural resources and creating a shortage of water. Then, when it  rains an abundant amount of water in a short period of time and the Wadi naturally overflows, Israel is blamed for flooding. Logical?

<TEXT> Saw that a few days ago and looked in to it.
 

ITs 'source' [Al-Araby](http://www.alaraby.co.uk/society/a911a6c0-0d6a-4450-afe7-138feb8c1838) writes clearly that militias only seized a synagogue. 

The Shrine of Ezra still remains under Shi'a control.

I compared [Al-Araby's photo](http://www.alaraby.co.uk/fullimage/3f9b540d-4039-45e8-a648-9a4779a0938d/a911a6c0-0d6a-4450-afe7-138feb8c1838) to the Shrine of Ezra and found no resemblance. Don't trust me, do it yourself.

Here's video and photos of the Shrine.

The BRA had in mind a $30 million program to reverse the structural decline of the aging South Boston neighborhood, just across the channel on the south side of the city, under the heading of "General Neighborhood Renewal Plan". Estimating the some 47 percent of the district's housing stock was badly in need of repair or demolition, especially in the lower end, the plan called for 22 percent of the housing to be torn down, some new housing constructed, and the remaining dwelling units rehabilitated...
Signs exclaiming "To Hell with Urban Renewal" went up all over the neighborhood as residents engaged in picketing, sit-ins, and public demonstration, determined to hold on to their homes until they were "driven out by force".

<TEXT> EDIT: I should also mention that this would have been taken in 1945 most likely, or perhaps very late 1944, but definitely not 1943.

EDIT 2: I should also note that the US Army Air Force did not use Corsairs, so this is either a Navy or Marine aircraft, as they were the American users of the type.

You are wrong on *Edit:[the first] (both) assumption(s).

In February 1943 the [307th Operation Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/307th_Operations_Group) of the United States Air Force was assigned to the Thirteenth Air Force and stationed to Solomon Island in the Pacific.
Navy Corsairs were assigned as fighter escort for Air Force B-24 bombers belonging to the 307th Bomb Group.

<TEXT> The Hoover Dam was actually the first construction site to mandate hard hats on the job.

The Las Vegas Review Journal -  October 28, 1931
 
Nobody will be allowed in the canyon bottom without one of the helmets, henceforth, according to Ed Brockman, supervisor of insurance and safety for the Big Six. 

"And Six Companies is paying the bill.  A helmet for every man!  And more than fifty dozen already have been issued.  Others are en route from the factory, enough to protect the craniums of the army in its entirety.

I guess it was

If you only look at the weight difference, **Patricia O'Keefe** would hold the world record for greatest ratio.

<TEXT> What did you say before that

Exactly. Yet Abraham calls them Lord.

I was responding to your mindset that every time the Bible says Lord it means God.

On that I said it is untrue, adonai is used as Lord/Master of all or as Lord/Master.

But in this context it it is correct to say that in verse 3 it means God/Lord of all.

<TEXT> Neither have I. 

The whole thing doesn't make sense. As far as I know Shiites don't destroy Mosques.  

IT 'source' [Al-Araby](http://www.alaraby.co.uk/society/a911a6c0-0d6a-4450-afe7-138feb8c1838) writes clearly that the militias only seized the synagogue. The Shrine of Ezra still remains under Shi'a control.

I have no idea what went wrong..

I now compared [Al-Araby's photo](http://www.alaraby.co.uk/fullimage/3f9b540d-4039-45e8-a648-9a4779a0938d/a911a6c0-0d6a-4450-afe7-138feb8c1838) to multiple photo's of the Shrine of Ezra.

There's absolutely no resemblance. 

Side note; Josephus writes that Ezra Hasofer was buried in Jerusalem.

<TEXT> You got it all wrong.
One angels assignment was to tell Abraham that Sarah would him bear a child. Once his task is over, the Bible doesn't feel a need to continue speaking about him.


God appeared. 

18:1

Now the Lord appeared to him in the plains of Mamre

The three angels.

18:2

 And he lifted his eyes and saw, and behold, three men were standing beside him,

This doesn't mean actually standing "right" beside him for then there would be no need to run towards them

and he saw and he ran toward them from the entrance of the tent,". 

Abraham asked God not to leave him while he attended to the three angels.

18:3 
My lords (The word  (My lords) is plural, but the plural is interpreted as respectful, not meaning more then one), if only I have found favor in your eyes, please do not pass on from beside your servant.

One angels assignment was to tell Abraham that Sarah would him bear a child. 

18:10
And **"he"** said  

(note it's in singular form, it was one angel speaking)

I will surely return to you at this time next year, and behold, your wife Sarah will have a son.

The angels task was over, the Bible doesn't feel a need to continue speaking about him. 

The other two angels who continued on to Sodom still had a task to fulfill. 

18:22
And the men turned from there and went to Sodom

18:32 

And the Lord departed..

And he said, "My lords (The word  (My lords) is plural, but the plural is interpreted as respectful, not meaning more then one), if only I have found favor in your eyes, please do not pass on from beside your servant.

**** is in singular form because Abraham was addressing God, not the angels. 

Abraham asked God not to leave him while he attended to the three angels.

<TEXT> Never.  Jacob was striven with an angel, not God himself.



Besides for in reference to God, the word "Elohim" is used all over the Bible for false gods, angels and humans (Kings etc.).

Quick example, Exodus 7:1

The Lord said to Moses, "See! I have made you a **"Elohim"**( Lord) over Pharaoh, and Aaron, your brother, will be your speaker.

The Bible means that Moses was "divine' over Pharaoh because Moses was God's representative to Egypt.

This is how Genesis 32:29 should be read
 And he said, "Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, **because you have striven with an angel of God** ("Elohim") and with men, and you have prevailed."

Edit: Just remembered Psalms 8:6 with "Elohim" in reference to angels

Yet Thou hast made him but little lower than the **"Elohim"** (angels), and hast crowned him with glory and honor.

<TEXT> You are correct. Jabob wresling with the angel of Esau. 

Some Christians try to twist the meaning of scripture and claim it was Jesus.
They have this weird obsession with the Hebrew word "Ish" (Man).  Every time it is mentioned in the Bible they try to push Jesus in to it.

I'm in no way a Bible scholar and quite certain that I'm much younger then him.
But for anyone who reads the Bible in Hebrew all these claims sound completely ridiculous.

For any real questions, the proper person to ask is a Rabbi. </TEXT>

<TEXT> True, but my statement is still valid. "Adonai" is pleural  and "Adoni" is singular. 

According to you God, Jesus and the Holy Ghost all appeared in human form as "MAN" to Abraham. This is absurd. I doubt even Christians agree with you.

You also never answered my original question. If you interpret "Ish" to mean Jesus, how was Jacob able to overpower a God?

 
26 **When he saw that he could not prevail against him**, he touched the socket of his hip, and the socket of Jacob's hip became dislocated as he wrestled with him.

<TEXT> Exactly. Yet Abraham calls them Lord.

Sir, you are mistaken. The Hebrew word "Adonai" is used tens of times in Bible in a non divine way. 

The meaning is Lord as in Master *Edit 2/17 for Clarification:[ and also as Lord of all or God]. 

I'm mobile right now, but if you'd like, later tonight I can bring examples to prove you wrong. 

Your mistake may originate from the fact that you are reading a translation of the Bible instead of the Bible in its original form. 

*Edit 2/17 for clarification In this case it does mean Lord/Master of all or God but he's mistaken to assume that Adonai is always is in reference to God.

But as far as I l know according to the Judaism  the text is not referring to the three men only God

See http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/2vy0r5/serious_i_need_clear_explanation_for_this/conet74
for a proper explanation 

This mistake comes from translating Hebrew to English and defining one word as it's meaning without looking at each case for its context  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Christian concept of "trinity" came much later (I think John) and flies in the face of the Bible's account of God being one. 

Being three and somehow also one doesn't make sense. 

If "God" is composed of the unity of three, then each part of that "God" is lacking and not absolute. This is not "One" "God". 

Grouping the three dependent parts together and calling that trinity a one "God" doesn't diminish this.

Also no were does the Bible suggest that the Messiah will be in any way devine. 

G-d born to a virgin mother is an ancient pagan concept which was later adapted by the Christians. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never suggested that, I agree with you.

I have no idea why my religious affiliation was brought up in this sub.

My political opinion and has nothing to do with my religious views. If the victims would have been Christian, Muslim (one of them actually was), Hindu, Sikh, Atheist etc. I'd feel the same way.

My only issue is OBAMA calling it a RANDOM event and THE CONTEXT.

France declared it a targeted attack against Jews, Obama is calling it just a RANDOM act of violence.

He is ignoring the CONTEXT of the event, the Jewish victims and the supermarket, because the CONTEXT actually shows that it wasn't RANDOM. He is being politically biased to his views on policy. I wont get in to the details, it's a side topic...  


So what? Jews aren't special, they're no better than anyone else.

Jews are not special and are no different than anyone else.

Jews don't claim to be "special".

What do you think "chosen" means?

If you think "privileged" you're making a big mistake, because being "chosen" doesn't make things easy. Actually the opposite is true. Were the Jews killed in Auschwitz "special" or "privileged"?

You get chosen for something specific, not just generally "chosen".

According to Judaism, G-d chose Jews for more duties, not privileges and is harsher to them when it comes to judgment. Jews have to obey 613 Laws while non Jews only 7.

Lol, seriously? Look at the subs your a moderator of. look at your comment history. Your obviously a zionist 

bang head on wall

Thank G-d I have a high tolerance level and can keep my cool but it's nearing the breaking point.

Do you even have a clue what the subs stand for?

I am interested in genealogy (the study of ones ancestry).
Here's reddit's Genealogy sub  http://www.reddit.com/r/Genealogy/

I created a board for people who share common Jewish ancestors to connect and help each other with their family trees.
As of now it's inactive.

All the subs stand for 'Jewish Genealogy'. 

/r/jewgen
/r/Jewish_Genealogy
/r/jewishgen
/r/JewishGenealogy

They aren't  "Zionist" code word's...
Please explain what is racist or Islamaphobic about that. If anything you're the who is being racist and Judeophobic. 

Am I not allowed to be interested in my Jewish heritage and ancestry? 
 
Have a good one. I'm taking a brake from this non-sense. /bang head on wall

The source only uploaded an unedited video of Obama. Anyone can listen to it without bias and decide for themselves. 

Understand?

Edit 2/10
Is it important that it's disclosed what type of Muslim the victims are and what type of establishment they're in every time another situation happens?

Like I said before, my main issue is Obama calling it a RANDOM event. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for you concern.

My comments on this thread is my own political opinion and  has nothing to do with my belief. If the victims were Christian, Muslim (one of them actually was), Hindu, Sikh, atheist etc. i'd feel the same way.

My humble opinion is that Obama is ignoring the victims and portraying this hideous attack as something trivial. Be the victims of any race or religion.  He is ignoring the CONTEXT of the event, the Jewish victims and the supermarket, because CONTEXT actually shows that it wasn't a RANDOM act of violence

When I said that it appears that Obama is biased, I mean, that Obama has a political bias. Obama has a reason why he refrains from such discussions. I wont get it to it now, it's a side topic...

The only one who brought religion in to the discussion (if you can call it a discussion) was [andsothenbut](http://www.reddit.com/user/andsothenbut) and [secondaryaccount22](http://www.reddit.com/user/secondaryaccount22).

 [andsothenbut](http://www.reddit.com/user/andsothenbut) "knows" I am a Zionist (even though I'm not) and [secondaryaccount22](http://www.reddit.com/user/secondaryaccount22)" knows" what's better for Jews  (I have no idea why my religion was dragged in to this political discussion) and expects I listen to his orders (typical liberal view of claiming to know better then the person and then advise them to do as they think).

You are both bigoted and anti-semitic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the heads up. The OP deleted his post and you are now only quoting my comment WITHOUT CONTEXT. 

The OP posted that 
violence against civilians doesn't equate to terrorism

my response was;

"Yes. "Hitler wasn't a terrorist" because he "didn't kill" for the purpose of scare tactics, rather for ethnic cleansing and world domination. According to you "Hitler was the good guy"?
 
My only issue is OBAMA calling it a RANDOM event and THE CONTEXT.
He is ignoring the CONTEXT of the event, the Jewish victims and the supermarket, because the CONTEXT actually shows that it wasn't a RANDOM act of violence. He is being politically biased to his views on policy. I wont get in to the details, it's a side topic...

<TEXT> The source is irrelevant.  Please stick to your argument. 

Why is my title ridiculous? The accuser must bring fourth the evidence. 
 
I agree with you that there's nothing wrong in calling Jews a "bunch of folks" or a Kosher supermarket a "deli". 

The ONLY issue IS WITH THE CONTEXT, as you so rightfully say. 

France declared it a targeted attack against Jews, Obama is calling it just a RANDOM act of violence. Couple that with the fact he doesn't mention any of the CONTEXT of the event, the kosher supermarket and the victims being Jews(which shows that it wasn't a random act of violence). It appears to me he's being *Edit for clarification 2/10 [politically] biased. 

So yes, actually it's all about CONTEXT.

Interesting observation.  Your mouth is spewing vile hate, "extremist diartbags", "Zionist".. (which to your misfortune isn't true, I'm not a Zionist) and you have the audacity to call me an extremist? 

Even though you don't care about all that I wrote an till now, i'll still do you a favor and tell you that you're ruining the image of whatever political party you belong to.

I suggest you take some deep breaths or maybe even a walk and then if you speak as a decent human being should i'll listen to your opinion. 

*Edit 2/10 for clarification: The source only uploaded an unedited video of Obama to youtube. 
 Anyone can listen to it without any bias and decide for themselves. </TEXT>

France declared it was a targeted attack against Jews, Obama is calling it just a RANDOM act of violence which didn't target anyone specifically. Couple that with fact that President Obama did not mention any CONTEXT of said event and who was the target, makes me see him being politically biased. 

 OP, you're not going to garner support for your causes

You are wrong here again, Sir. I came on reddit to have a civil political discussion/debate. What makes you think I am trying to garner support. Am I a lobbyist?

<TEXT> and if he had published the commentary under his own name it would probably have been reasonably popular

Friedlander who forged the Yerushalmi was also a very knowledgeable person and could have just stuck to publishing his own commentary under his own name, if he would have put his mind to it. This is just something that I won't be able to understand.

And, at least in the edition I own, he includes a translation of Conan Doyle's story (presented as nonfiction) as an appendix to his own story, which is essentially a parallel narrative about the same events involving the Maharal acting behind the scenes. (Its been a long time since I actually read it so I don't remember all the details.)

Just looked it up. You are correct. </TEXT>

The maximum depth till the bottom surface under the water (more deep) would be the high number and minimum depth of surface till the bottom surface under the water (more shallow) would be the low number.

So let's look at question 1a: What is the maximum depth (more deep/high - number) you would reach if you traversed along the path shown below?
Follow the red line, at about 19.5 lat and 66.5 long the depth is -8,000 which is the deepest point on the line.

Edit: Another interesting detail, remembering the Holocaust is a lot more important to [r/Judaism](http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/) then Judaism being a part of your identity.

Also Maimonides scored the most in "Who is your favorite Rabbi/Theologian.

<TEXT> Most of the story's on the MaHaRaL's Golem comes from the book Nifl'os MaHaRaL miPrague by Rabbi Yudel Rosenberg. 

R' Rosenberg also put out a book called Choshen Mishpat. I once read it and noticed it is almost an exact copy of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's book The Jew's Breastplate.

He basically plagiarized the whole plot, story-line, just switched the main character to the *Edit: [MaHaRaL] and added his own ending. He then presented the fictional tale as fact.   

In the preface of both books Nifl'os Maharal miPrague and Choshen Mishpat Rosenberg claims it was based upon manuscript's he acquired.

Since I have proof he lied regarding the book Choshen Mishpat there's no reason for me to believe Nifl'os MaHaRaL miPrague  is anything more then fiction.
 
I believe the author has zero credibility and most if not all of his story's on the MaHaRaL's Golem is false.

<TEXT> The hate on social media is out of control. Search twitter for "Lakewood" and "Jew" for endless vile and anti-Semitic tweets.

Lately there has been significant raise in hate and anti-semitism from Jackson. 

The cause may have to do with recent events. A Hasidic sect built new house's bordering Jackson. For reason's I don't understand, some people don't like it.

Although this girl is clearly deranged, she is not the only family member that shares her views...
             
From social media post's it appears she may be using drugs, which explains a lot.   

Edit: I stand corrected. As far as I now know the new houses were not built near Jackson.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It appears you are grossly ill informed on the Shi'ite Houthis relations with the Jews.

The Houthi's have a vast history of anti-Semitic violence against Jew.

The Jew's of Yemen are anti-Zionist due to the secular nature of the State of Israel. This hasn't helped them one iota.

In January 2007, Houthi leaders threatened the Jewish families in Saada and Raida, "We warn you to leave the area immediately... We give you a period of 10 days, or you will regret it."

The entire community fled to the capital where the President of Yemen gave the Jews protection in the Jewish quarter in Alafi Qaa, Sanna.

In 2008 Moshe Nahari, a well-known figure in Raida's Jewish community was shot dead.

Not too long ago a Yemenite Jew was stabbed to death. I also remember another incident where a hand grenade was thrown at a Jew which killed him. I don't know if it was by Houthi's or AQAP.

Last month two Jewish boy's in Sanna were beaten by Houthi's and forced to convert to Islam by praying the Shahadah (There is no god but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God) to their prophet Mohammed.

The Jews of Yemen are constantly being being assaulted and harassed.

The Houthi's destroyed their homes, sanctuaries, cars, took their money and property.

They took over Yemen's Jewish library which also holds many antique Jewish manuscripts and a very ancient and rare Torah scroll.

In the 1930's there were over 40 synagogues in Sanna alone, today there's only one left. Many Jewish cemetery's were also destroyed.

This the end of the 2,500 year's of Jews in Yemen.


So no, "Death to Israel" is not a reaction to government policy, it's plain old Jew hatred. </TEXT>

So no, the Houthi's aren't any different then other extremists with regard to their hatred to Jews. In a sense they are worse. Anti-Semites justify their hatred by saying they are only anti-Israel. The Jews of Yemen are clearly anti-Israel and still being targeted.

<TEXT> If it's disturbing your normal routine of life you should see a psychologist/therapist. Cognitive therapy may also help. 


Do you experience the same level of anxiety in all large gatherings and events or is your anxiety predominant in a religious setting?

If your anxiety is predominant in a religious setting, it may very well be that your anxiety stems from a fear of being judged/guilt on religious observance or someone finding out a dark secret/sin which you are embarrassed about.

In the Brooklyn Museum (p.276, fig. 310) resides a papyrus scroll numbered Brooklyn 35:1446 which was acquired in the late 19th century by Charles Wilbour. This dates to the reign of Sobekhotep III, the predecessor of Neferhotep I and so the pharaoh who reigned one generation before Moses. This papyrus is a decree by the pharaoh for a transfer of slaves. Of the 95 names of slaves mentioned in the letter, 50% are Semitic in origin. What is more, it lists the names of these slaves in the original Semitic language and then adds the Egyptian name each had been assigned, which is something the Bible records the Egyptians as doing, cf. Josephs name given to him by pharaoh (Genesis 41:45). Some of the Semitic names are biblical and include:- Menahem, Issachar, Asher, and Shiprah (cf. Exodus 1:15-21) - John Fulton </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wrote this brief chronicle of events pertaining to the killing of Jordanian pilot, First Lieutenant Muath al-Kasaesbeh.

Aug 17, 2014 - ISIS posts a video of Haruna Yukawa, a captured Japanese national.

Sep 2014  The King of Jordan   Japan join the US-led coalition against ISIS.

Dec, 24 2014 - ISIS posted a video which purportedly shows a successful hit from a shoulder fired missile on a Jordanian F16 Fighter Jet.
Videos and photos of captured Jordanian Pilot, First Lieutenant Muath al-Kasaesbeh was also uploaded.

Dec 24, 2014 - US Central Command said in a statement that evidence clearly indicates that ISIS did not down the aircraft.

Dec 25, 2014 - The Pilot's father went on Jordanian State Television and pleaded for ISIS to have mercy on his son (later, not sure when, I think Kasasbeh's brother was also on State TV).

Jan 6, 2015 -ISIS released a video titled Message from Muslims to the Family of the Pilot.

Jan 8, 2015 - Activist and blogger Abu Ibrahim Al-Raqqawi tweeted A group of #ISIS members in #Raqqa are talking among them enthusiastically about the execution of Jordanian pilot, Maath al-Kassassbeh, who was burned to death by #ISIS,

Jan 17, 2015 - ISIS released a video titled "Interviews About the Jordanian Pilot".

Jan 19, 2015 - In a video titled A Message to the Government and People of Japan ISIS threatened to kill two Japanese hostages if a ransom of $200 million was not received within a 48 hour deadline (no pun intended).

Jan 24, 2015 - After the 48-hour deadline passed, ISIS released a video titled Slaughtering a Japanese Captive and Appeal of Second To His Family and Government in which Japanese hostage Kenji Goto Jogo stated that his fellow captive Haruna Yukawa was executed.

ISIS then switched their demands and stated the Jordanian will be killed unless Sajida al-Rishawi, an AQI (al-Qaida in Iraq) terrorist held by the Jordanian Gov. is released within the next 72 hours.

January 27, 2015 - In an ISIS released video titled Final Deadline for the Jordanian Government To Release Sjidah al-Rshaw Before Sunset Thursday, Japanese hostage Kenji Goto stated that the Jordanian air force pilot held by ISIS will be killed unless Sajida al-Rishawi, an AQI terrorist held by the Jordanian authorities is released by Sunset.

ISIS intention was to swap Kenji Goto for Sajida al-Rishawi.

January 27-28, 2015 - The Jordanian Government agreed to free Sajida al-Rishawi, but only in exchange for their air force pilot Lieutenant Muadh al-Kasasbeh and only after proof of life was given.

Japan wanted to stick to ISIS demands and have their journalist Kenji Goto freed.

ISIS did not publicly respond to the Jordanian Government.

January 29, 2015 - The deadline set forth by ISIS passed, with Jordanian Officials demanded proof of life of before agreeing to any exchange.

January 31, 2015 - ISIS released a video titled A Message to the Government of Japan with footage of Kenji Goto's dead body.

Feb. 2015 - Jordan threatened to expedite the execution of ISIS and AQI terrorist members who were currently in their custody if Kasasbeh would be killed by ISIS.

Feb. 3, 2015 - ISIS posted a 22-minute long video titled "Healing of the Belivers Chest" which includes footage of the Jordanian air force pilot Kasasbeh doused in flammable material, locked in a cage being burned alive.

Feb. 3, 2015 - Jordanian State TV reported that Jordanian pilot Kasasbeh was killed a month before on January 3, 2015.
It is unclear how they concluded his exact day of death and why it wasn't known or publicized before.

Feb. 3, 2015  The Jordanian Government said that prisoner Sajida al-Rishawi, the woman ISIS wanted in the prisoner exchange and Ziad al-Karbouli, both AQI terrorists, were executed in response to the video. </TEXT>
