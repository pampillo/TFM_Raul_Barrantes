<TEXT> If you don't want to read Pippi Longstockings I can recommend Ronja Rvardotter or Brderna Lejonhjrta. They're not aimed at as young an audience as most of her other books. And are more in line with traditional fantasy genre.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> First post here. 

I enjoyed The Lost Symbol on a vacation 2009. Almost as much as The Da Vinci Code. But after having read almost 300 pages of Inferno, I just don't feel it. 

The mysteries and puzzles are nowhere to be seen, and it feels like the plot has been one big chase for a third of the book. (Run! Oh nice hiding place! Oh fuck, the police! Run! Oh nice hiding place! Etc.) 
The secondary character is pretty interesting but hasn't had that much of screen time. 


I just want to know. Is the book worth getting through? Does it get as good as the previous two books in the series, or close to it? Because as of now I just want to quit it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Soon (very soon) I'm going on a road trip through Europe. Our route is basically

Lbeck -
Stuttgart -
Milan -
Marseille -
Barcelona - 
Alicante

If we get tired of CD's and Spotify playlists it would be nice to have some old fashion FM radio to listen to. If you know any good Radio Stations avalible along this route. Please share.

Both music and talking (english speaking though) stations are appreciated. We are fans of rock, pop and metal of different kinds. 

If you got a favourite station that is not in English but plays good music you are free to share that too. 

Thanks </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sorry. That was a good comment you linked to. I didn't go that far back as to more than a *month back in time* But I still didn't see a post from you in this sub, and the few ones I saw on the subject of Bernie were strangely familiarly formulated not discussing any policy of his. Just broad key words like socialism, anti globalism, stagnated economy. Etc, etc. 

I didn't accuse you in that sense. It's just there has been A LOT of fresh accounts coming here trying to cool things down. And when you didn't answer my question if you think Bernie has got enough name recognition but instead talked about how neutral you are  I began suspecting something was wrong. And I waited a good while before I said something about it. 

I just thought that everyone agreed what Bernie's main concern is, is a certain other runner's name recognition that Bernie really lack. And found it weird you didn't think so. 

Not everyone needs to be a vocal supporter. I don't think that. 

I'm sorry if I offended you. I hope we can put our "pitchforks"  down and be civil. You seem like a good guy that stand up for what you believe. And hopefully we can end this discussion here on good terms because I really don't have time to do this anymore.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> First. I know there are Israeli communities that work. That's not relevant when talking about Bernie Sanders. So why you would bring it up to a hater is beyond me. And why you would hang out in a subreddit which very name is "Bernie for President" and not think he will win the general if he wins the primary. I'm not a campaign representative either. Heck. I won't even before for him. Because I can't. But Me and dare I say it everyone else are in this sub to promote good ideas on how to make Bernie the next president. And I don't feel you have done that at even a single time. 

And second. Your first response basically said that you think the name recognition Bernie Sanders is getting from msnc is plenty. And you think this viral campaign is "badly timed" 

I'm calling it. Call me a loony if you want. I think we got a Shill. A sneaky one at that. 

And that's all I got for this time folks. I don't have time for this anymore. But that's my opinion.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's great. I would love to be able to donate. But am neither allowed to nor have the spare money to do so sadly. 

And of course you should be open minded and I praise you for it. 
But I looked and you haven't written anything positive at all. Not that is perfectly clearly positive. 

And you even wrote in a thread about bernie in response to someone who don't think socialism works.... in /r/politics and I quote: "Actually. Socialism does work out well.....When applied on a small scale like the tiny communal villages in Israel." 


I know that YOU know that he isn't a absolute Socialist. And you explained that in a later post. But people won't always read every answer all the time. And I don't think that the first comment you made really benefit Bernie. Actually it is kind of a shitty comment to make if you advocate for Bernie because the American people don't know the difference between branches of socialism. 

And I think everyone here that wants more followers of bernie need to think about what they say in relation to him because not everyone know what he talks about. They might only know he's a Socialist and that is what we need to change. Correct me on that last statement of I'm wrong. And any other statement or assumption I made.

But I think my opinion is well founded, and I would love someone's opinion on that.

American students abroad, and foreign students in America will make this a global issue. I think Sweden can use a bit of the billionair talk. We abolished the inheritance tax some years ago..... And the new budget yesterday didn't mention the really wealthy... 

And I'm sure it's not just Sweden. UK got a real (real)  problem too.  Some insanely rich Swedes are actually moving to UK because of this.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> edit: So.  You think he get's enough name recognition? 

Just to end my curiosity. How come, every comment you previously made about bernie make about him or any of his policies come across as completely neutral but seems to point towards pre ww2 politics, anti globalism and other short general expressions?? There is no positive feedback. Only subtle resent as I take it. 

I'm just curious and you are free to explain this and we're done here. 

Because we have different opinions and mine is. 

The time to act, is now. Not later.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> EDIT: IMPORTANT  **Tl ; Dr** conchobarrmacness has no previous post  in /r/bernieforpresident.  and  we have a long and extremely boring discussion below. My opinion: I think he subtly speaks against bernie. That may be because that's just his way of expression. Or it might not be. Quotes below. 
two comments down he basically says this video campaign needs to go viral later,  not now because Bernie already got a lot of name recognition.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  (he never respond to why he said that, even though I ask him several times) 

On an ending note, after the "wow"  response. I'm positive. This needs to go viral asap.

End edit. 


A viral video can include something that puts another candidate in a different light than they are currently in. And it is achievable by just speaking the truth in good manners. Without saying anything negative about anyone. </TEXT>

One of my lucid dream once though, and I think it was my first one. And didn't understand what it was. Was [Re-he-he-he-heaaly](https://youtu.be/D2MPoqqzwdY) weird

But it basically was that everything I didn't want to happen. Happend.

I got aware of this fact in this dream, and turned it around. "Faking I didn't want something to happen that I really did want. And it worked. I got some time with that and just "fake feared" a lot of good stuff and that was it.

One night when I was gonna watch go turn on the TV (probably a recorded pokmon episode or something) I remember being more afraid of the dark than usual. 
As I walk up to it to start it, I get this irrational fear of a growling bear or dinosaur. Or something. When I turn on the TV. There is a growling bear/dinosaur/whatever animal I was imagining right there growling. 

I ran down as fast as I could. And I still remember it to this day.

**tl;dr: One time I predicted what was gonna be shown on the TV before I turned it on**

Not saving any location data more than temporary on the local device.

<TEXT> Jag hller med dig om att frverkliga skatter som inte drabbar gemene man utan endast de otroligt frmgna. (Jag vet inte vart grnsen gr mellan frmgen och otroligt frmgen) 

Men lt oss sga 200 miljoner kronor.

Och som du sger r det ltt att undvika skatterna fr de som har resurserna. Kamprad har vl inte betalat ngon skatt sedan 1982 skulle jag tro.

Men att det mste gras r klart tycker jag. Det finns ingen sim behver miljarder kronor i personliga tillgngar. Men att det finns mnga som har det r sjlvklart. Och att de vill behlla allt r egentligen inte deras fel. Det r inprntat i vra gener efter miljoner rs selektivt urval fr att man ska vilja bra med sig s mycket mat hem man bara kan. Vra gener r vr vrsta fiende.

Kanske r det EU som borde ta tag i detta. Men den chansen r inte direkt stor.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> *"Konfiskeras"*. Du behver inte ta i s du spricker min mn.

Istllet fr att hja arbetsgivaravgifter och elskatt kan man kanske istllet hja frmgenhetsskatten med 3% p alla som har mer n 2 Miljarder kronor i personliga tillgngar?

Eller tror du att man skulle sakna ngra miljoner om man hade s mycket pengar? 

**Vad gller bankerna.** S verkar du ha ftt allt om bakfoten. Bankerna kraschade fr att Clinton (Den amerikanska staten som du sger) lt sl ihop de kommersiella bankerna som ger ut ln, med investmentbanker som handlar med kapital p bl.a aktiemarknaden. (**Och detta gjorde han fr att han ftt massor med donationer frn bankerna fr att gra just detta**). Inte fan r politiker s dumma att de gr det med vilja. De hade massor med ptryckningar frn marknaden att gra just detta. Och stoppar man tillrckligt med pengar i kampanjfinansiering t politiker i USA s kan man f dem att lgga en rst i ett lagfrslag som gynnar dig. S r det bara.

Bank A brjar lna pengar av Bank B fr att investera i marknaden, sedan lnar Bank B pengar av Bank C fr att investera i marknaden. 

SEN. brjar det roliga. Bank A lnar pengar av Bank C fr att kunna betala tillbaka lnet till bank C och Bank B som d fr in lite pengar investerar vidare. Detta fortstter och 2008 hnde det som mnga ekonomer skrek sina halsar rda ver i nstan 10 r utan att ngon lyssnade. 

HELA SYSTEMET FLL. Och de tog halva Europa med sig.

Du kan inte sga att det r var personers ln utan kreditvrdighet som orsakade kraschen. Det var bankernas vrdslshet och girghet som orsakade den och inget annat. </TEXT>

(Han motstter sig ocks stora handelsavtal mellan USA och Asien som bara finns fr att det ska bli billigare att importera varor tillverkade av 10ringar..)

Hillary Clinton har ndrat nstan allt hon har att sga fr att matcha honom. Han har ftt ett enormt genomslag p bara en och en halv mnad sedan han utannonserade att han skulle delta i valet.

In Sweden there is a Vacation Law. That basically says you are *entitled* to 4 weeks of consecutive payed vacation sometime between June and August.
Some people save a week or two. Others take it all. Others save them all for up to five years and just stops working for a year. (not very usual, but the vacation days can be saved up to five years)

There are exceptions when a company can order you back or else. But that has to be very special circumstances and I've never heard of it.

<TEXT> Open you mind. 

EDIT: I'm not in an environmental group. I read scientific papers based on tons of evidence about all kinds of subjects. The environment happens to be one of them. You can look it up yourself if you want. Evidence supported by far more than a handful of scientists. Your own [NASA](http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/) included. Which earth sciences Ted Cruz want's to cut funding for because they collide with his and his donor's personal interests. The reasons he give for wanting to ct their earth sciences research is because he don't think they should do research. But only space travel....  They are not interested in facts, and will try to shut down everyone who tries to give them facts.. You. The voter of America. Have to look at the evidence with open eyes and think. 

END EDIT :
Because what the oil industry is doing is taking the carbon that has been stored in the earth for billions of years. Dead animals and plants getting crushed and broken down into raw oil over the eons.

In an exponentially increasing rate we have been pumping it up. And set it on fire in engines and power plants. 

The chemical process while burning any kind of oil basically joins a carbon atom with 2 oxygen atoms, making it into a gas and released into the atmosphere. The increasing density of the molecule that is formed: CO2, due to the dark color of the carbon atom. Makes sunlight reflected on the earths surface (mostly ocean and ice caps reflect sunlight. But with increasing levels of carbon in the air more and more sunlight is being absorbed by the darker atoms, just like a black t-shirt gets warmer than a white t-shirt.

This is a spiral. The more carbon, the warmer it gets. And when millions and millions of years old ice melts and exposes methane gas trapped underneath. Temperatures will climb even more because methane absorbs even more sunlight. 


I'm sorry that you are a little out of the loop, genuinely. I understand what kind of upbringing you had. but you should always know that it is never to late to late. Never. ever to late to change.

Oh. And $2500 so out of touch with reality I'm almost crying.. [Read for yourself](http://www.thenation.com/blog/178743/koch-brothers-spent-twice-much-2012-election-top-ten-unions-combined) 412 670 666$, I have read higher and I have read lower. But nothing that comes close to your number.  </TEXT>

The Koch brothers. Worth 40 billion dollars. EACH. Those guys deserve their money. I mean. Their father made them selling oil riggs to the russians after all. They should get to do whatever they want with it. Tax Free. Even though their company is one of the major contributors to the climate changing... And they neglecting the existance of the very phenomenon that would actually hurt their business?

The impending drought climate that is predicted to hit America in about 10-15 years, much due to the fact of global warming?

Let me guess. You don't believe in global warming. You are choosing to believe the 3 % of the world's scientists on this issue, instead of the 97% that says it's as real as you and me. And it's gonna have consequences.

And I just think that a building a fusion reactor here on earth is not only reaaaaaallly hard but also unnecessary because we already have one that's gonna hang around for about a couple of billion years. But hey. I know you want to educate people on science. I suggest you don't do it in the /r/science because here people actually know some things...

However we want to make "green energy" that is not nuclear. The energy is always gonna come from the sun. I am beginning to think Fusion Reactors is a red herring to keep us from beginning to invest in solar of various kind.

Also you can save your overtime as vacation. Or take it out in money. Your choice.

But 2 weeks is a lot better than no weeks. So keep at it guys. You will win it. And [I shall cheer for you](http://www.sharegif.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Gladiator-quotes-3.gif) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure you can believe that if you want. But the questions you need to ask yourself. Do you agree with his policies? 

I will tell you some of his policies:

**Flat Taxes**: That means people who owns a billion dollars will pay as much tax as one who owns ten thousand dollars. And ten dollars. Flat tax rate means everyone pays the same tax. Regardless of anything.

He wants to abolish **Net Neutrality**. That means he doesn't want internet providers to load all websites at the same rate. 
Basically advertising will load instantly, and the youtube video will load slow. Because the advertiser has payed a lot to increase their speed. Net Neutrality is good.. No.. IT'S GREAT and nothing we want to live without.

TED CRUZ **don't want abortions. **

Oh, and he hates **immigrants**, **homosexuals** and he want's to send US troops into the middle east again to fight ISIS. Instead of letting the neighbouring countries that are the good kind of Islam take care of things.

That was the last I had to say on this matter man. I hope you have opened your eyes, or are the biggest troll. Because otherwise..

<TEXT> Ja, jag funderade med p om elpriset skulle pverka industrier. Och det gr de sklart. Du har rtt. nnu en anledning till att inte hja energiskatt p krnkraft istllet fr kol och olja.
Jag har debatterat s mycket att jag inte orkar att skriva fackligt. Jag r inte srskilt bra p det heller. Jag vill mest f folk att tnka till.

Inkomstskatt r en dlig skatt enligt mig. Antingen beskattar man frmgenhet eller konsumtion av varor som inte uppfyller de krav man stllt p dem rrande kvalit, milj eller arbetsfrhllanden.
Som du sger r det vldigt svrt att beskatta frmgenhet fr de smiter. Skattesmitare borde sprras in lika hrt som ngon som som kr ver ngon med bil och ker drifrn.

Stannar man och gr sin plikt r det lugnt. Tnker man bara p sig sjlv och ker drifrn ska man bli straffad.

Skatt p kapitalvinst r ju det bsta. P det sttet skrar man att pengarna stannar kvar i landet och inte sticker ivg via nn stiftelse till Bahamas. </TEXT>

Det r ett **marginellt** problem, som anvnds som en ljuspekare fr en huskatt nr matte ska ta rkor och dricka vin.

**Snlla.** (Jag sger ordet och menar det) Kan vi inte ta invandringsfrgan i en annan trd?

Med det sagt ska jag agera hycklare. Och frklara varfr invandringen **egentligen** inte r ngot problem.

Vi skulle ha rd. Vi skulle ha rd med att lra upp ALLA invandrare. De skulle kunna f lra sig svenska och f fullgod sjukvrd. 
Vi skulle kunna hja lnerna fr lrarna. Vi vet att vra grundskole och gymnasieutbildningar r p vg ner i rnnstenen. Statistik ljuger inte. Vad sgs om att hja lnerna fr lrare, s att kvalificerade mnniskor knner att de inte kastar sina framtida pengar i sjn fr att utbilda sig till ett av de dlaste yrken som finns och istllet vljer att bli ekonom. (jag lser programmering, hade velat bli lrare)

Vi skulle ha rd med allt detta och lite till om vra nationalhjltar vi alltid hyllar, som startat IKEA, Hennes   Mauritz, Tetra Pak m.m m.m skulle komma ver sitt begr att behlla varenda krona (som de sklart har kmpat jvligt hrt fr. Iallafall de flesta av dem) och komma underfund med att en mnniska och hans eller hennes familj inte behver ha flera miljarder kronor att rra sig med. Man blir inte lyckligare av att ha s mycket pengar. Det r vetenskapligt bevisat (ett uttryck som vattnats ur och frlorat sin slagkraft. Men tnk p vad det betyder).

Vissa av dessa fretag har flera gare, med tskilliga miljarder (20-30) i frmgenhet vardera.
Mnga av dem str skrivna i London, p Bahamas och andra platser dr de p ett eller annat vis antingen slipper undan skatt eller behver betala vldigt mycket mindre n hr i Sverige.

Allt fr att ha 12 Miljarder kronor p kontot istllet fr 7 miljarder kronor.

(Kamprad har ver 500 miljarder kronor. Snart 2% av de dr 40 000 miljarderna alla skojar om. Hela jvla tiden)

<TEXT> De enda som svarar p en sn hr trd r sdana mnniskor som verkligen inte hller med. 

Den nya budgeten - jag vet inte om jag ska skratta eller grta. r detta vrt vlfrdssamhlle vi s ofta skryter om? 
De Rdgrna - Socialdemokraterna, Miljpartiet, och vnsterpartiet har presenterat en budget som gr mig rdd. Klarar du att lsa min text med ett ppet sinne beundrar jag dig fr jag brjar bli osker p min politiska stllning sjlv. Men om du eftert inte delar min sikt. Svara att du tycker jag har fel..

I budgeten finns mycket gott. Vi ska f bttre infrastruktur. Jrnvgen behver verkligen renoveras, och det verkar vara p gng. Dessutom tycks snabbtg mellan Oslo och Stockholm bli av. Vi fr fler utbildningsplatser, satsningar p vrden. Slopning av lxhjlpstillskottet som inte verkar ha hjlpt ett dugg och istllet satsning. kat underhllsstd. Allt som ska ske verkar jttebra.

Vart kommer finansieringen ifrn? Har man beskattat de miljardrer vi ftt fler av n ngonsin i Sverige de senaste ren? 
De som tillsammans ger 1 120 Miljarder kronor.

Nej. De behver inte betala hgre skatt. Den strsta delen av finansieringen kommer frn arbetsgivaravgiften fr unga. Som nu r tillbaka p samma niv som innan den snktes. De som kommer drabbas hrdast r allts de som har en liten omsttning och vill anstlla. Jobb kommer frsvinna
Krnkraften ska beskattas. Det r ocks en punkt. Jag r neutral till krnkraft, men man kan beskatta krnkraft fre kol och olja nr ens koalition har frgen grn i namnet gr mig frbi. Detta kommer drabba alla svenskar. Elpriserna kommer hjas. Och vilka kommer att f lida mest? Vanliga mnniskor sklart.

Jag r inte en politisk mnniska. Men jag r inte helt krd i huvudet. Ska budgeten godtas av alla som rstade rdgrnt? Ska det s kallade arbetarpartiet hja skatten p *arbetare* istllet fr att hja skatten p dem som bokstavligt talat skulle kunna bygga sin egen pengabinge?

I USA har en fr oss i Sverige helt oknd Senator och presidentkandidat ftt ett sdant genomslag nr han talar om frmgenhetsklyftorna att han p allvar hotar Hillary Clinton i opinionsunderskningarna. 
Och vi i Sverige mrker inte att vrt ekonomiska klimat lutar mer t USA n vrt eget Sverige nu fr tiden.

Och kom inte med att det blir Alliansen nsta val. De kommer inte gra ngonting bttre de heller. 

Jag vill hra folk sikter. Slpp vilket parti ni rstar p och frga er sjlva hur man kan hja avgifter och skatter p sdant som drabbar gemene man *istllet* fr att beskatta, **inte de rika.** Utan de snuskigt rika. 

Vad r skillnaden p 60 miljarder kronor och 50 miljarder kronor i en frmgenhet? 

Samtidigt r invandringen allt vi pratar om i politiken. r inte detta ett villospr vet jag inte vad som r det.

<TEXT> Well. You just got another follower, so I hope it's gonna even out.. I won't comment anymore because I think Bernie's stance on negative attacks are spot on and not needed. Also, I imagine the circlejerk (which I participate in) here is even worse than in /r/SandersForPresident. But I will gladly upvote a post if the link is a serious source with a good point, because the fact that america might have another Clinton vs Bush is fucking terrifying. :) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Sweden's new budget proposed by the "house" lead by "Socialdemokraterna" (Bernie adopts a lot of the same issuses) finally gets signed. Link to income inequality review. I believe there are some ammunition for you guys here. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-17 05:45:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys! I'm from what we jokingly call "The Welfare State". And I got news from Sweden that might help in getting a grip of what extended social benefits might mean for the economy and how to formulate the benefits of a stronger social welfare program. I believe there's some ammunition here to counter disclaims on Bernie.

**What the budget raises support for:**

support for single parents

More employees in elderly care

6 500 new spots for higher education

Infrastructure

Local climate investment Support

Scientific Research 

Commercial Stimulation




What I link to below is a PDF file (text) from the government  that reviews income inequality in Sweden, the proposed budget's points that adress it and what the expected results from the changes in the budget are (page 24).

http://www.government.se/globalassets/regeringen/dokument/finansdepartementet/tema-statens-budget/varbudget-2015/vap-bilaga-2-fordelningspolitisk-redogorelse.pdf


Use google translate's function where you can translate a PDF to read it in english. It looks awful, but the translation is good. Not perfect but good.

The raises in welfare programs are for now mostly payed for by slightly higher tax on nuclear energy (which provides almost 50% of the energy) But higher tax on fossil fuels and on capital gains are proposed and will enter into force in 2016.


**Swedish guys** If this is interesting for the sub. We could translate this document in 30 minutes each. Probably less.



Also the fact that the budget passed makes me proud to be a Swede. The opposing block forfeited regarding the budget to let the sitting "house" pass the vote.

<TEXT> I'm not an American but a Swede so I'm not really that into your politics. O'Malley sounded good on an info site, but when I look at his voting history he has vetoed a LOT of good legislations that I skimmed. Considering my recent history in this thread that might not mean much. But for example [this one](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:S.296:) That forces drug manufacturer to inform the Secretary (whover that is. But I guess Secretary of Health or something?) when there is about to be a shortage of one of their drugs for MORE manufactoring reasons than discontinuing the said drug.


Did I misread this too, or is that a realllllllllly good legislation O'Malley vetoed? It would give sick people more time to find a substitute drug? But I guess it would hurt companies profits.....

Living in Sweden, enjoying "free" healthcare and education payed for by the country together I think you guys could use some Bernie Sanders. But I heard 'Murica is a free country. Of course you should vote for a politician representing your beliefs. Whoever that may be.

Oh boy. you didn't read the article, but just read the top comments?
The article clearly states that [Clinton's Financial Disclosure] (http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/16/us/politics/document-hillary-clintons-financial-disclosure-form.html?_r=0) (You can read the stuff yourself and see.) shows she and her family made 11 million dollars from speeches that are not accounted for in the "Clinton Foundation".

I expected someone who watched Game of Thrones to be a little clever at least. Considering Tyrion is your favourite character (lucky guess?) :)

On topic: What your're speaking is truetrue. I think this is the stuff Bernie will advocate a lot when he gets more attention. He apparently changed Vermont a lot for the better. (According to himself of course, but I don't think he would win by such a long stretch and for such a long time if he didn't deliver.)

I feel like I'm part of this by spreading the word here. And in related posts on reddit. Even though it's bloody hard. People are so stuck in their mindsets it's scary.

I'm thinking of getting engaged in the board of my condo. Don't know what it's called in english. But if they don't get enough people engaged it will turn into a rental. And that would just add to the inequality. So at least that's something..... </TEXT>

"It's literary fame"

longest EDIT in history: We really need to make this a thing. Joe is genuinely surprised. she is trying to make it look like he's just up because New Hampshire is close to Vermont. Sure, it's partially true, But I'm fairly sure New Hampshire is pretty on to the politicians being a what'sitcalled.


It's gonna be the best steal of a quote when Bernie wins this whole thing. (Trust me, I'm slamming the wood with both my fists for those who believe that sort'a thing)

Because most news channels gets a fat paycheck from the ones making the big buck. (yes, duh, and how this was allowed to be spoken on the largest station in the world is basically a miracle) 

I'm telling it straight to the ones who are stubborn (usually a good trait, so don't dispair)

**It's never too late to come to your senses.**

<TEXT> No need to be passive aggressive. Maybe my point wasn't clear. I mean there should be a healthy amount of competition between production companies so as to encourage innovation and low prices.

The problem with absolute socialism is that it doesn't work. There needs to be some kind of a free market, but it should be more regulated than it is today in America so as to ensure that the workers aren't abused.

If someone can help me I will be your muppet for a day.
My "white whale" is a muppet show of some sorts that got recorded over my vhs tape of the episode of pokemon where ash meets Snorlax. (The tape is broken because of rewinds)

There was a scene with a muppet that was showering, and he peed in the shower and it was hilarious as a ten year old. I remember me and my cousin competing over who could hold their laughs the longest.

<TEXT> I loved this growing up. Doktor Mugg is a Swedish television series, named after the program's title character. The series takes place in the fictitious town Dasseborg (Outhouseburg) and revolves around toilet humor, mugg and dass being colloquial terms for toilet in the Swedish language. Other important main characters are Kapten Filling (Captain Skivvies) and Walter Closett.

Doktor Mugg tries to force the citizens to buy his invention "Pruttomobilen" ("The Fartmobile"), a mobile toilet.

**tl;dr**

The show is about a villain trying to make people buy his own product "The Fartmobile". </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi! I wonder if anyone out there has any experiences in old radios and how to get them working again?

It's an old swedish model, I found information about it on this site: http://www.radiomuseum.org/r/luxor_r192b.html

I found it at my grandfather's summer house and wonder if there are any way of getting it to work?

As of now I believe the only thing missing are the two batteries.

So, I wanted to make a version of Serenity in KSP with as few mods as possible. And after two hours of building and refining this is the first version that I was able to land with, without experiencing a rapid unscheduled disassembly.

I wanted to share it and I hope it inspire someone to make a better version. I'm a rookie when it comes to replicas and building stuff for fun in KSP and I know there are really talented engineers out there.

<TEXT> Alright. Interesting. Do you think he would name Warren, or is there someone else I do not know about?

In any case I think Warren will run for POTUS in 2020. And if Bernie doesn't reach all the way she can pick up the momentum his campaign is sure to get. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Kul med en annan svensk som tagit upp intresse fr amerikansk politik i och med Sanders.

I'd say he lines up good with the swedish Center and the Environmental Party. The American right wing is so far right we can't even see it on the political spectrum in Sweden. 
Although Sanders is fighting to introduce legislations and systems that has been in place in Sweden for many, many years (public healthcare payed for by everyone through taxes, and free education tuitions)

Bran climbed the walls of Winterfell so many times that he knew every rock. 

He has gotten better and better at warging Hodor. It will culminate with Bran somehow warging/influencing Ser Duncan the Tall. Thick as a **castle wall**

My theory is rooted in Bran's nagging about wanting to be a knight, people telling him he can't ever be. But Dunk was never knighted!

And a line from The Sworn Sword. when Dunk defies his sworn lord and sends the poor villagers home, practically saving their lives. "It was if some god had put the words in my mouth. Not the warrior". </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah that looks exactly like it. I was about 8 meters away, but there was a dude swimming closer with a camera so I guess it was something worth photographing. If so that's one of the most venomous snakes in the world? </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, but you buy a lot from Russia to keep the costs down. If you could buy from Sweden it opens up your market which could lead to independece where you can freely choose by your liking and that will bring prices down.


Since you're a member of Nato, an outside powerline pointing away from Russian territories is certainly in your own best interest. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Swedish Jan Guillou wrote the  autobiographical novel "Evil" which movie adaption (2003) got an oscar nomination for best foreign film. 

On Topic: He also wrote a trilogy about late 12th century Sweden. Called **The Templar Knight**

**Short Synopsis:**
An unstable Sweden before it was Sweden. 

In one of families fighting with the present king is Arn who get sent to a monastery as a young boy. There he learn one of the foreign Monks once was a Templar Knight in "The Holy Land". 

About a third of books takes place in an around Jerusalem and Gaza. It tells the buildup to the Battle of Hattin and about the major characters involved in that battle.

I recommend both the books and the movies which got Stellan Skarsgrd and a lot of swedish people. Boys and girls. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I enjoy watch grrm talk,  but lately I think George have become a bit of a hypocrite. Some people will tear me a new asshole or call me unfair for criticizing him, because apparently he is God.

But here we go.. All he's ever talked about in interviews is how he like to make his readers feel unsafe when their favorite character is threatened. And I have agreed with him. I did feel unsafe reading Game of Thrones.. At least after Ned's beheading. 

But now he's changed perspective completely. Apparently it doesn't matter if you are worried about you characters when you read anymore. Now it's the "journey that matters" nevermind what he has always said before... 

I just think it would be more admirable if he faced the problem with his back straight, admitting this is not an ideal situation, but we just have to cope. 

Instead of changing his point of view to fit HBO's opinion...  </TEXT>

And who are you, the proud lord said,

that I must bow so low?

Only a cat of a different coat,

that's all the truth I know.

In a coat of gold or a coat of red,

a lion still has claws,

And mine are long and sharp, my lord,

as long and sharp as yours.

And so he spoke, and so he spoke,

that Lord of Castamere,

But now the rains weep o'er his hall,

with no one there to hear.

Yes now the rains weep o'er his hall,

and not a soul to hear. </TEXT>

As for keeping a sub like this growing. Make it look like a sub about astrophysics. Satellites, galaxies, corny stuff like that makes for a great banner together with a well designed logo.

 Keep a steady flow of interesting news, but don't drown out discussions posted by the rest. 

Oh, and I like when the link to the sub's front page in the upper left corner is in an image bigger than the small link I keep missing on my mobile/pad

<TEXT> I have a feeling that most people interpret Ice as a ceremonial blade only used for executions which I believe is not the case.

And someone please correct me if you have more facts, but Ice was the sword of the Lord of Winterfell, and has been so for thousands of years (new editions coming along every once in a while).

That means if he was going somewhere where he would bring a weapon. He would bring Ice.

<TEXT> **I have posted it,** and It's based upon Bran's dying wish to be a Knight, his probable highly magical powers and a line from Dunk and Egg 2. Dunk tells the soldier farmers to return to their homes against their Lords will saying: *"It was if some God had put the words in my mouth, not the warrior"* 

With the theory of Hodor being an ancestor to Dunk going hand in hand with this since Bran can Warg Hodor. 
Also, why begin a short story series along with your main story novels if the events weren't tightly linked and important to the whole plot. Oh, and George love Knights. Check his website.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am relistening to Clash of Kings, keeping an ear out for good foreshadowing. Some of them are pretty obvious once you know what's going on.

When Jon is about to chop Ygritte's head off George has planted some real obvious foreshadowing for R+L=J 

 nbsp;

*"He raised Longclaw over his head, both hands tight around the grip. One cut, with all my weight behind it. He could give her a quick clean death, at least. He was his fathers son. Wasnt he? Wasnt he?"*

**Two times?** That's bold of GRRM I would say. It should stand out, but it really don't if you aren't looking for it.

 nbsp;

There's also one in A Storm of Swords where Sandor Clegane to Arya riding towards The Twins is also has a witty red wedding foreshadowing that is pretty well known


*"Keep your mouth shut and do as I tell you, and maybe well even be in time for your uncles bloody wedding.*

 nbsp;

**Anyone else know a witty and/or really obvious foreshadowing that has or hasn't struck true yet?** </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Wolf Hall-post got me thinking. Game of Thrones has some of Great Britains most talented actors. Harry Lloyd is one of my favourite Brits, and should have been nominated for supporting role in "The Theory of Everything" if you ask me. I loved him in Doctor Who, a show that has a great many guest actors that stars in A Game of Thrones which I will list below. Tell me if I forgot someone.

 nbsp;

Tobias Menzies and Liam Cunningham are russian submariners.

Joe Dempsie - Gendry

Harry Lloyd - Viserys

David Bradley - Walder Frey is in Doctor Who and also plays William Hartnell (#1 Doctor) in the movie "An Adventure of Space and Time".

Iain Glenn - Jorah the Andal)

Thomas Brodie-Sangster - Jojen

Diana Rigg - Queen of Thorns

Julian Glover - Pycelle

Jamie Sives, Ron Donachie and Ian Hanmore was all in the same episode "Tooth and Claw".

Lucian Msamati - Salladhor Saan

Mark Killeen - Mero

Spencer Wilding - A White Walker who has played aliens several times in Doctor Who

Tim Plester - Black Walder Rivers

Finn Jones (Loras Tyrell) was in the spin-off The Sarah Jane Adventures

Burn Gorman (Karl Tanner) and Owen Teale (Alliser Thorne) was in the spin-off Torchwood

Donald Sumpter (Maester Luwin) and Julian Glover was in the old Who-series

 nbsp;

**Rose Leslie** has a role in the season 1 of Downton Abbey where she is great.

Any other show or film where an actor from "Thrones" is particularly *shiny*? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I watched John Oliver on net neutrality. And he got me thinking. Internet Providers basically has us in our grips. 
I will provide a personal example which I hope others will too.

Watch the very informative John Oliver explain it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpbOEoRrHyU

 nbsp;
**In Sweden**, where I don't think it is as bad as in the US, the status quo is:

*-* 3 or 4 big providers for countryside and suburbs.

 
*-* Around two more advanced providers additionally avalible in larger cities.

My sister lives three blocks from me in a smaller city, separated by a main road. I have access to one of the big ones exclusively, and she has access to the other two.

The one I've got also has cheaper service in student-apartments.

 nbsp;

If one could gather information on avalability you could possibly prove that they have areas of control for reduced competition and therefore possibly *illegal(?)* monopoly on the market. </TEXT>

<TITLE> (No Spoilers) The Elder Scrolls a lot influenced by ASOIAF? </TITLE>

<TEXT> That TES V: Skyrim was a bit influenced by A Song of Ice and Fire is certain. Dragons, The Northerners rebel against the kingdom (empire). Riften is basically Braavos and Windhelm and Winterhold makes me think of Winterfell. 
Oh, and Draugers..

But I came to thinking about TES IV: Oblivion, and Brother Martin is the **illegitimate son of Emperor Uriel Septim VII**, and the last remaining of that ancient bloodline. In the beginning of the game, he is sworn as a munk. At the end, he turns into a dragon.

Am I grasping for air, or is The Elder Scrools very influenced by A Song of Ice and Fire?
**Bethesda was almost about to make a licensed Game of Thrones!**

<TEXT> Why not. We have nothing better to do than wondering about how potatoes got to Westeros anyway.

New editions for A Song of Ice and Fire are releasing in October this year. Which could very well be Harper Voyagers way of cashing in inbetween the wait for the next big payday.

But I always keep a good look on GRRM's website. Particulary the tour-dates.
http://www.georgerrmartin.com/appearances/
The next big convention is The Pacific Northwests Science-Fiction Fantasy Convention which almost coincides with the Season 5 premier date. And after that if follows with Fantasy conventions all year long.

**Let's speculate** Our dream would come true if GRRM announces this April with a summer/autumn release. 

My more modest but still falthering hope is we have the book by Spring 2016, before season 6 starts. </TEXT>

**Any suggestions**?

"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms" is actually pretty good.

"A True Knight of Westeros" would be more eyecatching. </TEXT>

However I don't feel Dunk and Egg is quite epic enough to make it to the big screen. It's still good drama though with a good climax in each story. As I mentioned in the OP, BBC's Sherlock has a quite fitting way of doing it. With 3 episodes per year each 1 and a half hour in length. 

It could be awesome considering each novella is a separate story still connected to the other two. </TEXT>

I got it for christmas (waiting was really hard). And I have read some small portions about the Dawn age and some of the Targ kings. And I must say, though it is exceptionally interesting. The Art is really what blew my mind. Dunk vs The Laughing Storm made my jaw drop. 

**I really (really) hope HBO makes Dunk and Egg into a series. Maybe like Sherlock, with 3 episodes each year about 1 and a half hour in length."**
That would make 3 seasons. 
HBO should prepare for such a series in the Show with Bran somehow. Just hinting at it with something to make the stories intertwine a bit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> How did it go? 

I have introduced close to 10 new people, new to advanced Board Games, though they are fans of the shows and the books. 

And even though it takes several playthroughs to get a good hang off all the rules, new players seem to get a basic knowledge and after 3 or 4 rounds (if they are not afraid to ask their questions when they wonder about something). Past those rounds they can place their orders and such without any problems. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not live maybe, but after warging Hodor for a year(I'm really bad at how much time is passed) he will know how to do it just as well as he knew all the stones in the walls of Winterfell. If it's possible for him to learn to slip into his skin, staying in the back not controlling him. Particularly since he will know Hodor so well. Well

**I would like to hear theories for the reasons behind Hodor being Dunk's descendant if you don't agree if only to encourage more discussion**.  George would have a good reason for such a twist. Hodor seems like a nobody, just there to help Bran North. Why would the plot need him to be related to Dunk? Someone who probably spent a lot of time with Brandon Rivers back in the days.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> (Spoilers All) Hodor's ancestry. Bran's Castle Wall climbing is actually huge controversial foreshadowing? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-29 04:56:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **Now, are you not prepared to read a long controversial theory.** "Leave now, and never. Come back".

Firstly. Bran and *George R R Martin* shares a huge (apperently gigantic) interest. And that is **Knights.**
http://www.georgerrmartin.com/for-fans/knights/
Also note Bran was the first point of view character George wrote. And in that chapter it was the finding of the Direwolves that came to him Martin first. Warging obviously was a huge part of the whole series from the very start.

And secondly, if you are active here you have seen this theory a couple days back. I have deleted that post, rewritten some parts, and added a whole lot of foreshadowing-material and things that **could** point the right way for this. I must say though. Ever since I first thought of this in August I am getting more convinced the more I dig, so **I need people to read what I have with an open mind and say that this is not possible.**


 nbsp;


 nbsp;

*"Ofttimes a very small man can cast a very large shadow"*


**PREFACE**

This theory that I have polished for months **stands and falls with Hodor being the descendant of Ser Duncan the Tall**, (which I strongly believe he is, even if my own crazy Crackpot turns out false.) **And it would also suggest George's fantastic reason for him being the grandson/great grandson of one of the finest knights the realm ever saw.** Here I would also like to point out that Duncan lived almost 100 years before ASOIAF, and yet we will probably know more about him life than Ned Stark when George has finished his planned material.

I also want to say I am not suggesting different timelines here. What has happened has already happened. There won't be any paradoxes.

And I must say. If my theory is correct. George is hands down one of the most genious storytellers who ever lived. 

 nbsp;

**PROLOGUE**

To get started, here's 7 feet of tinfoil, make yourself a rugged but practical Greathelm and get in the saddle. Because we are are going on an adventure.


I think it's safe to say we are all waiting for The Winds of Winter. Before reading any further. Contemplate this for a moment. Who do you think sends the Winds, little lord?

We can all agree that tWoW will take Bran much deeper into the magical world, and I have always (even before I came up with this theory) believed that will be on such a scale the reader at this point has never witnessed or even dared to imagine. The winds he sends will be so significant they will be an entire aspect of the title of the whole book.
While the whole idea could and most likely will be complete nonsense. (one cup of self-distance every other day is healthy for your mental stability) It would be super-duper-mega-cool if this where to be proven right. So I beg of you. Bear with me for a moment.



**THE THEORY**

The magical abilities Bran possess is undoubtedly incredible. Jojen shat his pants when discovering he could take control of Hodor. Something even he had never heard was possible(?) Bran has had very little real training up to this point, and he has but gotten a few glimpses of what warging and Weirwood.net is capable of. We have seen him go far back in time, watching his father and sending him some rustling leaves, and Theon even heard him speak. I have a I think that will change. Bloodraven most certainly will teach Bran everything he knows, and I would bet he knows more than anyone (for now). How BR will show and teach Bran what he needs to know is totally unknown at this point though, and that is what my theory is all about.

I think he will take Bran back in time to when he was Brynden Rivers. He will get to study the life of a Targaryen prince. And, most importantly (for Bran and this theory anyway) is to let Bran do that from the eyes of a Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.. And what a Knight he will be/was! "Three whole pages for Ser Duncan the Tall.." The few times Dunk is mentioned in the novels they speak of him as one of the most honorable Knights who ever lived.

Towards what ultimate goal is Bloodraven doing this then? He will gain Bran's trust when fulfilling his deepest wish, he will show Bran that he is Brynden Rivers, A Targaryen bastard and not just a dude in a tree. Bran will be the one escorting Branden Rivers to the wall and he will also be at Summerhall, one of the series larger mysteries and the reveal will most likely be some sort of twist. The weirdest thing about this must be that he will fall in love with young Old Nan...

It makes me think Bran might learn to do what Hodor does when he's getting waged. crawl up in a corner where he cannot reach him. But he can vaguely feel his presence. Just controlling minor things that doesn't scare the crap out him.

Now, I have gotten the subtle impression GRRM has a secret love for foreshadowing. So here's what I can remember. Making it all fit together if you tilt your head a little to the left while squinting your eyes.

 nbsp;

**FORESHADOWING**

- "The Sworn Sword", Duncan the Tall: *"Go home! All of you! Back to your villages, and see if the fire's spared your homes and crops." "It was if some God had put the word in my mouth.* **Not the warrior.** *Was there a god of fools?"*

That bold line felt so out of context and the *"Not the Warrior"* -part was what sparked this whole theory when I read The Sworn Sword on my way to Spain for a vacation.

This happens when they are drilling the farmers, and is the most notorious foreshadowing I will present. And it is certainly not the first time Dunk has behaved impulsive. We know Bran is very kind to his smallfolk when serving as "Lord of Winterfell" And I can not see why Dunk would think about the gods in a moment like this. He is not a very pious man what I can recall.

**farfetched you say?** well this is the Hound to Arya: *"Keep your mouth shut and do as I tell you, and maybe we'll make it in time for your uncle's bloody wedding."* I try to remember that this is George, and he is the grandmaester of subtle (subtle) hints.

- **"Dunk the lunk, thick as a castle wall."** That is something he gets called, and often think about himself. We don't know really except it insultes Dunk's intelligence sounds extremely catchy. Him being a big fella makes it really fitting.

 nbsp;

**But let's take a step back.** In A Game of Thrones first chapters, a lot of focus lies on Bran's climbing the Walls of Winterfell. Of course it all leads up to the fall, but it is very explicitly describes how Bran has climbed them so often he knows every stone in Winterfell so well he could probably climb them sleeping (paraphrasing).
With the loss of his legs, he can't climb the Castle Walls anymore which he loved almost as much as his dream of being a Knight. But he get's part of his ability to move back with the help of Hodor. And even though this is a long shot. I can't see "Thick as a Castle Wall" as just a joke on his name. Not after I was taken from behind by "Not the Warrior"


- *"You will never walk again, but you will fly"* It is established in the first chapter of A Game of Thrones that this boy is dreaming of the glory and the tourneys. But it doesn't end there. I would say Bran thinks about his crushed dream of becoming a Knight more times than you could count, and I see that as a reminder that it is something he has not gotten over yet. Bloodraven quote here has the literal meaning. "You will Warg dragons". And it has the hidden meaning. That he will do more than he ever dreamed was possible.

- Bran's last chapter has some crazy visions. Ned basically confirms R+L=J, we get to see Lyanna fighting (I think?), possibly foretelling that she is tKotLT. We see a mystical pregnant woman who wants revenge. And we see The First men about to make a human sacrifice. (All these could and most likely is Bran's family and ancestors)

And then we see Old Nan kissing Dunk... (I suspect) Why is that important? Why are we shown that along with his family? What is Hodor if not just a way for Bran to get to point B? Why does BR first show him members of his family, and then a Hedge Knight secretly travelling with a prince?

- ASOIAF is pretty unique in it's point of view storytelling. And while the complete history of the Targaryens (tPaTQ and tRP) is written as an in universe history book. The Stories of Dunk and Egg is written from the perspective of Dunk.

- The first scene in The Hedge Knight. Ser Arlan is dead, leaning against a tree.
I don't see GRRM just making it so because it's cool. It must have a purpose, like everything else he writes.

**GRRM is planning 9 novellas about Dunk's life as a knight.** He released The Hedge Knight the same year as A Clash of Kings, 1998. And I can not fathom why he would begin writing a separate story at the same time. If the two stories were not heavily intertwined and important for the whole story I don't think he would have written the whole thing as a separate trilogy. (that is what Dunk and Egg will become when it's finished) Releasing it parallel with the novels could implicate it is really important to know about Dunk and what he did when you get to reading the later part of asoiaf.

**Also remember who has the first chapter, and remember GRRM's and Bran's extreme love for knights.**
http://www.georgerrmartin.com/for-fans/knights/

P.S. 
This could actually fall under the same theory as Bran in some way being Bran the Builder and/or some of the other notorious Brandons. Particulary Bran the Burner. His father went away and didn't return. His son Bran the Burner reacted pretty childish to me.. Setting all remaining ship ablaze. That sounds incredibly impulsive and something he probably regretted dearly after, just as Dunk regretted causing the trial by seven.

EPILOGUE

Now it's time for everyone to shoot my imaginative ass down (I put a lot of effort into this, so shoot me gently).
Otherwise add something. (I would like to read every Bran chapter word for word.. Got any knowledge of him wishing to be taller?) **Discussion is all we have until date unknown, and I wish to cherish that.**

**If you don't agree**
If you don't agree with this at all (say so, and then join the discussion about Hodor and Dunk.
I would like to hear other theories about what the point is of him being the descendant of possibly the most honorable knight in history and why that never being discussed! </TEXT>

it doesn't matter if your post is misinformed, far-fetched or dumb! As long as you make your point, don't break the rules or make a rude comment and most importantly **DON'T TROLL** people shouldn't downvote you no matter how stupid the post is. (Well.. There are exceptions confirming the rules)

**And that is what you and many others hasn't understood. 

People downvote posts because they think what the OP asks, states or thinks is misinformed and or just doesn't agree with their opinion.

And all this brings down interesting discussions.

<TITLE> (No Spoilers) In Regards to Voting on this subreddit </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-28 19:04:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> And I know the reason why that is.

**Upvotes/Downvotes are NOT Reddit's version of Facebook's "like button" (Or the much wanted dislike-button).**

(**Yes, I realize this post could be subject of extreme irony**.)

I think people on this subreddit misuse the downvotes incredibly often. People put a lot of effort in putting out theories, asking good questions and starting discussions about this and that, only to have the posts downvoted to the bottom by people who just doesn't agree.

**And I think that hurts this sub a whole lot!**


So, I provided the rules (not more like guidelines. actual rules) for votes. Which actually are pretty hard to find if you are not an experienced redditor.


- **Please don't downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it.** Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, **rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.**

- Please don't Mass downvote someone else's posts. If it really is the content you have a problem with (as opposed to the person), by all means vote it down when you come upon it. But don't go out of your way to seek out an enemy's posts.

- Upvote or downvote based just on the person that posted it. Don't upvote or downvote comments and posts just because the poster's username is familiar to you. Make your vote based on the content.

**FAQ**
 
##24. Someone made a mistake in their post or comment! **Did they even read the book? Should I downvote them?**
No. If you can do it nicely, feel free to correct them and move on. If you cant do it nicely, just move on.


**To my astonishment** jsdistasio **pointed out that this sub is one of the most downvoting on Reddit as a research done about a year ago points out.**

**Some people doesn't like Roy Dotrice as a reader though. But I quite love him!**

I would say it is not the best way to consume the series if you are interested in theories and such. You miss hidden details whie listening and can't stay and go back a line to analyze. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are probably a lot of huge fans out there who read the books but hasn't experienced the greatness of **The Tales of Dunk and Egg.**

I want to take this moment to fully acknowledge the fantastic quality of the three published novellas and I urge fans who have not read them to do so.

It is a much softer read than the novels and I would say the quality of the stories are spectacular. You really sympathize with Duncan, and I would say they are mostly pretty feel-good. Something that is rare in this universe we all adore so much.

No one of my friends who are fans have read The Tales of Dunk and Egg yet (despite my warm recommendations), and 
I suspect because it is because they have no idea who those characters are (only being mentioned a couple of times in the novels).

**Do yourself a favor and read them. You won't regret it.** </TEXT>

We also know he has interactions with BR. 
More crackpot is that it may be revealed in the next book, and that's why Dunk and Egg 4 was postponed and replaced with The Princess and the Queen. Supposedly the next Dunk and Egg will take place in Winterfell/The North  </TEXT>

Decendants of** the first men and named after the volcanic caves that has been the center of a fortified hill by the Cinders since the time of the dragons. Some say the volcanic rockfomations (which has give the house it's name) surrounding the cave were created by a stray dragon.

House Cinder were awarded **Strongsong** recently for their **unexpected loyalty** to the Lords of the Vale in the War of the Ninepenny Kings. Lord Cinder managed to still the warrior's want for the spoils of war when the still outlawed mountain clans rode to war with Lord Ormund Baratheon. Lord Cinder knew war was coming to The Vale. It was just a matter of time. 

**The current Lord Cinder**, **"Burk"** recieved the hand of Marinera Corbray. The youngest daughter of Ser Arman Corbray who is 8th in the line of succession to Hearts Home. Together they have recieved two sons aged 13 and a daughter of 7,

House Cinder's **military forces** consists of 2000 fierce and utterly fearless warriors wielding two-handed weapons. 100 mounted noblemen and 900 archers/crossbowmen

Staying true to the vows made to the Lords of the Vale would grant rewards to the those who were patient. </TEXT>

It was obviously not supposed to be a part of the story when it was written in the 1980's. Ten years before GRRM even knew that Jon Snow know nothing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, the perfect steppingstone to introduce young readers to the universe?**

I just visited my local bookstore and after I had drooled over "The World of Ice and Fire" for a minute I noticed this book:

http://s.cdon.com/media-dynamic/images/product/book/book/image0/riddaren_av_de_sju_konungarikena-martin_george_r_r-27265257-2403511085-frntl.jpg

This is the Swedish version of "A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms". And I now recall GRRM stating that the book might get an early release for some countries.

**I got an idea that it could be a great gift for my nephew.**
But before even asking my sister if it's ok I wanted to ask here if you think the novellas are ok for a 10 year old child to read.
He probably have more hours on **Skyrim** than I have, which certainly contains a great deal of violent.

It was a long time ago since I read the Dunk and Egg stories, so I just wonder if anyone here knows if there it contains scenes that might not be ok for a child to read? 
**I thought it might be ok, since there are no sex-scenes in these stories what I can recall. Yet. And the story has a protagonist about the same age as my nephew.**

Would love for someone with a good memory to help me out. 

**This could be the perfect gateway-drug for kids today to grow up with George R R Martin's universe, and if they are lucky A Dream of Spring might release just in time for their graduation**  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes he is. And this is my theory.

Bran will be able to weirwood.Net-warg Duncan the Tall because he is Hodor's great grandfather. And therefore fulfilling his life's wish of becoming a knight in some sense. (And what a knight).
This is an idea of my own that came to me when I read a passage in "The Sworn Sword" that read something like this: "It was if some God had put the words in my mouth. Not the warrior. Was there a god of fools?".
It could explain why Dunk acts recklessly without thinking. And also fits in to some great lesson given to Bran by Bloodraven. Bran gets to meet Brynden Rivers in his physical prime and learn about the history of Westeros culminating with the mystery of Summerhall. </TEXT>

One theory is that Hr. Brother to Baldr.
Baldr is immortal except for his weakness to mistletoe.

Baldr was tricked by Loki to kill Baldr with an mistletoe arrow.

This could mean Bran safe in the cave where magic protects him from the magic of the Others represents Baldr and Hr is Hodor tricked by another part to kill Bran.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, we basically have confirmation that Dany will get het whole A Dance with Dragons storyline. (maybe a chapter or so less)

But where will the other characters end up?
**I thought I would fill up this OP with the best theories.**


* **Tyrion** - Ends up practically where book 5 ends. fAegon and JonCon is cut, meeting Ser Jorag and possibly meeting Dany.
* **Bran** -  Confirmed to be stalled one season to catch up with the book with character progress possibly happening behind the scenes.
* **Arya** She should begin her training this season if she is gonna go back to Westeros at the end of season 6. Maybe reaching the Mercy-chapter by the end of this season.
* **Sansa** Filler material. Hopefully gathering the support of the knights of the Vale.
* **Cersei (Whole Kings Landing plotline)** - Maybe as far as the Trial by Combat. Possibly a Maggy the Frog flashback.
* **Jaime** (We know he's going to Dorne, so this covers that plot. Hope for some Bronn development)
* **Brienne** (  Pod) IF they have not cut out Lady Stoneheart completely, she will surface in the last episodes of season 5, threatening to hang Brienne and Pod. if LSH is cut. Your guess is as good as mine what Brienne will do.
* **Jon (The whole North plotline)** - Is elected LC, stabbed and possibly ressurected by end of this season. **GOD. I can't wait for unsullied to get this cliffhanger episode**
* **Sam** If they go with him leaving he probably will be meeting Arya in Braavos before season 5 is over at least, then onwards south.
* **Iron Islands** - Chances are this story will be cut save for Ashas involvement in the North.

Any strong feelings on how they will end next season? I managed to predict season 4 mostly, with some things they cut out and such.

<TEXT> **Sanzoku no Musume Ronja**, the japanese Anime, co-produced by Studio Ghibli have aired a few episodes.
Based on the swedish movie **"Ronja Rvardotter"** And the book by the same name written by **Astrid Lindgren** http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrid_Lindgren

I really like it so far. It is fairly true to it's swedish inspiration, something that surprised me. My favourite scene is in the second episode. But I like the original swedish version of that scene far better.
link to the scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdAkrQFO-xQ

This is my most tinfoil-branded theory. But hey! **That's what we do.**

**Bran** will be able to weirwood.Net-warg **Duncan the Tall** because he is Hodor's great grandfather. And therefore fulfilling his life's wish of becoming a knight in some sense. (And what a knight).
This is an idea of my own that came to me when I read a passage in **"The Sworn Sword"** that read something like this: **"It was if some God had put the words in my mouth. Not the warrior. Was there a god of fools?".**

It could explain why Dunk acts recklessly, childish and without thinking soemtimes. And it also fits in to some great lesson that will be given to Bran by **Bloodraven.** Bran gets to meet Brynden Rivers in his physical prime and learn about the history of Westeros culminating with the mystery of **Summerhall.**

I know its pretty crazy. But I have wondered why GRRM began writing about **Dunk and Egg** in the first place. They are obviously important to the story. And since he began around the release of **A Clash of Kings** he probably already had Bran's fate decided since long ago. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exactly. Probably the best movie ever to show someone unfamiliar with anime.

And one more thing. Studio Ghibli's movies always has this realistic feeling. People act like normal people would, living ordinary lives. Nothing has this unrealistic flawlessness that comes to mind when you think of Disney's films. (oh I do have some Disney favourites, fear you not)

Halfway in I was completely sure it had to be based on a true story. It had so much emotions and experiences that would be completely alien to someone who hadn't lived through these events.
I love books and films based on true stories,  and decided to look it up when the the movie would end.

**And then the ending came.**
I think I cried halfway through the credits, and then I looked up the book and the true story. (semi autobiography)
It is written as a tribute and an apology.

And apparently the ending is shown exactly like it happend IRL.

The most powerful movie I have seen this year. 
**If you havn't seen this film. Do it.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> I posted a thread, but didn't get a sollution, so here goes.

Installed MechJeb for the first time. But it doesnt execute maneuver nodes.
It gets to the target altitude, firing stages and doing gravity turns.

But when it get out of the atmosphere, nothing more happens.

<TEXT> No it doesn't make any corrections after leaving the atmosphere and change to "Autopilot Status: Coasting to circularization burn". 

Just goes past and downward after that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a complete ship with batteries and solar panels, but when it didn't work the first time I made a new save file in sandbox to see if it was a technology problem. Didn't put that much effort into the test rocket. 

The speed was probably due to "limit to terminal velocity".

Added stuff electrical stuff, and changed the turn shape a little.

New picture shows altitude at 62 000 km. past the node at 75 000 and now descending.
Still not working. :(

<TITLE> Mechjeb - "Ascent Guidance" won't circularize/execute node </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-20 01:37:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> SOLVED!



I'm tired of launcing and rendevouzing so I just installed Mechjeb.
Got it to work, it is great at getting in the air.

Although it won't work entirely. It creates a node at apoapsis, but just goes right past it without buring. 

Autopilot Status: "Coasting to circularization burn". and it says so until the shit hits the fan (ground).

I have RCS, 3 kerbals and a little fuel left in my mainsail and a third stage ready. I don't get it because it manage to drop first stage, do the gravitational turn and set the manuever node at set orbit altitude.
But it won't execute the node.

Anyone have any ideas? This is so frustrating! </TEXT>

<TITLE> (Spoilers ADWD) Characters story paused for S5! Winds of Winter 2015 possible? </TITLE>

<TEXT> I **hate** being one of those persons posting a thread with the name of the next book in the title. But I have no choice.

Just read an interview with Kristian Nairn (Hodor) where he said:
"**We** have a season off and we have a year's hiatus, solely because I imagine our storyline is up to the end of the books," 

The whole interview here:
https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/24890664/actor-kristian-nairn-reveals-the-other-side-of-hodor-on-game-of-thrones-themed-dj-tour/

As he said "**We** have a season off" I guess that means his gang. That be Hodor, Bran and Meera. Oh, and Brynden "Bloodraven" Rivers ofc.

They totally have rushed Bran's storyline and I would never have suspected they would pause his story for a whole season, that seem really weird considering the huge twist at the end.

if they now feel they should take a break with Bran for a season because there is no more book material. Is that an indication that **The Winds Of Winter** could well be released 2015? Maybe in time for season 5 to end, or worst case before season 6 airs?

If there were no chance George would have the book out before season 6 is well under way I see no reason what so ever to delay Bran's storyline at all. Just make him a flashback-machine.

I take delaying of story as a good sign. That should mean they feel **hope.** And that is good enough for me.

However I am glad. I don't want weirwoodspoilers in the show.
And I am sure we will get clarifications from D D what the holdup is all about soon enough. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Theory about the powers of the Weirwood trees and Bran's extreme warg abilities.

Spoilers D E

I read The Sworn Sword on the plane just before, and smiled a lot when I read the part where Dunk defies his former liege and sends his soon to be slaughtered smallfolk home. 
The reason for my smile was Dunks monolouge after his outburst:
 "It was if some God had put the words in my mouth. Not the warrior" 
"Was there a god of fools?"

"not the warrior" felt a little out of place, and got me thinking towards the old gods. 

We do know about someone who can control people. And we know someone who wants to be a Knight more than anyone. 

This could well be wishful thinking and another crackpot theory. BUT IF Bran theoretically could Warg someone in the past (weirwood magic seems pretty craycray you got to admit) do you have a better candidate than Dunk the lunk, thick as a castle wall? 
I bet we will know if it's the jetlag, or if I'm on to something in Winds of Winter and or The Shewolves Of Winterfell. 

In any case, I think Dunk and Egg is really important to the story of the novels. He began writing the novellas between agot and acok I believe.
