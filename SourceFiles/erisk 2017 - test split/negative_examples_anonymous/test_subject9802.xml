---  
Miss you terribly already  
Miss the space between your eyelids,  
Where I'd stare through awkward sentences  
And void through awkward silence    

 nbsp;  

Miss your teeth when they chatter,  
When we smoked out in my garden  
When we couldn't sleep for all the heat,  
Soft talk began to harden    
  
 nbsp;  
  
Miss your small hands in the palm of mine,  
The fact they're good at making  
Miss you sitting up incessantly,  
And the fact you're always waking in the night  
And night    
  
 nbsp;  
  
And I,  
I hope for your life  
You forget about mine  
Forget about mine    

 nbsp;  
  
Miss your teeth dug in my shoulder,  
As we rolled in early morning,  
Miss your arm dying beneath me,  
As I lay there, simply yawning    
  
 nbsp;  
  
Please forget me, you were right dear  
I am cold and self-involved  
And though I'll miss you, recent lover  
I am weak and therefore fold    
  
 nbsp;  
  
Get distracted by my music,  
Think of nothing else but art  
I'll write my loneliness in poems,  
If I can just think how to start    
  
 nbsp;  
  
Dot my I's with eyebrow pencils,  
Close my eyelids, hide my eyes,  
I'll be idle in my ideals,  
Think of nothing else but I  
I
And I    
  
 nbsp;  
  
And I  
I hope for your life  
You can forget about mine  
Just forget about mine    
  
 nbsp;  
  
Oh, mine  
Mine   </TEXT>

<TEXT> You wrote this like a beat poet. 

I'm sorry for the salt in the wound, but all in all it sounds like it was all for the best. Not everyone is the same; not everyone is capable of monogamy and it seems like you and your ex were fundamentally different. Was it wrong for her to not tell you her true intent? Yes. Can you blame her, though? That's a tough pill to swallow and it sounds like you and she will live a happier life doing your own thing. I honestly just hope for the best for your daughter and that she doesn't get introduced to a rotating door of weird partners via your wife and her new man.  

Also, get checked for STD's like everyone else has said. </TEXT>

<TEXT> True. Very good point. I thought I was okay with it but hearing them occupy the one bathroom for 45 minutes to fuck is kind of annoying... And then loudly fucking twice more, once while I'm trying to work from home is a little more than I bargained for, so I kind of just made the change of heart today. </TEXT>

It's just hard to see myself in their shoes because I've been there (but always lived alone with a partner) and it was not fun. </TEXT>

Beyond that, I just have never really liked the idea of living with a couple. Especially new couples. No matter how well we get along and how well we know each other,  it's still a new relationship and things could change for the worse.

Also, to be completely honest, I've never felt as comfortable hanging out with the guy alone without her there to facilitate the conversation so, meh.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Me [26F] with my room mates of two years [26F   24M]; My two room mates recently started hooking up   still want me to look for 3 bedroom apartments with them. Is it wrong or selfish that I feel really uncomfortable about this? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-25 04:32:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The three of us all met when we moved into this apartment and have fortunately gotten along really well. The two of them have always seemed close but aside from my friends joking to me that they seem to have chemistry, nothing has really happened.  

 nbsp;  

Somewhere over the last few weeks, they've started hooking up. Honestly, I'm not surprised at all by this and I think they would make a great couple, but what bothers me is the fact that we had intended to look for new apartments together as our lease ends in August. When they found out I knew, we had a chat and discussed options and both of them seemed surprised that I was hesitant to move into a new place with them.  

 nbsp;  

Ive never found myself in a situation like this and I dont know if all three of us living together is the best idea. I could honestly live with it, but its not my preferred option. I mentioned to them that I would rather one of them live elsewhere but now, honestly, I think that the girl would just end up resenting me for breaking up "the group" or think I'm a tightass or something.  

 nbsp;  

After a long talk with them and consulting some friends, I decided that maybe I was just being sensitive and that I should just suck it up and give it a shot. We all get along so well and we all know we like living together so it's possible it could work... But this is all uncharted waters for me and I'm having second thoughts. We looked at a new apartment today and we would have signed for it if the landlord hadn't found a more long term candidate and I'm honestly relieved. I can't help it, but hearing them fucking makes me incredibly uncomfortable and almost like a "prisoner" in my own home and a thirdwheel amongst my room mates. I feel incredible guilt that I'm reacting this way. I feel unreasonable and childish that I can't just nut up about it but I keep going back and forth between acceptance, anger, sadness and anxiety about my living situation.  

 nbsp;  

**tl;dr**: I love my room mates of two years, but ever since they started hooking up (past few weeks) I no longer feel comfortable living in my apartment with them. Am I being unreasonable?

 nbsp;

**UPDATE:** Thanks for all your help and advice, all! It means a lot to hear so many different opinions. I sent a text to my room mates that said:
"Hey guys, I've been thinking about this and I think I need to give up the search. It's been great living with you both and I love you both but I just dont think I am ready to take on a new apartment. I probably am going to stay at the current place until I get my finances more in order. I think you two should continue to look for a place together, though."  
 nbsp;

Hopefully they'll be understanding and the next few months won't be super awkward... </TEXT>

<TITLE> 26/F/BOS (USA) - Anywhere that will teach me how to be self sufficient and live off of natural resources </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-17 20:43:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey there. I just discovered this sub and I'm not really sure how exactly I can change my life but I'm looking for any and all advice/help in getting things together.  

First a little history:  

 I grew up never really knowing what home was. I was abused, put into the foster care system and bounced around from 14-18. Never really knew anything about my father until I was 16 and reached out to him.  

My mom is a third generation American (Irish) and my father is an Israeli (his mother was born in Yemen, from what I understand). I grew up poor and without anyone teaching me how to be self sufficient. I had to learn all of that the hard way. From what I understand, my father was wealthy until he was arrested in 1988 for drug trafficking (he was the head of a local cocaine ring) and left us with nothing (the government seized everything and my mom tried to bribe him so he severed completely with the hopes that we would contact him later in life).  

Basically, for me, I just want to run away. I'm sick of the life I have and I've often dreamed of just getting out and living somewhere I can just garden, hunt, fish and live in the wilderness away from most people. I'm sick of having my income go mostly to keeping a roof over my head and bills, yet still not being able to afford to pay off my debt because I practically break even every month.  

The catch is that I don't have the skills to really live off the land and want so badly to be taken on as someone's apprentice (so to speak). I want to learn it all. I want to get out of the city and work my way up to being completely self sufficient. I'm at the point where I want to just drop everything and walk away from my life. I virtually want to commit suicide of my former self and just find the happy, free person that is dying to get out.  

Maybe this won't reach anyone that can help me, but even the slightest suggestions would matter so much to me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's okay, spunky monkey has a stick up his/her ass. While it's possible for the dog to have been flicked with water; it's doubtful the dog would stay in place while that happens to him (even if OP is holding a treat, a dog would think the flicking motion was OP throwing it and likely stand up). Also, we can't see the other side of the vest so we don't know if it's not drool or rainwater (it was sprinkling where I live today) or anything. Some people just really love to claim animal abuse with little to no evidence...  
I'm not absolving OP because my claims are as good as any other schmuck, but let's give OP benefit of the doubt.   SpunkyMonkey has already commented on this thread the same accusation quite a few times.

<TEXT> I do not... I'm actually asking reddit because I'm too ashamed to let my colleagues and my boyfriend know I need help. It's a psychological crutch; I was abused growing up and made to feel like I didn't deserve anyone's help and that it's shameful to admit you need it. I don't know why, but auctioning my art to strangers feels so much emotionally safer. I have a paypal account, but I don't even know how to set up a gofundme... Maybe I'm just being pathetic. I also unloaded a LOT of info on my thread and I don't want to inundate anyone any more than I already have... 

Thank you so much for your kind words, though. I've been struggling for months and now with the health issues, it's all kind of bubbled over.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Edit:** I feel like I've received enough kindness from the wonderful users of reddit to close this. Thank you to every kind person who donated, offered advice, kind words, or commissioned me. I'm currently working on art for all of the redditors who donated/comissioned. I will be PMing you all directly with a photo of the progress/finished piece and we'll work out how to get in in your hands directly!   

For anyone curious, [here is my art on tumblr](http://faunus-crypticus.tumblr.com). I'm always happy to take commissions or barter; just keep in mind I have about 4 out 5 paintings that need to be finished first, so it may take a few days - week before I can take on anything new.  

**Thanks again to everyone; I plan on paying it forward as often as I can in any way, shape or form. You all have touched me very profoundly with your kindness.

<TEXT> Like, when something he says or does causes me to get anxious and I ask him to watch his tone of voice because it's stressing me out, he'll change his inflection to sound pleading/frustrated about what he did wrong, as well as gesticulate with his hands and it stresses me out more and just causes me to shut down more and idk how to explain to him that it's not unheard of for people who've suffered abuse to be hyper vigilant to body language... Does that make sense? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's weird, but after years of interacting with people, you just kind of *can* by hearing what someone says and by their body language just kind of knowing what it is they want.. Mind you, I work at a bar so I have gotten really good at remembering orders based on the "type" of person and repeating their order back to them. Usually I can remember orders for up to ten people and even remember what they got long after.... Now, names on the other hand are a completely different issue... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was living with my aunt, uncle and their two kids (8   10) when I was 14. I was recently put into the state's custody because my mom was an abusive alcoholic. My uncle and his family were kind enough to take me in. I was there for four months when in June, the day before my last day of freshman year in high school he just... suddenly froze up in his chair and reached for my aunt (she and I were standing right there talking to him as he was complaining about "heartburn"). It was terrifying; my aunt yelled for me to call 911 but I couldn't move.... That's when his sons came downstairs and made the situation even tougher- they kept asking their dad to wake up. I ended up having to take them to a neighbor's house when the EMT's arrived. I found out later that night that he was pronounced dead on the scene. The wake was very strange to experience. </TEXT>

Over worked, underpaid social workers and thankless families giving them hell. Plenty of my foster parents only took me in for the money. Glad to hear you got your life in order, though!

<TEXT> The thesaurus is a great source! Any smartphone has a thesaurus in conjunction with the dictionary app. Type in a word, find something similar.

<TEXT> Depression/suicide awareness. I feel like so many people are depressed but so few people have the tact or understanding to be a supportive friend to someone struggling with depression. So many people give advice but usually all someone wants is to *not* talk or think about their issues. That's what a therapist is for. We just want to be distracted as a way to be cheered up.  

Also, eating disorders. There isn't a whole lot of understanding with the kind of addiction and struggle that ED sufferers endure. A lot of people think it's about vanity when it very rarely is, or, if it started out that way, it never is the reason for persisting.  </TEXT>

At that point, I figured "fuck it" and I walked back and said "yeah, I do. I can't believe you asked me that, but whatever. I'm not ashamed." He was surprised I answered, but I'd rather come off as confident than have them make up their own stories for what I choose to do in my personal life. *shrug* </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'll post more in the comments as I continue to write this out. I just really need to get this out somewhere... I apologize for my crappy writing skills.  


Its been a long time since Ive openly written about what my life was like growing up.  A part of me has been putting it off because Im not sure how vividly I remember it but despite the amount of time Ive had to move past it, I am still affected by it somewhat regularly.  


First off, a little backstory may help:  
Before I was born, my mother was married to an Israeli man. I have an older brother who was born in 1986. I am not sure how long she had been with my father prior to that, but I was born two years later.
My mother was a model in the eighties. Nothing noteworthy, but from what I gather, she did well for herself. She was a beautiful woman and met my father through a friend of hers. My father was a wealthy businessman who owned a limousine service and invested in a few local restaurants. My father had property in NY and MA; possibly more, but I am not certain.  
In 1988, my father was arrested for drug charges that pointed to him as the leader of a Brookline cocaine ring. Based on the legal documents I could find, he had been responsible for trafficking somewhere in the realm of 350 kilos of cocaine from 1986 to 1988 and was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison.  


Growing up, I didnt know my father. I knew of him through idle mention, but my mother had already settled down with a new man during my infancy. As far as I was concerned, my stepfather David was whom I called daddy. Growing up, I remember him as a very good father- he was goofy, loving, supportive, etc. He was the co-owner of a motel in Old Orchard Beach, Maine where we would spend the majority of our summers. My childhood seemed pretty great in a general sense- I was provided food, shelter, and often, love. From an early age, however, my parents fought a lot. I used to be a pretty happy and outgoing toddler, but there was often fighting in the home that my brother and I would bear witness to.  
I suppose I should preface that mother is bipolar. Being the youngest and most sensitive child, I was often subjected to psychological, physical and emotional abuse at the hands of my mother. Children are inherently needy; they rely on their parents to be a support system during their upbringing and, while I was provided with a lot of love and great experiences growing up, there was an insidious darkness in our home that grew steadily over time.  


To summarize what life was like growing up, here are a few memories I have, both good and bad, in as close to chronological order as my memory will allow.  

* 	My mother used to sing songs to me while running her nails through my hair as I fell asleep. I often asked her to sing me sad songs because from an early age, I was all too familiar with crying myself to sleep (and the deep comfort it brought)


*	My mother threw wonderful, extravagant Christmas parties for her friends that were always such a joy to participate in. The preparation it took prior, however, weighed on her and she often took it out on my brother and me. One vivid memory I have was of her slapping me and shoving my face into a cookie wrapper I left on my bedroom floor; she shamed me like an owner shames their dog for having an accident.


*	If I wasnt polite or if I spoke out of line, I would be smacked on the mouth and shamed into submission. My aunt recalls a time that she took me into the city during one of her visits; she said that I waited for her at the door with my little suitcase packed and refused to leave the doorway. She bought me a stuffed Pumba doll from the Disney store and when I came home, I insisted that it was okay that I had it because it was on sale and that I wasnt a burden and/or hadnt coaxed my aunt into buying me frivolous things.


* 	One time, my mother stabbed my stepdad with a steak knife. My brother, stepdad and I spent the night in a motel and he called us out of school the next day. I dont remember much, but I remember sitting in silence in his car in the rain while he thought about what to do. We returned home the next day.


*	In middle school, I remember my mother beating me and mocking/shaming me particularly bad. I was already picked on pretty bad in school and didnt want to show up puffy faced and disheveled, so I skipped school and instead hid in our family van. Since I didnt have a watch, I returned home at what I thought was an appropriate time, only to be berated further.


*	Some nights, when I couldnt sleep, my mother and I used to dance to Roy Orbison records in our pajamas until I was tired. 


*	During thunder storms, my mother allowed my brother and me to draw on all of the mirrors and windows with washable markers.


* 	My mom was amazing at sewing and often created our Halloween costumes, wedding clothes, holiday garb, etc. from scratch. The house was always decorated beautifully for holidays, and my mother made the most creative Easter baskets, threw the most fun Easter egg hunts, etc. 


	When my mother was a good mom, she was the best. When she was bad mom, she really made life a living hell. My stepdad is the kind of man that secretly needs a woman to bully or control him. I spent my whole childhood believing that it was normal for my dad to sleep on the couch downstairs. He did his best to protect me when he was home and I always idolized him as my protector and my best friend. Despite his aloof urgings, I was still subjected to consistent, sporadic shaming, beatings, mockery and threats. My own mother would get drunk nightly and call me a cunt; I was told that I was a loser, unwanted, a drama queen, etc. on a too-regular basis. The mother I loved was the living embodiment of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. For fourteen years, I familiarized my beautiful mother as the volatile monster, dormant only when she was left alone to sit in the pantry and chain smoke cigarettes and binge on Coors Light. 


	After fourteen years and countless character and body shaming, physical and psychological beatings, and having to carry my mother to bed drunk, my mother kicked my stepdad out. Loud fights, name-calling and character bashing were a nightly occurrence and my stepdad just endured the abuse like a prisoner afflicted with Stockholm syndrome. It was less than a week later that I followed; I had confessed to my therapist that my mother had beaten me pretty badly on our staircase (the first confession I outwardly made to my therapist, or anyone else, in fourteen years). I was sick of being treated like garbage, and since my stepfather was gone, the abuse only got worse. I remember so vividly the moment my therapist, Gerarda, asked me if I was certain that I wanted to make such a claim, because it would change my life forever. I told her I was, but I had no idea how much my life would change from there.

<TEXT> Hey all!

I just got a new job as a cocktail waitress at a bar specializing in whiskey/whisky... A lot of patrons will ask for suggestions on recommendations for a good bourbon/scotch/rye of varying conditions/batches/etc.

I was curious what r/whiskey thought about some solid go-to's and why.

[Here is the full spirits list for anyone curious.](http://www.saloondavis.com/documents/Saloon_Bourbon8.9.13.pdf) It changes often, so anything outside of this is encouraged, too, but try to stick to the list if you can :)

Thanks! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, I just started a new job as a hostess at a local restaurant and not even a week in I was asked if I would be interested in cocktail waitressing. I have server experience and a really great analytical memory, so I enthusiastically agreed... Cut to yesterday, I show up for my shift and was pulled aside from the (lead?) bartender and asked if I was interested in bartending. I was honest about my lack of experience which he seemed fine with (he said he prefers training new bartenders over acclimating existing bartenders with attitudes). I am heading in on Sunday to do a little training and I'm extremely nervous. I've been in myriad positions where I've had to learn on the fly, and the staff seems to really like me here but I can't help but feel like they're insane for asking me two weeks into my new job.  
  

Any help or advice on how to kick ass and learn fast would be appreciated, along with any useful tips that any new bartender should know. There's a possibility this is just a trial run and won't end up with an actual bar position, but I want to be prepared for all possible outcomes.  
  


**TL;DR:** I was asked if I wanted to be a bartender with no previous bartending experience because my managers think I am organized and a fast learner (I presume). Please help with tips/opinions in any way!  
  

Thanks for reading :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep! I remember refusing to participate in swim class in high school and my gym teacher made me do laps walking around the pool. He also gave me a VHS of [My First Mister](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E24SGpVrs-s) because the girl in it reminded him of me. In retrospect, it was kind of creepy that he put that much thought into it, and the title is kind of wtf. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Note the fanny pack in the first photo... I don't even know what to say about those earrings, either. Heh, I remember he used to joke around and wear my **scrunchies** and jokingly call himself "Tina" in order to mess with my cousin and me... How he turned out to be a *relatively normal* human being is beyond me.

He also was diagnosed with [vitiligo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitiligo) when he was a freshman in high school. He used to get picked on a lot because he wore makeup to cover the blotches. He was able to stop the progression of it by doing radiation, I believe. By the time he graduated, he was one of the most popular kids in high school. Complete 180. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My mother is bipolar and an alcoholic. She abused me growing up until I was 14 and reported her to my therapist. I went into the state's custody and bounced around from home to home. It was hell and I was completely fucked up from it but I became stronger as a result and after a LOT of hard work and seeking therapy/medication/help and not holding grudges or pointing fingers, I'm starting to really like who I've become. It isn't easy because I'm a very sensitive person and certain comments and events will trigger knee-jerk reactions where I can act emotionally or get angry at someones insensitivity but I think if I didn't persevere, I'd be a completely different and much sadder person... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I meet amazing people all the time just by being open and not intrusive.... Just the other night I met someone who I talked to for 3 hours and he told me "I'm telling you things I don't even tell my closest friends!"
I just am really open, honest and curious about people and what they do or what makes them tick, so asking about their life and being genuine has always been what works for me. 
I also draw or write whenever I sit at a bar, which usually instigates people to inquire what I'm doing and it just kind of goes from there... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Believe it or not, tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, etc are all fruits, despite being regarded as veggies. 
Vegetables are basically lettuces, root vegetables like carrots, etc as their seeds aren't contained/protected by the fruit (save for a few examples like strawberries where the seeds are outside) </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's $28 for 4 fl. oz... I believe $90 is for the 16 oz.

e: It's so dense and rich that it really only requires a small amount of conditioner. I used to use it when I got it for free when I worked in body care and it made my hair feel like bunny rabbit hair. It is amazing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [This is pretty great, albeit expensive...](http://www.johnmasters.com/hr.htm)

Also, try not shampooing your hair except for once a week or less, and only using conditioner. You can rinse your hair with raw apple cider vinegar (1 tablespoon to 1 cup water) and massage it into your hair and let it sit for a few minutes, rinse with water and apply conditioner... Shampoo strips your hair of natural oils which causes your scalp to try to compensate for the lost oils and also the shampoo just dries out your hair follicles... </TEXT>

<TEXT> My father was arrested in 1988 for being the leader of an Israeli cocaine ring. I think the story about his lifestyle and subsequent arrest would make an interesting story. My mom was also a model and a bipolar alcoholic and I ended up in foster care after 14 years of abuse and witnessed a lot of fucked up stuff in the system... I've always joked how cool it would be as a movie/documentary, even though growing up really sucked...

<TEXT> Awww, the poor little guy! I genuinely think, while a lot of cats don't form emotional bonds to their owners in the way that people assume dogs do, cats that have gone through significant trauma and were rescued really are capable of recognizing it. I think it's cute that you gave him his tail and he tried to get cleaned up for you. You're a good cat mom!  </TEXT>
