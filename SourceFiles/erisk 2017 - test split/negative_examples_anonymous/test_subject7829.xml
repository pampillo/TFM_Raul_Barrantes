<TEXT> With the exception of 1976 and the three-party elections of the Bill Clinton Era, when the Democratic share of the vote actually went down, but Clinton won some Southern states due to Perot, the GOP swept the field in the South after 1964. The democratic share of the congressional delegations from the south more gradually deteriorated as incumbents held on, often by becoming Republicans in all but name (Zell Miller comes to mind.)

The whole discussion is confused by the fact that the political parties were not as ideologically aligned back then as they are now. There were plenty of Republicans more liberal than most Southern Democrats.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Those links show exactly the trend I was talking about... there was clearly a shift in the Republican attitude towards Civil Rights after Goldwater won the nomination in '64 and then with Nixon's Southern Strategy (yes, 5 deep southern states went for Wallace, but the rest went for Nixon.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> The racist white southerners voted for Democrats locally and at the State level but GOP at the national level? For Senators and Congressmen?

Correct. That voting pattern persisted for decades and is well-documented.

30 out of 32 GOP Senators voted for the CRA.

What CRA are you talking about? The Community Reinvestment Act?

Why would racist white southerners vote for Democrats locally who didn't push civil rights but a national GOP that did?

Because the GOP was to the right of the Democrats on Civil Rights on a national level after 1964. Goldwater and Nixon were seen as being more sympathetic to Southern white "interests" than LBJ and Humphrey. 

P.S. LBJ was a southern Democrat

So was Al Gore. Politics is strange.

<TEXT>  1) The Republican party lost the the black American vote over civil rights in the 60's. 

More accurately, the Democratic Party lost the *white* Southern vote in the 60's due to Civil Rights, then the GOP lost the black vote as they swept in to pick up those voters. At the time, the Republicans were trading a smaller voting bloc for a bigger one. Smart politics. At the time. But karma's a bitch. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not necessarily. To be regarded as scientifically valid, a phenomenon needs to be replicable. Most reports of "supernatural" phenomena indicate an unpredictable and sporadic pattern of occurrence. A person might claim to experience precognition, or see a "ghost" once or twice in a lifetime. This could very well be because such phenomena do not in fact exist, and are the result of malfunctioning brains or sense organs, but if they do exist, this unpredictable pattern could be why they have never been scientifically proven.

Another thing to consider is the relationship between subjective states and physical objects. Some subjective states (for example, seeing the color red) have a physical correlate (an object that emits light in the red wavelengths). These states can thus be studied by science in an indirect manner since their causes are known, even if the exact relationship between the object and the subjective state it engenders is still a matter of fierce debate.

However, if there are subjective states that *do not* have a physical correlate, than these states might forever be outside the realm of scientific examination. Examples might include mystical experiences, the feeling of subtle energies such as chi or prana, etc.

Science can certainly observe the brainwaves of people who claim to be experiencing such states, but that is different from directly studying the (potentially supernatural) *object* that could be engendering these states. Note how this is unlike studying a brain that is seeing a color red, where the object emitting the light can be directly observed.

None of this proves anything about the actual existence of the supernatural of course, it merely casts doubts on those who believe that science itself is an "all-seeing eye" with a truly universal method for obtaining knowledge.

I think these considerations answer your second question as well: Science has no choice but to assume that only naturalistic phenomena are at work because its method can see nothing else.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Actually collect taxes" would be good, but it's difficult. There is actually a clause in the Greek constitution preventing the taxing of shipping. Guess what the biggest industry in Greece is? Therefore Greece relies heavily on sales taxes, and even taxes on utility bills, which fall most heavily on the poor.

Some labor market reforms are called for, but severely cutting the pensions of people who are already retired, and often supporting multiple unemployed adult offspring, will only be counterproductive. </TEXT>

This is the first explanation of this move that I've seen that even halfway makes sense, and that manipulation is documented already in the case of Hanergy, where the CEO was borrowing from shady shell companies he controlled so he could buy more of his own stock every time the price threatened to go down. It wouldn't surprise me if this scam was a lot more widespread than has been reported.

<TEXT> Quantum physics shows that vacuum states are unstable, and while this is very interesting, it doesn't tell us why there is something rather than nothing, and if we feign that it does by defining "nothing" as vacuum states, or something like this, then we're guilty of a fallacy of equivocation.

Good point, and actually one I've made elsewhere, pointing out that Leonard Krauss commits this fallacy. To clear up what I meant, QM "nothing" is obviously not an *absolute* "nothing" with no laws, no physical objects, etc., but the fact that the state as close as you can get to "nothingness" within that system is unstable is suggestive of the theory that "nothingness" within *any* system, even a necessarily true one like formal logic, is also unstable. Not a proof of this assertion by any means, but suggestive none the less.

How can something be both necessarily true and contradictory, i.e. necessarily false? 

Logic is necessarily true, but it's not necessarily contradictory. It's only contradictory if we allow it to refer only to itself. 

Also, why should not having "a final referent to something that's not a logical statement" make a logical statement contradictory?

If logical statements refer only to themselves, eventually they will form a self-referential loop with all the self-reference paradoxes arising. Many attempts to axiomatize logic put limits on logical self-reference, but this requires a ultimate "ground" or referrent that is not itself a logical statement.

But if we re-frame consciousness as being primarily about choice...
Then we're just changing the subject.

I think there's a connection - [see my reply to OP here](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/32kp1i/the_connection_between_the_origin_of_matter_and/cqcxfj9). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm having a hard time conceiving of what you mean from a hard materialist position. Do you have anything else you could say about it?

It's hard to stay a "hard materialist" once you start contemplating these questions, in my opinion. Basically there needs to be some sort of free agent to make the primordial choice for what exists. It doesn't follow that this is a conventional "God" in any sense, however. It could be more like Schopenhauer's Will. 

I'm not familiar with these, what are they? I can also look it up myself of course but I'd love to hear your thoughts if you don't mind. 

The multiverse theory holds that this not the only Universe, there are other Universes out there, perhaps with their own laws of physics, etc.

As for the paradoxes of the actual infinite, you can start with Hilbert's Hotel or the fact that the infinite sum of the series 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 +.... actually equals negative 1 if we assume you can actually do "infinite sums" instead of treating them as approximations of very large but finite operations.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've recently realized that "why is there something rather than nothing?" is actually the *easy* question of fundamental ontogeny. While scientists and philosophers don't have an exact answer yet, it is obvious that somehow "nothingness" is unstable/impossible, as seen in Quantum Physics.

My own personal preference is for the theory is that formal logic is necessarily true, but also contradictory if it doesn't have a final referent to something that's not a logical statement (that is, a material object or something like it rather than an abstraction like a rule of logic.) This creates a need for a "necessary object."

So if what was called the Ultimate Question is really the easy question, then what's the hard question? It has to be why *this particular* something, rather than any of the other possibilities that might have served as adequate necessary objects.

Even if we live as part of a "multiverse," this doesn't solve the problem, as there can be only a finite number of universes, or else all the logical contradictions of Actual Infinities would arise.

What does any of this have to do with consciousness? Not too much, if we define consciousness in terms of awareness, qualia, etc. But if we re-frame consciousness as being primarily about *choice*, with those other qualities emerging later as consequences, then I think we're on to something. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the reply. I think my question is a little more philosophical. If there is no "master clock" for the Universe, then how can we say that the Universe as a whole has an age? Is 13.7 billion years just the age as it appears to us because of our "position" in spacetime, or is it somehow an absolute age? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am trying to make my way through Yanofsky's "Outer Limits of Reason" and I am on the section about the Incompleteness Theorems. I was following his argument pretty well until it got to the following:

He defines a predicate as a function that takes a number as an input and gives a logical value (true or false) as its output.

He then defines a fixed point of a predicate F(x) as a logical statement C such that F("C")=C, where "C" is the Gdel Number of C.

It appears that our predicate F(x) now outputs a logical *statement* instead of a logical *value*. Am I missing something here or is the author being sloppy in his explanation?

I agree with everything else you said, but wouldn't suppressing demand pressure yields *higher*?

<TEXT> Pick any number. Let's use 30:

2 is a factor of 30. But the next number after 30 that's a multiple of 2 is 32...

3 is a factor of 30 too. But the next number after 30 that's a multiple of 3 is 33...

...and so on.

See what happens? Poor old 31 is always left out. It can't ever share any factors with 30 (other than 1 of course.)

As for a formal proof, take any whole number "x" such that x1 and x is a factor of n. 

Since x is a factor of "n", then n/x is a whole number. 

But what about (n+1)? Well, for "n+1" to have "x" as a factor (n+1)/x would have to be a whole number. But distributing the division in the previous statement yields n/x+1/x. 

We already showed that n/x is a whole number, and 1/x is obviously not a whole number (since x1), and a whole number plus a non-whole number is never a whole number. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Negative numbers don't get equal treatment in mathematics. "-2" really doesn't get the respect as a unitary entity like "2." Instead, it's tradition to read it as "-1*2," so when you see -2^2, the tradition is to read it as -1( 2^2 ) = -1(4) = -4.

I personally consider writing -2^2 to be "bad grammar," since its meaning isn't clear as you've demonstrated by asking this question.

If we mean to say "the square of negative 2" we should write (-2)^2, and if we mean to say "the negative of the square of 2," we should write -( 2^2 ) </TEXT>

<TEXT>   Zaman is part of the Gulen movement, whose leading figure, Fethullah Gulen has been exiled from Turkey and accused of Deep State - or State within a state - operations.

Yep. Another major activity of the Gulen movement is running privatized "charter schools" in the US with your tax dollars. They operate over 100 schools in the US, often with minimally-trained teachers brought over on work visas from Turkey. 

Turkish politics overall is terrifying. There is not one "deep state" but several and they are currently at war. I remember one twitter quote from a few months back that said "unsubscribing from Turkish politics on mental health grounds." Anyone who looks into this subject will sympathize. It is one place in the world where pulp-fiction conspiracy theories actually stand a good chance of being not only true, but understatements of what's really going on. </TEXT>

Tarriffs impose an inherent limit on trade by raising the price of foreign goods as opposed to domestic goods. There are more marginal domestic producers in the market with a higher tariff than a lower one.

ut if you're trying to put more limits and regulations on trade that will actually be a bad thing.

The only regulatory limits to trade I support would be ones outlawing child labor or slave labor conditions, and egregious environmental pollution by the importing country.

<TEXT> Spengler was a pessimist like Schopenhauer who thought European civilization was ultimately doomed. He's part of the romantic Western tradition of the glorious loser who cannot prevail but fights on anyway because he is spiritually superior even if physically weaker. Once you're aware of this trope you see it everywhere in Western culture, from the religion of the Norse to Rorke's Drift to the Alamo. This attitude comes from the long history of Europe being less developed and less populous than the great Eastern Empires, and always in fear of being overwhelmed by them (especially the Mongols and the Ottomans.)

But like Schopenhauer who inspired a Nietzsche who was willing to "fight to win,"  Spengler has legions of fans in the fascist and far-right worlds who accept his diagnosis of history but not his prognosis. In my view Spengler has now become part of the "rhetoric of decline" that is used to justify right-wing views (our society is corrupt and decadent, it must become more disciplined because a big fight is combing with those other guys who don't look like us, etc.).

Somewhat of a myth, at least in Mexico. Africa that might be closer to the truth. There is (or was) enough community/state support in Mexico to counteract famines. 

the borders may be a sad necessity in terms of order but it doesn't follow that arbitrary trade restrictions need to be bundled with it. 

Not arbitrary. I do favor the gradual lowering of tariffs and immigration restrictions over time, but do it too fast and you risk a political backlash, economic panic, and collapse of the integration project.

If restricting speech and banning certain kinds of porn by people who claim control over pieces of land is considered bad, why is restricting/banning certain products good?

If you want to go with a porn analogy, right now we are allowing abusive porn where it is obvious that the women (workers) are being exploited/raped but we (investor class) get so much pleasure (profit) from it that we look the other way.

Full open borders would be like legalizing child porn and would be a moral and political disaster. </TEXT>

<TEXT> why are you hating on poor people who would spend decades longer working in subsistence farming and in hardcore sweatshops? 

No hate towards the sweatshop workers, but the subsistence farmers who are often forced off their land into sweatshops by free-trade deals that dump subsidized US agriculture products in their country might not agree that free trade helped them all that much.

In fact from purely utilitarian perspective it's better to lift billions from true poverty than to spare millions of special snowflakes some hardship.

I agree, but free trade doesn't always do that (Mexico is the country I had in mind above), and even when it does (such as China) if the disruption is such that it imperils economic integration through the rise of nationalism and ideological as opposed to pragmatic (and phased-out) protectionism then in the long run it is counter-productive.

Without lines of the map and people enforcing bans on shit, free trade would be a default state of the affairs.

Without those lines on a map, total chaos would be the state of world affairs. If you really want to see a race war, declare open borders tomorrow. I want to abolish those lines too, but it has to be done slowly. The past thirty years has seen this process proceed too fast, and it risks a big crash that will set humanity back. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The recent torture scandal has me wondering how much of our acceptance of torture comes from having a mainly Christian religious background in the US. At first glance, torture would seem to be very un-Christian, love your enemies and all that, but what else is Hell but eternal torture for "bad guys"? 

And if torture is something that God does, can a Christian say that it is categorically bad? And if a Christian meets someone (say a terrorist), that he is sure is going to hell, what's wrong with giving that terrorist a little foretaste of what he has coming to him, especially if you might also get some useful information?

Obviously this critique applies to all religions that believe in a hell, not just Christians. </TEXT>

You should read your own link: Schools are in compliance with Title IX if they meet *any* of the three prongs, whereas you are arguing as if they have to meet *all* of them.

Also an interesting tidbit in the article: Title IX has been used, though rarely, to increase the number of male sports or to give more funding to male sports as in the Kentucky case. 

No they don't. Further the NFL does not do that at all; you're referring to a particular source of revenue that is shared among them; it's not the case for ALL revenue.

Nor is it for college athletics under Title IX. The salaries of the football coaches alone often equal the entire budget for female sports. 

I'm not as equally productive as you. Paying me like I am doesn't prove that.

No, but nor are women's sports "paid" equally to men's. Only the *opportunities for participation* (proportionate to interest) must be funded equally. Like I said at some schools the football team alone is more than half the budget. If Title IX really meant an equal division of revenue, that would be illegal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> but why would the third world slow down its economic development so the feelings of the well off west are not upset?

They wouldn't have a choice. Growth in third-world economies could have been constrained by a tariff system geared to some level of continuing median wage growth in the rich world. Tariffs could have gradually been brought down to converge the wage lines so that both still sloped upwards instead of the current race to the bottom. 

Free trade agreements and open borders aren't a force of nature like electricity, they're a conscious policy decision. People are waking up to the reality that the impoverishment of middle America was not some kind of inevitable process. It was the direct (if perhaps unintended) result of government policies or lack thereof.

<TEXT> Equitably to them meaning either similar portions of either sex, or women guaranteed their interests met but men not provided that same guarantee, which means only thinking of one sex, which isn't equitable.

Women are not guaranteed anything under Title IX except that *if* they are interested and *if* male sports are also funded, then female sports must be funded equitably. 

Disallowing the same rate of expansion that females have by mandating women's interests be met first

There is nothing in Title IX that says women's needs must be met first, only that they must be met concomitantly. 

If you need special inducement-which by virtue of getting disproportionately more funding as I showed earlier-then you don't prove equal interest.

You did not show disproportionate funding, nor does Title IX require that. In fact quite the opposite.

Division I football is a huge revenue source

Right, and nothing in Title IX prevents head football coaches from being paid for a single game more than a lot of coaches of female sports will make in 10 years. Nothing in Title IX would prevent a school from taking all that money and using it to build a science lab either. All it says is that if that money is going to be put back into athletics, it must fund male and female sports equally if there is equal interest and ability.

I tell you what. Let's start a business, and as a rule no matter who works more or sells more, at the end of the day we'll split the profits 50/50. 

Sounds good to me. Lots of law firms operate like that - as does (gasp!) the NFL, the biggest and malest sports league of them all.

<TEXT>  I disagree that the law is a quota, because quotas mandate percents and Title IX does not, but that comes down to semantics. You don't have to fund *any* sports under Title IX, but if you do, you must fund them equitably. 

There has been a huge increase in female athletics at all levels since Title IX (with no concomitant decrease in male participation by the way) which makes me think that millions of girls enjoy and take athletics just as seriously as any boy.

Look at viewership, participation, and funding of athletics outside the education system. People by and large value male athletics more.

When athletics is part of the educational process, the number of *spectators* is irrelevant, just as the number of people who watch the Math Olympiad vs. a Shakespeare play says nothing about how math classes should or should not be funded compared to English classes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually yes it still can be. If your quota for hiring is "X% of employees must be female unless none apply", it's still a quota.

Not really. It would only be a quota if there were mixed teams, but with separate male and female leagues for everything but ping pong, you can't call that a quota. It just says you have to fund male and female teams equally.

Well if you cut a female team you're not longer in compliance

If you cut *just* a female team, you're no longer in compliance. But if you cut one of each you're still in compliance. Title IX just keeps athletic directors from *targeting* female teams for cuts because of the perception that women's sports aren't as "serious" as men's.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Looking at the numerous sports leagues that don't rely on funding enforced by Title IX suggests otherwise. Title IX's quota mechanisms masks male interest.

You have not shown a single quota in Title IX - because there aren't any. A school where girls just don't want to do sports could have zero female sports teams and still be in compliance with Title IX. That's not a quota system.

And when budget cuts happen in athletics departments, they can't cut female teams. 

I see nothing in the law that precludes cutting female teams for budgetary (as opposed to exclusionary) reasons. In the past female teams could be cut in tight budget times because "girls don't really need sports" or some such sexist rationale. Now there needs to be equitable treatment which I feel is a good thing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Responsive to interests and abilities" means that females at a school have to show an interest in athletics and ability to take part before Title IX kicks in, which is just what I have been saying. The huge increase in female participation in sports since Title IX shows that this interest is there. I would not say that males are vastly more interested in sports - watching sports, maybe, but not playing them. 

This prong of the test is satisfied when an institution is meeting the interests and abilities of its female students even where there are disproportionately fewer females than males participating in sports.

This means a school is in compliance with Title IX even if they have more men than women in sports as long as those women who are interested and able can participate. </TEXT>

That's not how Title IX works, it simply guarantees equal funding per student for male and female sports. It doesn't mean that the football team gets no money because there's no girls' football team.

synthetic phonics yield better results for both boys and girls than analytic(suggesting that those pushing for it merely wish for girls to outperform boys than optimizing education for children in general).

That's the first phonics-based conspiracy theory I've ever heard. I hope it is also the last.

<TEXT>  Of all crimes in the USA, armed bank robbery has the highest conviction rate... At 60%. Crime doesn't pay? For 40% of bank robbers, it does. 

Unless they take enough to set themselves up for life, they're going to have to keep robbing banks. Chances of pulling off just 5 robberies without getting caught at a 40% individual success rate is just 1%. Most bank robbers are desperate drug addicts or people with a debt to organized crime and are quickly caught. There are a few exceptions (like the North Hollywood shootings) where an organized gang still attempts a bank robbery Bonnie and Clyde style, but those days are mostly gone. In the era of swipe cards the amount of physical cash at banks isn't that high anymore. A lot of the more knowledgeable robbers go after the safe deposit boxes and try to break in after hours. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We probably don't agree much on politics I'm guessing, but you make some very good points about the counter-productivity of *means-tested* benefits, ones the article and the comments on the NYT site also touch on, namely:

1.) Child care + cost of car + commuting would cost more than many of these low-wage jobs pay. 

2.) "Job lock" syndrome where taking a low-paying job makes employers in your former industry far less likely to hire you, and also severely cuts down on your time to search for a job (witness the one guy who was fired for asking for a single day off to care for his dying mother.), and, if you get fired again, the fact that you had a low-wage job even for one day can reduce or even eliminate your unemployment benefits (I know this is true in Michigan.)

3.) "Abuse" of the welfare system by people making phony disability claims. The fact that SDI is welfare for white people is an open secret in Washington. There are counties in West Virgina and Kentucky where almost half of households get the majority of their income from SDI. You never hear the GOP screaming about cutting SDI, and for good reason, it's their most loyal voters who are on it. I know a woman who gets physically disgusted whenever someone so much as mentions Obama, and yet has been on SDI since 9/11 for "psychological trauma" from the event (she did work in New York, but not in the immediate vicinity of the Twin Towers). She uses her income in a so-far futile attempt to launch a singing career.

My solution would be to have a *universal* Basic Income and a *universal* health program and child care, this removing the economic dis-incentive to work that many of these men face, rather than just slashing these programs which will probably only increase the social destruction.

Fat chance of that happening in the current political environment, but one can dream. </TEXT>

Only those that already own homes and can trade on that equity, assuming that any gains they get from that aren't outweighed by the negative effects of financial repression on other forms of investment.

To dredge up an old analogy from the 2008 crash, if I owned some sick cows and the Fed announced that it would give me a healthy cow for every sick cow I handed over to them, that would be an equal-valued swap in your book, because I could also sell my sick cows to other institutions on the open market for a healthy cow, since those other institutions know they could turn their sick cows in to the Fed for a healthy one. </TEXT>

That's why I said "who knows what" quality. I have my suspicions but due to lack of transparency in these financial instruments we will probably never know.

 They traded an interest bearing dollar for an interest bearing reserve.

They traded a bond with a fixed payment structure for a demand deposit. These are not the same thing even if they both bear interest. You can't argue they have "equal value" when the "value" on one side of the transaction can be arbitrarily determined by the Fed's authority. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would disagree. Even if we accept the cosmos as eternal/infinite (which I don't, due to problems with Actual Infinities), there still remains the question as to why that state of affairs pertains instead of others.

If by "level IV" multiverse you mean ontological maximalism, the idea that all possible universes exist, that has numerous difficulties besides that of onotgeny.

The theory in this article has little or nothing to contribute to the philosophical debate on fundamental ontogeny, unfortunately. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  it makes a lot more sense for their to be consciousness first and a universe created from it

I agree, but...

instead of a universe spontaneously creating conscious beings through a series of evolutionary missteps.

Both of these propositions could be true, they don't necessarily conflict. The Universe could be the product of a primordial consciousness, and our own consciousnesses could indeed be simply the products of evolution.

The interesting question is - why would the primordial consciousness generate thought-forms in which material simulacrums of itself come into being? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you are right there is some ambiguity in what the sign means. It can mean "is not an identity," for example you could say a^b  b^a without raising any eyebrows, even though that statement is false when a = 2 and b = 4, for example.

On the other hand, a statement such as x  x + 2 is always true, and would seem to employ a stricter meaning of the  . I think you are on to something that the way to avoid this ambiguity is with logical quantifiers:

 a,b such that a^b  b^a is always true, but it is a much weaker statement. The original statement isn't just true for some values of a and b, it is true for almost all values of a and b.

x, xx+2, on the other hand, doesn't seem to lose any of the strength of the original statement.

I wonder if there is an extended logic system with a symbol for "almost all." Someone wandering by these parts will probably know. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm wondering if anyone else has noticed this. In lucid dreams I've always been tempted to touch or smell things and I'm always amazed at how "real" they seem, but unfortunately engaging more senses seems to make the dream dissolve.

Last night I had a good (if boring) lucid dream going where I was walking through a forest. I resisted the temptation to touch or smell anything and I noticed no dissolution setting in. Then, to experiment, I touched a birch tree and almost immediately woke up.

Has anyone else experienced this, and if so, have you found a way around it? I'd love to be able to do more than just look at stuff. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whichever one was assigned to the file to begin with. Let's assume I open iTunes and load song "foo" with ID number 12345. A line appears in iTunes called "foo," and behind the scenes, iTunes knows that when I click on that line, it opens file 12345. 

I could then re-name the file "foo2" and move it to a different folder. It doesn't matter, all that does is change where *I* see the file. To iTunes it's still 12345 and it's still stored in the same place on the disk. </TEXT>

"odd jobs" like this might not provide a full-time income, but I can see people pursuing stuff like this in the future in order to get the extra stuff they might want.

Putting it in a different folder would only change how it appears in the user interface, not where it actually is on the disk for iTunes to load. Same with changing the name of a file.

<TEXT> Is there such a concept as malemployment in economics as there is with malinvestment? That is, reducing UI might lead to a lower unemployment rate but a higher malemployment rate - people working in jobs that are not close to the economic optimum because they feel forced to take the first thing that comes along. 

Underemployment doesn't quite get at what I'm thinking about here because someone could be underemployed just because there are no jobs equal to his or her level of training, whereas malemployment would be more of a search problem for those jobs that do exist. The difference between the two would sort of be like the difference between a liquidity and a solvency problem at a bank. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If OBE's represent physically real phenomena, they should be relatively easy to test. Just put some random objects in a locked room and have someone who is out-of-body float over and take a look at them. Very simple and very scientific. Monroe claimed to have a technology that could reliably produce OBE's.

However, he seemed far more interested in cataloging scads of "other realms" and altered states which he numbered like Focus 1-100 and encounters with alien beings that were completely unverifiable. It is interesting stuff and might very well represent real *inner* experiences (that is, I don't think Monroe was just making stuff up - he was a wealthy man before starting his paranormal research), but he was not a proper scientist.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It does more than "stink," it will strangle the economy in the long run. Health care doesn't work as a market because prices are opaque, there is no time for price discovery anyway in an emergency, demand is almost completely inelastic, and there are no substitute goods (can't buy anything else if you're dead or incapacitated.) 

If Obamacare fails companies are going to push more healthcare costs on to their workers or drop plans altogether, and then you really will see perceived disposable income start to fall, since most will consider health insurance a necessity. Consumer demand will take a big hit and the economy will suffer further. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Believe me, people notice, they just don't say anything. I was in college before I knew that I didn't do this. My roommate was the kind of blunt person who would point out stuff like that, but afterwards when I asked other people they confirmed that I didn't make eye contact, they just never mentioned it, assuming I was shy or whatever, but honestly I'm not that shy it's just not something I ever thought to do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Low-status groups tend to be more aware of honor/respect issues than high-status ones, at least in my (modern) experience, just as someone with food insecurity is going to worry a lot more about the state of their fridge than someone who can just go to a restaurant if it breaks down. 

Obviously in feudal times things were different and no I am not suggesting that all blacks are low-status, but there is a correlation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not so sure it's arbitrary. At least with the specific example you refer to (xenia), the Greek religion believed gods would travel disguised as humans, rewarding good hosts and punishing bad ones. 

Of course this reflected/reinforced an underlying cultural attitude, but I don't think that just comes out of nowhere. Caring for a guest can be expensive, not to mention possibly dangerous. There must have been reasons why such customs arose despite these costs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I've thought of that - NOT that I am claiming to be a bodhisattva!

I always thought the compassion and non-attachment sides of Buddhism were in conflict with each other. Compassion seems to all be about caring for others, and non-attachment seems to be about withdrawing from the world, including others.

Maybe it's a creative tension though. I can see how compassion can get people past their self-attachment, but that makes compassion instrumental (i.e. "I am only trying to feel for you in order to ease my own suffering"), and I'm not really comfortable with that.

But I am only a Level 1 Laser Lotus so I'm sure your insight is far more advanced! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't necessarily believe in some of the "mystical" aspects of Buddhism (cosmic Buddhas, reincarnation, siddhis, etc.), but I've been influenced by Buddhist philosophy since I was a young teenager. I meditate and admire Buddhist leaders and speakers. 

However I've never called myself a Buddhist or even a "secular Buddhist" and recently I've realized my main "block" to the tradition is that I'm ok with suffering. If that's the price for loving the world and trying to build a self, I can accept that. To eliminate suffering by giving up that attachment to life seems like a bad deal to me.

Anyone else feel the same way? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think that actually goes on a lot in the US. It is so easy to destroy someone's character image or reputation, you don't need to be blatant about it and actually kill them (see: Assange, others.) JFK himself is a different story since he had real power to change things, but I doubt any witnesses to the assassination were themselves assassinated. In any large group of people there will be strange deaths.

Extreme Republicans got themselves worked up thinking Hillary Clinton was offing dozens of people to cover up her shady real estate deals by basically going through the list of everyone she knew. Guess what? Some of them had died in weird ways... that doesn't mean she killed them, it means she was a politician who knew a ton of people. </TEXT>

Also, I don't think it was ever proven that the more extreme actions of some Gladio groups were directed by NATO, or part of a coherent NATO strategy to undermine native communism in Western Europe. Most historians believe that a few of these groups decided to take matters into their own hands, or that Gladio recruited extreme rightists thinking they would follow orders, and they didn't. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would distinguish between a honeypot and something like Gladio. A honeypot is a government agent or false group that poses as an extremist leader or oganization to attract followers, then the whole group is rounded up, since of course the leader knows who everyone is, etc. 

Gladio was a covert stay-behind guerrilla force set up by NATO in preparation for a possible Soviet invasion. Unfortunately the kind of folks who are eager to join covert stay-behind guerrilla forces are not always the best-disciplined people on the planet, and several Gladio units started freelancing in organized crime and extreme right-wing activities, most notably in Italy and Turkey. </TEXT>

However people seem to have very mixed experiences with with these mushrooms, with a large number of dud and bad trips. Is there anyone who's had success with Amanitas that would like to offer some tips on how to make the experience a good one, or am I off on the wrong track choosing them for a first trip? </TEXT>

Wouldn't entropic gravity be a description of gravity on the quantum scale? That is, the theory is that there are more random quantum "opportunities" for a particle to move in the direction of the gravitational (pseudo)-force than in the opposite direction, or am I misunderstanding? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Problems with the Poisson Distribution - did I find an error in the textbook? Plus something surprising I discovered while researching the possible error that I can't explain... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-04-30 00:51:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The problem in question stated "a golfer has a long-term mean of 3.9 strokes per hole. What is the probability that he scores more than a 72 in an 18-hole game?"

The textbook said to solve this using Poisson and P(x4) for a mean of 3.9 - I don't think this is valid since the probability of getting more than four strokes on any given hole cannot be equated to *averaging* more than 4 strokes over the course of 18 holes, because of the Law of Large Numbers.

The problem is, when I solved P(x72) using a mean of 70.2 (3.9 times 18), it evaluated to a *greater* probability than what was in the textbook. I would have thought the Law of Large Numbers would imply a smaller probability.

Here are the relevant calculations. Can anyone tell me the error in my reasoning?

[P(x4| mean = 3.9) = 0.351635](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1-+%28sum+%283.9^x%29%28e^%28-3.9%29%29%2F%28x!%29+for+x+from+0+to+4%29)

[P(x72| mean= 70.2) = 0.384819](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1-+[sum+%2870.2^x%29%28e^%28-70.2%29%29%2F%28x!%29+for+x+from+0+to+72]) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would hesitate to call someone a fanatic unless they are imposing their beliefs on others. It is a recognized yogic practice in India, it wasn't invented by some nut on the Internet. Those pictures of Indian gods, especially Shiva and Kali, that you see with long tongues sticking out are supposedly references to the practice. 

Apparently though, there is a reasoning behind it that goes beyond the merely spiritual: According to what I've heard, in the throat cavity there are two sensitive regions that are very similar to what is found in the genitals. "Celibate" yogis would get their tongue up in there and basically get themselves off. Bizarrely enough, this was basically the plot of that 70's porno "Deep Throat" though a tongue wasn't the instrument used...

I do not know if any of this is true and I'm not about to cut my tongue tendon to find out, though if anyone on here has done such a practice I'd love to hear from them! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hmm, it might be a bit of a stretch but could we consider a function with a variable arity, perhaps one that varied according to a probability distribution? 

For example, I could imagine a random walk that always changes its x and y coordinates for each step of the walk, but only changes the z coordinate when a uniform random variable on [0,1] that is calculated at each step of the walk has a value above 0.5.

Could such a walk be considered to be moving in 2.5 dimensions? If so, what would the probability be that it returns to its starting point? We know that for two dimensions it will always return, but for 3 it only returns about 34% of the time. </TEXT>

My completely unscientific theory is there was some leftover "hippie" intonation that sort of merged with the "polite secretary" but was then pushed out by the "valley girl" and the "local news announcer" sometime in the mid-80's. I fondly wish for the return of that old female accent but I'm not too hopeful. In fact the default female public-speaking voice seems to have become even harsher and more aloof-sounding in recent years, especially on radio commercials. </TEXT>

It depends on how long this spawning process has been going on for. However, that doesn't apply to my original post because we are looking at a *ratio* of young to old universes, not the expected age of a randomly chosen universe. In the magic coin room, it's pretty clear that the ratio of "new" (1-year-old or less) coins to "old" coins will always be 1:1, and in the theory the ratio of young to old universes will always be very very large. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's part of Eternal Inflation Cosmology (EIC), which states that universes are constantly bubbling into existence as part of an Eternal Big Bang. You may have heard the saying "The Big Bang never ended." That is talking about EIC.

Depending on how you set the parameters for the formulas in this theory, the rate of universe production might appear to be increasing drastically every second. 

Imagine a room that, for every person of age "x," has a million people of age "x-1." The vast majority of people in that room will be very young.

What does that have to do with the Fermi Paradox? Well, imagine that room again. Take the number of people in that room who have had time to have children of their own. The vast majority of people with children will have had only one. There are a trillion 18-year olds for every 20-year old, after all. Replace "children" with "spawned an intelligent civilization," and you have the idea. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This one's my favorite:

Cosmologist Alan Guth proposed a multi-verse solution to the Fermi Paradox. In this theory, using the synchronous gauge probability distribution, young universes exceedingly outnumber older ones (by a factor of e1037 for every second of age). Therefore, averaged over all universes, universes with civilizations will almost always have just one, the first to develop.

Always thinking outside the box, that guy.  </TEXT>

I've read some criticism of Campbell that claimed he was proto-Fascist for reducing all of human culture to the struggle of the Hero, I think that's going too far, but it could be that he was too wedded to his idea of the Monomyth to see the dialectical possibility in the Hero breaking out of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Campbell was very erudite but he consistently missed the dialectical turn that always lay just beneath the surface of the Hero's Myth: The final monster for the Hero to slay is the constrictive, neurotic-repetitive form of the Monomyth itself in which he is imprisoned. 

I was certain when watching this series for the first time that this was the "twist" waiting at the end, but Campbell either never saw it or didn't think it was suitable for public consumption. He maybe hints at it in his discussion of the Native American "twins" myth cycle (where the twins witness their own story being written by the gods and try to reject it.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> You don't need Excel, this is one of the simpler spaces: It is called a multiset (or a multichoose) Sometimes it is called a "stars and bars" problem because of how it is diagrammed. A multiset shows up when you are choosing with replacement (allowing duplicates), but you don't care about the order in which the choices were made (which I assume is happening here since you used the word combination.)

You can turn a multiset into a regular combination by using the formula (n + r - 1) C (r). So, n = 21 and r = 10 for your example, so the size of the sample space would be 30 C 10 = 30,045,015

If you *do* care about order then the size is just n^r, so 21^10 which is around 16.7 trillion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Sunyata* is a term in Buddhism that is often translated as "emptiness" or "void." But as with most translations, it leaves something to be desired. *Sunyata* is like the emptiness of a cup, not the emptiness of "nothingness." The air or water inside the cup is not part of the cup itself, yet, without it, the cup would cease to be a cup. That is, the cup's very identity as a cup depends on some part of itself being not-cup. 

If we reflect on it, the same is true of ourselves. If you are not willing to change yourself, if you are not open to growth or new experiences, then you might as well be a pre-programmed computer or robot. Anyone who actually attains an eternal, unchanging self (*atta*), immediately ceases to be a self at all, and becomes an object with no more life in them than a rock has. 

Therefore our continuation as subjects is dependent on being open and receptive to non-self, to a willingness to incorporate that which is non-self into our identities (using discernment of course.)

Sometimes for these reasons you will see *sunyata* translated as "receptivity" instead of "emptiness." My feeling is it's somewhere in-between these two concepts.  </TEXT>

Reich was sort of a latter-day Jung with even more of a mystical bent, but the US government found him threatening enough that he was actually imprisoned and died in jail. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The actual doctrine is "anatta" which is usually (mis)-translated as "no-self." The Vedic concept of the "atta" is very different from the modern Western ideas about a "self." The atta was said to be eternal, unchanging, and identical with the Universal Principle (Brahman).

This is the "self" that the Buddha demolished philosophically, not the idea of a changing, growing, interconnected self.

If you think about it, an unchanging self isn't a subject at all, but an object. It is those who believe in an atta who have to ask "for whom is this done?" since there is no way to change the atta. Buddhism can answer - it is done out of compassion for our future selves as well as other beings. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Uh, I doubt that Hollywood has killed every character who ever said "God dammit." On the other hand, that punishing disbelief thing is very real though you're not the first to notice it. Part of it is just the convention of telling a good story - it's hard to make a good ghost story where the ghost turns out to be a hoax*, so of course the disbelievers in a horror movie will end up looking like idiots, but part of it is indeed playing to the desire the audience has for the paranormal/supernatural to indeed be real.

Critics have also long noted that supposedly "liberal" Hollywood movies also tend to punish people who have unconventional, kinky, underage or casual sex, especially in the horror genre. Say "God dammit" and you're probably safe, but be a teen having sex in a horror movie, you're screwed.

<TEXT> Names were things like Guy, and Girl, and no these weren't infants, though many were children or in their early teens, sometimes whole families.

That reminds me of something I once heard or read that there were certain schismatic Anabaptist groups that went out into the backwoods - if you were in one of these groups, you wouldn't get a "Christian" name until you were formally baptized into the church, and even some adults were not given that privilege (perhaps they had misbehaved or offended the church leaders), so they were just called "man" or something like that for their entire lives. 

On the other hand, an Anabaptist church probably wouldn't have an organ. Where was this church located? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I still think stuff like "Yea we should totaly do that" in my head when I'm thinking of something I should do ALONE.

Sort of embarrassing but I started doing that Freshman year of college when I was having a tough time socially. The "we" was me and one of my friends from HS who had gone to a different college. I don't know why I picked him probably because he was the most laid-back of my HS friends so he was a good imaginary companion. The weird thing is I talked to the real friend online but never told him I made an imaginary version of him to keep me company... I think that might have ended the real friendship pretty quick.

Anyway now years later I still say "we have to go shopping" to myself but I'm not thinking specifically of that friend anymore, it's just a generalized "we" made up of all the different aspects of myself. </TEXT>

Funny, that is now the hot trend in education again. Our Juniors and Seniors get three class credits for "job training" at the local fast food places and Wal-Mart. They can leave school at lunch. Needless to say this program is quite popular. Our district has even won awards for its "progressive" "apprenticeship" program. Of course it is all nonsense.

<TEXT> Seriously, their last emperor had an entire city slaughtered because their king would not give him a tree that would not even survive in Tenochtitlan's climate. They took the tree and it died.

Do you have more info about this incident? Seems like the king refused to give a symbolic tribute. It seems hard to believe that the Aztec emperor really cared about a single tree if there wasn't some symbolism attached to it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Calvinism   Predestination was always a very small minority belief within Christianity. Very few Christians were Calvinists even at its height and it has virtually died out today. Even churches that are still officially Calvinist (like Presbyterians and Dutch Reformed) do not promote the belief (sort of like modern Mormons and the whole Kolob thing...) </TEXT>

<TEXT> otherwise the human race would be full of good looking people by now. Obviously this person doesn't go to walmart very often.

Many of those people *were* reasonably good-looking in High School when they began their reproductive careers though...

All in all, saying that darwinian evolution worldview cannot align with a religious worldview demonstrates a lack of understanding of evolution and a lack of understanding of religion.

Maybe, but religion considers itself true, not just useful. There is a conflict on that level. Very few people follow a religion just because they think it is a socially convenient myth. I've only met one person like this in my entire life, and he was a very creepy and manipulative psychiatrist at a "Christian" hospital. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Social Darwinism used race as a virtual synonym for species, which it clearly is not - human races are 100% inter-fertile. 

Similarly, Social Darwinism argued for a political authority that would wield a kind of "artificial selection" that could replace and "hurry up" the process of natural selection, and used dog breeding as an example. 

The problem with this was dog breeding took hundreds of years on an animal with a much shorter generational cycle than humans, and actually increased the diversity of dogs - it did not lead to one breed of "Master Dog" the way many Social Darwinists wanted to (re)-create the "Master Race."

So not only was there moral horror from Scientific Darwinists against Social Darwinism, there was scientific outrage as well, since Social Darwinism was the crudest form of pseudoscience used to advance political ends. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You might want to look into the Catholic answer to this question. Catholic dogma today accepts evolution but suggests that during some point in the process of Evolution God gave the developing man and woman a soul, and this was Adam and Eve.

I personally don't believe in this, but it is an example of a belief that attempts to reconcile Darwin and the Bible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First, the theory of evolution makes soul-body dualism hard to conceive of, which in turn poses significant problems for explaining how the afterlife is supposed to work. 

I know this is picky, but orthodox Christians don't believe in soul-body dualism, they believe in a bodily resurrection on Earth, not body-less souls floating around heaven, despite the popular "folk Christian" idea that this what the afterlife is like. </TEXT>

Unions don't necessarily represent the pure working class. There are middle-class unions and even business-owner unions. In countries like Venezuela some unions are conservative and oppose the Socialist government. In Poland the trade union Solidarity was a big part in bringing down the Communist government.

This is part of why Communists such as Lenin are not necessarily big fans of unions. Lenin criticized "trade union consciousness" as just another form of bourgeois thinking. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And if you're looking to measure the value of open source software its contribution to GDP is just about the least exact measure.

I think that was his point, that economics needs to broaden its definition of value beyond GDP.

Someone who walks or bikes somewhere instead of drives is at least preserving value (if not creating it), by reserving the gasoline for someone who may have no choice but to drive (a disabled person, for example.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Abraham Lincoln was a white supremacist...

That's oversimplified. As a younger man he did think that the "characters" of the races were too different from one another for them to live together in peace, and the best solution was for the slaves to be freed and emigrate to a climate more suited to their culture, like the Caribbean. I think he mentioned Haiti as an example of a successful black Republic being formed in that region.

Also, that was the Lincoln of 1845. The Lincoln of 1865 had come to see the long view of history, and supported not only emancipation but voting rights and the right to hold public office for blacks who owned property or who had served in the military - which is what got him shot by Booth.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If I remember correctly, Bush campaigned on letting younger people opt out of the system altogether, and letting everyone, even those already retired, put their money in 401(k)-style accounts that they could choose to place with mutual fund companies like Fidelity. This is why Gore kept hounding him on the "lockbox" that he was so mocked for. As for the actual bill that got introduced, I don't know if it was that radical in its final version.

At least as it has been reported in the media, Ryan's plan involves replacing Medicare with $6000 vouchers (the per-person cap) with which people could buy private insurance. The government would still subsidize insurance for the elderly, but would no longer guarantee it. Again, this would be phased in, with people over 55 allowed to stay in "traditional" Medicare. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I combined my responses to your two messages here. In case I got too wordy for you I put the **TL;DR** main points of my argument in bold.

.


Holding a belief, just because famous people held, is in general poor form. It is no defense for that belief.

As a non-expert, I am unfortunately reliant on the opinions of these "famous people." Alas, these vary greatly, from transcendentalists like Gdel to straight materialists like Krauss, and every shade in between, so I attempt to find among their views those that seem the most consistent, and which accord most closely with my own phenomenological experience. I admit the possibility that I have failed in this task.

.

 don't know any experts (I.e people who study consciousness and have a grasp of quantum mechanics... Note these are very few) that hold your view. 

Who are some people you know whom you feel have a grasp of both cogsci and QM? I would be interested to read the opinions of these dual experts. Penrose I think comes closest, but you're obviously not a fan.

You are quite right that the debate has mainly been a few adventuresome QM experts saying their field has implications for consciousness, and neuroscientists disagreeing with them (although *philosophers of mind* are sometimes a different story, and are occasionally more receptive to the views of these physicists.)

.


A notorious example is David Bohm and his holonomic brain theory. 

I am not a fan of Bohm. I don't even think his ideas are even coherent, let alone correct.  That the lenses in our eyes somehow keep us from seeing the holographic universe? It sounds like the ravings of a schizophrenic...

.

 In general, there is nothing wrong with being a dualist

Ugh, I disagree. Trying to formulate one fundamental ontology for existence is difficult enough, let alone two. I am not a dualist, at least not in the "two original substances, matter and mind" sense of the word. I don't think you can be a dualist without ultimately falling into the absurdities of Descartes and/or Leibniz. I do think though that a non-formal element is entailed by the existence of the physical world (see below.)

.

How would quantum computing be anti-formalist? How do you think we study quantum computing? It is an extremely formal field.


**I will address QM in general here, as I get to its computing aspect below: QM is extremely formal, perhaps the most formal theory ever devised, but precisely in being so it "heightens the contradictions" of formalism. It resorts to such things as negative probabilities, objects that are both waves and particles at the same time, and, as I learned from your article link, probabilities that don't add up to 1 and that violate the sure-thing principle.**

**This sort of thing, to me, points to the fact that we are trying to study a non-formal aspect of reality with formalist tools, and, however successful the mathematics has been, at root logical incoherence is the result. I will perhaps further irritate you and name-drop the ultimate famous person here and say the Einstein had similar criticisms of the ultimate logical validity of QM.**

.


To me it sounds that by non-formalist, you mean non-physicalist.

Not exactly. My philosophy is closer to people like Tarski and Gdel who wrote on the limitations of formal logic. I would consider them to be anti-Formalists under my definition, though usually this term is not applied to them by historians of philosophy (they reserve it for woolier figures like William James...). 

[And before you say Gdel wasn't a physicalist, I would disagree. To me Platonists are the ultimate physicalists. I won't elaborate more here as we'd go down a very long side-path.]

.


I would also distinguish between a *non*-formalist (someone like Meillassoux who thinks the Universe is a "hyper-chaos" that only *appears* sensible) and an anti-formalist (someone like me who thinks that there is more to the Universe than formal processes.) 

.


For me the physical universe is very real, it is not just the dream of a butterfly or some such nonsense, but, by the very virtue of its being real, it contains a non-formal, though not necessarily non-physical, element, that is, something that can *never be explained* by a formal system. Note that this does not mean the element is mystical or supernatural in any way. 

.


**To me it is no coincidence that QM and consciousness both seem to produce a "decoherence" of logical discourse - it is very difficult to talk about either of them using ordinary logical principles, a sign that they both belong to the non-formal aspect of reality. Do they share any connection beyond a connection of type? My intuition is that they do - and that the vast computing power promised by Quantum Computing and the vast apprehensive ability possessed by consciousness are signs of this link.**

.


Without boring you with an entire manifesto, my "anti-Formalist" view is that formal systems cannot provide a complete description of reality, that logic always needs to refer to a non-logical "ground" in order to avoid contradiction, and therefore there is always a gap between a formal description of reality and the Real itself, and that consciousness lives, at least in part, in this gap.

Where do I get these weird ideas? Well, I see an unnamed but important line of thought in philosophy passing from Hegel to the post-Incompleteness generation of mathematicians, and then through figures like Heidegger and Lacan to modern thinkers such as Badiou (though I don't share the latter's politics.) I've come to think of this as the "anti-Formalist" line of thought, though that's my own term for it, nothing official. If you are not familiar with any of these writers, they hold that each entity contains a gap, a "not-all" within itself that not only allows for but *insists* that something radically "Other" must emerge from within.

.


So yes, I've outed myself as one of those damn Continental-philosophy fanboys, the kind of dupe who you probably think would have been fooled by the Sokal Hoax had I not been in grade school at the time. Do with me as you will!

.


Their ideas on consciousness were very naive and motivated not by a psychological problem but by the physics/philosophy problem of measurement in quantum mechanics. 

I am interested on your views on the measurement problem. Do you think it can be resolved (or dissolved as Wittgenstein would say) without a reference to consciousness, either on a human or a cosmic level? If so, how? [You might be interested in this article](http://www.bigquestionsonline.com/print/138). It is close to my views though I wouldn't use the term "God" as it's too historically freighted.

.


The reason I would like to see this is because I'd've never seen an intelligent defense of quantum mysticism and I would really like to see one. 

You won't get one from me - I'm not a quantum mystic, at least if by that you mean the belief that, say, entanglement means people can have psychic powers, or things of that sort. I am open-minded towards the paranormal, though not a believer. I like to say I don't want to be so open-minded that my brain falls out!

<TEXT> I was just pointing out that many famous scientists have believed in or theorized about a connection between *biology* and QM, and if we accept that consciousness is a biological process at least on some level, then there may indeed be a QM component to consciousness, just as there is in other biological systems.

You might think the links between quantum effects and cell biology are "nothing special," but until recently biology was thought to be explainable in wholly classical terms, except by some visionaries like Schrdinger,  and now we know that's not true. 

You are right that Gdel was a Platonist, and also right he didn't think that the link between his Theorems and consciousness was related to QM, but you were rubbishing that idea as well, so I thought I'd admit where I stand on that issue as well.

Fundamentally I am an "anti-Formalist" when it comes to consciousness, meaning I think that somehow (whether through QM or Platonic Forms, or some other mechanism), consciousness exists at least in part outside the formal, "billiard-ball" world of classical physics.

Oh, and the fact is I have read what you've read, we just disagree. I don't claim to be an expert, but when the experts disagree, the layman is allowed his opinion.

<TEXT> Well, to Penrose you would also have to add the even more formidable name of Schrdinger, who theorized on this issue in his "What is Life?" 

As for Gdel I guess this will get me in an even deeper hole with you, but I do indeed think there is a link between the Incompleteness Theorems (there's more than one) and consciousness as well. Of course, Gdel himself believed this, but then, Gdel wasn't a brain scientist and he went crazy, etc. etc. (You can tell I've had this argument before.)

Anyway. I'm not saying microtubules are what links QM effects to consciousness, it could be some other mechanism. Recently some solid links between QM and biology have been found, for example [in the navigational systems of birds](http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.3725). It's not consciousness - yet - but it does show a link between the biological and quantum worlds. 

I am "agnostic" on this link in a strictly scientific-method sense, but in a broader philosophical context, due to what I see as weaknesses in traditional naturalism, yet as someone unwilling to accept dualism or a purely "mystical" explanation for consciousness, the link to quantum processes seems suggestive, though not conclusive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have not read much technical literature and I realize popular articles on the subject can be sensationalistic or misinformed. However I still think there **might** be a connection between quantum states and consciousness, and there are some well-informed experts (Penrose, for example) who believe so as well. Do I have definite proof? No - that's why I used the word "believe" instead of "know" or "can prove."

<TEXT> Haha, very civil reply. Anyway, ignoring your nastiness, my hypothesis is that the ability to process information and yet be in observation of the same process simultaneously, which seems to be an ability of human consciousness, might also be a characteristic of these sorts of computers. If quantum computers are possible, being able to calculate in super-position states might grant them this ability. </TEXT>

According to another, more cool legend, the follower was killed not because he made the discovery but because he *talked about it publicly*, revealing esoteric knowledge that was only meant for the Pythagorean elite.

In addition to being mathematicians, the Pythagoreans were also a religious cult. Imagine a cross between the MIT Pure Math faculty and Scientology. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Chalmers sees consciousness as a Cartesian theater when he talks about consciousness is "presented" to him, as if he were a member of the audience watching his senses take the stage. He questions why processes are "accompanied" by experience, as if experience is an extra effort of theatricality for his enjoyment.

But isn't this exactly the case? That the conscious perception of a color is somehow different from say, how a computer would analyze visual wavelengths seems undeniable. Do you believe that a computer sees the color blue just as you do, that it has the same experience? I don't.

This element of theatricality, of presentation, is *precisely* the hard problem. Even if it is an illusion, it seems that this illusion could not arise except from a *prior ground of theatricality* that already exists!

Where I might differ from the Clarmers position is I think computers, probably quantum computers, will someday begin to have these presentations. That will be quite the interesting day. </TEXT>

Had Israel been established and expanded in the 19th Century, like the US, and killed, ghettoized or expelled most of the Arabs, as the US did with the Indians, there would be no big debate.

That being said, the rich Arab oil states could easily pay to resettle the Palestinians - say in the Hejaz - but have chosen not to as that would be "giving in" to Israel . The Palestinians I have a lot of sympathy for. Both Israel and their Arab adversaries, though, not so much. </TEXT>

When the French and Swiss governments decided to express displeasure with Nixon's inflationary policy and redeem all their notes for gold, Nixon and the Fed said "screw you" and closed the international gold window as well. 

It had nothing to do with economic growth and insufficient amounts of gold being dug up.

What about the view that Nirvana and Samsara are just different attitudes or reactions towards the same reality? Hippie talk and not real Buddhism, some say. I'm not so sure.

In fact, Nirvana is absolute bliss, and is not like nothingness or blackness at all. 

But bliss is still a sensation, and Nirvana is supposed to be super-sensate. Not trying to split hairs but I think it's an important distinction.

<TEXT> There are engravings from the Renaissance that show the Great Pyramid about half-buried in a sand-drift. No, nothing in orthodox Christianity or Islam says that biblical figures built the pyramids, but in demotic folk religion this belief was common. You will hear it from taxi drivers in Egypt to this day. 

As for wanting to make a bigger structure, as I said, it was thought that the pyramids were the work of legendary figures so I doubt anyone thought it was possible. The Ptolemaic Dynasty in Egypt did brag that the Great Lighthouse was a successor to the pyramids. At 450 feet tall it was almost as tall as the Great Pyramid though of course its volume was far less. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know that for some of the time period in question a good deal of the pyramids were obscured in sand drifts. 

However, it's wrong to suggest that people in previous times were not impressed by the pyramids. There were a good deal of legends about them, such as that they were built by biblical figures (usually Aaron, Moses or Mohammed), and that they could cure ailments. 

As the pyramids were seen as the creations of legendary figures, not ordinary men, their vast size was somewhat taken for granted. In that sense people in those times might have been less impressed than modern people as to the immensity of the achievement. </TEXT>

Then there's church-funded schools which also have powerful constituencies that are often indifferent to parent needs. 

In my experience public schools are often over-sensitive to parent demands because of a fear of lawsuits or a nasty story on the local news. </TEXT>

I am not sure if chakras are "real" or not in a spiritual sense but I have been disappointed by these experiences in the long run - they seem to be leading to something great then it just fades. 

On the other hand some other mediators report quite impressive things that happen after the whole chakra/kundalini experience. I guess what I'm saying is don't get your hopes too high just yet but don't dismiss it either. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The "absolutist relativism" that is so often attributed to Postmodernists can be easily destroyed as a coherent concept by any halfway with-it college freshman, and already has been many times of course.

However, you'd be hard-pressed to find an actual "Postmodern" philosopher who actually held or holds such an extreme position, it's more of a straw-man position ascribed to these philosophers by their opponents. 

Part of the problem is there was never a coherent philosophical school called "Postmodernism," no Manifesto with bullet points nailing down specific beliefs, or anything like that, because after all, what could be more anti-Postmodern than a Manifesto? 

So therefore it's hard to point to any ideas that are specifically "Postmodern" in nature. It is/was more of a mood of epistemological skepticism and a style of argumentation than a defined set of positions.

Of course there is also Hess's own statement (under a pseudonym after landing) that he was a friend of the [Duke of Hamilton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Douglas-Hamilton,_14th_Duke_of_Hamilton#World_War_II.2C_the_Hess_Affair.2C_and_after), and later on that the purpose of his flight was to negotiate a secret peace treaty. Hitler certainly believed that's what Hess was up to and ordered him shot on sight if he returned to Germany (although he may have changed his mind in the highly unlikely even that he returned with a treaty in hand!) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, in fact he wanted an alliance with Britain against the US, where he thought the Aryan blood had been too corrupted by Jews, "Negroes," and other inferior types. And also he thought that two "Continental" powers would always be antagonistic, whereas a "Continental" and a "Maritime" power could work together. He saw both Germany and the US as continental but the British Empire as Maritime. All this and more bonkers geopolitics can be found in [Hitler's second book](http://www.amazon.com/Hitlers-Second-Book-Unpublished-Sequel/dp/1929631618/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1342462243 sr=8-1 keywords=hitler%27s+second+book) as well as some passages in the original Mein Kampf.

Some people in Britain, by the way, thought about an alliance with Hitler. It wasn't just a one-sided love affair. How many people in Britain and how much influence they had in the country is a matter of debate, but Rudolf Hess was almost certainly trying to contact these elements when he flew to the UK in 1941. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually, Paulides is a bigfoot investigator, and probably first heard about these cases while interviewing park rangers about bigfoot. He tries hard to keep the areas of his life separate because he doesn't want to be the "crazy bigfoot guy" who also does missing-persons cases, but his Amazon page gives him away.

Still, the pattern of cases is no myth and they can be verified in local newspapers and police reports. They could use an advocate with better credibility than Paulides. He is ex-law enforcement but whether it's fair or not, his involvement with bigfoot will make many people immediately discount his other work which is unfortunate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A hundred years ago, a large percentage of women were homemakers.

"homemaking" was a hard job and often included much child care and farmwork. Yes, people still have kids today, but caring for nine or ten as compared to one or two is quite different. Today hardly anyone cares for nine or ten kids without it being an employed position (teacher, child care center worker, etc.) I would not count the housewives of the 19th century as being "unemployed" in the modern sense. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sort of correct. The tractor and mechanical thresher did force millions of farm workers off the land. They moved to the cities though and found industrial work in the factories which were booming, but when the 1930's depression hit they could not just "go back to the farms" like city-dwellers had done in previous downturns. That's when the starvation and homelessness started.

It's interesting to read about the Great Depression in France where smallholdings, gov't policy and social customs limited farm automation. The Depression was less severe in France (though still bad) because many laid-off workers simply went back to the family farm. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I assume we're not planning on digging mass graves

Don't assume so quickly. I've been reading Ben Franklin's accounts of his trips to England. He had conversations with the upper class where they openly discussed how to start a big war to get rid of the excess population. Eventually they decided (economically) forced emigration to North America and later (legally) forced emigration to Australia were better options, but they considered mass graves. I'm not so sure things are too different today. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was about a woman who had kept a dead Christmas tree in her house since 1993, decorations and all, and documented its decomposition over time. She lost friends over the "creepiness" of the tree, but wouldn't give it up. According to what I overheard, she even got the tree declared an "artistic landmark" by "the city" and exempted from laws which would have made her throw it out. (not sure which city, but it could be NYC or Philly.) Supposedly it aired on PBS - though maybe only locally.

Has anyone heard of this documentary, and if so, is it available online? I tried asking r/documentaries. Two people had seen it, one thought he remembered the title as "Mad City Tannenbaum," but I couldn't find any reference to that title online. The other could not remember the title.

Further details: The two people talking knew this woman personally, and she seemed to have some mental problems but also some political influence. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why did they keep making payments on their car? It's not like the repo man was going to come knocking on their door.

If you stop making car payments, the lender gives your license plate number to the police. Especially with the increasing numbers of police departments with automatic plate-scanners mounted on their cruisers, you will probably be found.

Edit: Oh, and I forgot, it is also possible that you will be charged with stealing the car. In your car loan it says if you can't make the payments you must immediately surrender the vehicle. Technically, the bank owns the car until you make the last payment. Trust me, stopping car payments is not a good idea. Better to sell the car and get something cheaper if possible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There were really two economies in colonial America, one in the South and in Latin America that was more like the old world with huge landholdings and slavery/serfdom. The other was in the North and was really anomalous in world history at least since the early Roman expansion in that ordinary people could and did become landholders, often large landholders.

more the government than the marketplace, but yes. The other main "method of attack" on this economic dislocation was to create "perceived needs" for goods that people "didn't know they wanted." This is more of a marketplace function.

What happens in 100 years if only 10 percent of the planet needs to be employed to adequately fill the market's labor uses?

<TEXT> I ask this because the other day I walked into a restaurant with my girlfriend. The maitre d' station was unmanned and beyond it was just a stairway leading down underground. We knew the place was open because I could hear rock music and people talking plus normal restaurant sounds (plates, glasses, etc.) coming from downstairs. 

But... there was creepy clown stuff everywhere on the walls in the entranceway and leading down the stairwell. I could also see the edge of a jukebox downstairs and this frightened me too for some reason. I am not afraid of clowns in the least and neither is the gf but something told us to get the hell out of there and we did. 

We had to walk blocks and blocks to find another restaurant and now I feel somewhat embarrassed at being such a chicken and running away from a restaurant because of clown stuff on the walls. By the menu outside it looked like they had good food and beer too. 

On the other hand, we might have just barely avoided being chopped to pieces by killer clowns. It got me to thinking, who here has had the strong instinct to leave a place for no specific reason but ignored that instinct? What happened then (good or bad)?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've always had a soft spot for the Polynesian theory but I must admit most of the recent evidence is against it.

I still think there's a Polynesian influence on Japanese architecture - perhaps spread by merchants which became a prestige form - and on the pronunciation if not the underlying grammar and root syllables of the language. I can't prove any of this, it's just a semi-educated hunch. I used to think Japanese was most likely an Altaic-Polynesian trade creole but this seems increasingly unlikely, especially with the discovery of proto-Japanese forms in Korea. </TEXT>

<TEXT> would be a strong indication that a people migrated in from that neighbor.

*Some* people, yes, but not necessarily a large number that would change the genetic character of a population. Material cultures have been known to spread in pre-history without corresponding changes in the physical characteristics of a population. Interestingly, there are sometimes small numbers of distinct "foreigner" burials - probably remains of the merchants or outcasts who spread the material culture. I'm not sure if this is the case in Japan or not. I know this phenomenon is documented in prehistoric Britain and elsewhere in Europe.

The culture you're thinking of is the Jomon. Studies I've seen have said that modern Japanese ancestors are anywhere from 10-40% Jomon, with the remainder being Korean in origin. </TEXT>

A common misconception. The spread of a material culture does not always imply the spread of large numbers of immigrant peoples. The same rice culture spread from China to Korea, and the Chinese and Koreans are genetically distinct.

There is a strong argument to be made that the Japanese and Koreans are closely related, but not based on the sort of evidence you site.  </TEXT>

Personally I think AP is a kind of lucid dream but one where the dreamworld is a replication of the room where you went to sleep and it is not easy to change which is a different sort of experience from a normal lucid dream. I had one such lucid dream in college where I wandered around my dorm, then "fell" through a wall and ended up on the street outside.

<TEXT> I've always thought that the utilitarian and contractualist ethical schools can be reconciled, at least in part, by adopting the [geometric mean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean) rather than the better-known [arithmetic mean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean) as the measure of aggregate utility. 

That way, a single person in total privation (like the girl in the Le Guin story who must be tortured in order to provide Utopia for everyone else) would set the measure back to zero. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There was a study I read about (can't remember where), which measured the IQs of chess grandmasters, and the mean IQ was actually subnormal to a statistically significant degree. Not terribly so, it was somewhere in the mid 90's, but it put paid to the myth of the chess "genius." 

Apparently these grandmasters had spent so much time focusing on such a narrow skill (often from a very early age), that their wider reasoning skills had never developed properly. 

Could at least partially explain all that Bobby Fisher conspiracy theory madness. Chess doesn't drive one mad directly, it merely makes shabby intellects believe that they are geniuses in fields they know nothing about. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In theory. I'll guess that doesn't actually happen very often. As school discipline is opaque by law (at least in the US, don't know about Canada for sure), the public can't know how this policy is actually being implemented. This is to push up graduation rates, it happens in the US all the time. In many districts the lowest grade you can get for a mark is a 50 even if you never attend class once. That way, you can still "make up" the grade and get to passing by the end of the year. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, 2000 calories per day is "starving" you. Maybe if you're an athlete. Not if you're a lazy fatass who sits in a hospital bed all day.

Depending on how fat these people are, 2000/day might be a pretty significant calorie deficit even if they are just sitting in bed. Larger mass bodies do take more calories just to keep everything "ticking over." This can be an advantage to weight loss, actually, the fat works in your favor in the beginning, but if a person feels forced into it I can easily see it setting off a panic response (which is why "fat camps" for kids rarely work...) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have heard this theory, probably from the same TV show as the OP. The argument made by the documentary was that the symptoms of the Aztec plague did not match any known European disease. It's quite possible in my mind that, after being weakened by European diseases, native diseases that the Aztecs previously resisted spread and ended up finishing them off. 

However, the documentary focused solely on the Aztecs and not the wider downfall of the native civilizations in the new world. It is a known fact that a lot of them succumbed to smallpox and this is attested to by skeletal and DNA evidence. It was in part because this evidence was supposedly lacking with the Aztecs that the documentary made the argument that it did. They even had, if I remember correctly, some people on who claimed this disease spread back to Europe and was responsible for some of the later outbreaks of "plague" where the symptoms were quite different from those of the Black Death. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For the most part, we have government doing important stuff. 

Not so much anymore. So many important functions have been privatized, at this point I think you can legitimately increase the scope of government without impinging on things that the private sector does better. Study after study, for instance, have shown that private "charter" schools perform worse than traditional public schools, despite the fact that charter schools can pick and choose their students. And of course the privatization of important security and military functions has been widely documented. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I second that recommendation. It's quite interesting how he maps out the process by which the ultra-religious society of the Middle Ages collapsed *from within*, not because of papal corruption or the rise of science as a rival doctrine per se, but more because the natural development of its own dogma led to unbearable contradictions and conflicts.

Seeing science as a natural offshoot of religion (study God by studying His creation), that eventually turned against its ideological "parent" is quite revealing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's any object whose existence depends on the existence of another object. For example, a physical body's existence is conditioned upon the existence of the atmosphere, the sun, etc. Since there is always change in the Universe, all conditioned objects are linked together and are thus always changing and ceasing their present form without end.

An unconditioned object, by contrast, is a metaphysically necessary object. It *must* exist, and stands outside the chain of dependence and change. Various philosophical traditions have differing views on this object. Of course in the Christian tradition it is God, the Buddhists call it Nirvana, etc. Some philosophies deny that any such object exists. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep, I came here to say this. But it goes back further, to the long Tokugawa peace, when the warriors of the previous age were romanticized. Ironically, when violence came back to Japan in the Bakumatsu and the Boshin War, a lot of the combat actually took on the highly stylized "chivalric" character that the combatants *imagined* was how the Samurai fought pre-1600.

Legend became reality, and that continued right up through how the Japanese fought in WWII (courageously, but recklessly.) To take one example, Japanese fighter pilots were known to hold *live duels* with each other in their planes, sometimes even shooting each other down. This was tolerated by commanders as part of the "warrior spirit." Combat discipline was a huge problem in the Japanese Army in the pacific theater. Troops would charge when ordered not to, and would refuse to retreat to more defensible positions when ordered to do so. One cannot imagine Ieyasu or any other actual samurai-era commander condoning such foolishness.

It is interesting to read the accounts of actual samurai who fought before the Tokugawa period. There are lots of passages like "we encountered the enemy, but they outnumbered us, so we ran away," and "we were paid off so we switched sides," not so much emphasis on suicidal charges and undying devotion to the Daimyo or the like (though these things did happen occasionally - every legend has a kernel of truth.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> They are products of the modern media culture where everything has to be over-the-top and confrontational. Bertrand Russell they are not. However, I am not too worked up over this. The Religious Right have had their way bullying and silencing the rest of us for some time now, and if they're now getting fed a bit of their own medicine, well, turnabout is fair play. Facebook is not trivial - it's a major social forum these days, and if religious bigotry and ignorance goes unchallenged there,  that is a big deal.

However, that doesn't make Krauss someone who's actually had insights into fundamental ontology. He obviously hasn't, and to claim otherwise unfortunately weakens his political arguments, which I do by and large agree with. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agreed. Part of the problem is that "white" has always been defined negatively, that is, a "white" person was just someone who didn't fit into one of the more identifiable racial or ethnic groups. Might as well just call us "blank" people.

Another problem is that the "white" population in the US came from so many different European cultures that they really don't have that much of a common cultural background at all. Just like the Indian in the video who couldn't explain his culture as anything more than "dancing around a totem pole and stuff," what is "white" culture to the average American today, that is, culture that only "white" people can participate in and enjoy? NASCAR and Country Music? Hardly worth defending against some other culture or subculture that may be more appealing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Google "Nazi Cultural Revolution." I think I'm remembering a proper book when it was just a review I read of "Werewolf!" plus some chat-board discussions.  

They're interesting nonetheless and would certainly make a great novel should someone choose to write one. Heck, I'll get us started:

Basically, Goebbels and the other surviving Nazis (with an ailing and increasingly demented Hitler in tow) carry out the "Alpine Redoubt" plan they were considering in 1945, and manage to spark a war between the US and the Soviets using false-flag attacks with the connivance of Patton and Churchill (both of whom considered an immediate attack on the Soviets in real life.) While the two former allies pummel each other, the Nazi Party is reconstructed along ultra-radical lines in rural Bavaria and Austria, paralleling Mao's Long March. The Party is toughened up, and (like Mao's forces), realizes that the total collapse of civilization is not enough to stop a determined group of radicals from seizing power. In fact, it rather helps things along.

Shadowy bankers from Switzerland cross the border into Nazi-held territory with gold and other resources for re-armament. Remnants of the Italian, Vichy French, and other fascists also make their way across the high passes of the Alps and join up with the Waffen SS. Ironically, the SS is now "multicultural" (this was happening to some degree in real life before the end of the war - they even had a Muslim battalion!). Some "adjustment" of racial views take place - success in battle is now evidence enough that you must have "Aryan" ancestry somewhere (Jews still need not apply, of course.)

In the chaos of the US-Soviet war, the Nazis manage to re-take a lot of their former territory and become a "Third Force" that neither the US or the Russians want to piss off for fear of putting the Nazis in the opposing camp. When peace finally arrives in late 1947 (Truman has threatened to nuke Moscow with his new long-range bombers), the Nazi regime is re-entrenched and there is no trust left among the former allies to take it down. Cynical politicians on both sides also see the advantage of a Central European "buffer state" between the American and Soviet Empires to keep border tensions down. The Holocaust is known about, but it is lost in the sea of the mass slaughter of an expanded and elongated World War II.

Hitler was already quite sick in 1945 and dies by 1950, succeeded by a triumvirate of Goering (who is also sickly and morbidly obese by this point), Bormann and Goebbels. Himmler defected to Sweden when all seemed lost in 1945 (his actual plan in real life) and is now a Trotsky-like figure. By the 1960's, the Reich has become a bizarre cross of Switzerland and North Korea, committed to neutrality but also ruled by a totalitarian political party which is armed to the teeth with some of the most advanced weaponry in the world.

By this point, Goebbels, always the master propagandist and politician, has pushed aside Bormann. Goering died in 1955, a 500-lb. monster, surrounded by harem girls and plundered art. Goebbels was always on the left-wing of the Party and wants to revive the "Socialist" in National Socialism. However, he faces strong opposition from conservative Christians and business interests who are now doing a booming trade with both the US and Soviet spheres. 

However, Goebbels has a potent weapon: A new generation of "Aryans," raised by the Hitler Youth and the "Lebensborn" movement. These cadres, now come of age, assail the conservatives and try to revive the dream of world conquest and the Master Race. They protest at Universities and party conventions, carrying their "little black books" - abridged copies of *Mein Kampf* of course. They occupy Albert Speer's grand buildings in Berlin and demand the downfall of the "bourgeois  Junkers" and the "foreign elements" within the Waffen SS. The rest of the world grows nervous that World War III is about to begin...

take it from there!

<TEXT> Interesting question. I may take heat for this, but there are a lot of similarities between Hitler's expansion towards the East and the genocide of the Native Americans in the US. Indeed Hitler thought of the two as similar and used that to morally justify his invasions. See the book *The Wages of Destruction* for a good discussion of this.

Science in Nazi Germany was highly politicized. Anyone who didn't get on the mythical "Aryan" bandwagon was sacked or worse. In a scenario where Hitler "won" the war - not necessarily conquer the world, just survive as a regime into the 1950's or 60's, I don't see this really changing.

Most people who have thought through "Alternate Histories" about a postwar Nazi regime see the main threat coming from even more radical Nazis - the pagan/mystical SS clashing with the more Christian "preserve traditional German values" crowd. There was a great book a while back, can't remember the title, that was set during a Nazi "Cultural Revolution" during the 60's where radical ultra-Aryan students "assaulted the party" for its conservatism under the direction of a new Fuhrer who took over after Hitler's death.

In short, no, I think the Nazi ideology was too extreme to ever moderate like the American "manifest destiny" ideology eventually did. Instead it would probably have turned inward on itself and collapsed in a series of purges and crazy attempts to resurrect Atlantis (Thule) or genetically engineer Aryan supermen or some such craziness. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had this practice described to me though I haven't tried it myself. Basically, your read alternating chapters of works from opposing points of view (materialism vs. dualism, right-wing vs. left-wing politics, etc.). 

This supposedly avoids the effect of reading the books in sequence (first one and then the other) and being convinced either by the first or the last one you read, depending on your disposition.

Also you are supposed to see hidden connections, points of agreement or common flaws that the two arguments share. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Until very recently it was a good move as the pay is often a lot better. There is a "special needs" teacher at our district who is assigned to just a single student. The teacher's sole job is to follow this student around all day, and slap her hand back when she tries to touch things/people. Oh, and a bit of paperwork every 6 months. She makes more than twice the salary of a regular teacher.

However, if our state follows NY and some bureaucrat decides that this student needs to take the state standardized tests, this teacher is out of a job.  </TEXT>

Even if you add Z to that list, I assume it is a Boolean function of some kind, telling you if a number is an integer or not? Wouldn't any number still come out to be an integer if you only have 0, 1,+ and * to work with to make other numbers? (I am assuming you mean "x" to be multiply, not a variable name.) </TEXT>

Productivity does affect land value. For example, after the invention of the elevator and modern building techniques, the value of land in or near a city increased dramatically due to the fact you can fit more people and/or make more products with the same amount of land than you could previously.

Likewise, the Internet and telepresence technology has affected land value, but in the opposite direction (reducing demand) </TEXT>

He did note that he focused exclusively on whites to avoid "ethnic issues." But the fact that this guy's book is called "The State of White America" raises the creepy level in the room just a bit. If this is the same Charles Murray who wrote "The Bell Curve," which suggested that blacks "naturally" have an IQ level 15 points below whites, it all starts to fit together.

The point is, 0!=1 is not a "tack on" that has nothing to do with the rest of the definition of a factorial and is just there for convenience so we don't end up dividing by zero. It is implied by the original definition. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a convention, not a theorem. It's been chosen like that because it's useful.

No, that is not correct, it is in the structure of the idea of the factorial. Think of a baseball team of x players. There are x! ways for the coach to order them on a bench for photo. Now imagine if the coach simply wanted a picture of the empty bench (0 players.) There is only one way to order that photo. Therefore 0!=1

A similar argument can be made for the "inevitability" of such seemingly "hacky" definitions such as a^0 = 1. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think we need any fancy Category Theory to solve this problem as some other posters have suggested.

You merely have to distinguish between declarable and constructable entities. For example, I can *declare* "a square circle" by saying these words, but I could never actually construct one.

Similarly, in Set Theory we can say "The set of all sets," but it is not clear if we mean declarable or constructable sets. The set of all declarable sets includes some sets which trigger Russel's Paradox, and thus are not constructable.

When a mathematician is saying "all sets this, all sets that," he is most likely referring to the set of all *constructable* sets.  </TEXT>

Empty of *inherent* selfhood does not mean total emptiness of being, but rather than our selves are unavoidably dependent on the existence of other beings (dependent origination.)

So this is where the vow originates to free all beings - it cannot be any other way, since all being is tied up together. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because as any high school politics student knows, political alignments are not on a line (they're more on a grid, with x and y coordinates, etc.) 

I'm more of a "horseshoe" guy. I think that grid is Libertarian propaganda: "Wow, look, there's a party that believes in *both* types of freedom!" 

Right and left are labels given by American propagandists in the McCarthy era.

No, they come from where the factions sat in the French National Assembly after the Revolution.

His mistake was making his country a socialist dictatorship (communism), rather than a socialist republic.

I don't think he had a choice once he seized power. The majority of the Russian people in 1917 were rural and religious. They would not have voted for Bolshevism if given the chance. A Tolstoy-style religious socialism might have had a better shot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Doesn't matter what they actually do or the fact that social programs are not 'socialism'

Yes, I like how people do not get that social programs are actually a phenomenon of capitalism. There is no welfare in Socialism because everyone is guaranteed a job (and compelled to work.) 

I'm not saying that's a *good* thing, but welfare is Capitalism *preserving* itself from a possible Socialist uprising.

One of Lenin's slogans was "He who does not work, does not eat." Makes him sound like a Tea Party guy, which he was in some strange way, that way the far left and the far right always seem to converge.

By and large though, Hinduism is an inherited tradition. You can't just go sign up to become Hindu like you can for some other religions. The "Western Hindu" groups like the Hare Krishnas and the Rajneeshis are considered fake, heretical or just plain laughable by (most) actual Hindus. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Assuming "The West" means the current hegemonic system lead by the United States, I would advise you to beware the "rhetoric of decline" which is used for political manipulation and doesn't really represent the underlying reality. The US is still the world's largest manufacturer, food exporter and its military technology is light-years ahead of anyone else's.

Unfortunately a number of commenters here have bought in to this rhetoric full-scale. For example, one stated:

china and other nations find themselves with a young strong backbone 

China does not have a young, strong backbone. They overshot their population decades ago, experienced apocalyptic levels of starvation several times, and are still paying the price. Their demographics are completely upside down now and the very old will soon outnumber those of working age.

I wouldn't be surprised if the US, Latin America and India form the power troika of 40 years hence while China, Japan and Europe all suffer greatly just from demographic pressure alone. 

The US will probably no longer be the lone superpower c. 2050 but it's quite possible it will still be one of the top dogs.  </TEXT>

There was a case in a town near ours of a guy high on "bath salts" who tunneled into his neighbor's basement trying to kill him because he thought the guy was having sex with his wife. He had been a longtime marijuana user with no criminal record beyond possession and no history of mental illness.

Part of the problem with "bath salts" is they can be many different chemicals - you don't know what you're getting. I agree with a previous poster who said if marijuana was legal none of this would be happening, because most often this stuff is advertized as "legal pot" and sold in skate shops, head shops, etc. which pot users frequent. </TEXT>

Good post, but I'd disagree with you there. Many Socialists believe there is a basic unchangeable human nature, for example Marx's idea of "primitive Communism" representing the original state of Man that will eventually reappear in the final state.

<TEXT> "Arya" was a word in certain branches of Satem Indo-European that meant "priest," "aristocrat," or "practitioner of the correct religion or correct rituals" depending on the context. It was not used to mean "tribe" or "race." 

It is much more correct to speak of an Aryan religion that is the ancestor of both Vedic Hinduism and Zoroastrianism than an Aryan race.

<TEXT> Here in Michigan the private schools pay for their own buses, textbooks, etc...

Are you sure? I thought that was true in my state as well until a state senator told me otherwise. I was pretty shocked that my taxes pay to bus, heat and equip religious schools.

Have coaches teach gym class. 

They usually do, but they get a separate salary for coaching, at least in most districts in my area.

Require any part of the uniform that isn't customized to be returned at the end of the year (specifically, pants).

Haha, do you know what football uniforms look like by the end of the season? Usually there are multiple uniforms per player for each season because they rip and wear out.

private schools either learn to manage their finances REALLY well, or they disappear because they can't pay the bills.

Or they get the public to foot the bill for them, without any public oversight or standardized test "accountability" that public schools have to follow. Where I live, even some public schools are run by for-profit companies and are exempt from most state regulations, including the obligation to educate special-needs and learning-disabled students. It's sick. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  How did these right winger Italians get to be so racist? You'd be hard pressed to find a more motley assortment of racial mixing than within the Italian peninsula. 

You've answered your own question. Racial identity anxiety is known to be linked with increased racism. See the American South with its rampant underground "miscegenation" during the pre-Civil War period for another example.

Niall Ferguson covers this issue in [The War of the World](http://www.amazon.com/War-World-Twentieth-Century-Conflict-Descent/dp/1594201005) - the book can be a bit dry but the section on racial anxiety is well worth reading. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually, public districts are required by law (at least in my state) to bus private students as well, and even pay for the textbooks and heating costs of private schools (except for religious textbooks.)

Sports cost more than you think - coaches are paid in most districts, uniforms, league fees and transportation are expensive, as is insurance, and "the field" in sports-crazy towns is often more like a minor-league stadium. Then there's the marching band - I know for a fact a large district near me has a marching band budget of nearly $100,000 per year.

Disputes over grades and discipline should be handled by the teacher and the student's family, and maybe the school authorities if necessary. When it comes to grade disputes, parents should be required to provide evidence that their student did not earn the grade received or that the assignment was graded unfairly.

Here I agree with you, but that's not the reality of how things work these days.

If this is legit, it could be a very effective way to check to see if you're dreaming. So my question is - has anyone experienced smell or taste in dreams?

I'm headed to bed to test the theory myself...

**UPDATE:** Didn't work. I ate a whole box of chocolates, and I thought I was tasting them, although, upon awakening, I couldn't recall the taste. So, maybe there is no taste in dreams, but if you *think* you're tasting anyway, it's useless as a reality check. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't see why approaching mental states as legitimate subjects of inquiry should entail that they are irreducible. 

I would distinguish between mental and inner states. A "mental state" could just be a stage of a process, like a machine state. An "inner state" to me presupposes some sort of qualitative barrier between process and perception.

My whole point in this discussion is basically I don't know how qualia could ever be considered "states" in the "machine state" or "process state" mould, therefore we can't talk about qualia without presupposing a different kind of "state" that is not a stage of a process.

In other words, I am arguing that reductionism rules out qualia and consciousness as legitimate concepts. That doesn't mean I consider reductionism *wrong* (I am up in the air about that), merely that I think those are the inevitable consequences of accepting it.

we already know a lot more than we did 20 years ago about how the brain handles vision, conscious awareness, religious experiences...

I'd agree with the first and last of those, but not the middle one. Explaining the neural correlates of consciousness is not explaining consciousness, unless doing so can "explain away" consciousness as a meaningful idea, a la Dennet's attempt.

I think that consciousness, as well as qualia, must either be null or radically other. I don't see the middle ground like you seem to.

The idea that maybe they [animals] are just automata that happen to behave in a certain way while experiencing nothing is a remote skeptical possibility akin to "what if we're really brains in a vat?" or "what if other humans are really unconscious zombies?"

It's not remote since many believe that we humans are such automata as well. We can at least say that humans have the *concept* of qualia, even if it turns out not to refer to anything. We can't communicate this concept to animals so we have no way of telling what qualitative experience they may or may not have.

On the ethical side, though, I agree with you: In the absence of strong evidence otherwise it is ethical to assume that humans and animals both experience qualia.

Since our qualia seem to be in continual flux, that suggests to me that it must be a process (or more likely, a set of processes).

I think you're confusing change in stimuli with mental processes. They're two different things. I'm saying - how does qualia fluctuate *if the stimuli remains the same*? A point stimuli or a constant stimuli can kick off a whole cascade of processes but it only seems to generate one immediate, constant quale. Red only becomes "less red" when the rods in my eyes saturate (a physical process). The fact that the quale goes away when I look at something else is not the issue.

then some subset of those feedback connections would be projecting into the visual cortex and incorporating that information into the stream of consciousness. 

The problem is, it doesn't appear as a "stream" or a "process," but as a pointlike experience. Obviously a process assembles that experience before it is "presented" to the awareness, but what is it that can apprehend the entire process instantaneously?

Again, it's not enough to say "well, it really doesn't happen instantaneously, we've proven in the lab that there's a lag of 40 milliseconds" or whatever. Why does it *appear* instantaneous? Where does this sense come from? 

Why a major problem [with Blindsight]? To me it just suggests that it's possible to have a visual experience (however degraded) that one is not consciously aware of. 

Because it argues against the *role* consciousness has been assigned in current reductionist theories, which is as *the name we give to the processing of stimuli via mental states.* Here is a complex mental state in response to a stimuli, with *no conscious component*. That's a huge problem in my book.

Reductionists could fall back on the older view of consciousness as a pure epiphenomenon, an "impotent narrator," but that view has been out of fashion for some time and for good reason.

maybe there is crosstalk in the circuits which, while relatively data-poor, allows patients to perform slightly above chance (which is all they find in performance tests).

[This article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7794783.stm) seems to suggest something a good deal more shocking than "performing slightly above chance." Key quote:

"A video recording shows him completing the obstacle course set up by the scientists "flawlessly", without the aid of his cane or another person."

Also he can respond to facial expressions which is one of the most complex tasks of the brain and I doubt it can be explained by weak cross-talk.

You might be interested in the work of Colin McGinn on this subject.

I can only wonder if these pessimists have ever actually opened a neuroscience textbook, because the way they talk, you'd expect neuroscience books to be 2 pages long!

A lot of them are Philosophers of the Mind, so I *hope* they have read neuroscience, though you never know. Anyway the pessimists aren't so much saying "we can never figure out the brain" in the heuristic sense of figuring out what region processes what, as they are saying that the "deep truths" we want to find by studying the brain, such as "is reductionism true?" simply aren't accessible, and perhaps aren't even intelligible concepts.

Note this is different from saying "consciousness isn't an intelligible concept," it is a level of abstraction removed. The pessimists are saying "asking whether or not consciousness is an intelligible concept is not an answerable question."

Going back to McGinn again he is also sympathetic to this idea though I think at heart he's a non-reductionist though he doesn't declare openly for that.

I'm not one of these pessimists myself but the way that very smart people (a lot more educated than I am) continually seem to talk past and misunderstand each other on this subject makes me queasy that they may be right. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The tendency to over-define vague terms and then follow those definitions to their logical conclusions gets philosophers into muddles.

True, and that might be the problem with qualia. 

I fear we're constructing a pantheon of very slippery inner states, and then postulating new mental states to cover up for the holes in our initial description. In this practice, we quickly reach a point where our main limiting factor is our imagination.

That's my fear also.

My worry is not that there aren't any such inner states to describe, but that our description is theory-rich and data-poor, and therefore we may be misdescribing them rather badly.

I hope so, and I hope more data might shed some light on these questions. However, as of now I can't see a way out of the trap. Accepting "inner states" to any degree seems to entail accepting the whole ridiculous pantheon of irreducible and incommensurable qualia. Rejecting "inner states" means discounting phenomenological observation altogether, which seems almost as ridiculous.

Can't we be pretty sure that animals experience pain? They behave like they're in pain, they have neural wiring similar to that which processes pain in humans, similar stimuli seem to cause pain in animals. 

I'm not as confident. We don't know where in the brain qualia are produced, if they even exist (and if they are even produced by the brain, if they exist.) They may be produced only in the prefrontal cortex, which animals don't possess to the same degree. Animals may simply process the stimuli of pain without any accompanying qualia. It's impossible to know, but I also think it's immoral to assume that they don't and that it's ok to hurt animals.

(btw, the fact that almost all moral systems are implicitly based on the existence of qualia is what makes a lot of people so leery about qualophobes, regardless of the evidence.)

This isn't obvious to me. Actually since qualia fluctuate over time, it seems to me that they are almost certainly processes.

How do qualia fluctuate in your view? Do you mean only if the stimuli changes? We would agree there. But not if the stimuli remains the same. They seem to be point-like experiences to me. Sure, a color will fade if you look at it too long because the rods in your eyes get saturated, but that's a different issue.

A desktop computer is a serial processor and will process these in sequence... whereas our brain's architecture is massively parallel, allowing it to perform many computations simultaneously. 

Actually, modern computers are massively parallel as well. I'm not denying that the brain processes imagery in parallel. Obviously it does. What bothers me is that these parallel processes then seem to produce outputs that are presented to our awareness as a unity.

Blindsight shows that visual stimuli response can function independently of any visual experience. This is a major problem for reductionists.

I have a feeling you're going to tell me this doesn't help, but I'm not sure why.

I'm concerned with how we experience a process as a unity, a point-like experience. That's where I see a weakness in the reductionist argument. 

If the non-reductionists can somehow tame the zoo of qualia, I might "go over" to their side. I'm not there yet though. I'm more thinking a third approach might be needed, but I have no idea what that could be. 

I'm also more sympathetic now than I used to be to the epistemological pessimists who think the mind can no more think about itself than a hammer can hammer itself, that our minds are designed to be "turned outwards towards the world" and that too much introspection on mental states inevitably leads to logical knots, simply because we're not designed to process that sort of information.

<TEXT> I'm not too familiar with this position. Is this Dennett's view?

More or less. Though he's too canny to ever say so in such simple terms, in my reading he thinks both qualia and consciousness are "null pointers" - words that don't really refer to anything meaningful. For a while I thought he had the true picture - right down the the competing networks of Darwinian neurons fighting for dopamine - but now I'm not so sure.

higher vs. lower functions...

I would take a Heideggerian approach to this question. Anything "ready to hand" that we can use in a transparent fashion without  rational thinking is a lower function, even if it was set by practicing it as a higher function (for example that choke hold, which had to be puzzled out and learned before it became automatic) Anything "unready to hand" that requires us to activate our reasoning skills is a higher function. 

I'm not sure if I agree with the entailment from propositional attitudes to qualia or not. If I say "I believe that 2+2=4" how would we characterize the corresponding quale?

*Believing* it, as opposed to merely using the fact in a process, would entail the quale of the emotion of belief, the feeling we get when we look at something we know to be true. 2 + 2 = 5 is not just a false statement, it triggers a different quale when we see it (in the qualophile's view.)

we want to know why all this processing is accompanied by "inner feels." Maybe 'qualia' is not the best concept with which to get a handle on the problem, but turning a blind eye to it doesn't seem like a solution.

Exactly.  I agree. However, the reason *why* I agree has to do with the simultaneity of visual perception, which I will try to explain below.

I think a strong case can be made for the existence of qualia in non-linguistic animals (think animal pain, blue dot on the forehead test, food preferences, etc.)

I'm not sure. If you believe in qualia, you believe there's a difference between "seeing blue" the way a computer can (or seeing a face the way Cottrel's network can), and really *seeing blue* (seeing the quale not processing the wavelength.) Since we can't communicate like this with animals, we can't know for certain either way.

Damn. Sorry man, I'm just not understanding why this is a problem.

Ok, I'll be glad to try again. Thanks for sticking with this discussion! 

Reductionist theories of mind run into a problem when they encounter mental phenomena that *don't seem to be processes*. Thought is a process. Emotion, Demasio and others have argued with merit, is a process. Qualia are obviously not processes but the very concept of qualia is shaky. 

But what about visual perception? Phenomenologically, it doesn't seem (and seeming is what's important here, since we're talking about inner states) that I see first the cat, then the lamp, and process these two concepts like a computer program would that could recognize multiple objects in a picture (these do exist.)

Rather, I seem to apprehend both of them *at the same time*. Visual perception appears not to be a process but rather a *pointlike experience* that is nevertheless very rich in data.

It is the nature of visual perception, at once pointlike in time and vast in the amount of stimuli that is perceived, that seems very un-process-like.

If we accept that it is not a process, we should also be more open to the idea that other non-processed mental states like qualia also might exist (where there's one monkey, there's more...). 

I'm starting to suspect that qualia might indeed exist, and only be *mediated* by language, which can open or foreclose access to them depending on the grammar, and not created as an illusion of language, and the reason there's no sharp cutoff between "redness" and "orangeness" is because there's just one color qualia that exists as a continuum.

But this opens a huge can of worms. Qualia must either be null or *radically* Other, beyond all category of thought or understanding. Even a thoroughgoing dualism in the traditional sense seems to leave no room for qualia. You would need an unbounded pluralism of incommensurable experiences, each its own separate ineffable Universe and yet somehow united within our minds. That sounds like the sort of conceptual disaster that usually results from having started from wrong premises.

So I'm still torn on the qualia issue.

Is there a wiki page on this?

I couldn't find anything more specific than stuff on qualia and the Hard Problem. There are some technical articles that talk about the problems of simultaneity and I remember reading about this issue in Penrose and Chalmers (who proposed quantum and dualistic solutions, respectively.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> making the most serious attempts to give a legitimate explanation of qualia (as opposed to the defeatists who seem to suggest that qualia are magical and inexplicable).

Or those who think they're just a trick of language?

"Language of thought" folks believe that this is essentially language-like whereas eliminativists of the Churchland variety think that the brain's basic cognitive processes are rather non-language-like

I think both views are simplistic. Our "higher" cognitive functions are obviously language-like in processing, at least in my view, whereas "instinct"-type reactions are not. Habits fall in between the two - that's why they can be so hard to break.

As far as I can tell the questions are entirely independent. 

Why I think the two issues are fundamentally the same is that, as far as I understand the concept, a propositional attitude must have an intentional object. It is hard to see how such an object can be anything other than a quale. 

If there truly are propositional attitudes such as "I would like to have a beer," rather than simple processes that report such sentences as part of their functioning, then the quale for the taste of beer is implied.

I know the eliminationists don't believe in these attitudes, and I thought they didn't believe in quales either, but you say they are merely "reductionist" in relation to quales. I don't quite see the difference because according to the classic definition at least, quales are irreducible. A reduced quale is a non-existent one.

Skeptical in what sense? Skeptical that the term 'qualia' refers to anything at all? 

Yes. For a while I was in the "it's all just a trick of language" school and I still think those arguments have a lot of merit. For example, if there is a quale that embodies "redness," when we see a color shift for example in a computer graphics display, we should notice a sharp cutoff where "redness" changes to "orangeness," but we don't. 

Also, people who speak languages that don't distinguish between "blue" and "green," Japanese for example, have been shown to be able to see less shades in that color range than English-speakers. All this points to quales somehow arising from language and not being fundamental.

Where I've started to doubt that view, however, is in the appearance of the simultaneity of visual perception. Looking at the room right now, I see a lamp, and a cat, *apparently at the same time*, and as distinct objects, not a blob combining the qualities of both (a furry, purring lamp for example.) 

How is this possible? If the mind is a mere process, how does this perception arise? There should only be reaction to visual stimuli, as with the Blindsight phenomenon, but nothing else. Yet something else appears that, unlike color quales, it is quite difficult to explain as a trick of language.

Before you chalk me up as a disciple of the Time Cube guy, the two dimensions of time and String Theory stuff was partly tongue-in-cheek, but this problem seems so vexing I wonder if this or a similarly bizarre explanation will eventually be needed.

What I was referring to is that in String Theory there are "extra" dimensions that are not linear, but rather curled around the three dimensions we know and love. Much like a tightrope walker will perceive a tightrope as one dimension, but an ant will see two (the ant can go forward and backward as well as around the "curled up" dimension that composes the rope itself.), in String Theory at a small scale our Universe has 10 or 11 spatial dimensions, not 3.

What I was proposing was that perhaps time also has a String Theory-like "curled up" dimension and that's how visual perception can be a process yet still somehow seem presented as a unity to the mind.

And of course Roger Penrose is a physicist who became interested in the philosophy of the mind and concluded that quantum physics must somehow be involved, launching an entire industry of bad New Age books misinterpreting his ideas. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the detailed reply. You're lucky you got to work with some of the most eminent modern philosophers - whether I agree with them or not, that's quite an experience and one I wish I could have had.

So obviously your experience with them is very extensive and I'll take your word for it on what their true views are. However, I am puzzled by a couple of things you said:

believe that neuroscience science will explain qualia.

That is the qualophobic position, if I am correct. "phobic" is just an unfortunate appelation that this position got stuck with. It doesn't literally mean they are *afraid* to address the issue qualia, just that they think qualia can be reduced to neurology without either a dualistic or an emergent order.

they all agree that there is something wrong with folk psychology but they can disagree radically as to what (for the Churchlands, it's propositional attitudes, for others it's qualia or consciousness).

I don't think there's really much of a difference between propositional attitudes and qualia, fundamentally. They both seem to refer to mental states that can't be reduced to mere *processes*, and that's the real issue in my book.

I'm pretty skeptical about qualia myself, both internal and external, but the one phenomenon I don't think has been explained is the simultaneity of distinct objects of visual perception, and that one thread kind of lets everything else in again through the back door. 

It's not enough to say that vision merely *appears* simultaneous, obviously it's not and many studies have proven this (including the infamous "gorilla" experiment), because it's appearances that are the issue. Why should it appear simultaneous? How does this unity, however illusory it might be, manifest? I don't know of any reductionist philosopher who's explained that to my satisfaction.

I have an admittedly crazy theory that there are two dimensions of time, the other one curled up around our familiar dimension like the extra dimensions of String Theory, and that the unity of visual perception is processed in that dimension, using some Penrose-style quantum woo-woo hand-waving, and then somehow "presented" back to the ordinary mind as a unity.

So if you don't think I'm entirely bonkers after hearing that, I'd love to hear any further thoughts you might have on the subject, given that even formidable minds have said what we should do with this issue is just "sweep it aside and hope for the best"

<TEXT> I don't think any philosopher from Plato on would disagree that "love" is a muddled concept that refers to many different things. 

I do think the Churchlands are far more radical than the rather uncontroversial critique you ascribe to them: In my reading of their position, they think "love" refers to not many different states, but to *nothing* - that the behaviors we ascribe to "love" have *no affective states behind them whatsoever*, any more than there is some being called Zeus behind the phenomenon of thunder.

In essence they are extreme qualophobes - they not only deny external qualia like "red," but internal qualia as well such as emotions. Some see them and the rest of the EM school as the heirs to the Behaviorists, but all the Behaviorists said was that the "black box" of internal states could not be studied scientifically - they never said that internal states didn't exist.

I've by no means read their corpus, so their position may have evolved since my last encounter with their work, but that's how I read their position at the time. </TEXT>

In essence they are extreme qualophobes - they not only deny external qualia like "red," but internal qualia as well such as emotions. Some see them and the rest of the EM school as the heirs to the Behaviorists, but all the Behaviorists said was that the "black box" of internal states could not be studied scientifically - they never said that internal states didn't exist.

I've by no means read their corpus, so their position may have evolved since my last encounter with their work, but that's how I read their position at the time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Before you suggest "Ghost in the Shell," this was NOT Ghost in the Shell, I've seen every movie and episode, and this wasn't it.

What I remember for sure: It was quite similar to Ghost in the Shell. It involved cops in Japan with tank-like robot assistants. The plot was convoluted, but in the end it was revealed the evil mastermind was an old man who lived in a giant dome who was trying to merge trees and robots to create a new form of life. In the end his plot was foiled, but all the tank-robots were destroyed in the process.

Stuff I *think* I remember: It was on Adult Swim, in the early 2000's, but my friend thinks it was on MTV instead.  </TEXT>
