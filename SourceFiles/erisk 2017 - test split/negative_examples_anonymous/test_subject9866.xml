<TEXT> Check the major retailers' websites first. Nike, Footlocker, Champs, etc. to see if they have the colourway you want. If not, then go to eBay. As /u/stewpidteenager said, *get a legit check first*. Last think you want is some fake shoes.

How you would go about that is posting a link to the listing on here or some pictures of the shoes and the nice members of this subreddit will help you out. Cheers, and good luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember playing this game around 5 or 6 years ago or so. It was a medieval-ish cartoon looking game. **First person**, you went around slashing people and stuff like that. 

The colors red and brown stand out to me. [As well as a rope bridge with like wooden logs.] (http://quad-atv.specs-sa.com/Images/berakah/three_meter_bridge_approach.jpg)'

Sorry for the vague description, it was all I could remember. Thanks for any help you can give me!

In my opinion, the "Alternate" Pack is the best. But in terms of *individual shoes*, I think that the 5 lows from the "Dunk From Above" pack is the best colourway. The contrast in the White/Navy combination with the hints of gold really sell it for me.

What are your opinions? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wear what you think looks good dude.

Something I suggest is to buy a shoe, and let it sit in the open. Look at it for a while. Try it on, walk around the house with it, etc.

If you start to like it, then keep 'em. Money well spent. If *not*, then return them. It's that simple. </TEXT>

Or [Converse] (http://www.converse.com/regular/chuck-taylor-classic-colors/MP_51.html), cause you can never go wrong with some Chucks. </TEXT>
