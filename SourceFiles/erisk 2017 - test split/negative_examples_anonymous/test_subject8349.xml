<TITLE> Obsessed with checking the dictionary when reading in a foreign language </TITLE>

<TEXT> I'm Portuguese, and until a couple months ago I hadn't touched a book for years. Not by my choice, anyway.

 I like the English language and I feel pretty comfortable with it. I learned it by reading/writing stuff online, watching movies and TV series, playing video games, etc, and I usually understand nearly everything I read/hear. Until... I decided to start reading books in English. I  bought **The Richest Man in Babylon** and **The Old Man and the Sea**. I can understand the plot, but damn, there are sooooo many words I've never heard of and have no idea of their meaning.
Lots of times I immediately check an online dictionary, and feel uncomfortable if I don't because then I'll never expand my vocabulary and this problem will never be fixed.


I'm sure most people who read in foreign languages felt this at some point. So... do you have any tips?

Thanks :) </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A friend of mine has a 30 player Obliteration server in the USA, but even though it's set as "Official", no one joins. Sometimes we have a few players there to help populate the server, but it's no help.

In fact, the only US-based Obliteration server that is ever populated is  **[*=SAS=* SASKLAN.COM 24/7 Obliteration TrinityGames](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/servers/show/pc/f04dd74b-3f45-415c-af42-6206474c6e62/SAS-SASKLAN-COM-24-7-Obliteration-TrinityGames/)** . My guess is that most people who join this server have added it to the favorites? I don't know.

Do you guys have any tips on how to help a server grow? And what would you like to see in an Obliteration server? DLC maps? Increased time limit? Autobalance? </TEXT>

<TITLE> herdProtect - 68 antimalware engine scanner </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-14 19:53:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've recently found this program that is pretty much VirusTotal but a PC antimalware software. It scans your PC with [68 malware engines.](https://www.herdprotect.com/engines.aspx)

**It's cloud based.** Scanning is really fast (2 minutes-ish), but it can be slower since some suspicious [PE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable) files (like .exe, .dll) and non-PE stuff like browser extensions can get uploaded. But I mean, these days many antiviruses rely on cloud technologies, so there's probably no reason to be paranoid. And PE files aren't usually huge, though if there are a lot of them to be uploaded and your connection is slow... could take a bit more).
It's kinda like [Hitman Pro](http://www.surfright.nl/en/hitmanpro/), but with more engines. 

After the scan is complete it shows the detected files, and if you click them you can see which antivirus engines detected it. **Keep in mind there could be a lot of false positives**, since it uses 68 engines. If you have a lot of cracked software, like I do, keep an eye out before blindly removing everything. But I think it has an option to "hide possible false positives", though it's far from perfect.

Anyway, I figured this could be useful to you guys. I'll still use MBAM and Emsisoft as the big guns to clean infected PCs, but this could be used as a way to make sure you got rid of everything.


Cheers!

edit: "herdProtect - 68 engine antimalware scanner" is probably more correct. Ehhh.. what the heck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [These tutorials](http://thelegendofrandom.com/blog/sample-page) are also great for absolute beginners. They teach you what reverse engineering is, really basic ASM stuff, how to use Ollydbg and some other tools... The little I know about RE was from those tutorials. You'll be able to crack (really) basic shareware protections by the end of the series.

But to crack games... much more experience and ASM knowledge is needed, and for today's protections I don't think there are many openly available tutorials. Cd checks (old Securom, Safedisc) and Steam emulation tutorials are probably the best you can get. </TEXT>

 We find that R* use some machine info check to protect GTA5,just like Denuvo did in Dragon Age Inquisition.
 But i think Denuvo is still much harder to be cracked than RGSC.

<TEXT> So, here's what I "found". I couldn't run the setup properly because of the "You don't have the game installed" messagebox. BUT, they're using some crap installer with content you can extract with Winrar/7zip. [It's 2 DLLs \(setup-related I think\), and the GTA V launcher.](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=1DA9308D1CF31D10!566 authkey=!AP4BLF7E0XbqRr4 ithint=folder%2cexe) You can run it. It downloads and installs Social Club, and then asks you for login (not sure what happens after). I tried using PEiD to check if it's protected, but it says "Not a valid PE file". I loaded it into IDA, and checked the strings, it's obvious it's packed (well, that was expected). </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-04-04 00:27:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I do.
Well. Let me get this straight. I payed 60 for this at launch (March 20). I got:

* Way less weapons than BF4

* Standard edition. BF4 had that special edition for the SAME price (60) and it included the China Rising DLC with 4 new maps.

* Poorer performance than BF4. It's PunkBuster? It's my PC that sucks? I don't care what's the excuse. It runs on the same engine as BF4 and the game feels choppy, specially in 64 players. Believe me, I tried capping the FPS, messing around in NVIDIA Control Panel. BF4 always runs smooth.

* Clusterfuck Call of Duty maps. I used to consider myself an infantry guy, but my god. It always feels like TDM in the main modes (Blood Money   Heist). ***Spawn. Dead. Spawn. Dead.***  If I try to play the objective I kinda enjoy it a bit. But it gets boring after a while.

* Boring and pointless campaign. I know Battlefield never was about singleplayer, but they promised us a "Visceral-quality campaign", and what did we get? The same boring crap.

The launch was somewhat smooth because this is a Battlefield 4 rip off. Yet they still managed to fuck up Punkbuster.

As if that weren't enough, it's now for sale on Origin, two weeks after the release, for **39.99!**

I feel like an idiot. But well. EA won't fool me again. I learned my lesson. **They charge 60 because that's what people are willing to pay for the game.** </TEXT>

Even "back in the day" there were members joining and leaving all the time, judging from old NFOs I found on [defacto2](http://www.defacto2.net/).

<TEXT> All the very popular games still get cracked but with no demand for the smaller ones, scene groups don't bother

Actually, I see many meaningless Steam being released by the scene, while titles with lots of demand (FIFA 15 and Dragon Age Inquisition, for example) aren't released, not even [internally](https://scenelingo.wordpress.com/2008/07/16/what-does-internal-mean/). 
I think the increasing toughness of DRM is the reason.

<TEXT> There have been reports of that, but I think such cases are rare.

**Prototype.2.Proper-SKIDROW**
 So now we have decided to proper Fairlight's Prototype 2 release,
because our crack is fully reversed and CEG free. Which gives the end
user a more stable crack, with less crashes, startup problems gone,
fast loading, better framerates etc. are some of the problems that our
fully reversed crack prevents.

Worth mentioning that in some cases, properly removing DRM might actually improve the performance.

**Prototype 2 STATEMENT READNFO-FLT**

Here we
have Securom as protection, what is known to slow down a game's performance
in general, with more protection features activated, the more of a
performance hit you might see in theory. 

As someone said it, if the game is not updated (it's done manually, so there are many pirates who probably don't bother doing it), you might be playing an unoptimized version of the game. Fortunately, both the Scene and the P2P usually release updates.

<TEXT> Demo division is still active (a couple of their members will be in Revision 2015 Easterparty). Not much is known about their warez division, though, but it might have something to do with their member dycus dying. **Rayman_Origins__RiP_DYCUS-Razor1911**:

He was the one behind many Trainers
    and without him even our few releases wouldn't have seen the light of day as
    he was the best game tester you could think of. 

This is also very interesting:
**Response.To.Our.Recent.Nukes
.SCENENOTiCE-WaLMaRT**
This is where we introduce **Cracker B**. The guy was
very well spoken and appeared to be very skilled.
He was able to patch CEG games for us in a fast and
efficient manor. He claimed to be an ex member of
Two other groups, which he backed up by sharing their
tools with us.
- SteamStub Unpacker Enigine 0.4 Win 8 Version
- Origin Unpacking Dumping Engine 0.2
These tools included an icon with a **Razor logo**,
so we can only assume they came from there. None
of these tools were used in any of our release, we
were making our own. Cracker B was purely showing
off the fact that he was in possession of these tools.
After some time we received another nuke, this time
concerning suspicions that the release was stolen from
a P2P source.
Tensions were high in the group after the nuke and the
member was soon banned. **He has since moved on to another
group with Cracker B**

Now, I have no idea if it's common for groups to share tools, but I guess it's not, since it takes a lot of effort to develop them. So is this "**Cracker B**" a former Razor1911 member? If so, I wonder what's that group he moved to...

<TEXT> Steam games are the most popular, but they seem like the worst titles to crack if they want their e-penis to grow. I mean, everyone cracks Steam. Well, by everyone I don't mean just about anyone who can open a disassembler, but you can actually find some documentation about reversing Steam in the open web, and many, many P2Pers do it just fine. I actually recall SKIDROW mocking FLT for only cracking "lame Sims expansions" which only had some disc-check protection. Remember when Razor1911 released The_Settlers_7-Razor1911? They said they didn't care about cracking Assassin's Creed 2 for technical details, that The Settlers had the true real Ubisoft DRM, and thus they just waited. Now, if more games == bigger dick, they would have just released ACII... right? I think the tougher the protection the more bragging rights. But then why doesn't FLT start cracking harder stuff? I'm confused... :/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> Scene releases usually follow [some rules](http://www.sbytes.info/NFOwb.php?id=Rules.For.The.Game.Scene.Charts) that can actually mean better cracks. Most times you might not even feel the difference, though, since it's mostly technical stuff. Also, sceners can proper each other until there's a working release, and their reputation is important to them, so we're less likely to see poor quality stuff (SKIDROW doesn't apply to this, of course :P ) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't wish we had less Steam releases. In fact, it's quite the opposite, since there's much more scene competition with Steam. My point is that protections are getting tougher to crack, specially if you follow the old scene rules, and it's easy to see that groups are avoiding such DRMs and sticking with simpler ones like Steam, which one day may be in danger as well, since DRMs tend to get tighter over time, not worse.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think most downloaders realize what's happening in the PC-ISO scene. I haven't payed attention to it for as long as some you might have (let's say, since the early 2000s), but the future seems dark. I feel that there until 3-4 years ago there was a lot more competition. I mean, what's happening these days? FLT cracks nothing but a few Steam releases, RELOADED cracks UbiDRM, most Steam Releases and some Origin releases. Oh yeah, let's talk about the Origin stuff. Not looking good.

 FIFA.13.INTERNAL-RELOADED 

 Crysis.3.INTERNAL-RELOADED

 Crysis.3.Crackfix.INTERNAL-RELOADED

 Crysis.3.Crackfix.2.INTERNAL-RELOADED

 Crysis.3.Update.v1.2.INTERNAL-RELOADED

Not to mention The.Sims.4-RELOADED that was released like a month after the P2P release, and FIFA 15 that wasn't released by any scene group at all.

SKIDROW used to be annoying with their rushed P2Pish cracks, but at least they tried hard. Now they pretty much only release Steam stuff and get into little girl fights with RELOADED (check out Assassins.Creed.Unity.v1.5.Update.STATEMENT-SKIDROW).

CODEX looks promising, but I guess we'll have to wait and see.

And where's the old Razor1911 in all of this? Cracking Linux and OSX stuff from time to time...

I'll be visiting London for the first time next month. Is it okay to address men as "sir" and women as "ma'am" in the UK? While I don't think "sir" would be much of a problem, I think I read somewhere that some women don't like being addressed as "ma'am" as it's usually used with old ladies.

Thanks in advance :)

<TEXT> Lol don't even get me started on YIFY :p All of their 1080p releases have bitrates of ~2000 Kbps. Pretty much every 720p scene release I've ever downloaded is at least twice that.
Although I traditionally prefer scene PC-ISO/apps releases too, as protections get tougher some stuff is either gonna take a VERY long time to be released, or won't be released at all, thanks to their rules. Some fine examples of that are The Sims 4 and the new Dragon Age. This is where 3DM and their friends come in with their v6 crackfixes 'really workz now!', but well, it's better than nothing, I guess.
And well, I think SKIDROW has failed me more than P2P (Far.Cry.4-SKIDROW) :P </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really wasn't expecting to get so many replies, specially with so many explanations (I read all of them).
First, [here's the Google Form's summary of the responses.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1AU3sEVFAlJ9kpGZkkZjrxPlZx2tGoI_hxxgURzWl0Ac/viewanalytics#start=publishanalytics)

I noticed that it just had the names of the countries and not a graph. So I made [this interactive map.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CC6VcZIpSAF5Jq0ScFTX1j_dPiiGa1_RDUXjGa95mRc/pubchart?oid=528833391 format=interactive) 

Some interesting stuff (keep in mind that there's not as much data on non-Americans, non-whites and females):

* 64.4% of the USA participants think their country's dominant race will become a minority in it.

* 14.3% of the females would not have an interracial relationship, while only 6% of the males wouldn't.

* 78.4% of non-hispanic whites like being the race that they are, while this is only true for 63.3% of the participants of other races.

* "Propaganda" was the least popular factor of influence with an average of 0,83/4, while the most popular was "personal experiences in real life" with an average of 3,155/4. 

I also made a word cloud (using [this)](http://www.wordle.net/) with the words in all of the explanations you guys gave, [here it is.](http://i.imgur.com/QEIPSP8.png)

Finally, [here is a copy of the raw data in spreadsheet form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PqQb7pyPrXcdoHD8kbF_4R8xdB8kWIJarvHTeeVywck/edit?usp=sharing)

<TEXT> My parents used to go to the supermarket thinking I would close the door when they left. And I usually did, but  one day I had my ear plugs on as I was studying, and didn't hear them leave. After a while, I seem to hear some small noise. I open the door and there are 2 filthy gypsy women in the kitchen. My heart starts racing and I pretend I believe their "oh we thought this home was for rent - or is it your neighbor's?" bullshit, as I'm physically weak and don't want trouble. One of them asked to go to the bathroom while the other one kept developing that fake story. When my parent's arrived, besides cleaning the toilet, they noticed some gold stuff we had (like necklaces we've been offered at our birth) had gone missing. 
Now I'm just hoping the government decides to cut welfare for these pieces of cancer. But I doubt it, in Europe we love supporting those who not only do nothing for us, but also damage our lives :) </TEXT>

Now all of a sudden it seems that new games start to stutter, even though I upgraded to a GTX 760 (not top of the line, but hey, I get enough frames per second with it). Watch_Dogs, AC Unity, Far Cry 4... I know they're poorly optimized crap, but still, there are people with similar graphic cards who don't suffer from it.

<TITLE> What's the best lesson you learned from your grandfather? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-28 21:28:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My grandfather once told me something I consider to be incredibly useful and valuable to me.
It was a story, back from the old days when he worked. His workplace had a cafeteria, which sometimes had a full stock of food and beverages. Certain greedy workers noticed this and started taking them home and/or wasting them. And of course, after a while, there weren't enough food and beverages.
 "If we use our resources slowly, they'll always be enough.
 But if we get greedy and abuse them, they'll never be enough".

Fortunately he's still alive, but since he's 81, I fear it won't be for long :(

<TEXT> A woman pregnant with triplets was a victim in a robbery, and was shot 3 times in the belly. She went to the doctor and he said although the bullets reached the triplets, it wasn't in a critical zone, and eventually the bullets would come out their bodies. 2 healthy girls and a boy were born.

After 12 years, one of the girls was peeing, when she peed the bullet.

- "Mommy, some metal thing just came out of me" - she said.
So, mom explained to her what had happened when she was pregnant.
A week after that, the other girl was peeing, the same thing happened, and the mom explained it again.

After another week, the boy was in the bathroom and calls his mom.

- "Mom, you won't believe what just happened!" - he screamed.

- "It's OK son, you just peed some metal thing, wasn't it?" - she replied.

- "What? No! I was masturbating here in the bathroom when suddenly our dog died". </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm rather new to the Battlefield universe. I've only played BF3 (singleplayer) and BF4 (singleplayer + 400 hours of multiplayer) and I like the fact they offer modern warfare, but not futuristic (at least, not that much until Final Stand).
I just don't care for futuristic games with robots and super galactic weapons and stuff like that. I think Titanfall and COD are already enough when it comes to this matter, despite their differences to Battlefield. 

Then again, I might be wrong. I didn't play BF2142 after all. What's your opinion? </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're comparing Origin to an always online DRM. Origin is NOT an always online DRM. You need an Internet connection to activate a game, and that's it. Maybe people will change their opinion on Origin as it might bring those sales you're talking about. But that won't happen for always online DRM, because it causes the problems I mentioned in the other post. I have absolutely no idea why you say Steam can bring any optimization to a game. Dude, SteamCEG is known for actually decreasing the performance (most DRMs do this to some point, but they certainly never improve it). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, I like the way you think, Mr. EA's CEO. Take a sh!t on paying costumers by making a singleplayer game dependent on a stable server connection. And yeah, the online DRM totally worked with Simcity. Everyone could play the game when it was released, and EA got so much love for it. Just like Ubisoft did with their always online DRM a few years ago. Last, but not least, a new study showed that games with aggressive DRM usually sell more. Take a look at Sims 3, for example, it had an uncrackable DRM (CD checks, lol) and thanks to that it sold 10 million units. </TEXT>

You can easily play this game on High @1080p, but that CPU would be kind of a bottleneck.

<TEXT> You reverse engineer software to understand how it works, and can then do stuff like bypassing the copy protection, analyzing its malicious behavior (if it's a malware) or fix it. 

When I didn't know anything at all about reversing, I started reading [these](http://thelegendofrandom.com/blog/sample-page) tutorials. The first ones will introduce you to reverse engineering/cracking, and teach you to use the (main) tool to crack software, called a Disassembler. A Disassembler converts binary/hexadecimal code to instructions of Assembly code.

You see, you can't easily "edit" an .exe. After the guys who make a software program it, they compile it to the .exe, and it's all converted to Assembly code. Assembly code is incredibly confusing and no one in 2014 still programs in it, it's really only used in reversing. [Here's](http://www.ollydbg.de/Pics/OllyDbg2.gif)  what it looks like. I know it looks like hell, but those tutorials I mentioned will explain the basics. At some point, though, you'll want to learn Assembly to make sense of ALL of it.

The disassembler you'll be using is called OllyDBG, the one in that picture. It's included in the tutorials, as everything you possibly need. With it you can see that Assembly code that makes-up programs, see the text strings they have, etc.

They start by teaching you how to crack simple software known as "Crackmes". After a while, easy commercial software will be included, so you can practice on real targets.

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to crack simple commercial software, although this can be reeaaaly time consuming. Please note cracking DRM like Origin, Steam and Battle.net is much harder than the targets you'll be cracking, and you might only be able to do this after years of reversing.

[Tuts4you](https://forum.tuts4you.com) is a community of reversers who's always glad to help you. One rule, though, is to NEVER give info about what software you're trying to crack. 

So here's the more in depth explanation :)
Cheers!

<TEXT> Ha, it is indeed. I've spent 15+ hours trying to patch an unpacked VisualBasic program, but still can't. By going deeper into the calls before the conditional jumps that decide *goodboy* or *badboy*, I couldn't find the place where the serial verification is done at startup, and that can get frustrating.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No. There are no real movies in 4k yet, many TV channels still broadcast in 720p and the price of a 4k TV is ridiculous. By the time 4k gets popular, they will be 1/2 or 1/3 of their current price. As someone suggested, a 4k monitor might make a difference, though. 4k gaming is great, and a huge monitor can be great if you usually have many windows opened. </TEXT>
