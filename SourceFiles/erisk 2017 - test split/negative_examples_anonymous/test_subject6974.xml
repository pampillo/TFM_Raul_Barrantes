<TEXT> What I don't understand is why so many people are so eager to be aggressors. I mean, look at all the facts and avoid war at all costs, right? Even lower- and middle-class people get behind these aggressive ideas (people who have absolutely nothing to gain from war). It's disheartening. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I keep seeing "illegal is illegal" and "they have to follow the law just like everyone else" as rebuttals to sympathizers of illegal immigrants. That's nonsense. Maybe the problem *IS* the law. Slavery was once legal, soooo

Not to mention the fact that many immigrants are just trying to survive and we have all these right-wing assholes obsessed with deportation and protecting the Mexican border (also nonsense).

Only argument I can maybe understand is that illegal immigration facilitates more criminal activity? By allowing criminals into the country? I think "it hurts our economy" is also another argument, but how? On the grand scale, how?

Someone please explain the mindset to me. </TEXT>

It's strange. I have anxieties about swimming and have to really force myself to go in. I'm 30 now, and apparently my grandmother accidentally dropped me in a tub when I was a baby (2-3?).

<TEXT> I just watched a documentary on Stress. Baboons, after being observed for 30+ years, went from being a serious, violent hierarchical group to being a communal group with little violence after the highest males were killed off by disease. And this continued for generations and was resilient to change because every time an unfamiliar male baboon came into the group and tried to dominate things, the group basically neutralized him and he became part of the commune.

I guess what I'm trying to say is, let's remove (that is, strip them of position) all the most powerful people in our society and watch the world flourish. </TEXT>

<TEXT> About a month ago I was getting ready for bed at my girlfriend's apartment when I heard her two cats making those weird purring/hunting noises in the kitchen. I was like "Oh shit, there's a mouse." My girlfriend was in her room, so I wandered into the kitchen to subtly investigate. Sure enough they had a small rodent trapped in a corner of the kitchen under an end-table. I kind of just hung out for 5 minutes until they flushed it out. One of them grabbed it in his mouth and before I could react, he shot over to the g/f's room and dropped it on the floor just outside her open door. The SECOND she looked up and saw the cat she knew what had happened (neither of us knowing if the tiny rodent was alive or dead) and screamed, "Ugghhaaahh what does he have?? What does he have??? Get it!!! Please!!" I was laughing so hard at her reaction that I kind of paused then realized, oh crap it might be alive and run into her room. But it wasn't, sadly. I stepped on the poor little mouse to make her feel better but be assured, the kitty had already killed it. </TEXT>
