I even asked my wife this evening (after taking kids home to the dirty house and going back to work for the second part of my day) what she did all day.  "I dunno--hung out.  Why?"  I replied, "I dunno... just thought you'd clean up some or something..."  I got no reply. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My wife of 5.5 years and I have a 15yo (step-daughter), 4yo son, and 3yo daughter. I work long hours on weekdays: in by 7:30AM, home by 9:00PM or later. I come home, and there is crap everywhere. It builds and builds until the weekend comes.

I can't relax in a messy house. Dishes (sometimes still with food) in sink, trash all over counters, toys everywhere, etc. I end up cleaning on the weekends because I can't stand it. I make the kids clean their crap (whining about how much it is), ask my wife to help (as she's playing Candy-effing-Crush or Face-effing-book) clean.

Why can't they just clean up their own crap? I spend time cleaning up a house that had literally NO messes made by me. I tried the don't-do-anything-until-they-do-it-themselves trick. That backfired miserably. I had TWO weeks of crap to do.

Case in point: my wife stayed home today with the 15yo who is recovering from a tonsillectomy. I brought the 3yo and 4yo to a sitter. I had hoped she would've cleaned the house, done laundry, done frickin' SOMEthing. NOPE. It eas even MORE messy than when I left this morning. What the hell can I do?

tl;dr - Wife and kids are lazy as hell; they won't clean up; husband/dad does everything after working 14+ work days all week. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depends on quantity and type of troops available.

Personally, I'd use heavies and zookas.  I'd drop 2-3 artillery on the launcher; drop a barrage or two on the boom; then utilize shocks while my heavies/zookas attacked everything. </TEXT>

I know it was renewed after episode 1, but that can be changed if ratings don't keep up.

Don't get your hopes up for this show.  I've watched all the episodes so far, and I don't feel a connection to ANY of the characters--much less Elliot. </TEXT>

Having homosexual urges == not a sin.

Acting on homosexual urges == a sin (i.e., adultery).

If Catholics accept homosexual marriage, it would no longer be considered adultery, and therefore would no longer be a sin.  This, in essence, would be changing church dogma.  How are any Catholics for same-sex marriage? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Former Papa John's driver here.

I knocked on an apartment door, and when it opened, the smell of weed wafted out.  Some skanky-looking blonde says, "Hey--come on in."  "Uhhhh....," I replied, "...okay...".

They had porn playing on the TV, and not only were the visuals distracting, but the incessant moaning of the woman on the screen.

They said to set the pizza down on the coffee table.  I went to do so, and realized that I had to miss the lines of cocaine they had ready to go.

She hands a wallet to a guy sitting there, and he hands me cash.  With a wink he said, "A little something extra for being such a nice guy."  I walked back to my car shaking my head, and expecting a nice tip.  After taking out the price of the pizza, it was a whopping $3.05 tip.

I should've called the cops on the cheap bastards.  HAHA! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Birth Control vs Health </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Our 15yo daughter has had extremely sporadic and random periods.  The GYN prescribed her some birth control to take for 3-4 months to help regulate it.

Knowing the church's stance on birth control for it's contraceptive purpose, how does it feel if being used to treat a medical issue (e.g., regulate periods)?

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's the same where I live (in Baton Rouge, Louisiana). You aren't alone.

And I hate it when after making a generalized statement, people immediately come back and say "not all of them are....".  Yeah--no crap, there isn't a single thing in the world that is 100% the same across the board.

/u/promisejustcurious is simply stating that in the are where they work, black people seem to be disrespectful of people's time, money, and service.   </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Has she always been a lazy kid - who doesn't see any reason to put in more than minimal effort?

Yes.

 Are you (as parents) or her siblings high acheivers? Is there pressure to be an achiever? is she rebelling against pressure or expectations that either she doesn't want or feels she can't meet?

We just expect her to do her work, and show actual effort in her studies.  That is lacking.

 Have you had her tested for a learning disability? Do you see times when she is absolutely able to do well if she applies herself?

She was tested for ADD/ADHD, and the test shown borderline minimal results.  Those times are few and far between.

 Is her personality counter to school culture - is she a free spirited, creative kid who doesn't like too much structure or being put in a box? Is she more hands on ?

She is very hands-on.

 What are her talents, hobbies, interests? When do you see her really engage in something? What does she enjoy? Where does she put effort?

She doesn't really have any REAL hobbies that she gets truly engaged into... unless texting/video-chatting on her friggin' phone is considered a hobby.

 Does she see any connection between school and her life? Any ideas what she wants to do after high school? Any older kids who she knows that have gone on to college?

She says she does. Says she wants to go to college. Apparently is now interested in photography (since she shows no signs of taking photos).  She has an older cousin attending LSU right now.

 Is she engaged at school outside of academics? Strong circle of friends? gets along with teachers? Involved in clubs, sports, teams or other school related extracurriculars?

She has had her extracurricular activities taken away as punishment for grades.  She has only one REAL friend...

 How is she mood wise? Lots of teen angst? Any signs of depression? Does she want to e Goth or emo or non mainstream in her self-expression?

Aside from treating me like a stereotypical step-daughter treats her step-father; no. </TEXT>

Her teachers view the students as being to be responsible by this age (which they should), and will sort of help with large assignments if asked, but not day-to-day homework. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Poor Grades vs. Tuition </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-21 19:01:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Scenario: 15yo daughter just completed her freshman year at a private, Catholic school costing $8k a year.  Showed little to no initiative in schoolwork, constantly got zeroes on homework, poor grades on tests, let to failing one class and barely getting C's and D's in others.

Tuition is going up to $8.5k next year, and I argue for taking her out of the school since it's practically a waste of money. 

My wife argues to keep her in because it's a better education than the public schools in East Baton Rouge (Louisiana) Parish.

I counter-argue that it's not a better education if she's not getting anything from it anyway because she simply doesn't care, and constantly complains about how hard it is.

___________________
What is the better solution?

HELP!

*Edit: Thanks for all the comments.  This is an issue we've been struggling with for a few years.  Any time we try to determine why, all we get is either, "I don't know," or, "It's just how I am."*

1. /u/SteveHarveysSuit -- I'm not sure we know exactly what she'd want.  She's all about social, so I'd be willing to bet she'd pick staying just to not have to make friends all over again.

2.  /u/NovelTeach and /u/dmf95742 -- She makes no money to pay for anything.  That would require a job.  We tried the F = -$10; D = -$5; C = $0; B = +$5; and A = +$10 for report cards, but when the negatives outweigh the positives, it became pointless.

3. /u/flakemasterflake -- She doesn't seem to care about peer pressure... at least academically. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It sounds like you rushed into RCIA before you were ready. I was raised Assemblies of God.  I attended Catholic mass for two years before going through RCIA.  

I spoke to many Catholics about many things. You need to find a few solid Catholics, and just talk with them a while.  We all go through it.

I too struggled with masturbation. Not so much a problem now that I'm married. Hehe.  That one is tough.  I'd suggest /r/NoFap for support on that one.

Talk to priest or deacon you trust. Get counseling sessions set up.  I'm sure they'd work with you.

Side-Note: I believe that homosexuality itself is not a sin. Acting on the sexual urges, and therefore committing fornication/adultery, is the sin. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Flat tax on purchased goods ***only***.

Someone making $30k a year might spend $200-$300 month on food.  9% tax on that is only $27.  They might buy a $5k used car.  9% tax on that is $450.

Someone making $100k a year might spend $1200 a month on food.  9% tax on that is $108.  They might buy an $85k new car.  9% tax on that is $7,650!

tl;dr :: Rich people buy more (and more expensive) things than poor people.  It's fair.

I work as an electrical designer (under an engineer) and we do commercial design work for architects. We deal with several disciplines. The mechanical subs appear to always get their units and spec data directly from a manufacturer instead of doing it themselves.

Not to mention they get us the electrical data the day before the job is due. HVAC is a HUGE percentage of electrical load. We do most of the actual engineering right at the end. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If one dresses, speaks, and acts a certain way, they are labeled as such in my mind.

In my city (Baton Rouge, LA; but New Orleans is worse), GENERALLY SPEAKING, blacks are lazy, low-work-ethic, governmental-freeloaders who do nothing but leech off the system while not contributing.  If they DO get jobs, they're on their damn cellphones or talking to each other rather than assisting the customers.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We have a new priest this year, and he uses incence.  I am a convert, and have never dealt with it.

After blessing the consecration, he turns to the congregation, bows, blesses each side, and bows again.

My question: Do I bow the first time; as he blesses me; or the last bow?  Do I make the sign of the cross?  Do I do nothing?

I'm so confused, and it appears the majority of the congregation is as well based upon their responses.  Haha! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm gonna assume you mean:
 "I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. You cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udn. Go back to the Shadow! You cannot pass."

Gandalf is making three very specific references as both warning and challenge to the Balrog. by identifying himself as a servant of the secret fire (or Flame impersishable), Gandalf is identifying himself as a Maiar, an embodied angelic servant of the Valar protecting the light of Creation that Eru Iluvatar (or God) has set to burn at the centre of Arda (Earth).

Wieldor of the flame of Anor is a reference to his ability to draw on the power of the sun possibly through the Ring of Fire Narya but maybe also through his own divine origins.

Finally as he refers to the Balrog as the Flame of Udun, he informs the Balrog that he knows it to be a corrupted Maiar in the service of Morgoth from the earliest time when he resided as Melkor in his dark fortress of Utumno broken by the Valar at the awakening of the Elves. He orders it to retreat (go back to the shadows) or face the consequences of divine conflict and final judgement before the Valar Mandos the fate of all slain creatures. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not really, what I want and what Republicans want aren't always synonymous.

Examples:

1. Legalize friggin' marijuana already.
2. Let anyone get married at any institution that will perform the ceremony.
3. Pull all troops from any foreign country; let them protect OUR boarders, not other countries' boarders.
4. No more foreign aid until we no longer have national debt.
5. Disband the IRS, and enforce a flat tax.  It's fair.  Poor people buy cheaper things; rich people buy more expensive things.  It's fair; quit whining.
6. etc... </TEXT>

<TEXT> To paraphrase Ronald Regan:

I didnt leave the Republican party, the Republican Party left me.

Don't get me wrong, I can't STAND Democrats, but I've slowly started hating Republicans more and more since I turned 18 back in 1999.  They're all talk, and no action.  The "Republican" candidates that do get into office are so middle-of-the-road, that nothing happens.

I think I will now consider myself a Conservative Libertarian.  Screw the (D)/(R) parties.  I'm sick of this crap. </TEXT>

_________________________

I first heard this quote in the intro to DC Talk's "What If I Stumble?" back in 1995 when I was 14 years old.  I got it then, but it means so much more to me now that I'm coming up on 34.

I strive to be a good example for others, but more specifically for my children.  I try to keep this quote in mind.  Thought I'd share it in case others haven't heard it before. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, there was one moment that made my jaw drop at the utter stupidity of the scientists.

Miller's Planet... massive time dilation. The team went down to get the information.  Notice the massive waves.  Brand gets the idea in her head to go get data and gets stuck.  CASE is commanded to get her.  He suddenly transforms into SUPER-SPEED MODE!  

My jaw dropped in the theater.  I turned to my wife, and whispered, "What the HELL?!"

Why didn't they just send CASE down?  He could pilot the lander; he could go into super-speed mode; make assessments; get the data; come back; and it wouldn't have been 28 years lost.  Maybe half that.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> My Issue With Confession </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-18 08:22:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was raised in the Assemblies of God church.  My mother is still a registered AG pastor, in fact.  Come 16 years ago, my parents divorced, and I backslid.  I met my wife 13 years ago, and she and her family are very Catholic.

I converted through RCIA, and received all the sacraments at the Easter Vigil Mass in 2003.  The one thing I have never agreed with, and have not participated with is confession.

Why should we go through a mediary, like a priest, when we can go strait to God, and ask for forgiveness?  Didn't make sense then, and it doesn't make sense now.
