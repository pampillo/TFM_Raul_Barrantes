<TEXT> That's exactly it. Thank of a single spot in space the the longboarder passes through every time they complete a circuit.

Now think of how much time the camera sees the longboarder versus the background. Clearly, the background is what is seen for a majority of the time. Since there's no extra light in the longboarder vs the background, the background is what shows up in the final picture!

You could do many things to change what shows up and get various results and degrees of "transparency" for the boarder dude/dudette  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My friend had a stress fracture, and after six weeks, she was fine. Assuming yours is similar and not much more serious, It's just rest that you need. Once you get back to running, you'll start off slower of course, but you'll be back to your original form in a few weeks.

The important thing is to listen to your feet once the cast comes off, and not push it. Two years later, the few weeks you lose won't matter. But you'll regret it terribly if you push yourself and cause a more serious injury. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm attending a friend's wedding in Switzerland and I then plan to hike along the via alpina from Geneva to Nice (about 550 km). Does anyone know the scene in terms of camping along there?

From what I read, there are a lot of huts. But are there enough that I won't need to take a tent along at all? What about a stove? 

Any other hints and tips would be greatly appreciated! </TEXT>

The study says this too, though:

 Westerners with a Christian background also became more tolerant after being exposed to Buddhist concepts, though only among those with a predisposition for valuing the welfare of all people and an aversion towards authoritarianism

I wonder what they mean by by that...that only those with a predisposition for valuing the welfare of all people had their prejudices reduces? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This doesn't really show that one is more true than the other: Buddhist concepts reduce prejudice, or that the people who choose buddhism are less prejudiced already. 

On other hand: in India, Buddhism rose as a response to the caste system, i.e. to reduce prejudice that was at the time, extremely inherent to Hinduism.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> How do you guys know when a camera is right for you? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-29 17:49:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When I was in grad school, I had no money and my brother gifted me a D40. I loved that thing and took thousands of pictures over 5 years.

Now I'm a little better off financially and am looking for a camera...I thought having more options would lead to a much better choice, but I've now bought and returned/resold the following cameras (and corresponding lenses at times):

EPL3 - NEX6 - D5300 - D7000

I haven't felt the same magic or freedom I felt with the D40. In fact, I'm beginning to feel like I'm setting myself up for disappointment in always looking for a better camera, but on the other hand, every camera feels like I'm settling.

Do any of you feel the same about your gear? Any advice?

EDIT: Thanks for all your responses, guys. Getting out there and shooting is the important part. I get that, but I really have to train myself not to think of the gear. It was easy when I couldn't afford better when it was forced upon me that I couldn't have better gear. Photography really is an emotional thing for me, and I really want it to stay that way :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think there's an India Coffee House in Bangalore too...somewhere near MG road.

I can give you directions to the shop where my dad buys his coffee...maybe you'll like it:

Go to Gandhi Bazaar (Uber if you don't know how to get there) and ask someone for directions to "Srinivas Coffee Roasters". You can walk there from wherever you get off the cab. It's just like I described -- small place with one guy. It really doesn't look anything like anything you would find in Forum mall. I just looked for it and there certainly wasn't a website. You might encounter broken english :) While there, eat the masala dosa at Vidhyarthi Bhavan -- it's awesome. Actually...eat the spicy masala dosa there and then have a cup of coffee! I do that at least once on every trip back home. Sorry...got a bit carried away!

Also buy the Indian coffee filter and learn to use it if you don't know how already. Have it Indian style w/ hot/steamed milk (but no/less sugar) and see how you like it :) 

If you want, you can PM me, and I'll give you more details!

<TEXT> There are lots of shops that sell beans. India has a very strong coffee culture, but it's not well advertised like here, and the culture (as it existed before) is very different. The shops are really small (source: I'm from Bangalore). The shops aren't fancy, or anything. They're just a guy and lots of beans and big burr grinder if you want them ground. My dad was telling me that when he was a kid, they would buy green coffee beans, go get them roasted at a roaster and then come back home and grind them by hand at home. 

The fact that Indian coffee is milk and sugar doesn't make it automatically bad. In my house in India, the stuff we get out of our coffee filter is so thick that you have to add milk. The milk is part of the flavor, and not there to hide it. It's just a different way of making coffee. Plus we don't add sugar at home. It's also drunk in small amounts at once, but lots of times. If you visit south Indian homes, you'll see that the first thing they offer you is coffee. Conversations happen over coffee in every house. 

I use an Aeropress and Hario mill and Stumptown at home here in Seattle, but when I visit home, I really don't feel like I'm having inferior coffee when I drink the super-strong 4 oz cups of filtered freshly ground coffee and milk.

What India does not have is a strong CAFE culture. The cafes (so far) have really bad coffee, that I can agree. Cafe Coffee Day, Costa Coffee...all of them sucked when I tried them. 

Plus, they're all aping the espresso-latte trend instead of showing off India's own culture. This is not in itself a bad thing. I do hope Starbucks helps Indian cafes bring up their latte game.

EDIT: I just realized -- North India is, indeed like you say, predominantly tea country. I'm from the South, so results may vary. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Doesn't this paper assume that there _is_ in fact, condemnation of the Zors' treatment of the Aree?

It seems the moral "consistency" becomes subjective. If you condemn the treatment and are still non-vegan, you are being inconsistent

If you don't condemn the treatment (food chain, tastes good, law of land, mighty wins) and you're non vegan, consistency is maintained.

<TEXT> There's actually a few things to consider:

1. Timeline: Most companies that release "crippled" products do so because of deadlines and timelines, not because of increased customer satisfaction along the way.
2. Competition: I think this is an extremely important factor, especially in cars. If a company releases a detuned/undertuned car, a different company will release a better performing car for the same price. Car 1 will be reviewed badly, and sell badly. 

On the other hand, if companies *could* get away with it, they absolutely would. Intel comes to mind, as mentioned in some of the other comments

Edit: Ethics aren't important at all. An ethical company tries to make customers happy WHILE maximizing profits AND staying ahead of the competition in at least one factor of their product/design </TEXT>

I thought I'd clawed my way out of it.

Today, I went on a date. The date actually went well. 

But...I came back home and cried. Me...a 31 year old male. I don't know why I'm crying.

The scariest thing is that I thought I had close friends. Then I thought of who I could talk to right now about the fact that I'm dying here, and there was no one. Not family, not friends.

I've gone into a shell after the last few months and I can't come out. I don't know what to do. I'm lost... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Drag files here or just start typing. Imagine those poor files, being dragged everywhere, against their will.

But then, it isnt really against their will, is it?

People are rioting in Missouri and here I sit on my bed in the bedroom me a sort of conservative Indian guy on the bed in the bedroom sort of high and sort of drunk and that couchsurfing lady is in the living room just about five minutes away from snoring and weve just seen Guardians of the Galaxy and people are rioting in Missouri and a sort of innocent kid died and a sort of guilty cop now is free except hes sort of not a cop any more but all the punctuations gone away but the feelings stay and I feel sort of sad for all the kids that die but Im so far way that I dont really understand and there I can see the punctuation coming back.

Heartbreak doesnt make a sound, though Im sure there have been poems written about it. Maybe its the sound of silence shattering in slow motion. Is the sound of my heart breaking here louder than the sound of glass and guns and riots and rage in Missouri? Is my sorrow greater than their anger? It is not greater, but I cant help that it is a shallow pond that is getting me wet, as many roaring waterfalls plummet with the force of a million voices elsewhere.

I wish all the grammar and all the structure would leave, not needed by either me the writer or you the reader, and we would communicate with pure meaning. Who knows what is lost between my mind and the keys and and all the electricity and your screen and your eyes and your brain. Do we really know each other?

I think I know the sound that heartbreak makes. Every heart makes a different sound. Even the same heart sounds different at different times. Sometimes its a glass of whiskey, shattering against the wall. Sometimes its a fist punching a wall again and again and again and again till the sound is softened by swelling. Sometimes, its the silence of tears. Sometimes its the joy of freedom. There is no certainty and certainly no consistency. 

People are shooting at police. Police are shooting at people. Police are people. How does it get to this? 

My day today wasnt bad. My head is aching a bit. Its a bit heavy and Im high and low. High and low. I was laughing at the movie, now Im saddened by Missouri. And Israel. And immigration. I wish everyone found peace, you know. Not the peace of war and peace. But the peace of a light heart. The peace of a satisfactory silence. The peace of a broken heart hopefully picking up its own pieces and patching itself back together. Everyone should be at peace.

I remember Kalalau. I remember those people living there on the beach. They were at peace. But their peace was born of ignorance. Could peace come with knowledge? Could there be peace in misery? 

The silence fills my ears and I can feel my eyes closing. I yawn bigly. Ill be asleep soon, while the world burns in a hundred thousand places. While fifty thousand people have bad sex and fifty thousand people have good sex, and fifty thousand people sleep in their bed with no one to hug.

I think you find what you look for in the world. Forrest Gump, he had it wrong. You get the chocolates you pick out, and the chocolates you pick from that big box of life chocolates, it isnt chosen by you. Your choice is but the interface to a million little events and books and scoldings and experiences that lift your arms, open your fingers, reach for that chocolate that is either joy or sorrow or anger or lust or sloth or video games or mountains or god or God or NoGod or MaybeGod or love or hate or regret or joy and it all those things in the past and present that guide you into the future where you become one or not or die or live or do something or nothing but even nothing is something. Maybe its because Im high that the full-stop runs away from me and my thoughts have to run really hard to catch up but because theyre running and stumbling, nothing is clear and everything is a mess of words on the page like the villains head after its smashed in with a hammer.

Except, I dont know my thoughts and I dont know what a smashed-in head looks like. Except in the movies.

Guardians of the Galaxy: Good movie.
Sad news is sad, but there is hope.
Some people will live and every one will die.

Good night. </TEXT>

1. No biking directions, which is okay, because I can bike where i can walk
2. No Google Now integration. This is the thing that breaks it for me. My most common use case for maps is talking to my phone and telling it to navigate to home, or a restaurant. I wish Google gave us the option/API to use Here Maps as the default. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm just tired. Today, as I was driving my car, I was by the lake and just wanted to drive in it. I have no clue why I didn't. Maybe I'm a coward.

There are people who love me, I don't know why. Maybe because they've never seen me at my lowest, or even low. 

Suicide sounds so peaceful, for me at least. And if there's one thing I'm certain of, it's that it's only my pain that I'm feeling now. But even as I'm thinking of killing myself, I know I won't do it. I just like to dwell for a bit in the thought of a final peace.

I can go rest my face on the grill to distract myself, or cut off one finger. But I won't do that either, and I don't know why. Maybe I don't want my family to go through all that drama. Maybe I don't want to disappoint them. But then, am I really giving them joy if it's all a lie and I curl up into my blanket and cry the night away as soon as I turn around?

I don't know. I read the posts on here a lot. You guys are brave, both the ones that find a reason to live on and the ones that don't. I feel like a coward...just hanging on to a rope of nothing because I don't know to do anything else. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was glissading about 3 weeks back and injured my lower back. So now, for the last two weeks, my back has been hurting a decent amount. Not too much - I can walk and talk and work and be happy without having to cry out loud.

However, I decided to take some time off running to rest while I recover. The problem is, it's been 3 weeks and I still haven't recovered fully...and I really want to get back to running! All the trails must be so lonely without me.

I'm 30 now, and my body isn't what it used to be at 22 :) So I ask, is it okay to run with lower back pain, or should I wait it out a bit more?

<DATE> 2014-08-12 17:17:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is an emotional rant more than anything else...feel free to ignore.

I saw all these reviews saying the NEX-6 took amazing photos...and maybe it does. 

I came to the NEX-6 from a Nikon D40 with an Olympus E-PL3 in between. I was determined to reduce the size of my camera bag.

At first the E-PL3 just felt wrong, and now the NEX-6 just feels wrong. The Nikon D40 somehow just felt...real. 

Maybe it was the viewfinder? The NEX-6 has an EVF, but it's not really much better than seeing it on the LCD. Maybe I'm just technologically backward? 

I don't know...Maybe I just need time to get used to it? Anyone else have a similar experience?

EDIT: Wow..I was off reddit for a day...thanks for all the responses! I'll give it more time and if it doesn't work, with upgrade to a nice DSLR....maybe even go all the way to full frame..My backpacking bag won't be happy, but maybe I will!

<TEXT> I've been using a Hario Mill Skerton + Aeropress for the last year, and I've been quite happy with it. However, I drink only a cup or two a day at home.

My dad is visiting and he drinks a lot of coffee. I bought a larger french press for him, and now I'm thinking of getting an electric burr grinder so he doesn't have to grind by hand all the time. 

What's the difference between a $35 one (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004T6EJS0) and the Baratza Encore that I see recommended on here over and over. Is the Encore really worth all that much more, assuming I won't be using either for anything other than the Aeropress or the french press?

EDIT: You guys convinced me thoroughly. I bought the Encore. My dad will probably be mad to see me spending $130 on "just a thing to grind coffee"...but Oh well...the taste of the coffee better be worth it :) </TEXT>

I'm in agreement with all of your rules, except for keeping tabs on my shoes. But only because I've never done that. I will keep all of this in mind. We have very similar running philosophies :)

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> What's a good training program to get to 50 miles? My most recent trail run was a 20 mile trail run (Peterson ridge).

I have very good endurance (well...relative to my peers, I guess). The 20 miles didn't tire me too badly, but my feet were hurting quite a bit. So, I guess I should have increased distance in a more planned manner, rather than jumping into it like I did. 

What kind of training program should I follow? The simpler, the better...I like my runs to be peaceful. Pain is okay, but I don't want to be constantly monitoring my heart rate and so on...Ideally, the program would get me to 50 miles in 9-10 months of enjoyably torturous running, even if a bit inefficiently. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Today at work, I was doing fine till the afternoon when I messaged her.

I knew it was over. I could feel it. Today, the depression would hit me. It had been a few months. No. Almost a year. But I could see the snowflake falling in my head. I could see its trajectory, and I could see the avalanche that it would cause.

I had to be really careful. I'd escaped before. I just had to keep focused on work. Fuck. Why wasn't she replying? 

*Those are the kind of thoughts that will lead you down the path. Focus on the work. Get the job done*

Had she replied? I checked my phone and got a beer. Maybe the beer would help. I drank it quickly. Nope. Bad idea.

I needed to get out of there. I decided to walk home, but then saw the bus and got on instead. 

When i got off the bus, I felt afraid of the evening that lay ahead. It was less than a block that I had to walk. Each step increased my dread. I'd never, ever felt this before. I knew that I would go home and burst into tears. Nothing would stop it now. Except if I didn't go home.

Yes, that was it. I just had to take a walk. The thought was there, but I kept moving towards my house. I felt like I was a chained by my hands and was being dragged along the floor. I helplessly watched my legs carry me up the stairs. 

I methodically checked my mail, unlocked the door, put my keys and badge in their place, locked the door, took off my shoes, went into my bedroom, covered myself with my blanket and burst into tears. They flowed peacefully and silently, accompanied only by the sound of my refrigerator humming. I should have gotten that fixed long back.

I stopped crying, got up and decided to write this.

The rest of the evening beckons, and I have to go. Thank you for reading. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys..I'm developing an app for Android that can play local media (just for learning) and I was wondering how the battery usage of apps is commonly tested. How do you guys test the battery usage of your app? 

Like, if I wanted a script that would launch a video for an hour and see how my app is doing...what would I need to know to write such a script?

Also, I've been told that battery percentage isn't really an accurate descriptor of the battery usage...why is that? Is it because it drops due to every other app and Wifi and data usage and all that? If not battery percentage, what would I be using to see how my app eats up the battery? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys,

I spent a bunch of the last 3-4 years in a depressed state, but told very few people, and now I'm on one of the upswings. But this isn't about me..

Recently, a very close friend of mine was diagnosed with depression due to Iron deficiency in her diet. The feelings she talked about briefly, I understand only too well...and of course, I want to help

But the problem is, I remember when I was feeling similar things, I really, REALLY didn't want help from other people...I could hardly bear talking to anyone else...and I think she's the same...since she's been hardly talking the last few weeks...I've tried to let her know that I'm there for her if she wants to talk...and I've tried to make conversation normally as well..but I really want to get through to her...that she's not alone in this.

I just don't know how...especially since I can remember a time when no one could get through to me..

Any ideas?

<TEXT> Not really. The India Pakistan split was a complicated issue. In fact, India has more Muslims than Pakistan. Our previous president was muslim as well.

Not that doesn't mean India is completely secular. Narendra Modi in particular and his party in general are known to be communal. He is widely thought to have had a hand in major communal riots in 2002 where a lot of Muslims were killed. But again, been that is a gray area.

<TEXT> If you're prepared to add a day or two to your trip, you can go camp out in the Whitney area and look for permits every day. A lot of people apply for the lottery and cancel/never show up/show up in smaller groups than planned.

A ranger told me he's always had a few walk-in permits issues...every  day when the visitor center opens. Just go for it! 

Also, you can climb one of the "lesser" mountains. 

I had way more fun on Mt. Dade than on Mt. Whitney. Even though I didn't even reach the top of Dade. Whitney was so much easier, crowded and less fun overall. Though the views are great. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A friend and I are planning on a 9 day trip to Kauai in the end of May, and we want to spend 3-4 days backpacking. We love mountains and beaches and rivers...basically everything.

Any suggestions for trails that we can do? Preferably not crowded!

Also, do kayak agencies rent kayaks by the hour/day for ocean kayaking? Everything I found online only had guided tours. Any suggestions would be welcome. Thank you! </TEXT>

The only reason for Logician 1 (and 2) to say "I don't know" to the bartender's question is that he/she wants a beer, but doesn't know about the other two. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had long heard rumors about the Fade on OKCupid, but could never have guessed that my own self would experience the phenomenon. They had said that one day, communication would cease. Abruptly. Leaving thoughts and words and plans hanging in the air. Even dreams, if you're romantically inclined. 

It was everything that had been said, and more. It was a fleeting glimpse of a better place. Before I could make out any details of this magical kingdom, it was replaced by the familiar grayness of our cloudy, daily existence. I could no longer deny the existence of the Fade. I could only move on. 

It reminded me of knights in medieval times. A beautiful lady drops a handkerchief on the road and smiles at a knight. He smiles back, dismounts from his steed and picks it up. He runs up the old (perhaps new, in the time of the knight) staircase to the balcony, but there's no one there. "Was it all a dream?", he wonders. He looks at his hand, and the question is answered. For the handkerchief is still there.

Second post: How do I handle dates?  
Third post (this one): What do I do after my first date?

It seems like I'm growing with this sub!

I had two OKC dates last week (I am 29/M), but this is really the first time I've been actually dating. Everything before came out of already-existing friendships.

The dates went okay. We talked a lot, laughed a decent amount and went home feeling warmish inside (well me, at least).

Now I'm texting back and forth, but it seems like I'm going nowhere with this. It's all "what are you up to?" and "hahaha that was hilarious". How do I make my interest clear? Or do I wait for a second date? 

No idea what to do. Please to help, the experienced peoples of the Reddit!

EDIT: Had both genders listed for myself. I'm only one -- male. </TEXT>

It's not like I have dates lined up or anything. My OKC ritual usually goes like this: I get 1/10 replies. After a thread lasting about 6 messages, she stops replying.

But in theory, suppose I had to choose between two (or more..it's theory!) girls after date(s) with both of them. Is this acceptable (just saying No to one of them)...in the OKC culture?

I'm sure girls face this issue quite a bit on OKC...since all the guys are green, and all the girls are red :D </TEXT>

I found this: http://www.physics.princeton.edu/~mcdonald/examples/bernoulli.pdf

So the car pressure is *higher* than outside, and net-airflow is actually **outwards**! Of course, because there's air coming in through the vents. Cool stuff.

Also, a hole in the windshield is the "same" as a window, because air is flowing attached to the car surface and not straight into the car. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually air flows out of the bottle, not into it. Also imagine an aeroplane door cracking open in midflight. Everything flows out, not in. The air outside is moving relative to the car, so actually the air outside is the air with the lower pressure. Just like in a wind tunnel.

Barometric equilibrium is of course true. But how? Why...what if you open the window just a tiny bit? Is air still flowing both in and out of there? Because sure as hell, if you put your hands in the gap, you're going to feel air flowing in.

EDIT: In fact, what happens if all your windows are closed and there's a (say big) hole in the front windshield? Where's the air flowing out of then? I think there's some big thing I'm missing...and it's not just that air is flowing out of an undefined place. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Relative to the car, the air inside the car is at rest, right? So it's pressure 
is the same as when it started, which is atmospheric pressure.

So you mean, part of the window has inflowing air and part of it has outflowing air? Which parts have inflow and which have outflow? Like I said, try this in a moving car...you really can't find a region with outflowing air.

Also, if the pressure inside is *actually* lower, why is air flowing out?

<TEXT> I was asked this puzzle a few weeks back and couldn't figure it out.

You're moving in a car, and you roll down the windows. Air flows into the car. 

1. Why does air flow in? Air inside is at atmospheric pressure, air outside is at atmospheric pressure. Pressure being equal, there should be no flow.

2. Obviously it's flowing out from somewhere, otherwise pressure would build up in the car and it would explode. Where does it go out of? This was asked to me when inside a moving car, and I placed my hand at various locations around the window and air seemed to be coming inside everywhere!

<TEXT> We don't really consider molecules while talking about the propagation of sound. The assumption is that they collide frequently enough with each other that statistically speaking, the pressure distribution is continuous. That's what the continuum assumption means. 

Increasing amplitude of (pressure) oscillations is the same as increasing the loudness of the sound, so yes...It would work in relation to your ear. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Theoretically, the speed of sound is a function of $\gamma$, $P$ (pressure) and $\rho$ (density)... 

Basically, as the density approaches zero, the speed of sound becomes undefined, i.e. there's no air for the sound to travel through. Theoretically though, however rarefied the air is, sound can still travel.

However, when I say theoretically, I mean in the theory of compressible flow, which assumes that air is a continuum. This assumption is valid for quite a while.

At the point where air cannot be treated as a continuum and molecules are too far to collide with each other (but still close enough for non-zero density), sound can't travel. When there is zero pressure, the speed of sound is zero.

However, whether you can *hear* sound in these cases is a completely different question, because that depends on whether your ear drum can detect the pressure variations and oscillations.

**tl;dr**: Pressure goes to zero, sound can't travel. Density goes to zero, nothing for sound to travel in. Molecular and/or viscous effects can/may do other things that I don't know (but hopefully someone does!)

<TEXT> I'm sure the African people have their own systems of counting and learning. Just because it's different from western theory doesn't mean it's magical. The africans work just as hard and take just as much time to learn their rhythms. And they have their own version of "polyrhythms" and theory as well.

I kind of relate to it since Indian music is similar. Polyrhythms start very, very early when learning indian percussion and are never really regarded with the same sort of amazement as they are in western music. Really cool stuff. 

Also, Bela Fleck is awesome :) </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have DTExpress IV, that I've used lovingly (as lovingly as drummers can, I guess). 

Everything works perfectly. The module is still doing its job impeccably and you can upgrade all the pads and use the same module. At least, when I bought the drumkit, it was the same module across kits.

This is the kit: http://www.amazon.com/Yamaha-DTXPRESS-Special-Electronic-Drum/dp/B000YK9XB8/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top

Except for the snare pad, which is not the mesh pad as shown in the figure, but just a normal pad with three zones.

The item is no longer manufactured by Yamaha, though I believe they are still using the module in their entry level kits.

PM me if interested. I can't ship this and don't have a car...but it can sort of fit into a reasonable trunk for short distances. With a truck, it's not a problem at all. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Setting up a workflow -- advice and tips needed! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-04-16 17:58:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been photographing stuff (mountains and people and leading lines and frames...) for about five years now, but haven't really been doing any processing. Mainly because I really liked the act of getting out in the world and taking pictures, but didn't really feel the need to do much else.

Because of my laziness, my photos now lie scattered across various hard disks, each representing a different era in terms of age, photographic maturity and file naming convention.

I want to set up a workflow now, because I'm starting to feel a need to get organized. I've decided to use Lightroom for this task, because as far as I can see, it has more than enough power to do all the processing I want to do, and also has enough strengths to force me to organize stuff.

I want to learn Lightroom properly. No shortcuts, no nothing. So what should I do? What are some common pitfalls I should look out for? What should I certainly NOT do?

Thanks a lot for any advice you can give me! </TEXT>

Our experience level would be equivalent to the first half of a basic mountaineering course, I guess. We know how to use ice axes and crampons and have used both on climbs before. I can handle ropes from some rock climbing experience, but I haven't used ropes on mountains.

The only reason I ask for Mt Rainier is that I don't really know what being a glacial mountain entails in terms of climbing...what would that be?

<TEXT> Gravity and centripetal force will act in different directions. Centripetal force acts towards the axis of rotation (in the same plane as the latitude at that point), while gravity acts towards the center of the earth. AT the poles, there is no rotation and hence no centripetal force.

The weight you measure of course, is the sum of all the forces acting towards the center of the earth, so the centripetal force is included in there. Yes, it does reduce your weight.

Not sure why I'm being downvoted, because I'm right. The direction of the forces is different. They're the same at the equator (where the axis passes through the center of the earth) and different at every other latitude. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The links only showcased promiscuity and prevalence of STDs, neither of which represent inefficiency or anti-social tendencies.

Also, the study was flawed not by misconduct, but by poor research practices. If you talk about effects of gay parenting on children, the parents at the very least, have to be gay, right?

EDIT: Also, the real assertion was that inefficiency and anti-social tendencies have something to do with marriage rights. 

So let's see: Gay people are anti-social. No. Gay people are inefficient. I suddenly realized I don't even know what inefficient means in this context. Unless you're talking about the fact that they can't have kids with both parents procreating with each other, that's a No too. 

Even if there were some fictional group of people who were anti-social and "inefficient", why wouldn't you want them to get married? Marriage will only help with anti-social tendencies and whatever inefficiencies are. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My code is running in the background, so I have some time and will explore each of these links.

Okay, done exploring. Overall, you seem to be saying that gay people are more promiscuous because of which they have a higher incidence of STDs, which is already well known, is it not? Is that the point you're trying to get across? How does this make them anti-social or inefficient, which is what the commenter above you asked? 

More importantly, what does that have to do with gay marriage? Anti-social and inefficient people can't marry the ones they love? 


This is the only relevant article you've posted...which I had to take from a different comment:

 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X12000610

The study seemed interesting and convincing. Till you realize that what the study treats as "children of gay parents" are actually not that at all. They are children of people who have had at least one homosexual relationship at ANY point in their life, even if they are now heterosexual and happily married to the love of their life, who is of the opposite sex. That is an extreme misrepresentation of what the study purports to say. More info here: http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/beyond-blood/201206/flawed-study-gay-parenting-roundup-recent-media-coverage-and-critiques

http://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/Newsroom/msmpressrelease.html[1]

This says that gay people have a higher incidence of HIV (isn't that well known and accepted already) and suggests that more prevention efforts need to be targeted at them. Very sensible and true. Not sure what that has to do with gay marriage, though. 

 http://www.cdc.gov/msmhealth/for-your-health.htm[2]

Again, HIV. What does this have to do with gay marriage? Many diseases (some just as serious has HIV) have large variations across various ethnic and minority and every other kind of groups. Not sure what that has to do with marriage rights.

http://chipts.ucla.edu/2012/05/29/a-comparison-of-sexual-behavior-patterns-among-men-who-have-sex-with-men-and-heterosexual-men-and-women/[3]

This one is again about HIV. In fact, it says: "MSM reported more consistent condom use during anal sex than was reported during vaginal sex by heterosexuals." 

While that means gay people are taking care of the HIV thing (and still have higher HIV incidence rates for a myriad of reasons), I still don't see what that has to do with marriage rights. 

 http://www.thebody.com/content/67321/a-comparison-of-sexual-behavior-patterns-among-men.html[4]

Dude! (Or Dudette). That has exactly the same text as the previous link. Come on!

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1876122/pdf/canmedaj01409-0056.pdf[5]

If you're trying to make the point that more healthcare efforts need to be targeted towards gay people, you're making an excellent point. I agree completely. But I still don't understand what that has to do with the issue here, which is gay marriage. Why are you using promiscuity as some yardstick for marriage rights? It doesn't make sense to me.

 http://factsaboutyouth.com/posts/promiscuity/[6]

Okay, first of all, enough with the promiscuity. Gay people have more sex. Good for them! Tell them to use condoms (or whatever it is that lesbians need to use). 

That site says "Reorientation therapy" has been shown to be effective. What the fuck, man? The American Association of Pediatrics said: "The document and website repeat distorted claims that sexual orientation and gender identity are changeable by reparative therapy and that if theyre not reinforced in youth, then their homosexuality and/or transgenderism will eventually go away." (http://www2.aap.org/featured/sexualorientation.htm)

www.cdc.gov/msmhealth/STD.htm[7]

Woah...Cool link. Thanks for telling me that there are diseases that can be transmitted via sex.

 http://lgbtdrugrehab.com/addiction-treatment-statistics[8]

That's a nice link.

Oh wow...wtf. That shit's scary and sad. Those people should get help! Is it only gay people that chase these bugs?

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaPODY7oPCA[11] (gay meth abuse documentary)
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ga%C3%ABtan_Dugas[12] (AIDS patient zero in North America)

So patient zero was gay...So....? It's not like he went around saying "Hey I have a disease...come get it!" 

 http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2012/08/10/cdc-has-new-plan-for-gonorrhea.html[13] (Homosexuals create a resistant strain of gonorrhea just as scientists are getting HIV under control)

That article actually says gay and bisexual people have increased *resistance* toward gonorrhea and the incidence is reducing in the West of the US. Not sure what you're trying to say.

Okay, back to coding.

**tl;dr**: Good to know you're an atheist. Good to know (I mean in the way that more knowledge is good) that there is a higher incidence of STDs among gay people and more health efforts need to be targeted towards them. Good to know that drug rehabilitation centers are able to target efforts to them as well. None of this however, makes gay people anti-social or inefficient. And the only link that talked about gay marriage didn't talk about gay marriage.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I went to undergrad in India. And my college used to host an intercollegiate festival with various competitions. One of these was a fashion show, which was cancelled by the dean because of supposedly indecent exposure.

I was pissed. So I wrote an email, met him and tried to convince him for an hour...to no avail.

So my friend and I decided to take the air out of his scooter tires. We drove up there at night, but couldn't figure out which out of three his scooter was.

So instead, we went up all the way to the third floor to his house and stole his milk bag.

That was our fuck you to the system. One day without milk for the dean! </TEXT>

Once I was trying to impress my mum with my newly acquired cooking skills. She left for work with the promise of lentils when she came back. Well, the cooker "exploded". It was loud. The lid was around the cooker. But the lentils were everywhere. The ceiling (11 ft high), the walls of the kitchen. Some of them even made it to the adjacent rooms.

<TITLE> Advice on mirrorless (Micro 4/3rds) cameras </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-04-06 21:05:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've used  Nikon D40 for six years and I've always imagined that I'll be upgrading an SLR with better specs.

But this recent onslaught of mirrorless cameras with slightly smaller sensors has really got me intrigued. My main aim with photography is to take good pictures while hiking and backpacking. So these cameras seem to fit perfectly into what I want to do.

Does anyone have experience using them? What brands/models would you recommend? What are the numbers I should be looking out for? 

My budget is around $500. Megapixels don't matter and I don't have to have the newest model at all. So there are a lot of options from me from Nikon, Panasonic, Sony, Olympus... Any help?

<TEXT> For Algorithms, *The Algorithm Design Manual* by Skiena is incredible. It's written well and skimps a bit on rigor knowingly and just enough to give you an intuitive idea of what's going on.

For Machine Learning, it's best if you take one of the courses on coursera (or read the notes that you have AND implement the assignments/homeworks) because you learn much more even about the theoretical aspects by implementation.

In my experience so far (MS in Computer Science with research in Machine Learning/Computer Vision) Information theory is used only sparingly, and when used, it's more to say that "From Information theory, we know that...."

<TEXT> Ooh nice question.

Arbitrarily small sizes are a pain because molecular effects come into play. But even there, angular momentum is conserved (I think...I vaguely remember something about conserving angular momentum...but an expert shoudl chime in).

But otherwise, angular momentum has nothing to do with restriction. It's a property of the particles. For water with no bathtub, angular momentum is conserved. The angular momentum of the whole ocean is conserved too.

The angular momentum of fluid particles rotating about a vortex center is conserved, irrespective of how close you get to the center (arbitrarily small size), if that's what you're asking. I keep talking about vortices because they kind of generate angular momentum in flows. But the discussion holds true in their absence too, of course.

<TEXT> Yes. All the time. Fill bathtub with water, rotate hand. Remove hand. Angular momentum is conserved, or rather, would have been conserved if it hadn't been for that cursed viscosity.

Planes fly because of lift. Lift generation is explained by vortex structures leaving the plane. The behavior of these vortices (again discounting for cursed viscosity) is governed by the conservation of angular momentum, among other things.

Angular momentum is a property that applies to anything that Newton's Laws applies to, because its conservation is a form of Newton's Laws!

<TEXT> It is not really just stretching. Breathing and meditation are what make Yoga, yoga. 

It's taught in a form that emphasizes the stretching here, which is sad, but necessary to market it effectively.

The benefits that are marketed (inner peace and all that crap) don't come without a huge investment of time and effort into Yoga. And personally, I believe that a similar focus on any activity will give you the same inner peace and crap.

To be fair, Yoga as it was intended is only a way of living. There is even a Yoga called Karma Yoga which says that if you do your duty, you are doing yoga. 

I think what differentiates Yoga from other fitness activities is the philosophical backend. That philosophical backend, however is transferable to any activity. I don't know why people don't do that...maybe because Yoga is a selling point... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll answer the two parts separately (source: My mom received a PhD in Yoga and is part of the transitioning of knowledge from the second half (what the "inventors" did) to the first half (today's scientifically accepted facts )). 

Also, this is an Indian perspective. It seems similar to what I see in the US, but I don't know if my cultureFilter glasses are effective.

The "original" Yogasanas were only loosely scientific. They were based more on the "sages" experimenting with their bodies. When I move this part, I feel something in that part, so if I stretch this way, it must be beneficial. Also, that animal seems to look cool in that pose. It seems like that will help me, let me try that. 

I know that's vague, but the point is that they did not do experiments in a repeatable, verifiable manner. There were no guidelines for people with problems to not do certain asanas. So no, they were not scientific.

However, personal anecdotes and development led to a very strong belief in Yoga. Especially since it was so intimately tied to the Hindu religion. 

Forward to today: There are yoga quacks who teach yogasanas. I know of a case where a teacher made his students do a complex breathing exercise (Bastri + Kapalabhati). He DID NOT tell them (probably did not know either) that the exercise involves extensive use of the lower back. And people came to my mom with damaged lower backs... and they just wanted to do more Yoga to help!! (Well, yoga is excellent for lower back problems, but I'mn sure you see the point I'm making).

The only way out of this is to scientifically examine the effects and benefits of Yoga, and that's what a LOT of researchers are doing these days.

The problem is that the scientific method looks at Yogasanas in a very atomic way instead of a holistic way since well, the "holistic" way is not scientific. It's a fair compromise, I think.

I digressed a lot there. but: 

*tl;dr*: Inventors of Yoga made up asanas based on trial and error and logic. They did not go ahead to scientifically test the benefits and effects of their asanas because they believed in self-experimentation. So, scientific examination is being done today.

On a hike near Seattle, I didn't take my camera and I was marveling at the scenery and the light and the place. I could see the scene completely differently because of my efforts with photography. But without the thoughts of taking a picture, the experience was completely different.

It's like sitting for half an hour on your streetcorner, admiring the light and...that's it. It's a different experience. Different from the photographer taking the picture and different from the guy who likes the view, but doesn't know the things a photographer does. </TEXT>

But then, here they're only worried about making it look realistic. For example, if you wanted the stresses at every point on the cloth when you tear it this code wouldn't give it. But your months-to-make code will. 

If I was the head of a clothing company, I would use your code to design my clothes, and his code for advertising.

Though it *is* still *amazing*, that they're able to simulate the looks of a cloth tearing.

<TEXT> Oh...yeah that's not your fault either. They should see EE and Java and realize that you probably know Java and programming through your EE courses, which have a very different emphasis than the CS courses. 

I was an Aerospace PhD who switched to a CS Masters...so I feel ya.

It would help though, if you read up a bit on Design Patterns and Algorithms...What I did was read up on two CS courses -- 1/ Data Structures and 2/ Algorithms ... that should cover your bases.

In interviews, they generally ask you to rate your skills on a 1 to 10. Be honest. Say you're comfortable with the language, but are learning the concepts, and then talk a bit about Abstract classes and Singletons and all that cool stuff you think they think you should know. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The thing is...as far as the job search goes, it's not your responsibility to see if you're eligible, it's the company's. It doesn't matter what you think of your abilities. If you want the job, apply for it.

Then it's up to them to see if you're a good fit. For example, the entry level developer is a pretty broad position; they might have a particular position in a particular team in mind which requires a more analytic frame of mind which your EE degree would have kindly blessed you with.

So, go forth and be brave. Don't reject yourself. Let them reject you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just took that interview last month and got an offer...Will be glad to answer questions...though I can't deal with specifics of the questions since I signed an NDA.

It's an all-day coding project and you work with what seems to be a simplified version of a real-world problem. You can (and should!) ask questions of your teammates and the employees in the room with you. You can ask Google (I mean, the internet..you'll have access to internet) for help if you want... but basically don't hesitate to ask anyone questions.

The problem really tests your basic coding skills -- whether you can drill a problem down to what it requires, design a data structure for the problem and then use it well to solve it. The one-on-one is very relaxed as well and has to do with the problem itself and make sure you ask him all the questions you have about the work and work culture at Amazon at that interview!

It's a lot of fun and much less stressful than the process at other companies...Good luck! 

And ask away if you have questions... </TEXT>

<TEXT> This may be slightly weird... but whatever, I'm counting on anonymity, even though I'm not using a throwaway.

Here are the facts: I'm 29, only been in one relationship. The sex was bad. I was/am quite bad at it too.

The constraints: I am Asian (Indian) and will soon be under extreme pressure to get married. 

So say I have two years left. 

I've been reading seddit for a while now and have gone from complete AFC to slightly AFC. I can now talk to girls, #-close, but nothing further. I have cultural barriers in addition to confidence barriers. In addition, I assume every girl is racist even though I've mostly found that it's me being racist about myself and everyone else is fine...if that makes sense.

So yeah, say I have two years left and I want to get good at seduction+sex, the whole process.

Plus, I'm moving to Seattle from a really small town in four months.

I want to hit the ground running there. What, specifically, should I do before then to ensure that I have the courage to go out and screw up or screw someone whenever I want to?

<TEXT> I'm a drummer and I'm in college. Get an Electronic Kit (I have the Yamaha Express and it's really good!) and you can play with headphones.

You'll think the electronic kit sounds good at first, then you'll think it sounds like shit when you play on an acoustic kit (esp w.r.t dynamics) after two years and then finally, you'll see you have no choice because of where you live.

As for where to learn, I would strongly recommend taking 2-3 hours of lessons (more if you can afford them) at $20 (or whatever)/hour. It's really worth it and to this day, I regret not taking lessons when I started. It really lays the fundamentals for everything that follows.

<TEXT> I just reopened the book at a random page to find something (and then re-reopened at another random location so that I won't give you spoilers):

"Kid's in the shower", he said, motioning a cigar towards the sound of water hissing in another room. The room in which we stood (we were standing because there was nothing to sit on) seemed as though it were just being moved into; you expected to smell wet paint. Suitcases and unpacked crates were the only furniture. The crates served as tables. One supported the mixings of a martini; another a lamp, a Libertyphone, Holly's red cat and a bowl of yellow roses. Bookcases, covering one wall, boasted a half-shelf of literature. I warmed to the room at once, I liked its fly-by-night look.

It's not that he's describing something special. But as a writer, if I think about it, there's absolutely no way I could have gotten such a strong impression across to the reader in so few words. He knows exactly what in the room (the scene the sounds, the objects...everything!) is relevant to get a feel for the place and the time and the people involved.

Amazing stuff to learn from. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ironic that I'm asking on reddit, yes. But this is where I come to for a lot of my questions.

However, I want to try and stay off reddit for a few (at least two) weeks. I've tried the following and couldn't keep up:

1/ Restrict reddit usage only to specific subreddits
2/ Use StayFocusd
3/ Use a time tracker
4/ Pure will power (this never works for me anyway)

Any ideas you guys have will be greatly appreciated.

The reason I'm doing this: I just went through a really bad time the last few months where I lost a lot that really mattered to me. This has made me realize that unless I make some drastic changes to how I live, well....I will continue living how I live, and I'm not happy with it.

To this end, I want to take out everything till I see myself for what I am, and then let things in one by one. I'm not sure that makes sense (or is even relevant to this post), but reddit is one of these things. So, ideas welcome, even if all you say is "Suck it up and try your ideas again"! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Stretching exercises after SS squat-caused groin pain (PSA and request for advice) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-01-17 03:36:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm on Week 10 (approximately) of Starting Strength and my Squat is at 215x5x3 (My height 6 ft, my weight 171 lbs).

For the last three sessions, the right side of my groin has been hurting when I get to the heavy weights. Today, I finally asked an experienced bodybuilder what I might be doing wrong. He said that it's on one of these three:

1/ I don't warm up
2/ I don't drink enough water
3/ I don't breathe while squatting.

While I do warm, I found out that he was absolutely right about 2/ and 3/. I don't drink water at all and I practically hold my breath. That's why I get dizzy too, supposedly...Who knew? So that's the PSA!

I need advice on what I should do about the groin pain. I find it doesn't interfere with the weights, though it hurts quite a bit on the last few sets.

Should I reset to a lower weight?

Should I not squat for a few days/weeks?

Are there some specific stretches I can/should do?

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, to paraphrase from Oscar Wilde: 

I was working on the proof of one of my poems all the morning, and changed an 'E' to an 'e'. In the afternoon I changed it back.

Really, that's how it happened. I wanted a smooth transition from the shaving gel to the knob to the mental fucking. Somehow, I felt it wasn't smooth till I capitalized the 'E'. Then I thought the capital 'E' was pretentious. Then again, I thought if pretentiousness is what it takes to get my message across, so be it :)

<TEXT> Espresso Royale is okay...Their self-named blend sucks, but the Guatemala and the Peru blends are quite good.

Columbia Street Roastery has a few good blends: The Escobar blend comes to mind. Needless to say, the coffee at Escobar is awesome!

Strange as it may seem, I prefer Caribou Coffee's blend from county market to all of the above! It's available in the coffee aisle by the pound. Best!

If you french press, you should try Aeropress... At least equally good and less mess to clean!

<TEXT> As I came out of the shower  
I saw two bottles of shaving gel  

Next to each other by the sink  

Blue and Orange. And foam  
Between their mouths  

I dried myself and opened the door  

The knob turned slowly in my gentle hands  
Surely Erotic

I turned the lights off   
And for a moment  
Fucked you in my mind  

But I usually forget to turn the lights off  
So before getting out  
I turned them on again </TEXT>

<TITLE> SS and Running and diet question </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-01-13 22:06:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I used to run long distance, but then stopped. I restarted, got up to 12 miles again, and then stopped again when I began the SS program, because I was told that running would interfere with my SS progress.

8 weeks in, my goals have changed:

I want to continue SS, but am no longer too worried about the numbers, as long as they go up somewhat (I'm still on Linear progression and haven't plateaued), but I would like to start running again and training to run really long distances on trails (50 miles or so).

I like SS, so I was wondering how I should modify it so that I can do running on rest days and still not hurt myself or make myself too weak to perform in the rest of my life!

Are there any diet modifications I should be making?

Details... Height 6 ft: Weight: 171 lbs.

Squats: 95 - 195 lbs   
BP: 70 - 115 lbs  
PC: 45 - 85 lbs  
OHP: 45 - 85 lbs  
Deadlift: 95 - 205 lbs   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh I completely agree with this article.  Well, sort of.

I don't know about it becoming a movement and all, but I like thinking and clicking. Sometimes, I put the camera away and try to experience the sight BEFORE clicking away like a madman.

The experience comes first for me. Always. The experience of getting a good photograph because I thought about it comes next. 

Then I click away like the son of a madman and a tourist, and who knows...one of these random clicks turns out better than the one I thought about for an hour. But it's just not the same.

<TEXT> Hello /r/photography,

I've been thinking and clicking away happily for a few years now and wanted some tips on the quick, bad world of snowboarding photography.

I'm going this weekend and wanted to get the best snaps I can. My camera (an old Nikon D40) is not particularly valuable any more, so I'm okay with it getting a little worse for the wear.

I have an ND filter to allow me to take some interesting things during the day... But any tips and tricks from you guys, some of whom I'm sure have done this before.

I'll be snowboarding AND taking pics of my friends...so no equipment or extra lenses other than the camera kit lenses this time for me! </TEXT>

For example, I got stuck at 195 lbs on Squat (did 2x5 + 1x4), so I went back down to 185 the next workout and then managed the 3x5 the the time after that.

Is that reasonable or should I reset by a smaller/bigger amount? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because the right half will fall down, string, hammock and person included. 

The system "Hammock plus person" needs to be held up, not just the person. For this system, him holding up the hammock is an internal force, so it cannot produce acceleration.

You need an external force, i.e. the reaction force of a tree to counter the other external force - gravity in order for the hammock to not fall down.

More generally, you have to be self-reliant, but you have to know that sometimes you need help. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello all. I'm a SS beginner (BP 120 LBs). Today was the day I was supposed to get to 120 lbs, that is. 

I made a dumb mistake and put on 5 instead of 2.5 on both sides. So the weight was 125 instead of 120.

I did 5, then 4 almost to failure. Then I waited for two minutes and tried again. On the the third lift, the weights jerked a little and I snapped it back on the rack, unevenly at that.

So now my right shoulder hurts. It doesn't hurt too bad, so I'm sure it's not serious. It hurts when I open doors, when I try and lift something with my right hand and so on...

It's not serious enough for a doctor for sure, and I think it'll go away with time. But is there anything I can do in the meanwhile? 

Thanks for any help and sorry if the question is dumb.. </TEXT>

However, I feel like I'm losing something when I'm happy. When I'm confident. When I'm all these things that I'm supposed to strive towards.

I feel like I'm losing a certain depth in my character. A depth that lets me understand me and the world on such a visceral, sensual level. A depth that lets me relate to myself so intimately. A sorrow that's as loving as it's hurtful.

Maybe it's because I haven't been on the positive side of the emotion axis for so long, but happiness is scary. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My friends and I were planning to go camping in Mammoth Cave NP for 2 nights + 3 days over New Years.

But now, I've been hearing that there isn't enough to do in Mammoth Cave NP over three days and that the caves are very similar unless you know about caves, which we don't.

Is that true? If so, are there other long/hard trails to do in/around the NP? 

We'll be carcamping, not backpacking on this trip. That's the only thing that's certain so far.

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Self post about the self improvement part and specific advice about how to deal with a current girl problem (well, the problem is AFC me) </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been an AFC all my life.  And I'm 28 now, almost 29. 

Only one three year relationship so far -- AFC, failure, beta, all that crap. 

After that, two years in extreme oneitis with a girl. Friendzoned hard because of my constant need for approval from her. I could have learnt something from her...she was always clear about what she wanted, while I was always thinking about what she wanted, not what I wanted.

Until now. A few weeks back, she suddenly gave me IOI. Maybe it was because I was climbing steps in my inner game ladder, but whatever. Once she told me she was always thinking about me, I completely lost it and went back to being a needy, desperate bitch.

I'm not good at approaching. At all. And other personal problems in my life prevent me from actually meeting new people right now.

How do I deal with her? She gave up on me pretty quickly and started going out with someone else. 

Well, I know what to do. I need to stay away from her at least for a while, but every day I find myself messaging and asking how she's doing, even with no real response.

So, seddit, now that I'm at rock bottom, I know it's all my fault and I need to get back on the change ladder. How do I deal with this? How do I deal with her? </TEXT>

<TEXT> A poem is not the truth  
Though it is truer  
Than everything else  

My glass is here beside me  
Empty now  
The band plays  
The singer sings  
And the dancers dance  
Only for me.  

A poem is not love  
And my love is not a poem  

Nor is a poem the cure.  

No.  

It is only a bandage,  
Smaller than the wound. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Doing Starting Strengths (1 month now and this is where I am):

Squats: 150
BP: 115
Deadlift: 145
OHP: 65
PC: 65

On rest days I do biking (20-30 miles) or running (6-8 miles) or swimming (not much, maybe 500 yards)

Do those numbers look okay? Sorry I'm asking dumb questions even though it's not Moronic Monday. I really do not have friends who do anything that resembles lifting and it just feels like I'm treading deep waters by myself here.

I'm 6'0 and weigh 160 lbs.

I'm learning PCs on my own (from the book and youtube) and I'm really apprehensive about my form...Any tips about common mistakes that people make are welcome!

<TEXT> Yes yes, physical activity counts.

My mom was a yoga teacher, and she was pretty far down the road. She told me once, in one of her random deathbed talks, that in the beginning, she thought that meditation was this thing where you needed to sit and be still and think nothing.

But eventually she realized that everything is and can be meditation. If you are completely focused on what you are doing, whatever it is, you are meditating. For her, life was meditation.

However, to start with, pay attention to your breathing. That's all it takes to start off. Keep your eyes open or closed. Walk if you want, but pay attention to your breathing. </TEXT>

It is the curse of famous people to be judged by everyone. Poets, even more since through their poems, we assume we know them as well as they know themselves. Bukowski, even more than that, since honesty (like one of his women) seems to scream and lash out from his poems.

And free will. 

And I think of you  

Wondering if

Whether your hips are touching

Whether if  
At home  
You play with your hair
In front of him  

Whether you fuck like animals  
Or stuffed toys  
Stuffing each other with joy

My head fills with images  
My stomach with pain  
My heart with lead  

I ask him if he wants anything  
He says no

I get myself some tea  
And look away into the  
Glitter of streetlights.

I don't achieve them and I think to myself: _It's not me, it's the goals. They need to be smaller_ and I try yet again.

Finally I find myself putting away one book instead of cleaning the room and thinking to myself: _What the fuck have I become?_ 

I find myself unable to stop thinking about the girl. I try to think of her less and think of her more. I let thoughts of her come in freely and they never stop. I care for her. She cares for me, but not like I used to want her to. I no longer know what I want. From her, or from me.

Overall failing quite badly at life. Trying, and then failing again. Trying, and then failing again. I have friends, but no one to talk to about this. Not really. Tell me what to do, dear reddit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But at the same time, NaNo basically lets you write anything and get away with it. 50,000 words of Pokemon fanfiction? Sure. 50,000 words of the same repetitive sentence structure over and over? Fantastic. The word "butt" repeated 50,000 times? You win!

What? No. this month, you're the winner, you're the participant, you're the judge. The website only handles the wordcount.

If a person thinks he/she won by repeating the same word 50,000 times, I don't think the blame rests with the concept of NanoWrimo.

As for Pokemon fanfiction, of course! Who knows what brilliant ideas for space opera, love stories, zombies, adventure you'll come up with on the way to those 50,000 words. 

For me, NanoWriMo is about the side effects more than the drug itself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Only insofar as the turbulence prevents boundary layer separation. For a well-streamlines body where the laminar boundary layer doesn't separate, laminar flow decreases skin drag for the same form drag. The big difference is, of course, form drag for separated laminar boundary layer vs. attached turbulent BL.

Yup, my bad. You're right!

Hmm..I agree AND disagree with you about circulation theory. I mean, it's the only way to include a viscous phenomena (stagnation point at the trailing edge) in an otherwise completely inviscid analysis. Physically of course, the problem is that we're assuming inviscid flow while squeezing in the effect of viscosity however we can. Because: Without viscosity, we don't have lift. With viscosity, the analysis is crazy. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2012-11-05 07:38:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I recently bought a plain white formal shirt that I thought fit perfectly. However, I went to buy a suit and the salesman guy told me the shirt was too short since the sleeve wasn't visible under the suit. I thought the suit sleeve was too long. He said the suit sleeve was in fact slightly short and the shirt sleeve too short!

The shirt was such that it came up to the end of the wrist. The guy told me that when your hands are relaxed, the suit should come up to 0.5" above the start of the thumb and the shirt all the way to the thumb. He also said my arms are unusually long, so it would be best if I got a shirt tailored.

I trusted him and took the leap. I'm just wondering if what he said actually makes sense...Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Highly opinionated list ordered based only on the order I thought about them.

1. Kopi -- Coffee's okay, place is very nice, 50c refills
2. Pekara - Coffee's better than okay, place is okay
3. Paradiso - Coffee's pretentiously okay, place is pretentiously okay, everything is pretentiously expensive. 
4. Panera - Coffee's okay (Free refills if you take the mug!), place is okay except for mealtimes
5. Starbucks - Meh
6. Giuliani - :( :( :( :( Best of all, but unfortunately closed.
7. Zojo - Coffee is excellent! Especially the pour-over. Place is nice, but far(rish) from campus... Evidently they use the same coffee as paradiso, but maybe they brew it better? Tastes better for sure. Maybe they're less pretentious.

<TEXT> No. The probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics would in fact, preclude the knowledge of every single initial variable at the time of the big bang!

But, if that knowledge was somehow available.. everything since would be predictable, in my opinion.

However, it is important to note that the "knowledge" itself is included in the variables, since knowledge itself is chemical reactions in the brain. So this question itself is meaningless, in my opinion. This is beyond self-aware, since the reactions that produce knowledge will need to react to themselves...phew...I'm beyond my depth here evidently

EDIT: I guess what I'm saying is that to know what OP is saying we should know is equivalent to saying that we would BE the universe...or an equivalent sized computer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My friend and I have been traveling quite a bit recently and learning to take good photographs along the way.

We saw a post here recently from the creator of http://stoked.in and were really, really inspired! If the creator is seeing this, Thank you!! 

Well, so I want to start a website for us. It doesn't need to be as good as stoked, of course. But I was curious about what it would cost to have a nice site up and running....We're not particularly interested in selling our prints. It's just something that we can feel happy about..

Is it better to use wordpress.org or to custom-design our own website? Both in terms of design and cost. 

Thank you for any help provided! </TEXT>

<TEXT> You have to make the effort to go to remote places, and then there won't be crowds. When I went to Yellowstone, we stayed away from the tourist spots and were left to ourselves.

One sunrise, I walked a mile from my tent towards the river to get this shot: http://www.flickr.com/photos/pritamps/6227387180/in/photostream And there was absolutely no one apart from me there.

This shot of the Prismatic spring (http://www.flickr.com/photos/pritamps/6227410228/in/photostream), there were crowds around the spring, so we went behind it and climbed a hill. There were still people, but far fewer.

Well I guess the article makes this point too. But for me, as I visit more parks, photography becomes less about the photo than about taking cool pictures because I could make it to an awesome place.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The air flowing over a wing needs to be at least somewhat "straight." With air flowing over and under the wing in the pattern a propeller causes (more-or-less a vortex), you wind up getting a substantial reduction in lift. Sure, there's high speed air over the top of the wing. But it's also over the bottom. In fact, turbofan aircraft may have a lift advantage over prop planes precisely because the air around the engines is going to be less perturbed than the air around a prop.

No no. Air perturbation has nothing (well very little) to do with lift. Turbulent drag is LESS than laminar drag. Channel wing aircraft did produce greater lift than regular aircraft! There were other problems with the aircraft, including construction difficulties, structural problems, slow climb and higher form drag.

Propellers DO increase lift over the wing. There are toy aircraft that wouldn't even fly if this wasn't true. The Bernoulli's explanation for lift in the first place is wrong. You say "more-or-less a vortex". Without a "vortex", there wouldn't be lift at all. The flow behind a propeller is not at all a vortex. It has a vortex structure similar the flow behind a wing, kind of twisted to form of a helix.

<TEXT> Right you are again. There is significant torque... The engine applies torque (say clockwise), and so the aircraft has to experience a reaction torque (counter clockwise). There are other effects, but this is the main one. 

This generally results in a left turning tendency for the aircraft, which is commonly corrected with rudder input. 

I remember trying a UAV flight simulator and wondering if there was a bug because the aircraft was constantly turning left! The bug was all in my head :-D  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My PhD research is on propeller-aircraft interaction. 
Basically, from my understanding, the high speed airflow from the propellers flowing over the wings would produce more lift at lower speed (relative to the ground), where as the jet counterpart doesn't have the same benefit.

Yes. Completely. But propellers get less and less efficient as speed increases. In fact at a certain point, they start producing negative thrust (Windmilling!) That's why low speed aircraft are propeller-driven and high speed ones are jet driven.

 In the case of prop plane, there's the Bernoulli principle pushing the wings up, but I don't see a force pushing down on the engine and prop.

The propeller doesn't really produce much lift. The flow over the propeller - because of the rotation - is close to tangential to the blade (well ideally :) ) and so the "lift" is thrust. 

Well, the Bernoulli principle is NOT what pushes the wing up or causes lift. The Bernoulli principle is just a relation between velocity and pressure in already established, inviscid flow, whereas lift is impossible in inviscid flow. But that is a separate discussion and not what you asked.

The force that pushes "up" on the wings (and everything directly and indirectly connected to it) is of course, the aircraft lift. The force that pushes down on the engine and the prop is the same as the force that pushes down on everything -- The weight!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Aerodynamically it may work. The drag and lift both will increase immensely because water is a thousand times more dense than air. And the friction drag will also be much, much higer because the viscosity of water is much greater than air.

So I don't think the engine will have enough power (even if it DID work under water!) to actually propel the aircraft forward. Plus there's cavitation and other issues which arise due to the differences in fluid properties!

<TEXT> Of course, I don't know where anything wazotea said contradicted with anything you're now saying or where you get this idea that the Butterfly effect is simple. Of course physical processes have to occur between the butterfly flapping its wings and a tornado... Chaos theory is exactly about the complexities of a highly nonlinear system! Don't really know what you mean when you say highly non-ideal. Every model has to make assumptions about behavior. That's why they're called models and not reality. 

Anyone who works in Chaos theory will tell you that is in fact, the exact opposite of convenient. It's just scientists making the best (in really amazing, creative ways) of a very bad situation in their attempts to understand nature.

I also notice you still haven't provided sources for your "Chaos has been widely regarded as wrong" statement...

EDIT: I just noticed something from your first post. You said: 

This, and what remained of your post are typical "chaos theory / butterfly effect" nonsense. There is no scientific proof of anything similar to this, it's all "mathematical" with a number of missing physical components. One such component is the compressibility of air, for example, which when perturbed on small scales, the air compresses and decompresses. With internal friction, any kinetic energy imparted to the system is dissipated as heat. Not propagated "exponentially".

In fact, if a disturbance were propagated "exponentially", it would not be chaotic. Don't know where you got that from either...

That's it. No references from you, no arguments against the article I've provided -- no replies from me from this point. Unless we meet face to face. Then we can talk over a beer :) </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Under actual atmospheric conditions, there is currently no way to prove that chaos / butterfly effects actually determines anything in the atmosphere. In fact, I feel confident in saying that all atmospheric motions are governed by physical processes. We may not know all of these physical processes, we certainly don't know how to simulate them accurately and precisely enough to incorporate all relevant quantities

Oh yes of course! That's exactly what it is. It's because we can't simulate them that we need mathematical theories. And it's because when simulating them, we find many surprising things that we didn't expect. Like the fact that if x is very close to 'y' at time 't', they will then stay close (at least within a certain bound that depends on how close they are) for the future. The absence of this theory is what chaos is about.

I have no idea why you think chaotic process are NOT governed by physical motions :-/ Also chaos in the atmosphere seems quite highly regarded. I also don't know why you think they are "well established as grossly incorrect". Do you have any sources for this? The above article has the following to say: *Most scientists agreed that climate has features of a chaotic system, but they did not think it was wholly unpredictable.* If that's what you're saying, I agree with you of course
Here is an article with many references that seems to regard chaos theory as an important tool: http://www.aip.org/history/climate/chaos.htm

In my head chaos theory IS a mathematical tool, not a "physical" one, though the line is pretty blurry (that's a philosophical debate). A chaotic process is just one where if x is close to y...I already said that. All of physical modeling depends on the predictability of the model. That's really all there is to it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know much about meteorology, but I can say that wazoheat makes PERFECT sense to me. I am an aerodynamics researcher and I deal with turbulence, which has exactly the same problem. Molecular interactions have effects on large scale eddies and so on.

What you're getting confused with is probably the following: A single car may have effects on the chance of rain. That does not mean that every single car will have an effect. It means that some car starts a change, which when interacting with changes with fifty other cars and buildings and miscellaneous things (that sounds like the "Favourite Things" song!), leads to major effects. 

So overall, what is causing the big change is not JUST the car as the butterfly effect seems to imply. But without the car, the change would not have occured! 

If that makes sense to you (and I hope it does!), now it should be easy to see that unless we are able to model the car, and the fifty other things, we cannot predict the weather a month from now! Unfortunately, modeling the car is outside the scope of current computational abilities.

By a "Theoretical" limit on the models, I always understand it this way (and this was what I was taught in graduate level turbulence and numerical fluid dynamics): Since molecular interactions have effects on macroscale events, we will have to model their interactions along with macroscale interactions. Now, these interactions are unfortunately (for us), related! So, the only way to resolve this would be to model all the molecules and all the interactions!! This inability to resolve all important scales of a problem results in a limit on our capacity to model a lot of turbulent phenomena.

Like the saying goes, to model the universe accurately, you have to create another universe.

Sorry, I got carried away with turbulence, but the two are very related, it seems to me.

EDIT: You're right in your last sentence!! Sorry,  I just read that. That's exactly the problem that turbulence faces, except that in addition, it's IMPOSSIBLE to separate the temporal and spatial scales, because they're coupled through various interactions,  a subset of which is the famed Butterfly effect that you seem to despise so strongly :)

EDIT 2: Also, you're wrong about all disturbances being dissipated. First off, it's viscosity (not conservative), not compressibility (conservative) that causes the dissipation. And for many disturbances, they propagate because of instability grow very quickly before viscosity can take hold. See any textbook/online explanation of how turbulence comes about and small scale disturbances grow... There is only so much the already small viscosity of air can take care of. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Technobabble? Seriously? That friction accelerates a rolling body (in this case the wheel)? http://cnx.org/content/m14385/latest/ 

You say "This is your speculation. Not any kind of scientific fact", but you say exactly the same thing I did when you said: "This is also true, but has almost no measurable effect." In fact the difference in friction is very easily measurable. 

I stand by the scientific correctness of all that I said. I already admitted it wasn't the answer to this particular question. 

EDIT: Also, the square-cube law has to do between the relation between the weight (volume multiplied by density)and the size of an object. Did you even read the link you posted? Not the force due to gravity and the force due to drag. Drag increases with the frontal area (S), the velocity (V) and the aerodynamics (all included in the coefficient of drag C_D.. also where the square-cubed law is relevant because weight increases proportional to (size)^(3/2)). It is NOT related to the gravity in anyway except through the velocity, a relation that has nothing to do with the square-cube law. Also, the answer to this problem is independent of whether they reach terminal velocity or not.

Though really, I don't mind the downvotes. My answer was not really relevant to the question. But most of what you said really, is wrong. </TEXT>

**a tl;dr of the article from the article**(since I took the effort of googling and clicking on the very first result for you, I might as well do this too): 
In a now-famous paper, Stephen Jay Gould and Richard C. Lewontin emphasize that we should not immediately assume that every trait has an adaptive explanation. Just as the spandrels of St. Mark's domed cathedral in Venice are simply an architectural consequence of the meeting of a vaulted ceiling with its supporting pillars, the presence of nipples in male mammals is a genetic architectural by-product of nipples in females. So, why do men have nipples? Because females do.

<TEXT> Momentum is the amount of "motion" in a body, while Kinetic energy is the amount of - like you said - "energy"

The immediate relation between KE and momentum comes from the simple fact that momentum is the amount of motion and Kinetic energy is exactly the amount of energy used in that motion! So yes, they are intimately related.

Intuitively, it's easy to see why the amount of motion is directly proportional to the velocity, because well, that's exactly the way motion is defined (an object moving with a certain velocity)

That brings us to why KE is proportional to the square of velocity. Let me illustrate this with an example which we'll build and then solve -- all step by step.

1/ Think of KE as the amount of work needed to bring a moving body to a standstill (Actually, that's exactly what it is).
2/ Imagine you're applying a constant force to do this (just to give you an intuition)
3/ Think of two bodies of the same mass, Body 1 moving at velocity 'v' and Body 2 moving at velocity '2v'.

4/ Since you're applying a constant force, the (-ve) acceleration of both bodies will be the same, so it will take twice the amount of time to stop Body 2 as Body 1
5/ But work is (the integral of) (Force) x (dDistance). Since Body 2 is traveling faster than Body 1, it travels more than twice the distance as body 1. And so, the work needed to stop it is more than twice the amount of work needed to stop body 1
6/ i.e. The KE of body 2 is more than twice the KE of body 1. i.e. The degree of relation with velocity is greater than 1 for sure.

How much greater, you say? That's your simple math. Integration will show you that the degree of the relation is 2. 

Intuitively, Body 2 will travel four times as far to stop as Body 1 (That should be easy to see). </TEXT>

So the front is the best, followed by the back (tail), followed by the wing.

However, a counterpoint to this is that you have to think about the kind of turbulence you encounter. For example, if the effect is a pitching moment about the center of pressure, then the front would be a bad place, since it would get displaced the most. A rolling moment -- the center row is best. A yawing moment -- over the wing.

Basically, turbulence is a bitch and a plane is not a bus. There is no best place.

<TEXT> Well yes...since the can explodes due to the pressure from inside the can. In fact, it should explode with lesser shaking, because the pressure difference between the inside and outside is lower (pressure outside is zero). </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem is that Hollywood also doesn't render it in real time. The renders for photorealistic CGI take a long time (days even for a single frame some time, depending on the lighting etc). The video is only a sequence of these rendered images which is then saved to disk. Not even close to realtime. 

For gaming, you need real-time rendering, where user actions will control the lighting and so frames (at least the changed parts) will need to be re-rendered.

So while you're right about it being a matter of time, it's probably a long time away still. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There seems to be some confusion here.

In vacuum, the terminal velocity is the speed of light, which is related to the mass, yes. That's where Einstein is king and relativity doesn't allow anything to cross the speed of light. Irrespective of your mass, the terminal velocity is 'c'.

In no-vacuum, the terminal velocity is the speed at which drag is the same as gravity, so the object cannot accelerate. Here, Newton is king and the terminal velocity is dependent on the shape (frontal area) of the object among other things.

I don't know what the Higg's field is, so if that's somehow relevant, I'm completely wrong about the first part. I'm only an aerodynamicist and confident about the second. </TEXT>

I started SS a few months back (already posted twice about it). Currently, due to a family emergency, I had to travel back home and don't have access to a gym.

In the last two weeks, I haven't done anything. 

I really don't want to waste whatever little gains I've got, so does anybody have any advice on what I should do, considering I don't have access to a gym (at all...), but I do have space for bodyweight stuff. 

Currently, all I do is pushups... </TEXT>

<TEXT> A disclaimer: I've never been to a therapist, and I do not have the money to go to one. 

Two years back (or maybe one and a half), I was really out of it. There was a girl, and there was work and there was my sick mother and all together, they had pushed me over some edge I didn't even know existed.

Even though they were definite causes, I slipped into some sort of meaningless sorrow, where I would be sad and/or angry for absolutely no reason. I would walk around punching trees till my hand swelled up. I would burn myself with cigarette butts. And I would have no idea why I did what I just did.

Now, I can't relate to that version of me AT ALL. Even though I still feel that deep, deep sorrow some times, and a less deep constant numbness all the time, I can't imagine at all burning myself. That pain...

Anyway, I seem to have gotten completely distracted. So, I mentioned my mother was sick, right... she died two weeks back. And it was quite bad. 

But in no way was it as bad as what I call my depression...and that scares me... </TEXT>

<TITLE> Starting Strength OHP and Power Clean alternatives </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-10-15 02:31:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello all,

I'm starting the SS program, and because of a complete lack of interest from all my friends, I've been doing it on my own. 

The problem is that OHP and Power Clean look like very umm..."dangerous" exercises, i.e., wrong form can injure you seriously (more so than squats, deadlifts and bench presses), so I'm too apprehensive to try them alone.

In fact, I even got advice from a random cool dude in the gym about my wrong squat form, which made me even more apprehensive to try the Power Clean and the OHP...

Are there alternatives which would give similar results? 

(Ir?)relevant info: I'm a runner (5k in 17 m 30' to give an idea of pace), 180 cm, 74 kg (163 lb) and want to get strong, but not bulky (well...no interest in bulk, to be precise) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Tips for running looong distances </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-10-02 00:21:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello /r/running, this is my first post here... but I've been running a while. I was on my college athletics squad back in India for long distance (well 5000 m track), and then stopped running completely and started again about 4 months back because I read **Born to Run**

Corny as that sounds, I was really inspired by how over-the-top enthusiastic the author was. I'm not really into equipment (including the vibram shoes) or into timing my runs. I just really like running. I've never run a marathon and I never intend to do it.

That should tell you something about the kind of runner I am. I just like to run...that's about it. I run for varying amounts of time, speed and distance (5 to 13 miles at 7:30 to 10:00 per mile) depending more on my mood than anything else.

But I do love trail running and I really want to get to the point where I can do the Zion National Traverse in a day. That's 48 miles. 

My question (sorry for all the irrelevant information, but I like talking about this stuff) is how do I get from a relaxed 13 miles to a relaxed 48 miles? 

I ran the 13 miles in two hours and wasn't really tired at the end (but my legs were sore, probably because I haven't run in a while), if that helps with judging my running ability... </TEXT>

<TITLE> Processed photos for the first time after taking photographs for five years: This is what I think </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-09-10 07:34:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, this is my photostream on flickr: http://www.flickr.com/photos/pritamps . None (or maybe one somewhere) of those photos is processed. I had stayed away from processing because of two reasons:

1. I believed that, as a beginner, I needed to learn how to take photographs
2. I was lazy

I decided some time back that I was just avoiding processing for no real reason and everyone was doing it anyway. So I decided I would learn Lightroom. I actually posted on here and got great feedback on learning how to use Lightroom (http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/xc64s/postprocessing/) 

My first chance to use my skills on photos from a recent trip to Yosemite.

Here are my thoughts:

1. **While taking pictures**, I was less worried about the getting the settings right. At one point, getting the camera back from a friend, I continued shooting in Auto and thinking to myself that the overexposure could easily be fixed in Lightroom. I realized even at that point in time that I wasn't enjoying myself with taking pictures as much as I usually do. The composition half was the same, of course, but I was no longer playing with settings and irritating my friend to stand still while I tried various combinations.

2. **While processing** I really hated correcting the setting mistakes. I was really ashamed of the pics that were underexposed, overexposed etc. _It turns out that at some point in my discovery of photography, I had grown to love the process of making sure the composition and settings were right in camera_.

3. **While processing** I really, really came to love the crop tool. Having never used it before, I had never imagined that just cutting out part of a photo could be so powerful in getting the feeling I want from a photograph across.

4. Processing takes up much more time than I thought and as far as Lightroom is concerned, is very monotonous. Lightroom is designed to reduce this monotony, I know. But it's still a pain..

Anyway, I just wanted to put this out there and get some opinions from /r/photography on the whole processing...process. None of my friends are into photography like I am, so reddit is where I talk about this stuff. What do you guys post-process for? What's your philosophy on it?

I think I see the point of processing for professional photographers, where the end product is all-important. But for me, I think I will stay away from post-processing (except for cropping, that shit is awesome) and _enjoy the process of taking the pictures_ more. 

**tl;dr** Tried post-processing...see the point, but don't really think it's for me. What do you guys think? </TEXT>

All this is after you take lots of pictures. Take pictures. Crappy pictures of air conditioners where you obsess over the angle of the vents. Pictures of dogs, where you try to frame one nostril and a leaf. You get the idea. 

It's like that common saying that you need 10000 hours to become an expert. If you want to feel, you have to learn to feel. Just keep taking pictures. 

INTERNALIZE ALL THE CONCEPTS!

You should be having fun taking pictures. Take your camera everywhere, or at least walk it on a tight leash for an hour every day. Eventually you'll find that the camera is asking you to click pictures of that strange glow on the sidewalk at night.

<TEXT> It would be the same. Shockwaves et al. The speed of sound is in fact a measure (well sort of) of the compressibility of a medium. In a truly incompressible medium, speed of sound is infinity.

So a torpedo breaking the speed of sound would cause a very similar reaction as in air. The answer is similar for your second question as well.

Though, the shockwave might decay sooner due to the higher viscosity of water. This is something I'm not fully sure of...

Also, of course, the drag of the torpedo is much, much higher and the speed of sound is also much, much higher, so getting to the supersonic region would be pretty much impossible.

**tl;dr** Speed of sound is infinity in incompressible medium. There are no shockwaves in incompressible flow.

<TEXT> Umm...When a scientist asks "Why?", he really means "How?", which refers to the underlying mechanisms that get the sound out of the bird and how that sound is heard by humans and interpreted as song by a combination of stuff happening in the brain.

When an artist looks at a bird singing, he/she takes all of the above for granted and looks at the aesthetic qualities of the song. These aesthetic qualities are subjective. By subjective, I mean that they involve a lot of processes in the brain and science still hasn't got to that point.

My opinion, that would be. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay. I can do 60 kg wooden plank, facing the wind (i.e. the wind is blowing on the flat side).

Drag coefficient of flat plate = 1.17

Force on plate = Cd * 0.5 * V2 (velocity squared) * S (area)

Let S = 180 * 30 (6ft by 1ft) cm^2 = 0.54 m^2

So force is = 0.3159 V2

This force will act through the center of the plank.

Now imagine a plank standing on it's side and weighing 74 kg (my weight). Thickness of the plank is 30 cm (0.3 m), i.e. my foot.

Now the weight will act through the center of mass of the plank, i.e. 0.15 m from the edge. 

So the moment due to the weight will be 74 * 9.8 * 0.15 ( 9.8 is gravity). = 108.78 N-m 

The drag (force due to wind) acts through half the height of the plank (90 cm = 0.9 m). So the moment is

0.3159 * v^2 * 0.9

So equating both moments

0.3159 * v^2 * 0.9  = 108.78

i.e v = 19.5 m/s

i.e. Works out to **43 mph.**

I had assumed I would get an answer closer to 80 despite the fact that this analysis assumes that the plank doesn't exert any force to stay upright, but oh well :) 

********
Well, Wikipedia says that drag coefficient for a tall flat plate is 1.98!!

So the drag force will now be 108.78 * 1.98/1.17 = 184.089

And so the new speed will be **53 mph**.

Not bad...But really, I think all that's missing is to increase the net drag because the human will also exert a moment to stay upright.

EDIT: Also missing is the fact that a non-perpendicular wind would need to be stronger...Phew </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think we're doing the whole calculations consciously. 

What we're doing (I think, and from a weak robotics background and observation) is akin to closed loop control. We guess where the baseball is going to be and keep our hands there. Then keep updating the position of our hand as we keep observing the baseball.

This way, we only need to do basic math (move hand delta left/right/up/down/forward/back) instead of complete calculations (move hand to (x,y,z) ). These calculations are much simpler and don't need to take into account a million different things.

<TEXT> No. No one's given up.

It's not only a matter of finding out which senses to provide (which in itself is very complicated).

For one, the number of parallel computations in the brain is far beyond what any computer today is capable of. Also, AI is being approached from a thousand different angles.

Take the simple thing Input - Process - Output. Research is focusing on learning (i.e. making a robot learn) how to categorize input, to learn how to process, to learn how to output. And every combination and small step in between.

In a senior level AI course that I took, the professor told us this at the beginning: "People think we have 1 mile to go, and so the media tells us we're almost there. The truth is we've gone 5 miles and now we think there's 100 miles to go"

It is also very important to realize that AI has actually overtaken the brain in many things. Machine learning algorithms can take many decisions faster and better than their human counterparts, as evidenced by tests on medical diagnoses, fly-by-wire systems. To me somehow, even though these things aren't "true" intelligence, it is just as impressive. 

Anyway the definition of "true" intelligence comes from our intelligence, so we're inherently biased ;-)

In my opinion however, before pure AI reaches intelligence, we'll all be hybrids, ala Ghost in the Shell.

<TEXT> I can answer some questions:

Will the S2 be outdated anytime soon? I know that it won't be getting Jellybean, how much will I be missing?

I don't think it'll be "too outdated", i.e. it'll only feel outdated if you feel jealous of people who will have better phones than you. It will be able to everything you want.

Unofficial Jellybean builds are already out. I used Jellybean for a few days. Was a lot of fun. Google now is really cool. You have to root, of course.

How big is the switch from Gingerbread to ICS? 

ICS is like Windows XP to Windows 7

If I root the phone, can I get rid of the bloatware that service provider install on the phone ?

Yes.

Can I brick the phone while rooting? If yes can it be unbricked?

Yes. Yes.

Can the S2 be used as a wifi hotspot for my ipad? I know it can be done with android tablet but I'm not sure about the ipad.

It can be used as a hotspot yes. I can't see why anything that can connect to wifi can't connect to it.

Does the phone matter when used as a hotspot i.e. any differences (network-wise) between S2 and an older android phone? -What's the best variant of the S2 to buy, I think I got some choices between i9100, i9100P, i9100G and the T-mobile's one (SGH-T989)?

No idea. But the T-mobile phone has more ROMs, so more hacking fun.

Just to make sure I'm not missing on anything: is there any better choice than the S2? Something with the lastest hardware/software like the S3 but with similar shape/form factor as the S2/Ip4?

Of course everything with better hardware is better! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Aerospace Engineer here, but guessing nevertheless!

1/ The wind conditions would be very very unpredictable for one. Lack in wind and the rover doesn't land. We don't have wind measurements at all the heights that the Mars rover is going to land in, so calibrating the supply would be a big headache.

2/ Power requirements: Maybe whatever they're using is just more efficient. Maybe it's easier to design.

3/ A rotating thing in space just seems to make bad engineering sense to me. One broken blade, one screw comes loose and everything goes to the dogs. No moving parts unless necessary (I see you have something against comments that mention moving parts, but really...even if there were a hundred moving parts and you could avoid the next one, you should. Moving parts suck)

<TEXT> The tiles are for shielding. The material is what makes the difference. I don't think anything else really matters.

I saw a demonstration once where a guy held a space shuttle tile from one side. A flame torch was blown on the other side for more than 5 minutes and the heat didn't reach his hand at all! The material is really, really heat resistant. 

And a lot of them are white too :-/

<TEXT> I started taking pictures a few years back and didn't do any processing. More so because I was lazy to learn than anything else.

My photostream is here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/pritamps (Just lost pro status, sorry!). None of the photos on there are processed. I used to be proud of that for some reason. 

Now, I'm ready. I have Lightroom installed and want to learn the basics (color adjustments, tonal curves etc.)

Are there some good tutorials about this? Books or something along the lines that give me an idea of what good processing is would be good as well!

I did check out r/Lightroom, but it's not active at all..

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Here are the facts. That's all I have the energy for right now:

1. I am a poor, unfunded graduate student.
2. My mom had a brain tumor 4 years back. She was getting better. Everyone (including the doctors) said she was the bravest patient they'd seen. She was the prime example of how a lifelong practice of Yoga helps someone get over the toughest obstacles. Then she got two more tumors in the spine and was paralyzed, immobilized, disoriented and delirious. Yoga could go fuck itself. God laughed in her face. Now show me what you've got, He said from the nothingness that he is. She's deteriorating every day, and there's nothing anybody can do about it.
3. My sister-in-law is pregnant. The baby was the answer to all our problems. Where if we looked one way at my mom, we would be unhappy thinking about the amazing woman she was, we would be happy looking at the baby, with all its potential for the future. The baby is now diagnosed with Down Syndrome.
4. I can't do anything for any of these people. All I can do is fly from one house to the other, spend a little time with them and get back to my own miserable existence, which involves whiskey, cigarettes and loneliness of the worst kind in large quantities.

I know I'll learn to deal with all of this in time. But what do I do today?

I have no one to talk to. Well, I do. But I don't want to trouble any of them.  Reddit, so I'm troubling you. I don't know why. I'm sorry.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm a grad student who's done most of his programming in Matlab and now, due to speed considerations on numerical simulations, have to program in C++.

I am familiar with syntax and some level of OOP concepts, but most of my C++ programming so far has been on Linux, where writing (in Vim) and compiling (g++) has never been an issue.

Now however, my laptop has Windows and I have no idea what to use to compile etc and would welcome suggestions. I do think Vim on windows looks ugly.

Eclipse seems cool, but seems like too much for me. Does anyone have anything to say about it?

What about QT creator? I seem to see only good things being said about it, but is it still worth considering if my program will not have a GUI?

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the recommendations! Got even more useful information than I had expected! I am going to try Mex with MS Virtual Studio first and parallelly install Linux in parallel.   </TEXT>

Your answer begets 50 more questions, like what are series, how do we know they converge, which leads to sequences and the foundations of real analysis.

Answering those questions is exactly what college math is about, so the teacher was right, I would say. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I got a Galaxy S2 yesterday...

I had a Motorola Bravo till then, which was a cheap, slow but did-what-a-cheap-phone-should-do phone. The Galaxy (even though it seems like the S2 is behind the curve) is much, much faster, smoother and all that.

It has Gingerbread (2.3.7).

I tried rooting it yesterday. I rooted with a 2.3.4 zedomax kernel (only because that was the most popular result on Google) and my Wifi stopped working. I flashed a Shiyah kernel to fix it and then everything stopped working. After a very scary fifteen minutes, i unrooted to 2.3.4 and then upgraded back to 2.3.7.

So after 3 hours of meddling, I'm back to where I started.

I figure that my problems arose because I was using an outdated rooting guide.

What are people using to root the SGS2s these days? 

A link to a good XDA thread or a blogpost would be greatly appreciated. I can't differentiate between good and bad on XDA without help yet.

My main goal not the root, but ICS. I know I can install the ICS firmware directly. Has anyone tried that?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This kind of gets into the dirty details of things, but OPs explanation was only conceptual. The ONLY real interaction (that causes any sort of net transfer of energy) between the wings and the air is through friction, i.e. viscosity. No viscosity, no lift. 

The idea is Viscosity - Circulation - Lift. 

There is a net loss in momentum of the air and a net force on the wing (both lift and drag), i.e. Newton's Law. Yes, the air is deflected downwards in order to generate lift,

If you integrate the pressure over the entire surface of the wing, you get a net force, which can be split into lift and drag.

Also, "Air hitting the bottom surface" of the wing is just wrong. Imagine a flat plate with flow perpendicular to it. Air is hitting the bottom surface in all glory, but lift is infact zero (all the force is drag).

<TEXT> Pedantic note: Faster air doesn't "lead" to static pressure. Low static pressure and high velocity are equivalent in a flow. One is not the cause of the other.

Lift is generated by circulation and circulation alone. Your explanation is kind of incorrect in the sense that it does not explain why lift would be zero in an inviscid flow.

Places itself upon my head.

<TEXT> Okay, that's just boolean logic (propositional?). Does not apply to axiomatic systems of proofs at all. I don't know the semantics of logic, really, but I meant the way of thought that we use in mathematical proofs. And transitivity (a = b and b = c  = a = c) is something that is not assumed in logic, but has to be proved.

The theory of vaccines, information technology and all that exist because people were willing to question everything. Which is just what I'm doing.

<TEXT> Shouldn't have brought God into the mix, sorry. I'm not worried about God at all...I just like thinking about these things.

Of course circularity is useless. When you have a circular proof with no way around it, it means you have an assumption you cannot prove. And that was what I was asking -- whether the Scientific method is such an assumption. It seems it is, for now at least. 

Which is not a bad thing at all. We have to start consistent thought somewhere :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah, this was exactly the kind of answer I was looking for!

But see ... you're using the method of proof by contradiction to demonstrate that E - mc2 = 0. And that method derives from the axioms of Math, which in turn are derived as hypotheses from the Scientific Method. I would love to see an axiomatic math researcher's (if that's what they're called) comments on this :D

Occam's razor as fundamental law makes sense I guess.

So it's an axiom...which leads to an interesting quandary whether you choose the axiom of Occam's Razor or whether you choose the axiom of God.

While I will always choose Occam's Razor because everything I do rests on it, I can't really tell a religious guy not to do it because half of everything he does rests on the assumption of God :-/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> No. God is an extra axiom that you would need in addition to the axioms of Science. 

Basically, God is not a necessary assumption you need to make to explain anything in the observable universe (yet), so God doesn't exist. That's the way I've understood it. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Question </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-03-31 15:07:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been thinking of this question for a while now, but have been scared to post on here because of all the hostility on here. Though my questions have nothing directly to do with God or religion (only with concepts used in arguments), so I have hope!

Before you pick up your pitchforks, atheism is my description of choice, though I find the absence of God (or his imaginary presence) has very little relevance in my life.

So, I read through the popAtheism of Dawkins and Hitchens. I went reasonably deep into the philosophies of Science etc., so here's some questions I've ended up with (If I'm stupid, tell me, but also tell me why :) ) :

1/ Is there any justification for the Scientific Method? Well, of course it works. But it doesn't really do anything outside of the scientific method. You make a hypothesis, you do experiments, you make predictions, you do experiments, and you smile if it agrees and change the hypothesis if it doesn't.

So that's a good method. But is there any way "outside" of the Scientific method to justify it? Because proving/verifying a theorem/concept using itself is pretty useless.  

So any prediction made using the Scientific method is a validation of the hypothesis, not of the Scientific method itself.

Right? Or do I have something wrong somewhere?

2/ Occam's razor: This for me, was the strongest proof of the non-existence of God. Still pretty strong. Have a question about it:

So, Occam's razor says that given two hypotheses explaining the same set of observations/phenomena, you choose the one that makes fewer assumptions.

My question is: Isn't the Occam's razor itself an assumption?!

Of course, it IS certainly a **reasonable** assumption (far more reasonable than God) with a **valid** (in my mind) probabilistic justification (fewer assumptions means fewer ways of being wrong).

BUT: The justification itself depends on probability, which depends on the choice of mathematical axioms, which depends back on Occam's razor. Circular!

Is there something wrong with my logic? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry if this question is stupid: 

I have a Motorola Bravo (very obscure phone) and linux and little patience -- a combination that has led to many attempts, all unsuccessful, at rooting.

Though this has got me wondering: Why do the carriers/manufactures make such a big deal out of rooting?

I understand that it voids your warranty, since you're messing with stuff at a low level.

But apart from that, why does it bother them so much? 

I've already paid for the phone, and am not paying any less by rooting it. I'm still paying the same amount monthly as I did before rooting the phone. 
So what's the difference to them?

It's like saying people can buy a plain t-shirt, but can't paint anything on it :-/

I'm sure there's something wrong in my logic...but can't see what.

EDIT: Well, that's cleared up...Thank you all :) Asking a question in a different time zone means you wake up to answers :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> Indian reporting as requested!

I don't see what caste has to do with slums...People of all religions, castes and creeds live in illegal slums...but since you asked about caste, here I go.

It is important to keep in mind that *different  Indians see very very, different Indias*. So reporting today in this comment is a middlish class Bangalorean (big city) who lives in a nice sheltered area. Like many houses here, we have a lady who comes to do our dishes and to clean the house. 

The caste system is still in vogue, but I would say it's going out of style in the cities. ** For everyone above a certain economic class.** 

The servants (maids, cooks etc) are still all of lower caste (the converse is not at all true). Whether they are discriminated against or not ..... (to be continued) 

(the relationship between houses and the people who serve there are complex and involve many members of both families, exchange of gifts and the such..., it's very common for them to become extended family while still being servants)

(continued)...... it is undeniable that all of them are from the lower castes. 

So I would say (in my India), there isn't direct discrimination, but well...my mother wants me to marry someone from the same caste.

The history of the caste system provides some weak justifications for it, but as the great Ari Gold (Entourage) once said: There are no asterisks, only scoreboards.

Well, this isn't very informative. the **tl;dr** would be: There is no direct discrimination (in middlish class India in a big city), but there are a lot of conservative ideas because of which the caste system still carries import.

On the other hand, there is the issue of reservations in a lot of places for the "lower" castes...but that's a different discussion.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **tl;dr** (Very long post... so putting a tl;dr at the top and the bottom): Was getting energy back in life. Lost it all again. Help needed.

I have to admit, I have not been diagnosed as depressed. I haven't even seen a therapist yet in my life. So I'm sure my problems aren't half as serious as the problems on this subreddit. Maybe I'm just weak. 28, male, single, failure, you know the usual. In any case, I would really appreciate some help.

Much of the last year was spent in a haze or sorrow and anger, mostly over a girl. It's not an uncommon story. I liked her, wasn't confident, didn't tell her (also, she had a boyfriend) and so traveled to the friendzone. (EDIT to add details: Burnt my fingers with cigarettes a few times, punched many trees and walls till my knuckles swelled up and I couldn't write a few times, drank a lot of whisky...nothing extraordinary inasmuch as life goes). Told her eventually and was told I had betrayed her 

(which was true, I don't deny. I should have told her long before...but it was lack of confidence, not an intention of ... oh whatever). 

We became friends again. We're roommates too now, so sometimes (since I see her daily) things still hurt in my heart. You know, the usual.

I am also doing a PhD in what would be considered one of the top 5 universities in my field with one of the top 2 people in my field. I said all that to indicate the irony that I'm going nowhere with it. He doesn't care what I do. If I was self-motivated enough to do something about all this, it would all work out. All I need to do is sit down and work. But I don't. You know, weak...the usual.

The end of last year, I decided I would turn a new leaf and fix my life, one step at a time, however small those steps were. I told some people on this very subreddit about my brilliant idea and got a lot of encouragement, and was even told I helped one or two! I started exercising, and dressing better and walking with my back straight. It was all getting better.

Then my mom got two tumours in her spine. She had one in her brain, and was on the road to recovery (or the equivalent for brain tumours). She had survived (even lived, you could say) two years longer than the 18 months she was promised. And then two completely new guys cropped up in her spine. Now she's completely immobile. I came back home to help and now can't go back to university for useless visa issues. 

Which means I might lose my job. 

The thing is, I was okay with all of this. But today morning, I realized I've lost all energy. Completely drained. I have close friends, but I don't particularly want to talk to any of them about it, becuase I've realized they don't understand. You know, the usual.

So, please help reddit. I have no energy left to start all over again on my smallStepsTheory.

**tl;dr**: Was getting energy back in life. Lost it all again. Help needed.

<TEXT> Interesting answer. Thanks!

I'm not asking if the voltage exists in an existential way. I'm asking in the way us atheists say God doesn't exist because nothing He/She/It/Spaghetti does is measurable. 

So for the battery, the voltage has meaning ONLY when the battery is connected, i.e. when the voltage can be measured (or if it can be measured in some other way, that's fine too).  

However, before the battery is connected, the voltage is still Measurable, because I know that connecting the terminals will set up a current etc. 

I was wondering if the above two things are in fact the same, and it is meaningless to talk about the "measurability" of something without actually keeping the possibility of measuring it in mind. </TEXT>

EDIT: http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~teviet/Waves/gwave_spectrum.html They (It?) have (has?) been detected and measured...Not sure what you were trying to imply.

EDIT 2 : Okay they are still trying to measure them..sorry :) But doesn't put the spectrum on the same standing of scientific acceptability as the Higgs Boson? Something that's "supposed" to be there, but we can't see yet and will hopefully see when we experiment or else the world will fall apart?

The question is: Is there a distinction in Science between "measurable" and "measured"? Can the potential between two battery terminals, for example, be considered a physical quantity before it's measured?

<TEXT> Yeah even 2 Hz is enough for him to get the lift he requires. I used 10 Hz more out of excitement than anything else.

He's said he needs 2 KW of power for his weight, which is what the battery he's using provides.

EDIT (because I got some more free time): With 2 Hz, he'll need to run at around 6.5 m/s, which is a pretty easy sprinting speed (with weight attached). Good point though...With such heavy wings, 10 Hz would be crazy! 

EDIT 2: I saw your videos. You have to realize that this guy's ornithopter is not even close to being as impressive as the ones you've posted. This is just some guy hacking together a thing that flies. It hardly does anything new in any way. Which is why I can't understand why people are so surprised by it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are completely right...Oops! :)

Here really, L/D doesn't matter. As long as he can attain the lift, he'll get into the air. And then fall out very quickly of course, but he will still get up!

However, his wing area is 15 m^2.

Part 2 of calculations...Note that I have no problem with you being right. In fact, the way this currently is: I am assuming you're right and hoping to prove you wrong.

CL = 1.4  
L = 100 kg (Seems he has a 20 kg backpack)  
S = 18 m^2 (From his website)  
rho = 1.225    

V = sqrt(100 * 9.8 * 2 / (1.225 * 18 * 1.4) ) = 7.96 m/s


So, now the question is if 7.96 m/s is possible. It means you run 100 m in 12.5 s. That is unfortunately extremely fast, but not unattainably so. All he needs to get in the air is maintain that speed for 2 s. Then flap hard enough.....not convincing

In any case, I guess the tide is currently in your favour. 

I got some hope based on a WIRED article ([http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/01/humans-with-bird-wings/](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/01/humans-with-bird-wings/)) 

But that article says nothing, really.

So, for now without further information (and even though he flew clumsily and came down pretty quickly), I have to say you must be right, though there is still hope for the man :)


************ BUT WAIT!!! ******************

(Sorry for getting excited. I generally get that way when I get a sudden realization of what I was doing wrong) 
EDIT! : I made a mistake. Flapping CL doesn't depend only on V, it also depends on the flapping speed itself!!! 

Phew. I knew I was making a mistake.

So, let's say he runs at 6 m/s. And flaps at 10 Hz (10 times per second). The average speed (which on the back of an envelope can be assumed to be acting over the whole wing. Of course, the root won't move at all and the tip will move much faster) of up and down motion will be 10 Hz * 5 m (half span)/2 = 25 m/s.  There's my answer...

So the net speed the wing will see will be sqrt(6^2 + 25^2) which is far greater than what is required to get him in the air with a CL of 1.4. In fact, even with a CL of 1, he will still be able to get off the ground.

His low L/D of course, will bring him back down pretty quickly, which is what happened (he couldn't even fly for 10 s).

So I am convinced that his flight is CERTAINLY aerodynamically possible. 

Thanks for your observations...Because of them, I do think these calculations are correct now :)

<TEXT> Ah, that's better.

I don't see why it's impossible. You have a good point there about the lift. Maybe you're right... Let's calculate see what CL is required. 

Lif = mass * gravity = 80 kg * 9.8  
Wing area = 10 m^2 (say 10 m span and 1 m chord)  
rho = 1.225 kg/m^3

Now let's find out what CL you need to have to get a running speed of say 12 mph  -- a speed that shouldn't be hard to attain with significant weight on your back.

So,  

CL = m * g / (0.5 * rho * S * V^2)  
     = 4.45

A CL of 4.45 is not high for a flapping airfoil (This one is in fact a nicely cambered airfoil cross section) since it generates generates lift both through unsteady and steady effects. 

See Fig 2 on page 4 of ([http://web.mst.edu/~isaac/AIAA-2006-0450.pdf:](http://web.mst.edu/~isaac/AIAA-2006-0450.pdf). 

The frequency there is about 2 flaps per second at it gets to a CL of 3 which is in fact certainly lower than for the guy, since he's flapping at a higher frequency. His Reynolds number is also higher than for the paper, which would mean CL is in fact higher than the paper).

So, back of envelope calculations support the dutch guy. 

An L/D of 4 is certainly not high. Gliders have (L/D)max of up to 60. A Boeing 747 has one of 17.  But those are designed for high L/Ds (so is his wing probably, but let's not give him the benefit of doubt just yet). 

A flat plate moving at an angle of attack of 5 degrees (no unsteady effects, so the value I get here will be conservative) has an L/D of approximately 5! (using the formulae in[ http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/kiteincl.html](http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/kiteincl.html))

So L/D of 4 is achievable too. In any case, I'm sure his drag was pretty high, which is why he came down so quickly.

So I guess your apprehensions are answered. I had fun doing the calculations :)

I mean, look at the guy. He flew for maybe 100 m and then came back down. It's not particularly impressive. But it's certainly not impossible.

A different thread on reddit however, talks about inconsistencies in the video (pixels and what not). Now, my specialty is aerodynamics, so I cannot comment on that :D

EDIT: Made a mistake in the calculations (didn't convert from mph to m/s) </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're not crazy, but it's probably not fake. Some common arguments against it:

1. Human power is not sufficient for this: The aircraft if NOT human powered. A wii controller picks up his motions , passes through an Android phone which does the processing to give similar motion to the wings. 

2. Flat wings can't generate lift/Up-down wing motion can't generate lift: The motion is not up-down. The wing is not flat. The cross section is an airfoil designed and the wing is designed with spars and ribs just like any model aircraft.

It required some digging and reliance on Google translate on the man's dutch website to get the above information.

So, you're not crazy, but it's not fake. It's also not that impressive. The thing basically is just an ornithopter that is getting it's control input from a human.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had been waiting a long time for someone to teach me to use the weights and bars in the gym. I have always been more of a running+stretching kind of guy.

So two days ago, I met a friend with whom I worked out for an hour. We did squats, bench presses and bicep/tricep stuff with dumbbells. 

Today, my left shoulder (the place where the shoulder becomes the arm) is hurting quite badly. While I attribute this of course, to bad form, I am not sure which of those exercises caused this...Any help would be appreciated, thank you1 </TEXT>

I was doing 3 miles in 25 minutes, and now (three months later), I do 5 in 35, and this was without any training program or even a goal, whatsoever.

I'm sure that with a structured program, you will do great. For your distances, I would recommend reading training programs for reducing times for 2000 m and 1000 m races. Programs with slow days, distance days and fast days seem to work best.

Good luck! </TEXT>

2. Texts aren't received/sent randomly. This happens often enough to cause me pain. Especially bad is when I'm texting and the phone is switching from Wifi to 3G or the other way.

3. No texting without 3G.

I am male and 27... Can't afford (monetarily at least) to think about therapy or medication yet as a graduate student, but basically wasted away most of the last 1.5 years in a haze. 

It's still not easy though. On bad weather days (as [Stephen Fry](http://www.lettersofnote.com/2009/10/it-will-be-sunny-one-day.html) calls them), it's not easy at all for me to believe that this system will work. But I try to believe him and wait for it to pass.

<TEXT> I was/am in the same boat as you. 

But I have realized that things can get slightly better if you start accepting "slightly better" as an option.

And "slightly" is really really slightly. I thought I would clean my room, I didn't. I thought: Fuck the room, let me clean my table. I didn't. Eventually I settled for buying $3 bin from Walmart and dumping stuff from the table into it. So the table looks clean now.

Tomorrow, I will make my bed. The table will get dirty again. I'll put it in the bin again.

I guess what I'm trying to say is don't try to force yourself to take a step if you don't feel like it. Keep reducing the size of the step till you can actually take it. 

This is getting long and maybe irrelevant, but a friend and I were discussing motivation today: We realized we have come to be depressed because we expected the sky from our lives and were not motivated enough to actually do anything to get there. While we have had this discussion many times before, today was particularly enlightening since we also realized that while not doing anything to reach the sky, we had actually dug a deep hole for ourselves into the ground and jumped in.

So now, we have to first put in effort to reach the ground. Before that, we have to accept that we are at the bottom of a pit. Then, we climb one step out. Which for me meant exercise half an hour every two days. When I couldn't do that, I exercised 15 minutes every two days. Now I'm upto half an hour every day. Eventually, I'll be happy. That's the hope.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think I have said somewhere else on this reddit before that there are two schools of Yoga. Well, there are many, but there are two major schools that come to mind on reading the article:

1. The "modern" school - They believe that the final pose is what matters in Yoga. Props like ropes, stools and weights are used to get people to the final pose. This is why it is so painful. This is also why it is good for some people who are already physically ready for it.
2. The "classical" school based on Patanjali's teachings - [Patanjali](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pata%C3%B1jali) is a guy who lived long ago and happened to organize all the teachings of Yoga upto the point into "Sutras". His idea was that the main purpose of Yoga is to lead up to ultimate peace of mind and oneness with the body (and well..the spirit - whatever that is). The asanas are just routes to this. With this second route, most of what the article says falls flat and this is what I have been taught, though I am sure the first method has its own advantages.

One that is completely absent in Western teaching: The guru/teacher has to teach each student individually based on his/her physical and mental abilities and the student in turn places complete trust in the teacher.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I took up writing and exercise. Sad and lonely makes for good poems that you hate when you write them, but look better later (much later, as in months or years) when you look back and maybe edit them.

Exercise is well...exercise. It's what I do to make the rest of the day slightly brighter. 

I think what makes you think video games are wasted time is that you have nothing to show for it after the act. But you can look at it one of two ways: It doesn't matter, or if it matters, do something that lets you create or that leaves something with your mind after it's over. 

Like poetry or art or music or woodwork or photography or rock climbing or hiking. Those are random examples, of course. 

Though none of this will make you better immediately. That (I believe) is a gradual transformation. Doing things will get you stage where you can look at yourself without the self-deprecation that is so normal for people like us. Then, you can start working on being better. At least, that is what I believe and I working towards. I hope you can come along with me on this journey.

Which is more than most of the world can say for itself. With this honesty and your apparent will to follow your dreams, I am sure you will do great at whatever you finally settle into.

The world sucks and the girl I love is fucking someone else? It's okay. I just turn the other cheek and let the world slap me there. I am a loser and by definition, losers don't win. That's okay too.

As long as I can exercise regularly, everything else doesn't matter. The hope is that once I'm able to exercise regularly, I can take the next step. And some days, I can't get out of my bed. That's fine too. I'll just let those days go by and wait for the day I get out and go to gym.

The point is the hope, of course. Exercise gives me endorphins and for all I know, the endorphins might be what's letting me live.

I post to r/Fitness and get encouragement from there. I see stories on reddit and I laugh. 

I'm not sure what I'm trying to say to you any more. But I went through all that you did. Maybe not or maybe my situation was worse, we can never be sure. But remember it does not matter that others think of you as a failure. 

I am afraid sometimes that my family will see me for what I am and their hopes will come crashing down. But these days, I have learned to accept that too. I am what I am. This acceptance sometimes make me smile and sometimes it makes me punch walls. 

But whatever I am, I will exercise regularly and then sleep well, and then dress well. And then we'll see. Fuck everything else.

I'm not sure I'm getting my point across at all, but I hope your understanding is better than my expression. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have two questions...I'm not exactly new to r/Fitness, but this seems to be the thread where I can ask basic questions freely!

1. I used to be a competitive runner about 6 years back in school (400 m, 800 m, 2000 m and 5000 m), but then I stopped. I started again a few weeks back. I run 3 times a week, 3-5 miles in each run, with an average pace of 7:30 per mile (8 mph). 

The problem is that my knees are hurting. I've just attributed it to not running for a long time, but the pain hasn't gone in 3 weeks. Is this normal or should I be worried?

2. I see squats being recommended over and over. But I don't have a partner and I am not confident of my squatting form. Will I get the same advantages if I use the squatting machine at the gym?

I'm a grad student in university, so have access to good equipment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My mother is a yoga teacher, and I've heard her talk about this:

There are two different schools of Yoga (I'm not sure what either is called, so I won't take names):

1. Stretch as much as you can - This means go only to the extent you feel slight tension in and then hold that pose. Don't push yourself. You'll eventually get to the point where your heels are on the ground. 
2. Use "props" - This could be a something under your heels so that they are resting. Maybe a pillow. Anything.

I don't know for myself which is better. My mom teaches yoga the first way, so that's how I do it. You'll get better at Yoga the more you do it. </TEXT>

Start with simple things and keep expanding. I used to cook once a week, and now I cook almost daily and keep trying new things. Of course, I don't make anything that takes longer than 20-30 minutes, but there's a whole world of cooking hidden in that time frame too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> About the reason for eating this way: I really have never considered health. My mother is a dietitian in India. She's strictly vegetarian for religious reasons, but allowed us (my brother and me) to eat eggs because she realized as sportsmen, we would not get enough protein otherwise. Come to think of it, she also used to give us Vitamin B-12 capsules regularly. She also did tell me recently that for the amount of lentils and beans we eat (approx 0.5 cups per day) plus the beans and the eggs, she was making sure that we got enough protein as kids. 

While I was not religious at all, vegetarianism stuck with me mainly out of inertia. 

When I went to Singapore once, I was out with friends and had steak and loved it. So I plunged headlong into meatland with gleeful abandon!

However, I am also a poor graduate student. So, I don't eat out very often (i.e. I cook at home) and I don't know enough about cooking meat. And meat is more expensive in grocery stores, so vegetarian it is. I started working out in earnest recently and hence this thread!

Though as I write this, I am having delicious prosciutto with fresh mozzarella and basil.

Sorry for the long reply...Am a little drunk and happy with  my cooking!

Also, thank you for the advice on supplements! I will buy some whey protein next time I visit a grocery store! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, I'm looking it up...

Look at this article: http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/you-illuminated/201102/does-vegetarianism-make-you-dumber

Though this is about memory...Seems Creatine does not help memory in omnivores, but increases it in vegetarians! Crazy shit!

EDIT: And a similar trend for bodybuilding/exercise: http://www.vrg.org/journal/vj2003issue4/vj2003issue4weight.htm

"Vegetarians have lower levels of creatine in their blood, urine, and red blood cells.21,18 This does not necessarily mean that they have lower levels in skeletal muscle, which is where it most matters during exercise. In one study, vegetarians and meat-eaters took 7 g of creatine three times a day for six days. The vegetarians' power output over three bouts of exercise improved significantly after the six days of supplementation, while it did not change for the meat-eaters.18 In another study of vegetarians, creatine supplementation did not improve power output.22

Generally, a daily total of 20-30 g of creatine, broken up in smaller doses over the course of a day and taken for five to six days, has been shown to increase performance.17 There appears to be no benefit of taking this dose for longer than six days.17 After the initial "loading" phase, 2 g/day maintains creatine levels for at least one month.17 Some researchers suggest taking creatine only every other month to maximize its effects.10" </TEXT>

<TITLE> Question about diet -- Vegetarian vs non-vegetarian </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-12-23 20:58:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am mostly vegetarian. By mostly, I mean I eat meat only once in a while, maybe once a week and I was completely vegetarian till a year back.

I am also Indian, which for my diet means I eat a lot of vegetables, lentils and rice. I was always told my required protein comes from lentils and eggs. So I assumed I had everything required for a healthy life from a vegetarian diet.

Looking at some threads on this subreddit however, has given me the impression that I still might need supplements.

Vitamin B-12? I'd never even thought about that before, though someone said milk which I get enough of, I'm sure.

Is there anything else I should be worried about, especially since I started exercising regularly and reasonably intensely (mainly running 5 miles, rowing 2000 m and some dumbbell exercises 3-4 times a week)?

<TEXT> Was talking to my friend in Miami who has a motorbike and complaining that I really wanted one. She said we should do a motorcycle trip. 

So in 3 days, I rented a motorcycle from Chicago, rode to the Smokies and back alone. I didn't have a jacket and I didn't have glasses (for the first seven hours before i finally gave up and bought a $5 pair at a gas station). She and friends rode from Miami and we met at the Smokies and did "The Tail of the Dragon".

My eyes were red, my skin first chilled to the bone and then burned and chapped. Best trip :D

<TEXT> Are you currently a backpacker?

Yes. But never longer than 2-3 days.

 Do you know how to use your equipment well and repair it if needed?

I can use it, but can't repair it.

 Do you know basic first aid, especially for blisters?

Nope :) I guess my preparation has to point in a different way!  

Great advice on the rucksacks walks. I've done lots of hikes with heavy weights, but never trained. This is a good time to start, then.

<TITLE> Please criticize and improve my new fitness regime </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-11-03 00:52:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My goal is to stay healthy, and fit enough to do the Appalachian Trail in 4 months two years from now. However, I have very little knowledge of the Science of fitness and my regime is based only on personal experience of the following:

1. Playing sports all my life (Soccer mainly). I was a competitive swimmer as a kid and a member of my collegiate athletics team in India (long distance)
2. Yoga. My mother is a yoga teacher and I learnt the basics (only) from her.

This is my new fitness regime. Please criticize freely! I alternate days because I was told I should not do the same exercises on consecutive days.

** Days 1,3,5 : **
 
1/ Run 4-6 miles (It's been 6 years since I've run, so I run at the slow pace of about 8:30 per mile)

2/ Row 2000 m (in about 10 minutes) 

3/ If I feel like it, I swim a little and pay a visit to the sauna.

4/ Stretch. 

**Days 2,4,6 :** 

1/ Yoga for stretching (about 20 minutes). 

2/ Push ups (I am currently on 60 in sets of 12-15) 

3/ Sit-ups (On 70 in sets of 12-16).

Then I repeat. I use runkeeper and android apps for the pushups/situps. That's about it. Like I posted before, I have never really used gym or machines before, so any suggestions, help will be greatly appreciated!

<TEXT> I've grown up doing a variety of athletic activities and exercises, but I never really had access to a gym. 

Now I do, and what I want to know is this: 

What advantage the machines in the gym (and weights) offer over say push-ups, sit-ups and pull-ups, which I regularly do anyway. They do look like fun and I see that a lot of people are really into it, which must mean there's solid reasons for it!

Well, some of are funny, of course. But most of them seem like real first world problems to me. Is it just the fact that they're not problems in the "third" world that makes them funny? Because when I face the problem (like going to pee when I'm already asleep on a comfortable bed), I don't laugh at the fact that I didn't think this was a problem before, because it is one now! </TEXT>

That if you sat in the bath tub  
Long enough  
With the shower on in full force  


Hot water  
Slowly turning cold  


Your feelings  
All those crazy thoughts  
Would run down  
Your body  


And drain themselves  
With the water  


You would think that  
Wouldnt you?  


But let me tell you  
What really happens  


The water comes  
Hits you  
And then it goes  

  
Well, its water,  
What did you expect?  


Your feelings  
They stay where they are  
After the water is cold  
And you turn off the shower  


Youre the same as before  
Slightly cleaner maybe  
But the same.

If what you meant that any drummer can play the Beatles songs, then I agree with you. But the band drummer also comes up with the grooves and beats...I think Ringo was a perfect fit for them

Covering her mouth

The edges of her lips  
Showed themselves  
From behind her knuckles  
And curled up  
Into a smile

<TEXT> It supposedly works by taking many pics at once with varying degrees of focus, kind of like a compound eye. I wonder if it can zoom. 

Since there are so many mini-lenses, resolution is supposedly a problem. Hopefully they can work that out. 

Awesome concept, really! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh the Bengal ones sacrifice lots of animals. In the nepal animal sacrifice (which was recently banned, thankfully), thousands of animals are sacrificed at once.

Some of our customs have us cutting a pumpkin and putting red powder in them. This is nothing but a euphemized (okay that's not a word supposedly, but please let it pass) version of animal sacrifice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, you're right of course :) 

However, it's also important that we don't really have a religious text. Some say the vedas are it (Sanathana Dharma), some say the Bhagavad gita is it (ISKCON), some say there's no text and we're awesome because of it (the moderate ones)....EDIT: To add, there are even some that say that we are not even a religion, only a way of life.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because the facilities suck at all levels. I was in my undergrad team and we had a coach who didn't really care (he wasn't paid much at all, to be fair). Even then, when we once played against a "professional" (equivalent of the third division in other countries) club, we had better uniforms than them. They came to the field by public transport.

There's no money going into soccer. Two of the top clubs in the Indian subcontinent -- Mahindra United and JCT, disbanded recently because of a lack of money. LINK: http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110621/jsp/sports/story_14140274.jsp

And course there's the famous story of the Indian soccer team not going to the world cup because no one sponsored shoes for them. They qualified by default though.

<TEXT> Oh the caste system exists and is alive and well. People marry in the same caste. People kill for caste. People look away for caste. People get reservations for caste. People get votes for caste. Like you say, the exceptions (us, probably?) don't make the rules

And there are brahmins who eat meat religiously too (fish eaters in the coastal regions), though I agree, they are a minority. I'm a brahmin and I'm vegetarian :)

The morning is blue

There's a knot in my stomach

I'm thinking of you


There's no sense in this

The torture, the pain

There's no question if it's worth it

Because I have nothing else

To be worth anything



In my head

I'm fading out

Losing meaning

Each day

I am less than I was

The day before

<TEXT> Hey, 

Sorry for the late reply, but I would totally be up for next semester. I have an electronic drumkit since I live in an apartment..

I am into pretty much everything, from metal to pop and a little bit of hip hop. These days, I'm listening to a lot of jazz and reggae though I haven't really played anything like it. 
 
Really, any kind of music will do. I just want to actually play with people instead of the computer.

1. The hottest youtube video I've ever seen: [Hot youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs8YthlglKk)

2. An AMA with an astronaut: [Astronaut AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gm8rh/iaman_astronaut_who_has_been_to_space_twice_and/)

So the two most important things in life for me were in the same place at the same time...Couldn't ask for much more in a day!

However, when I reread it, I saw that the paragraphs weren't really adding anything in the sense that everything I wanted to say, I was still saying, so I let it be.

I'm no poet though and I don't know the rules. I just press Enter when I feel a pause in my thoughts to start a new line :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> On the sand

By Michigan Lake

And in the forest

By the sand

I thought

Of holding your hand

And walking with you

Instead of beside


After I moved a log

To make way for the queen

I buried my hands

In my sweatshirt

And played with

The lighter



Yes, the same lighter

That refused

To light our cigarettes

And robbed me of that moment

Where I would be sitting with you

Smoking by the lake

Listening to the clamour of the waves




In the curiously romantic

Silence of winter brown trees

I burned your

Stuffed monkeys tail

And felt the

Pleasant distraction

Of the heat on my palm.



You stopped

In your tracks

To look for the wolf



I looked at you

And lit the flame

on my palm again
