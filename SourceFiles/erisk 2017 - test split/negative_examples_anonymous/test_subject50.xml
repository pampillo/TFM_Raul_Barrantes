<TEXT> Windows 8 keeps having hiccups on a relatively new HT-PC. By hiccups, I mean that the icons seem to overlap but not function and  switching between windows is problematic. If I restart Explorer in task manager, everything goes back to normal. The specs are: AMD A10, 8 GB RAM, 4TB storage. I'm running it at an odd resolution on my TV, not sure exactly what, slightly less than 720P through HDMI. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, they don't "procreate" as we experience it. This is part of why it's difficult to classify them as alive or dead. They increase in number, like something alive,, but require a host to make the copies for them, unlike something that is alive. In this way they are somewhat like parasites, except those usually increase in number through their own means and just use the host for nutrients or some other way that benefits the parasite. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I had the same adviser for undergrad and graduate school and went straight through to get my PhD in Biosystems Engineering. In undergrad I told him I wanted to get a PhD and was open to both options. When I got into grad school I told him that I was more interested in working in industry. We worked a lot with industry. In fact, they were our primary funding source for most, if not all, the time I was in grad school.

He always tried to steer me a bit towards academia, but I always told him, and my committee, that I was more interested in industry. We actually spent a fair amount of time talking about it, which was very valuable. One of my professors spent a large portion of his career in industry and then moved back to academia when he was older and I'd say he's one of the better professors for having that experience.

One thing to keep in mind is that while publications don't necessarily matter in industry, getting them in grad school does matter to industry (if that's the track you take. I had a friend to an MS in aerospace that never published and it was totally fine because he did a big design project or something). The thing is, it's a good experience, IMO, to have some less than random person who is supposed to be anonymous rip through something you've worked on for months-years in an attempt to make it better.

Now, when it came time to graduate last August, you can bet your ass I was looking at Academic Keys for a PostDoc position as much as I was looking for a job through Indeed.com, BMES, etc. I ended up getting a research/development job in industry that, so far, has turned out quite well. Everyone told me "Remember where you came from," when I told them (I also moved 1800 miles), but also congratulations. I think being open with them about what you hope to do is going to benefit you because if the professor(s) have been around for a little while, they've had a student with similar, if not identical thoughts. </TEXT>

As an example person: when I was an RA in my undergrad, we had a girl who was usually in a wheel chair, but we would occasionally see her walking around (mostly just the building) with the elbow supported braces. Once she decided to walk to the Student Union. Not far by healthy individual standards, like a 2-3 minute walk. We had to call medical services to have someone pick her up/take her scooter to her because she was so exhausted by the trip she couldn't get up.
This would have helped her a lot, especially when she over exerted herself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, it doesn't. If, for example, an army base has no walls or security than another army base, but people are trying to get into the other army base more often, it does not mean the first base is more secure. It means that fewer people want to get in. While that does mean a lower chance of being compromised, as you say, that does not mean more secure.

More secure means that if there is an attack, or whatever, you can block it and not be compromised. Maybe that's through being more difficult to infiltrate or some other method, but a simple lack of attacks does not mean more secure </TEXT>

Also, based on the current model of people buying stuff they wouldn't get as much money, because more people won't buy a cheaper product (according to them). The same exact number will, cause that makes sense based on price. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry, this is long, but here goes:

Recent grad here, just finished my PhD in Biosystems Engineering and found a job in industry (on the other side of the country, it's snowing. It's not supposed to snow in March.)

Anyway, I probably had a very different graduate school experience than you are having, but let me tell you about what I do. During my undergraduate time I started working with my advisor (academic) and told him I was more interested in working in industry than academia. I continued to work for him as an undergraduate for about 2 years before getting my BS. I was planning to go to graduate school. That was always part of the plan.

The work I ended up doing in his lab my senior year ended up carrying into my graduate degree and that helped me get through it a little quicker. My first year I had some crazy hours. Shitty pay, that never improved. One calendar year I received a full graduate student in engineering stipend. After that year, I settled into a rhythm a bit and got started on a new project. Which was good, as I was over the one that had carried on from undergrad.

After about 2 years on that project I was fucking done with it too. It was going nowhere. Another guy in my lab had been working on something similar for about a year before I started and his seemed to work better (from a fundamentals thing as I was working the alternative design). Finally we got enough data (we thought) to publish mine and that would represent my 3rd paper (I'm leaving one out because it was a side project that ended up working really well.) My committee decided I should graduate in the middle of June and I defended at the end of July. July sucked. A lot. All during this my advisor was very results oriented. He knew we got paid for 20 hours. He didn't care if it took us 10 hours a week of work to get something done if the results were real and what we were hoping for. Sitting around reading meaningless papers is a waste of time

I eventually found a job while working on some random stuff in my lab and helping them move from one building to the next. I was lucky, my advisor was willing and able to pay me.

The new job, me in a totally different climate, going from hot as balls to cold as fuck has been very different for me. There still are proposals, but your role in that can be as much or as little in the writing process as you want. Backing up a little, I work for a small company now that relies largely on SBIR grants and that sort of thing. The goal is to use one or more of these to get something that works to market and sell infinity and drop the mic. It scares me a little (scared me moving 1800 miles) but they're attached to a slightly larger company that's been more stable as they've been around for 30+ years. Now, at my new company, I'm expected to work 40 hours per week. Not 9-5 or whatever, just 2 weeks that average 40 hours. I have a ton of flexibility with my schedule. Meetings are expensive, especially when there are 7 PhDs present.

A few things to keep in mind:
Your advisor sounds crazy. I have a friend in BME who has an advisor a bit like yours (mostly with the random fucking e-mails). Basically you have to get across to him that you plan to do what he asks, in a reasonable time frame. Him expecting you to have work done at 11 that he asked about at 9 on a Sunday is not a reasonable time frame. If it were a weekday, sure, maybe.
2-3 meetings a day is incredibly inefficient. Do everything you can to cut that back to like once per week for 2 hours if necessary.
Why do you feel the need to keep the same hours as him? He gets paid a lot more than you do. You get paid for 20 hours/week (usually). Keep that in mind. Also keep in mind that you need to get your work done to graduate, BUT without killing/burning yourself out.
In my experiences working with PhDs from industry (we got more industry backed funding than anything else), you get a bit of both worlds. You have some who absolutely dont take their work home and some who obsess over it. Both are successful.

TL;DR: Post academia can be pretty much what you want it. I had a reasonable advisor and managed to find a job that gives me flexible scheduling. Your advisors an asshat who doesnt know how to manage people. 

Start looking for a job now. Dont necessarily tell him cause he might freak out

Also, not knowing your major, you don't always need to read the whole article to understand what they're claiming and how they did it. This is a big time saver.

Also, organize your stuff. Whether it's Mendeley (my favorite), Endnote, ReadCube, or another program, don't just have a folder on your desktop or documents folder with PDFs floating around. You'll never be able to find anything or you'll take too much time organizing it for it to be effective. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I worked with the base uPrint model in grad school and we went off the service plan and there were a ton of issues. I replaced the print head, the chamber fans, the tips (this is more of a they need it eventually thing), and I've even taken the print head off and put it in an oven to get support material that leaked to soften enough so I could hit it with a hammer while it cooled so the thing would switch between the two heads.

When they work, they work great. When they don't, they're awful.

The thing that happened at the base is surprisingly common I would say. Also, the base plates are reusable. Completely. You can either dissolve the material off or take a chisel to it (carefully) and any material will pop off. </TEXT>

<TITLE> 3D Printer for wax and ABS/PLA </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After spending lots of time on here (and time elsewhere such as Google) I've come up with nothing. 

I'm looking for a 3D printer that can print in wax and ABS/PLA (not necessarily at the same time and not necessarily both ABS/PLA) for work. I know there are printers that will do one or the other, but I haven't found anything. I think the closest has been one of Stratasys's printers but those are ridiculously expensive and my experience in Graduate school left me jaded (Dimension uPrint).

Any help would be much appreciated </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's a link to the abstract for anyone who wants it. I haven't been able to read the article yet, but will be doing so sometime today:

http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/7/273/273re1

Edit: Ok, so I read through the paper and it is interesting, and it does work quite well, but I'm a bit concerned that they're using 1 L of blood as their sample. The tests were compared with traditional tests and found results of sensitivity and specificity that ranged from 100%-77% and 91%-82%.

It seems like a good platform, and yes, current tests today may be less than $34 each, but the start up costs and training are what are the problems IMO. They also said that after clinical trials they were able to improve sensitivity by increasing the antibody spotting concentration on the gold nanoparticles, but that seems kind of obvious. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Knowing people who did it and paid for more than I did (I had auto insurance/cell phone covered by parents cause it was convenient and didn't cost them much extra) it's quite possible.  Basically make your own food as much as possible and avoid going out, don't get TV; stick with Netflix, avoid movie theaters.  Traveling is kind of out of the picture, except maybe once per year as is new technology.

Also, live somewhere cheap.  I lived in Tucson where the $15K-$25K stipend is enough. If you pick a place like New York, it won't be and that'll be difficult. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my experience with 3D printed materials, the layers are not laid down perfectly flat on one another and there is a capillary force that pulls liquids through (this applies to FDM, I have no experience with other technologies).  It's possible that if the plastic was heated a little bit closer to being in a liquid state rather than closer to being in a solid state as it is laid down that this might solve the problem, but then things might get runny. 

Also that there is a scaffold interior instead of a solid material isn't going to help with the out gassing problem (I'm assuming you mean the gas in the interior of the part is coming out of the part not the material itself is off gassing). Perhaps if a part was printed solidly it would be less noticeable as the space would be filled with material. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So this seems to be kind of an odd problem that is currently driving me crazy.  Basically what happened is that my school (university) converted all student email accounts to the Gmail based ones that are great and last forever.  When I graduated, I was hired temporarily by my adviser while I hunted for a job.  Because of this, my email account was converted to a Microsoft Exchange account.  This means I log into an Outlook Web App to check my email instead of going through the Gmail login.  On my phone, I can't add the new account as an exchange account because it makes a duplicate.  Now I have to use multiple email clients on my phone despite there now being support for Exchange.

The reason I don't just delete the account now that I have a job and don't use it much is that I have all my purchases, subscription (All Access) and that sort of stuff tied to the old Gmail account that I used from my university.  

Is there any way to have the account on my phone, but get the Exchange emails (which may or may not go back to the Gmail account, no one seems able to tell me)? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Having a good friend who spent a year trying to find a job after getting a BS in Ag   Biosystems and then an MS in BME, probably not, go for the full PhD.  However, the BME program at my school has a habit of kicking out PhD students who are "under qualified," "problematic," or that they "just don't like" making the MS degree relatively worthless here.

On the bright side, my friend is now studying for a PhD with full funding in Barcelona, Spain.  

The best advice either of us would give you is to not do something too specific.  Do not pigeonhole yourself into a technique that is so specialized and useful in only one way that you're a grain of salt in a pile of sand looking for the other grain of salt. </TEXT>

If you want to do prosthetics, find a professor at a different university and consider the field that his/her appointment is in (whether it's EE, ME, BME, etc).

The two things you mention are very different, so you may want to decide on smart prosthetics (going to be more EE and ME oriented) or the medical substances (probably more BME or material science engineering). </TEXT>
