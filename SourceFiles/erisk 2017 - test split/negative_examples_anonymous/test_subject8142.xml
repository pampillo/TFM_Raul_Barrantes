<TEXT> [Baseball actually has much more parity than the NFL, in spite of the salary cap.](http://espn.go.com/mlb/blog/_/name/stark_jayson/id/8908029/mlb-more-parity-nfl) I won't try to make a direct comparison in terms of teams making the playoffs with the NBA, because it's too hard to compare a league where over half the teams make the playoffs, but 12 of the last 15 championships have been won by the Spurs, Lakers and Heat, with the 3 that weren't still having one of those 3 teams making the finals. The Heat also beat the Spurs in the finals last year, so it had 2 of those teams. The 15 years prior to that only had 5 different champions, which brings us to the beginning of the NBA's salary cap era. We've actually only had 7 champions in the 30 years of a salary cap. In comparison, MLB has had 19 in that same time span. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In fairness, tuition also has a lot more it has to pay for as well. In 1938, you had to pay for basically teachers, chalkboards, a few administrators, and people to take care of grounds and buildings. Now, you have to pay for all the technology, which also means you have to pay all the people take care of the technology. Not to mention all the other amenities that most colleges have now like gyms, more extensive health centers, higher quality food and housing, etc that costs more. Yes tuition is rising at an extremely high rate. But so is the cost of what is being provided for students. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wouldn't put us as a top 3 job. The tradition is great, and depending on the recruit and/or their parents, the quality of education can be a huge boon. On the other hand, for a school with as much success as we've had, there's a lot of recruits we can't even attempt to go after, because they won't be able to get in. Not only that, we don't have any "athlete majors" where athletes can slack off and do nothing. Combine that with needing to recruit much more nationally, I still think it's a great job, probably top 10 or so, but not top 3 by any stretch. </TEXT>

Guy was going through a girl's closet at 4 in the morning wearing nothing but a blue shirt.

A guy was exposing himself while on a bicycle, the logistics of which both confuse and impress me to this day.

Two girls woke up in the middle of the night to see a man in their dorm room. Upon them waking up, he left out the window. This was further explained to me by someone in their dorm, who told me they lived on the 2nd or 3rd floor. Apparently it went about 12 hours before it was reported, because they both assumed it was a dream. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Lout Holtz approach. A few years ago Lou was talking about how Weis would have an easier time coaching when we played at BC because he was used to playing in the Boston area and his mind would be right. He then said he always felt like if he got to coach at William and Mary while he was coach at ND, he would have coached a great game. One of the other guys called him out on it and said yeah and they would have had a Heisman caliber QB and been favored by 30 points according to you. No one could talk up Army or Purdue like Lou Holtz. </TEXT>

The only option is Lionel Tyrone Willingham.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of the things KLM said that I feel needs to be clarified is that Tommy wasn't getting booed last year when he came into games. There were boos, yes, but those were at Kelly, for what was perceived as giving up on Golson. We'd just seen Dayne Crist removed after a half the year before, we wanted Kelly to give someone else a shot. Tommy Rees for the last 2 years felt like a crutch for Kelly. A nice safe QB that can get 7-9 wins on a decent team. Those aren't the seasons we play for though. As a student body, at least, there's been nothing but respect for Tommy Rees. Do people wish we had a better QB, absolutely, but that doesn't take away anything that he accomplishes. He's part of the ND family, and nothing's going to change that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the ACC is better fit. We don't want to be on such an extreme end of any votes that come down to private vs public universities. The ACC is almost tied depending on how you want to count Pitt. And academically they're pretty similar. Yes we like playing UM, MSU, and Purdue from the B1G, but the ACC does have BC, Miami, and Pitt. I also feel like for nonfootball sports it's at least a toss up, if not leaning toward the ACC. We do love our lax. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly you're probably going to be worse off. If you've only unlocked champions you like you've probably played those ones more, meaning you're better with them. If you have too many you're not going to be good with any of them. And even if you did get more, if you're only good with a few it doesn't matter about the others.

Also if you play ARAM (All Random, All Middle) having more champions is a big disadvantage.

<TEXT> I had a friend who thought that you couldn't have sex during the day. That's why we had visiting hours between 9am and midnight for our dorms. What confused me most is that on weekends visiting hours didn't end until 2. Apparently she switched schools a few times in high school and managed to miss sex ed entirely. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I kind of agree with you. My opinion is Buffy would have better individual episodes. I think there are a lot of Buffy episodes that are better than pretty much any Angel episode on an episode by episode basis. But Angel had way better overall storyline and plot arcs. I felt like Angel was actually building somewhere, especially since it had a consistent enemy throughout the show. Plus obviously the redemption story for everyone in the show was great. I feel like Angel just got much deeper. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a Catholic brother as the rector of my dorm in college. He had been in rehab the semester before I got there for alcoholism. He was absolutely oustanding, for the record, the entire time I was there. I imagine the loneliness is part of it. I think for him at least, a big part of it was the temptation was there all the time. It's got to be a lot harder to stay sober when you see college kids getting drunk on a tuesday. That said, it also made his talks about the dangers of alcohol and alcoholism a lot more powerful. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We'd had problems for a while, and had always had fights over really dumb stuff. She was clingy and had a distinct lack of trust. She'd accuse me of cheating even though I was spending all my free time with her (apparently those group project I had were made up so I could go hook up with other girls). These were all exacerbated by distance when she graduated and I had a year left.

The straw that broke the camel's back, however, was a game of League of Legends. We would play together a fair amount. She was a pretty inconsistent player, though, so she'd have some pretty bad games. League's community being what it is, she'd get yelled at sometimes in game. Finally, after being told to stop feeding and eventually to uninstall, she quit in the middle of the game and within a week it was basically over. And that is how League of Legends ended my relationship. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tie between two people. One would be Chris Stevens. Grew up in foster homes. Ends up being good enough at basketball to get a scholarship to Notre Dame. Plays on the team that stops UCLA's 88 game win streak. After school goes to play in Europe for a year before working for Proctor and Gamble and then running a Budweiser distributor. Finally gets tired of that and helps to found Keurig. After having done that for a while he's retired now and just funds interesting projects and is now teaching at Notre Dame.

The other would be Alasdair MacIntyre.  He's one of the most highly regarded philosophers in the world and incredibly interesting to listen to. </TEXT>

Everyone stands around a table. There's a bunch of cups with about as much beer as you'd used for pong or flip cup, and one that's all the way full for the last person. 2 people are playing at once. It usually starts with people on opposite sides of the table. The goal is to bounce a ping pong ball into your cup. If you do that, you pass to your left. If you make it on your first try, you can pass it anywhere. If the person to your right manages to make one before you do, they slap your cup of the way, pass their cup to the person on your left, and you have to drink a new one. It goes until the last cup gets finished, and that person is the loser. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah Sampson got a few guys likes Gordon, but a huge issue was that for most part his guys weren't serious about basketball. He was essentially running a program like Blue Mountain State. The only guys who weren't getting stoned and drunk all the time his last year were Gordon and White, which is part of the reason neither came back. And why a lot of the guys in state weren't considering it.

Side note, posts like these just remind me of how much talent the state produces. I think half my high school's losses while I was there were to nba lottery picks. </TEXT>

After he graduated, this wonderful human being enrolled in seminary, but then I ran into him at a bar later and learned he dropped out because "celibacy sucks". He is one of 2 people to have fired in probably the last 6 or 7 years, the other being a student manager who gave out tequila shots to students in the basement. Another was almost fired for dealing to full time staff, but he got arrested first. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Debt can even be good if you can invest the money toward something with a higher rate than the interest you're paying. If I'm paying say 4% interest on my house and I have extra money after monthly payments, I could use that money to pay off extra money on my mortgage. However, given that the market tends to average somewhere between 8 and 12% in a year that's not a crash, you're usually better off investing that money elsewhere. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll agree with you on that first one. We have an assload of bandwagon fans. That's pretty much what leads to all of those other 3. We get preferential treatment because we have a lot of fans so our games = ratings and people will go to them as well. It's that combined with the fact that we have a fair amount of wealthy alumni, so they'll pay to go. 3 comes mostly from the bandwagon fans. Most alumni and students have the most pessimistic views of ND. As for 4, there's no reason for us to join financially so why should we? That comes from the first 2. </TEXT>

This was coupled with the fact that we can't have anyone of the opposite sex in our dorms between midnight and 9 on weeknights and 2 and 9 on weekends.

<TEXT> I've got a few.

My freshman roommate tried to give the head nod to Jimmy Clausen. Clausen shook his head at him.

Was in a seminar with our punter, Ben Turk. On several occasions the professor just called him punter. His text message noise was also "Where the white women at?" from Blazing saddles.

Used to play basketball with some of the football players at the gym. As the biggest guy in our group who played some center in middle school, I always got stuck guarding the linemen. The worst was Kapron Lewis-Moore. Dude had over 100 pounds and about 3 inches in height on me. I've never had to box out harder in my life.

My favorite story is of a friend of mine though. She's from Spain, so she doesn't really follow football, even as a Notre Dame student. But she was in a fairly small major, and Eric Olsen, our center, was also in that major. She was leaving class with him one day when they run into one of Olsen's friends. He tells her it's his friend Mike. She asks if he's on the football team, and he says yes. Then she asks what position he plays. Dude just looks at Olsen and asks if she's for real. Olsen has to apologize and say she's from Spain. Mike was Michael Floyd. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's hilarious. I've been waiting for something to come out because I knew he wasn't actually dating her. He was dating someone else at the time. He even just called her a friend early on I believe. This probably led to less shock when it all came out. Though I'd never have guessed she didn't exist. I'm pretty sure he was in on it to some degree due to rumblings I've heard, but to what I'm not sure.

As for ND fans in general, the student body seems to be pretty skeptical of him, the rest of the fan base who doesn't know him as well is pretty much buying his story entirely.

<TEXT> Once it had happened, I thought they handled the Declan case well. My bigger issue is it never should have happened.

For Lizzy Seeberg, obviously what happened to her is terrible. However, non-rape sexual assaults are incredibly difficult to prosecute. It all comes down to he said she said. In this case, there were inconsistencies between even what she said versus her friends. This all makes it really difficult to do anything about. I'l agree that the non-athlete friend was a complete dumbass and should have been punished for what he did assuming they could get a consensus he did it. </TEXT>
