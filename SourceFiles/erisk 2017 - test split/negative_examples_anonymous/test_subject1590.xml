<TEXT> I think this is a really good offer, tbh. Their valuation is at 4MM, which means they've probably raised a seed round of ~1MM (my guess), and they are willing to offer 100k + bonus. This is a really good sign.

Equity wise, I think 1.7% for the 10th hire is also very very decent. </TEXT>

APM466 - Luis Seco's tests follow his notes online, while his lectures are basically like blah blah blah, so you certainly can skip one hour. He usually starts like around 9:20 anyway.

<TEXT> But Olympics are slightly different right? FIFA WC is played in a number of cities, and for a country like Germany, they have many high end stadiums for their league games already, so that's not a problem at all. But for Olympics, it's all in one city and there are a lot of different sports (so a lot more stadiums are needed in a more concentrated area). Does that make a difference? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe you are right, but I'd argue that there are very few names that get remembered over time (this is not to say Villa is bad).

Just consider Spain alone, in the past 10 years or so, I'd say Xavi, Iniesta, Casillas, Raul are bigger names than him (not comparing skills here, just saying these names are more well-known), and probably Puyol, Ramos are at his level. There you've got 7 or 8 names already for that decade, so in 50 years basically there would be 40 or so players of, roughly speaking, his level or better. I doubt anyone could remember 40 names from one country (even if it's your country) unless if something special happened that made you remember him.

And plus, people tend to remember more recent players and forget old ones. How many players from the 1960s can you name? </TEXT>

If we are taking about legend as in someone who is, at some point, one of the best players for a top country/club, then I think he is.

17. If you hear a voice within you saying you are not a painter then by all means paint and that voice will be silenced. -- Vincent Van Gogh

18. You are to set your own value, communicate that value to the world, and then not settle for less. Sound daunting? Thats just because it takes you out of your comfort zone.

<TITLE> ELI5: How does contango and backwardation affect non-commodity futures? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-08 15:26:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am reading about contango and backwardation. Essential, if I am understanding correctly, contango is when t futures price (or forward price) of a commodity is higher than the expected price today. So basically, does that mean if the price of some commodity stays constant, the price of their futures will still drop because of contango?

How does this affect non-commodity futures such as VIX futures? Do they suffer from contango as well? If so, does that mean the price of VIX futures will drop even if the VIX index remains constant for a period of time?

And finally, what futures are examples of backwardation?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> The traits of a great Startup Adisvor </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-30 19:23:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Original Source: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/traits-great-startup-advisor-mark-macleod

The two things I love to do most are advise founders   their teams plus close complex financial transactions. I love those things so much that I created SurePath Capital Partners so that I could do them all day long! Its been just over two months now since I launched SurePath and its going better than I ever imagined. As Ive settled into this new role, Ive been thinking about what it means to be a great Startup advisor. Here are my thoughts.

Its very common for startups to add advisors. Those advisors come in all shapes and sizes. Most advise on the side while they do something else. That can lead to inconsistent experiences. Ironically, the more prominent that person is, the more disappointing the experience is. With rare exceptions, if you have some A list startup celeb advising you, you might get some great intros, but they will be too busy being their fabulous selves to really engage.

Another common pitfall with advisors is signing up the person with one big win. Often that persons advice consists of telling you what worked at that big win. But you cant just copy. The context is different every time.

In my humble and completely biased opinion, here are the traits that I think the best startup advisors needs to have:

Broad   diverse experience: Its only from going through multiple companies, winners, losers, down markets and upmarkets that you can be a great advisor in good times and bad. You need multiple data points, and the pattern-matching ability that only comes through being in the trenches for a long time.

Client orientation: I began my career in public accounting and spent 6 years in professional services. I grew up career-wise having clients. Whether you started off in consulting or some other services industry or whether service is just a core value, this client orientation is must if you want to offer great advice.

An important aspect of a client orientation is that its never about the advisor! I have listened to prominent, twitter famous advisors blather on incessantly because they love the sound of their voice. Thats just painful. No matter how experienced you are, it should never be about you. Its always about the client.

Objective: The best advisors have no personal agenda. They simply help you sort through the issues and offer up unbiased thoughts and answers. This is a common criticism I hear from founders regarding investors. Its not that they dont trust their investors. But they are aware that while their investors bring great advice and experience, they also manage a fund and have to deliver returns. That can sometimes compromise objectivity.

Another element of objectivity is not getting caught up in the drama. Startups are full of highs and lows. Often in the same day. The best advisors are sympathetic to that but dont get caught up in that themselves.

Solutions first: Its not all that valuable to raise issues or problems without also offering up potential solutions. The last thing a founder needs is more unsolved problems.

Anticipation: If you have deep experience and you have a client first orientation, youre likely going to think of issues and opportunities before your client does. Thats magic.

Coach: The most prominent tech advisor is Bill Campbell, who is known as the Coach. He was a football coach before going on to coach Steve Jobs, Marc Andreessen, Ben Horowitz and many other prominent execs. The thing with coaches (vs. advisors) is they help you arrive at the answer yourself rather than just tell you the answer. That is so powerful.

So, thats my recipe for a great advisor. Am I missing anything? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Question 1: Do you think Greece will remain in the EU given its growing concern of defaulting?

I've created a poll to help tally up opinions. Please vote http://thearima.com/questions/do-you-think-greece-will-remain-in-the-eu-given-its-growing-concern-of-defaulting.

My personal guess this some sort of bailout will be reached at the end (as that's what has always happened). Greece will remain in the EU.

Question 2: Will you adjust your investment strategies in the next few days/weeks according?

I bought some VIX etfs last week, and have happily enjoyed my 30% gain today. Given my answer to the first question (i.e. they will stay in the EU), I would likely clearly out my position in the next few days as I think the VIX index will rise a bit more and then go back down.

I'd love to hear your thoughts! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't necessarily think machine learning requires ODE specifically, but I think it's always good to learn some things other than what you will need. ODE (and later on PDE) is very useful for many modelling related problem and is particularly useful for financial problems. I think it's always good to learn a course on that.

BTW, I think in stochastic processes you will need some ODE, and stochastic analysis is used in machine learning. </TEXT>

2) Wages will all be at $11.25 (when you start), some department will add an extra $1 or $2 on top of it.

3) I worked at the Alumni Relations office at Rotman when I was in my 3rd year. It was great, fun and you get to know a lot of alums who do interesting things.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 1.   Your team is everything.
2.   Solve a problem you are passionate about.
3.   Never outsource your core competency.
4.   Be cheap lean but dont be afraid to spend.
5.   Chase the vision, not the money.
6.   Never eat lunch alone. Always be closing.
7.   Ideas are worth sh*t. Execution is key.
8.   Dont take momentum for granted.
9.   Learn to monetize from the get-go. [cue Notorious BIG - Get Money]
10. Set S.M.A.R.T. goals.
11. Focus. Its easy to get carried away with multiple projects.
12. Stay uncomfortable.
13. Be metrics driven. You cant improve what you cant measure.
14. Not everything your customers want is what they need. Learn to read between the lines to really get at the problem.
15. Consistently seek out constructive feedback.
16. Know your competitive advantage and stay obsessed over your competitors and the industry.
17. Be a thought leader in the space.
18. Move quickly.
19. Talk is cheap. Deliver instead.
20. Focus on customer service. Word of mouth is the easiest form of marketing.
21. Make something that you know people want.
22. Place a premium on aptitude versus experience.
23. Learn to say no (respectfully).
24. Trust your gut.
25. If things aren't working, ask yourself why and change that. ( This sounds simple. Eh ? Still most of the people don't do )
26. Hire people smarter than you. ;)
27. As a founder, you set the tone for others. Dont forget that.
28. Don't be afraid to ask for help!
29. Make deliberate decisions.
30. Dont lose sight of close friends and family. You dont need to be a hermit just because you work a lot.
31. Dont micro-manage.
32. Start with why? 
33. Bring out the greatness in those around you.
34. It's better to own a smaller piece of a bigger pie than a bigger piece of a smaller pie.
35. Be humble.
36. Utilize your calendar and tasks to the max.
37. Tackle your most daunting tasks in the morning. Save the easier stuff for later. ( this simple habit has helped me a lot )
38. Read often. ( Plenty of online and offline quality content are available. I would recommend a book : $100 start up )
39. Workout at least 4 times a week. Body and mind are one. Oh yeah, and get your sleep too. ( Yoga, Cardio and Light body weight exercises are sufficient. You don't need to spend on a gym )
40. Be authentic and transparent. ( May not give the result immediately. It helps in long run )
41. You will hit hurdles, push through and get ready for the next. Stay optimistic.
42. Ask questions. 
43. Nobody should have a personal office. Open floor plans allow best for collaboration.
44. You have 2 ears and 1 mouth. You should listen more than you talk.
45. Culture is crucial. Your employees should want to stay late and hangout.
46. Sell value, not products. 
47. Always have an attorney glance over any legal documents. Speaking of, document everything so there is a record for all parties.
48. There is no such thing a 'part-time entrepreneur.' :)
49. Learn to move on if youve exhausted all efforts. Be honest with yourself.
50. Have fun!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's exactly what I am asking here.

It is possible to fill in the missing values with averages, it's also possible to even throw all entries with missing values out (due to the nature of the problem - we are not looking into making a prediction for every company, just pick out the better ones). I guess what I should ask is if there are methods that can handle missing values (i.e. the classifier implicitly deals with them). I think trees is such a type, although I am not terribly sure. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Edit 1: The scenario is the following:

A venture capital firm would like to predict which companies are interesting based on some stats like money raised to date, the industry they are in, # of employees, etc. And they get this information from 3 online databases. In some of the companies available on the databases, information are missing. My guess would be they are missing because the firm is small or has been inactive for a period time, and hence not updates. </TEXT>

I would suggest talk to people about it. Speak with your family, friends, and talk to people online. One advice I'd give you is don't be afraid that people will steal your idea, because they won't. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not the worst since it's not part of your so-to-say core courses, but still failing a course does not make your transcript look good.

I am assuming what you are taking is MAT223 (correct me if I am wrong), and since this course usually does not curve students, I'd recommend speaking with your instructor immediately and explain your situation to him/her (e.g. I don't come from math and am taking the course for my own curiosity, I need to go to grad school for reasons xyz, blah blah blah). Sometimes this will help because the instructor is often a student (grad) himself, so they have some sympathy for students (not always true though) and maybe would bump up your mark by a few points. I'd also recommend seeing him in person (prepare your speech) instead of sending emails.

Other than that, not much I can suggest. Perhaps take some easy courses to make up for your GPA if you failed or did badly. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Beyond Money, How Much Support Should VCs Give Startups? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-24 01:35:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In the New Yorkers cover story profile, Marc Andreeseen talked about how he and Ben Horowitz are building a different kind of venture capital business.

One of the key elements is offering services to startups within A16zs portfolio beyond money. This approach involves 65 in-house specialists focused on executive talent, tech talent, market development, corporate development, and marketing.

We give our founders the networking superpower, hyper-accelerating someone into a fully functional C.E.O. in five years, Andreessen said.

It got me thinking about whether VCs should be providing services to startups, rather than simply giving them money, advice and, theoretically, networking opportunities. Should VCs serve as service agencies that can proactively meet the needs of portfolio companies directly or indirectly?

Many startup entrepreneurs, particularly first-timers, are smart, but they dont know what they dont know. They may be excellent developers or engineers, but they have limited knowledge or expertise about areas such as sales, marketing, finance or hiring.

To be successful, startups need to make the right decisions about multiple things and hire the right people. Some of their hires will be external  consultants, contractors, part-timers, interns, etc.

The question is how do startups make sure they attract the best talent to drive growth? They could spend time searching for good fits through research, asking their networks for advice, or simply hiring their friends (a common HR tactic).

But perhaps a better approach is having their VC become a one-stop HR destination for whatever a startup needs. Some of these services could be delivered by in-house specialists, while other services could come from a roster of strategic partners.

This could be a more efficient and effective way for startups to operate while VCs would achieve two goals: ensure their startups are making the right decisions to achieve their goals, and delivering value.

For better-financed VCs, it may be financially viable to have in-house expertise. For other VCs, it could involve building a roster of partners with a variety of skills. These partners would not only be hired guns but could be tapped for their expertise in other, non-formal ways  e.g. coffee, phone calls, etc. This would create a success-driven ecosystem that would eliminate some of the operational challenges facing startups.

What do you think? What role should VCs play to ensure the success of their startup investments? Are VCs about capital and advice, or should they be more pro-active?

More: Here are some other thoughts on whether VCs should provide additional services:
 Openview Venture Partners Kyle Lacy on why it makes sense for VCs to provide value-added services
 Vidyards Michael Litt on the importance of selecting the right VC.

<TEXT> Someone was sharing on LinkedIn and I thought it's interesting for data scientists.

1. Data is never clean
2. You will spend most of your time cleaning and preparing data.
3. 95% of the tasks do not require deep learning.
4. 90% of cases GLM will do the trick.
5. Big Data is just a tool.
6. You should embrace the Bayesian approach.
7. No one cares how you did it.
8. Academia and business are two different worlds.
9. Presentation is key - be a master of PowerPoint.
10. All models are wrong, but some are useful.
11. There is no full automated data science. You need to get your hands dirty. </TEXT>

sometimes a case could be investigated by both the police   the university (e.g. campus police). The university investigation only determines if you get to stay in the school. It does not replace police investigation, nor does it imply the police won't look it anymore. </TEXT>

Start with designing your website (which I assume you will need one, and will be attracting most of your customers online), and then give the idea a go. You can probably get a business number (say as a partnership first) and start operating your business. If you get a lot of users, then move on to registering. Don't wait time on incorporating/insurance/lawyers unless if you are planning to raise money. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Thirty concise thoughts about building startups </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-25 04:10:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 1. Building Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) is easy. Knowing which assumptions to validate is not.

2. Nailing an MVP fast involves a certain degree of luck. It takes time to find the right distribution channels.

3. Learning to code is not essential, but its important and helpful when you cant hire/find technical talent.

4. Entrepreneurship is learning to live in a constant state of uncertainty. Yes, endless doubts every single day.

5. A great MVP is finding people like yourself and build/ join a community around that interest.

6. The success of a product can be highly dependent on its design at the first stages of a startup.

7. Great design comes with great understanding of a problem. How it works not how it looks Jobss motto, is what matters.

8. Arrogance kills you and your relationships. Then your startup dies.

9. Learning curves are underestimated. A lot of time in startups goes into learning how to do new things you ignored and cant hire people to do.

10. Motivation is hard. Keeping your team motivated comes from you being motivated. Startups dont run on cash only but on morale too.

11. Startups are creative organizations that might turn into businesses one day. Many startup investors think they invest in the latter.

12. Build something for yourself is dangerous advice, you risk building something only you want. It is fun though.

13. Finding liquidity in startups is hard. Its almost unethical to take money from friends, fools and family without product market fit.

14. San Francisco can be the cheapest city on earth for a startup founder. The benefit-cost ratio when meeting the right people is extremely high.

15. Rejection, not failure, is the default state of startups (from market, family and investors). Its not personal, do not mix emotions with business.

16. Building a company is not the same as managing a company. In the beginning, the most important thing is managing yourself.

17. Leadership is a daily decision. Doing what you say, setting the example and inspiring others is what matters.

18. Mixing hobbies and passion with work can backfire. Money pressure can take the beauty out of anything. Mastering the balance is an art.

19. There are no startup experts. Every startup is related to the uniqueness of their founders. Be wary of startup experts.

20. The best startup pieces of advice Ive found are stories from other founders. Taking the best out of them and learning is a continuous challenge.

21. Starting a startup is a gamble. The more educated the gamble the better. Its important to know the history of your industry.

22. Networking is most effective when you can bring value to the network. Most people just want to extract value.

23. Focus on your strengths is a luxury for startups. Its the biggest excuse not to do something youre startup needs because you ignore how to do it.

24. Venture capital is helpful but can be addictive. Its hurtful when you dont have it and think you need it.

25. Being delusional kills startups. Most founders are delusional. Meditation helps.

26. Capital does not precede success, it works the other way around.

27. Try not to spend a week without talking or listening to people who are successful at what they do.

28. Almost every design fault or bug can be fixed with great customer service.

29. If you want to become something hang out with people who are already that something.

30. If you want an audience be part of the audience first.

<TITLE> 50 Inspiring Quotes on How to Start a Company From Scratch </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-17 16:12:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 1. "Accessing capital to start a business can be a daunting process, especially for entrepreneurs who start out with a great idea but have no real familiarity with the business world." --Gavin Newsom, lieutenant governor of California

2. "I can't help thinking if she--the director of a government agency--is this ignorant about what funding is available and where the money comes from--how often lower-level bureaucrats must give wrong answers when people are looking for help to start a business." --Matthew Lesko, author of Free Government Money

3. "You read a book from beginning to end. You run a business the opposite way. You start with the end, and then you do everything you must to reach it." --Harold S. Geneen, president of ITT Corporation

4. "Timing, perseverance, and 10 years of trying will eventually make you look like an overnight success." --Biz Stone, co-founder of Twitter

5. "I never get the accountants in before I start up a business. It's done on gut feeling, especially if I can see that they are taking the mickey out of the consumer." --Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Group

6. "No matter what your reason for wanting to start your own business, developing the foundation is the same. Laying a solid foundation for your business will provide you with a road map to follow as you build your business. As you work through the Start a Business Step-by-Step Workbook, you will define the company's mission, decide what business entity is right for your business, name your business, determine the pricing for your products or services, formulate your financial projections, define your competitors, survey consumers regarding your products or services, determine the marketing methods right for your business, and more." --Jeanne A. Estes, author of Start a Business Step-by-Step Workbook

7. "Patience, drive, and very little fear." --Jake Nickell, the owner of Threadless.com, describing what it takes to start a company

8. "The problem is that many entrepreneurs start with good intentions to create a new mindset system but then slack off. The solution is to make that system part of your daily routine." --Lisa A. Mininni, president of ExcellerateAssociates.com

9. "When the need to succeed is as bad as the need to breathe, then you'll be successful." --Eric Thomas, The Grind Coach

10. "In order to be a success in business, there is one thing you must do. You cannot be successful without it. That is work. I have not told you anything new. Everyone knows that you cannot be successful in anything without work. Why doesn't everyone work? Because some lack the one thing that makes men want to work: enthusiasm. That is something no one can give you. You must acquire it yourself, and the only way that you can become enthusiastic about anything is to have a thorough knowledge of it. You have never seen an enthusiastic man who was lazy." --Thomas J. Watson, CEO of IBM

11. "Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work." --Thomas Edison, inventor

12. "I'm convinced that about half of what separates the successful entrepreneurs from the nonsuccessful ones is pure perseverance." --Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple

13. "Openly share and talk to people about your idea. Use their lack of interest or doubt to fuel your motivation to make it happen." --Todd Garland, founder of BuySellAds.com

14. "Success and profitability are outcomes of focusing on customers and employees, not objectives." --Jack Ma, founder and chairman of Alibaba Group

15. "Grow with discipline. Balance intuition with rigor. Innovate around the core. Don't embrace the status quo." --Howard Schultz, CEO and chairman of Starbucks

16. "You have to have more leadership, less management. It's about getting stuff done. You can sit around and analyze things forever, but while you do that the competition has moved on." --Peter Vesterbacka, creator of Angry Birds

17. "You have to be ready for hard work and frugal spending to get the idea off the ground." --Garrett Camp, founder of Expa, Uber, and StumbleUpon

18. "I believe that this is the age of the entrepreneur, and as job security has increasingly become a thing of the past, we have no choice but to become self-reliant. Small business is the foundation of growth in America, and it starts with one person, with one vision." --Gary Bredow, host and creator of The Start Up Show

19. "For me, the most fun is change or growth. There are definitely elements of both that I like. Launching a business is kind of like a motorboat: You can go very quickly and turn fast." --Tony Hsieh, CEO of Zappos

20. "Your reputation is more important than your paycheck, and your integrity is worth more than your career." --Angelo Sotira, co-founder of DeviantArt

21. "There is only one boss: the customer. And he can fire everybody in the company, from the chairman on down, simply by spending his money somewhere else." --Sam Walton, founder of Walmart and Sam's Club

22. "Recessions are the best time to start a company. Companies fail. Others hold back capital. If you are willing to do the preparation and work, it is the best time to invest in yourself and start a business." --Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks

23. "The critical ingredient is getting off your butt and doing something. It's as simple as that. A lot of people have ideas, but there are few who decide to do something about them now. Not tomorrow. Not next week. But today. The true entrepreneur is a doer, not a dreamer." --Nolan Bushnell, founder of Atari

24. "A business model that hasn't been tried before is always interesting, even if it's likely to fail." --Michael Arrington, co-founder of TechCrunch

25. "You have chosen the wrong path if it's not fun. And you are probably not taking enough risk if it's not hard and rocky sometimes." --Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce

26. "Running a startup is like being punched in the face repeatedly, but working for a large company is like being waterboarded." --Paul Graham, co-founder of Viaweb

27. "Embrace what you don't know, especially in the beginning, because what you don't know can become your greatest asset. It ensures that you will absolutely be doing things different from everybody else." --Sara Blakely, founder of Spanx

28. "What do you need to start a business? Three simple things: Know your product better than anyone. Know your customer, and have a burning desire to succeed." --Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's

29. "It's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day hard work of running a business and completely forget that, while solving problems and building something you can be proud of, you also have an incredible opportunity to shape the future. Even better, you have the chance to meet amazing people and do amazing things along the way. It's important not to get lost among the trees and forget about the amazing, beautiful forest you're planting." --Colin Wright, author

30. "Starting your own business is like riding a roller coaster. There are highs and lows, and every turn you take is another twist. The lows are really low, but the highs can be really high. You have to be strong, keep your stomach tight, and ride along with the roller coaster that you started." --Lindsay Manseau, photographer

31. "You need to be surrounded by good advisers, but you also need to trust your instinct." --Chris Hughes, co-founder of Facebook

32. "Don't limit yourself. Many people limit themselves to what they think they can do. You can go as far as your mind lets you. What you believe, remember, you can achieve." --Mary Kay Ash, founder of Mary Kay Cosmetics

33. "Follow the cream of the crop in your area of online expertise and learn from them. Network with them." --Mark Forrester, director and producer

34. "Don't take too much advice. Most people who have a lot of advice to give--with a few exceptions--generalize whatever they did. Don't overanalyze everything. I myself have been guilty of overthinking problems. Just build things and find out if they work." --Ben Silbermann, co-founder of Pinterest

35. "Execution really shapes whether your company takes off or not. A lot of people start out with an exciting thing and they want to take over the world, but really the people who do take over the world have a good plan of how to get there and the steps along the way." --Pete Cashmore, founder of Mashable

36. "Be a user of your own product. Make it better based on your own desires. But don't trick yourself into thinking you are the user." --Evan Williams, former CEO of Twitter

37. "You just have to pay attention to what people need and what has not been done." --Russell Simmons, co-founder of Def Jam Records

38. "Whatever you do, be different. That was the advice my mother gave me, and I can't think of better advice for an entrepreneur. If you're different, you will stand out." --Anita Roddick, founder of The Body Shop

39. "I think it's very important that whatever you're trying to make or sell or teach has to be basically good. A bad product and you know what? You won't be here in 10 years." --Martha Stewart, founder of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia

40. "The one thing that I think is critical in the entrepreneurial spirit is that it's all attitude. If you think you can, then you're half way there. If you say, 'I can't,' then you're defeated." --Debbi Fields, founder of Mrs. Fields Cookies

41. "An entrepreneur tends to bite off a little more than he can chew, hoping he'll quickly learn how to chew it." --Roy Ash, co-founder of Litton

42. "The very first company I started failed with a great bang. The second one failed a little bit less, but still failed. The third one, you know, proper failed, but it was kind of OK. I recovered quickly. Number four almost didn't fail. It still didn't really feel great, but it did OK. Number five was PayPal." --Max Levchin, co-founder of Affirm

43. "It's harder, but we're still finding oil in Oklahoma today. The bar has been raised on startup companies, but it can still be done. Every regulation and every rule limits you, but, yes, it can still be done. That's the beauty of living in a free country and having the freedom to have an idea and become an entrepreneur." --Harold Hamm, CEO of Continental Resources

44. "It's hard to tell with these internet startups if they're really interested in building companies or if they're just interested in the money. I can tell you, though: If they don't really want to build a company, they won't luck into it. That's because it's so hard that if you don't have a passion, you'll give up." --Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple

45. "I love what the Valley does. I love company building. I love startups. I love technology companies. I love new technology. I love this process of invention. Being able to participate in that as a founder and a product creator, or as an investor or a board member, I just find that hugely satisfying." --Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape

46. "Entrepreneurs always pitch their idea as 'the X of Y,' so this is going to be 'the Microsoft of food.' And yet disruptive innovations usually don't have that character. Most of the time, if something seems like a good idea, it probably isn't." --Eric Ries, Silicon Valley entrepreneur

47. "Libraries function as crucial technology hubs, not merely for free Web access, but for those who need computer training and assistance. Library business centers help support entrepreneurship and retraining." --Scott Turow, author and lawyer

48. "President Obama's view of a free economy is to send your money to his friends. My vision for a free enterprise economy is to return entrepreneurship and genius and creativity to the American people!" --Mitt Romney, politician

49. "Free enterprise empowers entrepreneurs who have ideas and imagination, investors who take risks, and workers who hone their skills and offer their labor." --Paul Ryan, politician

50. "The great fear that hung over the business community in the 1970s was death by regulation, and the great goal of the conservative movement, as it rose to triumph in the 1980s, was to remove that threat--to keep OSHA, the EPA, and the FTC from choking off entrepreneurship with their infernal meddling in the marketplace." --Thomas Frank, political analyst

<TITLE> Startups Anonymous: 38 Things Every Startup Founder Should Know </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-14 20:05:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> At my age (Im 38), Im not claiming to know everything (or to be an expert in anything for that matter), but I do believe Ive learned a few things. As I approach my 40s, I thought Id share the lessons (sometimes hard) that Ive learnedand earned:

1. Nobody cares about what you say, only what you do.
2. Funding is not the end, only the beginning.
3. Once you take on funding, the stress gets worse, not better.
4. Dont beg for investment dollars. Theyre paying to be your partner, not the other way around.
5. Arrogant and disrespectful investors will never be good partners. Ignore them.
6. Never, ever, ever, pay to pitch.
7. TechCrunch is overrated. Unless you sell to startups, it doesnt do shit. Its good for the ego though.
8. Some people only care about people who they think are popular. Theyll only acknowledge you when you appear to be more connected then they are. Get rid of these people.
9. Some people only like you for what you can do for them. Pay them no mind.
10. Accelerators are only good for funding and meeting new friends. Is that what 6-8% equity is worth to you?
11. Take a job if you have to. You will not lose your will to be an entrepreneur for doing so.
12. Take huge risks in your 20s. Take calculated risks in your 30s.
13. If you have an idea that keeps you up at night, do something with it. If not, it will always only be a dream.
14. Its okay to be driven by money at first. Once you have it, youll find your true motivation.
15. Non-techies: If your tech cofounder says its going to take three months or more, theyre lying.
16. If your tech cofounder says they cant use existing code, cut ties immediately.
17. If your non-tech founder says they cant sell X until you build Y, theyre making excuses for not working.
18. Sales are everything. Nothing else matter. Nothing.
19. Learn something new every day. One thing at least.
20. Even if you dont publish it.
21. Marketing isnt luck, its hustle.
22. Press isnt magic, its hustle.
23. Always partner up, never partner down.
24. Do something uncomfortable as often as you can.
25. Failing is part of growing. Very little of what you do is actually going to work, embrace it.
26. .coms are still the best domain you can get. Its probably worth the price.
27. Things are never as bad as you imagine them to be.
28. It doesnt matter where your startup resides. Its only you that care.
29. Tech conferences are a waste of time, but fun.
30. Working all night is unnecessary. In fact, its detrimental.
31. Work/life balance it a real thing and necessary to succeed.
32. Dont wait until you succeed to start your family.
33. Stay competitive.
34. Talk to your customers every day.
35. Help every entrepreneur that you can.
36. Take every speaking opportunity that youve been offered.
37. ASCAlways stay curious.
38. Exude confidence and success. It translates.

What lessons would you add to the list?

<TITLE> Traction - how should we (a consumer internet startup) find our early adopters and initial userbase? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-23 02:02:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been working on a site called Arima (http://arima.io) with a team for a few months now. We have built a pretty decent product (I think) and we are just in the initial stage of gaining traction (public released in 10 days ago). We get about 30 or so users a day.

Let me begin by describing what our startup does. We are a Q A site for mass opinion. Basically, unlike most Q A sites, where responders can freely enter text (which becomes difficult to browse once you get a lot of answers), we focus on multiple choice and numerical responses, and help you tally up answers so that it is easy to see what the mass think. We also try to get you some in-depth analysis of data, such as what people from you country/city selected or answered, their demographics information and so on. In short, think of us as Quora for Mass Opinion.

Like every consumer internet startup, we are a site requires a lot of visitors and a lot of content. For the moment, I don't know what is a good way to get initial traction. Here are some thoughts:

1) paid advertising (most obvious) - tried reddit, facebook and stumbleupon. Nothing too great at the moment.
2) Reddit - reddit has a huge userbase with a lot of users interested in this kind of stuff. I tried posting in /r/internetisbeautiful, for example, and got some traction from there. But once your post drop down to the second page you lose attention, and I am not sure how else I can utilize reddit.
3) I have a blog http://insights.arima.io where I write some articles, but again, haven't found a good way to push this out.

Please let me know what you think, and if you know any good ways to get traction, please let me know! Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is he the technical person or the business person on your team?

I suggest that you should consider some alternatives. Your partner will likely spend a lot of his time with his new internship (at least for the first few month), which means that he will have less time to focus on your project. While it is true that an internship at Google makes you look good on paper, this does not solve your current problems (i.e. build a product). His experience at Google will help you in the long run, but this does not mean anything right now. I suggest that you should consider finding another partner (perhaps keep this guy as well, but on a part time basis with less equity). </TEXT>

I suggestion is to find a technical co-founder. You can find this person thru 1) your college/university, 2) local meetup groups, 3) angelist or 4) linkedin. Find people who like to work for startups (even on a part time basis) and start from here. </TEXT>

I think this is an interesting business idea. Personally I would not use it because I don't have access to a car now, but I think some will find it helpful. I am pretty sure that there are similar services (especially apps) out there about it, have you researched? </TEXT>

<TEXT> A few things

- I think you should purchase your own domain, and get a serious hosting service (not one that puts ads on your site). These things are cheap nowadays and they really make your site professional.

- I don't like sites with black background, this could be a personal thing.

- I think you should have somethings that explain what you do (other than saying you track maintenance), e.g. a video or a faq page or some visuals. It is hard to get people to sign up for something without know what it is. For example, I'd like to know (before I sign up) how you track my much I drive and when my next maintenance date is (I think that depends on time as well as how far you drove right?). Do I submit my mileage, do you estimate it based on my driving habits, or do you track with an app? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here are my suggestions,

1) Do NOT start with writing a business plan (especially if your idea is around the internet). Not saying that they are useless (which I believe so), but your time could be used elsewhere.

2) If you have little cash, you better have someone who can code. This can be either through finding a CTO (your classmates, friends, people you find on LinkedIn, Angelist etc), or learn to code yourself (e.g. Codecademy). In these days, it's very hard to raise money from investors with just ideas. 

3) Start with building an MVP. Find a decent designer (this you will have to pay for, because you can learn coding but design you cannot learn quickly) and make your site look pretty, visual is important.

3) Go and talk to people with your MVP (once you have it done) and see what they say. Have them sign up for a beta or collect user interest. You may be able to get some investment with an MVP, and then that's when you can start hiring developers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that you should begin with testing your product among your friends and family first. Ask them if they would pay for your product or no, and if not why not. Sometimes people don't use your product because it is bad (in which case you know you need to go to work again); sometimes they don't use it because there are similar services out there which are free (in which case you can think about a free version, and then later add more features and make it premium account, like LinkedIn); and sometimes they don't use it because they don't realize its value (e.g. if you are a new product that does not exist), in this case you can consider giving a 14 days or 30 days trial. But in all cases, you should keep in mind that if you plan to charge money, don't offer it complete for free now because most people will not pay for something that was free. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have some functions of x, in the form of d* sqrt(x) or d* log(x) where d is known. I would like to rewrite (approximate is fine) them in the form a/(1 + bx^c ), where a b and c are arbitrary.

I think one way to do this is to write out the Taylor series expansion on both sides, and then try to match coefficients. Are there better ways to approach this problem? Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just my suggestion here:

Math/Probability foundations:
-Real Mathematical Analysis by Charles Pugh
-Probability: Theory and Examples by Rich Durrett
-Something on Stochastic processes would be helpful, e.g. Probability and Random Processes by Geoffrey R. Grimmett and David R. Stirzaker
-If you want to do cryptography, something in abstract algebra would be helpful, consider Algebra by Serge Lang.

For Statistics, 
You could try Theory of Statistics by Mark Schervish (a good grad book for Bayesian analysis), alternatively, you can try the classic book Theory of Point Estimation and Testing Statistical Hypotheses by Erich Lehmann.

If you're interested in machine learning, read Chris Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning or Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective by Kevin Murphy.

I am not familiar with other parts of CS other than machine learning so that's my suggestion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Including both job title and age should be okay, buy you need to make sure that the two aren't highly correlated (usually the older you are, the higher job title you have, and this is more common in some industries than others). Could try using levels 1-5, say, to code jobs, where 1 is no experience required, 2 is 1-5 yrs of exp, 3 is 5-10, 4 is 10-20 and 5 is 20+. Or can also try 1 = ordinary titles (like analysts, coordinators, etc). 2 = senior (e.g. senior analysts), 3 = manager, 4 = director and 5 = VP level or higher. This more or less corresponds to the yrs of exp. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you should first start by quantifying job titles. There are many job titles out there (which will be hard for you to fit in a model), and even the same job title can have very different salaries (e.g. a manager at a small company vs. a manager at Goldman Sachs). Perhaps years of experience is a better measure? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Machine learning is something you should definitely learn, regardless of which branch of stats you do. I suggest try to take on a few consulting projects while you are in school (even for free) and start building a profile (much like a programmer or a designer). You can try to find projects through your university - most university offer consulting services - or professors, who typically have industry connections. Another thing you can try is through LinkedIn or through Meetup. Once you get to work on a few real projects, you will be able to learn how to communicate with non-stats/business people and really understand what the industry is doing. Then ask them for references and slowly move yourself to the fields you are interested in by taking projects from those areas. </TEXT>
