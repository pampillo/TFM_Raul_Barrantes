Maintaining a space you can be comfortable in, and confident others will be comfortable in, requires effort on all fronts. A clean bathroom with an imbalance of messy living area will be off-putting; similarly, a nice living room with a dirty bathroom, kitchen, etc., will be off-putting. </TEXT>

But I guess, good job on having a marginally higher population than the second most populated metro area in your state, I guess?

PS Houston has more people than Dallas.

<TEXT> Smith is the kind of guy who needs boundaries, structure and supervision to succeed. When he went to Detroit, he went into an environment where he was given almost free reign over himself. It was easy to look at him in that situation and think, "well, here's a horse who can never be tamed, who does what he wants, who doesn't care where his hoofs land."

Yes, Smith is a wild stallion at heart; and all wild stallions can be tamed, though not everyone can tame one.

The Rockets were in the perfect situation to tame him, to put a saddle on him, and to man the reins.

For Smith to reign supreme, he needs the reins of a *team*.    </TEXT>

i mean, this thread has 260 comment versus 66 in the Cousin's stat line thread. kinda speaks for itself.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Across the board, I wouldnt Curry's numbers are head and shoulders above Westbrook or Harden's. They all are posting MVP caliber seasons purely from a statistical standpoint and they all make worthy candidates.

 I think at the end of the season, the votes are going to come down more to "what they think they did with what" - do they prefer Harden leading a challenge for the SW division title and 2nd seed with an extreme dearth of normal starter minutes logged; Westbrook with triple doubles left and right, a nasty bark and nastier bite and a taste for upset on his tongue; or Curry, putting up one of the most beautifully efficient exhibitions of guard play in ages, on one of the most dominant and successful teams the regular season has witnessed?

I think it's gonna be very close, with Harden or Curry taking it home.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Curious now what the average length of a Rockets game is vs. other teams. Can't be that substantial and Harden is a quick FT taker. I mean, the Rockets average 25 FT (4th in the league) and only take 6 more FT per game than the lowest FTA team (Knicks at 19) - so there isn't much of a spread in FTA between teams. 6 FTs take, what, an extra 3 minutes of game time? Max? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Numbers can be ~~devolving~~deceiving, however. Harden was not playing aggressively at all in the playoffs last year. He was settling for a lot of bad and contested jumpers, and he wasn't attacking the basket and doing his FT collecting like he had been for a the majority of last season and this season. So while those numbers might support the narrative that "the refs clamp down on the playoffs", I believe there are more variables at play than that.

Harden gets more FTs when he is aggressive and attacks the basket, he gets less FTs when he settles for end-of-the-shotclock contested jumpers.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> no not really, i'm actually a pretty nice and considerate guy. really just thought it was a little bit funny and while it was obviously intended to be a joke about his race, I don't think substituting chop stick for fork is anything more than casually ignorant. i mean... we all laughed at the Jeremy Lin math video, but *how dare I* make a joke involving the utensils with which his people have historically consumed food???

i do apologize if i offended anyone; that was not my intention.

(I have 2 jeremy lin action figures after all, how *could* i be racist?) </TEXT>

<TEXT> For the East, yah, pretty decent. Don't really see how that makes him the MVP though. So he has the same win % while playing as Harden and worse than Curry, while playing in the East, and somehow that is supposed to be indicative of him being the MVP?

Guess I just can't see how that logically works out into a compelling argument. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What did you think of Youth Lagoon? I credit 'The Year of Hibernation' as the catalyst for a lot of the good things that have happened in my life over the past 2 years. I was, almost exclusively, spurred into going to Outside Lands in San Francisco last August to see YL. I thought the show was great (as was the whole festival) and that trip ended up leading to an amazing group of friends, a deconstruction of my previously self-destructive social/general anxiety, and lots of fun in between.

San Antonio has 50% hispanic population verse 43% in Houston so there are a lot more Mexicans in Houston than San Antonio as well. But yeah it's because us white folks are scared of the brown invasion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry. I'll be more tactful.

At a gas station buy water, mineral water or unsweet tea for a drink and almonds or peanuts or jerky (careful as some have a lot of added sugar but it's easy to find some with minimal - which isn't a bad thing) as a snack.

You're right, it's not easy but it is simple. You just have to adjust the way you approach purchasing food. I was in the same boat and felt the same way you do, but with a little bit of foresight and willpower, it's easy to not consume heavily processed junk food. Buy fruits at the grocery store, take them with you. Buy frozen fruit (i prefer raspberries which are very low in sugar and blueberries) and [edemame](http://www.seapointfarms.com/new_products_pages/lightly-salted.html) for quick and easy snacks that are high in fiber, protein and vitamins.

Drink hot tea or black coffee. Buy chicken breast (bags of frozen chicken breasts are cheap, healthy and easy to work with). Buy seasonal vegetables. Canned tuna is extremely healthy, make a tuna salad with 0% greek yogurt, celery, and whatever else you like in it. If you have to have bread/pastas buy whole wheat with the least amount of sugars (though those carbs are broken down to sugar so even 'sugar free' bread technically has sugars).

Get a crock pot, make stews with lots of vegetables and some meat. Lentils, quinoa, black beans are great sources of fiber and protein, are cheap and are filling.

You'll find it gets easier and easier to adjust your eating and buying habits the further along you go. I consume very little food which has added sugar and it just takes a little bit of self control to get there.

Good luck and sorry if I was an asshole earlier, just trying to help out.

Lost about 80 pounds the past 18 months by adjusting my habits. Cutting out that (excess) sugar is so worth it and I hope you manage to make it a reality.

<TEXT> Hey Yao!

First I just wanted to say that I'm a huge Rockets fan and you and T-Mac were my favorite players of the 00s. It was truly a privilege watching you play, laugh, joke and be an ambassador for the sport of basketball and for your home country of China.

I've got a question about basketball and a question about your humanitarian work, I'll start with basketball.

What was your favorite moment from your career on the Rockets? My greatest memory was the playoff game against the Lakers were you went to the locker room with an apparent injury, only to emerge a bit later in the game to lead your team to the win in LA.

You've already had a successful public campaign against the consumption of shark fin, and now what will surely be a successful campaign in Africa. What will be the next big project you tackle? Will you follow in the trend of a humane approach to animal protection or do you see yourself shifting towards other projects and problems? Also, would you ever consider teaming up with Deke as two towers of humanitarian work?

Thanks for using your global appeal to change the world for the better. We need more people like you out there that aren't afraid to use their fame, stature and respect to change the world for the better and it was an absolute privileged watching you play basketball.

This bullshit ruins posts. Him writing a fictional story didn't ruin the post, your need for whatever the fuck you're looking for when you go detective mode ruins the post.

<TEXT> Yeah, but you can't value a player based on his team.

Eh, I disagree man. Morey matches that offer sheet if Bosh had signed with us. The market dictated his value so high because team(s) were willing to overpay based on their teams contract situations (Rockets w/ being able to sign RFA over the cap   Mavs w/ Dirk taking a major paycut).

I do however think this was a very unique situation which we won't see again for a long time.

And agreed that he'll be impossible to trade if they ever want to.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Obama didn't de-escalate anything in Iraq. He left on the timeline Bush negotiated after trying to renegotiate to keep US troops there longer.

Bush signed the SOFA Accord but the war *was still going on* and Obama was the one who presided over the actual complete withdrawal of US combat troops from Iraq. It's one thing to sign such an agreement at the end of your final term and another to actually follow through on it. The SOFA Accord was signed 5.5 years after the invasion of Iraq. Lets not pretend that Bush ended anything. He introduced the framework for his successor, but his successor still had to end the hostilities. Would McCain have backtracked on SOFA had he been elected? If you believe yes (which his words leading up to the election would indicate), then how could you not agree that Obama was the one who actually ended the war? We invaded without UN approval, what makes you think a flimsy withdrawal agreement couldn't have been superseded?

He increased the troop numbers in Afghanistan for years with no benefit, or clear mission, before finally pulling back troops.

The idea was the same coin as the successful 'troop surge' in Iraq during Bush's presidency. Just like in Iraq, it worked until the surge subsided. The problem with both conflicts was that there was *never* a clear desired outcome, we wandered in without a goal and with outdated strategy and the people of Iraq and Afghanistan paid the price.

He completely botched Libya

How so? The goal was to support dissidents of Qaddafi in a bid to oust him from power, which was accomplished with intelligence sharing and the targeted strikes of Libyan military assets. Unless you mean botched as in he botched it by getting involved in the first place; an assertion which time will paint a more detailed picture of and you could very well be right on.

and funneled weapons to Syrian rebels, many of whom were Islamist terrorists.

I'm not going to argue with you on that one. I really don't know where I stand on the whole Syrian Civil War or our involvement.

He tried to get involved in Syria very early on and only backed down when there was a large public backlash. You don't remember the whole redline comment?

See, the fact that he backed down when there was a large public backlash is an important point to me.

Obama doesn't get credit just because he didn't get involved in every little skirmish.

When your country has been at the forefront of foreign military intervention since the 1950s, I think you should get a little credit when your foreign policy shifts slightly from that precedent.

Bush had international support when he started his wars, too, as well as congressional ***and UN approval***.

Not in Iraq. International support was paltry at best and UN approval was non-existent.

If anything, he's doubled down on all of the previous administration's follies.

I just can't agree with that when one of those admins started two separate trillion plus dollar ground wars and the other didn't. 

I'm just saying Obama is not anything like the peacenik you're trying to paint him as.

I'm not painting him like a peacenik, I just disagree that he is a war-hawk.

His foreign policy isn't perfect. Far from it, it's lukewarm at best. I don't agree with a great deal of his foreign policy but I do think it's a step in the right direction away from his predecessor (because tepid isn't great but it's better than scalding water for washing your hands).

You should take off your blinders and see what he's really been up to.

You should save the personal attacks for personal arguments.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 100% false. Bush ended the Iraq war, Obama wanted to stay.

If Bush ended the Iraq war, how could his successor want to say?

The Iraq War didn't end until December of 2011, Obama was elected in 2008 and took office in January 2009.

Nice rebuttal, you're off to a good start. 

Um...Do what? Limited by what standards? No occupation?

Uh, yeah. Limited as in limited. Limited as in minimizing war resource allocations.

We always try and claim international support. We did the same thing in Iraq.

Well we *did* initially have a lot of international support in Afghanistan and Iraq to a lesser extent but then we stayed there for a decade, and rightfully lost it.

You seem to think unless we are invading and occupying everything is ok.

I absolutely do not think that, and for you to jump to *that* conclusion based off my comment tells me more about you than you not knowing which president ended the War in Iraq (and confidently not knowing it to boot).

The only thing he hasn't done is a full scale invasion....everything else is 100% Bush policy.

Right...the only thing he hasn't done is get the US stuck in 2 separate trillion+ dollar wars which significantly hurt our international standing and isolated us from our allies.

But I mean really, Obama's foreign policy diverges enormously from GWB's, for better or for worse.

De-escalated/ended war in Iraq from US presence standpoint; de-escalating Afghanistan from US presence standpoint; limited involvement in Libya (air strikes + intelligence); limited/no involvement in Egypt; limited/no involvement in Iraq/Palistine; refusal to join the fight in Syria for 4 years; no action in Ukraine; delayed action against ISIS until now (according to the West chatterbox). And you look at the conflicts we've been involved in (that weren't inhereted) and they share the common bond of international support.

<TEXT> I know... The whole point was that Central Park is super busy so people throwing organic refuse in it would not be the same as throwing it in the woods with little foot traffic and lots of space.

Central Park - Lots of Space, lots of foot traffic = not good to throw organic refuse (see: lots of traffic)

'a park' - minimal space, low traffic = not good to throw organic refuse (see: minimal space)

'the woods - lots of space, minimal traffic = fine to throw organic refuse. (see: lots of space, minimal traffic)

<TEXT> I'm not really whining about it just explaining a possible explanation. Yes other countries get shat on, the US just happens to be the biggest target with lots of skewed perceptions which are easily mocked(fat, loud, proud bible thumpers), as well as it's cultural (and geographic) isolation from the rest of the world (American football, imperial system, military expenditures/incursions, healthcare system, tipping, not showing sales tax in the price, ez cheeze, etc.).

On top of all that, it's been the preeminent world super power for the past 70 years. The USSR was close militarily during the Cold War(really a wash because of nuclear arsenals, though with conventional weapons it lagged behind), although it lacked the economy to ultimately compete;  China is currently even economically (or a little bit stronger) but lacks the military projection that allows the US to dictate a lot of policy they wouldn't otherwise have the capability to pull off.

So you've got all these factors rolled into one country that's honestly just a big, easy, slow moving target for global mockery. It can get tired,  and it's like, we're exempt from sympathy because "we're like the rich white guys complaining about persecution".

The best part? When I respond in kind I'm just an ignorant, boorish American.

Oh well, I guess it's the price you've got to pay for your country's disproportionate influence on global affairs since the end of WWII. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a funny comment because I simply believe that we are different, and get frustrated that the way we do things is considered the "wrong" way. I don't think either system is inherently superior, they boil down to a divergence of extremely trivial cultural developments.

I've never said "not tipping is so STUPID how are you supposed to get good service if the server doesn't have the incentive of a nice tip" nor "including taxes in the sticker price of goods can create a misunderstanding and dissonance between the actual value of goods and their taxed rate".

Meanwhile I responded to a comment saying that "the system of tipping *is* bad, and an established living wage salary without tipping is a superior system", and "america is backwards for not including taxes on their sticker prices".

I was drunk and feisty in my responses, granted. However, even if I was exhibiting the dunning-kruger effect, how were you not? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  but some things like alcohol, cigarettes, and gas have an additional tax in some counties or cities. 

These taxes are different than sales tax (they're 'vice taxes') and are already added to the price.

For instance, NYC has a very high cigarette tax but the sticker price reflects that from the get go.

<TEXT> I'm extremely empathetic towards suicide and persons who see no answer but it, but suicide can definitely be a 'selfish' act. I can honestly only speak for myself but dealing with depression, accepting it and so forth, the contemplation comes when you have narrowed your field of vision to such a sliver that honestly all you can think about is yourself. "Where do *I* fit in? Who am *I* really? Am *I* really worth it?

That's the thing I think, it's not selfish in the traditional sense of 'taking an extra slice of pizza when there's not enough to go around' but in the 'wow I'm so miserably self absorbed right now'.

But then seeing it first hand and it's reverberation through the person's family and friends; no matter how low I feel, how insignificant and inconsequential, no matter how inward and introspectively down I get,  I can always count on the sudden burst of 3rd person awareness that takes
Me out of me and allows me to not be selfish. 

It's a fucking battle, between you and yourself, where a part
of you that wants to die and it's selfish enough to try to drag the whole with it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bitching about sales tax not being including boggles my mind. Do you honestly add everything up at a grocery store and have an exact figure in your head for what you will be spending, and then if you do, what the fuck is the difficulty with doing some basic multiplication with that basic addition? Y'all just bitch to bitch because it's not what you're used to. Fuck. Seriously infuriating. Y'all act like god came down from the heavens and declared tipping wrong and we're the only ones who ignored his sacred proclamation. You pay 4 fucking times as much for a pizza in Australia verse the US and you twats still have the nerve to whine about an expected *BUT NOT REQUIRED* 15% service charge.

<TEXT> HailCab was nicer than calling for a cab but the app pales in comparison to its lyft uber counterparts. It's location service was unreliable and often wouldn't be able to find the address you entered. Compare this to uber/lyft which utilizes GPS (or you can manually enter an address) and you are automatically paired with a driver which you can see in real time in the app. Also I found that every time id ask to pay with a card on hailacab, the driver would claim I put cash even when of show them my confirmation ticket.

It's just a superior service in every way.

That team had so much fucking swag it made swaggy p look like just regular p. Artest, Scola, Lowry, Wafer, Hayes, Yao, LANDRY, Fucking DEKE!, Battier.

Honestly think if T-Mac was healthy, Deke didn't end have a career ending playoff injury, and Yao was healthy (though he finished the series with the Lakers) they would have gone to the finals. Shoot I think even with just a healthy Deke in the Lakers series we could have pulled off the upset (took them to 7).

That team and the 22-win streak team the year before have a very special spot on my heart. What made me grow to truly love basketball as a fan. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This was a great post until the last bit where you went completely over-the-top-smug.

I agree that prison is for rehabilitation but it is also a fucking punishment for the crime/s you've committed. While I 100% agree drugs should never land you in prison, and jay walking shouldn't throw you in jail; there need to be appropriate consequences for people's actions. This man raped, drugged and murdered at least one girl. He was a doctor who was in a position of extreme trust. He drugged other people so that he could rape in peace. He hid from society (at least French society) to avoid punishment.

All I'm saying is some people absolutely deserve the attention and humane treatment that fosters rehabilitation; some people deserve to sit in a jail for the rest of their lives and be reminded that being a member of society is something for people who don't rape and murder kids. 

Also correlation/causation all that.  </TEXT>

I'll admit our roster has been a revolving door since Yao went down but franchise players don't just fall into your lap. Howard was obviously comfortable enough with the FO to take less over resigning with the Lakers.  /r/nba just has on shit colored spectacles when it comes to the rockets. </TEXT>

Parsons - we would have given him 15 million per and gone over the salary cap had Bosh chose Houston

Asik - besides giving him a contract most people scoffed at (including r/nba), we tried to trade him until the trade deadline last season after acquiring Howard. What else do you want? Teams to not get a significantly better player at the position you already have a guy at?

Lin - gave him a team to run and be the focal point of. Just happened to pick up a much better player later that offseason. Their skill sets overlapped.

<TEXT> It's a fucking organization worth hundreds of millions of dollars. In what universe are you expecting them to "be nice". Yeah, they didn't roll out the red carpet like a superstar for the guy, but he was treated extremely well while he was here and conversely he treated us extremely well. Had we signed Bosh, he would have been rewarded directly by us with an instant match of his offer sheet (which would have cost owner Les Alexander a tremendous amount of luxury tax). As it turns out he was rewarded, just by a team up interstate 45.

<TEXT> Our comparable Dirk would have been Yao. Yao's career ended prematurely. Sorry we weren't nicer to him so he'd stay injury free. You have to have that special player first before you can't treat them well. And I guess to get to that discount we have to overpay for him first (by the way think it's a good contract for y'all as Dirk's widow is small - but a bad contract for us). So while I think y'all are overpaying for him, it makes sense, like it would have made sense for us to overpay him if we had signed Bosh.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah it's a pretty shitty forum. bsk4 must not have been going there for a long time. The whole contingent of 'player only fans' started with Yao when half of the posters were Chinese fans who only gave a shit about Yao and not the Rockets. Even before that though you had the old guard who would do nothing but compare the current squad to the championship era of Hakeem - dubbed 99ers (because they were original members when the board was founded in 99 - fun fact: i got banned from clutch fans about 5 years ago for telling Tinman (like The King of 99ers), to gobble on some dicks and stop talking the "good old days" so much). Honestly though, 'player/era only fans' aren't even the worst part. It's very knee-jerk, players (and coaches) get thrown under the bus constantly and are swiftly pulled out and kissed on the forehead when they play up to the expectations of entitled observers. Fickle, unintelligent posters abound, caution.

To be fair, there are a few posters there who are extremely solid and possess impressive basketball minds (DaDakota, Big Moe, HayesFan to name a few who stick out), unfortunately they get drowned out by what you're talking about. </TEXT>

I never said that, but Dallas didn't beat the Spurs either.

Ideal outcome for the weekend - Germany wins vs. Ghana, US wins vs. Portugal. That gives both the US and Germany 6 points putting both teams through. If Ghana beats Germany and we beat Portugal then, like you said, there are 3 teams vying for 2 spots in the last game instead of 2 teams in (assuming US and Germany W). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't really see how that would be all that beneficial. The more intersecting thoroughfares you have, the more 4-way stops and stop lights you need - this is bad.

I think the solution will be more 'science' than 'structure'. Mandated staggered business hours to lighten the rush that is rush hour, better light timing, emphasis on, implantation of and general acceptance and use of quality mass transit, better pedestrian options, better driving culture, the rise of driverless cars, etc.

Many small, subtle changes can add up to very noticeable gains. 

 Of course, it would require us to sacrifice certain quaint values about quiet, empty suburban streets, but oh well. This is Houston. The city proper. If you want quiet suburban streets, move to Katy.

And no, I don't want to sacrifice the small amount of pedestrian friendly areas for something that there is no basis or evidence that it works. (unless there is which I'd be interested in reading)

Buy up houses that are in the way via eminent domain, bulldoze them, and build connections in there place. This would help immensely with traffic at a fraction of the price of building new highways.

Easy to say until your house is on the chopping block. Also, this would not be cheap. Imminent domain acquisition is expensive and time consuming. Roads aren't cheap. Bridges aren't cheap. Restructuring intersections (where do we add stop lights? where do we add stop signs? where do we create 4 way stops?) to take on the added weight of new thoroughfare traffic can't be easy. </TEXT>

He gives us more national exposure than most of our homegrown guys (Bun B excluded - DJ Screw is legend status but outside of Houston and HH he is non-existent - Mike Jones was a cruel joke - Z-Ro, KeKe, ESG, wreckshop family, etc. all have in-state pull but that's about it).

Laying under your tin roof during one of those rain storms is just the perfect nap time. Then the sun comes out, and the weather is perfect the rest of the time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe in response to the bonanza of 'loss of income' claims levied after deep water, which BP was pretty much just accepting without any actual trial. This concentrates the judicial power of the state into one entity. Now the small municipality who sees a cash cow can't just file a lawsuit and pad it's pockets.

I think the bit about any monies received must be used for wetlands protection supports this.

Anyways, truth probably lies somewhere in the middle and once again a lot of people are gonna be wholly misinformed because OP is wholly misinformed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> See man, that's what you people just don't fucking get. I don't spend 15 hours a day on the internet but I see my fair share, and I've managed to never see this. You might have seen it 15 times, but this was my first.

Sometimes shit just slips through the cracks and you miss something. The simple enormity of the internet and all the content within is impossible for a single person to completely digest in *their lifetime* let alone the relative short amount of time that the internet has been churning out this content.

With that in mind, try to visualize all the stuff that you see for the first time that someone else has seen 15 times. Imagine trying to talk about it and the conversation revolves around the fact that it's "*a fuckin repost man*"

It's annoying. If you have seen something a billion times, what force drives you to go into the comments to let people know that you've seen it before?

I just picture you people in the real world, listening to someone tell a story that you'd already heard before.

"So there I was, sitting on the bench minding my own business when out of nowhe..."

"Dude, wtf, repost! you told this story already."

"Oh ya I did tell you! Sorry mate, but Patricia here hasn't heard it so I'm gonna keep going."

"Fuck Patricia, provide new content and stop being such a story whore"

"Fine... So there I was, sitting on the camel, minding my own busine..."

Patricia speaks up, "I've heard this, one stop telling it!"

e: i mean you're pretty chill about it but damn it's annoying when people act like they're above the repost

I do walk from the rail to my apt in montrose (Westheimer and Montrose abouts) every day after work and I don't think it's far (though it's starting to turn into a sweaty walk). I walk wayyyyy more than the average Houstonian to be fair.

<TEXT> Midtown sounds ideal, shouldn't be too difficult to find a place for $1,000, though might be a little more for the "perfect" spot. There are plenty of places that are pet friendly, but be prepared to pay an extra deposit for large breed. Midtown's population is predominantly young business types between 24-35, has quality night life, is about as central as you can get, it's close to downtown and the light rail (though fairly limited use depending on where your office is located).

Might also want to check out Montrose, there's a ton of large complexes going up and being finished right now. Montrose is just south of Midtown for an idea of the area.

The place you have in your post is pretty much right in between the two (Saint Danes is a great bar if you end up there - only a couple blocks away - and they're dog friendly). </TEXT>

Not really sure what would satisfy you if you can't find a bar in montrose that caters to your type of people. Yuppie bars, bro bars, hipster bars, gay bars, dive bars, cocktail bars, etc. etc., pick your poison.

Dude is busting post moves during the playoffs I didn't even know he had when he was playing for LA.

That's because he didn't have them then. He's been working very closely with Hakeem pretty much since he arrived in Houston and you can definitely see Dream's influence on Howard's post moves. Another sign of his dedication to improvement and his game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a huge difference between not supporting someone and actively disparaging him. After Howard signed with Houston, the vast majority of visible Laker fans spewed vitriol and disdain. "He's not big enough for the bright lights and pressure of LA", "he's washed up anyways good riddance", "he doesn't try what a fake superstar", "worse at offense than thabeet". Obviously I don't believe this represents Lakers fans as a whole but the vitriol usually trumps realism in environments like this and that vitriol rose to the top.

I don't blame you for not supporting him. His time in LA was an unmitigated disaster and then he left.

Still, reasonably discussing Howard as a player and a person was next to impossible for a few weeks/months after we acquired him.

/r/nba was sure he was done, was sure his offensive game was on par with Asik, was convinced he was lazy, sure he was a chemistry killer, etc. etc.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think there's a difference when you're trying to imply that the Toyota Center went into a collective and orchestrated booing of Lin (which didn't happen), versus a few knuckleheads booing Lin (which could have plausibly happened).

The average casual fan in Houston likes Jeremy Lin, honestly probably more than Harden. Harden gets shit on a lot. I don't understand this perception that he escapes scrutiny while Lin is selectively and constantly dragged under the bus.

But hey, whatever can rile up the most /r/nba-heads to the side of 'not houston'.

<TEXT>  I still can't understand how the fans accept Harden shooting 30% doing terrible defense all night and for an "All Star" and "1st team all NBA" player.

jesus christ the skewed perception this subreddit has of rockets fans is crazy. harden gets *so much hate* when he plays poorly, way more than lin. acting like rockets fans are happy with harden's performance is absurd. 

i personally think he is playing poorly but i'm not gonna execute the guy for it. he's a person. same with lin; he has played poorly much more than harden has this season yet it never changed my perception of him. he's a person, they're all young. they all have a lot of pressure on them. they don't have the best coach. etc. etc. the point is that win or lose, bad performance or good performance, i support the team and the players.

this subreddit has gotten pretty unbearable for a rockets fan who just fucking enjoys basketball for the simple fact that it's entertaining. i can't even come in here after a loss anymore; and i'm starting to realize that i shouldn't after a win either.

why does everyone have to take the fun out of sports. why can't we just leave it all on the court, accept the outcome, and talk about the game like fans instead of obsessed school girls with emotional problems? </TEXT>

it's ok man, you guys do enough hating on harden already, we're just balancing it out.

also you aren't paying attention too much because people are pretty polar extreme about harden whichever way he is playing.

i was at the first game, it was the 2nd quarter, i went to the bathroom and a guy next to me was talking to his buddy about how shit harden was.

this was the first game and the first half wasn't even over.

i disagree. i don't see any reason or benefit to bringing hate into the equation. sure i'll be disappointed if we lose, and i'll be disappointed if harden doesn't play well or howard looks like he's playing lazy or lin does something stupid...but it's just basketball and that disappointment wont last longer than 5 minutes. I love the rockets but i'm never gonna turn that into anything other than joy. if they lose they lose and i go home and i go to sleep and i wake up the next day in the exact same situation as if they'd won.

<TEXT> My eyes are open. I choose to enjoy the content that gives me joy, while effectively ignoring those which don't.

Nothing is worse than seeing a post that I enjoyed, wandering into the comments to actively discuss or read a discussion or just make a silly comment, and seeing it filled with nothing but 'repost', 'op is a faggot', 'this isn't oc', 'op is a karma whore', etc. etc.

1st, it takes any potential conversation out of play. 2nd, it's petty. People whine and whine and whine about karma whores and that OP is 'only in it for the karma' and OP 'is trying to deceive us', but they don't realize that half the content they are enjoying could suffer equal fates in their respective comment sections.

It's just bad manners frankly. It's rude. It takes away from other's experiences.

Granted, there are cases where OP has blatantly deceived the reddit populace, but unless it's for actual monetary gain, I honestly could give two shits.

Lied about your mom banging your dog? Cool, thanks for the story.

Lied about a celebrity you saw? Cool, thanks for the photo.

<TEXT> Why do you think it's unfair? She's not exactly likeable, especially pre-Dance with Dragons. She isn't relatable. She isn't funny. She is pretty mean to Arya. She is selfish and entitled. She liked Joffrey. She lies when it suits her personal interests.

I get that she's in a shitty situation post GOT but that doesn't mean people have to like her.

Arya, on the other hand, is cunning, brave, strong, independent, adventurous, awesome, resilient, funny, and relatable to 'the little guy'. </TEXT>

It's fine in neighborhoods and less busy side streets but I just feel extremely vulnerable on a bike with cars (driven by Houstonians) approaching from my blind spot (see: I don't have eyes in the back of my head). I walk anywhere 2 miles or less (walking is under valued in today's society) and taxi anything between 2 and 5 miles, which covers most of my territory.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I fucking love the light rail. Instead of driving to work, I started commuting via bus and rail. Takes a bit longer (30 mins in morning up from 15-20, 45 in the afternoon up from 30) but god damn are my stress levels way way down. I don't call grandma a cunt for driving too slow or get stressed out when I miss a light. It seriously has improved my life in many ways. I'd recommend it for anyone who can, and hope that with the current surge of centralized population growth, the demand and need will be in place for valuable expansion.

Having a car is nice, not relying on a car is much nicer.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My mum was convinced I *would* get raped *just because I moved to NYC*. Not for going out and partying every night, but for living in a city.

While I agree that is valid for a parent to worry about their child's safety, I think it's outlandish to be convinced that you would get raped just because you moved to NYC. That's pretty outlandish, no? Just as a numbers game, the rate of rape per 100,000 people in NYC is 14, while the rate of rape per 100,000 in the US as a whole is almost twice that at 26.9. As far as cities go, NYC is one of the (if not the?) safest, at least in the US. So while it might be *less safe* than where you originate (I'm picturing the town from Hot Fuzz), it's not like you're living in Cairo or Mumbai. If that were the case, I don't think it would be quite so outlandish.

So yeah, we agree, moms worry, it's not wrong for them to worry, I just think the comment I quoted was outlandish.

People worry about a lot of outlandish things, it doesn't mean they're wrong, it just means they worry about unlikely scenarios which they have no control over.

Good point! Wow, such generalized insight!

That's pretty much the whole point of a bar. Though it is possible to go to one *and not get smashed*, *the odds of that are pretty slim*. 

Smells like you have an alcohol problem.

 I don't think you know what "irresponsible"

I think it's irresponsible for you to assume that someone with a fairly obvious grasp of the English language doesn't know what a basic word like irresponsible means. </TEXT>
