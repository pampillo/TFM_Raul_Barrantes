It's a 2007 Toshiba Satellite X205-S7483 Laptop setup for Gaming but I didn't play any games (is an XBox player) but I'm hoping it's not going to be to hard to upgrade. Any advice is really helpful, thanks. There's a Micro Center in my neighborhood I'm heading to soon but I thought I would ask here first, thanks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Happened to me once when I was following a large truck through a flooded area and he decides that would be a good time to stop in the middle of it to lean out and take a pic. The wave back washed even higher than the normal level and I got stuck. Parked it after tow on high ground, turned out the tailpipe and muffler got filled, replaced that and drove it for 5 more years. Check the muffler. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The two main floors plus the smaller (only about 100 vendors) room to the right on the ground level. We got there right after they opened and when they flicked the lights to let us know they were closing we still hadn't seen everything. That's why it's three days long. I just wished I was able to go everyday but that was impossible this year. Try going to the International Restaurant and Equipment Show when it comes next year, you can eat better there also, if a company's got an oven to try and sell you he's gonna have fresh pizza or meat on a grill all day long. Plus when I got my badge scanned i got a 1lb package of Apple Wood Smoked Bacon from a Wisconsin Company as a surprise a month later. Saved that for BLT on the wife's birthday! Last year there was a Canadian company trying to introduce their answer to a pastrami sandwich, they sell you a case of already cooked flash frozen prepared pastrami in an 8oz plastic bag, just have a pot of boiling water ready and when a customer wants a sandwich just pop one or two in the water depending on the size of your sandwich and wait for a few minutes until reheated and wham, a hot pastrami sandwich on order with no waste and no need to worry about expiration dates. Plus the pastrami was pretty good. I'll check to see if I have any pics from that show. Again it's just for professionals only. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Especially high end restaurants have a lot. When I was going to school I interned at a high end restaurant in Brooklyn and I worked along side students from Peter Klump, The Culinary Institute of America and The New York Restaurant School. When the chef found out I had line experience he used me to replace the guy working the pasta station for one night a week. The other interns then on hated me because they were still chopping onions, scaling fish and doing all the other prep work that a restaurant needs for a dinner service. If you want everyone to love you you can never survive a professional kitchen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everyday there is some version of this going on on some subway line or platform. The performers you see in places like Times Square actually have to perform their act to be approved by the city before they are allowed to perform in public. There's a guy who plays a piano on the platform, he gets the piano down by using the Handicapped elevator.

<TEXT> I was working for a small bus company in NYC, tours, airport transfers things like that. My boss was a good guy and a lot of his contacts were through friends of his so we were always getting really nice clients and jobs. I was waiting for a group to come out of the Natural History Museum when I spot Jerry Seinfeld cooling down after a run in Central Park right next to my bus. I told him I was a big fan and asked for an autograph and he just gave me the haughtiest look I have ever been given in my life, he snorts and just walks away rolling his eyes. Seinfeld hadn't been on for long and I remember him begging to get on Stern when he was working the tri state area, that's when I found out his distaste for giving autographs to the point he even included it in his American Express commercials years later. Whatever, right? Fast forward a few years and Seinfeld is bigger than ever and I'm driving around the UWS giving a night tour to this group really nice group from Alabama, they could not have been more friendlier if they tried. Well I pull up to a light and I spot Seinfeld talking with a friend at his corner, he's looking for a cab and I remember the snub from before so I get on the speaker, point him out and then opened the door right in front of him and in about a minute he was surrounded. The look on his face, PRICELESS! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The ONLY G Train Stop and Wait Here to Board Sign is posted 5 feet in front of the stairs, having never taken the G Train before I walked up those stairs and then down the platform past those 2 people in the picture. I was hoping to get in the first car to look out the window as the train went along the elevated tracks but to my surprise the train stopped WAY down the platform and the doors closed before I could run back down the platform so I had to wait for another train. The same thing happened to 2 guys when the next train showed up but I blocked the door so they could run down and get in. </TEXT>

I think if he just said I like the footballs I use to be a little under inflated and an equipment guy did it so his teams quarterback would be just that more comfortable in the game, everyone would have forgiven him and moved on. Has nobody learned nothing from Watergate? The coverup is always worse than the original crime. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't made these but I plan to, but I have made cookies like these before. The WW flour will create a softer cookie with a softer mouth feel than a regular flour cookie. Try halving the recipe and giving it a try. A small bag of Whole Wheat flour is not that expensive and if you don't like the cookies you can look up muffin or quick bread recipes to try. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't crop or change the pic in anyway. I just checked karmadecay with the pic as I found it. I checked other pics and they came up already posted. Odd. Maybe because of the nsfw tag? It's been well over 3 months so I might have posted it anyway because it's a cool pic. I can only go by what it says, right? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Was on Lexington Av NYC waiting to turn on 59th Street, in front of Bloomingdale's, when a man wearing all white, White Hat, white suit, white shoes wearing a full length White Sable Fur Coat carrying a large Bloomingdale's bag erupts from the store's entrance and runs full speed headlong into oncoming traffic, dodging moving cars and quickly disappears into the 59 street subway station. Out pops two security guards a minute later but the guy is gone. I've wondered since then what the story was behind that mad dash. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Found out all this the hard way yesterday. Live in Brooklyn and ran over some debris on the NJ Turnpike coming home from the Microsoft Store in the Paramus Mall which put a hole in the engine. Insurance junked it and now I'm taking public transport everywhere. Decided to visit my relatives in Williamsburg only to discover I have to go through Manhattan and transfer to the J or M. Great. MTA's Trip Finder is not working (first red flag) so the wife and I map it out. Decided to take the Express bus (as we had luggage) into the city and get off at Fulton to catch the J. The express bus decides to take the streets instead of the highway (red flag #2) but finally make it into the city an hour later. Walk to the new Fulton Street Subway stop and many twists and turns and a lot of fucking stairs the J station is roped off, walk back to the A going to West 4th street and transfer there. Get on A going in the wrong direction (with help from a visably frustrated MTA worker whose job it was to help people find their way with all this construction, red flag #3) and end up back in Brooklyn so get off and decide to catch the G train. After waiting 45 minutes, now with a platform full of people we all squeeze into the train as the conductor announces this is not the only G train as there will be another one coming RIGHT behind in about 25 to 30 minutes, everyone laughs and no one gets off. Finally we head out to our guessed at stop, Flushing (having never taken the G before, red flag #4) and finally have to walk along some deserted blocks to get to my father in laws apt only 4 hours after we left and we live in the same boro! It's between $25 and $30 bucks each way by cab, car service, Uber, or Lyft and in calculating it would be as much to lease a new car for a year than go through all this bullshit week in and week out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A down the road neighbor had this same problem. Old man put up BLINDING lights on the side of his house that faced the neighbors bedroom at night. He kept them on 24/7 and would absolutely not turn them off for any reason. Numerous complaints to the cops came to no avail. She had her sons build a fence that in the middle by the lights is now over two stories tall. For a kicker the son put lights on the ends all pointing at every window of the old guys house and when he called the cops they used his same excuses for the lights. Never piss off a lady with sons.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Did you know the film has spawned a controversy in the real world of baking? In the movie the baker makes Bavarian Sugar Cookies https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnKQo9n7M6Q so around that time I meet a guy who wants to hire me to run his kitchen that he's planning to open in a few months and he asks me if I can make some cookies for his daughters Sweet Sixteen party and I say sure but then he hits me with a request for Bavarian Sugar Cookies from this movie he saw with his daughter the day before the party. I research it online only to find out there IS NO Bavarian Sugar Cookie, it just sounded good to the writer. They had a bakery out in California make some sugar cookies just as a prop for the movie so there was no recipe to follow. So I ended up making large sugar cookies cut like big apples flavored with sour apple schnapps with red icing and white lettering with her name and happy 16 on them. A few months later while with the wife we sat across from Maggie and her little girl (who is cute as a button) on the subway and I asked her if she knew of the "cookie controversy" her movie has created and she said yes, some friends had told her about it and she said she's been asked for the recipe instead of an autograph a couple of times. LOL </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, if your making boxed mac and cheese with the powder mix your going to get what's on the box, a bowl of cheese flavored orange colored soft noodles. Mac and cheese is a classic simple dish that if done well can be amazing and if not done well can still be pretty good. I have a lot of deli's in my neighborhood that have small plastic boxes of the ends of different cheeses cut into squares and the usual mix is cheddar, american, swiss, pepper jack, provolone and munster. It's usually around 4 bucks so if I'm making my mac and cheese I start with one of those.   
In a pot of salted water, cook pasta (medium shells are great as they hold the sauce very well) until just al dente, drain and stop the cooking process by rinsing with cold water until the pasta is cooled and set aside.   
Butter your baking dish, set aside. 
Start with a classic Bechamel Sauce (1 stick salted butter and 2 to 3 cups flour) while stirring cook until roux is golden brown and smells nutty   
Add 1 pint of heavy cream ( or milk) slowly while whisking until incorporated   
Add piece by piece the cubes of cheeses and whisk until melted and incorporated into the sauce and stir until all the cheeses are added to the sauce.    
Remove from heat and stir the finished sauce into the cooked pasta ( this is where you can add whatever you want to the mac and cheese such as pepperoni, chopped, cooked sausage, lobster, crab whatever you want, just fold in gently) then add to buttered baking dish.    
The mac and cheese can be served and eaten as it is now but I like the melted cheese on top and the crispy sides and corners that you can only get from finishing it off in the oven.  
Sprinkle shredded cheese, breadcrumbs ( I love sliced american cheese) on top of the mac and cheese and place into a preheated 375 degree oven until the topping is crisp or cheese starts to turn brown (15 to 20 minutes)   
Remove from oven, let sit for a couple of minutes then serve. Try it this way and let me know how it comes out.

<TEXT> Yes, it's a porterhouse. The New York strip is the bigger cut on the right. If you look at the steak the pieces at the tip are more cooked then the pieces that are closer to the bone, that's why I like this cut for my wife and I, we can each take the pieces that we like. I didn't make this steak but the classic way is kosher salt and pepper on a hot grill over high heat for 3 to 5 minutes until a nice crust forms, flip with tongs and cook for 3 to 4 minutes or longer if you want it done more. let sit to allow the juices to redistribute and cut and serve. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like everyone else, salt and pepper, dry mustard is also good or a little Old Bay Seasoning is another favorite. I also like to use the package of mixed cheese ends that you can find in most stores and deli's, they usually have a mix of american, cheddar, swiss, pepper jack and others. Make a roux, add the cubed cheeses and stir until combined, always works for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just made a basic recipe with what I had in the fridge, Made a large pot of mashed potatoes with butter, salt and milk and set aside. I then sauteed some mushrooms, carrots, onions and a left over small head of broccoli with butter. Then added half a box of beef stock and three tbls of Oyster Sauce, added the leftover meat and let that reduce for a couple of minutes then poured everything into a large baking dish, covered with the mashed potatoes, dotted with butter and baked off in a preheated 350 degree oven for about 15 minutes then finished for 10 minutes at 400, remove and let cool before serving. I really don't know why I didn't take pics during the making of the slow cooker pulled pork or the shepards pie. I made this ramen with the leftover pepperoni ham and cheese stuffed pork chops from my superbowl dinner http://imgur.com/a/8cdy8 </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yea, I think you just need another egg. Biscotti can take a lot of abuse like albino-rhino said. It's a very forgiving cookie to practice on if you don't have a lot of experience. I would invest in a mixer, it would be entirely worth it. Check out your local estate sales, look at the pics and see if there are any mixers available. I check mine all the time for sales and stuff.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One opened at 68 street at the corner at the Alpine Movie theater (which I can't believe is still open!) and became a doughnut shop, there was another across from the theater and is now an Arabic store. One foolishly opened up right across the street from them and is now a Halal place and one opened up between Ovington and 72street and lasted about 6 months. Gino's has the banks and all the doctors offices on 75, Originals has the subway and the kids from the High school on 67. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I picked up Writing Places by William Zinsser because it looked interesting on a thrift store visit a few weeks ago and just got to it. It was a good read and I looked into finding his On Writing Well which seems to be very popular so I was going to order a Kindle edition for $8.50 but thought i would wait a bit for no particular reason. I went to my thrift store again even though I was there yesterday and lo and behold his book was on a shelf! It was NOT there the day before. SWEET! It's not an updated edition but still very readable. </TEXT>

Just good pizza, so good I know for a fact that they have closed down 4 pizzerias who were foolish enough to open within a block of them and they are the last to raise their prices. Nothing but good pizza. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Brooklyn and two guys pop out immediately...   
Neighborhood Guy 1- Elderly Black man who jogs everyday, has to be in his 70's if not older and thin as a rail, emaciated really but he's out there every spring and summer, I can walk faster than he jogs but he's out there in the street all the time. Just saw him the other day. Knew winter was officially over.  
Neighborhood Guy 2- Elderly White man, he's over 6 feet and roller skates every day using a large pole to help navigate around. He collects cans and bottles and you can see him roller skating along holding a large bag of recycles in each hand. It's a sight to see. I haven't seen him in a while, hope he's ok. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Place everything you want to cook in a bowl. Using a nonstick pan, add a knob of butter and a 2 tbls of a good olive oil until it's shimmering then add your hash mix in large spoon fulls, and let it cook until a nice crust forms, lower heat, cover and cook until cooked through, about 5 to 10 minutes depending on how thick the hash is. Remove from heat, place a large plate over hash, invert pan and hash should pop out onto dish. Serve in slices like a pie. I made a slow cooker pork shoulder not knowing it was St Pats day and with the left overs I just made a homemade Shepard's Pie. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was just a smart funny quick read. It's her story about dating in LA, her closeted gay "boyfriends", her ex who she lived together with for five years and who wrote a book calling her my fatassed girlfriend and sharing their stories without warning her and her version of their time together. It was just a funny honest look at herself and her love life and her struggle with the death of her beloved cat Emmit and having gone through a similar event with my wife's cat Noodles I could relate. I read it in a day and was just so enamored of it that when I finished it I tried the email address she had in the book to thank her for the nice few hours she had just given me and for her work on one of my favorite TV shows "My Name is Earl" and she answered back the next day! Here's a link to a story about her ex's books http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/23/fashion/chad-kultgens-uncensored-voice-takes-a-more-serious-tone.html?pagewanted=all and here is her page I found after reading the book http://hilarywinston.com/home/ All in all a very nice thrift store find indeed.

<TEXT> Last year we specifically did not go to the wife's favorite restaurant because money was really tight so we went instead to one of our usual steady standby places after checking the dinner menu online. Made reservations, showed up on time and still had to wait for a table but ok. Got our menu and found they had changed their dinner menu to a chef's Prix Fix dinner menu for $75 each and up. Shit! We talked about leaving, but we were there already, it was getting late so we decided to stay but with drinks we were going to be out at least three hundred and we got fucked over the table by the fire place by the cunt of a hostess (she admitted to giving it to regulars over our reserved spot) I can make the same kind of dinner for a lot less. I'm going shopping tomorrow and I'll see what's out there, steak, pork or lobster. What are your plans? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The wife and I love restaurant week. We're short on cash so every penny helps. Think of using it this way, don't go to a place you've been to before, try some place new that you would not ordinarily go to. This way you get to see the place, feel the vibe and try the food and if you hate it your not left with a feeling "wow, THAT was a total waste of time and money!"   
You can also see if your treated any better or worse because your having the "value" meal. Over the years we found the service, the food and the ambiance of a number of so called high class places so bad that we were so glad we didn't go and pay hundreds of dollars at the regular time. The waiter actually huffed at us when we asked for the restaurant week menu at Smith and Wollensky and when he slapped the menu on the table hard enough to knock over the glasses I got really pissed. Over all it's been a good experience and it's really made for people like us who other wise would not eat out in a big restaurant more than a few times a year.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> OK I see what you mean. Doing all that I guess you would need all that for the internet. 32 acres and not allowed a well? Are you gonna start a rain collection system or is that not allowed either? Love the idea of an outside shower, I want one too! I have property in Upstate New York and I'm really looking into putting something in there. Currently I'm trying to decide between a couple of shipping containers or a house on a goose neck trailer so I can hook up and travel with the wife. Do you know anybody who has traveled with their tiny house on a trailer and blogged about it? I know there's a few with converted school buses but I'm hoping someone has traveled with a tiny house on a trailer and let us know the good and the bad of doing something like that. Good luck and keep letting us know whats up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok I checked your site and can truly appreciate all the time and effort you have put into tiny houses and from some one who is seriously interested in something like this thank you for all the info. I have a few questions if that's ok.   
If your house is on a trailer why do you need a graded road and a parking pad? Is that's because of your area? If you towed your house into your property and used jacks or whatever to solidify your home would the city know?   
Did you check for a well on your property or is that not allowed in your area. Your going solar, why not have a generator as back up and stay off the grid completely?   
Wouldn't a dish or a wi fi hot spot work just as well as a hook up through the city? Trust me on this because they are the only cable in town my brother and I get fucked every spring and summer by the huge cable bill so we keep it on for a few months a year just for that reason. 
Are you now going to have to put in a septic system? If your hooked up the the city's water are they not going to force you to install one? If you have running water are you going to use a composting toilet or have full running water then you will need a septic system, right? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm seriously thinking of either a school bus conversion or a tiny house, that's why when ever I see something like this I stop to check it out. Most tiny houses use a lot of marine equipment intended for boats that are along these lines. i e propane fueled. I think having a really good smoke and carbon detector would be essential to anybody thinking about building a tiny house.

<TEXT> Shipping containers were a perfect fit for these people https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5D4WHT2F0JA. I really think you can get shipping containers for much cheaper than that. It depends where you are in relation to where the containers are. I'm seriously thinking of putting a couple of containers on some property in Upstate NY and the ones I've seen around here are around 3 grand each and another couple for shipping. Are you looking at new or used?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> From what I understand he was making regular payments and was just late a couple of times and when he went to modify it she pressed charges when he moved and he was charged with a felony and lost his job. Until that moment he thought it was something he had not done in time and the charge was automatic. He then lost his job, spent time in jail and in that period of time accrued about 15,000 dollars in debt because of non payment, late fees and court costs all while he was in jail. She just wanted more money thinking just the threat of a felony would make him give her more money but once she pushed for it it became official and he went into the system. The woman who pointed that out even told the woman she went to far and now hes a felon and she's going to get a lot less money, see she was even trying to go after his unemployment. </TEXT>

He was showing them the pictures of the wrecks and the BMW keys to prove it. I never wanted to bitch slap somebody so bad before in my life! </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of the first things you are taught in culinary school is the term "Mise en Place" which means Things in it's place. Check this out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place.  As you go through a recipe have everything you need out and handy already. Do not be afraid to use small cups just like you see on the tv shows, that's the reason the Chef's can make the dish's they do look so easy. As you progress cooking more and more things will come so much more easy to you. Start to build up a knife kit, you do not have to go out and spend $300 on a full knife kit. Start small and buy quality products, knifes, pans spices and ingredients. Ask for a specific item for every birthday, Christmas, anniversary and Valentines Day and you would be amazed how fast you will get what you need. Good luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Long time baker here, same advice I've given before. Find the top one or two Bakeries in your area and ask them if you can intern for free and for you to trail the guys working their shifts. Stick it out for as long as you can/they will let you. That's the only way to learn about the night life that a baker has. You work/bake at night and try to sleep during the day. A bakery is open 365 and it's almost impossible to miss even one day for ANY reason. Start going to restaurant auctions in your area, bring a note book and stay even if your not buying anything just to keep notes on the average prices of the equipment you might need. Trust me buying this way will save you thousands of dollars, for example a 30 Qt Hobart Mixer goes for a couple of grand but you might get lucky and pick up one for between 500 and a grand. You should also start going to the Food Shows and Equipment Shows that pop up around the country. I've already got my tickets to this one in March in NYC http://www.internationalrestaurantny.com/Content/16.htm. This is one of the better ones around, I've eaten better here than at the Fancy Food Shows because a guy selling a new oven is going to show off how good it works by making food for everybody! But you can see what trends are coming, what new equipment does what. Buy tickets and make the trip then check out Sullivan Street Bakery on 47 st http://www.sullivanstreetbakery.com/and Bien Cuit http://biencuit.com/   in Brooklyn and all the other great bakeries in and around NYC </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hate you! I've been looking for something just like that for the last 6 months just because I want one. I'm lucky in one way that there is a GoodWill just two blocks away but it sucks in another that it is the last one in the area, down from 5 to this last one. Now they have large bins out front and hardly anything gets put on the shelf's anymore, just picked up to go to the larger stores in other neighborhoods.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Had a winter wedding in NYC, regrouped at the hotel for an hour then had to arrive five hours early for a flight to St Lucia (security and possible snow storm) got to our place, checked in and made the late dinner then crashed in our beautiful ocean view room. I woke up at two in the morning with severe cramps thinking I maybe got food poisoning from the local fish until around 3am I realized I was having kidney stones. I called the front desk for a doctor or an ambulance and was told the Island clinic was closed but if I wanted an English Hospital I would have to take a boat to the Big Island a few hours away and thought fuck that. So there I was in our beautiful marble tiled bathroom jumping up and down trying to make the stones pass on their own. I had some before and was told to do this by my doc if it happened again. After an hour of jumping I finally felt them and slowly worked them out of me over the tub because by now I was like a sprinkler and with a plink, plink plink sound I passed THREE kidney stones by myself in the bathroom. The next morning my wife thought I was pleasuring myself but before my bride went out to enjoy herself my body was having a reaction, I was freezing and my teeth were chattering but there was nothing but a sheet on the bed so my wife covered me with the sheet, my robe and towels from the bathroom. Thank God we were at a resort that two body treatments a day as part of the package and I was able to add one more a day so I had either water treatments or body massages which saved me! BTW this was going on while we were there https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tpzBnbL04, also can
t say enough about this place and they just finished a million dollar renovation http://www.thebodyholiday.com/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> BAM! That's exactly what I was looking for but goddam is it ugly. Do you know the person who did this or is it off the net? Off the top of my head I would bring it back a few feet and just have aluminum from the top of the bus to the bottom for a much cleaner look. If your doing it this way why keep the windshield? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm trying to get as much info as I can between converting a school bus, building a Tiny House on a trailer (I've decided that if I go for that I'm going to use a goose neck trailer like this http://imgur.com/wxt6Doe) and I was just wondering if it was legal or possible to do this with a bus with the possibility of removing the front end of a bus and converting it to a goose neck style attachment for a pick up truck which I would need anyway with a tiny house unless I rent one or lease one for a cross country trip.

<TEXT> I'm thinking along the lines of reliability, having a bus full of house stuff and towing a vehicle would add a lot of weight and strain to the engine, right? I've read on some of the school bus conversion blogs that the gas mileage is in the low double digits and I don't want to pay for repair after repair and in some cases adding a new power package (engine, trans rear end) would cost more than the bus itself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yea, that's along the lines that I was thinking. I've seen them with goose neck in the bed. I've seen school buses going for $3 grand with a ton of miles on the engines and I'm worried just how reliable they are. I drove for a private bus company years ago and we were using brand new Ford Cabs with extended bodies like this http://imgur.com/0gh6xLd and it was a bitch to get certain parts sometimes and we had our own mechanic and we were based in Brooklyn New York.

<TEXT> The first "classic" omelet is also called American style because they are most often the one served in American restaurants because most American style omelets are then stuffed and have to sit in the pan longer so they cook longer. "French" style is more the second one and is my personal favorite, you can really taste more of the egg that way but when I made them for my family one morning I had to reheat them as they really didn't like them because they were just not used to them. After I learned the difference and when it came time to make omelets in class I was ready. When it was my turn I asked the Chef instructor which style he preferred I make for him, American or French I was rewarded with a smile and nod as well as an A+ for my efforts. These little things count, the poor guy was tasting overdone eggs all morning. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I became friendly with some of my instructor Chefs at my culinary school, especially after they learned I worked nights at an artisan Bakery so I could bring in fresh bread. We met early before class and ate the different things they would cook and I would stand there around the metal table and listen to their stories. I learned that each Chef had to do an egg omelet before they were hired. The reasoning is if you can't do an omelet then how can you be expected to teach students? The tall paper hats worn by executive Chefs have 107 folds in them signifying the ways a French Chef is supposed to know how to prepare eggs so yes, it is very important! Practice, practice and practice!!!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a chef tell me to let it rest over some eggs, preferably the best brown eggs you could get so the Truffle will impart some flavor through the shell so you can have truffled eggs without using the truffle itself. If you can't smell a woodsy aroma immediately then you may have gotten an old truffle. If you have any left then bring it back and try to talk to someone who knows what they are doing in the store. Good luck.

<TEXT> Had a power problem on a 6 year old Toshiba laptop that I bought at Best Buy. Since I had a problem I took it to the geek squad to see if they could help. They took it and two weeks later was told I needed a new motherboard which would cost $900 bucks. I said no and took my laptop home. That day I received a mailer about a computer place called Micro Center opening up in Brooklyn only 10 minutes away so I took a shot and brought my laptop there. After signing in the teck took all of 5 minutes to figure out it was part of the power cord (which I had just replaced a month earlier) that connects from the plug into the power converter. He stood there holding the cord long enough to power the battery in the laptop enough to turn on and make sure that was the problem. They had one in stock for $9 bucks on sale for $6 so Micro Center saved me $ 804 dollars.   
My advice, follow some of the good posts here and try to be a nice guy about it, at first. If you still have no satisfaction just stand outside the Best Buy with your laptop and a sign stating your problem, what happened and what Best Buy did or more importantly what they didn't do to help you. Bring friends and just be a pain in the ass until you get some satisfaction. Shit, if your in Brooklyn buy me lunch and I'll do it just for fun. And a lunch. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mr Rock, the wife and I were at a comedy show in NYC a while back when you popped up on stage with a Legal pad with jokes written on it. You kept saying lower your expectations to the crown applauding and cheering you but as soon as you saw that a girl nearby was holding up her phone you left the stage and then the building after being on stage for no more than two minutes. I can understand why you would not want new untested material going out over the net before you have a chance to hone it and just make sure it's just funny, but why not have a simple statement given by the mc stating that pictures are ok but only after the set?  </TEXT>

They buy cheap and hold for as long as they can which is why I can't stand having a big menu in a small place because once people think the food is sub par while they might buy a coffee or tea they will get anything else somewhere else. </TEXT>

You could just feel the frustration even from that small article, even though raising rents, costs and everything else helped to close him down and he's frustrated and angry.

<TEXT> I heard a story that when Nobu first opened there was a small waterfall along one wall and when the restaurant hit one of the partners wanted to remove it and replace it with two tables. The Chef argued that it was pleasing to look at and he always wanted one in his place, the partner then told  him each table would average about a hundred thousand dollars a year. You have to look at everything from the owners/bosses point of view. Everything costs money. </TEXT>

Other redditers have pointed out the photographer like I hoped but the image is not a straight photograph, it was digitally mixed of a few pics by the photographer. Is that OK on /r/Earthporn?

<TEXT> It's all Starbucks fault for things like this. There's one in Union Square, NYC that have a bunch of people come in early, take a table and chairs and actually schedule business meetings all day long, only using their Starbucks reward card to order something when they have to. I was helping a guy open a small Cafe in Brooklyn that was near a college and he had to seriously think about adding free wifi because he didn't want the cafe overrun with broke college students who thought buying a bottle of water entitled them to hours of free wifi and a comfy chair. I'm sure the manager knew how bad financially they were in when she went off on the woman who thought it was perfectly ok to ask for a spoon to eat her yogurt she bought somewhere else and sit and take up space.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was working a prom as a bus driver some years ago and over heard a kid brag that he had to wreck 2 new Ford Mustangs to get the BMW he wanted in the first place. He even had the pictures of the wrecks to prove it plus the spoiled little fuck broke a mirror off my bus because he was so "wasted" on the beer they were drinking. The boss billed them triple for the mirror and they didn't blink an eye. It must be nice to be rich. Plus if she did this at 15 it's a little to late to start giving her life lessons now. I guess the nannies didn't do a good job of raising her. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was working as an EMT for a private company based out of NJ but I was working the NY side. My partner and I had just finished for the day when we realized one of our patients had left her wallet in the back of the ambulance. When we looked it belonged to a woman who lived in the Marcy Projects in Brooklyn. She was on dialysis 3 times a week and that week the elevator was broken so we had to do a 18 flight carry down, bring her for treatment and then bring her back for an 18 flight carry up back to her apt. Thank god we only had to 3 times. Since I lived in Brooklyn I called her and said I would drop it off and asked if her son could meet me downstairs by the street. After I gave him the wallet I was doing some paperwork when I heard little pops, then my side window and windshield explodes all over me, I put the ambulance in gear, throw the full lights and sirens switches and peel out of there like I was doing a quarter mile and didn't stop until I was able to check myself out. The Police laughed and said I was just to tempting a target sitting there for just a few minutes to long. Nobody was caught but I never did that job again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a fan of them to but I'm tired of having to pay for their monthly service year after year. I did it once, didn't go back for a while and when I did it was like I had to start all over again. Remember they print out their magazine out as a cookbook every year so if you want just get that, it's cheaper in the long run. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cooked a large turkey with butter and dried fresh herbs under the skin and got a Turkey Breast, deboned it and stuffed it with cornbread stuffing, Serrano ham and fresh mozzarella cheese so I really had two kinds of turkey. Carved the big turkey one whole side and served the stuffed Turkey Roll in slices. The wife asked for the Turkey Roll and happy wife happy life! I'll add a couple of pics later ok? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Recipe:   
   Take remaining Turkey bits and pieces, roast in a 375 degree oven for 35 minutes, remove from oven and cut up into manageable pieces and place in slow cooker. Scrape as much browned bits (fond) from roasting pan as possible and add to slow cooker.   
   1 medium onion, peel and roughly chop onion and add to turkey   
   4 cloves garlic, peel and lightly mash garlic and add to turkey   
   2 boxes of Vegetable Stock + 1 of water, add to turkey (to cover)   
Place cover on slow cooker and cook on low for 6 hours then high for 1 hour.   
When done strain into colander, picking out removing as much turkey meat as possible, discarding bones and set aside to cool.   
For Soup:   
   3 large Carrots, peeked and cut into thick wedges   
   6 medium Potatoes, peeled and sliced into large wedges   
   1 large Onion, peeled and sliced into large wedges
   3 cloves Garlic, peeled and slightly mashed   
   Salt and Pepper to taste   
   1 1/2 tbl Dried Parsley   
   1/2 stick Butter   
   3 Tbl Olive Oil   
   In a large pot add olive oil and butter and cook on high until hot, add vegetables and let sit until they are browned, then stir, adding a little salt and pepper and dried herbs, cover and let cook for 5 minutes on low heat.  
   Remove cover, add strained Turkey stock, add more salt and pepper

<TEXT> If you want to really do this then find a small but up and coming caterer in your area and ask to work for them, free as an intern if you have to. It's the only sure way to see if it's really something you want to do. The bullshit you see on tv sitcoms and most food related shows only touch the surface. Trust me, you have to live it before you try it. You'll thank me either way you go, starting your own company or trying something else. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Then i guess it would be ok for the video and audio to be used against the alleged criminal? Imagine a cop walking down a street see's two guys pass something to each other, the cop stops them and finds drugs on one and money on the other and since it was on camera it goes against them? I guess then if a cop films a kid tagging a city owned building, instead of the cop maybe giving the kid a warning and taking his paint away he now feels he has to arrest the kid and with the video proof the city then goes after the kids parents for clean up costs because they are responsible for him? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nothing pissed me off more than somebody parking in my DRIVEWAY! I have the only house with a garage on the block, it's 5 feet from the street and they have to pass by 8 fake driveways to reach mine. Just ticketed a guy parked there all day yesterday! print a copy of your apts rules for parking spots and what would happen if she parked there again and just slip it under the door of the apt she's visiting or if you don't know it under her wiper on her windshield. If she parks there again after you've been nice then ticket or tow her. I've had tickets given but have not towed anybody yet and in NY once a ticket is issued the tow fee is on them. </TEXT>
