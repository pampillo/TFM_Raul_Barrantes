<TEXT> From your [Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordie_Howe_International_Bridge#Opposition), evidently the freaking Koch Brothers are involved too. 

 In early June 2011, the conservative group Americans for Prosperity posted bogus eviction notices on homes in Detroits Delray district. With the words "Eviction Notice" in large type, the notices told homeowners their properties could be taken by the Michigan Department of Transportation to make way for the proposed new bridge. The groups state director said the fake notices were intended to get residents to contact state lawmakers, to ask them to vote against the bridge project.[38]

<TEXT> You're projecting your thoughts into my head. My ideal solution is one single state where Jews, Christians and Muslims are living wherever they want and worshipping freely. If you call the death of a Jewish-only state as genocide, then you are deluded. 

The terrorists, the ISIS types, the ones who actually wish a military destruction of Israel would fight against "pro-Palestinians" if Israel is out of the way. They give Israel's military a justification, and most of us don't like that. It's why we have our own organizations and don't work with them. 

I want what happened to South Africa to happen to Israel. Last I heard, when the apartheid there ended, there wasn't some genocide of white South Africans. Now, prejudices there still remain, but people there aren't subject to discrimination and massive human rights violations.  </TEXT>

I'm no supporter of people like sematrix, as you'll see elsewhere in this thread. 

Groups like the Neuteri Karta, blogs like Mondoweiss (run by Jewish bloggers), individuals like Anna Baltzer and Max Blumenthal, and organizations like B'Tselem and Jewish Voice for Peace make it abundantly clear that the problem is not with Judaism nor the Jewish people. </TEXT>

It's only in college and youth soccer in the United States that the substitution rules are different (some subs can come back in the game, there's more than three, etc.). 

Regarding strategy in subs, yes, they are used for that, and they are also used to sub out tired players. It's up to the coach of each team. Sometimes a coach feels the need to make tactical adjustments with different players, and sometimes a player gets hurt or gets tired.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If a dog sniffs you, or their saliva touches you, you become ritually unclean and can't pray unless you wash with something other than water (old traditions say sand, soap is used now), and that basically means a shower. I don't fear a dog that isn't attacking me, but I pray five times a day and I can't go run and shower and/or change clothing.

As such, Muslims are discouraged from keeping dogs unless we have a real purpose, like for hunting, using one as a guard dog or herding sheep on a farm, for example. This has led to Muslims seeming skittish about dogs, and since we don't keep them as pets, those of us who never spent much time around them (i.e. people who grew up in Muslim countries) may have some misconceptions about dogs. 

Really, though, most of us keep our distance because we're thinking about the next prayer and don't want to deal with showering and changing clothes.

<TEXT> I live closer to the Amish than you do, lol. We probably live in the same state. I consider myself practicing, and no, it is not a sin to talk to you. Many Muslim women who cover wear jeans, actually most of of the young Muslim women I've met in the states wear jeans. 

Women aren't required to have a man escorting them everywhere. In some of the more conservative Muslim countries,  sure, that rule is there and it is misguided, but the lack of education of many there makes it a safety issue for women. 

I've been to Iran, Pakistan, Iraq (mid 1990s), Syria, the West Bank, Egypt, Dubai and Jordan, and I've seen women walking around all the time on their own without a male guardian. My mother and sister got to work every day on their own and both wear the hijab.

We use modern technology,  unlike the Amish, and we tend to wear all types of clothing, unlike them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Meanwhile millions of Muslims go through live every day, going to school, going to their jobs, raising their families, living their lives as ordinary citizens, throughout Europe and the United States, not bothering anyone. 

Except you though. Because you sat behind your computer screen, read a couple of articles about some out of the blue, rare, abhorrent actions, and decided that those actions defined an entire religion made up of a billion plus people. 

I can see some radical, sitting behind a computer in a far off Muslim country, hearing about a terrorist attack in response to a U.S./coalition bombing and thinking, "You can do your Do-As-We-Say shit in the U.S. or Europe, but here we will not tolerate it. We will not have non-Muslims control our behavior through violent acts."

You aren't quite that different from that radical. He doesn't have the benefit of an education, so he might do something stupid. Thankfully, all you'll ever do is post stupid things on the internet and continue thinking stupid thoughts.  </TEXT>

 According to the source, Israel offered a four-point proposal that addressed most of the Palestinians grievances.

 1. Palestinian players and coaches will receive special documents to facilitate their travel from Gaza to the West Bank and abroad.

 2. Israel will ease restrictions and promote soccer-related projects in the West Bank, including the construction of a stadium and other facilities.

 3. Israel would cover the costs of tax and customs for sports equipment imported by the Palestinians to the West Bank via Israel  predominantly via the Ashdod seaport.

 4. A joint committee comprised of representatives from Israel, the Palestinian Authority and FIFA would be formed and would convene monthly to address day-to-day issues and any problems that arise. </TEXT>

Eh, this is debatable. They profess to be a constitutional monarchy, but the Hashemite family pretty much calls the shots. They have a secret police and political dissenters aren't always free to express their opinions. They are somewhat better than the Gulf states, but aren't a constitutional monarchy like England or Spain.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You took that excerpt out of context. The story isn't even about Freddie Gray, It's about Detective Joe Crystal, an officer like many here (at least I hope so). You took two paragraphs about a subject not related to the main focus of the article. In any case, the quote you pulled says that the state's attorney concluded this fact, not that she was right or wrong in doing so. 

In no way have you addressed the main content of the article: what happened to Detective Crystal after he reported his fellow officers for misconduct.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your source is non-academic and biased. Taiqiyya is only to be used when one's life is in danger, and has historically been associated with Shi'a Muslims, who concealed their faith to avoid physical harm. I'm not lying to you, and it would be a sin for me to do so. Google that Quranic verse on non-compulsion in religion (which you ignored) if you don't believe me. 

 So you're in a minority. Or, you're lying. Either way, what do I care?

Ah, there we are. Your mind is closed. No matter what you learn or who you meet, you would stubbornly remain prejudiced against Islam and Muslims.  

Muslims like myself are the majority of the world's Muslims. As loud as the extremists may be, their attacks are isolated and don't spark that massive war between Muslims and "The West" (this doesn't make sense because many Muslims live in the West and consider themselves Western). I've attended many mosques and gatherings of different interpretations of Islam, from Sufi to Shia to even Salafi, and have never heard of imposition. 

 Facts define Muslims. A poll determines facts. If you believe those facts are in error, it is incumbent on you to demonstrate it, not just throw your hands in the air and claim you don't believe polls. You'd do just as well saying you don't believe in math.

Well, I'd suggest you show up to a mosque and sincerely and politely ask questions. It doesn't seem like you've ever met any Muslims. I'd sit down and talk with you, but as I mentioned before, you seem a bit closed minded, plus you'd probably physically attack me or something. 

I hope you find the truth, or at least, lose your hostility. Peace be unto you.

<TEXT>  Yes, you implicitly did, just as the author of the article did, by implying that Geller's personality in any way whatsoever justified the response of attempted murder 

We clearly didn't read the same article, as Ali condemned the attackers, saying that Islam says to ignore them. There were no protesters at the exhibition, except the two attackers. The large Dallas-area Muslim community mostly stayed away. The writer in no way says that Geller's personality incited or justified the murder. 

By accusing me of implicitly supporting their actions, you're attempting to read my mind. Neither was justified in their actions, in my opinion. Geller's same "free speech" stance is undermined by the fact that she campaigned against Al Jazeera's launching a network in the United States.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A poll is supposed to define Muslims? I am a Muslim and in none of the mosques I've attended have I ever heard of anyone preaching that Islam should be imposed on anyone. Extremism exists, but it is called extremism because *it is beyond the pale and outside of the mainstream.* It not only flies in the face of religion practiced by the vast majority of its one-billion plus adherents, but also in Islamic history.

<TEXT> You didn't say that, but you're making a false equivalency between Shi'a militias and ISIS/Qaeda. They aren't the same. 

I'm no fan of Shi'a militias as they will often target Sunnis en masse, but they do not copy ISIS tactics nor have they taken slaves nor do they forcibly try to convert people. I can find numerous scholars preaching those things from the Sunni side, even before ISIS ever existed. 

Show me a Shi'a scholar preaching that Sunnis are kafir or that enslaving them or forcibly converting them is ok. The worst you'll likely find is some cursing of the sahaba, which I would agree should be avoided, but even then that in itself is rejected by Iranian and other leading Shi'a authorities.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually, they are the midst of a good run in the CONCACAF Champions League right now! They just upset Pachuca, a Mexican team, becoming one of the few MLS teams to have defeated a Mexican team in a playoff series. [They did so in dramatic fashion, too](http://www.rds.ca/vid%C3%A9os/soccer/impact/porter-joue-les-h%C3%A9ros-3.1117584) with help from [a kid only playing his second professional game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Porter) in front of 60,000 fans at Stade Olympique. This isn't their usual stadium but is being used in the CCL for a larger crowd because Stade Saputo only seats 20,000. They face Costa Rica's Alajuelense in the semifinals. 

While they were in the lower leagues, they had a tremendous upset in the Canadian Cup and surprisingly clinched a berth in the CCL. Via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Impact_%281992%E2%80%932011%29#The_Impact_and_Major_League_Soccer): 

 In 2008, the Montreal Impact won the Canadian Championship, gaining the chance to represent Canada in the CONCACAF Champions League. The tournament features the best teams in all of North and Central America and the Caribbean Islands. The Impact won two legs against Real Estali 10 and 00 to secure a spot in the tournament. Montreal competed then in the group stage where they defeated Joe Public FC of Trinidad 20 and 41 and CD Olimpia of Honduras 21 and 11. They finished off against Atlante FC of Mexico which they tied 00 and then lost 21.

 On February 25, 2009, the team won the first leg of the quarterfinals match 20 against Santos Laguna from Mexico. The match was played at Montreal's Olympic Stadium in front of a club-record crowd of 55,571. The second leg was held on March 5, 2009 at Corona Stadium, in Torreon, Mexico, where the Impact led 21 at the half (41 on aggregate). With the Impact only a few minutes from a semi-final berth, Santos Laguna's Carlos Quintero scored twice in stoppage time to rally the homeside to a 52 victory, thus eliminating the Impact from the inaugural CONCACAF Champions League 54 on aggregate. Following the match, head coach John Limniatis commented that his side "should have done better", noting that it was "unfortunate to finish this way".

Since 2012, the Impact made the playoffs once, in 2013, despite struggling through the second half of the regular season. [They were eliminated in humiliating fashion by Houston 3-0](http://matchcenter.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2013-10-31-houston-dynamo-vs-montreal-impact/recap). 

[They have a nice new stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saputo_Stadium), but their owner, Joey Saputo, is a bit impulsive, having gone through three managers within the team's first three years in the league. Saputo, an Italian-Canadian, also has a reputation for signing Italians, even older ones. Marco Di Vaio, Matteo Ferrari, and Alessandro Nesta have all played here.

The only Italian now is Marco Donadel, who is new this year. Right now their best players are him, Laurent Cimian (Belgian International defender who is also new), Ignacio Piatti (Argentinian, the team's lone designated player, which means he is paid very well) the underrated Justin Mapp, captain Patrice Bernier, new arrival Eric Alexander (also underrated), Jack McInerney and Dilly Duka. 

The season has a lot of question marks as their chief offensive weapon, Di Vaio, has retired, and they already lost to DC United earlier today.* Judging by their CCL performance, they seem to be much improved from last season, where they didn't even make the playoffs. While I don't think they are title contenders, they do have a shot to make the playoffs and surprise some people. Their owner has a willingness to spend some money (he also owns Bologna FC in Italy) and their coach, Frank Klopas, is a veteran coach and player. 

Hope this helps!


* - I mistakenly said they had yet to play. This has been edited.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since you're Brazilian, I'd normally suggest Orlando City, as they have a Brazilian owner and have Kaka. However, while they have invested a lot of money into the club and for all intents and purposes are "big," they are brand new to the league, so there's not really any history. 

As for history, the original teams in the league are Kansas City, Dallas, New York (Red Bulls), Dallas, Colorado, Columbus, DC, Los Angeles, San Jose and New England. LA and DC are the first and second-most successful clubs over MLS's entire history, respectively. LA is considered the league's golden child, having brought David Beckham, Robbie Keane and this summer, Steven Gerrard into the league. They were also home to arguably the best American player of all time in Landon Donovan. 

Seattle, Portland, Vancouver and San Jose trace their lineage back to lower level leagues and leagues from decades past. Seattle is the best-supported team in the league by numbers, drawing the most fans to their stadium each year, and is a very wealthy club despite only being in the league since 2009. Seattle, Portland and Vancouver maintain a regional rivalry where they compete for the Cascadia Cup each year, but the rivalry is fiercest between Portland and Seattle. 

Montreal has long supported soccer, and the Impact have a lower league history as well, but have only been in MLS since 2012. Chicago, while not an MLS original, has been in the league since 1998, but has not been successful in recent years. 

And like any league, there are Brazilian players scattered across different teams. 

Hope this helps! </TEXT>

And you found one supposed false accusation, never mind that there's no web link. Congratulations. 

We have politicians like Bobby Jindal claiming there are no-go zones when that has been debunked. We have people frothing at the mouth when you don't call terrorism "Islamic" or "Muslim," never mind that most of the victims are Muslims, and we have people claiming that Muslims don't condemn terrorism.

When you use words like "savages, shithole countries, pitiful sand covered shithole, and uneducated barbaric savages," you're attacking everybody, not just the extremists, and you alienate everyone else. If someone doesn't feel like their country doesn't accept them, they'll look for acceptance elsewhere. And besides that, don't learn about religion from some news articles about tragedies.

Best to get along with them as best you can and, dare I say it, consider them your fellow citizens and natives. They will have a different color of skin than you and have different names than you. They likely will follow a different religion than you. Deal with it. Because humanity doesn't have a good track record of excluding humans because they "aren't like us."

Talk about youth development! To have the coach who the kids watch every game say something like that  it really changed his life. Now he is nine and playing soccer everyday, five days a week. I know that role model was key part of it. I am forever grateful to that and for that.

<TEXT> Start with two through four in that order, and don't limit yourself when it comes to Islamic scholars. Sunni, Shia, etc. all should be explored. You'll have some issues if you don't know Arabic and Farsi for this, as translated works aren't as widespread as they should be.  

However, most of the world's Muslims don't speak these languages (part of the reason is a lack of education), yet they still understand many concepts both basic and not so basic. Most of the world's extremists either haven't read up or have merely seen the most extreme of sources.

After you've learned a bit from scholars and scripture, you'll be able to get a better picture of what's wrong with extremists. At least I hope so.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That is some of the most severe right wing propaganda that I have ever read. You're taking some kind social media activism as some kind of organized campaign by the radical left, when really it's slacktivism at worst and legitimate activism as best. Your hatred seems to be directed at "social justice," as well as any sort of left leaning ideology. 

They work hand in glove with race-baiters and use ridiculous theories to convince the uneducated that somehow someone else is responsible for their lot in life. They promote debunked Marxist and Communist economics and politics as solutions for the 'injustice' of our society. They erroneously believe confiscation and redistribution of wealth by the government (with special groups like themselves getting a cut) will solve critical fundamental flaws actually caused by poor quality education and the effective dissolution of families, particularly in the black community. And they use every opportunity to shout down anyone who disagrees with them, usually by playing the race card. Assault, defamation, harassment, innuendo, libel and lies, rumor, slander, threats and violence are their tools of the trade - manipulation of the uneducated masses to accede to their wishes (money and power) is their goal.

My God, it's like I'm reading a tea-party manifesto. 

 SJW, race-baiters, and environmentalists are really nothing more than shakedown artists. They vampire ludicrous amounts of resources but contribute nothing positive to society, and are deserving of all the derision and ridicule they get, IMHO.

Yeah, I'm going to just call you a far-right extremist. That's enough internet for me today.  </TEXT>

I don't know if I can convince you of that. Perhaps I can't, but I had to try. Please don't hold prejudice or violence in your heart against Islam.

<TEXT> You're saying that people of different races will never get along, so we should stop trying to live near each other and cut ourselves off as soon as possible. This effectively legitimizes racism. This is the argument that white supremacist groups use today and the argument behind the segregation of old. It seems I have more faith in humanity than you do to live together with equality regardless of race. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  OK. Let's say Spain was had underwent a complete process of Arabization and Islamization. By the 10th century the majority of people on the Iberian peninsula would be Arabic-speaking Iberian Muslims (Muwalladun), the minority actual Arabs or Berbers. Eventually the Muwalladun could have expelled their Arab overlords, but they would not have been able to reclaim their Romance languages. 

Didn't this actually happen?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the 1950s and 60s, after Jim Crow laws were repealed and schools were desegregated, many white families left cities with high black populations and left to the suburbs rather than live alongside black people or have their children go to school with black children. This, coupled with discriminatory housing laws on the books until the 1980s in some cases, has led to a de facto segregation in many areas across the United States. 

Good example of this here, if you have a half hour to spare: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp22YlJlfHo

If you look at a racial breakdown on a map of a major metropolitan area, you'll see stark differences in the racial makeup of certain areas.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Watching the World Cup today, and no mention of the Seattle - Portland game tonight from ESPN. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-14 00:05:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I didn't see a single mention of the Seattle - Portland game on tonight, despite it being from the same family of networks in the same sport. No promotion, no commercials, nothing. Was this the same for everyone else? I live on the East Coast, so there may not have been any promotion because of that reason. Was it the same on the West Coast? 

**EDIT**: Apparently I need to pay closer attention. Way to go ESPN! </TEXT>
