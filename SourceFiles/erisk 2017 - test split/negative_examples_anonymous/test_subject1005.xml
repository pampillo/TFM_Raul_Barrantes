<TEXT> I am so sorry to take up your valuable time on Reddit. But here are the facts of the situation. Bryan Cranston, hot off his Breaking Bad fame, get casted in a new blockbuster where he, and HE ALONE, dominated the trailer. You can defend as much as you want, but it doesn't change the fact it was marketed as though Cranston would be a bigger part of the movie. And why wouldn't they? People like me who have no interest in Godzilla, but have an interest in Break Bad's star would go see the movie. You have not made one concrete point to the contrary. I'm sorry you're annoyed, but your position is tough to defend when there are 30 different trailers you could pull up to prove my point.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> False advertising. At least that's my complaint. If he wasn't such a huge part of the trailer, it wouldn't bug me in the slightest. But it was advertised like he was the star and it is very clear why they did that. For example, it didn't bug me in the slightest that Ben Affleck was killed off immediately in Smokin Aces. Everyone knew he was in it, but it wasn't marketed like he was the star. Huge difference.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be fair, and I'm not suggesting you are doing this, there are A LOT of people who start claiming collusion in some of the sit n go tourneys when they start losing. In a particular hand (you'll have to forgive me as I don't recall specifics), I was dealt small pocket pair like 2s and raised from late position. Big blind called me and it was heads up. Flop was a bunch of faces and he and I checked it down. Turned out he had a smaller pocket pair. But another player,small stacked and not in the hand, started accusing he and I of colluding. I think it may be a way of some players acting out their tilt. In your case, it does sound different however.  </TEXT>

It was pure awesomeness. I have a feeling its the hivemind or anit-michael bay bandwagon at work, because no one outside this site slams that movie like Reddit does.  </TEXT>

I'd give him five bucks if she was or get the movie "Pay Back" starring Mel Gibson on VHS for free if she wasn't. I got to take "Pay Back" home with me that day.

<TEXT> That's what I mean by throw-back. The director was intentionally vague about the timeline. I mean, just the use of cellphones and whatnot, we can deduce it's a modern day movie, but the heavy use of synth music and the old-style movie theater, the cars, the black and white TVs. It was done intentionally to give you wide range of impressions and feelings. I suppose that doesn't work for everyone, but I enjoyed it.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys! First time poster on this sub. I'm a fairly new believer (little over a year or so) and have a question about this word: Elect. Let me preface my question with saying I don't believe God is ever surprised. Therefore it should come as no shock to Him when someone becomes saved. By this thought, you could say that all who are saved are "elect" because God knew they would come to Christ. But then why make the distinction? Why aren't the "elect" just called Christians? It may just be my misunderstanding of the term, but it stings my ears when I hear people say "elect." Even if I, myself, are "elect," I still hate the title. Can someone please explain to me where my misunderstanding is? It would mean a lot. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There has to be some angle in this decision. Surely he's not ACTUALLY thinking he's above Rick's group and their decisions. He still carries the guilt of the people he left to die AND he knows he would be dead if it wasn't for Grimes and Co. So I'm thinking there's another angle that we just aren't seeing yet. Thoughts? </TEXT>
