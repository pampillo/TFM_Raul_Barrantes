Most of our free-trade agreements have increased our trade deficits with other countries. Will TPP reduce this deficit? How can TPP be the most progressive trade bill according to Obama, yet conservative enough for Republicans? Supposedly, all the rules and standards will be enforceable, so companies don't outsource as often and countries with those outsourced jobs have to improve conditions.

I could talk my about my interest for it and write an essay long reasons of why I would deserve it for reasons a,b,c,d, etc. But I want to say that I am a normal yugioh player. I do have cards, of course who wouldn't with all those commons/rares/and the occasional super from the packs. I have a roid deck from when I was younger, cyber, and batteryman deck, so it is not really "meta" per say nor beginner "starter" deck. This is my first 6 ish months of attending locals and I would say that it is a great way to meet new people, have a good time, trade with others, and duel others for enjoyment. It is a great experience, since I couldn't really play casually yugioh with old long time friends, who got away from yugioh with their own niche/interests, etc.

Anyways, you are a great person, who is willing to help other members of the yugioh community. Thanks for your support! (Flattering the person lol)

Business Growth will reach max demand when you have over 100k people with a good mayor rating with many services and high traffic congestion.

<TEXT> Ultra Rare Expressroids - This

Jetroid/Decoyroid/Gyroids maybe your best commons to pick up, since they are wind roid monsters, which matches the theme of speedroids.

Also, any generic anti-synchro cards or generic synchro support cards like tuners, synchrons, synchro monsters like Stardust Dragon, Plant synchros, synchro spells. synchro traps, etc because Konami will probably want the card game to coincide with the Arc-V storyline, where the characters are in the synchro dimension. 

The set won't be out until October, so you still have over the summer to pick up the stuff.

The same people, who claim that Fiscal Deficits do matter, yet there might be link between trade and fiscal deficits. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_deficit_hypothesis

"The twin deficits hypothesis, also called the double deficit hypothesis or twin deficits anomaly, is a macroeconomic proposition that there is a strong link between a national economy's current account balance and its government budget balance"

Of course, the national deficit has been dropping while we continue trade deficits at the moment.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> TPP is good because we need to trade with countries with rules written by the EXPERTS, which are 90%+ of economists and big corporations. If 95% of scientists say that climate change is real, then economists must be right. Also, it is secret to ensure that we can get the best trade deal possible and don't lose. You know... Nobody loses in trade remember? (Comparative Advantage!) Also trade deficits don't matter because as long as consumers are happy with lower prices and we are exporting, then it is a win win situation. Cmon... Does anybody really want higher prices on goods and want a short run recession by blocking trade especially with the growing economies in the Pacific, which we already trade with? We will combat their growth with more trade with rules to hinder their growth, which they don't even know :D. Even Budget Deficits don't matter as long you invest in a country. You know... After World War 1, Germany had to export so many goods and consumer can't consumer as many goods with hyperinflation to repay its debt to the winners? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The USA engaged in trade, but was very protectionist until the Great Depression and World Wars throughout our industrial revolution. 

Our Free-Trade agreements has increased our trade deficits throughout many decades. Should we continue to have negative trade deficits? According to many, "trade deficits don't matter." supposedly. 

China has some protectionist tariffs on US made goods, while we have low tariffs on Chinese goods. I highly doubt any country such as India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Thailand, etc have 0% tariffs on our goods. 

We subsidize our agriculture industry to the point that made Mexican agriculture nearly uncompetitive and caused many displaced workers to immigrate to America illegally. 

Outsourcing and Automation has played a major part in the deindustrialization of one industry cities in the Midwest. 

Overspecialization of certain economic sectors can be bad for any country, if something external happens.
Remember: Alberta's Recent Oil Troubles, since US stopped buying as much of Canadian oil? 

http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/flowchart/2011/06/30/why-us-companies-arent-so-american-anymore

How is it that we are worried about China's economic growth, yet we already engage in Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China? We are concerned about and have been aiding their growth, yet somehow TPP will somehow curb China's power according to John Boehner, Obama, etc? 

How is TPP the most "progressive" trade deal for Obama, yet conservative enough for Republicans in Congress? If TPP will make trade in level terms, then there isn't as much of a comparative advantage incentive, so..... How does that actually work?

<TEXT> I agree. Over-specialization can bad. Look what happened to Detroit, when automation and outsourcing happened. If any major war. financial crisis, or whatever happens between the US and other countries, we wouldn't have the facilities to produce our own goods. We would be hit with a recession first, if that happens, since other countries would block imports to us. Prices will rise for all of us. In reality, nobody knows what the true cost of goods are, since there are so many external factors.

It is interesting though. Could the USA should export more goods than imports in goods to pay down our trillions of dollars of debt?

USA should outsource most of its manufacturing and shift to high tech!. trade deficits don't matter. Because consumers gains + our money is reinvested in capital will come back to the USA.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No it won't. Free-Trade lifts all boats. Consumers can buy stuff at a cheaper price. Without Trade, your goods will cost a lot more and you will have less choices to choose from. That is why the agreement is secret, so we have to get the best trade offer out there, which lifts all boats overall. There are no losers and trade deficits don't matter because..... you just imported more goods than you export, which means consumers are having a lot of choices. 

Back in the 1920s, when manufacturing jobs were present, how come nobody wanted blacksmithing jobs back?
Why make stuff for our own usage when we can just get items from other places for cheap? We need to depend on other growing economies for our growth. :)

<TEXT> "i think the congestion of highways has far more to do with an increased supply of motor vehicles as opposed to increased supply of highways" 

Cars are unusable, if nobody rides them. If the overall economy gains more cars, not everybody is using all the cars. Transportation is the act of people going from place to place. Once highways are more open, congestion and time travel would be less, which in turn decreases usage of commuter rail + public transit, which moves those people onto the highways. That is induced demand. There is no point in public transit because the lifestyle is already revolved around cars. Yes, if you live in an area with population not growing and build bigger highways, yes there will be less congestion.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yet, America was more socialist when our grandparents were young in the 1930s to 1950s. 

NASA was a socialist program to defeat Soviet Union's Capitalist space program. 

Marginal Income Tax Rates were above 90% on the wealthy.

!950s had the largest infrastructure spending in our nation's history with the interstate highways, which would cost 1/2 to 1 trillion dollars in today's money.  </TEXT>

Spell Card - Field Spell

You can normal summon "roid" machine-type monsters without tributing. "Roid" Monsters can target their own monsters for attacks. When they do, the attacking monster gains 300 ATK and the battling monsters are not destroyed by battle. If this card is destoryed by a card effect, you can add 1 "roid" card from your deck to your hand.

For the second point, Are you suggesting that current path of America's trade policy should continue without any reforms or changes? </TEXT>

<TEXT> America built an economy up until World War 2 with heavy tariffs, growing unions, and lots of exports. 

You can argue on either end of the spectrum. It seems like the problem is the trade deficit. It is not protectionism vs free-trade. A little more protectionism could reduce the deficit and in return increase exports. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wouldn't it makes sense to reduce outsourcing incentivized first and increase competition in the markets so companies don't get as much profit to automate as quickly. Since we have an increase in small businesses, those businesses can't buy capital as fast as big businesses. Also a reduction in the labor supply by reducing the amount of new immigrant labor and an increase in unionization would push up wages as well. These should all go into effect before the min wage actually increases. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Driving in the United States has a very inelastic demand, so when prices increase by a certain %, the reduction in demand % falls less relative to the price % increase because most Americans live in areas without good public transit nor have jobs within walking distance. Hence, why people are so concerned when prices increase because it affects them a lot and can't change it. Some might get discouraged to drive as result of the gas prices increase. Those people will take public transit, which in turn increases ridership revenues via fares. Fare Increases in the MBTA to pay for the system itself would discourage and reduce ridership because city people can take taxis, walk to their jobs, carpool, buy a care, take UBER, etc. Most economists agree that raising the gas tax can be a very efficient policy.  

In Europe or other developed countries, Gas Prices are currently in many places 50% more or even double than our gas prices via very high gas taxes. Their roads and mass transit are better than ours.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Designated Hitter in the National League or Having only a 8 man lineup is the easiest solution. Also, it would uniform the whole league in its rules. 

You could also wait decades to fix the low offense game, but every sport has made changes to its rules since its inception. Baseball rules have been altered throughout history. The game of the 1890s and 1920s is different from today's. What is interesting is that we had more offense and shorter games decades ago. 

There are other methods that would be more drastic:

Changing the Baseball's Matter, Alter the Bat's matter, Bring the Fences in, Treat all Fouls as nothing against the batter, Lower the Pitcher's Mound,

<TEXT> I think that the people, who left Yugioh because of Pendulum Summoning, should just watch the anime. It is literally very dramatic and can easily top as one of the best Yugioh Series.

<TEXT> I recommend 5Ds because the style of yugioh is similar to the current metagame. Also, the images are better than GX and the Original. The 5D's rock song is similar to GX's theme song. GX and Original Yugioh are also a good series to watch. I don't recommend Zexal, if you just got back. The presentation of Zexal is not great.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is cheaper to buy the box, when the set intially comes out because you get more cards for the Nekroz deck and/or for other decks. Also, since there is a limited supply, when it comes out, the singles will cost abe worth a lot. Don't buy singles, when it intially comes out because the prices will decrease as the supply increases. Buy singles, if you know that market has hit its minimum value. Over time, if that particular deck does well against other decks, demand will rise faster than supply, which cause Singles to be high in value again. If that is the case, just the buy box. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Keep the Shift. Strategy makes the game interesting because the defense is not stagnant in the same positions. 

If MLB wanted more runs and offense, Put the DH in the National League. An average MLB pitcher is almost 85%+ a guaranteed out. They are worse than the worst actual batter in any lineup.

If you want drastic changes to rules to boost offense, How about don't count all fouls as strikes? Why 2 strikes and a foul = nothing happens, yet first 2 fouls = strikes? Why not have all fouls = strikes to speed up the game? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The players threathen strike, but they know that a strike will tremendously affect the whole league in a negative way.

The league does need to reform its parity, rules, free agency, and money. If the league takes a loss this year, projected growth says that the league will continue to grow, so taking debt now, won't necessarily impact the league finances in the long-term.

<TITLE> What to do when Residential, Commercial, and Industrial Demand are all negative? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-12 00:26:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My central city used to be mostly $$, $$$, and some $ people with manufacturing, high-tech, and $$ and $$$ businesses. It had good schools and good health services. I have neighboring cities with 100% $ people, $ business, and dirty. Then suddenly, $ people started rising and a lot of $$ and $$$ businesses +apartments started to decay or abandon. Jobs weren't demanded. Commute Time increasing. Budget was in free-fall....

To combat this:

1. I did readjust taxes in all my neighboring cities with 20% taxes on everything except dirty to encourage them to move to my major city. 

2. My city was in financial disaster. Budget Deficits and Low Cash. I decreased all residential taxes down to 4% to encourage people to come. Increased the Commercial and Industrial Taxes to around 11%. Slashed funding to health, police, ordinances. Ran on a surplus for some months. Slowly restored police and health funding. Took out 2 loans to get me to $500,000 in cash and roughly 1k to 2k budget deficit.

Now, my finances are in order mostly with positive demand for $ and $$ residential, but how I do actually grow and increase demand for industry and commercial? Any tips?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "The Left hates the automobile because the automobile represents individual freedom and the Left hates freedom of any sort."

No. Most Democrats support manufacturing and domestic car manufacturing. To say that Liberals hate cars, isn't really the case. You may oppose a gas tax increase because it is a tax increase. Sure. People that want a gas tax increase to promote efficiency and pay the true cost of driving as stated in the article.

"For the leftist's ideal world, the roads would be reserved for government bureaucrats and leftist leaders while the disregarded masses would walk or take some form of overcrowded, filthy public transport."

Traffic tends to get really bad in city centers. Discouraging car usage is a good way to free up roadways. Freeing up Roadways increases car usage, so it is very inelastic in demand for car travel, which is good for slight tax increase because the deadweight loss is low. Look in the other countries with high gas taxes, people use public transit a lot and their infrastructure is considerably better than ours in many aspects. 

Yes, it will move some to public transit. Improving Public Transit and Putting Riders into Public Transit allows the government to make some revenues off of it. Also, it is environmentally friendly, since more people are placed in vehicles, so we don't waste excess energy in traffic or driving in excess to places, where you could have walked, take a bike, etc.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not really. He should concede on Keystone, so Obama can have some agreement with the Republican Party on energy. Energy Production and Energy Extraction has been increasing under Obama's watch and it is helping the economy. Environmental Efficiency has been increasing as well. Politically, I can foresee Republicans using this potential veto in a a campaign to claim that Obama is "Anti-American Energy". During that last campaign cycle, Republicans used Keystone to claim Obama is anti-energy even though energy production has been increasing under his watch.

If Obama wanted to be bold, he should rather his position on TPP. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bad Idea. I am pretty left on environmental issues, but I do know that more energy production and infrastructure is a good thing for America. 

Obama shouldn't veto Keystone. He should instead sign Keystone XL to show some bipartisanship. Why?

Republicans can't campaign against nor attack Obama on energy issues because they can't claim that Obama is anti-energy or his polices such as Keystone are the cause of rising gas prices. If gas prices start to rise in the next months and Obama did veto Keystone, How will Democrats, Liberals, and Obama respond to Republican Congress's claim that Obama is causing prices to rise?

Even if an Environmental Disaster occurs from Keystone, Obama can easily blame the GOP. After all, GOP wanted Keystone XL more than Democrats.  

Even though environmentalists will get angry from this, at least you will rally the base in 2016 and give candidates a chance to differentiate from the previous administration.  </TEXT>

By the way, our infrastructure is a 3 trillion dollar problem. </TEXT>

Here is how it was spent:

The infrastructure spending within the Stimulus is just minor patch to a major problem. Of course, we can't fix every problem, but less than 100 billion to fix a 3.6 trillion dollar problem isn't enough. </TEXT>

<TEXT> How does an ad hominem attack on Obama address Bernie's concern on infrastructure?

Obama's Stimulus was basically 1/3 Tax Cuts. 1/3 Health + Education + Unemployment Benefits. 1/3 Random other Government Spendings. 

http://projects.nytimes.com/44th_president/stimulus?ref=economicstimulus

Infrastructure Spending was only around 40 to 75 billion dollars in total depending on the definition of "infrastructure" in your own opinion.

It also provided some funding to build High Speed Rail, but most of the cash went to California, since states with Republican Governors rejected federal aid. 

By the way, repairing all infrastructure costs would cost 3.6 trillion dollars according to the American Society of Civil Enginners.

http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/

Clearly, the stimulus provided only minor patches to a major problem.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think it is the case with Mexico in NAFTA.

1. Mexican Illegal Immigration hasn't slowed as a result from NAFTA, even though promoters of the trade deal said so. People, who don't like manufacturing and are former farmers, migrated to America. 

I don't need evidence, since conservatives have been complaining about the increase in illegal immigration for awhile now.

2. Mexican Government isn't stable. The area is very hostile, violent, corrupt, and there is no signs of standard of living improvement.

I don't need evidence to prove this because there has been many gangs, violence, etc reported from the area. It is already widely known that Mexico has a lot of violent problems. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If we continue with this "free-trade" process, soon we will sign free-trade agreements with every country to bring all countries's domestic prices to world price equilibrium. 

If all Domestic Prices are equal to the World Price, then what happens next? There is no gains from trade since every opportunity cost of creating a good somewhere else in the world is equal.

Usually, in free-trade agreements is basically abolishing national borders and national protectionism without actually abolishing sovereign borders itself.

Since, Free-Trade is so good. Shouldn't America be attempting to sign free-trade agreements with China, Russia, Iran, African Union, etc to allow low tariffs, easy transfer of laborers, etc?

Clearly, if we do so with those "hostile" or underdeveloped or growing countries, we could ease tensions, produce goods at lower costs over there, and "contain" the growing markets by making our businesses invest over there. </TEXT>

From wikipedia "Automobile manufacturing became the largest industry segment in the US, and the largest ever created; the US auto industry was many times larger than the automotive industries of the rest of the world combined.[2] By 1960, one-sixth of working Americans were employed directly or indirectly by the industry, but automation and imports eroded the need for such a large workforce within a couple of decades. The 1950s were the pinnacle of American automotive manufacturing and helped shape the United States into an economic superpower." 

Of course, you can claim that wikipedia is not a primary source, but it does have source links on itself. It still summarizes the details well enough to understand the basic point. 

There, you have all the citations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. Our Agriculture Businesses were able to put some Mexican Agriculture businesses out of the market. Those workers had to either work in the factories or find some other opportunities. Many come illegally in search of better opportunities. Since NAFTA, Mexican economic/social climate, the new manufacturing jobs and social conditions aren't better than jobs and social conditions that they had before. 

2. You are talking about the producer and consumer surpluses, right? I understand that. It is just a transfer of welfare. If migration doesn't harm the US or Mexico, why do conservatives complain about the mass migration illegals?

3. For your third point, if you look at the graph, the trade deficit increased throughout the mid to late 1990s. In 1995, after we past NAFTA, we started to have a negative trade balance. It is -15,808.3 (add in the graph's key) compared to +1,349.8 (add in the graph's key) in 1994. Every year since to now, it has grown to -67,000 at its height. Those are HUGE number differences.

"It only ballooned in the 2000's, so tough to blame Clinton for this, right?"

Also, Clinton, Some Pro-Trade Democrats, and the majority of Republicans in Congress past NAFTA. I only blame the policy, but people, who agreed on it, each share a piece of the blame. 

4. Ya. Obviously, if you allow trade without guidelines, tariffs, quotas, etc. Then, businesses will obviously outsource. I agree with your next statement. 

5. Yes. Also, true, but it also causes a huge economic declines in the Rust Belt of America.

6. Most manufacturing jobs were already unionized and were middle class jobs in the 20th century. In order for the workers to compete, they would have to reduce their wages and cut benefits, which in turn made them lower class. Some had to leave to retail jobs, which have less pay than their manufacturing jobs.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "compassionate conservative might see the social problems of the United States, such as health care or immigration, as issues that are better solved through cooperation with private companies, charities and religious institutions rather than directly through government departments." - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compassionate_conservatism

You are using a hard-core definition of what it means for a conservative to be a RINO. George Bush was Neo-Con as well. Patriot Act, Illegal Spying, Tripling the Deficit, etc came with the need to fight wars in Afghanistan and the fear of WMDs in Iraq. Cutting Taxes is also a conservative position, which reduced expected increases in revenues, which in combination with military spending, created more deficits. We do not have Open Borders with Mexico. We do have one with Canada. "Big Government" was the result of increased military spending and general increases in revenue/spending based on population growth. 

George Bush is still an establishment conservative, but more moderate leaning on some issues than the typical modern conservative. As evident in this link:

<TEXT> It is worth to have a discussion because economic policy is always debateable. After all, since free-trade is so beneficial, Shouldn't America negotiate more free-trade agreements with India, African Union, more South American Countries, Russia, Iran, Iraq, etc? Every country has a comparative advantage is something, right? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think people have the wrong definition of populism.

Populists are people, who are economically liberal and socially conservative. 

Progressives/Liberal are people, who are economically liberal and socially liberal.

Note: There were Progressive Republicans in the early 20th century to mid 20th century. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree. Gore, Clinton, and HW Bush pushed the idea that NAFTA will create more jobs, end illegal immigration, increase American exports. These are lies. The American Trade Deficit increased with Mexico. illegal Immigration increased. Manufacturing Jobs declined throughout the 90s.  I know where these Pro-Free experts get their evidence from. It appears in any economics textbook with this simple graph. Of course, the majority of economists are pro-trade. Some are pro-protectionism.

<TEXT> I have taken a course in economics. American Produces lose some Producer Surplus because they can't compete with low prices of the world market. American Consumers gain Consumer Surplus because they can get cheaper goods. The producer surplus loss and the consumer surplus gain is basically a transfer of surplus within the original economy. The consumers, who can access cheaper goods below equilibrium now from trade, adds to the consumer surplus. It is shown by the triangle in the graph.

http://welkerswikinomics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/gains-from-trade_2.jpeg

Of course, I think those economics textbooks promote that free-trade "can" improve surpluses/welfare/etc

They cite tariffs as causing more dead-weight losses and hinder ability to a competitive free-trade market. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Supposedly in economics, if the World Production Costs and Price of goods are lower than America's production and product prices, then free-trade actually benefits the consumers of America through trade. Consumers could expand overall surplus. The American producers are the ones, who will suffer.

<TITLE> How to survive and get out of a budget crisis/economic recession? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-25 23:30:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I recently got out of my budget crisis/recession. I borrowed a lot for economic growth earlier in the game 10 times of $200,000. In the crisis, I tried to cut services and raise taxes. Basically, I used 20% on everything except for low income residential, low income business, and high tech. For spending, I cut education, police, healthcare, parks, and roads. I maintained power, fire, water, trash, and public transit.  I used a lot of "weaknesspays" to maintain surpluses, if I went into the negative range. Now, I got out of the big time crash with some BIG time business boom, since I had 90,000+ people before and after this mess.

I want to know your plan of action. How do you survive your crisis?  </TEXT>
