<TEXT> One of the inhibitors I feel when thinking of starting a business of my own is my age (I'm 40), I feel like the ramp up of a business would take too long to pay off relative to my rather good paying job.  How long has it taken you to get your businesses self-sufficient?  (I believe they call this "crossing the valley of death.")

<TEXT> We should be able to respond to users without our usernames being visible.  We can send messages from the subreddit, but we can't respond to modmail this way. If you're explaining the official stance of the subreddit to a hostile user I don't see why your username is important. (The number of users who argue that the rules should not apply to them is too damn high!) It's just a way for users better target individual mods.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree, actually, the admins need to actually do something, most of the time there is just no response.  having a fully open mod log would allow bad actors to laser focus on the person who just enforced a rule.  This already happens way too much.  If you respond to a mod mail to explain why something was removed, even though you didn't do the removal, you can end up being comment stalked, and doxxed. 

I think there is a disconnect because users don't see the incredibly hostile messages the mods of big subreddits constantly get.  We have constant reminders of how terrible people can be. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wicking is a balance between gravity (the density of the fluid) and the surface adhesion of for the wick.  Trees are essentially ground water wicks that bring water to their leaves. Since water has a high affinity for cellulose, trees can grow quite tall!  But that's not your question.

If we are looking for an unwickable liquid, we would want high weight, and strong cohesive forces.  Off the top of my head, mercury fits this.  Mercury will spread out on certain metal surfaces, like aluminum, but it is actually dissolving the metal in the process, which would make for a poor wick!  It doesn't spread on normally found materials like wood, or plastic or glass.

Another possibility would be fluorocarbons, since they tend to repel both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Subreddit Policy Changes: New Rules for Headlines and Link Flair </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-11 20:30:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi everyone,

A constant complaint we've had is the sensationalism of headlines, we've discussed the issue, and we're going to start enforcing some new rules for headlines.
 In addition to the [existing rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/rules#wiki_submission_rules), we're adding these.

**Headlines may not:**

  - **ask a question** (anything with a '?') Linked articles which have a question in the title should be re-written to describe the content of the paper in keeping with our existing rules against editorializing and sensationalizing.

  - **make claims of resolving a long standing issue/cure/mystery.**

  -  **use an exclamation point.**

  - **makes general statements about large groups** (e.g. "men don't trust women", "Doctors hate him") The headline should indicate the group that the finding applies to.

  - **have a list mentioned.** (e.g. top 10 things you must read)

  - **makes reference to the thoughts or feelings of the reader.**  (e.g. "You'll never expect this")

  - **contain the word "[Video]" or related terms** (since we don't allow videos, linking to a page that contains a video is not allowed.)


**All Submission must have flair assigned**

The mods have been assigning appropriate flair to unflaired submissions, but we are no longer going to do this.  Unflaired submissions will be removed.  There will be 5 minutes of time to flair a post, after which it will be subject to removal, with notification.

If you have additional thoughts on how to make more specific headline rules or add rules, we'd like to hear them.  We will be testing things out and we may make changes as needed. 

Thanks!

<TEXT> We put things in the orbit of Mars, so that's possible.  

Jupiter is so massive that they probably have to make sure to avoid probes getting dragged into it's orbit.  

I believe there is a probe hanging around Saturn.

Uranus and Neptune were fly-bys?  (I'm asking, I can't recall.) 

I wonder how far off from possible an orbital probe out there is.  

I suspect the real reason is money, there just isn't much that having something in orbit of Pluto would accomplish vs a fly-by and the cost is probably a lot higher. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The concern that started the whole thing is with a surfactant called SLS, sodium lauryl sulfate, which is in a lot of things.  It's a strong surfactant, and some people are sensitive to it, although most people don't notice.   It will "dry out" your skin, which in this instance is a touch misleading becuase it's not removing water, it's removing the stearic acid (which is similar to wax) from your skin.  Without the oily layer in your skin, moisture escapes, and your skin gets flaky. 

In order for SLS to do this, it has to get into your skin, the micelle formed by SLS is quite smaller, and it can slip into the pores, for some people this is worse than others.

Another surfactant, SLES, sodium laureth sulfate, is similar in structure, but it has a few ethylene oxide units between the carbon chain and the sulfate group.  It turns out this is hugely important to the irritation profile.  Those groups make the micelle of the SLES much bigger, and they don't enter the skin nearly as much, hence they are far less irritating.  Now, SLES doesn't foam as well, adn people like foam, even though it has nothing to do with cleaning.  So to increase foam in SLES shampoos, some companies add SLS or Cocoamidylpropyl betaine, which is a foaming agent (it's glorified coconut oil, all of these things are.)

As it turns out, the SLES and betaine conbine to make the shampoo even less irritating, depending on the "sulfate-free" shampoo, it may be significantly less irritating that the sulfate-free (this is the case if the shampoo uses an alpha-olefin sulfonate surfactant.)

So there is not problem with SLES, but it's a "sulfate" so now people think it's terrible...even though they don't know why. It's fine, unless you're a statistically trivial group that has unusual sensitivity, then you should not care.

Shampoo is also so much better than it was in the 70's, but ignore all the sulfate-free stuff, it's just marketing trying to sell you something.

Also, laundry detergent way more interesting than you are guessing, it's not just soap and water, there are about 50 different stains that are tested for and small changes can have huge effects on cleaning.

No, my company wasn't paid to do the study.  I'm an industrial chemist, I'm basically an on-staff expert, marketing wanted to look at it.  That's how business is done, sometimes things don't pan out.

Also, I no longer work for that company, and that company doesn't need protection anyway, it was Dow Chemical.

Now, I hope everyone of you will kindly disclose where you work, what you have worked on, and for good measure, a summary of your investments.  We all want to know what hypothetical conflicts of interest (as defined by people who have no idea what makes a conflict of interest) people have.  Just so we're on a level playing field.

If you're not willing to do this, I suggest we drop the matter.

<DATE> 2015-07-07 00:06:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We would like to talk about what our values are, what we are currently doing, and where we are going in the years to come, and why we support reddit.


**Our Core Values**

Our overarching goal is to bring science education to the public. We have set up outreach programs that help to get more people involved in science and to bring science to a level that can be understood and appreciated by people from every educational background.

To this end, we have invested enormous amounts of time working with scientists, working with science advocates, talking with public policy groups and so on; all with the intent of setting up a platform where people can come, discuss and learn about science. We are trying to break down the 'ivory towers' of science, so that those that are practicing science aren't living outside of the public. While this is no easy task, we are fortunate to be enabled by reddit as a platform. We are not here, spending this much time day-in and day-out just because we love science or because we care about reddit alone, but more because it is an incredibly powerful tool that we have that allows us to really make a difference. How often can you say that you are able to just go in and ask a question of Monsanto scientists? Or read about the newest, hottest research and see people from every walk of life discussing it, and explaining its scientific intricacies and real-world applications? Nowhere else on the internet offers that, and it's something we worked very hard to achieve - hence why we care so much and why we strongly support reddit.

*We believe in the scientific method.* As such, we support the peer-review process which provides the most basic test of validity through testing of ideas and speaking through data. We are not the arbiter of science, simply a venue for the presentation of peer-reviewed research.

*We believe in authenticity.* In this day of information availability, the truth always comes out, its best to speak honestly about what you know and make your case from that.

*We believe in civil discussion.*  The issues brought up by scientific findings arent always what people would like them to be, and controversial topics abound.  We believe that civil conversation is the best way to understand others point of view. One can disagree without being disagreeable, in the end we all agree far more than we disagree, and it isnt always a win-lose situation.

**How We Promote Outreach**

  *Links* 

We allow our users to post links to summaries of peer-reviewed scientific journal article from the last 6 months. Science journalists are professional communicators of scientific information, and they are able to put the research findings into context for the reader who would otherwise struggle to follow the jargon and other technical language found in the primary literature. Our users are then able to engage in conversations about the research findings in the comment section, asking questions and answering them so that we can all better understand the significance of the research (or insignificance as the case may be.)

*Science Discussions* 

Active posters in /r/science who have formal training or conduct research in some scientific disciplines have the opportunity to confirm their expertise with the forum moderators. We 'flair' these users so that you can identify (a) their academic degree and (b) their self-proclaimed research discipline and expertise. In exchange for acknowledging these users, we expect them to contribute constructively to the community.  We allow our flaired users to post their own summaries of a particular subject they believe to be worthy of discussion.  The flaired user/scientist can then directly interact with other users and answer questions they may have in order to put research into better context.  This is useful if a particular field of science is generating important findings, but they are not easily encapsulated by one particular publication.  This also allows for the non-scientist users to actually engage with a scientist working in that field, something they might never get the chance to do in their normal life.

*Ask Me Anything* 

AMAs are well known on reddit, but in /r/science we seek to bring scientists from many different fields who perhaps have no exposure to reddit. This gives our scientist users a chance to ask complicated technical questions of people who are making news in their field, and for non-scientist users to ask questions they have always wondered about, as well as reading about how scientists approach a problem and what science actually is (the continual testing of ideas.)


**Where We Are Going**

*Industrial Scientist AMAs*

Professional scientists typically work in three sectors:  Academia, Government, Non-profit organizations and Industry.  

We have had the good fortune to have access to many people from academia, non-profits and government labs, but the public discourse with industrial scientists has been virtually non-existent.  Many in society discount the views of industrial scientist because of the bias caused by having a financial stake in the research, and many in industry are concerned about public disclosures for legal reasons, be that the threat of being sued or being fired for saying the wrong thing.  Evidence can be presented for both of these sides, and that is why we find ourselves where we are now:  *a huge portion of the scientists in our society being closed out of conversations.*

We would like to change this, and bring more industrial AMAs, however it will take bravery and understanding on the part of everyone, but we think that the benefit of having an open discussion about the science of the products and services we interact with the most in life is worth it.  

You saw this beginning with our hosting of an [AMA with Fred Perlak from Monsanto]( https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3b6mr4/science_ama_series_im_fred_perlak_a_long_time/), who came answer your questions in as forthright manner as possible.  We know that a large number of people mistrust a Monsanto employee, and assign nefarious motivations to him.  We were pleased to read a civil discussion between concerned people, which did not concentrate on the bombastic extremes that are so often found in these interactions.

In the coming months we hope to bring you more scientists from companies that make the things you use, so that you, our readers, can better understand what it is they do and how they do science; we hope that people will reserve their judgment and listen.  Likewise, we hope that businesses will realize that cutting off communication with the public has not been good for our culture, and a different way forward is not to be feared due to hypothetical legal concerns.


*Current and Future Employment*

Many of our readers are students, and a big concern for students in science is finding their place in the world. For employers, having new graduates with the skills that are needed is critical. Properly identifying the current and future needs for skills in the sciences and related fields (like engineering and math) is important for everyone.  Having skilled people who cant find a job doesnt help anyone.  We will seek to bring AMAs and other related content to our readers, that way they can help figure out exactly what they should do.  Sometimes it helps to just ask someone!  While some students have the opportunity to ask people around them, and the large majority dont. (I know I didnt!)  We would like to do something about this.


**/r/science Supports reddit**

I mention all of these things because we can't do any of it without the platform that reddit provides.  This is a unique place that has allowed us to connect people interested in science, scientists and even random people who just show up. Without the reddit platform, it would not be possible to fulfill our goals of scientific outreach and we would not be able to communicate science to the broader internet community effectively. 

We welcome your civil input on this, and we are listening to you.

<TEXT> Too many hypotheticals, I work in concrete reality as much as possible, and the fact of the matter, as people are realizing, is there isn't a real alternative to reddit currently, making it a moot point.  

For me reddit is a means to an end, I'm  not doing this for personal glory, I'm motivated by science outreach, and dispelling myths about science.  

Every time I read something about antivaxxers or other clearly false things, it motivates me to do something about it, this is my doing something. 


As such, I need a wide audience of non-scientists to have a chance to read the content I arrange for, which means having non-science content intermixed, which is reddit.

See the issue?

<TEXT> Hey, I'm the mod in green here, I did the screen capture,of course, and shared it with some groups to explain the situation better.

This was the exchange that pretty much precipitated /r/science going private, as you can read, it's not about Victoria being fired, although we completely disagree with that action.

The issue here is one of communication and respect.  We don't treat our users like this when they message /r/science with questions, even when they start off by calling us traitors, or any of a lovely grab bag of insults.

When went public to break the stonewalling we were getting because we needed to finish setting up an important AMA and we had one day before the holiday to do so, time was critical.  We as mods really need to have prompt communication with the admins when we have issues, generally speaking we work independently and can handle almost everything, if it's gone past that, it's important.

As for the Science AMAs, I have always run them basically independently of the admins, I worked with Victoria to handle follow requests from our guests who wanted analytics on how many people viewed this AMA (totally reasonable requests.)  We don't have access to that information (I would love to have it!)

Given the frustration of the mods contacting the admins with questions, and our miserable success rate (it's not just science mods), I can't ethically refer our guests to an anonymous email address that I don't have any reason to believe will respond, and I don't have the bandwidth to put the requests in myself, so it puts me in a really bad position going forward, and that upset me.

As many of you noticed, /r/science was brought back public before any of the other defaults, this was because we had accomplished our goal of forcing a change in the communication behavior of the admins.  This being our only goal, we did not see a benefit to further disrupting the lives of our readers, a vast majority of whom do not care about reddit politics.

I take the admins at their word that they will be making an attempt to change (kn0thing seems to have come around as well), we have put a lot of work into making reddit a great source of science information, we want it to succeed.  


As for the Hawking AMA, I found the contact information independently, and arranged for the AMA to go forward.  It will be posted on Tuesday morning, we are quite excited.

Thanks,

Nate </TEXT>

<TEXT> I fully support this decision to shut down /r/IAmA, letting Victoria go is a slap.

To back this up, I am the mod in /r/science that organizes all of the science AMAs, and I am going to have meaningful problems in the /r/Science AMAs, Victoria was the only line of communication with the admins.  If someone wants to get analytics for an AMA the answer will be "Sorry, I can't help."  

Dropping this on all of us in the AMA sphere feels like an enormous slap to those of us who put in massive amounts of time to bring quality content to reddit. 

I personally feel like shutting /r/science down as well, that's how much of a bad taste this leaves. </TEXT>

The fact is, I have spent months vetting this AMA, and we know who Fred is, I have contacts within the company and outside who give me information off the record, all of them say Fred is the guy to do this.

All of the political stuff just tells me he can think on his feet, everyone knows he represents Monsanto, that's a given, but he is a scientist, not a MBA or a marketing person.  He may not be in lab now but he did his time which makes him one of us. </TEXT>

All high-level scientists at science-based companies take on a public outreach function, that's how it is.  Of course this is about public relations, any public interaction necessarily is, that's the definition of talking to the public.

Referring to veiled "credentials" also doesn't get you far here, users with credentials have flair stating such, which you have none.

<TEXT> I think we can be pretty sure that Monsanto's goal isn't to drive Indian farmers to commit suicide.  The whole concept doesn't pass the sniff test, it's just far to hyperbolic.

From one of the links:

For example, a 2012 paper in The Lancet that surveyed Indias suicide mortality rate noted: Studies from south India have shown that the most common contributors to suicide are a combination of social problems, such as interpersonal and family problems and financial difficulties, and pre-existing mental illness.

So yeah, blaming GMO seeds for every suicide by a farmer since the mid-1990's is beyond misleading, it's unethical. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Tomorrow's AMA with Fred Perlak of Monsanto- Some Background and Reminders </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-26 03:23:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For those of you who aren't aware, tomorrow's Science AMA is with Dr. Fred Perlak of Monsanto, a legit research scientist here to talk about the science and practices of Monsanto.

First, thanks for your contributions to make /r/science one of the largest, if not the largest, science forums on the internet, we are constantly amazed at the quality of comments and submissions.

We know this is an issue that stirs up a lot of emotion in people which is why we wanted to bring it to you, it's important, and we want important issues to be discussed openly and in a civil manner.

Some background:  

**I approached Monsanto about doing an AMA**, Monsanto is not involved in manipulation of reddit comments to my knowledge, and I had substantial discussions about the conditions we would require and what we could offer.

We require that our AMA guests be scientists working in the area, and not PR, business or marketing people. We want a discussion with people who do the science.

We offer the guarantee of civil conversation.  Internet comments are notoriously bad; anonymous users often feel empowered to be vicious and hyperbolic.  We do not want to avoid hard questions, but one can disagree without being disagreeable.  Those who cannot ask their questions in a civil manner (like that which would be appropriate in a college course) will find their comments removed, and if warranted, their accounts banned.  /r/science is a serious subreddit, and this is a culturally important discussion to have, if you can't do this, it's best that you not post a comment or question at all.

Normally we restrict questions to just the science, since our scientists don't make business or legal decisions, it's simply not fair to hold them accountable to the acts of others.

However, to his credit, Dr. Perlak has agreed to answer questions about both the science and business practices of Monsanto because of his desire to directly address these issues.  Regardless of how we personally feel about Monsanto, we should applaud his willingness to come forward and engage with the reddit user base.

The AMA will be posted tomorrow morning, with answers beginning at 1 pm ET to allow the user base a chance to post their questions and vote of the questions of other users.  

We look forward to a fascinating AMA, please share the link with other in your social circles, but when you do please mention our rules regarding civil behavior.

Thanks again, and see you tomorrow.

<TEXT> I am a mod for science and AskScience, and we are aware of this issue.

This is one of the reasons we have flaired users, you can judge how relevant their expertise is, or if they have any at all.  The general user doesn't have the background to judge the quality of the references or the argument, so they aren't using that.  Flair gives them something else factual to go by.

Further, if on of our flaired users tells us as comment is inaccurate, we delete the entire comment thread.  It doesn't matter how many votes the comment has.  We can't be experts in everything, but at this point we have experts available covering almost everything.

<TEXT> The Cayman Islands have two industries:  international banking and turtle farming.  The banking part clearly doesn't factor in here, but how important are the efforts of the turtle breeding program there?  Is this a drop in the bucket or a huge aspect?

If any one is interested in the turtle farm, [here is their website](http://www.turtle.ky/) </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was a much younger chemist, I briefly considered research in to antimalarial drugs on a non-profit basis.  It didn't work out for other reasons, but I still wonder on occasion if the model of writing grants for supporting a non-profit organization geared towards new treatments of diseases that primarily affect the world's poor is viable. 

I know that the pharma companies haven't ignored new antibiotics, it's just a really hard area (I think it was Eli Lilly that dropped several hundred million dollars into an effort and came up empty handed.)

 Would the funding structure be aimed at existing for-profit and academic institutions or is there a way that overhead costs could be covered by this funding?

<TEXT>  Do you really believe they were ESSENTIAL for his success?

Absolutely, I'm sure he'd say the same thing.  

That doesn't diminish he hard work or his investment.  Without a market for Telsa's cars, he fails, and without the California Zero-emission tax credits, Tesla isn't even profitable.  There are stories told of how close Tesla was to going under, I believe a couple of months from not being able to make payroll (read bankrupt.)  

Building PayPal is significantly easier than a car company, and the sale price of any internet-based company should be weighted carefully (How much did What's App sell for again?  Does anyone seriously think a mobile phone app was harder to develop that a car company? Luck  and a good idea is a huge part of the internet success, in fact luck is substantially under appreciated in business success.)

Here's a story for you to read: [Tesla Is No Success Story
Tesla is only profitable thanks to politics and tax subsidies.](http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/economic-intelligence/2013/06/03/teslas-success-is-the-result-of-political-favoritism)

Some quotes:

Tesla Motors, the California-based electric car start-up, has been the subject of a great deal of hype. With the recent news that it repaid its $465 million low-interest loan from the Department of Energy, it's now being heralded as a success story worthy of redeeming the failures of a green-energy subsidy program that has included the likes of Solyndra, Abound, Ener1, and Fisker Automotive. Since then, Tesla's stock value has more than doubled and the company is currently valued at around $12 billion.

and 

Even with the support of federal and state politicians, Tesla would still be reporting losses were it not for its ability to profit off of other auto manufacturers in California. In the first quarter of 2013, Tesla reported its first-ever quarterly profit by using special credits from California's Air Resources Board, which rewards auto manufacturers for the production of "zero-emission" vehicles. So far this year, Tesla was able to turn what would have been a $57 million loss into an $11 million gain by selling $68 million worth of these credits to other auto manufacturers in California.


Without a low-interest loan from the DOE, Tesla would have had some trouble getting started.  Sure he could have gone to venture capital, but they would have wanted a lot of control over the company, something Musk has been reported as being unwilling to give. </TEXT>

It is unlikely he would have made it without the government, so this is probably a case of a perfect counter example to the libertarian dream. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's important to realize that, again, INCI names aren't chemical names, so several different materials can have the same name.

For example, acrylates copolymer can be any from a list of acrylate monomers and literally any molecular weight above 1500 or so. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  put $1k towards a decent mortgage

Anyone who is making that much doesn't has a mortgage payment much higher that $1000, $2000 to $3000 for the mortgage is a lot more realistic. If you don't have a mortgage payment, you probably pay cash for an M4 anyway.  

That being said, you general analysis is correct, someone could in principle afford this, but it would be pretty dumb.  I believe most people who drive M cars lease them. (Assuming the majority of those with M cars aren't hobby racers.)  I suspect a majority of the people who drive them are business guys who want the appearance/status symbol. (that doesn't cheapen the car, just a society thing.)

<TEXT> Because INCI names aren't chemical names, they are a nomenclature of their own. 

In this context "Alcohol" strictly means ethanol [as defined in the INCI database](http://www.cosmeticobs.com/pro/news/ingredient-of-the-month/alcohol-inci-alcohol-or-alcohol-denat-803) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mercury is only used in one vaccination that children get, the DTaP, and the form used is not toxic to humans at anywhere near the concentrations used.

You could drink elemental mercury and it would pass right through you, the salts are substantially more dangerous because they are far more readily absorbed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are correct, they are both organomercury compounds, but different types.  Similar to ethanol and methanol, which are both alcohols, however they have drastically different toxicities.  A lot of ethanol os a drunken good time, 15 mL of methanol will kill you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's important not to propagate misinformation however.  Also, the mercury used at a preservative in vaccines is a different compound of mercury, and isn't nearly as dangerous to humans.  

The mercury found in tuna, however, is more than a vaccination ever was and **is** the dangerous kind, methylmercury.  It's presence is largely the result of humans burning coal which releases mercury into the environment. </TEXT>

Link to the video on youtube:

This is before a webinar I am giving covering science discussions on reddit:

http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/events/upcoming-acs-webinars/digital-media.html

(I'll post a link to the webinar on the day of so that people can easily find it.)

Hopefully reddittors find this interesting and informative as to our motivations and values. (spoiler:  we're pro-science!)

<TEXT> Thanks.  In /r/science, we have an unusual situation in that we have an incredible number of mods, 814 last count, which gives us a lot of internal review of mod actions without the drama of having a public mod log or anything like that.  Because /r/science is one of the most moderated subreddits we get a people who post thinking it's any old sub that they can make their shitty, off-topic, political comments in and get away with it.  They can't (and should not be able to, frankly.)

While we do have mods from many different back grounds, I assure you that we don't have a dramatic ideological bend beyond being pro-science, as in peer-reviewed science.  We aren't pushing any philosophical positions, mostly we try to keep them out.  That's why his comment was removed, he's making a glib comment that is pushing a personal position (which is seen in his previous comments.) </TEXT>

I created anthro as a separate sections because it tends to be more field work/lab work oriented than other fields in the social sciences, in particular Physical Anthro, which looks a lot like paleontology to the untrained observer.  Cultural Anthro and linguistics, sure, they could slot right into soc without issue.  

And honestly, from my experiences, aren't all anthropology people just functional alcoholics?  Would they even notice? :-D </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is that closer to rheology or tribiology? 

(Like I said, I'm not the one who knows about this stuff, and it's the difference of slightly different orange backgrounds on flair, anthro used to be in soc, so there are probably anthro people with soc css classes.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Our resident anthropologists tell us that Linguistics is a subset of Anthro.

http://www.aaanet.org/about/WhatisAnthropology.cfm

Social Anthro, Physical Anthro, Archaeology and Linguistics.

None of these are subsets of chemistry, so I don't have a knowledgeable opinion.

<TEXT> Yup.  There isn't really an easy way to further break down the fields since people put their particular area, not a subfield in the text.  It would have to be done manually by someone familiar with the fields separating each out.  Some of them would be pretty hard to classify as well!  

For example, we have people with engineering degrees who work on computer programs to analyze biology.  So which field are they in? </TEXT>

<TITLE> New Science Feature: Science Discussions! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-10 17:11:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Today we announce a new feature in /r/science, **Science Discussions**.  These are text posts made by verified users about issues relevant to the scientific community.  

The basic idea is that our practicing scientists will post a text post describing an issue or topic to open a discussion with /r/science.  Users may then post comments to enter the conversation, either to add information or ask a question to better understand the issue, which may be new to them.  Knowledgeable users may chime in to add more depth of information, or a different point of view.  

This is, however, not a place for political grandstanding or flame wars, so the discussion will be moderated, **be on your best behavior**.  If you can't disagree without being disagreeable, it's best to not comment at all.

That being said, we hope you enjoy quality discussions lead by experience scientists about science-related issues of the day.

Thanks for reading /r/science, and happy redditing!

<TITLE> Do you have a college degree or higher in science? Get flair indicating your expertise in /r/science! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-02 03:39:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> ##**Science Verified User Program**

/r/science has a a system of verifying accounts for commenting, enabling trained scientists, doctors and engineers to make credible comments in /r/science . The intent of this program is to enable the general public to distinguish between an educated opinion and a random comment without a background related to the topic. 


#**What flair is available?**

All of the standard science disciplines would be represented, matching those in the sidebar.
However, to better inform the public, the level of education is displayed in the flair too. For example, a Professor of biology is tagged as such (Professor- Biology), while a graduate student of biology is tagged as "Grad Student-Biology." Nurses would be tagged differently than doctors, etc...

We give flair for engineering, social sciences, natural sciences and even on occasion music.  It's your flair, if you finished a degree in something and you can offer some proof, we'll consider it.

The general format is:

Level of education|Field|Speciality or Subfield (optional)

When applying for a flair, please inform us on what you want it to say.

#**How does one obtain flair?**


First, have a college degree or higher in a field that has flair available.
Then send proof to the mods of /r/science .

This can be provided several ways:

1) [Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fscience) with information that establishes your claim, this can be a photo of your diploma or course registration, a business card, a verifiable email address, or some other identification. All submissions will be kept in confidence and not released to the public under any circumstances. You can submit an imgur link and then delete it after verification. 

Remember, that within the proof, you must tie your account name to the information in the picture.


2) if you aren't comfortable messaging the mods with identifying information, you can directly message any individual mod and supply the information to them. Again, your information will be held in confidence.


3) Send an email with your information to sciencereddit@gmail.com after messaging the mods to inform them of this option. Your email will then be deleted after verification, leaving no record. 

This is convenient if you want to take a photo of your identification and email from a smart phone, for example.


Thanks for making /r/science a better place!

<TITLE> Google Analytics tracking for reddit pages </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-07 19:53:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First off, I don't think this can be done, but I'd very much like to be wrong.

We in /r/science would like to track the number of readers who look at our AMAs, we get a lot of requests for the information and right now I have to email the admins and wait for them to get back to me with a number, I can't look at changes over time, or any other handy stats to let us know how people are using our AMAs. 

If we could embed a smart pixel via CSS we could gather some data on this, but it appears that all of the images that the subreddit CSS pulls need to be hosted on a reddit server, which would make our tracking pixel just a pixel.

Any thoughts on how to do this or am I stuck continually harassing people to get data?

<TITLE> Do you have a college degree or higher in science? Get flair indicating your expertise in /r/science! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-11 04:47:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> ##**Science Verified User Program**

/r/science has a a system of verifying accounts for commenting, enabling trained scientists, doctors and engineers to make credible comments in /r/science . The intent of this program is to enable the general public to distinguish between an educated opinion and a random comment without a background related to the topic. 


#**What flair is available?**

All of the standard science disciplines would be represented, matching those in the sidebar.
However, to better inform the public, the level of education is displayed in the flair too. For example, a Professor of biology is tagged as such (Professor- Biology), while a graduate student of biology is tagged as "Grad Student-Biology." Nurses would be tagged differently than doctors, etc...

The general format is:

Level of education|Field|Speciality or Subfield (optional)

When applying for a flair, please inform us on what you want it to say.

#**How does one obtain flair?**


First, have a college degree or higher in a field that has flair available.
Then send proof to the mods of /r/science .

This can be provided several ways:

1) [Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fscience) with information that establishes your claim, this can be a photo of your diploma or course registration, a business card, a verifiable email address, or some other identification. All submissions will be kept in confidence and not released to the public under any circumstances. You can submit an imgur link and then delete it after verification. 

Remember, that within the proof, you must tie your account name to the information in the picture.


2) if you aren't comfortable messaging the mods with identifying information, you can directly message any individual mod and supply the information to them. Again, your information will be held in confidence.


3) Send an email with your information to sciencereddit@gmail.com after messaging the mods to inform them of this option. Your email will then be deleted after verification, leaving no record. 

This is convenient if you want to take a photo of your identification and email from a smart phone, for example.


Thanks for making /r/science a better place!

<TITLE> Science AMA Series: Ask Your Questions About Ebola. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-01 03:03:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ebola has been in the news a lot lately, but the recent news of a case of it in Dallas has alarmed many people.  

The short version is:  Everything will be fine, healthcare systems in the USA are more than capable of dealing with Ebola, there is no threat to the public.

That being said, after discussions with the verified users of /r/science, we would like to open up to questions about Ebola and infectious diseases.

**Please consider donations to [Doctors Without Borders](http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/our-work/medical-issues/ebola?utm_source=google utm_medium=ppc utm_term=brand_sitelink) to help fight Ebola, it is a serious humanitarian crisis that is drastically underfunded.** (Yes, I donated.)

Here is the ebola fact sheet from the World Health Organization: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/

Post your questions for knowledgeable medical doctors and biologists to answer.

**[If you have expertise in the area, please verify your credentials with the mods and get appropriate flair before answering questions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/flair)**

Also, you may read the [Science AMA from Dr. Stephen Morse on the Epidemiology of Ebola](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/2cbthq/science_ama_series_im_stephen_morse_a_professor/)  

as well as the numerous questions submitted to /r/AskScience on the subject:

[Epidemiologists of Reddit, with the spread of the ebola virus past quarantine borders in Africa, how worried should we be about a potential pandemic?](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2c4x07/epidemiologists_of_reddit_with_the_spread_of_the/)

[Why are (nearly) all ebola outbreaks in African countries?](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/220ac8/why_are_nearly_all_ebola_outbreaks_in_african/)

[Why is Ebola not as contagious as, say, influenza if it is present in saliva, therefore coughs and sneezes ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2d3p7d/why_is_ebola_not_as_contagious_as_say_influenza/)

[Why is Ebola so lethal? Does it have the potential to wipe out a significant population of the planet?](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2bs08v/why_is_ebola_so_lethal_does_it_have_the_potential/)

[How long can Ebola live outside of a host?](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2cbvtl/how_long_can_ebola_live_outside_of_a_host/)

Also, from /r/IAmA: [I work for Doctors Without Borders - ask me anything about Ebola.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2g79ip/i_work_for_doctors_without_borders_ask_me/)

[CDC and health departments are asserting "Ebola patients are infectious when symptomatic, not before"-- what data, evidence, science from virology, epidemiology or clinical or animal studies supports this assertion? How do we know this to be true?](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2i51u1/cdc_and_health_departments_are_asserting_ebola/)

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi, I'm Marcel Salathe, assistant professor on leave to work on startup. Short CV: Graduated at ETH Zurich, Switzerland, moved to US for postdoc at Stanford, took tenure-track faculty position at Penn State a few years ago, became very active in nascent field of digital epidemiology, created a popular MOOC on infectious diseases (on coursera), came back to the Bay Area earlier this year because I was accepted into Y Combinator, now working on a new project, Teeays.
Happy to talk about all these things, particularly with respect to online education, academic life vs startup life, but happy to answer other questions too.

Post your questions here:

<TEXT> We're looking for a practical way to judge Panelist activity in /r/AskScience, and a good way would be to generate a log like the moderation log but tracking flaired users.  We don't care so much what they've posted, but rather how much Panelists post, so a simple tabulation of the poster and the number of comments would be fine.

Seems like it would be straight forward, but I've learned that simple things sometimes aren't so simple, so it makes sense to ask more experienced people first! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Do you have a college degree or higher in science? Get flair indicating your expertise in /r/science! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-09 03:40:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> ##**Science Verified User Program**

/r/science has a a system of verifying accounts for commenting, enabling trained scientists, doctors and engineers to make credible comments in /r/science . The intent of this program is to enable the general public to distinguish between an educated opinion and a random comment without a background related to the topic. 


#**What flair is available?**

All of the standard science disciplines would be represented, matching those in the sidebar.
However, to better inform the public, the level of education is displayed in the flair too. For example, a Professor of biology is tagged as such (Professor- Biology), while a graduate student of biology is tagged as "Grad Student-Biology." Nurses would be tagged differently than doctors, etc...

The general format is:

Level of education|Field|Speciality or Subfield (optional)

When applying for a flair, please inform us on what you want it to say.

#**How does one obtain flair?**


First, have a college degree or higher in a field that has flair available.
Then send proof to the mods of /r/science .

This can be provided several ways:

1) Message the mods with information that establishes your claim, this can be a photo of your diploma or course registration, a business card, a verifiable email address, or some other identification. All submissions will be kept in confidence and not released to the public under any circumstances. You can submit an imgur link and then delete it after verification. 

Remember, that within the proof, you must tie your account name to the information in the picture.


2) if you aren't comfortable messaging the mods with identifying information, you can directly message any individual mod and supply the information to them. Again, your information will be held in confidence.


3) Send an email with your information to sciencereddit@gmail.com after messaging the mods to inform them of this option. Your email will then be deleted after verification, leaving no record. 

This is convenient if you want to take a photo of your identification and email from a smart phone, for example.

Edit:  Hi.  We're getting flooded with requests, we're adding people as fast as we can, if we miss you somehow, we apologize, if you don't see your flair or get a response in the next two days, message us again.

Thanks for making /r/science a better place!

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In AskScience and Science we have a lot of flaired users, and we'd like to be able to add them to a private subreddit, right now it's done entirely by hand, which is a real chore if several people have added flair.  

Is there an existing script or bot that would automate the process, like the script that syncs flair between two subreddits?  I'm not a programmer, but it seems like something that should be straight forward to do with PRAW. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Environmental biology professor at [Fort Lewis College Durango, CO, USA]( http://www.fortlewis.edu), [studying the biological impacts of climate change](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QcIjyzwAAAAJ hl=en).  She studied the biological consequences of earlier snowmelt, climate warming, and most recently elevated CO2.  Her research on how elevated CO2, not just climate warming, leads to a longer growing season was [published in the journal Nature](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature13207.html), and reported in the [news](http://www.nature.com/news/co2-makes-growing-seasons-longer-1.15081), including in a [New York Times column on changing seasons and its consequences](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/science/springing-forward-and-its-consequences.html).  Studies like hers highlight the need to better understand the impacts of environmental changes that happen at the same time.  Her study shows an apparent benefit of greater CO2 concentrations on growing season length that we did not expect based on [an earlier conceptual model on changing seasons] (https://www.sciencemag.org/content/324/5929/886.summary).  Earths biological systems are changing due to human choices, and we need to better understand the impacts, both positive and negative, to reduce the associated risks.

<TEXT> **Science AMA Series: We helped create the Third National Climate Assessment Report. Ask us anything!**

This past Tuesday, May 6, the White House released the Third U.S. National Climate Assessment - the most comprehensive national effort to assess the science and effects of climate change in the U.S. The report is designed to help officials, businesses, and members of the public in all regions and sectors of the country make the best decisions when dealing with climate change and managing related risk. The NCA also illustrates how these regions and sectors are connected. Unlike previous assessments, this NCA has been released as an interactive website, nca2014.globalchange.gov, to make it more accessible and useful to both citizens and scientists.

We are researchers at the University of Arizona who played a significant role in both the overall report leadership and especially the Southwest and Forestry chapters. We will be answering questions starting at 2PM EST. 

Who is here:
Kathy Jacobs - Recently returned to the University of Arizona to lead the UAs Center for Climate Adaptation Science and Solutions after serving as the Director of the National Climate Assessment for the White House.

Gregg Garfin - Lead author of the Southwest chapter of the NCA and Professor in the UAs School of Natural Resources and the Environment


Dave Breshears - Lead author on the Forests chapter of the NCA, drawing on his expertise on drought-related tree die-off, and Professor in the UAs School of Natural Resources and the Environment


Dan Ferguson - Director of the Climate Assessment for the Southwest 


Thomas McDonald - Project and Events Coordinator at the University of Arizonas Institute of the Environment, helping us navigate Reddit and input our answers.


tl;dr - The White House released the third National Climate Assessment(NCA) on Tuesday. It is comprehensive, designed to help everyone make decisions to deal with climate change, and released as an interactive website, a first for the Feds. The just-returned-from-the-White-House former director of the NCA, Kathy Jacobs, and a number of contributors, all from the University of Arizona, will be here starting at 2PM EST, 5/9/14 to answer your questions.

This gave me a good fright until I figured it out, for some reason, and this is something that not many would notice, in subs with many user flairs, if you have RES enabled the "Next" button to see the next page of user flair is gone.  This gives the impression that the user flair has been deleted, but it's still there.  

If you disable RES and reload the "Next" button appears and you can go through the list.
