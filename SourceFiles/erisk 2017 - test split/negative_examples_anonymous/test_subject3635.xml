<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I often play online chess with a friend of mine who recently started playing. We play these long correspondence games where one gets ample time to move a piece. 

I don't know how but suddenly after 2 weeks the guy has improved tremendously. We are in the middle of a game right now and I'm probably going to lose my light squared bishop and it's just going to be very hard to recover from this.

Chess is the only thing I was good at. I've been playing for years and got a 1700-ish rating on some online websites and even won some online tournaments.

Man it's gonna hurt if I lose </TEXT>

<TITLE> 23/M Looking for an accountability buddy for waking up early </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-12 11:10:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's simple really. I think if you wake up early you get extra hours in your day and can perform better. I have had accountability buddies in the past and it went out quite well for a few months. 
I try to wake up at 5 am everyday which requires sleeping on time too. 
If you aim at waking up at 6 or 7 am, it's fine by me. I know 5 am is a bit freakish. 

How the accountability shall work -

The moment we wake up we take a photo of our wrist watch along with a piece of paper on which we write "I am awake" 
Why?
Coz it generally means you're out of the bed now. 

If interested let me know. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's been a year since I broke up with my ex-gf. I have a tattoo of her name on my body which I intend to remove as soon as I get my finances right. It was a bad decision to get it in the first place, but...eh...mistakes happen. 

I have suffered a lot in the past few months. But having no contact with my ex has helped me a lot in moving on. It would have been even better had she not messaged me at all. She used to message me like once a week or something and I could see the display pic of her hugging her new boyfriend. She moved on very quickly after we broke up. That fact tormented me a lot.

Anyway, I'm in a better mental state now and it's been a life changing experience. I just want to say that if you're suffering right now then, just know that it will end one day and you will be able to breathe. 

There will come a day when you won't wake up in the morning with the thought of your ex in your head and the memories will begin to fade away. Just hang in there. Also if you focus on reading and some outdoor activities, it'll just help more. 

Both good times and bad times end one day.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. Astronomy - I recently joined the amature astronomers club in my city and it's been an amazing experience to say the least. I am still a newbie so I hardly know much but I think my passion is only going to grow.

1. Reading - before my last break-up I used to read a lot, but my ex-gf used to devour most of my time and then by the last few months of the relationship she turned into one  of those "crying" manipulative women. Rediscovering my love for reading has been one of the best thing I have ever done. I recently finished Brave New World and right now I'm reading Crime and Punishment by Dostoyevsky.

3. Cricket - I love Cricket. The Ashes will begin soon and I can't wait. 

4. Gaming - I like playing Civilization 5 whenever I find time. It's the best game I ever played.

5. Learning to play the Harmonica. I bought a diatonic harmonica a month ago and I spend around 30 minutes everyday practicing it. It'll take a lot of time before I learn to play my favourite songs, but the investment will be worth it. </TEXT>

If it is executed properly then it could be one of the best things that ever happened to Delhi.

Moreover the play grounds of Government  schools will be available to colony kids for playing after school hours so that'll be cool too. It's a small move, but was really needed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, Sobha Singh was a real British boot-licker. People used to call him 'adhi Delhi ka malik'

Khushwant Singh wrote about it in one of his 'Malice towards one and all' articles in HT.

I miss those articles though. Nostalgia :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> U.S - Pakistan is purely a employer-employee relationship. U.S throws the money and Pakistan salutes. 

Whereas with a country like India the equation is totally different. I firmly believe that the U.S India strategic partnership will be one of the defining partnerships of 21st century  </TEXT>

We have been living in a socialist system for decades now and it didn't work. Accept that. </TEXT>
