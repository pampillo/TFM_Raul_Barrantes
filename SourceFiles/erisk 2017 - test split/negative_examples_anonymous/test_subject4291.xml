<TEXT> I'm definitely planning to rescue an adult (don't feel like dealing with having to look after a hyper/destructive puppy).
So hypothetically, if I could run with my Husky for 2 hours after work, would that be sufficient? I don't think I can leave it alone for 10 hours... 

As for dog walkers, what would be the best way to go about that? Have the walker take the Husky for a walk or two every day while I'm at work? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I really want a Husky, but I'll be working full-time soon, meaning I'd be out of the house close to 10 hours per day. It's also not a big house, and has no fenced-in yard.

What can I do to make getting a Husky possible? Would taking it to a doggy day-care every weekday be okay for the dog? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm about to start working full time in a suburban area in Washington state; I'll be living alone and out of the apartment for 9-10 hours every weekday. I want a dog for companionship though, and am willing to do the needed grooming and exercising (1-1.5 hours per day), though I don't think I'll have a fenced-in yard.

I really want a Husky. I'd likely get an adult rescue (not a puppy); would it be too demanding?

Otherwise, other breeds I'd be interested in are Mastiffs, Australian Shepards or Shiba Inus. Would any of those suit my lifestyle better?


Edit: If I were to get a dog walker to walk the dog around midday (so the dog would never be alone for more than 4 hours or so), would a Husky be out of the question? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was lost while trying to get to a late evening meeting in Melbourne (I was an exchange student). My phone's GPS didn't work abroad, and I didn't have the sense to print a map before leaving. I had no idea where I was or which direction to go in, so I ask a random person on the street for directions. He says I'm about five miles from where I need to be, and there aren't tram that could take me there. He offers me a ride, which despite being super weird, I accept. I would have been late otherwise. 

In his car we got a bit conversation going. I asked him what he does. He was the [mayor of Yarra City](http://www.yarracity.vic.gov.au/Your-Council/Councillors/cr-geoff-barbour-mayor/). I was dumbfounded. Awesome guy. He was up for re-election, so I made sure to tell my Aussie pals about this encounter (some of whom called bullshit).

tldr; lost in Melbourne City, got ride from random stranger who turned out to be the mayor. </TEXT>

That said, the issue of politicians blindly voting along party lines is still one that needs to be addressed, as well as the issue of politicians not understanding what they're voting for (my favorite example is [this](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/08/florida-banned-computers_n_3561701.html)). </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This way, uninformed politicians would be kept out of blindly voting along party lines. As an added bonus, you'd be able to see which politicians are roadkill (i.e. not reading anything, thereby not voting on anything).

The quiz would likely need to be created by professional lawpersons, and would need to be kept in strict secrecy for this to work.

<TEXT> This had bugged me for some time, being a Belgian studying in America. I grew up speaking Dutch and French, so whenever an American pronounces a typical Dutch/French word incorrectly, it gets under my skin. 
One recent example is my professors pronunciation of 'apartheid'. In Afrikaans or Dutch it should be pronounced something like 'apart hide', but my profs use the American 'th' pronunciation in the word.

Am I in the wrong here? If no, what are foreign words that get mispronounced that really bug you? </TEXT>
