<TITLE> with Puss in Boots 2 in 2018, I think Dreamworks should do spin-off/prequels involving Shrek and Donkey </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-22 13:21:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> What I mean is a prequel focusing on Shrek's life before Shrek 1 and a prequel on Donkey's life before Shrek 1 etc. If Puss in Boots was successful, then these could do just as well in my opinion. I especially would pay to see a Donkey movie!  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 1. I thought the soundtrack was cool but very misused. WHY they played it during the silent driving scenes where there's no tension or fear building up i will never know.
2. The main girl was such a dumb character. On the beach, she should have been constantly looking around for "it" rather than just look out to sea, then she gets hit by it. So dumb!
3. There was no tension.
4. It wasnt scary. 
5. The ending was dogshit. 

anyway, thats just my opinion. (let the hate begin) </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-07-05 17:18:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'd actually wouldn't mind a sequel to Origins. I think since there's 5 years between Origins and Asylum there's plenty of backstories and origins to explore in a Origins 2. Which ones would you like to see?

I'd love to see Dick Grayson become Robin and have him (possibly) as a recurring playable side character and allow dual play to return from Knight but it would be a main gameplay feature. I think that would be potentially awesome! 

What would you want to see? (no hate please - keep it friendly)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everyone always asks who should play Bond next (I think Henry Cavill) but not too many people ask who the next villain should be. So that's what I'm asking.

I'm thinking Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor (he was rumored for Bond 24) and Idris Elba would be good ones. (Yes i would prefer Elba as a villain rather than Bond himself).

<TITLE> Rockstar need to add the ability to sell Pegasus vehicles in a future update. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I bought a Savage and although I love the guns and firepower, it's very defenseless and it leaves me vulnerable flying around in free mode. This got me thinking that R* need to put on the ability to sell Pegasus vehicles, so if you buy the Savage and are dissatisfied you can just sell it. 

not sure what question i wanna ask but comment your thoughts/ideas/suggestions on this topic.   </TEXT>
