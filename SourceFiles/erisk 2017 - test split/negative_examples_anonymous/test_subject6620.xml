[Here's my favorite from the playoffs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8FKbhcILWc index=15 list=PL5Ieao-D3SgZ7pDJ_iIqdYqaQK0P5rFnu) 

Couldn't find one of my favorite Sharp plays though. You guys remember when he stole the puck against the Sharks and sent a home-run pass up the ice for someone to score a breakaway? ...it was like 3 years ago.

Anyway, [here's a fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8FKbhcILWc index=15 list=PL5Ieao-D3SgZ7pDJ_iIqdYqaQK0P5rFnu) against the Blues for good measure. 

I'm going to miss saying "That's a 2 min penalty for being too handsome" so hopefully he heads the the penalty box a few times when we see him next year in green.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alright. Confession time here. Chris Farley died when I was in 4th grade. I told my 5 y/o brother that he got too fat for the earth to support him anymore and he caused the elevator in the John Hancock Center to fall so fast that it burst through the earth's crust, subsequently causing him to be perpetually falling until one day in the future he will break through the Earth again and re-emerge in China.

He believed this for YEARS, and would constantly ask me if he was still falling or if there was a hole in the floor of the Hancock Center that you could "see through the world." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let's give the man a chance before we decide he isn't a good fit for this team. I, myself am very excited to see him play on the 4th line. I watched him quite a bit when he was in town with the Wolves. He is speedy, has good hands, and is Shawzian in his ability to get under people's skin. 

Many of you were flipping out at the thought of Desjardins replacing Ben Smith, and we all seem to be fine with that now. Garbutt possesses more offensive upside than Desi or Smith. 

I predict we'll get about 12-14 goals out of him this season, and while he'll make trips to the penalty box, he and Shaw will be earning us a number of power plays.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good wishes to your family, sir or madam. While in a different point in my Mazda 3 journey, you've inspired me to write my own ode: (excuse the (no, not Nissan) stanzas for not existing)

Aspirations of high school coolness were put to the test

When I was handed the keys to a Cavalier RS

17 years of Chicago winters have must 

Caused the doors to be completely consumed by rust.

Things looked up in college you see, 

As I saved up enough for a Grand Am GT

With a badge of Ram Air and faux dual-exhaust

I destroyed the power-steering for an $800 cost

Surviving thieves, snow, winds, and ad-vers-ity

The coupe failed safety tests in the state of Vir-Ginny.

Feeling dejected, down, and just out of luck

It was sold in the shithole of Maryland for $4000 bucks!

I used public transit for 2 months or less 

Until I bought a punchless Elantra GLS.

Indeed alloy wheels and privacy glass it had,

But when obliterated by a RX350 I wasnt overwhelmingly sad.

But I enter the Mazda 3, and grabbed the wheel,

I became enthused by its unique steering feel. 

Despite its blue-eyed goofy grin, these 6-speed Mazda 3s 

Are in a class of their own with those MPGs.

<TEXT> So many memories of this guy.

I remember watching him dominate the Wolves in the 2005 Calder Cup finals next to a young Mike Richards   Jeff Carter, and a reprehensible parasite named Jon Sim. 

Then, I remember seeing a short blurb in the back of the Sun Times' sports section saying that the Hawks traded Matt Ellison for Patrick Sharp. Exciting news for a Hawks fan who was chomping at the bit to see the next wave of "stars" like Tony Salmelainen and Pavel Vorobiev. 

Then, many years later in 2011 or 2012, my future wife and I were walking through her neighborhood of North Center, and spotted a very nice yet old fashioned couch in an alley behind a monstrosity of a new home. We decided to take the couch back to her place. I learned shortly later that Sharp had just moved into that house. Soon, the "alley couch" became the "Patrick Sharp couch." 

The rest is a blur right now with the exception of this beauty against the Preds.

Then I went to a public high school were the following apparel/colors were banned: 
Baby Blue and Black, Yellow and Black, the color Pink, NY Yankees gear, Georgetown University gear, the number 22, and any random Mexican kids that security wanted to stop in the hallways. 

The punishment was going to the Dean's office and changing into these giant Pepsi t-shirts. I'm constantly baffled as to why neither school just made us get uniforms. </TEXT>

[Legendary moment with Sullivan:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qye101BNhWE) 
People seem to forget that he scored two short-handed goals after getting hit with the puck. 

Also, I remember him having an epic game on St. Patty's day one night. His trade to Nashville was so infuriating; scores a hat-trick in his first game as a Pred and puts up 10 pts in 3 games.

Recently, I ran into the Edgewater Jewel early one morning and had a guy remark to me how cold it was.

<TEXT> Do we really need to keep referring to Carcillo as an "enforcer?" Yes, Rosenbloom calls him an "agitator" in the article, and that is what Carcillo is. Yet I've seen a dozen articles since last weekend stating that the Hawks have brought back their "enforcer."

Is Carcillo really going to police play on the ice? If a John Scott-type boards one of our guys, what is he going to do about it other than make a bunch of noise and take an undisciplined penalty? 

From what I remember Carcillo's fights were usually retaliatory when he was here.

<TITLE> A couple of educators looking to increase career potential. Does going back to school make sense? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-30 03:58:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello, career gurus.

I'll try to make this as to-the-point as possible, but I apologize in advance if this turns into the Unabomber Manifesto.

My wife (age 27) and I (age 26) both work for the same company, but at different sites. We are reading specialists who work in the clinical setting; that's about as descriptive as I'm getting about the private company we work for. We both have had previous management roles in the company, but upon relocating to Chicago (my hometown/where my wife has decided that she wants to stay forever) we have limited opportunities for growth within our company, and have since taken pay cuts.

I have a teaching degree, but my only endorsement is in Social Studies; it has been way less fruitful trying to land a classroom position here in Chicago than my search in DC. (I got one on my first interview there).
My wife does not have a teaching certificate, but is going to get her Masters' in Special Ed and her IL License. She'll get a job in 2 years, not doubting that. I'm considering doing a 9 month program to get my endorsement to teach Special Ed as well. (We both have a number of years working with this population in the clinical setting).

Here's how the proposed Grad School costs break down:
Wife's Masters' Degree: $35k
My Endorsement: Probably $12k

I feel like my wife is a bit of a spontaneous person and not a planner like myself. I can't really see these costs making life too much easier at the moment. Especially if we are multiplying our debts 4 or 5 times.
I hate to say this to her, but I'm starting to think that when we move out of our nice $1300/mo apartment on the Northside this December that we won't be able to live in a place this nice for the next decade. (We won't be getting rich as teachers, but the expected salary would probably be about $48k with increases; that's about 15-20% more than what we make now)

With this outlook, should I focus on how going back to school may maximize our earning potential, and provide more for our future (a pension plus a 403b plan, rather than the 401k that our employer matches 10%) or is will this make us highly-qualified, yet broke educators?

Any thoughts appreciated.

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello! I wanted to gain some perspective on the value of an LBS1 endorsement as a job candidate. I have an IL Type 09 certificate with a grade 6-12 designation and a focus in social studies. (...yes, only social studies...)

Would doing a 9 month endorsement program for LBS1 increase my chances of getting a classroom job next fall? Or, is a position as a Special Ed teacher really dependent on Special Ed licensure?

I have 3 years experience with students with special needs in the clinical setting.

Thanks in advance, and keep up the amazing work and dedication!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My wife would probably get a job in a few weeks after graduating. She's great at networking and communicating with professionals. In fact, there is a few schools that have already inquired about hiring her in the short amount of time she has decided to leave the company, but she's been inhibited by the fact that she doesn't have a teaching license. 

I'd have to work harder for sure, but my track record is good and getting an endorsement in Special Ed should help my chances. It's just that the Chicago area teaching job market is completely flooded with people like me, so the endorsement would hopefully set me apart. Part of me wants to explore the job market in other places (like her home state of Florida) where prospects seem better.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's really hard for me to hate Fleury; in fact, it was really hard to get excited about the Hawks in the early 2000s. Like the writer of the blog, I was watching the Wolves win Turner Cups and Calder Cups during this era, and learning that Fleury was coming to the Hawks was exciting. True, he didn't perform; he was out of shape and on a bad team, not to mention that he was suicidal during his stay in Chicago. When the team is only good enough to win 30 games in a season, guys like Fleury, Sullivan, and heck even Kyle Calder provided rare bright spots in a dreary season.

Funny enough, I actually found an autographed copy of his book "Playing with Fire" in a used bookstore last night. The chapter on Chicago gives a great perspective on his performance here. I was laughing in the bookstore after reading Brian Sutter's quote. "Theo, you're in fucking horrible shape."   </TEXT>

<TEXT> First of all your idea of DC people being uptight workaholics is true. Now add politically charged to that. Thank God I'm back in Chicago where people distrust politicians enough to not wear their political views on their sleeves. 

As you probably know, DC is EXPENSIVE! Here you will never pay $4.35 for a damn train ride one way within the city. I'm not sure what neighborhood you live in, but the wife and I made more than $90k per year in DC and we had a mediocre 1BR apartment on the west end of Alexandria, VA for $1300/mo... and literally DIRT for a front lawn. Here, you will get a lot more for your money if you're a renter. No it isn't cheap (sales tax..ahhhh), but by DC standards it would be a breath of fresh air. 

Now here are my biased opinions:
 
-Chicago Art Institute  National Gallery of Art/ *any* Smithsonian Museum

-Museum of Science and Industry  Smithsonian Space whatever-the-hell-it's-called museum 

-Chicago lake front  National Mall

-Chicago hot dog  DC-3 (which has some damn good hot dogs)

-Deep dish pizza  $60 sushi roll or whatever people go out and eat in DC

-Mariano's   Jewel-Osco  Giant or Harris Teeter

-Chicago's grid system of roads  Than the 6 miles of traffic circles on Mass Ave that will take you 1.5 hours to drive down.

-Bears   Blackhawks  Racist Redskins or creatively named "Caps"

-Chinatown = Chinatown, but Chicago also has Korea town + Argyle Street (mini- SE Asia)... Get into Vietnamese subs!

-Wicker Park  H Street 

-Have to say I haven't experienced much of the Pride celebration here in Chicago (always avoided the huge crowds), but DC Pride was pretty huge, my guess is that it stacks up. 

In summary, you'll find what you're looking for here in Chicago. Move here if you can get a solid job lined up! </TEXT>

At least my observation is that a majority of the *dirty hits* that we've come to know (mainly the ones involving a guy on a stretcher) are coming in a post 2005 NHL. 

Not to say that the 80s game wasn't full of dirty plays, just on a different level.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wouldn't say "spot on". It's more complex than that. He attributed the "white flight" of the 1940s to white people of the Southside feeling disenchanted with living next to black people for the simple reason that they didn't like black people. 

However, this perspective doesn't take into account that a lot of white people left the city in 1968. Things were so incredibly screwed-up that Chicago wasn't safe for many white people or black people. Mayor Daley was ordering the police to shoot rioters on site. White police treated blacks brutally. Some blacks treated whites brutally; there were people attacked on the streets because their skin was a certain color. Whites and blacks were both the victims or racism. This was the year most of my family members moved out of the city, including my grandfather who was told not to show up to work without a gun during the riots. He worked in a factory. 

These charged-up feelings have persisted for years and carried over to later generations. My dad used to deliver tires on the Southside during the 80s. He was put in a lot of dangerous situations including one where bat and club-wielding guys surrounded his truck in an alley shouting "Get the fuck out of the truck white boy." So, he went to his supervisor (who was black) and told him that he had to send a black guy on that route for his own safety. 

So it's easy to say that the "white flight" was based on arbitrary dislike for black people; for some, however, the charged-up emotions that have scarred groups of people for decades are too much to live with day to day. That isn't to say that I don't empathize with those stuck in the impoverished neighborhoods.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I found myself in a similar situation recently. I actually needed to move 700 miles back home due to the declining health of my future mother in law. I was as professional and honest as I could have been, and my administrators took note. I also offered my help in finding a highly qualified replacement candidate. 

I gave them a clear picture that this decision was based on my commitment to family. It was by no means an easy decision for me and I felt sick about it for weeks, but all three administrators showed empathy and professionalism. They have been my biggest advocates for getting back into the classroom. It is hard to feel confident about a decision like this, but as long as they saw your talents and are decent human beings it should not be an inhibitor in your career. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I'm going to recommend that you look at Elmwood Park or River Grove. I take it that your schedule doesn't allow you to use public transit. These towns are outside the city of Chicago, but if it is crucial that you are able to be in Maywood in 20 mins notice then you could be in Maywood in that time window. 

I'm not sure what your definition of "ghetto" is, so I'm steering you clear of the west side and Maywood. I grew up in Melrose Park and most people in the neighborhood talked about Maywood as if it were a lawless hellhole (although it is right next door and not too different than Melrose Park)

Elmwood Park/ River Grove are neighbors to the city, and if your planning to access the city by car it won't take too long. However, if you insist on living in the city of Chicago, then look at Jefferson Park or Old Irving Park. (With traffic do not assume that Maywood would be 20 mins away at any given time... or ever really)   </TEXT>

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm going to assume that crime is out of control. I just moved back to Chicago after living in DC for a year. I stopped in Gary with my big clunky u haul, and was immediately approached by the gas station security guard. He seemed curious to know why I chose to stop there, then warned me it was a bad area. It just struck me as desolate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you really love Hemingway you'll enjoy the place. I do remember going here on a field trip though. Some girl passed out because it was 95 degrees  in there. My teacher hated Hemingway, and later apologized for the trip being a part of the curriculum. There was a guy who was about 100 giving the tour, and I think his name was Jim Christmas. He was pretty hilarious.

For what it's worth, visit the Hemingway foundation across the street. There are some cool samples of his writing from way back, including a description of a football game that he wrote in 9th Grade at OPRF. Hemingway got an F on it. </TEXT>

Yes, this could work. As long as it is structured and serves a purpose. 20 minutes per week of reading current news stories and listening to music is a way I reward students if they meet the expectation. (All assignments attempted, no behavior referrals, no excessive tardies, etc.) 

Also hype up your incentives. Once a month, I'll raffle a Chipotle/Subway gift card to a student who has no missing assignments, no behavior referrals, and less than two tardies.  </TEXT>

Talk about a guy that brought such intensity every week, going all-out is why he had so many injuries, and when he would get injured you could see how much it frustrated him to be on the sidelines.

<TEXT> 1991 Chevy [Cavalier RS](http://carphotos.cardomain.com/ride_images/1/3093/1221/7730610002_large.jpg) Owned this car in high school/freshman year of college, and actually drove it from 2005 to 2007; which is shocking, because today it is one of the most egregious vehicles that I have ever seen let alone owned. 

The car was sort-of white and featured electric blue and black trim along each bumper and exterior door panel. Giant electric blue and black letters saying "CAVALIER RS" bedecked the driver doors. The Rally Sport edition that also had painted-white metal wheels. Mine was literally falling apart. Any parking lot where I closed my door was sprinkled with rusty dust. 

Then, literally everything on the car broke. Someone slammed into the driver's door in high school, so that didn't open. The power locks broke, so I was forced to climb through the trunk should I decide to lock the doors that actually worked. No A/C. No Heat. I came out of class one day to notice that the exhaust system had literally snapped in half, and  I dragged the pipe down the street going a top speed of 30mph with my gas pedal to the floor. 

The good news? I sold it for $100 in '07.

TLDR: The 1991 Cavalier RS is an incredibly shitty automobile.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Here are a couple options through DC social sports.](http://dcsocialsports.com/leagues/soccer?state=LIVE locationId=) The co-ed league is more at the recreational level. (Although the teams I have played for had some really great females on them). The men's league is much more competitive. We play at the Long Bridge Park soccer fields, they are synthetic turf, and lighted for night games. Plus, the league usually has a bar component where everyone goes out and drinks post-game. </TEXT>

<TITLE> What is your experience with "scope and sequence?" </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-07-13 00:21:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have been offered a position to teach middle school social studies in DC. After just speaking with my principal in passing, she said that she would like to sit down with me and discuss the "scope and sequence" for the 7th   8th Grade social studies curriculum next year. From my research, I'm picturing that this is a long term, big-picture framework for district wide lesson planning. However, she mentioned that she was not satisfied with the last social studies teacher's "scope and sequence." Which makes me believe that I may have to do some collaborating with her to make the overall, big-picture framework. 

Of course, when I sit down with her I would like to appear like I know what I'm talking about. So, if those of you out there in r/historyteachers-land could give me some information on what I can expect to talk to her about I'd greatly appreciate it! I have seemed very confident in my interactions with her thusfar, but she is a bit intimidating (Columbia Teachers' College grad, and also a big history nerd). Just trying to avoid being sent to the social studies teachers' graveyard like the last guy. 

[This is the only example I was able to locate online](http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/Files/downloads/In-the-Classroom/How-Students-Are-Assessed/Grade%207%20ELA%20SAS%20SY13-14.pdf)

<TEXT> Also, that Focus is very fun to drive. I had to drive a friend of mine home once in a Focus hatch from this era, and I was very impressed with its pickup and handling. Probably had all the same features as yours, but she had hers shipped here from the Netherlands, so it gave it an extra cool factor. One of the most fun cars I've driven for sure. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not necessarily stupid though, more of a sad trade-off. The area I moved to last winter made driving my Pontiac far too laborious. I got a "smarter" car that saves me money on both fuel and VA requirements. However, it lacks the special feel of driving the Pontiac. 

I was going through a quarter tank of gas every day working in DC, and then I find out that Northern VA has a 24-point inspection for road safety. (My driver's door didn't shut properly   power windows didn't work among some other issues with the power steering) All in all, I sold it in MD for $4000 in exchange for a friendlier DC driver (the Elantra). 

In summary, we aren't making "stupid" decisions, just dealing with the reality of the increasingly Pontiac-less motoring world of today.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been in Alexandria for about six months now, but after buying a car in FL, and then switching over to VA license and registration I have paid the "vehicle property tax" and posted the sticker on my car as proof. 

Here's the thing, less than half the cars in my neighborhood have City of Alexandria stickers on them. I'm noticing that a number of the ones that do have stickers also have out-of-date ones. Is the vehicle property tax just something that isn't really enforced in AVA? And am I a sucker for even paying it?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> DC Area Teachers and Prospective Teachers? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-11-20 05:04:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Please tell me what is the job market for teachers like in the metropolitan area? 

I am moving here next month from Chicago as part of a project that my current employer is doing. However, I'm a certified teacher and haven't gotten a classroom in IL due to an insane disparity between many applicants and very few openings. (not to mention widespread district cutbacks, etc.) I'd love to teach in DC or northern VA. 

So redditor-educators of DC, what type of climate should I expect? Are there any districts that you know of that I should target? Do you know of any paraprofessional/teaching-aide positions that may be opening up in the near future? I'd love to get my foot in the door, and would be open to ditching my employer to make a positive step in obtaining my goal of teaching in the classroom. 

Any suggestions or advice would be much appreciated.

Thanks!!   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here is my situation: 24 y/o BA in Secondary Education; BA in History.

After two unsuccessful summers of not landing a full-time position as a history teacher, I am planning to do something more practical in place of the subject that I feel passionate about. The economic incentives of being a substitute teacher or a private school teacher are non-existent. I make more in my current position at a reading clinic/ my union weekend job.

From a purely practical/economic perspective, does it make sense for me to jump into a Masters of Science in Accounting program? 

It seems that the opportunities are more bountiful in this field, and if I strike out at landing a teaching job next year I'm probably going to give up anyway. Assuming that I can complete CPA certification, I probably can use a family connection to help me land a position in the accounting field. Just wanted to know if there is anything beneath the surface that would make it equally difficult for me in this field.

Thanks!

<TEXT> [This video] (http://www.empireofsoccer.com/flashback-vid-the-nasl-shootout-new-york-cosmos-v-washington-diplomats/) shows the intensity and suspense that were present in NASL shootouts. The league really had a few glory moments. Pele came to the New York Cosmos, and for a while fans were thrilled and passionate. 

I watched the movie "Once in a Lifetime" the story of the New York Cosmos, and it seemed like the league could have created a whole new soccer experience for Americans.

I wasn't alive to experience the NASL, so my question for those who were is this: Why did it fizzle out?

<TEXT> This is staggering stuff: http://www.lrb.co.uk/v25/n22/chalmers-johnson/the-looting-of-asia

How can we diminish the importance the potential lowest point humankind has ever reached. The actions of Japan during the 1930's and 1940's brought about what is perhaps the most widespread suffering the world has known.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wish I had been alive--or they would bring back--the NASL. Hockey fans would love it. MLS just is not that exciting. The NASL was able to lure big names like Pele and superstars from Europe. Plus they had probably the most intense post-regulation elimination shootouts. 

Shooter gets 5 seconds to take the ball ~40 yards   crack one on goal. Goalies can charge shooters, sit back, or get caught in no-man's land. Equally intense to the hockey shootout. Check it out: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJEnwi7otu0  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Or... keep it; instead of a 2 min penalty being assessed to the goalie, he becomes a skater who is allowed to handle the puck. However, being that he is outside the trapezoid/ goalie zone, the rules should allow for him to be bodychecked within the rules of checking any other puck-handling skater. I know my grandpa would love to see this, he suggests this every time he sees the damn trapezoid on tv. </TEXT>
