<TEXT> Even though I treat my reoccurring mrsa with my method, about a month ago I saw an infectious disease specialist too see why I was getting reoccurring mrsa infections so often. She told me my reoccurring mrsa was most likely not from an external source but rather lived on my skin. She also told me , assuming it didn't kill me first, my body would eventually figure out a way to remove it from my system. I could have no more outbreaks or a 100 more outbreaks. Sounds as if you your doctor found proper drug plus your body figured out how to get rid of it. Good luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Combining 400nm blue spectrum light from a hydroponic grow bulb, bezethonium cloride mixed with epson salt, and alternation hot and cold.  Go to Blackwell synergy, a peer review search engine, and research each of these ideas. Each of these ideas have been peer reviewed to help with MRSA infections. It is combining all three ideas together and geting the 400nm light from a hydroponic grow bulb that is my idea  and has produced such a rapid and effective respose. People have claimed to treat mrsa infections with 12 watt blue spectrum LEDs. It may work for some people but was a failure for me. My idea, which no one is currently doing, is to obtain the blue spectrum light from a 1000w hydroponic grow bulb. Combining this with the two other methods produced a rapid and effective response to my reoccurring mrsa infections. Before this method, I treated over a dozen mrsa infections with antibotics. After inventing this method, I treated my last three mrsa infections with this combination method and without antibotics. I am giving idea away patent and compensation free. Hope this helps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Our universe could be one of many. There is a strange new theory that our universe is in the center of a black hole. In this theory, the big bang was the moment of formation of this black hole. If this theory is true, that means we live inside a black hole of a "parent" universe. I don't know if this is fact but it would not go against the known mechanics of quantum physics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Language is the greatest invention of mankind but it is also our biggest brainwasher. I like to close my eyes and think of ideas, abstract concepts,and thought experiments through visualization.
It uses a different part of the brain than language
 This overcomes the limations and creative blocks that language puts my the mind under. I invented several ideas with  this method. Tesla use to do this. Would be neat , but not sure how possible, if in the future visualization could be incorporated into language. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Many people say " I don't do anything wrong so why should I care".
There was a film about east germany when it was communist. In the movie, one of the local party bosses had the hots for the wife of one of the films characters . He told the secret service to spy on him to find some "dirt" on him so he could lock him up and have his way with his wife. He couldn't find anything so he used the private information of his phone conversations to frame him. 
" Power corrupts" and " absolute power corrupts absolutely ".
So get a warrent unless you want to live in a police state. If you don't think this couldn't happen in the United States your fooling yourself. Would you like all your phone calls keep in a central database where even your local sheriff could listen to them. This is where this is heading in the future if not stopped. </TEXT>
