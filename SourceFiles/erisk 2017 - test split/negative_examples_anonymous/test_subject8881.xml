<TEXT> I totally agree with almost everything that you say and I'm a big fan of Kubrick, but I still do not see these two scenes being specifically related in any way. I do not think the writers/directors sat down and thought about connecting these two scenes the way you guys are trying to. 

I have watched all the episodes of Mr Robot till now at least 3 times, and I'm in on every single detail. You can check my history if you want. And I still think you are guys thinking about this one way too much, probably become you have been influenced by how smart and well thought out the show has been till now. 

If I were to direct these two scenes, I would do them in the exact same way. In the first scene, Elliot is making a big move, taking on something big, which is going to have an impact on his life, and it makes complete sense for him to take this "one last hit". It naturally follows to place the morphine powder as a long single line, to reflect on its significance/scale.  

In the last scene, the guys are on their way to the Steel Mountain and its the final cut of the episode. This scene is kinda of cliche in movies and tv shows where a road travel to a destination is involved and the scene is the final cut or cuts to a different scene. It naturally follows to shoot the scene the way it was. 

I would not change anything about these two scenes. But to me, all you guys are really doing is, connecting two line segments that make a lot of sense as individual scenes. 

There were a lot of great and well thought of scenes in this episode, but I just cannot see the connection you guys are trying to making between these two as one of them.

[I made a previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MrRobot/comments/3c0nlv/i_think_this_scene_makes_it_super_clear_whos_real/) noting how when Mr Robot is talking to the fsociety team, it's clearly Elliot they are talking to. 
And even in the bartender scene, you can clearly see how the dude doesn't even look at Mr. Robot. 
This is the only scene till now where Mr Robot had a clear interaction with someone which did not involve Elliot.

<TEXT> Darlene doesn't look at Mr. Robot. She rolls her eyes in that direction while still looking at Elliot. And remember that when Mr. Robot cuts off one of the guys, if the theory is true, then it's actually Elliot cutting off the guy. The lady you are talking about is just looking towards the right. She is not looking at Mr. Robot. 

But putting all that aside, after the comments made by u/Bear__Jew, it might be true that the writers are just trying to fuck with out brains. Mr. Robot might after all be real.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Lets talk about some Mr. Robot Theories </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-26 15:59:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Alright, so I watched the first episode just yesterday and watched it for a second time today. Some of you guys have mentioned getting a Fight Club vibe from the show. I think this is a possibility.

This might be a spoiler for few of you, so I'm giving it a Spoiler tag : 
 
[To see how legitimate this theory is, lets establish what we already know. 
 1. Elliot has some mental issues. He is delusional. 
 2. The entire story is from Elliot's point of view, which is not reliable, because of his state of mind. He mentions that "after a through intensive self-reprogramming I now only see Evil corp instead of E Corp" and then for the rest of the episode, even we see and hear Evil Corp. 
 3. This is a strong one : Mr. Robot only interacts with Elliot. If you watch the episode again, you will notice that Mr. Robot doesn't interact with anyone else except Elliot. For the most part, no one even looks at Mr. Robot except Elliot. One exception though, he does try talking to the "Men In Black" at the table who are following Elliot. 
  4. Mr. Robot respected his father, who was a petty thief and is now dead. Elliot was good at talking to only his father. You could say he respected him a lot, like Mr. Robot. But Elliot's father, according to him, died of  leukemia, which he got from the radiation company he worked at.  
  5. Elliot hates the Society, and so does Mr. Robot. "Fuck Society" as they believe.
  6. Elliot is not happy working for his Security Company. He doesn't say it directly, but it's clearly implied that if given a chance to take E Corp down, he would. And Mr. Robot seems to be the guy who gives him this chance.  
   7. Tyrell Wellick, the Senior Vice President of Technology at E Corp, somehow already knew Elliot's name. It might be that he got his name from his employee ID card. But it's never shown. So that's that.   
   8. Tyrell also saw Elliot change the file before submitting it to FBI. But he does nothing about it. 
    9. In the end of Episode 1, Tyrell invites Elliot to his "top 1% of top 1%" meeting, who are probably the board members of E Corp. This could mean that Tyrell was involved in the whole thing from the beginning. It could be possible that he was the one to hire Elliot for the job.](/spoiler) 

There could be few other things I missed out. If you guys also noticed something, mention it in the comments.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like to think what happened was, when you were young, you heard your mom or someone else talk about your great grandfather's funeral, and the whole thing just stayed in your sub-conscious. It then later someday returned perhaps in your dream which later felt like a memory.

Or

When you were young, you were sleeping while someone was talking about the funeral. You were perhaps in the REM stage of the sleep and were dreaming exactly what was being described by that person. That way you got a first person perspective of the whole thing and now remember it as a memory.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I must be bored too to keep this going, but..
1. I mentioned milk from cows. Would have been better if you world have read my original comment in the first place. You are taking one single example and expanding it into a debate. 
2. We humans still do not contribute to spreading their seeds when we have their fruits. 
3. I'm not trying to contradict you. I agree with what you said about hurting and killing animals being unnecessary. The point I'm trying to make is there is more to it than you think. And that, in the grand scheme of things, none of it really matters.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. Agreed. But that doesn't make it okay. Kicking a cat might also not kill it, but that doesn't make it okay. 
2. The plant is not waiting there for an animal to come and pick its fruit. If you want to live a perfect vegan life, why not wait for the fruit to fall to the ground naturally then? And lets admit it, how many of us humans "spreed the seeds" of the original plant after having it's fruit? And that was just a single statement among others, so I suggest you to read the entire comment.
3. That is the statement I was looking for. The admission that we are biased towards animals because it feels "emotionally" wrong to hurt/kill them. Because we relate to them. So its okay to abuse/hurt plants, because it doesn't give a direct/immediate response to our physical attacks. It's okay to interfere with its natural evolutionary process, because hey, it doesn't seem to be crying or something. 

This is not about my argument vs your argument. This is about how humanity works. How we function. It is indeed about the emotional connection, something that varies among individuals throughout the world.

<TEXT> I'm a non-vegetarian and have many a times considered becoming a vegan. Here are some thoughts I would like to share, 

I agree that hurting/killing animals is unnecessary and can be avoided, but is it wrong only because the animals in question are also "conscious" beings like us? What about when we pluck a fruit from a tree? Is that okay because, as far as we know, plants do not have consciousness? The milk produced by cows is not meant for us humans, then why is it okay for us to use for our own benefit? Plants/nature, like us, have the life goal to survive. They produce whatever they produce for the benefit of their own evolution, not to fill our stomachs. Then why would it be okay to stop/interfere with this evolutionary process of any individual plant?     

This can become philosophically very deep. Just because a complex system of atoms and molecules has the ability to make conscious thoughts and receive and responded to strong physical stimuli, it should be avoided from being interfered in its evolutionary process, while doing so to a similar system that doesn't have the ability to make physically/emotionally visible responses to a similar interference is okay? 

And as a non-vegetarian I can tell you that it's not even about non-vegetarian food. We don't eat chicken because its chicken, we eat it because its  **tasty**. That's the main word. It's all for those little dots on our tongue that light up our brain when we have something tasty. If someone is able to invent a food product that is not non-veg and yet tastes exactly like non-veg, I would imagine humanity to probably shift to this new thing. 

I have given a lot of thought to these stuff, and in the end I can only conclude that, in the grand scheme  of things, it doesn't really matter. The list of what is good and what is bad is created, controlled and expanded by us humans and is totally subjective, since it depends on what an individual or a group of people "feel".   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was not pointing to the FCC site. I was pointing to the Reddit posts that brought me and many others to the site. It was posted back in November. 
([r/programming](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2msdo1/a_cautionary_tale_of_learning_to_code/), [r/learnprogramming](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2muc12/cautionary_tale_about_learning_to_code/), [r/learnjavascript](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/2mknfp/a_cautionary_tale_of_learning_to_code_my_own/)). 

Certainly all the commentators on those posts are not bots?  

But if you are looking for something outside the site's domain, here are a few blog posts by some supposedly "bot" members of FCC: 
1. http://www.terakilobyte.com/running-out-of-rocket-fuel/
2. http://crisberrios.github.io/articles/kopernik-first-nonprofit-experience-at-freecodecamp/

And here is a post from the FCC blog shared on Hacker News : https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8965048

But if you really believe with your whole heart that all of this is "spam" then you always have the option to ignore it. Our goal is to provide a service, to help and give directions to a beginner in learning to code. It is not to argue with people on the Internet whether or not we are real.    </TEXT>

If a skeptic is interested enough, s/he would check out those links I posted and find out that this is not even the first time FreeCodeCamp has been linked here. A smart person would take advantage of such a service instead of trying to resist/dodge it so much. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ITT: skeptic people drawing unnecessary conclusions without doing any research. FreeCodeCamp is not a spam, it's legit. There are no bots in this trend, just people who are not so regular on Reddit. Go ahead and [read this article by the founder of FCC from a few months ago](http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2014/11/a-cautionary-tale-of-learning-to-code.html). 
This was the article that got me and many others started with FreeCodeCamp. And I found this article on Reddit ([r/programming](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2msdo1/a_cautionary_tale_of_learning_to_code/), [r/learnprogramming](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2muc12/cautionary_tale_about_learning_to_code/), [r/learnjavascript](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/2mknfp/a_cautionary_tale_of_learning_to_code_my_own/)). 

And, yes, the curriculum links to other free learning resources on the web like CodeCademy, but we also have the Ziplines and Basejumps and Bonfires for practice, which we entirely built on our own. And we also have plans to build our own learning tools in the future. 

I agree the title could have been a little less click-bait-ish, but trust me, FreeCodeCamp is legit and we would be glad to have you as part of the community. :) </TEXT>
