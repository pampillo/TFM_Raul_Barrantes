<TEXT> Do the lip curl thing for sure. I actually combine the tongue push with the cough to get a little more distants and consistency. Also it helps to kind of push out your lower jaw a bit until you find a sweet spot. Another trick is to look in a mirror and try to make a perfect O with your mouth then its all about the push out. But yeah, keep practicing. </TEXT>

"hunted almost to extinction by crazed sub-ohmers, the elusive yeti is sought after for its fine absorbent fur." </TEXT>

<TEXT> No it was kinda an inside joke. In high school when we first got together we tried out a band name generator and Afghan banana stand was one of the results. We hated it but we would keep referencing it constantly so it stuck. Quick story time! We were writing lyrics one day that said something about pushing the principles car into traffic and got sent to his office. When he asked what our band name was our guitarist said Brazilian bikini tan as a joke and so he didn't know our real name which ended up becoming our album Afghan banana stand presents Brazilian bikini tan. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lets say a religious person is in a situation where they are close to death but still have a chance.

<TEXT> This is my hand made variable wattage OKR wooden box mod I made myself. It includes a master on/off switch, fire button, potentiometer, blue LED, and a 5/10 thread to mount any RDA. The internal components include a battery sled, 2 Sony VTC5s all copper wiring, zenor diode, an OKR 1/10 variable wattage chip, a few capacitors, and 4 rare earth magnets to hold on the lid. The wood is hand cut and worked using mahogany and I used guerrilla wood glue to attach the corners. From there I sanded it and stained it.Then did some wood burning  As you can see its a bit haggard from lots of use. It isn't perfect but its something I made and have pride in and something no one else has. This is the first one I've built so the next one I build should be an improvement. Anyways I thought Id share. Open to any questions or critiques.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It doesn't take a scientist to figure that one out. So far your very credible. This is called sarcasm. However, I will answer this... JUST BECAUSE your not being rude *as much*. No I do not think this theory is 100% fucking correct. However plausible because we can not see inside a black hole. Maybe someday we will create something that can pass near the event horizon on a rotating weak black hole and I will be proved wrong (probably not). Until that that day shut the fuck up and stop trying to prove yourself on a fucking Reddit comment section. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jesus Christ! If you want to be an asshole about this whole thing then lets take a look at your beautiful very polite post we have here. Not a shred of reasoning to disprove anything. I thought this was a safe place with knowledgeable individuals. Put down the bong? Really? All I was doing was throwing a theory out there and hoping for intelligent people to explain why this definitively could not work because I sincerely want to know. None of which you addressed. like the idea of that dark matter and black holes may be linked which is probably non-since but I guess ideas (even exotic ones) are worthless to you. I have studied astrophysics, graduated, and somehow I still manage to not be a total dick. I just wanted to throw out a crazy idea that I wanted others to disproof and talk about. After all isn't that the basis of new ideas? Thank you for your very awesome post that will surly incurage me to be less open minded. Much apreciated </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-04-14 21:48:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Does anyone out there have any ideas what might be in the Cincinnati box in the Hot Tub Time Machine movies? I just watched the second one and they mention the box a lot more than the first movie but still no clues to whats in it. If you haven't seen the second movie please still give some ideas because like I said you know just as much about the box even if you haven't seen the second movie. I read that the writers of the films may be trying to make another movie that starts off with this mystery or is based around it but I got the impression at the end of the second movie that they won't be making anymore. Please comment if you have any knowledge about this as well. Remember that the Cincinnati box is a shoe box so whatever it contains must fit in it (or does it?) I'm curious what we can come up with. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the info, I understand all those terms. I have a R/C car battery charger that charges every kind of battery and has build in voltage protection and lots of other features. Would that work as a PCM. Im not an idiot. Its not like im plugging the thing into a wall socket. I have my charger set to charge 2 cells with the combined MAh of both battery's. Now would that work?

This is what I have... http://i.ebayimg.com/images/i/131355448556-0-1/s-l1000.jpg

<TITLE> When chargeing 2 batterys at the same time Do you need a balancer like a 2 cell R/C car lipo battery would? </TITLE>

<TEXT> So I have 2 battery's vertical in there battery sled. One battery with its positive side at the top and the other with its negative side at the top. At the bottom there is a wire connecting the two. If I connect a battery charger to the top of the 2 battery's will they both charge equally? or do I need some type of balancer. These are li-ion batterys.  Thanks in advance if anyone can give me the answer! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for taking the time and writing that up. Its really what I was looking for. My knowledge before vapeing was R/C stuff so I know a lot about Battery safety, wattage, voltage, ext. but terms like Resistance, and Ohms are new terms to me. I am reading all about ohms law right now but would you (or someone else) explain Resistance to me? What aspect of vaping does Resistance effect? Flavor? vape? Heat? 

Edit: Sweetleef took care of it. Thanks! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 1. What is the advantages/disadvantages between tight wound coils and spread out coils.
2. How does the amount of wraps effect heat, vape, ext... (Is is more wraps less heat?) Im looking for a simplified answer even though I know this is a very large question.
3. What is the effect that larger wraps (aka macro coils)and smaller wraps (nano) produce?

Ive been looking for answers to these questions and its hard to come by straight forward answers because I know its not a easy question, but if anyone can simplify these answers I would REALLY appreciate it. Thanks guys! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Find a corner, go under a blanket maybe?, yea a car, maybe the floor in a good spot. I'm sure you can find a spot. A good way to test is to softly let some vape out your mouth and see how it moves. If it just kinda lingers thats fine but if it moves find somewhere else.

<TEXT> You would be amazed of how little air flow can REALLY effect vape smoke. Even when I blow rings over my laptop they dissipate fast because of the computer fan even though it blows down on the desk. My advice is find an area with no air flow and give it a go. Remember to get the smoke in your mouth not your lungs and not to push them out to hard. I use a combo of clicking my jaw a bit and a little push with my tong. Good luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I also read somewhere that Suboxone added the Naloxone to its recipe just so they could patent the name because just bup was taken by the brand subutex and that bup itself is the primary blocker and the low dose of the Naloxone doesnt do much at all. If what I read is right then suboxone and subutex block opiates the same way and you can't feel a p30 on eather. Please help me guys cause I thought this was common knowlage but my friend thinks hes 100% sure. </TEXT>

The swelling went down that night then tonight we tried the Floss trick and that almost worked but it made her finger swell up even worse. But we will take your advice tho. If it goes numb, looses feeling, or stays swelled we will go to the ER. Thanks for the help! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes the silencer is functional and work VERY well at suppressing the sound. It is modeled from how a real suppressor is made and works but with much less expensive material. The barrel is made from 3 aluminum cans (short v8 cans) and the 3 air breaks are made from 3 aluminum energy drinks that have a screw on cap. I also hot glued cotton around the chambers to further reduce the noise which works great. Its amazing the difference. It fits nice and snug with no screwing thanks to a sharpie pen that fits into the 1/4 inch hole after the muzzle. Anymore questions let me know. </TEXT>

I hate when I just finish a piece that I put so much time and effort into and then just get down votes with no comments or reasons for them. I guess what i'm saying is keep your chin up if people want to be dicks. I know I have too. I think your really talented with your digital brush. Keep it up! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes I agree, I thought you were already an artist that has done stencil work before. But for leaning purposes your right on when doing it is simply the best way to learn, so it doesn't matter the content. You can feel how the paint and stencil react to each other, thinness in your card-stock, many things that you don't even consider. In the end just do what works best for you. Just because someone might praise one way of doing things might not mean it works for what your doing. That applies with anything really. I didn't mean to come off harsh I just really hate when people take someone elses work, cut it out, then call it their own. Keep it up. If you have any questions feel free to ask. I like to help.

<TEXT> First we bought one plan at our local skate store but it was too expensive and too big. After looking everywhere online I stumbled onto this plan. It was so detailed and perfect for what we were looking to build. I couldn't tell you where to find it but it was perfect because it was just big enough and if I recall just under 500 dollars. But we had a bunch of left over plywood we stashed under the half pipe. So the best advise I can give is try to find something in your budget, have some friends help you, and get all the material before you start. And make sure that shits level. The surface is 2 layers. First plywood, then skate-light or something similar. Let me know if you have anymore questions.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let me let you in on a secret. Most religions (especially Christianity) are a scam... A fairy tail of heaven to make old people less scared and hell to scare young people into believing. This universe is infinite... having no beginning and no end. This means you are also infinite... Our bodies are like hermit crab shells that we shed after death. Have you ever wondered what the afterlife is like? It is a lot like being born. You don't remember because live is never ending and always finds a way. I figured this out over time and through wise people, and I wish I would have known this as a kid like you because once you realize this (and many other things you will come to learn) you will know true happiness. Life is love and we are all here experiencing ourselves. I have been in your shoes but let me tell you how lucky you really are. You are alive and you have a future believe it or not... and you live in a time and place that is a gem in our universe so take advantage of it and don't listen to these fucking church goers. Find something or someone you love and loose yourself in it and always remember you have an eternity to find piece and happiness and believe me son, you will. I hope this helps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> why yes they are! But I am more interested in seeing a (self propelled)  mortar launch out of a rocket in mid flight and also address the challenge of making it successful. What I think may happen is once the mortars launch out of the rocket, the rocket and the mortar will push against each other and just push apart, making the mortar go up a bit more and the empty rocket shaft go down. Kinda like repelling magnets in zero gravity. Also this is just a first draft of simply an idea. I thought it would be cool. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I still have a lot of kinks to work out. This is pretty much a first draft of a cool idea I had, so not much effort went into the physics of it yet. Thank you for your concern for my safety. I already play it very safe and you are very right about a fail to lift scenario. That would really suck but I would treat it like you said, as a loaded gun. Maybe I will even go as far as launching it from inside my jeep and film it instead of standing next to it just in case.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its nice to hear some support! Everyone is like... bad idea, illegal, wont work. Like I said, this is just an idea I thought to draw out so I wouldn't forget. I wasn't really planing on making it but now I want to make this or something similar . So far I have some great ideas for how to make it work and work safely. Also yes, it wouldn't really matter if the mortars ejected properly (especially at night) because the main goal is to just get the mortars up in the air with fuse lit, so wasn't really planning on being able to recover a (still in one piece) rocket. Even though that would be nice. I will make a video when I get the time to make this happen! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for your words of wisdom. This was just an idea I drew up one boring night. I've posted a lot of these ideas but for some reason this got a lot more attention maybe because of some controversy. But I pride myself on being safe and I probably wont end up making this. If I do something like it in the future I will think of your words. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is just a glimpse into my twisted mind. Probably not something I would carry through with for a few reasons. Not sure if its legal and its defiantly dangerous. And yes I would need to do some real world calculations when it comes to weight and other factors. This is just a concept I though would be cool. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We've already talked talked to our vet and they said it would  be fine to breed her with a small stud. she is an english jack and normal is between 9 to 14 pounds so she is in the norm. We also have a 13 pound female but prefer the temperament and looks of the 10 pound. We plan to keep most of the puppies ourselves and only give a couple to close friends that we know would have time and the love they need. If they need round the clock nursing there is not a problem, I am home all the time and if I go out my wife is home. we don't leave our dogs unattended. and yes the vet would do shots, tail docking and dew claws and any other care they may need from a professional. We did a lot of research be fore we bought our dogs the ten pound is 3 years  old and the 13 is 2.  The breeder we got them from is no longer breeding and we would like to have more like her. we have looked for other breeders for english jacks but they are not very common where we are. we have thought a lot about this and would not do anything to harm either of our babies. I hope this answer all of your questions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes I have come across these a few time's. I think there great. Sometimes I actually prefer doing 3, pink 10mg oxys because it kinda tricks your brain into thinking your doing more than just 30mgs cause you have more powder. But yes these pink 10mg k-56's will have the same effect as a blue 30 if you do three. The extra filler doesn't add up to much. Enjoy!
