<TEXT> It's the original hardcover from January 1996, but the words "First Edition" aren't on the copyright page. What does the number line mean? Can I tell which print it is? Would it technically be a "First Edition # Print? It's never even been read, if it's a much later print, why did he sign it? Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> By the way, I know all about the withdrawals. Hands down worst withdrawals of my life. Those are the kinds of withdrawals they portray in movies (Ray, Trainspotting, Johnny Cash). In movies they're always exaggerated like crazy... but now I'm beginning to think the directors of those movies are just fentanyl addicts.

I've only had acetyl fentanyl once, about 700 mg, and every time after that I've gotten butyr fentanyl instead.... and for some reason acetyl fentanyl is way way way fuckin worse. IDK why. Doesn't make much sense to me, but it definitely without a doubt is. I couldn't even go to work on acetyl withdrawals.... I can't do anything the first day except lay in bed and shiver and shake uncontrollably... butyr doesn't come close to making me do that, and I can go to work on butyr too, although I'm not the most productive on those days, lol.

<TEXT> Butyr is 4 time less potent than fentanyl, acetyl is 15, but other than that, i'd have to say the effects are still the same. I prefer butyr fent by far, since my most frequent  ROA is vaping and acetyl fent just requires vaping too much powder. 

Unfortunately I couldn't compare the duration between acetyl and butyr because as I said above, I can't smoke acetyl.... therefore I ended up snorting it, and I will say that snorted acet does last longer than vaped butyr, but that's to be expected with most anything when vaped vs. snorted, no? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sure it's there, you just gotta find the right people. Tons of people are probably shake and baking. and I'm sure at least a few are doing anhydrous cooks. Your best bet would be to find the anny cooks, because although shake and bake can be decent, most don't know how to do it right. Anny cooks generally have a better understanding of what they're doing. Forget about finding ice though. You'll have to hit up the darknet for that, son. Whatever you decide to do, don't start cooking it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Acetyl fentanyl is 6% as potent as fentanyl. Butyr fentanyl is 25% as potent as fentanyl. So if acetyl fentanyl is being sold for 60 bucks a g, then butyr fentanyl should be somewhere in the range of 240 a g, correct? 

So, go to whichever site you're looking at and compare the prices. The acetyl fent is generally the one that's always priced worse, bang for your buck wise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've argued with people about the "less water you use, the stronger the shot" ideology. It just doesn't make any sense. A quarter g in 10 units of water is going to make you just as high as a quarter g in 100 units of water. The amount of water you use can't possibly make a shot stronger or weaker, less water doesn't equal more dope. The only explanation as to why it may seem like it makes it stronger to some people (not me) is because 10 units of water injects faster than 100 units of water, therefore the quarter g hits you harder, since it's hitting you in a much shorter time span.

 So this may be logical for some people who have trouble shooting, you know the ones.... after 7 minutes and 5 different holes in their body, they finally get the whole thing pushed in, split into thirds between injection sites lol. 

However, I believe it is a bad idea for those people to only use 10 units of water, because time is not on their side, their rigs start to clot up with blood and the less water they start out with, the faster their shit is fucked. 

It's actually funny, my friend (who's an anny cook) sat there and tried convincing me that less water means a stronger shot. You would think a cook would understand why it's not true. Although, this is the same guy that calls pseudoephedrine "pseudophetamine" and thinks that MSM has methamphetamine in it because the first "M" in MSM stands for "meth". 

He was actually the baddest anny cook around, though. Just goes to show you how simple the shit really is to make, any retard can do it. Lol. He just had the technique down is all. He couldn't actually tell you why the reactions happened the way they did, or what was happening, all he could tell you was that you were gonna dry heave when you jammed it in your arm... and he was right. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As other people said, kratom will help tremendously.

I've been through a lot of treatment programs, and they always tell you to never attempt to quit things like smoking or coffee or fatty foods in the beginning of your recovery. It makes sense. Everybody has a vice, you're concentrating on eliminating your benzo use which is far more important than any of your other problems right now. After you get a little sobriety under your belt, then may be a good time to look at your other addictions.

It'll do it going up hills mostly, when trying to accelerate, but it does it here and there on flat land too. I did some research, saw some stuff about catalytic converter and whatnot, I've basically ruled everything other than the engine itself out because it didn't do this at all before the new engine. My best guess so far is the EGR valve? The check engine light comes on here and there, especially when it's happening, but it goes back off. Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Pissing out of my penis and into the toilet </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-01 01:47:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I take 15-18 grams of kratom a day. Mostly red veins.

Because of my moderate kratom intake, I drink a gallon of water a day. 

I also chew tobacco all day long, which makes me incredibly thirsty all the time... I find that may actually work at my advantage  considering the dehydration kratom tends to cause. 

I probably piss in the toilet an average of 18 times a day. 

I realize a lot of toilet-pissing is to be expected when one drinks a gallon of water a day, but I feel like I really need to piss even more often than that should warrant.

Sometimes I'll piss in the toilet, and then 15 minutes later I'll feel like I need to piss in the toilet again, so I try to, and it takes a while for the piss to come out and then when it does, it's only like a 15 second piss. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is, I get the "gotta go piss in the toilet" sensation even when it's unwarranted. Does anybody else ever notice this? 

It's also the same sensation I get when I'm doing meth or amphetamines, I feel like I always gotta piss a little. 

I can sort of understand why that is though, because the crank is speeding my system up and pushing fluids out or whatever. 

Unfortunate thing about meth-toilet-pissing is that I always dribble into my boxers a little bit after every piss. At least the kratom doesn't seem to have the same effect.

I digress.

I also seem to have a hard time getting the piss started. There's a lot of stop-n-go hesitation my stream as well. A touch of misting going on.

Because of this, I started sitting down when I piss. I'd done it before, when I was on opiates sometimes, because I would try to piss for an hour straight, and I'll be God damned if I'm gonna fuck up my buzz by standing there trying to piss for an hour, when I could at least be sitting on the toilet and nodding for most of it.

I own a smartphone. I use it every time I'm on the toilet. This just contributes to the madness. Gotta check reddit, gotta see who's locked up on MobilePatrol, fuck around and post a couple disgusting comments on Whisper, stay up to date with imgur. 

Between the pissing and the subsequent smartphone use, I probably spend an hour and a half on the toilet every day. 

TL; DR    Does kratom make anybody else have to piss when they really shouldn't even need to?

<TEXT> Yeah I guess it can't hurt to swap the filter out and see what happens. Just after the warranty ran out, the brake line blew, and we took it back to the garage, where I was prepared to pay the full fee in order to have it changed, and the guy did it completely for free, so maybe he'll help me out. Lol. Probably not though. Ok, so I just started it up and got it up on some ramps. It was knocking right after it started, then it stopped, I drove it up onto the ramps and while I was driving up the ramps, it started knocking loudly, and the oil pressure light came on. I got to the top of the ramp and put it in park and I hopped out to go open the hood while it was still idling, and then I sort of heard a thunk and the knocking went away and the oil pressure light shut off and then it seemed ok, other than a very small knocking noise, which I could have probably dismissed as normal any other day.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh ok, that makes sense. It didn't seem to be idling lower than usual.  The oil pressure light came on right when I got to work, when we went up the inclined driveway, then it went right back off. The story I told you above, with the stalling, all happened within half a mile from my work. I'm wondering if it's a good idea to even start it and try to drive it to the garage we got it from or not. She just got it like 45 days ago, using buy here pay here at a local garage. Unfortunately it's past the 30 day warranty but I'm hoping maybe he'll do something for us in the way of a trade or something. I'm assuming he'll say no though, since he has the right to. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Two days ago, I changed the oil on my old lady's 2001 Chevy Impala 3800. It has 118k miles. I used a FRAM Tough Guard oil filter, and SuperTech SAE 10W-30 oil. She went to work last night, and this morning she said she heard the engine knocking. She came and picked me up and took me to work, and when we'd almost made it to work, the engine was knocking badly. I told her to pull over so I could pop the hood, and it stalled. I popped the hood, checked the oil, which was right where it should be, and hopped back in and told her to keep driving to my work. It kept knocking, we got there and it stalled. The oil pressure light also came on and back off once or twice. I read that FRAM filters often have faulty anti-drainback valves. Has anybody here ever experienced the same thing? I plan on changing the filter later today, I'm just hoping that will do the trick. I could see it causing the engine to knock and the oil pressure light to come on, but would it cause it to stall? I also checked to make sure the filter or drain bolt isn't leaking. Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's no way of knowing whether it will help the worst of your withdrawals, because we don't know how much morphine will be in your tea. It has the potential to get you higher than kratom ever could if it's a good batch, so obviously that would obliterate withdrawals. There's just no way to know without either doing it or doing some fancy pants lab magic and finding out how much morphine is in it. And yeah, definitely a cross tolerance. I mean, maybe if you sip tiny amounts every day, don't even catch any sort of buzz, and just not get sick... I suppose kratom may work again after a while of that. But I don't really know, there's just no telling with PST.  </TEXT>

You misspelled "speciosa" up near the top of the page. 

You misspelled "difference" in your motto "Smell the difference". I see you "copyrighted" it, you'll probably want to fix that quick cuz a copyright symbol after a blundered phrase looks sort of unprofessional. 

Under "The Truth" page, you have "comeback" instead of "come back", the latter being correct the correct version. 

You also have "headyherb@outlook.com" as your email, which could very well be your email, I just wanted to let you know just in case it's supposed to say "headyherbs@outlook.com".

<TEXT> 5g when you get up, 5g between 3-5 pm, 5g around 9. Keep doing it even if it doesn't seem to satisfy your urge, because you're not satisfied the way you're doing it now anyway. If you stick to that, each day you'll start to feel it a little more, and eventually you'll get back to feeling good from it again. I've done it in this rhythm for six months and it works perfectly for me. Sometimes I took too much for a couple days and screwed up my tolerance, I just stuck to my usual dose and it went right back down. I have one of those nifty 2 and 6 gram scoops from HS, and a scale, although I don't use either because I know what 2g looks like now.  EDIT: I get up at 6 AM. The timing of your second and third dose are obviously relative compared to the time your first dose of the day is. Second dose should be between 9-11 hours after your first dose, and then your third dose would be 15 hours after you wake up, roughly. Might take some tweaking but I think it would work. </TEXT>

I thought I was the only one who felt that way. 

A lot of people say the differences between vein colors are all in your head, but they don't know what it's like to be sensitive to certain veins. It's pretty fuckin blatantly obvious to me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah man, I cannot believe that MS hands out samples and doesn't even clue people in on whether it's an upper or a downer strain. Upper strains seriously make me feel like I'm going to have a seizure. Idk what kind of slick bullshit MS thinks they're up to, they could at least inform people of the vein color or up/down effect. You would think they would at least do that for their loyal customers that pay $50 for 100 grams like it's the only god damn kratom source on Earth. But no, it's all a secret fuck fuck game, as if they have secret formulas they don't want other vendors to steal or some shit. I just don't understand what people see in them. I don't get it, and I'm actually really jelly of MS, cuz those mother fuckers are ballin big dog style. Tons of customers paying that kind of money, I can't even imagine what their profits are like. I hope someday I run a legal racket half as profitable as they do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Smoking black tar heroin can stop your shitter right up. A lot of people here seem to believe that the reason your shitter gets stopped up is because we're consuming all that powder. I personally believe it's the effect of the drug and its alkaloids on your body that cause the constipation, not because of the powder physically stopping you up. I can take Bali from any vendor at 18 grams a day and shit like a pro. But if I throw red vein Sumatran into the mix, as I always do, my shitter jams right up and stops working. You could start taking a tiny 8 mg Suboxone pill once a day and you might not shit for a week, and it's certainly not because the pill is causing some sort of obstruction. It's just what opioid(ish) substances do. Am I saying consuming 50 grams a day isn't going to physically obstruct your bowels to a degree? No, it could certainly contribute, but the primary reason your shitter doesn't shit is because of the alkaloids within the leaf, not the leaf itself.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Alright, I got a safety razor off eBay for 10 bucks, it came with 5 Astra blades. Sometimes i get a halfway decent shave with it (never as good as with a disposable), other times (like tonight) I can't get close at all. I tried getting these same hairs for 20 minutes, couldn't get them, then grabbed a double blade disposable and immediately eradicated them with one swipe. I changed the blade on the safety razor, did not help at all. I also tried all angles of holding it. I shaved with the grain, against the grain, and sideways. I really want to like this razor. I really do. I feel like a big dog when I shave with it but I don't look like a big dog without a big dog smooth shave. Does it just not bend the blade to the correct angle? Would a Gillette Fatboy really make a difference? Or should I just call it quits and go back to disposables? Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

All it did was space me the fuck out and make me feel really uncomfortable and shaky. Sleep was fitful. I got up this morning feeling pretty normal again, I go drop my morning dose and fuckin bam... That bullshit feeling hits me like a ton of bricks again. Now I'm at fuckin work feeling like shit and I'm pissed. I took it last night specifically because I didn't have to work at that time. Am I going to feel it like this at my afternoon dose too? When does it go away? I took it at 8 pm last night. I feel a lot of regret for this decision. It doesn't feel like kratom potentiation at all, I don't even feel the kratom. It's more like DXM potentiation. I feel like I took 150 mg of DXM.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alright, so we all know extracts can fuck up your tolerance. I don't have much experience with extracts, I got some several years ago but I was shooting dope daily and therefore I never really felt it when I took it. Well, today I was on HS ordering some of my usual Green Bali and the Red Vein Thai/Gold Standard extract caught my eye, so I decided to order 2 grams of it. Does anybody have any experience with that product specifically from HS? How was it? My usual dose is around 5-6 grams, should I just take the whole 2 grams?  Is one dose of this extract going to fuck my tolerance up all that bad? Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

You somehow just made yourself into a great example, supporting my earlier reference to your grammar. Speaking of English classes, you should go see if a professor will pay you to be a case study. A lot can be learned by attempting to read the trainwreck nonsense you type up. I NEVER point out people's grammatical errors. I'm far from a grammar nazi.

<TEXT> Ok well I've taken single strains by themselves only about 102746 times, and it never gets me to where I want to be no matter what. Mixing Green Bali with reds is what does it for me. I wouldn't even be taking kratom if I wasn't mixing them the way I do because it wouldn't have the effect I'm looking for. I wasn't asking why I'm not satisfied, I'm asking if anybody else notices the same thing when they first try a new strain. The same thing happened to me with RVS, RVB, RVT, and RV Hulu Kapuas... I took them twice to begin with and didn't feel much, and then after that they started working great. Also, I don't mean to be a dick either, but I find it strange you think I sound like a kid when I'm the one who uses correct grammar, and you can't even be bothered to spell out the word "you". Either way, thanks for the advice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alright alright alright. So I usually take 5-6 grams of Red Vein Sumatran/Green Bali mixed at a 2:1 ratio, respectively. I do this before work in the morning, and then after work in the late afternoon. Then at about 8 I dose one more time, except I substitute Red Vein Thai for the RVS. I do that just for kicks, mostly. Well, the time came to order some more Green Bali, and I decided to cop a 25 gram sack of that Maha Kali everybody keeps going on and on about. Well, the shit came today. I just got home and jammed 6ish grams down my cocksucker, same mixture ratio as usual but using Maha Kali in place of the RVS. A half hour or so has past, and by now, I would usually be feeling great. But at this point I'm actually regretting not taking my usual RVS. I definitely always feel better than this by now. However... I've noticed in the past that the first one or two times I take a new strain, it doesn't seem to do much for me. I'm hoping that's the situation here. Does anybody else notice that happening to them? </TEXT>

<TEXT> lol. I love using my smartphone on the toilet. I dunno about you, but my pisser works funny on kratom. It's sort of stop and go sometimes, and I love using my smartphone on the toilet so much, that I always piss sitting down too. I end up spending like 10 minutes on the toilet every time I piss, and my bitch always ends up yellin at me. She thinks I jerk it in there. Sometimes I do jerk it, though, if it's been long enough since my last dose. Toilet jerks are one of life's greatest simple pleasures. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, call me selfish, but the more it's in the public, the more popular it will get, and the more attention it will receive from authorities. If head shops didn't sell it, it would never even garner any attention from anybody, you know? Sure, responsible people find out about it in head shops and start using it. Kids and people looking for legal highs find out about it too. I would rather just keep it out of the public's eye. I'm sure there's an honest head shop here and there, but it's just not fuckin worth all the publicity it causes kratom to receive, whether it's from honest head shops or elsewhere. Hell, even bath salts and spice would still be legal if it wasn't for head shops (not that they should be, but that's beside the point). Funny thing is, a lot of junkies are too myopic to order stuff from the internet, whether it's from a darknet market or from a website. Doesn't matter if it's cheaper, doesn't matter if it's safer, they can't wait a few days for it to show up. I showed all my friends how to use Silk Road, you know how many used it besides me? One. Just one, and he wasn't opioid dependent, which may have played a role. All the rest just didn't want to wait. Nobody ever wants to wait. Also, most of the junkies I know don't have a debit card, they couldn't order any bath salts from the internet if they wanted to, because they don't have the ambition to actually get a fuckin debit card, and that alone would always stop them. If bath salts and spice never hit head shops, they would both still be legal. They'd just be another couple of obscure research chemicals. TL;DR All head shops aren't bad, but they're all bad news for the fight to keep kratom legal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I imagine they don't buy hard drugs cuz they can't get them. I definitely want head shops to stop selling it. I've never even seen it in a head shop (I haven't been to one in years) but from what I gather, they mostly sell extracts, right? Just goes to show that they're trying to peddle a legal high, and not an herbal remedy... like most of us here see it as. "Bath salts" or "spice" are all the assholes and feds think when they see the shit in head shops. It's a fucked up situation man, and the shit causes me a great deal of anxiety. I don't know what I'll do if it ever gets banned. I hate to think of going on a darknet market for the shit. Next thing I know, I'll have grams of ice and H showing up at my doorstep. But, we all know that for each stupid mother fucker that abuses it and buys it in head shops, there's 10 people that buy it on the internet and use it to improve their lives in a responsible manner. It undoubtedly does more good than harm, I just hope the lawmakers can see that if the unfortunate situation arises. </TEXT>

I love chewin on kratom but I dose at like 6:30 am, and I don't get a dip in until about 7:45 when I get to work. I can't say it really affects the kratom either way for me, although I am pretty much fiending for it by the time I get to work. I just find it makes me want the chaw more. However, thanks to the chaw, I drink about a gallon of water a day... it just makes me so thirsty. I know hydration is especially important when taking kratom, so it works out, as far as I'm concerned. </TEXT>

That's almost 1200 dollars they make just for us to sit in a circle and shoot the shit. It's a fuckin joke. I've done plenty of those outpatient programs, and I must say, if you really want help, go to AA or NA. It's free and it's sure as hell a lot more helpful than outpatient programs... unless, of course, you're mandated to go to outpatient, like I was... then we don't have a choice. </TEXT>

If he drops three with food in his stomach,  he'll likely not even fuckin feel it. #2: He also needs to wait longer than fuckin 20 minutes before dosing more, you crazy asshole. More like an hour. You might start to feel the effects after 10-20 minutes but they're nowhere near done hitting you at that point. I don't feel the full effects until about 40-50 minutes after dropping it on an empty stomach. #3: It's blatantly fucking obvious that both of those are plain leaf. Anybody who's done even rudimentary research on kratom knows exactly what those fuckin strains are, and they sure as hell know the vendor they came from, seeings how it's the most fucking popular one on reddit... if not the most popular period.  #4: WHO THE FUCK PAYS A DOLLAR FOR A GRAM OF PLAIN LEAF?!?!?!?!

No Maha Kali though. I tried asking for it, not realizing they don't give that one out in samples, and I ended up receiving a white vein lol. I was pissed. I just can't bring myself to pay 35 bucks for 100 grams. It won't be long before I cop a kilo of the Red Vein Sumatran from Bikhuk, seeings how it's half the price of HS.

<TEXT> BLUCKA BLUCKA SUP NUGGAH That would make sense, because the Bali I received gave me more side effects than anything. I'm sure I could have talked to Ken about it but it wasn't even worth the aggravation to me. I use Bali every day, I would have to get it from somewhere else regardless. I did receive a sample of White Vein Indo from them, and that was the first and last white vein I ever tried. Nothing against them, I'm just not into the whites. Gives me wicked anxiety. Funny that I shot meth for 7 years but if I try to smoke weed or consume white vein kratom, I feel like I'm gonna have a heart attack. lol. </TEXT>

Having any food in your stomach greatly diminishes the effects... But you probably just didn't take enough. Take 3 g of that RVT and mix it with 2 g of that Green Malaysian. I love RVT but I gotta mix it with Green Bali to get the most out of it. Redosing is cool if you don't feel like you got enough of an effect, but not if you just ate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It will definitely help with premature ejaculation, but it will have a detrimental effect on your sex drive. It's all about timing. Sex might not seem appealing an hour after ingestion, but you'll last as long as you want to in bed. Or in the kitchen... Basically wherever your slampig likes doing it. But there is a sweet spot, somewhere between 3-5 hours after ingestion... at least for me. A little trial and error is in order... but oh Jesus lord, prepare to pay for it dearly if you decide to quit taking kratom. You think you blow your nut quick now? It'll be ten times worse after you quit, until enough time passes by and you go back to normal... which, your normal is premature anyway. It's quite a predicament.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The other day I was feeling adventurous, so I decided to try a 3-way strain mixture. I went 2 grams of Red Vein Sumatran, 2 grams of Green Bali, and 2 grams of Red Vein Thai. About 45 minutes later, I was feeling pretty great, when I suddenly felt the need to shit. I went and got on the toilet and squeezed a good one out. However, I was still feeling quite adventurous, so I decided to wipe from back to front. I've always wiped from front to back, and I was just curious what it would be like to not have to lean off the seat to wipe... I could just reach down between my legs. Unfortunately, because of this, I ended up with a yeast infection on my nutsack. Do not recommend. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to shoot heroin. The first time I ever took kratom, I took 7 grams. I don't know which strain, I didn't know enough about kratom at the time to care. I went from being dope sick to feeling ok in about 20 minutes, it was really quite noticeable. 

I didn't catch a buzz off it at all, I just felt normal again. That was the problem. I didn't want to just be ok, I wanted to be high. I took kratom a few more times at pretty high doses, and then just went back to the opiates.

It wasn't until I went back to prison this last time and got out, that I decided to give kratom a go again. This time it worked great, because I was at baseline as far as my tolerance was concerned. It filled the void I had in me. Even though I'd been sober for about 8 months (I'd used Suboxone in prison in the beginning of my bid) , I still just felt empty. So I gave it a shot and I haven't looked back since. It's been about 8 months. 

The problem is, when he's hooked like that, the mental aspect is half the battle. And having a plant that just keeps him feeling OK is just going to cover the physical side of things, it won't do much for the mental cravings. I would say his best bet would be to (somehow) get off the opiates for about a month and then start a kratom regimen... that way it does something for him both mentally and physically. Other than that, he could start a kratom regimen now and seek outpatient treatment and/or NA/AA for the mental side of things. I don't know. I hope this helps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tobacco: You may crave tobacco more when using kratom. I chew tobacco and I feel nothing extra after I chew, other than I'm always ready for another chaw as soon as I spit my last one out. Food: Always take kratom on an empty stomach, being full can minimize the effects greatly. Some claim eating a small meal 45 minutes after kratom ingestion can actually potentiate it. I've never witnessed it. Soda: Some also say caffeine increases kratom efficacy. Once again, I've never noticed it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 100 mg oral morphine? Forget about it. Kratom is for people who want to maintain, not for people looking to get high. You'll never achieve that sort of feeling from kratom. Come back and give it a try when you're all strung out and out of options. Until then it's going to be pretty useless to you. Even if you take a heroic dose, the side effects will have you fucked up long before any sort of opioid feeling will. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Once I got like 95 Dilaudid 4's and I shot them all with my girlfriend over the course of like 60 hours. I didn't shit for maybe two days, and i didn't think anything of it because I was always doing meth and not shitting a whole lot anyways. Well, on the third day, I suddenly had to shit. It didn't feel crazy or anything, just the normal bowel movement feelings. I went and got on the toilet and I pushed and it felt like the fat end of a bowling pin was trying to squeeze out my asshole. I pushed and pushed and it got just to the point where I couldn't just pull my pants up and get laxative and wait, cuz it was too far out, but at the same time it was still not coming out at all. I tried picking at it, but the way it was shaped it just didn't do any good. After 67 minutes of straight pushing on the toilet, sweatin my balls off, it finally came out. I have never experienced such a relief as I did that day, in that moment. I was so happy, the whole time I was pushing all I could think about were all the times I wasn't constipated that I took for granted. It was really a glorious one. It was shaped like a football and it was easily the widest I've ever had. I almost wanted to weigh it. But yeah so I know what you mean by bein so desperate you want to pick at it.

<TEXT> I take Green Bali and Red Vein Sumatran twice a day, about 6-8 grams total. The Bali doesn't block me up, but the Sumatran does. Most of the time I manage to squeeze one or two small bowel movements a day, but it's common for me to go a few days without having one. It always comes around the third day, but this is obviously not a comfortable schedule. What does everybody recommend to take in order to regulate my bowl movements? I have no plans of dropping the kratom as a whole, or the Red Vein Sumatran, for that matter. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I go 2-3 grams of Red Vein Sumatran to 1-1.5 grams of Green Bali chased with a little ginger ale to (successfully) counteract nausea. I do it at 7 am and then again around 5-6 pm. I think your best way of cutting back would be to stop cold turkey for a few days and then continue at a lower dose, because lowering your dose without clearing your system out might lead to disappointing effect.

I love kratom. It's the shit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like you maybe ought to tackle one thing at a time. That's what counselors suggest and I can see why they do... like maybe start taking kratom first in lieu of alcohol, since I'm pretty sure that's probably your biggest problem. After a few months of stability, then you should try substitution for the caffeine and nicotine. 

That's just my opinion. I understand why they tell you to do it that way... quitting alcohol, cigs and caffeine all at once seems like it could possibly be disastrous before long. Then again, kratom does some wonderful things. Just my 2 cents. </TEXT>

I did them both together for a long time, but then whenever I would smoke weed without being high on opiates, I would get absolutely horrible anxiety. I just ended up quitting weed completely, because it doesn't appeal to me any more... but that sounds kinda the same as you're experiencing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah usually I don't bother responding to articles like that but it put me over the edge when he recommended a benzo. I also just couldn't believe all the comments absolutely bashing kratom. People abuse it in order to get high and then are somehow surprised it becomes a problem for them. I don't use it because I want to get high, I use it because I want to stay sober.

Congratulations on your clean time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've never even heard of this. 2 micrograms seems like a very small amount, since there's 2 milligrams in an 8 mg suboxone strip and that's hardly even really active at an oral dose. Wouldn't taking any amount of nalaxone with opiates just offset the opiate's affinity for the opiate receptors , so taking a small dose of nalaxone would be like taking a little less oxycodone than you actually ingested? Are you supposed to still feel the effects of the oxycodone when you make this combo, and still have your tolerance lowered at the same time? Confusing stuff. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bali and Maeng Da are really at opposite ends of the effects spectrum. If you liked the Bali then you should be looking into the more sedating strains. I personally combine Bali and Red Vein Sumatran, but I have 100 G's of Maeng Da just sitting here because I tried it and I hated it. Makes me all jittery and fuckin like twitchy and light headed and fucks with my muscles. Not fun. </TEXT>

I remembered you mentioned ginger ale, so I ordered some and bam.. gone instantly. I went to the store and copped some 2 liters and came back here for the second dose of the day with a ginger ale chaser and it's all fuckin good. Thanks a lot man (or woman). </TEXT>

I could toss a spoon-full in my mouth dry and chew on it and throw some water in and swish it around and chew some more and just swallow it and it wouldn't even faze me.
