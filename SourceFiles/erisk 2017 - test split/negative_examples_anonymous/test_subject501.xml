<TITLE> New info regarding Corvo's personality </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-22 14:15:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I asked Harvey Smith about Corvo's personality, here's what he said: 

"the kind of man who loves only once. passionate, but private. guarded, analytical, equally prone to long periods of study and caution, and quick outbreaks of creative violence..."

I also asked him what he and the Empress did in there spare time, together. 

"smoke a pipe, play small stringed instruments, climb and swim, cook over an open fire, take small boats out sailing"

Just before we see the body with insects coming out of his guts, on the wall it says 'Howlers come at night'. Because of this new plague that'll be in the game, I think these 'Howlers' will be a new type of weeper. 

Also, those new tallaboy robot guard things look like they have eyes on their lower back. That'll make for an interesting challenge. I could be wrong though. </TEXT>

<TITLE> 5 Philosophies I learnt from the movie 'Fight Club' (1999) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-15 05:56:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **5. Slaves With White Collars  How Advertising Affects Us**

Fight Club is one of those films thats layered like the proverbial onion, except instead of making you cry, it makes you think. One of the major provoking themes of the film is the desensitisation of a generation to our ancestral instincts  like gathering life-supporting resources and continuing our genetic line  and the replacement of these instincts with material and commercial items. Or in other words, working jobs we hate, so we can buy shit we dont need.
Both the book and film focus heavily on this, and in fact director David Fincher is quoted as saying that every scene of the film contains a Starbucks coffee cup. Essentially it points out how our hardwired needs are being exploited and replaced. Instead of having a bigger food pile than our fellow caveman, now we want the most expensive car, the swankier apartment and the designer clothes.
A key part of our evolution is mate selection, and much of this relies on cues of fitness. A landmark study by Buss (1989) suggests that males value reproductive capacity (waist to hip ratio, healthy hair, skin, youth etc) and females value resource acquisition (physically healthy and strong, wealth etc). The reason for this, of course, is that at the basic level the meaning of life is to reproduce and ensure the survival of ones offspring. If a partner is good-looking, this is a sign he/she is healthy and is more likely to be able to foster strong children. If a partner is wealthy there is more chance they can acquire greater resources and ensure the prosperity of the family.
Advertisers know that all this happens at a subconscious level, and they tap into it at will. How often do you see an advert for a perfume or aftershave featuring someone clinically obese, sitting in their clapped out Ford Fiesta telling you how good it smells? Never. Its always the young model with a Gucci dress or an Omega watch getting out of a Aston Martin, or pondering life upon some L A rooftop (whilst not mentioning what the hell it smells of), because thats what hits our evolutionary buttons and makes us want to have that life. The item for sale in half the adverts is irrelevant, its the lifestyle they are advertising.
Yet as cynical as we are, we all know this is a fairy tale. We know that if you buy that car youre not going to become a film star, but we do it anyway. Its this point Fight Club taps into so well, that the greatest trick the advertisers play is letting us think that we came up with the whole idea ourselves, and then making us pay for it.

**4. Youre Not A Beautiful And Unique Snowflake  You Have To Work For Something Meaningful**

Most of us felt it at some point, that we were somewhat special, that we could be just like the people in the music videos, the movies and the television shows. A simple flick through Saturday night prime time TV can show you how much everything is geared towards that flicker of fame, that taste of perceived success. When members of the public are giving hand jobs to farm yard animals (Rebecca Loos  The Farm) or masturbating with wine bottles live on tv for your viewing pleasure (Kinga Karolczak  UK Big Brother 6) you know something somewhere is wrong. As Tyler Durden says weve all been raised by television to believe that one day wed all be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars, but we wont and were slowly learning that fact.. and were very very pissed off.
This is a point thats touched on a little more in the book than the film. In the book the narrator (Edward Nortons character) meets Tyler on a nude beach, where he watches him drag and place logs so that the shadow they cast looks like a giant hand, with Tyler sitting in the middle of the palm. With the changing position of the sun for one moment the hand is perfect. Tyler says that a person has to work hard for it, but one minute of perfection was worth the effort. That a moment was the most you could ever expect from perfection.
If we look at psychologist Abraham Maslows model, known as Maslows Hierarchy Of Needs, right at the top of the pyramid, what Maslow argues is the pinnacle of existence is self actualisation. As he writes in his 1954 paper, what a man can be, he must be. For the narrator, that is what Tyler represents, perfection. For a moment in time he is all he can be.
Now admittedly this meeting is far more symbolic in the book than the film, and I wouldnt necessarily say the books meeting is better. But what it shows is to achieve something meaningful to you, you have to work at it. Now Im not advising you start an underground cult and try to revert our civilisation back to year zero, but you know, maybe write something?

**3. Youre Not Your Fucking Khakis  We Are Not Defined By Our Possessions**

The line the things you used to own, now they own you is possibly one of my favourite in both the book and the film. It may be a very 60s vibe but the concept that we as consumers are more concerned with our possessions than our personalities strikes a particular cord. Think of the grandmother, religiously polishing the family silver they never use. I mean when was the last time you bought clothes purely for their physiological properties? If that were the case, rather than squeezing into an uncomfortable suit, we would all wear our pyjamas everywhere. Ok, I know many a student has taken a trip to the local supermarket in their Hello Kitty finest, but really, would you go to a job interview like that? Oh this, yeah, Spider-Man, whats the pension scheme like?
We buy cars and houses and before long we are working just to pay for our possessions. Then before you know it you wake up at 70 and youre retiring, wondering why you only have 10 years left (if youre lucky) to try and enjoy these nice things youve worked for.
Fight Club bases much of the apathy felt by the narrator on his relationship with his Ikea nest, defining himself by his hand crafted dishes and his Strinne green striped armchairs. But it was when he lost it all that he truly felt delivered. In his book, The Philosophy Of Ownership, Robert LeFevre talks of the history of the idea that an individuals virtue relies on not owning multiple possessions. In Platos Republic, the philosopher Socrates proposes a city in which there is no private property, with its citizens sharing everything. LeFevre also notes that Buddhism and Christianity also emphasise that possessions are a burden to achieving enlightenment.
Simply put nice things are, well, nice, but they shouldnt encompass who you are.

**2. Its Only After Weve Lost Everything That Were Free To Do Anything  Post-Traumatic Growth**

Although this one might be pretty hard to understand unless youve encountered a life-altering situation, the philosophy is sound. The idea that losing all hope is freedom can be seen in how attitudes and mind-sets change following a trauma. In the psychology world, (please take notes class) this is known as post traumatic growth. For example, a 2009 study by Crystal Park (and others) in the Journal of General and Internal Medicine found that 83% of cancer survivors reported a more positive identity.
Two of the leading writers on post-traumatic growth, Tedeschi   Calhoun note how often the attempt to understand human suffering appears in literary works, and therefore as a result in film. In Fight Club trauma and personal growth isnt a result, its the goal. In the book, the narrator says At the time, my life just seemed too complete, and maybe we have to break everything to make something better of ourselves. The narrator creates Tyler to help him change his boring and unfulfilled life, and the only way he could see this creation was through self-destruction.
The difficulty in learning from this philosophy lies in the ability to grasp this new appreciation of the world without having to, you know, nearly die. But the answer could lie with being able to understand the everyday trauma around us. Harness the appreciation and understanding that even if we are not happy with our lives, we are lucky enough to have the chance to change it.

**1. The Ability To Let That Which Does Not Matter, Truly Slide  Dont Sweat The Little Things**

Ok, so were all guilty of this one. No-one can ever really say that nothing gets to them. And sure, its ok to shit yourself when your house is on fire, or you get into a car accident. But whether or not your T-shirt goes with that pair of jeans, or if youre getting too many wrinkles? None of this REALLY matters. In the grand scheme of things, when youre on your death bed, and they ask you what do you regret, no-one is going to say I wish I had chosen the blue sofa instead of the green.
Worry, in an evolutionary perspective, is a good thing. For example, its good to worry about looking as you cross the road, because if you dont youre likely to get hit by a car. However ,excessive worrying  dubbed by psychiatrist Edward Hallowell as toxic worry  mainly focuses on the what if rather than the what is. In an excessive form this kind of worry can sometimes be classed as generalised anxiety disorder, where the worry is disproportionate to the actual problem.
Its this kind of worry and stress that actually makes solving the problem harder, because the brain cant focus on the solution. Its a case of not being able to see the wood for the trees, and if you spend all your energy on worrying about the problem, you cant work out the solution.
In Fight Club the narrator says After a night in fight club, everything in the real world gets the volume turned down. Having gone through a fight (something that would get most peoples attention) the things the narrator used to irrationally worry about, didnt seem as important any more. He realised that most stress and worry is a self created state, and by having something real to contrast it with, hes able to let the rest slide.
 
So there you have it, 5 philosophies neatly extracted from Fight Club. How does the story make you feel and what did you take away from it? Post your comments below, and remember, in Tyler we trust

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I really think he does not get enough recognition for how much of a talented actor he is. Ever since I saw him in 'Drive' (2011) I thought to myself that his career is going places. And now look, he's starring in one of the biggest upcoming films of all time, Star Wars The Force Awakens, and he's also starring in one of the biggest blockbusters of next year, X-men: Apocalypse. But what I like the most is how he's still doing smaller films as well. Just this year he stared in 'A Most Violent Year' along with Jessica Chastain and just recently he was in 'Ex Machina' (which I just saw) which as already made a spot in my top 10 of 2015. He's also set to star in a HBO Miniseries, 'Show me a hero'. Obviously when Star Wars and X-Men come out he'll receive a lot more attention and recognition from people but, IMO, up until this point I think he's quite an under appreciated actor. What do you guys think of him? What's your favorite of his? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not such a good choice in my opinion. Although Jurassic World wasn't perfect, I think the flaws came from the story and writing rather than the directing however I don't think Trevorrow is experienced enough (just judging from his [filmography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Trevorrow) here) to direct a Star Wars film, let alone the the last of the new trilogy. I am very confident that Abrams and Johnson will do a solid if not excellent job directing Episodes 7   8, and I think having Trevorrow direct Episode 9 could result in a bit of a disappointment. But who knows, I could be wrong.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For example, if you are crying, a dog will most likely come up to you and start licking your face or perhaps do something to comfort you.

<TEXT> I agree. On the low chaos ending, we can see Corvo, Sam and a few others at the hound pitts. Corvo is just standing there quietly with is drink, watching the others have fun. I don't know why but that just fleshes out his character much more. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Guy Ritchie's best IMO, followed closely by Lock Stock. The writing is brilliant and often hilarious, I love the fast and edgy tone and editing of the film. One of Brad Pitt's best performances, Statham, Vinnie Jones, Del Toro, and all the others are all fantastic. Would love to hear what you guys think of it.

<TEXT> Jake Gyllenhaal.

He's proved himself an actor to keep an eye out for since Brokeback Mountain. But recently with Source Code, End of Watch, Prisoners, Enemy, Nightcrawler and probably his upcoming movie 'Southpaw' he's proved himself to be a must see actor in ANY film he's in. He's got 3 coming out this year, Southpaw, Everest and Demolition. I'll happily be seeing all 3 of them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The writing can be a bit iffy sometimes but overall I think it's a great western-drama. It's one of those films where the supporting actor is way better than the lead. Casey Affleck in this film is something to behold, his acting was far ahead of Brad Pitt's, and that doesn't happen very often.

<TEXT> As you can all see I am no writer. Within the DCCU, we have Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad and Justice League Parts 1   2 all staring Ben Affleck as Batman. DC have also announced that they are making a single stand alone Batman film JUST about Batman (obviously there will be supporting characters within) whereas Suicide Squad, Justice League and BvS are all feature Affleck's Batman as a supporting character.

In this discussion I just wanted to ask everyone what they would like to see in this stand alone Batman film, what villains they would like to see etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This movie was going to complete my life. Cary Fukunaga writing and directing? Perfection. Two films instead of one? Perfection. A darker and more violent tone than the miniseries? Perfection. Staying for true to the book? Perfection. Will Poulter as Pennywise? Perfection. Well guess what? New Line just have to go and fuck everything up! According to sources, they were going to cut the budget, only allow for one film AND where going to aim it at teenagers or a younger audience. In other words, they were going to give it the shitty, generic, jump scare-filled horror remake treatment that horror movies are getting these days. 

This just sucks. I hope New Line can pull their heads in and give Cary the space that he needs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Prisoners, anything David Fincher especially Zodiac, Nightcrawler, The Chaser, Inherent Vice (If you're looking for a lighter tone, although it has its dark moments), anything Scorsese (but I'm sure you've seen plenty of his) as far as underrated Scorsese films go I recommend Mean Streets and Casino. Also Mystic River is a fantastic crime drama. </TEXT>

He also may have to eat dead children's corpses as well as kill them. Yay! </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-05-16 09:49:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was just thinking, if the director of BIRDMAN thinks Will Poulter is good enough to star in 'The Revenant' alongside big names such as Leo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy, and the director of TRUE DETECTIVE thinks he's good enough to play Pennywise then that must mean that this kid has some serious talent, and we haven't seen any of those films yet.

What are your thoughts?

<TEXT> I feel the EXACT the same way you do. I have a similar first experience with this song. I was in Germany with my family visiting my grandparents, I remember getting Love of Gold for my 10th birthday (Yes, I was way a head of my age with music, books and film; I still am)  and I remember waking up at exactly 7:00 in the morning and walking into the out onto the front porch  with the CD. It was beautiful outside, the sun was rising and the snow was gently melting off the grass and trees; it was beautiful. I remember sitting down and putting the CD in the player they had on the porch. For the whole 14 minutes I was blown away, just sitting on the porch to my grandparents house, looking out across the grass and forest. I'll never forget that day, after that I would listen to the song every morning. It is unarguably one of the best songs ever written and performed. Words can't even describe it. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My idea for the stand-alone Batman film that has been announced </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-30 11:41:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Instead of exhausting Batman's origin story, put him in a completely new setting with characters and themes that we haven't seen before. I was thinking of a Arkham Asylum-ish story. Never have we seen Batman psychologically torn, put him right in the middle of insanity, and see how he pushes through it. Now THAT would be interesting.

For those of you who don't know, Arkham Asylum: A serious house on serious earth is a graphic novel, arguably one of the most disturbing and dark. Basically what it is about is there has been an outbreak in AA and Batman has been requested by the Joker, so he has to go over there to sort everything out. Ultimately, it's a psychological horror book.

The book deals with themes of insanity, and it literally looks like and is meant to symbolize a nightmarish ordeal. What I am trying to get to is that this would be a completely new on-screen reincarnation of the character.

I think we need to see a human, vulnerable and scared batman. Maybe we've already seen that with Nolan's trilogy, but I just really want to see Batman and insanity in the same movie together, and to see how he deals with it and vice versa.

Also, I think going with this tone and story, would bring a completely different take on the DC villains. So batman locks up these villains in insane asylums and prisons, then what? They are left to whither and die in filthy and disgusting environments. Seeing this I think would be brilliant.

Let me know your thoughts! I would love to hear other people's opinions on this. Yes I know, I am no writer. If you still don't know what I am trying to say, just comment or PM me, I'll be happy to elaborate.

TL;DR - I want to see [this](http://www.merlininkazani.com/images/games/7764/galeri_4.jpg) on screen

edit- of course all of you know what Arkham Asylum is! Duh! (stupid me) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree. David Ayer nor Zack Snyder are perfect directors, with that said they have done VERY good movies in the past. End of Watch is one of the most underrated movies of the decade and, personally, I enjoyed 300, Man of Steel (although far from perfect)and Watchmen.
I'm hoping they don't stuff up the iconic characters they are dealing with. Both films have potential to be really bad, but they also have potential to be really really good. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, IMO, this is the best thing Marvel have done. It is (**IMO**) better than the first. It is slightly better than Daredevil, but I think it's a little unfair to compare those two as they are completely different. 

You get to spend a lot more time with the Avengers as characters, the humor is more present and a lot better than everything Marvel have done, the action is better handled than the first, the villain is much more interesting and funnier than Loki (not to say that he was a bad villain) and there's more Avengers- Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch and Vision (ESPECIALLY Vision) make great additions to the team. It improves upon everything!

<TEXT> American Beauty and Fight Club made me have a completely different outlook on life. After watching those films, I decided that I would NOT get a job where I'm stuck in an air conditioned room for hours on end doing a job I hate. I thought that waking up every morning at 7:00 and driving to the same place in the same clothes doing the same shit was NOT the definition of life and living. Unfortunately, I find myself looking down at these people who are stuck in this world; prisoners unto themselves and their jobs. I need to live, I can't be held back by working for people I despise. I want to be a cinematographer, a job where I can be outside and in different environments using my hands and skills to create films; a job where I meet different people, a job that I can learn and grow into.

Also, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipe6CMvW0Dg) youtube video also helped shape my new way of thinking.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah true. When the new 'It' remake comes out, I think it'll be very very good. It might have what your looking for, as it is about friendship and growing up, just with an evil ass demonic alien in there somewhere. (The book) is a beautiful coming of age story, I highly recommend it. But yeah the movie when it comes out will be just what you're looking for if it's good, which I'm sure it will be.

He'll do over a hundred takes of a scene just to get it right, I think people need to appreciate that. Apparently the other 2 are still going to happen, which makes me very happy. If you liked this then definitely check out his other films, especially Zodiac.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> The statue is not CGI, or the graffiti.

At some point in the film, public opinion will go against superman. Maybe something will happen, I don't know. 

When that 'something' happens, that's arguably where Bats comes into it.

People will turn against Superman in this movie, he might lose friends, politicans will want him, the military will want to contain him, all sorts of variables have been brought into the game as described by the teaser. So despite all this, will superman lose it? Will he lose faith in humanity? How do we know he won't be influenced by a villain, or be corrupted in some sort of way? The theory is that batman will be this sort of test, physically he wouldn't be much of a test, but mentally he would be.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> My idea for the stand alone Batman film that DC have in development. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-18 12:23:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Instead of exhausting Batman's origin story, put him in a completely new setting with characters and themes that we haven't seen before.
I was thinking of a Arkham Asylum-ish story. Never have we seen Batman psychologically torn, put him right in the middle of insanity, and see how he pushes through it. Now THAT would be interesting.

For those of you who don't know, Arkham Asylum: A serious house on serious earth is a graphic novel, arguably one of the most disturbing and dark. Basically what it is about is there has been an outbreak in AA and Batman has been requested by the Joker, so he has to go over there to sort everything out. Ultimately, it's a psychological horror book. 

The book deals with themes of insanity, and it literally looks like and is meant to symbolize a nightmarish ordeal. What I am trying to get to is that this would be a completely new on-screen reincarnation of the character.

 I think we need to see a human, vulnerable and scared batman.
Maybe we've already seen that with Nolan's trilogy, but I just really want to see Batman and insanity in the same movie together, and to see how he deals with it and vice versa.

Also, I think going with this tone and story, would bring a completely different take on the DC villains. So batman locks up these villains in insane asylums and prisons, then what? They are left to whither and die in filthy and disgusting environments. Seeing this I think would be brilliant. 

Let me know your thoughts! I would love to hear other people's opinions on this. Yes I know, I am no writer. If you still don't know what I am trying to say, just comment or PM me, I'll be happy to elaborate.

TL;DR- I want to see [this](http://www.merlininkazani.com/images/games/7764/galeri_4.jpg) on screen. </TEXT>

What does this mean? Is he working on something right now? I am so confused, I have found so many different things on the internet about what is going on with him. Can somebody PLEASE explain what is happening? Thanks so much!!

<TEXT> Maybe I'm over-reacting a bit, and I normally take documentaries with a grain of sand, but this just really got to me. I just cannot believe what these bastards have gotten away with and how they treat their people. How they practically used people, such as Tom Cruise, to gain power and superiority. Also, how they basically destroyed his marriage to Nicole Kidman. Don't even get me started on that bastard Miscavige....

Like I said, how true can all this be? It seems pretty legit to me. I just wanted to see if anyone else feels the same way :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> What I mean is I didn't feel that the first one had the characteristics of a film, it didn't present itself as a MOVIE. I know that sound ridiculous and I probably will be downvoted but it's just how I feel. Don't get me wrong, I LOVED The Avengers, but throughout my life I wanted to see the characters that I grew up with put into a motion picture. Unfortunately, It just felt like an entertaining but shallow action film. I wanted more, I wanted a more 'cinematic' feel and look to it, and now I think that Joss Whedon has implemented this 'feel' into AoU, just judging by the 3 trailers. You get me

From what I've seen as far as trailers go, I think the film has a much more 'cinematic' vibe to it. I can't say for sure, as I have not seen it yet. I hope it does turn out to be like that, as I believe that's how superhero movies SHOULD feel. Anyone else feel the same way? I would love the discuss this further. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> So happy to hear that. I've actaully played a little bit of unity, the combat was great, as were the costumes, weapon selection and world design. I think it's worth getting just for those things alone. I've heard bad things about the missions and the story and lots of bugs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Totally, talk to to me about anything. I used to play PC, my rig was soooo shit (i played on intel HD graphics). I played games like far cry 2 (one of my all time favs), skyrim, mark of the ninja, counter strike, the first assassins creed( again one of my favs). just games like that really, buuuuut i recently got a PS4, what an upgrade right? It's been great, i've just loaded up on games like gta 5, AC black flag, watch dogs and far cry 4. some of them are a little too disturbing for my taste (watch dogs) by i enjoyed all of them.

when you do finish work and go to the gamestore etc just have a think about the things we've been talking about previously, that should help a little.  </TEXT>

I never mentioned, i loved video games as well, feel free to talk to me about them. If your co workers are like that then yeah I do understand your situation, at least you have your cousin, family can be friends as well. Insurgent? not bad at all. summer (in america) is coming up so that's when all the awesome movies come out, like i cannot wait for Avengers age of ultron. 

If you don't mind, every few days i would like to PM you just to see how you are doing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am so happy that this is getting you to think. Please tell me what you want to do after your shift. Dogs are great, I recommend you look into that.

As for your coworkers, I see the problem. I think you can still form friendships among them, even if your interests are different. You strike up small talk and just go from there. Are they friendly? I find that talking about recent news, world events etc works a lot of the time, as most people are interested in these things.

Most of all I think you need time to yourself. I mean like taking a day off work as I mentioned or doing alternative things after work like going to the park, beach etc these things can help more than you think; just some peaceful time for self reflection. If you do end up watching the films I recommended please tell me what you think of them and if they impacted/affected you in any way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hmmmm yeah you really need to watch those movies I recommended. Fight Club changed me as a person, as did American Beauty, as both of the main characters in those films were just like me a few years ago and little bit like you too. If I changed, I believe you can too.

You said you have a full time job. Why not start looking for friends there? Or maybe a girlfriend. 

As for the drive home, eat dinner, bed at 10 thing, you really need to change that, as I can see that's part of what's dragging you down. Who told you that you HAVE to go to bed at 10? Who ever said you HAVE to go to work? Or even come home from work? Just take the day off one day, go to the park or beach or movies, just have a day to yourself. Pick a sunny, BEAUTIFUL day. Also, how about a pet? Dogs can be best, BEST friends. They can cheer you up, you can take them for walk, talk to them etc. You don't have to do the exact same crap everyday, no one ever said you did. We were put on this earth to live, you feel the emotions embedded in us, not be prisoners unto ourselves, and not to waste away our days. Is that how you want to remember your life? Doing the same things everyday? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know exactly how you feel. 

I used to be like you.

I recommend you watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipe6CMvW0Dg)

I keep happy using these 3 principles:

**1. (The most important IMO) Lotsa good movies, books, music and T.v shows**

That's right. I mentally deteriorate if I don't get good entertainment. It's important to me, it is what I value. I try to go to the movies as often as possible and I collect blurays and try to watch a movie a day. I also listen to a wide variety of music. Good music, not shit. This includes Elton John, Pink Floyd, ELO, Queen, David Bowie etc. Good books do the job as well. I LOVE Stephen King and I LOVE batman comics. That's just me. It's things like this that make us human.

**2. FRIENDS!**

You NEED people to talk to, it is an absolute necessity. And remember, it's QUALITY not QUANTITY. I have a medium-ish circle of friends who I am all close to, and they love me and I love them! If you are having a shitty day then you can ALWAYS talk to a friend about it, they will always listen, and that can help more than you may think.

**3 AN ESTABLISHED WAY OF SEEING THE WORLD THAT ISN'T NEGATIVE**

You need to know where are are and what you are. That may sound stupid, but you need to embrace everything. You are a living organism. We were not created by a superhuman being or whatever, unfortunately we won't find out until the day we die. But until that day we need to LIVE. Don't waste away your time, you are a human being for christ sake!! MAKE YOUR MARK ON THIS EARTH, you will only live once!! You need to have your own way of seeing things that isn't overly pessimistic or optimistic. I am a little bit in between. Also, try not to worry to much. I know a few people who let things like world hunger, poverty, terrorist attacks etc get to them, and I can see how much it drags them down. Don't let that terrible stuff get in your way!!! The way I see it, it's all background noise, unless it comes to me, which it never does.

Anyway, enough about me. Tell me about you. I really do want to help you out, and I will try my best.

Also, watch the following films (they helped me):

American Beauty (1999)

Birdman (2014)

Fight Club (1999) 

Silver Linings Playbook (2012)

Hope this helped, please respond!!

<TEXT> Personally, I enjoyed the first. The second? Not so much. To me the second volume was Von Trier's typical pessimistic style of film making and to a degree the first volume as well. But the ending to the 2nd volume really bothered me. As I stated before, It is a very pessimistic film. You are basically watching a character on a downward spiral, but the 2nd volume just went full Von Trier-hate the world mode, and I did not appreciate it.

Back to the first volume. Like I said, I genuinely enjoyed the first film. Although I would not watch it again, it was probably the most realistic you can get when covering that subject matter, and it didn't go over the top with it. Now you're probably think to yourself 'well, yes it did. Just look at the sex scenes!'. But the thing is, like I said, this is the most **realistic** take on this subject matter as you can get. And so while the graphic and sometimes unwatchable sex scenes are pretty intense, they are not over the top and gratuitous; they are simply realistic.

Anyway, that's my thoughts on the film. Please don't downvote! There is no need to as these are just my opinions. Yes I know my grammar is all over the place; I am not much of a writer.
I would love to here your thoughts on the films, like I said, please don't downvote if you disagree just post your argument in the comments and I will be happy to discuss :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everyone in this thread seems to think I don't have very good taste in cinematography. Yes, I have seen many, many films; but Interstellar has some of the best cinematography I've seen in a while. Some of my favorite DP's include Roger Deakins, Emmanuel Lubezki, Robert Elswit, Conrad L Hall, Vittorio Storaro.  

Some of my favorite films feature astounding cinematography these include American Beauty, Blade Runner, Alien, No Country For Old Men, There will be blood, Fight Club, Zodiac, Se7en, Inglorious Bastards and many others.

It's just my opinion, but I think Hoyte van Hoytema did a very good job in this film along with Chris Nolan. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Mary   Max: my favorite black comedy. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-15 08:52:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There's a constant stream of animated films these days, but mostly they're either glossy Hollywood product (Pixar/Dreamworks), or Japanese anime. For adults wanting something different we have to wait for the likes of The Nightmare Before Christmas, Waltz With Bashir, Persepolis, or Aardman's films to turn up. Mary   Max is one of these films that comes as a complete departure from all the others, both in visual and storytelling style, and sticks in the mind because of it. I won't repeat the plot here, so I'll just mention a few pros and cons. The cons are obvious. Some people will be put off by the almost constant narration (which took me a while to get used to), the rather numerous calamities (a lot more than you'd expect if you thought this was just a kids film), and the sadness within some of these people's stories. It's actually a little surprising that the film got made without the people financing it demanding a script that was more tailored to appeal to a wider audience. What we get is something that feels a whole lot more personal than the higher profile animated films. It feels personal, and therefore real, and the explanation is that it was written from life by a director who has a real feeling and sympathy for people who don't quite fit into the world, and feel alienated or are misunderstood by others. Mary was partly inspired by the director's own childhood (and there's a little bit of Toni Collette's Muriel Heslop thrown in I suspect), and Max is also based on a real person he's been pen friends with (but so far has never met in person). The way the film handles his Asperger's Syndrome just feels different to how you'd normally see such an issue handled on screen. There's a constant stream of humour (ironic, dry, black, childish), and I really enjoyed the small perfect touches on growing up in an Australian suburb in the 70's and 80's, and the depiction of grey New York, as it appears to the easily frightened Max. The animation is constantly a joy to watch, and I highly recommend seeing it. Not to mention the top-notch voice acting from Philip Seymour Hoffman, Toni Collette and Barry Humphries.

<TEXT> Direction is kinda weak at times and 'one note'.

The acting is pretty good.

Writing can be a bit flat at times but overall it's ok.

The cinematography...do I have to say anything? Roger Deakins yet again delivers a visual feast, every frame is crisp and balanced, the lighting is beautiful; it deserved that oscar nod. </TEXT>

<TITLE> TIFU by putting a frozen steak on my face overnight </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-09 14:10:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So lets just start by saying that my eyes get really itchy when hop into bed. I don't know what is is but as soon as I lay down, they get all tingly and irritated.
So most nights I lay there rubbing my eyes for about 5 minutes or until I think enough is enough. 
I then usually stumble out of my room into the kitchen to get a cold flannel to put on my face.
The previous night I decided to put a flannel in the freezer to put on my face/eyes if they become itchy, which they did. 
So I got into the kitchen and staggered over to the freezer, seeing nothing but colors and shapes from the good, vicious and long rubbing that I gave them (come on it feels good), I opened the freezer (all lights were off btw) and grabbed the first thing that felt like a nice thick frozen flannel. I then zombie-walked my way back to my room and put the ice-cold solid piece of heaven on my face. 

Well I woke up the next morning; the pillow was red and so was most of my face. 
I thought I was in that scene from The Godfather, seriously, I was shitting bricks.
I then feel a soggy, warm and wet sludge-y like presence against my upper back/neck area. 
Well what do you know? It was the steak I was supposed to cook the previous night, wrapped in glad/plastic wrap. Most of the blood had leaked out from it and onto my face, pillow and some of my sheets. 
And of course the REAL frozen flannel was sitting in the freezer where I had left it. I swear it winked at me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well for starters, and I forgot to mention this, but Cuaron did not deserve Best Director, that should've gone to McQueen. 
Best Picture nod for Gravity was, to the academy, a no-brainer but come on BEST picture? That nomination should've gone to Prisoners.
An Bullock nominated for best actress? really? That nomination should've gone to Emma Thompson or someone whose performance was better.
When I said 'that years gravity' to 'Shakespeare in love' I did mean nominations as well as wins. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I remember watching this trailer that was a spin off/parody of the cheesy 80's retro action movies, it was a bit like Far Cry 3: Blood dragon in its style and in the trailer it was about a vigilante cop type-a guy who is sent back to fight the Nazis but is instead sent back to the dinosaur age. I know it sounds really weird but the trailer was awesome and anyone who knows about this movie please comment the title or link to trailer in the comments. Much appreciated :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just wanted to ask /r/movies what everyone thinks of The Reader, a 2008 film starring Kate Winslet, David Kross and Ralph Fiennes.

Wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Reader_%282008_film%29

I think this is an incredible film with powerful and convincing performances from all three leads, this film is certainly not for everyone and it raised quite the controversy when it was released but nonetheless critics and people I know really liked this film. So yeah I just wanted to know what people thought of it, please leave your thoughts and opinion(s) in the comments. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> At the beginning of the film where the drums play away the letters and start to reveal the title of the film it pauses briefly and across the screen you can see the word 'Amor'. Amor, as it turns out, is the ancient Roman God of love (aka Cupid) Amor is also Latin for 'Love'. I did more research and as it turns out Amor is winged and is often depicted as being blind or blindfolded. Now you must also consider the name of the play that the plot (sort of) revolves around. And know a quote from Shakespeare's A Midsummer Nights Dream:

Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind
And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.
Nor hath love's mind of any judgement taste;
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste.
And therefore is love said to be a child
Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.

IMHO this quote is referring to Riggan Thomson (or is it the other way round?) The director and writer, Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu, is not directly linking Riggan to Amor (or Cupid) but simply a homage or tip of the hat. As the title of this post suggests I may be onto something here and if I am then I am no where near fully understanding this reference. I thought I might share this with you guys and perhaps discuss even further. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> This album reflects humanity. The good. The bad. And the ambiguity of it. Most of this album is actually a continuous song. Most of it. The songs within this album evoke mostly dark emotions, but they are very relaxing. The lyrics of these songs deal with some very heavy themes. Mostly, like I said, to do with humanity; society. But the themes and ideas displayed in this album is familiar territory for this band. They are certainly not for everyone, they are for me and hopefully for you, too.
