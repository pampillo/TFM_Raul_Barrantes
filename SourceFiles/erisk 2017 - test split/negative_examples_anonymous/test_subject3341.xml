<TEXT> I don't think it is all that bad, provided you have an absolutely solid grasp of math. You're taking basically three full math courses (four, if you include stats) that they really expect you to take only one of every semester. Each will have long, weekly assignments, multiple tests, probably around the same time, and pretty brutal finals. Add 122 and Thermo on top of that, and you might as well kiss your free time goodbye, unless you really really enjoy math and are exceptionally good at working *quickly* through it. 

Also, Mihai is absolute garbage. I have also heard Steif is not good either.

I would recommend spacing out these difficult math classes over the course of more semesters. Knock out a few required electives instead of trying to get through all the gen eds as fast as you can.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The new facilities are reported to be ready and open by the time fall semester starts, but we all know that there are most likely going to be delays. In the meantime, there is Skibo gym, which has a modest collection of weights. 

The smaller gym in the CUC is still open on and off during the renovations, you will just need to check since the closings aren't scheduled. Though this gym is mainly equipment and dumbbells, no bench press benches or squat racks, so if you want to do heavy lifting you will want to go to Skibo anyways.

<TEXT> SOLD!

Hi everyone!

I have a 3DS XL in Blue/Black for sale. It's in great condition, didn't get it all that long ago. The only damage is two very small chips of paint right under the front cameras, barely noticeable. Everything else is perfect condition. It's still under GameStop warranty (they'll replace any damage no questions asked) until October of this year. I'll include receipt so you can redeem if necessary. 

Will come fully reformatted and ready for a new user/system transfer. Will not include a charger. You can grab a USB Charger from Amazon for about $5. Running version 9.5.0-22U

Selling because I got a New 3DS XL. 

Thanks for looking!

Honestly $100 is already a pretty good price so I wouldn't go lower than that. I could sell it on eBay for more but that's kind of a hassle with Paypal fees and what-not.  </TEXT>

Again, this device is under GameStop warranty for another 8 months. If ANYTHING goes wrong, you can bring it to GameStop and they will replace it for you no questions asked. I will give you the receipt so you can redeem this if needed. The receipt has the serial number which matches that of the device.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Upon closer inspection it looks like there are tiny chips above the two cameras on the front face. It doesn't look bad (I honestly didn't notice anything wrong when I first got it until I inspected it just now). Nothing else is wrong with it. 

In truth, I am the second owner. I bought it in a bundle with a few games only a few weeks ago in the intention of selling the console after getting the New 3DS XL.

<TEXT> I was also kind of hesitant on the MM version but I definitely wanted a New 3DS XL. I heard there was going to be a limited supply of both (obviously much less MM editions) so I went down to Target right before opening to try my luck and get at least one system. 

I managed to get a system and my god it is GORGEOUS in person. Pictures really don't do it justice. The gold is dark and understated, and while I usually hate glossy finishes this one looks so damn sophisticated, like the decals are infused with the system. I feel like a matte finish would have made it look sprayed or stenciled on. 

If you have even the slightest inkling for keeping it I would highly recommend it.  </TEXT>

They didn't have any of the new 3DS XLs in the case, though they probably didn't put them out by the time I got there. Worth a shot if you're still looking.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I completely agree with you. It will be acceptable to some, and unacceptable to others. It doesn't offend me, and has never offended me. It's just something that I personally wouldn't do if I didn't have to wear glasses, given my (admittedly pretty strong) personal moral values. 

As I have said from the beginning, these are my opinions that I offer as someone who does actually have to wear glasses. I'm not trying to convince you or anyone else to do either way; these are just my thoughts on the matter. Make of them what you will.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, it's definitely an extreme case that isn't really the best example. I'm just saying that some people might extrapolate to that. Granted, people actually do some really dumb stuff to try to look cool sometimes. I have heard of people breaking their own arms in middle school to get a cast to look cool. 

I posted a follow up to my comment that I think really explains my reservation against wearing glasses purely for fashion. Please give that a read and tell me what you think. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay here are some follow up thoughts. 

The whole point of MFA, in my opinion, is getting clothes that compliment your body shape, style, and personality. We do this because everyone has to wear clothes, and how you look is a big part of how other people perceive you and your personality. To me, the most important part of clothing is being true to yourself and your personality, and not trying to trick people into thinking you are something you aren't. It's like wearing biker gear to try to get a girl who likes bikers to like you. It might work, but then you aren't being true to who you are. And when people find out that you are, in a sense, lying about who you are, they tend to get a little angry. 

Sure, glasses might compliment your facial shape, and make you look smarter and more appealing to other people, but it's not necessary for you to wear. As such, it might seem like you are being deceitful and tricking people into thinking you are something you aren't. If you are really smart and nerdy, people will know it without you having to wear nerdy glasses to show that, and you wouldn't have to wear glasses to prove that to people. I wear glasses because I have to wear them, so I might as well pick a pair that both looks good and conveys the style and personality that I am; not to try to be something I'm not. 

I will admit, it is a definite gray area. It will offend some people and won't offend others. I definitely think about fashion fairly differently than most people on this sub I think, so my word might not be the best to listen to. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's akin to wearing a cast if your arm isn't broken to look tough, putting an athletic bandage on to make it look like you work out, or talking in an accent to make you appear more worldly. Remember when Bluetooth headsets were a thing? Sure they may have served a purpose, but wearing one when you weren't taking a call (ie. when they weren't necessary) was pretty douchey. In my opinion, the only saving grace is that no one will know. But to those who are slightly knowledgeable about glasses it's pretty easy to tell whether lenses are prescription or not just by looking. 

The fact that you want to wear them to look "smarter" or more like a nerd worries me. I feel like it's kind of playing into a stereotype more than anything. Would you go so far as getting a surgery to look more Asian since Asians are stereotypically perceived as smarter? But then again, it's like dressing with well fitting clothes to make you appear thinner or more athletic than you are, so that may be a moot point. 

I think if you want to go for it, go for it. I've met a few people with fake glasses, and I haven't really held reservations against them once I found out they were fake. 

Full disclosure, though: my vision is bad enough that I need to wear glasses to drive or read the board at school, but I can function completely fine without them. Before I joined MFA, I carried around a pair to use at school, but once I got a pair that were relatively stylish and actually complimented my facial shape, I started wearing them all the time. For me, it was a combination of it both looking nice and being more convenient if it forgot to take them with me somewhere. I guess you could say I am wearing them to look better, but I also get actual utility from having better vision. But then again you might be getting more utility from looking better too. And some people definitely do look much better with the right glasses... 

... Now I really don't know what to think. 

Sorry I can't give you a more definitive answer, but there are my thoughts on the matter for you to consider. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This review contains only information about my experience with the Oneplus One coming from a Nexus 5. It will not talk about software, as software is so customizable I don't even consider it a factor in the purchase of an Android phone anymore. 

Right before the ball dropped for New Year's, the dreaded happened: I dropped my beloved Nexus 5 and shattered the screen. Thankfully, everything still worked, but shards of glass were flaking off and were posing a hazard to my clothing. My Nexus 5 had served me faithfully for over a year, and it seemed like the time had come for it to retire for the next latest-and-greatest. 

I had had my eye on the Oneplus One as soon as it had been released, and it was my natural choice for a replacement. I purchased an invite off of eBay (this was before I discovered this subreddit!) and in about a week I had my new Oneplus One. 

Now, less than 14 days after shipment, I have decided to return the One. Here's why. 

GENERAL REVIEW

**Packaging**

* [Yeah, it's really nice](https://forums.oneplus.net/attachments/11-jpg.11235/). The cardboard is some of the heaviest I have seen on electronics packaging. The inclusion of an additional Nano SIM adapter is a really nice, super thoughtful touch. The USB cable is top quality, and the SIM tray ejector comes in an over-the-top [silicone keychain holder](http://www.gsmdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/OnePlus-One-review_026-660x495.jpg). The [charge block](https://forums.oneplus.net/attachments/us_charger-jpg.163435/) came in it's own, separate box, presumably to account for different outlet standards. It looks good and is well build. Very impressed so far, especially for a $350 device. 

**First impressions**

* Wow, this thing is big! I did not expect a 0.5 inch size increase to result in such a drastically bigger phone. My Nexus 5 could [basically fit inside the screen](http://cdn03.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/oneplus-one-vs-nexus-5-aa-25-of-28-710x399.jpg) of the Oneplus One. 

* The build quality is fantastic. The silver metal border isn't a super shiny chrome and brings a pretty good amount of class to the device without being too gaudy. The sandstone back didn't feel as great as it was hyped to be but It does feel nice. It's a nice departure from the deep, all black design of the Nexus 5. I would equate the Oneplus One to a [Lamborghini](http://www.caradvice.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Lamborghini-Huracan-2.jpg) and the Nexus 5 to a [stealth bomber](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/US_Air_Force_B-2_Spirit.jpg)

**General Build Complaints**

* The buttons are really flush with the sides of the phone, and don't have very much travel distance when pushed. The volume rocker is small (it could pass as a single button), which makes it hard to find and press which volume button you want in your pocket. 

* The power button is closer to the center of the phone than the top. On the Nexus 5 it is almost right at the top. My thumb does not naturally fall on the button when I am gripping my One normally (it lands a little above), like it does when I hold my Nexus. This is not necessarily a bad thing, since it gives you a slightly more secure grip on the phone since you're not afraid of pressing the button accidentally. However, I don't think this was an issue to begin with. I never had that problem when I used my Nexus 5, and the buttons are flush enough and have such a high actuation force the I wouldn't be afraid of pressing the button even if it were right under my thumb. 

* The SIM card tray is awful. It is plastic, unlike the machined metal of the Nexus 5 or any other flagship phone now for that matter. The SIM does not sit very securely on the tray (it can wiggle around a little), and made me question whether I was inserting it right on first try. Also, the fact that you can actually insert the SIM incorrectly is an absolutely TERRIBLE design oversight. The sheer number of complaints of people inserting their SIMs upside down is just ridiculous. Always assume your customers are absolutely stupid and make it impossible for them to mess up anything. 

* The raised glass on the front makes me never want to place my phone face-down. Ever. 

**Comparisons**

* Screen: Yes, it is much bigger. It is by far the most comfortable phone for me to use with two hands. I never have to squint or strain at all to read anything on this screen. The colors are slightly truer and more muted than the Nexus 5, but with software tweaks this is a non-issue. I happened to get one with the dreaded [yellow tint of death](https://forums.oneplus.net/attachments/yellloopo-jpg.78216/) but it does go away after a short-ish amount of time. 

* Speed: I flashed both phones to a fresh Cyanogenmod 12 to test this. It definitely feels a slight amount faster than my old Nexus, but my slight I mean SLIGHT. In day to day life I don't think it will really matter. In my two weeks of using the One as a daily driver I never had a "wow, that was fast" moment, and my Nexus was already plenty fast for me. Extreme power users may notice a bigger difference, but for the common man, an upgrade for speed alone is not worth it. 

* Vibration: The vibration on the Oneplus One sucks. It's tiny (I can't feel it in my pocket), is loud (makes a racket on my desk), and doesn't feel solid (haptic feedback doesn't feel "right" anymore). I love the solid, slow rumble of the Nexus. The vibration motor is actually very fast and powerful - if you grip it in your hand when it vibrates it actually feels very substantial - however, the weight of the phone makes the phone not vibrate enough when it is loose in the world (on a desk, in a loose pocket, etc.). The result is a loud sound as the motor whirs inside but the phone doesn't actually move all the much. They would have done much better to keep the vibration speed slower to actually rock the phone instead of buzzing. 

* Size: I think I have pretty average sized hands, especially when you factor in girl-sized hands. I could just wrap my hands around the Nexus 5 while using my thumb relatively comfortably around the entire screen, and it always felt very secure. The One is absolutely unwieldy to use with one hand. There is no way I can wrap my hand around the phone and use the thumb as well, so I am always cradling the phone in my hand instead of actually gripping it. I was terrified that if anyone bumped into me it would fly out of my hand. Using this thing in New York would be a nightmare.

* Camera: I'm not really a picture guy so I don't think I'm super qualified to talk about this aspect. 

* Audio: I listen to a lot of music and consider myself an audiophile. I used a Havi B3 Pro and a Grado SR325e to make this comparison. The One definitely has a flatter sound signature, but has just slightly more power than the Nexus 5. The B3 Pro is relatively difficult to drive, and usually requires around 80% to 100% power to hear reasonably. The One can comfortably play all files at around 60% to 75% power. However, my Nexus 5 on Cyanogenmod 12 got a huge boost in volume, and can now play files at around the same volume level as the one. As for sound quality, I have to give the Nexus 5 the edge. Using my Grados, I could just hear more details over the entire range with better separation and soundstage. The audio jack on the Nexus 5 also feels more solid than that of the One. It seems to me that the audio module in the One was one place where they cut costs to save. 

* Battery Life: Yeah, the One wins hands down. I'm a pretty moderate user and usually got through the day with more than 60% to 50% left in the tank. My Nexus 5 usually has around 30% with ElementalX kernel. I'm sure you could go two days on a single charge with the One if you thought just a little about saving power. No way could you do that with the Nexus. With custom kernels I'm sure the battery life will only get better. 

WHY I'M RETURNING IT

The size. That's really the only thing that bothers me. The size bothered me for the whole two weeks I was using it. Every time I held it in my hand I was afraid I would drop it. Sitting down meant the phone would dig into my hip - even walking up the stairs I was reminded of the phone in my pocket. I'm always on the go, so I need to use this phone quickly out and about. This phone just wasn't able to give that to me. The only time I really enjoyed using the phone was when i had a few minutes to sit down and browse while waiting for the bus or an appointment - otherwise, the screen size was more of an encumbrance than a benefit. I picked up my broken Nexus 5 after a few days of only using the One and I absolutely loved how it fit into my hand. The benefits of the One just don't make up for having a portable device - which is, after all, what a phone is. To me, the One felt like a tablet with phone functionality than a phone. If the One were a five inch phone with the same dimensions as the Nexus, I would have kept it, no question. 

I purchased a replacement screen for my Nexus and will try my hand at repairing it myself. 

TL;DR: Got the Oneplus One after I shattered my Nexus 5's screen, loved it, but it was just too big for me to use comfortably on the go. Will be returning it and trying to repair my Nexus 5 myself.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If there are no belt loops I would say do not use a belt. It will get out of place and just look bad. 

Additionally the material of the coat and said belt would have to match perfectly for it to look like the belt is meant to be there. Using a cloth belt on a wool coat would look like you just threw the belt on randomly and it will look out of place. I'm going to guess you got a wool overcoat, which means you would need some sort of wool belt. As for color, I think a contrast belt might be cool (black coat, light gray belt) but it absolutely HAS to be the same material. 

I'd say either try to find a belt and then post a fit-pic here or just rock it as is.  </TEXT>

You can't go wrong with [Gloverall](http://www.gloverall.com/), who basically invented the duffle coat.

[Schott](https://www.schottnyc.com/products/satin-lined-duffle-coat.htm?catID=9) also sells some quality duffles. [This](https://www.schottnyc.com/products/short-duffle.htm?catID=9) short option is a nice modern twist on the traditional long coat. 

Since it is a little less formal, I would recommend a less formal color, such as a light gray, olive, or camel.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everyone else's advise is solid. You really need to find a scent that *you* like, and works well with your natural scent. That means going to a store and trying a few. There are multitudes of guides on reddit (one in our very own sidebar!) to get you started on some popular, quality colognes. 

Just a note: you will be damn hard pressed to find a fragrance that lasts 10-12 hours. A good longevity for a summer fragrance is about 4-5 hours, winter fragrance around 7-8. 10-12 is basically unheard of. 

Another note: don't skimp on fragrance. Cheap fragrances will smell cheap and you'd honestly be better off not wear anything. A bottle lasts a long time (more than a year) so spend a little more on a good one.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It definitely doesn't need to be all that close. The usual recommendation is the same shade or a few darker. The goal is to have it look like a shadow. It is normally ill-advised to match the socks to the shoe, especially black-black, since it makes your shoe look like a boot. With a suit, however, I think it's fine. A few shades down from charcoal is black, after all. 

Personally I like to have my socks have a little flair to them, so they are interesting. I have stripes, dots, fair isle, and speckled socks that complement the rest of what I'm wearing. This is only for casual outfits though, definitely would not do this with a suit. 

You should only wear white socks while working out.  </TEXT>

No, the two pieces do not need to have a bit of the same color in each. I'd even go so far to say that you run the risk of looking matchy-matchy if you do that. At the very least they need to be complementary colors.

It's called a button-down because the collar buttons down onto the shirt. All shirts that have buttons on the front are called button-ups. A button-down shirt is also a button up, but a button up shirt is not necessarily a button-down!  

Fabric is the next important. There are many different types of fabrics for a shirt; [here's](http://www.realmenrealstyle.com/dress-shirt-fabrics/) a really in-depth overview on the most common ones. Generally, thinner, finer, "shinier" fabrics are more formal (broadcloth), and thicker, rough-textured fabrics (oxford cloth, twill, flannel) are more casual.  

You say you want a solid shirt, so I'm going to leave patterns out. Generally, though, solid colors and more formal and any sort of pattern is more casual. 

The most common casual collared shirt recommended here is the oxford-cloth button down, or OCBD. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nope, I actually kinda like it. I think it feels nice and soft like a flannel. I have yet to see whether any of my other ones will get fuzzy like this  since I haven't washed any of them yet.  

Mind you I probably would have exchanged it if I had purchased it new. But no it has not stopped me from wearing it.

<TEXT> Standard tapered have significant'y more thigh room than slims. I went with a standard tapered because I normally can't wear slim pants (511 is a sausage-thigh fit) and I normally wear normal tapers but I definitely could have gone with a slim tapered. Think of slim as the standard, skinny as the slim, and standard as the "plus".

I will say the standard still has a nice taper to them. They won't look like dad pants.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You should wear light, pastel colors. 

If you want to really go in depth, check out [this](http://www.wikihow.com/Choose-Colors-That-Flatter-Skin-Tone) guide to determining your skin tone. Once you've found it, search your skin tone + color chart to find a palate of colors that work well with your specific skin tone. 

Note that these aren't set rules! If you find a color that doesn't match your skin tone but you think still looks good on you, rock it! And what color your clothes are relative to you matters very little. What's much more important is your clothes' color relative to each other. 

As for what clothes you should wear, check out the side bar's Getting Started Guide and hang around on this sub. 

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know charcoal colored gets thrown around here a lot but I already have one of those (J. Crew University coat, which I love) and I'm looking to expand my coat selection during the coming end-of-season sales. I am looking for a light, heather gray wool coat.

I love the design and color of [this Zara](http://www.zara.com/us/en/sale/man/coats-and-trench-coats/coats/double-faced-coat-c541817p2161054.html) coat but I have heard bad things about Zara and the quality at this price point. I would rather have something that will last me a while. Is there anything with a similar design? Or should I just go for this one?

I also like the [Schott Car Coat in Heather Gray](https://www.schottnyc.com/products/wool-car-coat.htm) but my size is already sold out. 

The [J. Crew Skiff Jacket](https://www.jcrew.com/AST/Navigation/Sale/AllProducts/PRD~A9716/A9716.jsp?Nbrd=J Nloc=en_US Nrpp=48 Npge=1 Ntrm=skiff isSaleItem=true color_name=CHARCOAL isFromSearch=true isNewSearch=true hash=row0) is also nice but doesn't come in the light gray color I want.

Do you know of any coats that fit my description?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to do the same thing as you when I was first starting out and buying my basic items. Now that I have a good enough wardrobe my shopping experience is a little different. There are a few items that I am looking at purchasing/upgrading to add to my wardrobe (parka, dress shoes) that I am slowly researching and taking my time on purchasing. When I go to stores I take a look at these items but also "impulse buy" anything that I like that is on sale (ie. might not be there when I come back) at stores that have good return policies. I then sit on it for a while and really consider whether I will really use an item or not. Most often I end up returning the item. If what I like is not on sale I'll add it to my list of things to research more. This gives me the "shopping fix" without wasting any money.

I view shopping as more of a journey than a destination spot. I have more than enough basics that I don't have to make trips to buy specific things anymore - instead, I shop to see new clothes that maybe aren't exactly in line with my current style or something I wouldn't necessarily think of wearing. Maybe I will be inspired to try something new. 

A total of zero of my friends care about dressing well, and they view shopping as a chore and only go when they absolutely need something, and try to be in and out as fast as possible. They make fun of me for going every week and coming back with nothing. But I don't care. To me it's an experience that helps me develop my personal style. 

Plus going by myself gets me away from my asshole friends. 

TL;DR: what you're doing is fine and better than what most people do.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pretty sure these items at TJ Maxx and Marshall's are lower quality lines produced specifically for these stores. There are hundreds of these socks in the ones in my city. 

I think the general rule of thumb is if there's a only a few items in a single size it is a mainline, normal quality item (American Eagle and some Levi's washes come to mind); if you see a ton of an item in multiple sizes (pretty much everything else), it's a low quality item. Compare this to [mainline](http://www.divisadero.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ww-socks.jpg) [packaging](http://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/mBPjOCzQo5_zDWe8TIl9H2A.jpg) and you can see a big difference.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think your definition of "punchable" is based on facial features alone. And that's totally okay. 

Here's my take. I think punchability has less to do with the facial features and overall attractiveness and more to do with the attitude that is carried by the person, and therefore the face. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/punchablefaces/comments/2e8b94/this_fucking_twat/) [are](http://www.reddit.com/r/punchablefaces/comments/2kdn6z/i_cant_believe_this_cunt_isnt_the_top_post/) [some](http://www.reddit.com/r/punchablefaces/comments/2atzgu/vine_star_and_little_brat_nash_grier/) [examples] (http://www.reddit.com/r/punchablefaces/comments/2hlmv3/the_doucheness_is_overwhelming/) of people that I think most people would consider attractive; however, the facial expression and attitude they carry make them extremely punchable. The phrase that is thrown around for this kind of effect is "douchey." If the pictures were of them smiling nicely (or just without the smug looks on their faces) they might be less punchable. For instance, I don't think people think [George Clooney](http://www.phootoscelebrities.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/George-Clooney-smile.jpg) has a punchable face even though he is attractive and many people are jealous of his aesthetics. It's because he carries himself with a certain poise that makes him seem likable and kind - definitely not punchable.

I think people with unfortunate facial features sometimes makes them look like they act like a douche or have a smug attitude even though they really don't. The male you linked above is one of those faces for me, as is [this](http://i.imgur.com/YJYSstG.jpg) face. Just something about the nose and the hair makes me want to punch this kid in the face. He's not making any particular facial expression, or acting a certain way, but still, the urge is there. Most people's faces aren't the most attractive or desirable, but I don't go around all day thinking that everyone's face I see is punchable just because their nose is a little big or their eyes a little small. I know plenty of less attractive people that I would never dream of wanting to punch in the face because they are nice and pleasant to be around and look nice and pleasant too. Those girls fall into this category for me - they look pleasant to be around, not punchable. 

I'm sorry you're being downvoted for stating your opinion, OP.

<TEXT> This list misses the two top recommended colognes by this poster: Acqua Di Gio and Armani Code. I have tried both and I really enjoy them. 

Most people think they are really played out, and I agree. I have definitely smelled people using Acqua Di Gio before I even knew what it was. If you go to a more fashionable college that has a lot of bros using it I would steer clear but I go to a nerd school where no one uses cologne so I thought it was a safe bet.

<TEXT> Look up your skin tone online. Generally there are four main skin tones that correspond with the seasons (spring, summer, fall, winter), and a warm/deep and cool variation of each (occasionally a neutral). A quick Google search for determining your skin tone will get you on the right track. 

If you are Asian, I can almost guarantee that you are some variation of Winter. Whether you are warm, cool, or neutral is up to you to determine. 

Each type of skin tone will have a color palate that looks best. Again, a quick Google search of your skin tone + color palate will give you a good indication of which colors will work well for you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This infograph is a two roll cuff, which is very difficult to do, as the fabric that is normally around your forearm is now around your bicep. Try doing it so there's only one roll (don't pull the cuff so high in step two and then skip step three and go to step four). The roll should now be around your elbow/upper forearm, and should be much easier to do.

When I roll up my sleeves I tend to shift the entire shirt over to make the sleeve I'm rolling up longer. Then when I'm finished rolling I recenter my shirt. This way my forearms don't get in the way. Sorry if that doesn't make sense. 

Either way don't sweat it. As long as you roll up your sleeves neatly it will look good any way you do it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just recently got a pair of the heattech gloves and I love them. They are as thin as a pair of those crappy 100% acrylic gloves but they are much warmer. The plus side of them being thin is that you maintain nearly 100% dexterity for things such as fiddling with keys or checking your phone (they are touchscreen compatible). I no longer have to take off my gloves to change the song on my phone! 

If you are out in the cold for a very long time you might want something a little more substantial, but these are so thin that they would probably fit underneath a bigger glove. Definitely worth it. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi everyone!

I have an assignment to interview an entrepreneur for my Intro to Entrepreneurship class. Problem is, I don't know any entrepreneurs personally, so I decided to come here for help! Below is a list of questions that form the guideline for the essay I need to write (copy and pasted directly from my assignment guidelines). 

	Idea selection  individual or team 

	How did the market and customer research effect the decision to launch?

	Describe the process of making the go/no go decision  what other alternatives were under consideration?

	How accurate was the market research?  What changes were required after launch to reorient the business or venture?

	Describe the company culture.  How did the founder set the mold for the enduring culture?  What, if anything, endangered it over time?

	How do they balance time between work, family, and personal pursuits?

	Do they remain as passionate about the product or service as when the company launched?

	Learn about the early business plans.  How useful were they in making decisions?

	Being a CEO/founder is a lonely position.  What steps have they taken to surround themselves with trusted advisors, board members, family, etc.?

	How have they financed the venture?  What lessons can they convey about financing options?

	How actively do they think about selling or exiting the venture?  Why?

Any help would be greatly appreciated! Even just a short summary of your startup or venture would be awesome. 

P.S. I won't be copying down your responses word for word, I need to write an essay based or your responses, so don't worry about that. I have also looked around the IAmAs on the sidebar but the question asked there aren't really focused enough and don't really form enough of a cohesive story for what the professor wants for this assignment.

<TEXT> I think it makes a lot of sense to get a suit of your own right now. There are plenty of situations (applying for an internship, pledging for a frat, dates) that come up frequently enough that it is nice and convenient to have one on hand. 

That being said, I think spending a lot of money on one right now is a waste. It's not going to get a whole lot of use, even in the situations listed above, and your body will most likely still change in college (freshman 15 woooo!). Blowing a lot of money on a suit that will be worn only a handful of times before it doesn't fit anymore sucks. 

My suggestion is to buy one reasonably priced and reasonable quality suit that is extremely versatile. As said previously, there won't be a situation where navy is acceptable but charcoal isn't, and vice versa. The JCP one looks like a great choice, especially if you are patient and wait for a sale. 

I would go with a charcoal suit, but that's just, like, my opinion man.

<TEXT> As someone who also has broad shoulders and thin everything else, I would have some caution with Uniqlo's OCBDs. I found that even their slim fits were too billowy at the waist when I fit the shoulders right. Great quality, but their cut left a lot to be desired. 

I have found that J. Crew OCBDs fit me absolutely perfectly everywhere. If you can afford them, I would definitely consider them if you find that Uniqlo's don't fit you quite right.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> How do I tell a J. Crew Factory OCBD from a regular J. Crew one? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-15 14:45:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have recently gotten into thrifting and frequent a thrift shop that gets a lot of J. Crew OCBDs. 

I have heard of the quality difference between J. Crew and J. Crew Factory, with JCF being of substantially lower quality and fit. Obviously if given the option between the two I would go with regular J. Crew; unfortunately to my untrained eye it's hard for me to tell the difference.

I know about the two diamonds under the tag to indicate factory status, however all the J. Crew tags I see either look like [this](http://i742.photobucket.com/albums/xx66/applky/IMG_2930.jpg) or [this](http://i996.photobucket.com/albums/af86/oboy_oboy/IMG_0530.jpg). I have never seen diamonds on the tags of any of the J. Crew OCBDs I have seen. 

How can I tell the difference just from sight?

I can get the OCBDs at $16.50 to $18.50. Is this a good deal? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Interesting. Uniqlo's sizing charts peg the slim-fit OCBDs at a full 1 inch smaller in body width than the flannels. I have both on the way in size small so we will see I guess. 

*Edit: Just received my Uniqlo flannels. Two of the three flannels I got fit me absolutely beautifully; the third was overly baggy and fit like a drape. All three were in size small so I guess there are variants between the fit. Once my OCBDs come I will compare the fit to the ones that fit me well.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was browsing the J.Crew sale today and I wanted to get a few final sale chinos, but I don't want to mess up the size. After a little researching I came across [this](http://www.styleforum.net/t/181128/slim-fit-chino-j-crew-urban-vs-bb-milano) forum. If you scroll a little down you can see some charts that are supposedly the real measurements for their chinos; however, they don't seem to be right at all. I have a 35" hip and I usually wear size 29 or 30 but according to this chart even the smallest 28 would fall right off me. 

Can anyone who has a pair of J.Crew chinos validate the sizes on this chart? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi!

I am selling my Asus R9 270x, used about half a year. This card has never been used for mining, and has only been slightly overclocked. Still in great condition, only a little dusty since I don't have access to compressed air. Comes with everything I got it with, including the original box, molex adapters, crossfire cable, etc. I could play Battlefield 4 on Ultra settings with this! Asking $110 shipped OBO. 

I am also considering selling my Gigabyte GTX 770 2GB. I have only used this for about a month, never overclocked. I bought it as a present to myself not realizing that the 900 series would be released so soon, and my return window just passed :( I would like it so I can get some money back for a 970, but I am in no rush to sell it. Make me an offer and I will see if I am willing to part ways with it :) I am looking at somewhere in the realm of $225 shipped.

This is my first swap, but I promise I won't scam you! 

Thanks for looking! </TEXT>

<TEXT> My SteelSeries Flux In-Ears went through the wash and I need a new pair of IEMs!

**Budget** - ~$100

**Source** - Primarily phone, I have other full sized headphones for desk use.

**Isolation** - Would be appreciated, though with IEMs it's pretty much a given. 

**Type** - These need to be IEMs. 

**Tonal Balance** - Looking for something more fun? I own a pair of Grado SR325e and I really love how fun they make music sound. 

**Past Headphones** - Too many to list. Serious headphones include Grado SR325e, ATH-M50s, Beyerdynamic DTX 101 iE (though I was very disappointed in the sound of these) and my SteelSeries Flux In-Ears, which were the first IEMs that made me say "wow". 

Looking at Havi B3 Pro-1 and Philips Fidelio S1.

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just wait until you get on campus and go to your first class to purchase any books for that class. Then you will know for sure whether or not you really need the textbook instead of spending a lot of money now on a textbook you won't use at all. You won't be at a disadvantage either since you will probably not use the book at all for the first few weeks anyways, giving you a lot of time to get the right book if you really need it. 

If you MUST get a book now, the textbook that most algebra and calculus classes use is Essential Calculus: Early Transcendentals (Amazon [here](http://www.amazon.com/Essential-Calculus-Transcendentals-James-Stewart/dp/1133112285)). The demand is very high for this book so if you buy it now and find out you don't need it you could sell it to some other freshman very easily. 

Easiest case is just to wait until you really know what book your class uses and if you really need it or not.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd say social life is really depended on each individual. If you want to have fun and be around people, then you will find people that want the same. If you just like to work, then you can do that. 

The social scene is definitely here, and if you want to be a part of it then you can. You will do a fair share of work here but most people take it in stride and have great social lives in addition to the work they do. 

Hope that answered your question.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Congratulations on getting in! Carnegie Mellon is a great school, and I'm sure you will have a great and fulfilling time here should you choose to come. 

To answer your questions:

The professors here are extremely receptive to undergraduate research. Really all you need to do is ask. I knew quite a few people my freshman year who did some really cool research projects, including building and programming a small boat that could guide itself across a pond and someone who was programming the software for a missile defense system. Really neat stuff, and all you need to do is ask. 

Professors in different departments tend not to share too many different classes, but as an ECE/CS student you will be taking classing in pretty much all of the colleges. 

You have the option of transferring from ECE to CS if you want to, and many people try to. However, you should keep in mind that the CS department is extremely selective and admittance rates, even from internal transfers, are extremely low. If you want to transfer to CS, I'd advise you talk to your adviser ASAP to get that process underway. 

The language program here is really great! I take Mandarin, and know many people taking Japanese. We have really great professors, small classes for a really personal experience (my Mandarin class has 7 people in it right now) and a great curriculum that really helps you learn the language. There are many options for study abroad over the summer and they offer many scholarships so you don't even have to pay. 

Again, congrats on getting accepted. If you have anymore questions feel free to reply or PM me.  </TEXT>

I then proceeded to take the beeper out of his car and hide it in other places for a week or two at a time: in his fridge, in his desk, in his backpack. He thought he was going crazy.

I started feeling really bad for him because it was really consuming his life, so I took it and didn't hide it anymore. 

But if he ever does anything to annoy me... </TEXT>

<TITLE> UPDATE to my story, would like more help. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-25 17:42:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1uts8o/19m_my_long_distance_girlfriend_19f_was_diagnosed/) a little while ago asking for help. I have some updates to that story and I would like to hear your opinions on what I should do. 

I waited a few weeks after my first post and I sent her a card that generally said I'm sorry for what I did, I will give you space if you want space, but I am here for you if you want me to be here. It was a very kind card (at least I think so): I didn't make any implications that she should reply or anything like that, it was very neutral and she could have done whatever she wanted with it. 

She then posts on her Tumblr a few things. First, she posts this: 


 "Im tired of this. I have already made it very clear how I feel. The rest I dont think I have any obligation to explain. I am done caring."


She then deletes it maybe an hour later (I was checking it pretty obsessively) and posts this:


"There is really nothing I have to say to you, because every time I do try to think of something to say, all that comes to me are words of anger. Thats not something Id like to do, unless maybe it is really necessary for you to understand. So now the only thing I have to say is that I think the best thing to do now is just to let go and move on. I have made my peace and I will let go of whatever anger there is remaining. I have no regrets, no blame, no guilt, and no will to even try to explain anymore. I would like to move on without even the tiniest things holding me back.
Though I guess I do have one more thing. Saturday did not hurt me as much as you might think it did. So let go of whatever guilt you say you have. There is no reason to hold onto it anymore.

I get pretty angry and start to vent things on my Tumblr, which I thought she didn't know about. I said some very mean, untrue things. I was just so angry and I was writing down whatever came to my mind. 

Turns out she DID know about my Tumblr and read everything. She sends me a very angry email saying things like "obviously I was too nice, and you're taking advantage of that, you don't say these things to people to make you feel better about yourself." She legitimately thought that I wrote it in the intent that I wanted her to read it. 

Her friends messages me too, doing general "you're spewing nonsense, you obviously don't know my friend, grow up and leave her alone you don't deserve her". 

I send her friend a message explaining that I didn't know she knew about my Tumblr and that I never intended for her to read what I wrote, and that I would leave them alone. She sends a message back thanking me and saying that what I've said means a lot (not sarcastically, I think she really meant it). 

Sorry for another wall of text. I don't really like leaving anything out. 

My question now is, do you think that I should wait this out and see what happens, or do you think the situation is wrecked and I should move on? She obviously did not want to repair this even before she read what I wrote, but I know that it hasn't even been that much time since our initial argument. I know everyone said to wait a few months, but I knew I would feel like shit until I did something proactive. 

Thanks so much for all your help.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A previous post here linked [this](http://livingmanicdepressive.com/2012/08/21/relationship-falling-apart/) article. 

What do you guys think of it? Does it have any merit? 

If any of you are wondering I'm already in the "past break-up" stage and she says that she doesn't want to be with someone who is acting so selfishly (when she came to me and asked me for some time to myself I was kind of pushy and tried to talk her out of it). It's a long story and if you really want to hear it I can tell you guys.

<TEXT> Before I went to college I used to look down at my keyboard every few letters for whatever reason. Just typing a lot of essays helped me learn to touch type. It wasn't even a conscious decision to learn, it kind of just happened.

My advice is to just type a lot. If you really want to stop looking at your hands tape a piece of paper over the keyboard at the top and type with your hands under it so you can't see your hands or the keys. Alternatively, if you're truly desperate, get a keyboard with no legends. That will definitely make you learn.  </TEXT>

Obviously right now I've hurt her so much that any advance I make in the near future probably won't be received well. I think it's to the point where if she saw an email from me she would delete it right away or if she got a letter she would instantly throw it away. So attempting to contact her now is out of the question.
I feel like now I just need to remind her that I am still here. My mom thinks it's a good idea to send her something ever one in a while, like a small thing of chocolates or something like it, addressed from me so she knows that I sent it but with no other text. I think this is an okay idea. What do you think?

I still really want to apologize to her for what I did, but again, I don't think she's in the mindset to receive it. The second to last message she sent me was "This is so upsetting you need to stop this I don't want to hear it". Do you think it's a good idea for me to try to apologize, and how would I go about doing that? </TEXT>

**BACKSTORY**

Im a sophomore in college and go to a university on the East Coast. Last summer when I was back for summer break I met what I think is the girl of my dreams. We both have our homes in the same city on the West Coast. If you asked me why I love her, I couldnt give you a definitive answer. But I know that I am the happiest when I am around her and I love her more than anyone I have ever known.

I met her only two weeks before I had to go back to college, so I tried to make the most of it. I was with her almost every day and I had the time of my life with her. When the two weeks were up I knew that I wanted to have a relationship with this girl and I wanted to ask her out in person and not wait, so I asked her out, and she said yes, and we both left on great terms.

Throughout the semester we keep in contact and talking almost every day, Skypeing and messaging each other and what not. It is during this time that I learned that she has pretty big family issues that were left unresolved when they happened (her parents got divorced and I dont think she ever learned to properly handle it, and she still has big issues with her father to this day). I was able to relate to her, since I too have had problems with my parents, and I put it in my mind that this is something to think about and maybe help her in the future.

Winter break comes and Im so excited to see her. Unfortunately, she had planned a trip to her home country Taiwan that would take up almost the entire break. So I see her twice before she left, two of the best nights of my life, and she left. We still kept in contact but it was difficult due to the time difference. We sent emails to each other every day but we talked about very serious topics. In her last email to me she made a comment saying that she thought it might not have been a good idea to enter into a relationship so quickly.

**THE MAIN PART**

She comes back from her trip and she tells me that she has time for one last visit with her. So I meet her and I can tell pretty much right away that something is wrong.

She tells me that late last semester she was diagnosed with depression and that her father is abusive (her words, not mine). And she tells me that she needs time to sort things out by herself. I ask her what she means by needing time and she says that she cant handle a relationship right now and that she doesnt want me to contact her or talk to her.

I preface this next part by saying at that point I had no clue about how to talk to someone or help someone with depression. I know now that what I did was completely and utterly wrong and hurt her more than I can imagine. But back to the story.

Naturally I do not like what she is telling me. I felt terrible that the person I loved was diagnosed with depression and felt so hurt by the fact that she didnt want to keep in contact with me and talk to me. Again, this is before I knew that people with depression push the people they love away. So I told her that I dont think I can do that, especially now that I know that youre sick, and that I want to be there for her and help her overcome her depression. And she kept saying no, that she needs time, which is something someone with depressions would do. I got so frustrated and angry that she didnt want me that I stormed out on her. I know. Bad call.

I sent her a text that night saying I was sorry for leaving the way I did and that I am there for her whenever she needs me. She sends a text back saying shes sorry too and that hopefully were both a lot happier when we see each other again.

The next day I wrote and sent her a physical letter saying basically that I dont expect a response, Im sorry for being an ass and that if you say you need time, you need time, Im scared that you will forget about me, I love you and I will miss you, please dont forget about me. I also said that I dont think you have to do it this way and that it hurts me that you are doing this to me. I know, I know, the absolute wrong thing to say.

Wednesday she gets my letter and immediately sends me an email. Here is the most relevant bit.


"When we talked, what I really needed was your support, your patience, your understanding, and your respect. And I feel that I didnt get any of that. I had hoped that you would understand, but now I feel like you havent even tried. I didnt do this to hurt you. In part I was trying to protect you, but I was also trying to protect myself, something I need to do. How could you think that this is something that Ive done to you? I dont blame you for anything. But I honestly cannot understand how selfish and immature you are acting. You say that you care, but right now you are hurting me rather than helping me. I cannot be with someone who acts this way. I see very clearly now that we cant be in a relationship. This is not how love works.

I have only one request. Please do not make this even more difficult for me. Please just leave me alone. Youll get better and youll move on and live your life. You will.

I wont forget the memories we made because they were good memories, but now its time to move on. I really do wish the best for you.


Naturally, I go ballistic. I called her, left her a pathetic voicemail, emailed her back three times, recorded a pathetic video and sent it to her, and messaged her on Facebook. In short, I didnt do what she wanted.

She unfriends me from Facebook and I ask to her to not unfriend me. Im trying to talk to her, saying things like Youre right. I dont understand, but I cant if you do this. Please help me understand, I want to be here for you. It gets so bad that she messages me, in all caps, JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

And so I stop. And thats the last interaction Ive had with her.

**WHAT I THINK NOW**

From what Ive read online, and looking back at what I did, I did the exact opposite of what she needed me to do. She needed me to understand, but I was too blinded by wanted to keep this relationship that I wouldnt listen to her until she had to scream it over Facebook. She did what people with depression do, and I didnt see that and tried to talk her out of it and blame her, which is the absolute opposite of what she needed. I know what I did hurt her so much.

At this point, Im not concerned with getting back together with her. At this point I just want her to be better. From what Ive heard her depression is severe to the point where it is hurting her physical well being in that she can barely make it through a day without almost collapsing. And friends that are complete strangers to her have seen her on campus have told me that she looks miserable and that theres something wrong, even though I hadnt told them anything about this. She doesnt have very many close friends, and she hasnt told her parents about her depression because partly, theyre the cause. Im pretty sure I am one of the very few (or maybe the ONLY) person she has trusted this information with.

I know she cares about me or she wouldnt be acting this way. But Im not concerned with that right now. All I want is to be a good person and help her in any way I can. I still care so much about her, but my goal is not to get her back. My only goal is to help her get better. My question is how do I do that?

Thanks for reading my incredibly long post, and thanks for the help you give. I will be here on my computer all day so if you have any more questions just ask and I will respond quickly.

A note: she has said the she has been visiting a therapist, so she is getting help professionally. Im asking what I can do personally to help her.

**TL;DR** My girlfriend was diagnosed with depression that is severe to the point of it harming her physically. She told me she needed time to figure things out herself but I wouldnt let her do that and I pushed her so hard she broke up with me. She needed my support and I didnt give it to her. Right now, I am not interested in getting her back. Just as a friend, what do I do now to help her in any way? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The keyboard the keyboard the keyboard. The keyboard will be a HUGE step up from a simple microsoft membrane. Besides, you already have a headset you like, that upgrade won't be nearly as impressive as the jump to mechanical. 

As for your worries about mechanical keyboards:

* Don't worry about it disturbing you when you play. It won't, besides you use a headset so you'll barely be able to hear it. 
* Don't worry about you not liking it. Unless you are in a VERY small minority, you will absolutely love it and you will wonder how you ever typed without one. 

You can always return it if you REALLY don't like it. Go for the keyboard. You won't regret it.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I totally agree. Intel does offer more performance but bang-for-buck AMD is much better. As a college student on a budget that's what I went with. I have my 6300 OC'd to 4.7 GHz and it performs very well; at this point the only CPU I'd upgrade to is an i7-4770k, which would require a new mobo and quite a bit more money.

<TEXT> I think people SEVERELY underestimate the value of the touch covers. Here's why:

* Absolutely NO moving parts/greater durability. This is so much better for travel or general "beater" use as there are fewer things to break or get caught in. 

* Greater spill resistance. Spilling liquids on a Type Cover would require a lot more recovery than with a Touch Cover. Unless you've managed to soak it all the way through, a simple wipe-down with a paper towel is all you need to clean a simple Touch Cover spill. 

* Thinner. I know at this point we're talking millimeters of difference but the Touch Covers (especially Touch Cover 2) just feel so much lighter. 

Unless you do a LOT of typing (I'm talking multi-page essays or university assignments), the Touch Cover will be FAR more useful. A thin lightweight cover for your Surface that's good enough for banging out a few emails or urls when needed. 

To directly answer your concern, you can just tap the trackpad anywhere to register a left click and tap with two fingers to register a right click. No need to ever use those dinky buttons below the trackpad.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love the Surface as much as anyone in the subreddit but I gotta say that ultrabook looks top notch... I would honestly go with that. The slightly better resolution and screen size does it for me. 

I have a Surface RT but I still prefer the traditional laptop/ultrabook build for a primary portable work computer. Sure I know it's basically the same thing with a type cover but the 10.6 inch screen is a *little* too small for heavy working for my taste.  </TEXT>

Having said that, though, I recommend:

* Razer Black Widow Ultimate 2013 Edition Keyboard (BF4 edition if you really want it, but I like the clean Razer green)

* Razer Mamba Mouse. (this is the category where you should REALLY look around yourself, they have TONS of awesome mice.)

* Razer Kraken 7.1 Headset. 

Again, just take a look and see what really suits you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's time to look into the pros and cons of using each product in real life rather than just the pros and cons of the computers themselves. If you're gonna be bringing it to class, the Alienware is going to be WAY too huge. I'd go with the blade. In my experience with college, portability and battery life are just SO incredibly important. If you do get the Alienware I would look into also getting a companion tablet or light netbook for you to bring to class with the money you save. They're both great computers that serve slightly different purposes (powerful all around computer vs. desktop replacement). Make your call while considering your lifestyle (do you plan on sitting in your room or going to the library to do work, lan parties with friends, etc.) and how you plan on using your computer (take it to class or leave it in your room). 

Also, technically it's not their first PC, as they have the Razer Blade Pro that was released a few years ago.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This keyboard is AMAZING, much better than any membrane or chiclet keyboard in my opinion. The only downside is it's VERY loud, really clacky especially if you type fast (of courss, this could be seen as an upside to most people). If you have roommates or if you think you'll be bothered by the sound I'd recommend asking for the Steath version which uses different switches to be quieter. Personally, it doesn't bother me or my roommate and I kinda like the sound it makes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From what I've heard the Surface 2 is only a few hundredths of an inch thinner than the Surface RT, so thinness isn't really that big of a difference. Apparently the weight difference is quite nice, though I haven't had any problems with the weight of my RT. I got my 64 GB RT for $200 and I feel no incentive to upgrade to the 2 except for the better screen. I think $250-$200 is the perfect price point for the Surface RT </TEXT>

<TEXT> Realistically, what do you use NFC for? And why is it so important that if it doesn't have it it's a deal breaker?

Not bashing, just curious. I think NFC is a great tool but I haven't found any practical applications of it that would make it a deciding factor in purchasing a tablet or phone.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> MathXL puts the CORRECT answer in the box after you get it wrong, so the answer in the blue box is NOT what you input.

<TEXT> There was an incident that happened during Orientation Week at my school... it is now known as the "Brown Leg Incident."

During the first night of school a guy invited a girl to his room, and they began to get down and dirty. His roommate was trying to sleep on the top bunk and got so fed up that he left to sleep in the lounge. One of the RA's walked by and asked him what was going on, and together they went to investigate the room. 

While the two lovebirds were alone they had switched to anal sex, and were going at it full force when his roommate opened the door. The shock from the door opening and the ongoing sex caused her to unleash her bowels in full force all over the guy's leg, and due to crappy school food it was runny and full-on disgusting. We all ran out of our rooms from the sound and saw the couple covered in shit and fully embarrassed. 

Both students switched dorms after that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pikachu main, here. I use the c-stick for quick down smashes (roll + down smash is king). Whenever I want to charge a smash I use direction + A.

I'd say it's more personal preference than anything, I know some great players who don't use the c-stick at all. I have found, though, that all the insane players I know ALL use the c-stick. So it would seem that it is your friends that are the noobs and you that are the pro. 

C-stick is also invaluable for directional air attacks. Pikachu's are amazing, so I use the c-stick A LOT for that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I live in Donner, which is really nice, coed by wing (west and east), largest rooms for a double, walls are pretty thick here. Apparently Stever is considered one of the worst freshman dorms so if you liked it you should be fine anywhere. Morewood has the smallest rooms though, almost tiny compared to mine. 

The internet here is AMAZING, I get ~13 mbps download speed on WIFI which in my opinion is incredible. Yes, sometimes it cuts out randomly for like half a minute but it's infrequent enough that it's not a nuisance. Ethernet is the most stable, never ever had it cut out but I get slower download speeds ~10 mbps. You have a 50 Gb download limit for 5 days but you will never EVER go over it, I download large files constantly and have no problem (I once redownloaded my entire steam library and was fine). There are gaming clubs, not sure if for CS:GO but I'm sure you could form one easily.  </TEXT>
