<TEXT> Stumbled across this thanks to someone on twitter. Looks like some black magic shit. Honestly has no idea. I recently found a youtube channel related to a name that's tied to the website. Their only video can be found [here(WARNING LOUD SOUNDS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SM90-L2g0tc). Its quite disturbing honestly. I also searched the website to find that same image. It was titled "Help me". In the archive of the website there seems to be a video capture that was deleted. I havent found a way to access it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well it's not impossible some aren't prerecorded. I'm not positive about fnaf 2  but I think fnaf 1 is the only game that directly states they're pre recorded. And you not replying to them doesn't necessarily mean they're not talking to you live since in fnaf 3 the "Phone Dude" calls obviously aren't prerecorded since springtrap isn't present on night 1 of fnaf3. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was wondering if I needed my serial code on the back of my 3ds to still trade it in. After a long time it came off of course. I remember trying to trade in my old DS lite before and gamestop didn't let me because the serial code was gone. I was also wondering how much money is knocked off if you don't turn it in with the charger. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I believe the toys didn't free them, just brought them together. When purple guy is killed they finally get their revenge and are freed. I also think the original child (The Puppet) was killed in fredbear's which is probably why they were so quick to sell to Fazbear Entertainment. That's just what I think though. We'll probably never know all the answers to the story, we just have to work with what we have. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We all know that Golden Freddy Appears in the fnaf3 stage01 minigame since you play as him. The file dump for fnaf3 was recently released with the sound files and textures. While looking through the textures i found this guy (its #290 if you want to look for yourself) So, where do you guys think he is. Its transparent so he probably belongs somewhere unless scott removed him. Anyone seen him yet? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can relate. I have both versions of the game and doing the custom night challenges on pc are so much easier because of this. On the mobile port golden Freddy just kills you no matter what and I've sorta stopped attempting the rest of the custom night challenges because of this. Hopefully scott fixes this after fnaf 3 comes out. </TEXT>
