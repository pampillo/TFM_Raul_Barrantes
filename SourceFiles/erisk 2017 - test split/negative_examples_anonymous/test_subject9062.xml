<TEXT> It's the NRA astroturfers. In reality, the majority of America is tired of the gun terrorism and the blood spilled every day. Not sure how much of it is covered in international press. It's abhorrent. Six toddlers this week were killed in America by guns. 
From Women Against Gun Violence's facebook page:
6th TODDLER SHOT THIS WEEK: A 3-year-old boy is in critical condition after shooting himself in the head with his grandfather's gun. The loaded gun had been left on the nightstand next to the bed where the toddler was napping. This is the sixth child, 4 and under, to be shot this week. http://ow.ly/PeMUA </TEXT>

<TEXT> George C. Deutsch
Deutsch, who worked on Bush's reelection campaign, was appointed to NASA's press office. A creationist, Deutsch attempted to have the word "theory" added to every instance of the phrase "Big Bang" on NASA's website. He also allegedly kept the press from talking to Dr. James Hansen, an expert on global warming. He was released from his position in 2006 after blogger Nick Anthis discovered that Deutsch had lied on his rsum and had never actually graduated college. He later claimed that the only reason his appointment was controversial was because he was a Christian.


Oh fuck. I'm going to throw up.

Investigators are asking for the public's help in locating a 1970s full-size, single-cab Chevrolet or GMC pickup truck that is a faded single-orange color with black primer on the driver's side body. The pickup also has a full-size bed and round headlights.

Residents should pay special attention to the rendering's distinctive headlights, Larimer County Sheriff's Office spokesman David Moore said in a media briefing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dad gifted him a gun after he'd recently been arrested. Hoping to see charges against the father for that. I had a similar thought - could picture this full-on KKK picnic in the back country celebrating this shit. Seriously, I watched this PBS special [Klansville USA](http://video.pbs.org/video/2365401775/) recently that had the most appalling footage. I know the history, but seeing it is another level of nauseating.

<TEXT> For a minute I thought today was Juneteenth. 

[Juneteenth is the oldest known celebration commemorating the ending of slavery in the United States.  Dating back to 1865, it was on June 19th that the Union soldiers, led by Major General Gordon Granger, landed at Galveston, Texas with news that the war had ended and that the enslaved were now free. Note that this was two and a half years after President Lincolns Emancipation Proclamation - which had become official January 1, 1863. The Emancipation Proclamation had little impact on the Texans due to the minimal number of Union troops to enforce the new Executive Order. However, with the surrender of General Lee in April of 1865, and the arrival of General Grangers regiment, the forces were finally strong enough to influence and overcome the resistance.](http://www.juneteenth.com/history.htm) </TEXT>

Sanders was an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and participated in the historic March on Washington in 1963 as a 22-year-old student at the University of Chicago. "It was a question for me of just basic justice  the fact that it was not acceptable in America at that point that you had large numbers of African-Americans who couldn't vote, who couldn't eat in a restaurant, whose kids were going to segregated schools, who couldn't get hotel accommodations living in segregated housing," he told the Burlington Free Press.

Got on the plane, took off, and the stewardesses were serving drinks. A woman one row up got coffee. The stewardess spilled the coffee on the woman's baby, who immediately began shrieking. Meanwhile my kid had just fallen asleep, double concern for the burned baby and now my kid, who might actually SLEEP through a plane ride, is going to wake up screaming too. They asked whether anyone on the plane was a doctor and the nintendo t-shirt guy was a pediatrician.

<TEXT> During a routine inspection of Stag Arm's facilities in August, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms   Explosives found a large cache of receivers  the part of the gun that houses the trigger and firing mechanism  without serial numbers, which is a violation of the National Firearms Act.

Stag Arms is owned by Mark Malkowski, who was a vocal advocate for the gunmaking industry when the state legislature and Gov. Dannel P. Malloy sought to pass tougher gun control laws in the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting. Stag manufactures guns out of two buildings on John Downey Drive in New Britain. The facilities are co-located with another gunmaker, Continental Machine Tool (CMT), which is owned by Malkowski's father, Tadeusz Malkowski. </TEXT>

According to court records, Hernandez was in another room of the apartment practicing form in front of the mirror and the gun  accidentally went off and went through the mirror and the wall and fatally injured the daughter, his attorney reported.

...

Hernandez and the girls mother, Cynthia Votta, had been in and out of child custody court since 2011, according to court records. Hernandez was awarded sole custody in 2013 after Votta moved out of the home without the children, court documents indicated. In September, a circuit court judge ratified Hernandezs award of custody. </TEXT>

No other developed nation has this kind of crazy gun violence taking out citizens on the daily and yet not a peep from those in charge of keeping the safety. I didn't hear any politicians comment on this at all; not one mention.

<TEXT> News reports have said that James Holmes bought his arsenal legally. But did he really? The mentally ill arent supposed to own guns, and is there anyone who thinks this guy wasnt wrong in the head? He supposedly was odd enough to creep out a Colorado gun range owner.

A report last year from the advocacy group Mayors Against Illegal Guns found that states arent doing enough to stop the mentally ill from getting firearms. After the Gabrielle Giffords shooting, the Wall Street Journal reported that the bar for banning someone from owning a gun is awfully high.

Ill say the same thing I thought after Seung Hui Cho went on his murderous rampage at Virginia Tech: How about requiring a co-signer for your gun license? This could be a family member, a friend, a co-worker, anyone who could swear he knew no reason you shouldnt have a gun.

The report states that the younger Pittman, who was 28 and the father of two young children, shot himself in Morrow Mountain State Park in Stanly County, in full view of visitors, following a domestic dispute.


Rep. Pittman has championed expanding gun owner rights in the General Assembly and during his campaigns for the District 82 House seat. 


Pittman is the primary sponsor of a bill filed Tuesdaythe day after his sons suicidethat would prohibit any local government employees from enforcing federal firearms laws, unless by court order. The bill, titled the Gun Rights and Privacy Act, would also repeal local prohibitions against carrying concealed weapons, and would streamline the handgun permit while traveling across state lines and to make the purchase of a firearm more efficient.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is the clash of very-recent history and today in the US; there are now two generations born after the civil rights fights where people were killed for trying to gain voting rights, where government officials presided over brutal treatment of blacks - obviously not to say it's "fixed", but it isn't what it was. So the term is a clusterfuck because the history of race in America is. 
But even with these reminiscences, those times have the feel of distant history, of dusty newsreels and faded photographs. So the programs central focus is on what it calls the last lynching in the United States: the murder of Michael A. Donald, 19, by two young Ku Klux Klansmen in Mobile, Ala., in 1981. Or as Representative Artur Davis of Alabama, the third delegate Mr. Koppel spends time with, says, in the era of color TV.


James Knowles, one of the murderers, says on the program that he and his confederate, Henry Hays, the son of the local Klan chief, had randomly selected Mr. Donald as he was walking down a street one night. The two kidnapped him at gunpoint, then drove to a wooded area where they beat him and slit his throat. They returned to hang the body from a tree within view of the Hays family home.


The case became a landmark, though; after the men were convicted, Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center brought a federal civil suit on behalf of Beulah Mae Donald, the victims mother, connecting the murder to the Klan as an organization. In 1987 the jury returned a $7 million wrongful-death judgment, bankrupting the local chapter.

<TEXT> This same misogyny and harassment can also be seen with the Gunsense hashtag -- a hashtag used by gun safety advocates and Shannon Watts from Moms Demand -- a grassroots organization working for gun sense in our country. This hashtag is trolled regularly by pro-gun, NRA types which results in shameless comments. Shannon's tweets and Moms Demand tweets are also trolled non-stop.

As a matter of fact, if you say anything pro-gun safety you will be trolled -- hashtag or not -- by a legion of trolls. I have personally been the victim of that many times. But by far, nobody gets it worse than Shannon Watts of Moms Demand, and her organization. Check out her timeline on Twitter any time and you will see what I mean.

<TEXT> The first time that I was posted to Washington, DC some years ago, the capital and suburbs endured a frightening few days at the hands of a pair of snipers, who took to killing people at random from a shooting position they had established in the boot of a car. I remember meeting a couple of White House correspondents from American papers, and hearing one say: but the strange thing is that Maryland (where most of the killings were taking place) has really strict gun laws. And I remember thinking: from the British perspective, those arent strict gun laws. Strict laws involve having no guns.


After a couple of horrible mass shootings in Britain, handguns and automatic weapons have been effectively banned. It is possible to own shotguns, and rifles if you can demonstrate to the police that you have a good reason to own one, such as target shooting at a gun club, or deer stalking, say. The firearms-ownership rules are onerous, involving hours of paperwork. You must provide a referee who has to answer nosy questions about the applicant's mental state, home life (including family or domestic tensions) and their attitude towards guns. In addition to criminal-record checks, the police talk to applicants family doctors and ask about any histories of alcohol or drug abuse or personality disorders.


Vitally, it is also very hard to get hold of ammunition. Just before leaving Britain in the summer, I had lunch with a member of parliament whose constituency is plagued with gang violence and drug gangs. She told me of a shooting, and how it had not led to a death, because the gang had had to make its own bullets, which did not work well, and how this was very common, according to her local police commander. Even hardened criminals willing to pay for a handgun in Britain are often getting only an illegally modified starters pistol turned into a single-shot weapon.


And, to be crude, having few guns does mean that few people get shot. In 2008-2009, there were 39 fatal injuries from crimes involving firearms in England and Wales, with a population about one sixth the size of Americas. In America, there were 12,000 gun-related homicides in 2008. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A man who declined to be identified told a Reuters photographer that a teenaged girl in a nightgown came to his house, running barefoot through a snowy wooded area and crying that her parents had been shot. They called police and law enforcement officials found her parents dead at their home.

Authorities said they later discovered five other people dead and a wounded woman in three other houses. The woman, who is expected to recover, gave them information about the shooter, Texas County Sheriff James Sigman said.

Four of the victims were identified as Garold Aldridge, 52, his wife Julie Aldridge, 47, Harold Aldridge, 50, and his wife Janell Aldridge, 48.

Authorities would not identify the other victims, but the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that they were Carey Shriver and his wife Valirea Shriver, and Carey's father Darrell Shriver. Darrell's wife Martha was wounded but survived, the paper said. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Worried that the fighting might escalate further and knowing that guns and ammunition were around the house, the 14-year-old started gathering what she could find to hide it.

"(The girl) said all the guns were in easily accessible places," the complaint said. "(She) said that, fearing one of her parents would pick up a gun and use it against the other, she tried to grab all the guns and ammunition. (She) said she put the guns/ammunition she could gather into her bedroom, to get them away from her parents."

Police searched the home and found five guns that belonged to Wright, according to the complaint. A Mossberg 500 12-gauge shotgun and a Smith   Wesson AR 5 rifle were in a child's room.

<TEXT> This is one of the weakest arguments I've heard. It makes no sense. The fact that there are drunk drivers has never been used as an argument to do away with laws against driving under the influence. The fact that people rape is not a case for making rape legal. What about domestic abuse? Fact is, people will abuse their spouses. Criminals don't follow laws. Should we make it legal to punch your wife in the mouth because, shoot, people are gunna do it anyway? 

When I encounter someone using this type of "reasoning", all I learn about them is that they've never been intellectually challenged and likely have no idea what debate team was in high school.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Much of America agrees with you. However we have a broken electoral system and a gridlocked system of center-right democrats and fourth-reich republicans. The NRA owns the republicans and many of the democrats too; the fact that we allow unregulated and unreported and virtually unrestricted financial lobbying and donating to the electoral system by groups like the NRA means that our votes, our letters, our protests are being virtually ignored. Follow groups like 

http://momsdemandaction.org/

http://www.bradycampaign.org/

http://www.parentsagainstgunviolence.com/

and many more to see how many Americans are truly working to change this. I'm sure our country looks crazy as fuck from the outside but many of us just want to know we can send our children to kindergarten and get them back alive with no bullet holes. And personally as a mom, I don't feel that way at ALL. My own parents are older and they discuss our entire family leaving the US. It's absurd.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Vetri Ferman said the victims were Nicole Hill, Stone's ex-wife; Patricia Flick, Hill's sister; Flick's husband, Aaron; the Flicks' 14-year-old daughter, and Hill's mother and grandmother.

...

Another neighbor, Ashley Deane, heard the same noises, likening them to a car or truck hitting a house.

She said she heard what sounded like four gunshots and could hear children screaming for their mother.

Deane said she could hear Stone telling the children that they had to leave. She said she looked out the front window and could see him with the children, who were in their pajamas.

Deane said Stone looked at her and said, "She's hurt," referring to his ex-wife. Stone and the children got in a car and sped off.

This kind of shit should not be happening to children. 
From another article, 
["They've been fighting for years, real bad," a neighbor, Michele Brewster, told the Allentown Morning Call. "He's been tormenting her. She's gone to the police, and she has told everybody, 'He's going to kill me.'''](http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-pennsylvania-manhunt-20141216-story.html)

It will be interesting to see the fallout from this case, to learn how someone with a record of threatening to kill his ex-wife and mother of his daughters was able to access a firearm. Accountability.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Between January 2009 and July 2014, there were at least 110 mass shootings in the U.S. Not all of them make headlinesand the story the data tells is different from the one that mass media would have you expect.**

Using FBI data and media reports, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of every identifiable mass shooting between January 2009 - July 2014. There were at least 110 mass shootings.

**The Washington gun lobby claims that areas where gun-carrying is restricted - gun-free zones - cause mass violence rather than reduce it.**

Our analysis show this is not the case: an overwhelming majority of mass shootings take place in private homes where gun carrying is unrestricted, and less than one in six incidents took place in a so-called gun-free zone.

**Perpetrators of mass shootings are not the people you expect.**
The press often focuses on the mental health of the shooters, but our analysis shows that only 10% of perpetrators exhibited signs of mental illness that were reported to a doctor or other authority figure prior to the incident.

**Perpetrators of mass shootings are generally older than perpetrators of gun violence in the U.S. as a whole.**

Whereas FBI data shows that the median age of gun murderers in the U.S. is 26, the median age of perpetrators of mass shootings was 34.

**Domestic violence is a factor in the majority of mass shootings.**

In 57% of incidents, the shooter killed a current or former partner or family member.

**51% of mass shooting victims are women.**

In contrast to gun violence generally, perpetrators of mass shootings disproportionately target women. Whereas only 15% of total gun homicide victims are women, 51% of mass shooting victims are women.

**High-capacity magazines put the mass in mass shooting.**

When perpetrators used high-capacity magazines or assault weapons likely equipped with them, they shot 159% more people resulting in 65% more deaths.

<TEXT> An analysis of mass shootings, defined as those in which at least four people were killed with a gun, conducted from January 2009 to July 2014 by the gun-control group Everytown for Gun Safety found that of 110 mass shootings, at least 63 of the cases, 57 percent, were related to family or domestic violence. In at least 20 incidents, the shooter had a prior domestic violence charge.

Dee Price Childers, a volunteer with the West Virginia Chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, a division of Everytown for Gun Safety, released a statement on the Monongalia shootings. Our hearts go out to the families of the victims of yesterdays mass shooting in Monongalia County, she said.

This terrible tragedy is yet another reminder of just how easy it is for convicted felons to get their hands on deadly weapons thanks to background check loopholes in federal and state law  and just how often domestic violence turns into deadly gun violence.

<TEXT> * Recognizing the role that assault weapons and high capacity ammunition magazines played, the authors said Lanza's easy access to them "cannot be ignored as a critical factor in this tragedy." The ready availability of assault weapons in the U.S. is an important public health issue, they said.
* Lanza's "severe and deteriorating internalized mental health problems" were combined with a preoccupation with violence. With access to deadly weapons, this "proved a recipe for mass murder," the report concludes.
* The report questions whether Lanza's race and privileged socio-economic status impacted how he was treated. "Is the community more reluctant to intervene and more likely to provide deference to the parental judgment and decision-making of white, affluent parents than those caregivers who are poor or minority?" the report asks.

The gunners in the US are killing this amendment by defending the current abysmal regulations situation; if, after a child is murdered in a massacre with a gun at school, the NRA folks came out with humanity and attempted to fix the loopholes and prevent such tragedies, I think people (me included) would relax .

<TEXT> MUSKEGON TOWNSHIP, MI --  The 27-year-old Muskegon Township man who was nearly naked and reportedly high on acid when he allegedly discharged his gun outside a pizza business on Saturday, with three kids in tow, has been arraigned on four misdemeanor charges.

...


Engle had three children with him  ages 6, 4 and 3  when police said he stood outside the pizza business wearing only a towel and pounding on the glass windows of the business until one shattered. His .40 caliber semi-automatic handgun went off in the process, damaging the casing on the business door. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember the anti-poverty campaigns of the 70's and early 80's. And it seems our poverty problem is much worse this time around - it's going to take a massive shift in the perception of public opinion. But I'd argue the true public opinion is to help thy neighbor. It's just when people are manipulated into thinking that fixing the poverty problem is somehow giving people a free lotto ticket. It's just a fucked marketing campaign of the Paul Ryan austerity types, sitting pretty and calling out hate speech against the worst-off among us.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As we saw in the Santa Barbara massacre, the parents tried to warn cops but they needed access to his home. Now, a law is being passed so that concern IS the justifiable cause. This may help. 

I always hear that people don't want laws because law abiding citizens follow them and criminals don't. However, if we make selling a handgun without a background check illegal, all that does is put the good guys on notice to run background checks to ensure they aren't selling to a bad guy - which happens! Felons buy guns without background checks right now. One way or another we need that to end. If a GGWAG is selling in a private transaction and runs a background check and the buyer is a felon, the GGWAG has just potentially saved lives. I'll never get why someone who is supposedly a good guy gun owner would be against that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's come out that the majority of mass shootings have been done by people who have illegally obtained guns. It seems to ME that anyone pro-gun with half a brain would agree that background checks and registration would make their own gun ownership safer and more protected, because it could stop many of these massacres that make so many people afraid of gun owners. What's your take on this? Why not require background checks and registration of every firearm? </TEXT>

What matters is that he was known to be totally unbalanced and disturbed, yet was able to legally buy a fuckload of guns and ammo, and then keep those even when cops checked on him after tips that he was going to go off. What the actual fuck? Stop letting crazy people buy and own guns. Period.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right?? Had the cops been able to reference registered weapons, they'd have been able to seize them once the credible threat of violence had been reported to them. Instead they talked to the psycho and walked away, making it possible for him to assassinate innocent Americans. If we simply had registration similar to vehicle ownership requires, this would enable law enforcement to act appropriately and remove the weapons from the crazy fucks who post threats.  </TEXT>

Had we some way to regulate gun ownership like car ownership, those cops would have known he had a fuckload of guns and ammo in the house when they visited. The fact that this isn't the number one issue discussed after this gun terrorism is another bit if proof as to how powerful the weapons dealing NRA is.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of course, this is all too familiar: a young aggrieved male, mentally disturbed, threatening othersespecially womenbut still able to get his hands on a high-capacity magazine of the variety used in so many other mass murders. This doesn't happen in any other high income country with the regularity it does here; in fact, it almost never happens in any of them.

But here, in the good ole US of A, weve allowed a group of rich, entitled thugs who run an operation fronting for arms dealersguys who represent a minority position on pretty much every issue having to do with reasonable regulation of firearms even among gun ownersto dictate our policies to cowardly, careerist politicians.

<TEXT> No, it's the sanest thing he could say. To blame a gun, maybe a stretch. But the reason that certifiable nutters like the shooter can GET guns is the NRA and their beholden in congress. Just fucking make people prove they are not crazy before buying lethal weapons. What is so fucking hard about that concept? Yet the NRA blocks research, encourages insane responses from the fringes of their already-radical members, and fans the flames of these mass shootings. Fuck. How can anyone see this suffering beautiful father, his life FUCKING RUINED by a proven-crazy fucker who's family contacted the sheriff for fucks sake, and who was still, still able to procure a gun!- and argue against blocking crazy folks from buying and owning firearms? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nobody is going around spraying children with flying knives. However in the US we are sling people daily to gun terrorism. It's a plague we fight, despite trite trolls who claim cars kill people. In reality we license, inspect and keep a log of cars. If your car is stolen we can look up who has ever owned it, and trace via aerial number. That would be a great start to keeping track of the death toys.  </TEXT>

[Detectives found 20 unsecured guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition throughout the home of the family of a 3-year-old boy who accidentally shot himself in the abdomen March 3, according to reports released last week.
The boy, who survived the shooting, was flown to a Tucson hospital where he underwent surgery.
The case is being referred to the Pima County Attorney's Office, according to a Pima County Sheriff's detective. The boy's parents, Don and Sharina Marion, have not been arrested or charged. Don Marion is the volunteer fire chief for Elephant Head Fire Department.](http://www.gvnews.com/news/local/unsecured-guns-found-in-house-where-toddler-shot/article_1c5facb8-d965-11e3-bba4-001a4bcf887a.html?mode=jqm) </TEXT>
