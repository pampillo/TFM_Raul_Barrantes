<TEXT> People make the argument that it is okay that the information was leaked because swingers/poly peoples' SOs already know the information, so it is okay. I'm sorry I misunderstood your post. I'm not upset, nor was I was trying to "shit on" your post; quite the opposite. I was trying to have a conversation around the issue because I don't understand why Reddit (I'm basing that on the number or front page posts celebrating this hack) is so happy about this hack.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1- because this is a message board whee people converse
2- because it is hard to tell if your comment was a joke because that same logic has been used to justify the hack </TEXT>

<TEXT> And if the boss isn't an asshole? Do you see my point? People deserve privacy- even cheating assholes. I have a lot of swinger friends, and they keep it a secret because people are shitty and say shitty things like, "oh he/she must suck in bed, so that's why they have an open/swinging relationship". Having people find out about other peoples' private affairs, moral or immoral, is an inappropriate breach of privacy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I tried looking this place up, but I only saw a short 4 mile loop. Is that what you're doing? Or is there more there. I ask because I live in Sacramento and am always looking for trails to ride :)  I've done American River, Sacramento River, Santa Rosa area, a lot in SF, and in Davis.  </TEXT>
