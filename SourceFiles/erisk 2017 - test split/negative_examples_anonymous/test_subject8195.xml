<TEXT> 1. So I know there's not gonna be another season after seeing the whole third season circlejerk, but do they ever reach the North?

2. Is there manga or something I can read to see what happens?

3. Is it worth reading what happens, or should I just leave it at blissful unawareness and pretend they have fun adventures forever?

Thanks in advance.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Alrighty I got a quick question about Steins;Gate Zero and other things [SPOILERS] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-10 10:31:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I just finished my ninth rewatch of Steins;Gate.  
Or, I should say I watched it to episode 22, before he saves Kurisu and it sort of "ends" so to speak.

So this is where the question comes in.  
I started reading/read all of the available Steins;Gate Epigraph stuff of whatever when he's got major PTSD and stops pretending to be Hououin Kyouma.

From my understanding, does the events of the Epigraph stuff/Steins;Gate Zero happen when he declines Amane's offer to save Kurisu in episode 23 of the first season?

Then I'm assuming does this follow a world line where he decides to kick his ass back into being Hououin Kyouma?  
Or does it revolve around his darker side and his traumatic experiences from the first season?  
I hope the latter is the case because delving deeper into his psyche and how he was affected (like in the Epigraph stuff) sounds really really interesting.

Any insight would be awesome. Thanks.

<TEXT> Alright, so I've been getting ready to build a shiny new G3. I have a list of questions and other things to help me clear stuff up. The base build will be a JG G3 and I already have a cart of metal body parts ready.  
Now, the internals are a different story.

On BingoAirsoftWorks, he mentioned that the G3 used a standard M4 nozzle, and I noticed how the G3 uses a V2 gearbox. The only exception of course is the selector plate, I think.  
Is this true/will this work if I can just drop in a new V2 gearbox and a new selector plate ([like this](http://www.evike.com/products/25893/))?

Next, would be the hop up unit. I haven't the slightest clue what it uses. I have a JG G3 already, but I can't tell what it is. Google isn't too helpful when it comes to G3's.

I think that's the brunt of my questions, and any help would be awesome.

Quickish edit: I think I have everything I need with the exception of a motor.  
Here's a quick list,  
[Nozzle] (http://www.evike.com/products/25970)  
[Selector plate] (http://www.evike.com/products/25893)  
[Gearbox] (http://www.evike.com/products/24818)  
[Trigger] (http://www.evike.com/products/35885)

Only thing left I need is a motor, which I am clueless on </TEXT>

Actually if you want a little update, I returned the Oscar and the Pictus and got an oranda red cap gold fish for now.

As for my future plans I'm building an aquarium for a clown knife fish, and then the ten gallon I have now will become a feeder fish tank. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like HK guns because they have a certain style, new and old, that appeal to me. 

I like the G36 platform because of how the magazine looks. I also think the handguards are a good combo with the stock. Just look good together to me.

I like the look of G3 rifles because of the slim look of the handguard paired with the large 7.62 magazine. I think they pair well together.

I like the MP5k and MP5 series because of the weld marks (Same with the G3 I guess). Along with the handguard I think it gives it a simple, no bullshit look. 

I like the XM8 because it looks like a fish, and it has a futuristic look that appeals to me.

Finally I like most 7.62 platform guns (FAL, G3, SCAR-H) because of the larger magazines. To me, it gives it a sturdy look. This one is harder for me to explain, but that's a good way to put it.

Those are my raisins.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Alright boys this is a trial run of our first Instasynch night. 
Instasynch is a neat little site where there's a chatroom, and a video player. Everybody contributes to the video queue and votes on which videos to skip or to pass. 

Instasynch night will begin 7:00 PM CT (UTC-06:00) and end when everyone's bored. It'll be hosted in this room, http://instasync.com/r/A_irsoft.

Only rules are,  
1. Enough dank memes  
2. No spam (I guess?)

The playlist will remain locked until 7:00 PM CT </TEXT>

<TITLE> Lonex M4 receiver threads question/rail system compatibility question </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-19 23:02:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was wondering about the threads on the [Lonex M4 receiver] (http://www.evike.com/products/51385/) and I was wondering if it's automatically compatible with [Noveske NSR rail system.] (http://www.evike.com/products/43521/)

I was digging around online but I couldn't find any information. I saw [this] (http://www.evike.com/products/48636/) and was wondering if I had to buy that, or if I could just screw the rail system on the gun. Any help would be awesome. </TEXT>

As for the XM8, it's good but isn't what I was expecting. It shoots about as far as my AIM Top M4. About far enough to hit what I want, but pretty underwhelming. </TEXT>

<TEXT> WE's last pretty long stock and are more affordable than KJW M4's. They also have more upgrade options down the road, and have better quality control as of late. Plus, as the one guy said, the reason you see bad reviews is because more people buy them.

If more people buy something there'll be way more reviews of it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> But with WE the quality control has gone up and there's plenty of good aftermarket parts that you can use to upgrade and make it better than a KJW M4?

As far as I know, there aren't as many decent aftermarket upgrades for the KJW as there is more for the WE. I'd take a stock WE Open Bolt M4 and an NPAS for like 300 or so with the option of upgrading with better parts than a stock KJW M4 for 375 or so. 

Also, WE mags are cheaper and aren't too hard to fix if they're leaking.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> The most real lucid dream I've ever had </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-24 07:08:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is my most vivid lucid dream I've ever had, and it's a bit long but I hope you stick along for the ride. I usually induce lucid dreaming by meditating before I sleep or sleeping with my arms at my sides repeating mantras and shit. This was by far my most successful lucid dream ever. Usually I just fall into sleep paralysis, which I'm also cool with, but this was way different. The dream felt like it spanned a year, but there were random patches in it and time skipped a lot. Well here goes.

I woke up in a cabin of sorts, like a mini hotel room. When I looked out of the window I saw stars. A lot of stars. I got up and walked over to the mirror. What I saw was a older version of myself. It looked like me, but aged ten years (right now I'm 17). 

Then, I heard a knocking on the door. I was startled to say the least. A raspy voice addressed me with "Mr." and my last name, very formally. When I opened the door I was greeted by one oft he cantina aliens from Star Wars (the cute ones that play the catchy song). He told me the train would arrive in the seventh dimension in three days after making a few stops. He said that I would have a business conference to attend. It was then I realized I was dressed fairly corporate casually with a dress shirt and khakis. I was really confused but I obliged and said okay.

When he left I exited the cabin and went down the hall until I found another door. When I opened it I was greeted by a large congregation area. There were a bunch of people talking, more cantina aliens, and other confusing aliens. Shuffling through the crowd I bumped into somebody. After apologizing profusely I realized it was a girl I knocked down. She smiled and said it was okay. She was absolutely beautiful and I was awe struck in all honesty. She had black hair and eyes like mine, almost hazel but brownish. She was dressed in casual clothes and had a sun hat on. I noticed a large camera in her hands.

I asked if she was alright and instead of answering the question she said, "No, I'm Alice, what's your name?" I told her my name and she said we should have coffee later. 

I don't remember having coffee, but I remember sitting on one of the benches in the area we were before. She told me she was taking a college art course and that her assignment was to take pictures of other dimensions. It was the I looked at the surroundings that were around the train. 

White. It was **vibrant** white, and there were trees of all different colors all around us. Blue, red, yellow. Every color of the rainbow. I remember this so clearly in my mind still. It was so fucking beautiful. She stood up and started taking pictures. Then, she smiled and asked me if I thought it was beautiful.

I was awe struck and said of course. She then asked me what I did for a living. I told her I was on my way to a business meeting in the seventh dimension. She frowned, and said that was boring. Then, she asked if I wanted to tag along with her. I remember thinking, "Screw it, it's my dream." and said yes.

Things got hazy after that, and I remember going to Mars, where it looked similar to Cowboy Bebop Mars. Then I only remember going to a strange cave dimension, because when we were there she got a call about something. Her cheery expression turned to a worried expression and she quickly hung up after agreeing with whoever was on the phone. 

After that, she said she had to go and said sorry. I asked her why and what was wrong. She told me that she was sorry and didn't get back on the train. I was very sad and confused after that, afterall I was in love. Or at least it felt like I was, and that was scary for me. 

Things got hazy again and I remember it was like a few years passed. I was at my grandpa's farm again, where I lived before my current house, but there were more futuristic cars. I was running an estate sale (when people go through a dead person's house and buy stuff) for the family. 

Then I saw her again. She walked up to the deck, wearing the same sun hat as before. I walked outside and walked up to her. She almost jumped and hugged me. I asked her how she was doing and if she wanted to catch up. She obliged and the next day we met up at my house. Or at least where my house is now, but it was an apartment complex. 

When she showed up I asked her how her art was doing and her expression faded. Then she told me something about how she had to be a prostitute for money and that all of those years ago she got a call about prostitute stuff. I don't remember the details but I remember asking her if she wanted to run away or stay with me. She looked up at me and smiled, but started to tear up a bit. 

She said she had to go and couldn't be with me. This was crushing and I felt terrible. I asked if she wanted to spend the night for one last night. 

After that all I remember was holding her in a dark apartment before waking up to my alarm, crying. It was so scary to me. I've never had a dream so real. It was the most real dream I've ever had. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For some reason my parents have taken a liking to tanning beds because they want "more vitamin D" and when I crawled up from my cave to get some coffee they suggested I go with them.

Well suggesting turned into saying I don't get enough sun even though winter just got over here. I like my cave. I don't want skin canxer.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-04-14 05:09:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is something that happened to me awhile ago when I was 11. I figured writing it somewhere would help me feel better-ish. I'm just going to type it how it's written in my little manifesto of mine.

Back in 2009, or 2008? I can't remember the year but it was awhile ago. I'm 17 and it happened when I was 11 for reference. When I was younger I took a grand trip to Canada, Alaska, and Seattle with my grandparents and my cousin. The cruise started from port in West Seattle (like by the Space Needle-ish and the cool stuff.) 

When we arrived in Seattle we decided to stay at a hotel for three days to visit the Dry Soda Company (I saw it on Food Network and was curious) the Space Needle, and, regretfully, the famous Pikes Place Market. Well, not regretfully as in going there was bad, but the market is a dark place in my mind because of my experience. 

We explored the lights and sounds, and shopped the first day. That was amazing. Seattle was, and is, a beautiful city with beautiful sights. Well, the "supreme travel itinerary" as my grandma dubbed it, was that we'd go to the Pikes Place market on the second day. Now, I don't know how it looks now, but when I visited there were a lot of homeless people. My grandparents told me not to pay any mind to them and to ignore them. This made me sad. A blemish of sorts, but it didn't deter me from the whole face of Seattle.

I remember that whole morning as vivid as yesterday. I woke up, ignored the not-so-inviting continental breakfast and waited for my grandparents to finish. Hell, I even remember playing Yoshi's Island DS on my DS Lite. Well, they were always cheap.

They finished up and we were off. As soon as we left the entrance we were greeted by a young women. She was obviously homeless by the tattered clothes and McDonalds cup with loose change in it. She smelled like pot and paint thinner. She looked hungry and distraught. Her haggard frame didn't take away from her still young looking face. She seemed to be in her late 20's or early 30's from what I recall.

Anyways, I remember reaching for my pokemon themed wallet with the intent to give her change. As I went to rummage for a penny or two my grandpa scolded me and snatched the wallet from my hands. "No test_subject8195" he said, "There's a reason she's like that."

"There's a reason she's like that."

That stuck with me. It still sticks with me. Here was this human being reduced to the status of a stray dog, and he said that. I remember sighing, still shocked at his demeanor, and trailing behind them. I remember seeing a young gentlemen, probably a concierge or a bag boy, chase her off. "Oh well." I remember thinking. 

Fast forward through a sea of cardboard pleas, winos, and street performers and we reached our destination. Pikes Place Market. I remember splitting off from my grandparents and cousin while watching a young gentlemen toss a fish around and do other tricks. After he was finished I clapped, and turned around. 

Gone. My grandparents were nowhere to be found and I was caught in a sea of fish smell, patrons, and the sinking feeling that I was inevitably fucked. I scrambled through the crowd to no avail. The thick smog of bodies clouded my view, and my calls for help went unanswered. After breaking through the crowd I found a back alley. Scared, confused, and hoping for a break from the hustle and bustle I walked through the alley. 

Torn flyers, waste bins, and other arrangements of junk littered the passage. Then I heard it. The sound that haunts my dreams and my mind when it wanders.

Gurgling. A low mumbling gurgle laced with coughs and the unmistakable sound of struggling. It sounded rather odd, but my adventurous 11 year old brain led me to the source. Oh how I wish it didn't. How I wish I would have just sauntered off or turned around.

I walked over to a tipped over trashcan, and a dumpster. I didn't know what to expect, but it wasn't like the movies. It wasn't slow, but it was silent. Save for the god awful gurgling and struggling. I even remember the picture on what I now assume was a craft beer bottle strewn along with the forgotten waste. There was a rabbit with a shit eating grin on its face giving a thumbs up. Soon after seeing that my eyes led me to the source of the sounds. 

It was a kneeling yet slumped, convulsing pile. Then she looked up. It was the homeless woman from earlier. I stumbled back and recoiled in fear. "She must have knocked over the trash can and hurt herself" I thought. The thought seems innocent now, and I wish it would have been the case.

Her tattered black hoodie was caked in what appeared to be vomit and bodily fluids. It was still fresh because I remember the smell overwhelming me. Then I saw it, there was a needle jutting out of her arm. At the time I couldn't comprehend what it was, or why the woman was acting so strange. It's that innocence I wish I could still possess. 

But no, this woman was overdosing. She was dying. In front of my eyes, this woman was dying and I couldn't do jack shit to save her. I was a kid, and I was afraid. 

She looked up at me and her lips seemed to try to form words, but nothing happened.  Merely shaking and more trembling before she fell and slumped even further on to the grimey alley ground. The look still haunts me, it still causes me to have panic attacks or throw up if I picture it well enough. The best way I can explain it without forcing myself to think too much about it, is milk with a little blue dye in it. That's what her skin looked like.

She feebly reached out at my pant leg. I stepped back more, and then she slumped over. I wasn't sure if she was dead, but I nudged her with my foot. She didn't move. She was dead, she had to be. 

I screamed. I screamed louder than I ever will in my life. I ran after that, probably the fastest I'd ever run too. I ran back the way I came, past the stupid fucking rabbit bottle, past the flyers, past the market area where I was before. I only stopped when I reached the gift shop area.

I cried. I cried more than I ever will I think. I never cared for my grandparents, let alone any of my relatives, but I was elated to find them browsing the selection of shirts. They were wondering why I was crying.  I eluded to the fact that I watched a woman die, and rather just told them I was hysterical because I was lost. I still wish that was the case looking back. 

I feel, like a part of me died when that woman died. I feel like watching anybody die an untimely and violent death would kill something inside of anybody. Seattle was, and is, a beautiful city with beautiful sights. 

I am never going back there though. I'm going to leave whatever part of me died there. That's the way it's meant to be.

<TEXT> Put off watching Cowboy Bebop for far too long because so many other shows seemed more appealing. I thought, "Oh old show, so it must be drawn old and gross." 

After listening to some of the soundtrack and a friend bugging me to watch it too much, I fired up Deluge and torrented that mother. Two words. Holy shit.

The whole story was amazing, the animation and art style was **leagues** ahead of the time. For 1998 it's a really pretty show. That coupled with the great soundtrack and story bumped it up into my top five.

If you've been putting off watching this show or feel iffy about it, watch it. 9/11 would watch again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm doing a presentation on depression in adolescence for my sociology class and since I have no friends or people to survey at my school I'd like to ask you guys some questions here if that's allowed. If only teens could answer that'd be ideal, but if you guys remember being depressed as teens/have had depression since your teen years I'd love those answers too. 

1. How old are you?  
2. Are you male of female?  
3. At what age were you diagnosed with depression?  
4. What is depression like for you?  
5. What is the root of your depression?  

If this type of post then I don't mind if it's deleted, but if you guys could answer I'd love to bring light to this topic in my presentation. This survey would help a lot.  </TEXT>

It also plays before this when Asuna and Kirito are flying back to their cabin they lived in during the Aincrad arc. It appears countless other times in the show but this is all I could think of for how to find it off of the top of my head. Any help would be great, I need to download this song somehow.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Tokyo Marui PSG-1? Worth the trouble? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-15 05:22:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've decided on playing a designated marksman/sniper-ish role and I've been researching a lot of different rifles and found myself really digging really long snipers and guns of the 7.62 variety. After looking around I thought a G3 would really fit this role. Sadly, the only decent option would be the Classic Army G3, which I can't find in stock anywhere or the Tokyo Marui G3, but I don't like ordering from non-American retailers because of shipping price. This left me with the option of the JG G3, or the Marui PSG-1 which I was far more welcoming of. Also, I love how it looks and it's *loooooong*.

After digging through pages of Google searches and picking through YouTube trying to find a decent review or video of it in action, I couldn't find much. All that I really got out of my research was that it had a weird air nozzle or cylinder or something, it's old, and it's **creaky.** The creaky thing was the most stressed out of anything, which I don't really mind. 

Now, I'm not the tech savviest guy. I can change a hop-up, motor, and some other junk. Nothing too godly. My concern is that this gun won't perform as I need it to stock, and I'm not sure I can do what I need to get it shooting great. I know there are plenty of other guns in the price point that will outperform this gun a thousand times over, but I can't get over the great look of the PSG and I want something unique. 

Will the Marui PSG-1 be worth it if I get it? Will it make all of my wildest operator dreams come true? Or should I get researching another option for my designated marksman adventures? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Quiet and dependable side arm options? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-10 20:21:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm delving into the world of sneakier gameplay and the designated marksman sort of role, and have mostly everything planned out. Except for a side arm. Now I've had bad experiences with GBB's and I want something that I can play with all year that won't die on me. Now I've narrowed down my choices and read/watched about every review about some of my choices, but I'm still iffy.

Tokyo Marui MP7 AEP is my first choice because I've heard nothing but good things about it, I heard that it's quieter and have seen videos of it shooting and it seemed quieter than the normal AEG/AEP. 

My next choice would be the Galaxy/CYMA MP5K but it's hard to find in the US and I've heard mixed reviews about it. What's nice about the MP5K is that it uses a normal gearbox so maintainence isn't as big of a deal. 

My final choice would be the JG MAC-10 or possibly the marui, but I want to keep it HK for the sake of my guns matching. The JG seems nice though and sturdy. It's also really really quiet from the videos I've seen of it shooting. 

I'm stuck and I don't know what to do. What are your guys' opinions? Are any of these a good choice? Do you guys have any good options or ideas? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> To give a little background, I just turned 17 on the third, don't know if this has anything to do with anything. Some of my Reddit friends may see that I posted this, I don't really care. I want to travel the world and I want more now. I live in a shitty small town of only 1,000 to 1,200 people. At this point in my life my grades are only good enough to get out of highschool. I own a small business doing graphic design and articles, and I wash dishes at a local restaurant and started training to cook, but that won't get me anywhere. I need to take charge but it's so hard. When I graduate I'm either going to be a neet, or working my shitty jobs living in a shitty apartment. Now, I've had plans to take two years of general studies and get some sort of art degree, but I don't think that will get me where I want to be or anything. I just want to help people and see the world, and get away.

Now that that's out of the way. I would follow my uncle's footsteps and join the military, but even then I don't think it'd be worth it. I don't believe in anything that we're fighting for. Would joining the peace corps or whatever work? Should I just pack up and leave when I turn 18 and freelance? I'm at my wits end, but the only thing I really want now is to be away and to help people.  </TEXT>

Walking to school was awesome. Sitting in class was awesome. I actually talked to people and didn't give a fuck about how I looked. Psycho ex girlfriend's friend stabbed me in the hand with a pencil and I shrugged it off and called her a stupid cunt. Everything was fun and had meaning. It was weird. 

Whenever I would get in trouble in class before the teacher said what I did bad I would just take the detention, tell them what I did, explain why I know it's wrong and why I have fun being a dick, and then I'd go off to my next class. They didn't even have anything to say I was so on top of shit all day.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> RIP My DSi 2008-2014 Memorial Post </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-02 21:10:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After five years of usage my DSi died today. It's been across the US from Wisconsin, to South Dakota. It's even been to Canada. My DSi has gone with me through various moves, and different houses as well. I was 11 when I first got it. I remember going to Gamestop with my dad to get it, and being first in line at the stroke of 12:00 AM. I remember the giddy excitement and first turning it on and tinkering with it during the car ride home. I remember pure joy. 

It didn't have a name or anything, just my initials carved in the back. I've beaten countless games, and played through many games of Pokemon with it. I've beaten many people too with my DSi, and won many battles. I've had many great times during lunch with friends playing Pokemon,  trading, battling. I've had countless adventures. I've had many a good memory with my DSi in hand. 

Over the course of the past five years I've taken my DSi all over the US. When I was 11, I took my DSi to Washington, Alaska, and even Canada. I remember taking it to the top of the Seattle Space Needle, and through the bustling Pike's Place Fish Market. While taking a cruise in Alaska I played my DSi looking to the open ocean. I took it to the beautiful Butchart Gardens of British Columbia, Canada. When I was living at my grandfathers farm my sisters and I took a trip to South Dakota. I remember sitting in the beating sun looking over the barren Badlands with my DSi in hand. I even took pictures of a rabbit we found with my DSi. 

While moving from my grandfathers house to where I lived on the golf course I remember buying Pokemon White, the game I played until today. By now the corners were smashed/damaged and the L and R buttons on top didn't even work. As long as I could play Pokemon I was content. While working on the house, painting, and during the move I remember good times defeating the new game while taking breaks. While living at this house though I took a break from my DSi. This time was spent diving into the world of Call of Duty and X-box, so I would fit in with others. My DSi took it's rest in my desk drawer collecting dust. 

A year or so would pass, and eventually I would move into the house I am living in now. During the move I found my DSi, and dug up a charger. After plugging it in, bingo, it worked. I started a new game on Pokemon White and began to play a lot more. My X-box had become repetitive, but I found time for both game systems. This past year was the most time I had ever spent playing on my DSi and I even made a good friend in the process. 

With the introduction of school issued I-pads I figured, more people were playing games, and if I were to play my DSi nobody would care. This I was correct on, and I would begin my day in Photography class on Pokemon White smart mouthing the teacher. This I regret, however playing I do not. I would find time in the hallways to play, during my study halls in the school library, and in Geometry class. I had been playing one day during lunch and a now good friend Jacob struck up a conversation about what I was playing. Before this I never talked with about much, and Pokemon became our common ground. Every day we would play during lunch and get stronger, battle, trade. This past year was great, and my DSi was being used to it's full potential. 

Today, while waiting for my student teacher conference I sat in the car, and sipped on my cup of coffee. I felt around in my pocket for my DSi, which I always carried with me. I flipped it open as usual, clicked and tapped away, and played Pokemon like usual. While playing the screen froze. Odd enough, but I thought it was probably the cartridge. I turned it off, closed it, and took out the game. I inspected the game, and the slot. Everything seemed normal so I plugged the game cartridge back in and turned it on. It turned on, but the screen was white. It remained frozen and then shut off. Since the battery was fully charged from the night before, I attempted to turn it on again. Nothing. I had assumed the worst, closed my DSi, and came to terms with it's demise before going to my conference. 

5 years of pure joy is what my Nintendo DSi had brought me, and it was worth every penny. There are so many other adventures I've left out of this, but so many that will not be forgotten. I used my DSi until the day it couldn't run, and simply couldn't turn on. 5 years of pure joy.

<TITLE> Last Day of Summer For Me </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-01 21:44:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Pretty shitty last day to say the least, and I had it all planned out to make it the best last day of summer ever. 

**Fuck Up No. 1**  
I planned to go for a walk with this girl I like and then go back to her place to play guitar and shit. This was supposed to be at 12:00 in the afternoon, I woke up merely twenty minutes ago as I write this.

**Fuck Up No. 2**  
My pizza oven broke and my regular oven isn't working. I really really wanted a stuffed crust Tombstone pizza to lift my mood.

**Fuck Up No. 3**  
The girl mentioned before called me. You know when you answer the phone and you're nervous and you accidentally hang up? Ha, well of course that happened. Oh also, now she thinks I'm mad at her. 

**Fuck Up No. 4**  
So when I'm bummed out, sometimes shooting my airsoft guns is fun. I went to grab my good ol' [JG AUG] (http://i.imgur.com/BqMGLVH.jpg) from the wall to plink around at some cans. It would not fire. I take off the barrel and receiver and look around inside looking for some sort of answer. Nothing. Fucked. My dad is letting me order my new gun when he gets home anyways, so hey not too bad. 

**Fuck up No. 5**  
My grandmother died. Fell down the stairs, hit her head, aneurysm, whatever. I don't care that she died, I just don't want to miss work for a funeral. I want to make money. Also, I have to be a pallbearer and I don't want to carry heavy things while people stare at me. Fuck. 

Well at least I have some anime and instant coffee to make this day at least 25% better. How is/was your guys' last day of summer?  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-08-27 06:35:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I told him that just because the gun is heavy doesn't mean it's realistic and he replied,

 "I know but I mean the heaviness makes it feel like you have a real weapon. Air soft is a great sport don't get me wrong but paintball is more of a rush when playing since being shot in the head with a paintball gun can kill you if they cheat where as with air soft gun hurt but the worst it can do is break skin or hit an eye."

Wat. 

Edit: I looked up the annual injuries in paintball, averaging around 20 per every 100,00 annual players. I also showed him a chart and demolished this argument. I'll post what he says next. 

Another Edit: He said he had to go do chores and that the argument was over. Ha.

<TEXT> Besides airsoft I'm guessing you guys have different hobbies too, so what stuff do you guys like to do?

I like to play instruments with a small circle of friends, and we kind of have a band but it isn't anything too serious. I love to play guitar, and [I also collect guitars.] (http://i.imgur.com/5dlTnM2.jpg) 

To the left is my BC Rich Warlock. I paid about $700 for this guitar. 

To the right is my custom Jackson that a friend of the family rebuilt and repainted. This project was overall about $1000.   

Here's a [picture of my main guitar] (http://i.imgur.com/wZBJ1ja.jpg) that I play the most. It's a custom Fender Stratocaster that the same guy made custom tailored to my size, it has a scalloped neck because it's the most comfy way for me to play, and custom pickups that sound better while playing in the basement. This guitar was the most pricey at a cool $2,600. 

I also watch a shit ton of anime and play video games. 

Edit: Oopsy I also have a [drum set,] (http://i.imgur.com/VtsZo9a.jpg) but I don't play drums as much anymore. Usually I just teach my friend who plays the beats or what he needs to play. 

Wait what's that white part in the edge of the shot? Well we put a [black light] (http://i.imgur.com/bVMqn9A.jpg) above the drums for shits and giggles, then the white part is a [poster] (http://i.imgur.com/yLc842c.jpg) from an old school project. Put them together and you get something [kind of ominous.] (http://i.imgur.com/32HCzoD.jpg) Thought I'd throw this in because I thought it was funny.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know, I know it sounds gay, ineffective, etc. but hear me out. 

I was thinking about my perfect comfortable/effective kit, and I was also thinking about solid color loadouts. Now one time with some friends we we're messing around and playing some pick up games after the day was over. At this point I had taken off my BDU pants, and put back on my usual **mens** skinny jeans (like that matters really.)

Here's the thing, they didn't really restrict my movement as much as I thought, and they were still comfy as fuck. 

Next, would be my next loadout choice, I want to try something different and do an all tan loadout. I know this won't blend well, but I don't really care. I usually push up and run anyways. The whole point of this is really, would khaki skinny jeans looks goofy with an airsoft kit? I don't think it would look that bad.  </TEXT>

A. My skills are rusty.

and

B. I'm lazy and it'll look like shit because all I have is black thread (the knee pads are tan.)

So do you guys have any suggestions? I'm a small guy with small knees, and I need knee pads. I have some old Pro Tech pads from my mom because she plays roller derby and she gave me her old pads. I would use the Pro Techs but they don't look "totally uber oper8ter" enough for me. 

Edit: I'm checking out these [BLACKHAWK!] (http://www.amazon.com/BLACKHAWK-Advanced-Tactical-Knee-Pads/dp/B005GA7MWS/ref=cm_cr_pr_pb_t) ones but it sucks because I have no way of telling whether or not they'll work for small legs/knees. This is the case with all knee pads.

**We left off with me making a channel and starting to play airsoft again**

So I got about $1000 worth of gear because I don't go anywhere or spend money. The airsoft stuff ends here because I'm starting my tour of public fields with my friend when I get my license. Otherwise back to the girl of the story,

Things didn't work out with [neckbeard] (https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/t1.0-9/10583843_830625146982733_3372155739179801587_n.jpg) and her. She almost turned to self harm, and I stayed up until five o' clock on the phone with her to calm her down. This was just mid July. We agreed to coffee and just catching up.

She told me about what happened with her and neckbeard. He insisted she dress up in public, and then he tried raping her but she beat him up. I came clean about losing my virginity, and then the unexpected happened. She started to cry. I couldn't help it either and I started to cry as well. The thing is, is that I love her, and she loved me. In the end I wish I would have lost my virginity to her.

Blah blah that's lame. We began hanging out more and by the end of July we were (and are) back together. Now it's going into August, the tenth is coming up! Now we hang out all day, and I might even ask if I can spend the night one of these days. 

Well that's the story of my struggle with depression, and how I fell in love and shit. This tenth will be the seventh month for me cut free! 
If you actually read all of this boring shit, then thanks. If not then it'll be archived and chilling out on the internet for people of the future to read.  </TEXT>

[Link to previous post.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2ckofd/its_been_awhile_rdepression_i_just_need_to_thank/)

Okay continued. 

Around January I forgot to mention I got a job as a dishwasher and this comes up a bit here and there but I'll get to that in a bit. Overall it helped me make friends, and try pot for the first time! (I don't use it all the time don't worry, like once a month at most)

Around April/May I started talking to my next girlfriend a lot more. She was so cold though. She never cared about me in the slightest. I wouldn't say I fell back into depression by any means, but I felt like I had to fight for my next girlfriends attention. I was willing to do anything to make her happy, that's the only thing that hurts a little.
She wanted to have sex, and I wasn't really comfortable. At the time I was willing to do anything and if she wanted to, "Bond bodies" or some shit, whatever. That's how I lost my virginity. To be flat out I thrusted and watched It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia until she said she was done. It was terrible... 

I broke up with her after that, and it only lasted two weeks. After that I felt neglected, used, and I was on the verge of hurting. At work things were getting better at least though. I wanted to cook, and one of my dreams was to cook. I was confused, I wanted money, and I didn't care about anything at this point. This next part of my story gets darker, and I think about it a lot.

Around May/June to move up I got the main dishwasher fired. He was already slow, but still fast enough to be proficient at his job. I knew he was from the town over, and got in trouble for being in possession of marijuana all the time. I told the police department about the pot he liked to hide in his hoodie sweatshirt that he always wore. 

He wasn't at the restaurant when they came, but the police barging into the restaurant was enough to get him fired. That's how step one of my plan went into action, I was lead dishwasher, and I got bumped up from $7.50 and hour to $8.25 and hour as the lead dishwasher. The only thing I thought about was how to become a cook at that point. 

One of the main cooks was barely a year clean from smoking crack and just getting back on his feet. His name was Warren. He had a free ride to college on a hockey scholarship and he threw it away to do drugs all day. The boss's son was one of the cooks, and was already teaching me things here and there in his free time. I was absorbing the information well. I was learning how to prep and how to cook from watching and doing stuff in my spare time. 

The hardest part was getting Warren to smoke crack again. I even hung out with him and the bosses son athis place. I tricked him, and I fucked with his head a lot. He'd still talk a lot about how it made him feel, or how amazing it was. I would entice him, and I would say things like, "It's human nature to do what you want," or "Sure it's unhealthy, but you'll be thinking about smoking it for the rest of your life."

This was about the end of June. I stay up some nights thinking about it. About how I'm a "sick mother fucker" or a terrible person. I didn't care. I wanted to cook, I wanted money, and Warren was in the way. They found him buying some in an alley a few towns over, that's what my boss told me. With that the position was mine, and I was bumped up to $9.50 an hour. 

With the money I was making I decided to get back to getting my license. My test is on the 6th and I'll probably get my license. But that has nothing to do with the story, I'm just happy! I bought a car from a friend of the restaurant for $500. A '98 Monte Carlo something something, I don't know. I'm not a car guy. 

I got back into airsoft, I got more gear and money, and I started up a channel with an old pal. I think I need to continue the story to part 3 but I don't know. Here's a picture of the bracelet she made me with my airsoft gear! It's the rainbow one on my left arm. http://i.imgur.com/twpx4QL.jpg

<TEXT> So this is the story of how I got over my depression, and your guy's help in all of this, if you decide to read this wall of text then thanks!

It was the tenth of December, and I just turned 16 on the third. I didn't bother to get my license because I had nobody. I had a lack of friends, lack of motivation, and I just wanted to die. On the ninth I cut myself two times in the morning before school, and wore my favorite sweater to cover it up. When I got home I tried again. It felt like I had nothing more to do, and that was it. I was a hermit, and the only place I felt safe or happy was my room in the basement. I even bought a couch, and a bunch of instruments to occupy my time.

This was all on an old account, but I remember asking you guys about how to talk to people or get friends. I remember one of you said I should try talking to girls. This was weird because usually girls made fun of me and pushed me away. You guys said it would really help, and you were right! There was one person who really got me out of this, and of course you guys too :D.

I had been talking to and texting this girl from my science class for awhile beforehand, at least two months. She was really the only person who showed me genuine kindness at the time, and it felt amazing. I spiked up my hair like I like to do, put on my second favorite sweater, and got really excited. I asked her to go for a walk at her favorite place, the water tower hill. Eventually it became my favorite place to be too! She wasn't allowed to have guys over at the time so we met at the hill whenever we could. *Sorry for rambling on back to the story...*

So I remember rolling up my sleeves because it was either really hot outside, or I was nervous and really sweaty. Of course stupid me, I forgot about my cuts. When we met at the bottom of the hill she saw my cuts. I started to cry, a lot. I got embarrassed and almost ran away, that's how it always was when people saw my cuts or scars. But she grabbed my hand, it was a funny feeling and the first time I ever really held a girls hand. She told me it was okay and then she hugged me too. That was also the first genuine hug I had ever gotten (honestly my parents didn't/don't give two shits about me.)

When we got to the top of the hill, I asked her if she would think differently of me. I remember thinking, *why did I just ask?* and thought about the usual, "Well duh stupid emo" or something along those lines. No matter what I hope until the day I die, the way she smiled at me and said that it didn't matter. That it didn't change anything. That she really really liked me. I remember hugging her really really tight, and her hugging me really really tight, and it felt great. I wanted it to last forever.

The whole time we walked back to the bottom of the hill we held hands really tight. It was the first time I had smiled for more than fifteen minutes to be honest. When we got to the bottom of the hill she stopped and looked in my eyes like before. She said, "No matter what you can't never (her grammar is a little shotty at times but I think it's cute) ever hurt yourself like that again." I remember tearing up a lot, but I was still smiling. I agreed, of course I would! We hugged again and she was off to her house before her parents got mad.

The next few months we met up more and more. We talked at school **way** more than before too. She made me [this] () bracelet too so I'd, "Always be happy" and to remind me to never break our promise. Over January I met her parents, and even went bowling with them and stuff. They had excepted me, and I felt like I belonged. 

Fast forward to February, we were hanging out at her house and of course Valentines day was rolling around. It was to the point where everybody knew we had a thing, or were together. At that point we never really made it official, we just had a lot of classes together and we were always together if we could be. By the time Valentines day was upon us I asked her to go for a walk, and I asked her out at the top of the hill. (Cliche but I'm not creative so whatever lol) Then I had my first kiss! 

Over March though, things got bad. Her birthday was on the 13th, but I didn't remember it, I made an anti Semitic joke at dinner (turns out her father is Jewish), and we grew apart somehow. I felt sad, but I also didn't. As long as she was happy, and as long as we could still be friends. 

Over April she began talking to [this] (https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/t1.0-9/10583843_830625146982733_3372155739179801587_n.jpg) neckbeard guy and we all hung out together a lot. I had moved on to a different girlfriend, but things weren't the same.  
 

I think I have to make a continued post sorry. 

Edit: I FORGOT A PICTURE OF THE BRACELET D:. Oh well on the next post.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I really needed to go and I had a *shitty* day so I thought it would give me a good laugh. I wiped with a sock, and it's also in the box. It smells really bad and the majority of my family is right upstairs in the family room. What do I do please help it's terrible. 

Edit: I tried pulling it out using a fly swatter like a little arm and broke open the poop and now the smell is just spreading even more please help it's in the corner of the room right now. 

Edit: The smell stopped spreading because I put a bag over it but for the time being, this is only a temporary solution.

Edit: I took it upstairs in an attempt to put it in the garage or something. My dad asked for a Cheezit, and then said, "Ah what the fuck dude did you fart?" and then I ran downstairs mumbling about moderator stuff for a subreddit. 

Edit: Someone asked for an update for his enjoyment, but this isn't really fun for me. My parents like to stay up late and I'm in a festering room of stench for at least three more hours. I put a scarf under the door so air doesn't escape. 

Edit: The bag on the box isn't blocking anything anymore. I have an old surplus gas mask but it's only been for decoration up to this point. I'm not sure if it will work. 

Edit: The mask is working a little bit, but it just smells like old books and rubber. 

Edit: My parents asked me to let the dogs outside and I'm afraid they'll figure out.

Edit: Forgot a period on the last update. 

Edit: I'm going to let the dogs out and take the box outside with me. I'll get the dog to eat it. 

Edit: Okay the dog ate the poop, but the box is still smelly. I wouldn't be able to put it in the garbage without the smell getting everyone's attention. 

Edit: What do I do with the box? My dad has a pool table and hangs out in the garage, if I put it in the garage garbage can will the smell go away by tomorrow morning? 

Edit: I took the box and put it in the street adjacent to our house. 

Edit: The sock is still in there.

<TEXT> So a friend and I are doing a two man team sort of thing and we have our channel set up and everything. Now he already had ACU and I didn't want to make him buy a new pair of BDU's so I just got ACU camo too. I also like how it looks with tan gear so I was into the idea. 

But now I'm watching loadout videos on YouTube and gameplay and all of the poor, beginner, children, or noob loadouts include ACU gear of some kind. Did I make a mistake? [Here] (http://i.imgur.com/twpx4QL.jpg) is a picture of my current set up that I'll be running.

If it really is too bad I'll just get some Multicam BDU's for myself and then buy him some for his birthday so he doesn't have to buy any. Sure Multicam is average, but ACU is too. At least with Multicam we look a little better on the field. Right?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm your average run-of-the-mill 16 year old teenage nerd dude. I just go about life right now working, and laying on the couch on Reddit. I want more, I really do, but I have one friend and nowhere to go. My only friend who's a girl, let's call her Allyson, is dating a douchey dude and she never wants to hangout now because of it. My only hobbies are watching anime, airsofting, and very seldom video games. The same song and dance. Every. Fucking. Day.

What really pisses me off is that all of the cooks at work patronize the fuck out of me even though I've been working there for eight months washing dishes for money to fuel the only hobby I have (I just watch anime online and shit, never bought anything.) One time the old pizza delivery guy even beat me with a mop. A fucking mop. I've been made fun of so much and hurt so much I just take it. I feel like an elephant at a circus every day. I can't quit or tell anyone because my dad is best friends with the restaurant owner. They all pretend to want to be my friend for shits and giggles too, and I've fallen for it twice.

The first time I went over to one of their houses with the Boss's son (Let's call him Vinny). When I walked up there were a bunch of older dudes (around 20) and all I did was stand there and wait for them to tell me to leave. I had no place there, and Vinny knew it. But no let's drag Tommy to Mitch's house just for shits and giggles. Only fun part was watching Mitch trying to pry his bong from his dog's mouth.

After all of this, I've been tricked and played. I just don't care. They poke and pry and tell me to "hang out" or shit. I just don't care. Even if something could be genuine I shrug it off. I've been broken. I've shrugged everything off lately. I've accepted laying here, drinking my coffee, with my eyes locked on this screen for at least five hours at a time. When I'm alone like this it's the only time I feel like I'm me. I don't know what to do, how to change, or who I am. 

This past eight months has changed me so much, and I don't know the real me. I sleep a lot and lucid dream because it's a great escape to be honest. I go to work at 5:00 pm so I just sleep until 4:00 pm so nobody bugs me. I then work and try to shrug off the hate as much as I can, and then I go home and cry. I cry for like a half an hour and then I sit on forums and shit until 4:00 am and then go to sleep and start again. 

My parents have noticed me changing now too and I'm afraid. My facial expressions have died, my sense of humor dulled, and I just don't feel like getting up. My parents have started accusing me of drinking or drugs. I don't even listen, I just drown it out so I can go back downstairs and be alone. The only genuine joy I've felt lately was three days ago when I went for a walk at the water tower hill where I used to walk with Allyson. I lied back in the grass and thought about how we used to watch clouds and she'd just say random things that she didn't even see. 

I don't know. I just don't care. I don't want to kill myself because it'll hurt. I've been 7 months self harm free because I promised Allyson I wouldn't because she's 10 months self harm free. Also, she made me this bracelet and sometimes I see it and think about her. But what do I do? What can a kid do when he's so broken that he doesn't know who he is. I don't care. That's all I can do.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I had nothing better to do when I got up at 1:00 pm, I went back to bed and set an alarm for 2:00 pm. When I fell asleep I first remember being in my room, and I got up and went to the kitchen. I told myself, "This is a dream, I can do what I want."

Then I heard gun shots and I saw a bad guy pretty far off, but near my house. I looked down and there was a sniper rifle in my hands. I shot the bad guy, and then I thought, "I wish my friend Alex was here."

"Hey Tommy we got two more out front," IT WAS MY FRIEND. NUH UH. 
So I shot one guy who was out front and another guy and then I went downstairs and my friend disappeared. Then I woke up. 

But the whole time I was aware of the fact it was a dream and I thought up the gun and my friend right? It felt like I was totally in control.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm too afraid to tell my parents, or my friends but I've been seeing things. It started about a year ago, and I've had this inner monologue thing. It isn't my voice though. It's a calm male voice, around the age of twenty. He just *narrates* and **narrates** with breaks every once in awhile. I've read up about violent voices and violent things and it's just this damn narrating. Hell it's even talking right now. I just call the voice Josh. In my Spanish class one time it was being particularly annoying and I couldn't help but yell out, "Shut the hell up."

Now Josh has kept talking and still does a lot. But three months ago is where it really gets scary for me. I was taking a walk at my favorite place near the town water tower. As I walked down the path I saw a white dog, and it was really furry. When I walked closer I clapped my hands a bit and said, "Come here" and then the dog just disappeared. It didn't vanish or like vaporize, it was just gone. 

What do I do? I'm too afraid to tell anybody and I'm afraid it will get worse. I'm only 16 and I'm really really really scared. I've heard of far worse cases and I'm afraid people will call me crazy or send me somewhere. What do I do? </TEXT>

<TITLE> I Think I Know What These Dreams Are, or What's Happening To Me </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-19 20:19:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For years and even to this day I've had the same dream a few times a week and I've never figured out why. What happens is I'm stuck on my couch (I sleep on a couch instead of bed) and I can't move at all. Then two giant rat men walk into the room and look straight at me, and these guys are **really really** scary looking. 

At this point they both look at eachother and whisper something into eachother's ears. They look at me again and instantly materialize chairs in their hands, and take a seat. Then they sit there and stare at me. They just **stare** this terrifying death stare.

The only way for me to wake up is to whisper, *"Mom"* for a really long time three times and then I wake up in the position that I was in the dream. Arms right to my side, and looking right at the door.

Does this have to do with lucid dreaming? I think it must have something to do with it.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Any of You Guys Lose Any Friends/Loved Ones in the Plane Incident Yesterday? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-19 07:09:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I lost a friend on Xbox that I met while on a cruise a year or so ago. His name was Dmitri. He was seventeen years old. He was a really really nice guy and he was on his way home from vacation with his grandparents. He liked Minecraft, various animes, and he was planning on going to go to college to be an anesthesiologist. 

When I sent him some messages today wondering if he was up for some Battlefield 4 I didn't get a response right away. His mother replied and told me to join a private chat. Though her English was rough, she got the message across that her son had been on the plane. I told her that her son was a great guy and that I was sorry for her loss. 

I just wanted to share this so more people would know he was a great guy, and he was a human being who deserved more than this. Everyone on that plane was. 

Edit: lost not lose oops  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Recoil Shock SCAR-H. Really Worth the Money? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-11 22:37:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm contemplating my next addition to the armory. I've always loved SCAR's, and I've always turned back to SCAR's when looking for a gun I truly want. 

When I was first thinking of GBBR's I almost got the WE Open Bolt SCAR-L. When I wanted to do a designated marksman loadout I thought of getting the VFC SCAR-H SSR. But out of all of these a SCAR-H really stuck out.

Since there isn't a GBB SCAR-H, the VFC isn't blow-back, and P* or Daytona Guns are out of the question I was immediately drawn to the [SCAR-H Recoil Shock by Tokyo Marui] (http://echigoya-guns.com/guns/index.php?route=product/productpath=36_35product_id=446).

How is the gun overall? I can't find many reviews, but from what I've seen it seems like a gun I can run for a really long time. Would it be good for medium range to longer ranges? I don't like to upgrade and would like a good stock gun. Anyways, any help would be awesome. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So after reading some stories here I thought this was another fun subreddit to come on and read some stories.

Well today I was talking to this girl I've been talking to for awhile. Usually she'll get hurt by some guy or something and I'll always be her shoulder to cry on blah blah. Well we've been good friends for the better part of the last two years and lately she seemed interested in me so I came up with a plan to ask her out.

So I call her up, ask how she's doing, and ask if she wants to go for a walk at our favorite place to talk. She says yeah, but she wanted to bring a friend. I say sure and I meet her at the top of the hill by the water tower like always. But as I was walking up I could swear I could here a guy's voice.

Whatever, keep walking it's probably just her manly friend Hannah. As I turn the corner to look and sit next to her like I always do that's when I saw her kissing some dude. I don't know who is he is and never did before. 

Now me being as awkward as I've always been can only mutter, "Hey um hi hey so sorry bye sorry." and run off in tears. But as I reached about half way down the road I stopped. I realized I don't give a fuck, and I don't care. I've been chasing her for this long, and have been lead on for this long. Why should I keep chasing? The dude looked like he was about twenty (we're both 16) so she'll get hurt anyways. 

Well thanks a lot /r/howtonotgiveafuck you really helped me with this and helped me realize how to not care.  </TEXT>

**Scene 1
(Scene fades in and two people are seen. One slaving over a sink, the other drying.)**

**Tommy: (Wiping his sweaty forehead with his fore-arm)** Man...

**Dalton: (Turning to Tommy from his drying station)** When the heck do we get to leave? I have lonely videogames and soda waiting at home.

**Tommy: (Jokingly punching him)** Probably soon.

**(His boss walks in)**

**Vinny: (His voice is joking)** Hey **(whatever nickname he uses at the time)**, hey Dalton. Go sweep and mop the back, put that stuff away, and I'll have you out of here.

**Tommy: (His eyes light up)** Oh. Y-yeah! Okay. **(He grabs his towel and wipes his hands)**

**Dalton: (He goes to put away a container and drops it)** Dang!

**Tommy: (He picks it up and sighs. He goes to put it back in the machine)** Ah man.

**Vinny: (He grabs the container)** Hey it's fine, not like it'll start a super zombie pandemic huh?

**Tommy: (He laughs nervously)** Huh yeah probably not.

**(Camera zooms in as Vinny puts away the container on the stack of other containers. Their laughter is heard in the background as the scene cuts out abruptly. The title slams over the black screen)**


**Scene 2
(The scene cuts back in abruptly in a similar fashion as before. A text box that says, "3 Months Later" cuts into the scene just like the title. As the next scene plays out actors and music names will fade in. Tommy is sitting on a log at what appears to be a garabage dump)**

<TEXT> So with my drivers test around the corner I'm going to look for public fields. One field that got my attention was [Black Ops Airsoft] (http://www.blackops-airsoft.com/index.html) in Zion, Illinois. 

Has anybody been to this field? If so, how is the gameplay, area, or overall how the field is? Also one more question, I have a list of must haves if I'm going.

**1. Mask-** I'm getting [this mask] (http://www.evike.com/products/44222). Is mesh stuff okay? If not I'll just get a Dye mask or something.

**2. Gun Case-** I know I'll need to get a case, so I'll make sure to get that.

**3. Barrel Condom (hehe)-** This is what I see people put on their guns in videos at public field, so would [this] (http://www.evike.com/products/24715) suffice?

**4. Lastly, Dead Rag-** I'm assuming any old piece of red cloth would do, but I'm getting one with the Evike logo just to represent.

**5. New Spring-** So I'm getting a new [spring] (http://www.evike.com/products/31455/) since my FPS is really high on my gun. Will I be able to just throw this bad boy in my gun and be good to go?

Otherwise, I think I got everything down and I'm ready to go once I order everything. Am I missing anything?  </TEXT>

I'm only seventeen right now, and I would be totally content without being sexually active, all I really want to do is cuddle and stuff.

So we were hanging out today and she brought up the idea of sex. I thought, "Well that would be fun." I care enough about her to give her my virginity. But should I? She really really wants to at this point. I'm up for it, but I don't know if I should. I've never been in a relationship where I didn't bring up the idea. 

She said something about wanting to, "Bond our bodies physically," and "Become closer" or something. She's also 17, but not a virgin. Should I go through with this? Will it jeopardize anything? I'm totally blind on the subject and have no clue what to do. HELP.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is my current set up I'm going to be running for the better part of this summer. I've always loved the look of the average PMC kit so I went in that direction. Please excuse the tactical skinny jeans, I just got off of school and at the time I took these pictures and I was as giddy as a child on Christmas. Don't fret, I use eye-pro, I just left them at a friends house. For the purpose of picture, I thought my casual prescriptions would be fine. 

[FUCK WHEN EVER I TRY TO FORMAT PRETTY THE IMAGES ARE TINY SO HAVE AN ALBUM OF THE PICTURES NORMAL] (http://imgur.com/a/ArEwK)


**KIT LIST FROM TOP TO BOTTOM**

**Hat-** Basic tactical cap from Condor

**Patch-** Sassy MilSpec Monkey patch

**Comms-** Just a basic Element headset

**Shemagh-** Basic black and white Condor shemagh

**Jacket-** Just a Condor Softshell Jacket, nothing special

**Patch-** Hazard PVC American Flag Patch

**Chest Rig-** No name brand I added to the cart 

**Dump Pouch-** Just a Condor Drop Leg dump pouch

**Knee Pads-** Standard Condor quick release knee pads

**Sling-** GP sling plate, came with a one-point sling

Other than that I'll probably just get some Khaki's or some blue jeans to finish off the kit. 

**GUN**
It's a bone stock WE Open Bolt M4 I posted a little while back with a previous kit. I run four magazines right now, but plan to get at least six more (I'm very trigger happy.) Otherwise I hope you enjoyed my kit, and I tried to keep everything as detailed and nice as possible.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So during the recent time I airsofted I couldn't wait to field my brand new WE Open Bolt M4, but there's one problem... It was too cold. 

It never occurred to me and I ended up just filming and taking pictures. But now I want a new AEG for when it is too cold out for my GBBR, and so I won't miss out on the action.

So I've narrowed down my search to two guns. My price range with everything I need to play is about $500.00 to $650.00.  I just want a gun that is guaranteed to work, that will last me awhile, and will have good performance at short to medium ranges. 

My first choice is the [VFC SCAR-L] (http://www.evike.com/products/45160). I've always loved SCAR's and I've seen just about every review on this gun drooling over it. 

My second choice would be the [GG GK-5C] (http://www.evike.com/products/44551/). I know this a newer gun to the airsoft scene, and I couldn't find many reviews on it. Has anybody used this gun/know anything performance wise or durability wise? It looks like a solid gun that I'd enjoy, and that would be pretty reliable. 

Any help would be nice, I'm not trying to be a bother at all with a bunch of questions.  </TEXT>

I'm sixteen if that matters. I know that it won't magically transform me into a fuck up, but will I change at all if I do smoke pot? I really want to know what it's like, and I'm a 4.0 student, so I don't think indulging will effect me in any way. 

My dad said if I were to it's like alchohol, some people can handle it and some people can't. Is that the case? I need advice ASAP, because I was gonna ask a friend who frequently smokes if I could try it with him one of these days.  </TEXT>

After researching I finally got it to fit like I wanted in the art area. I know it's a little grainy, and I might fix that later. Just decided to get my channel fired up for the nicer weather and ready for airsoft footage. I decided to go with my main logo color and try to selective color it a bit, a little cheesy but I think it's pretty nice. Thoughts?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I recently bought my first real primary weapon, and being that all of my disposable income goes into airsoft, I now have enough money for a sidearm. 

So there's one pistol I was wondering about, and couldn't find many reviews on. The [WE 3.8 Compact] (http://www.evike.com/products/41759/).

Now I've had great luck with WE GBBR's so far, but I've heard of problems with their pistols. For the price, this gun looks pretty and for the price seems nice. Thoughts? </TEXT>

[Gryffon Dragon Spine Belt](http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.php?products_id=15137)

Otherwise the other stuff from my kit was bought from tactical gear trade but I don't recommend ordering from that website. Overpriced, shipping was high, and took a long time. 

The gun itself is a WE Open Bolt M4 totally stock. I plan to upgrade with an NPAS and new Trigger Box. Otherwise I might get an RIS and crane stock.

<TITLE> My Experience With Evike </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-03-29 19:46:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> To begin, I was **very** hesitant to order from Evike given all the horror stories I've heard here. I have to say, my whole experience has been very enjoyable. 

To start, I wanted the WE Open Bolt M4. I would usually order from ASGI, but they do not stock as many guns as Evike, or at least in the GBBR department. So after researching I didn't want another AEG, so to Evike.

At first there was a problem with our credit card (My father's credit card of course, I gave him the money and he deposited it etc.). When he was on hold for over five minutes I was certain it would be a grueling affair. Somebody picked up right away and a young man named Michael described the problem very politely. We just needed to raise our limit on the card and the gun was ordered!

Now another con I heard about with Evike was that you had to pay for shipping, but the price wasn't even that much. It was only twenty five in shipping for a gun and everything I needed to skirmish. After ordering I was informed the next **morning** that the gun was shipped. Within three or so days I got the gun. Only three days was how long it took, even with the cheapest shipping. With ASGI it was two weeks before I got my gun, and the shipping was free. Even though it's free, two weeks seems like a long wait. 

All in all, everything I've heard about Evike is wrong and my experience was very enjoyable. 10/10 would order from Evike again, and I'm not ordering from ASGI again. 

Edit: It took no longer than ten minutes for our call to be transferred. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I've been contemplating a new addition for my armory. I LOVE the look of a SCAR-H but there are no GBB SCAR-H's and I don't want just another AEG. 

So if I were to buy a VFC SCAR-H and buy a P* engine for it, what do I need to buy? I have a list of a few things, if somebody could fill me in on the mistakes that's be great.

[Engine Itself] (http://www.evike.com/products/37091)

[Tank] (http://www.evike.com/products/36570)

[Air Tube System Thingy] (http://www.evike.com/products/40898)

[Battery for FCU] (http://www.evike.com/products/37904)

[Charger] (http://www.evike.com/products/30777)

As for the [gun] (http://www.evike.com/products/32613) I was planning on ordering it before-hand separately with magazines and BB's. Is my checklist complete? Any help from seasoned P* owners would be awesome.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I have a six hundred dollar budget, and I want to jump into the GBBR world. The WE seems like a really good choice out of thr box, and of course I'd get upgrade parts from RAtech and such. I've been on Arnies Airsoft, Airsoft Society, and a plethora of forums to find reviews. I've also watched every review on YouTube. At this point I'm pretty dead-set on this gun.

Now with six hundred dollars will I have enough for the gun and magazines? If so, how many magazines should I buy? I usually play thirty minutes games at our friends private field, with short breaks for reloading and drinks.

Next quick question, anybody with past experience, what parts should be replaced? Delving into a whole new type of airsoft rifles is pretty confusing. All over I've heard, " RAtech, RAtech, RAtech."

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've read about every review on forums, and have watched every video. At this point, the Vector seems like a reasonable choice for my next order. 

The problem is that every review gives the same information. Usually it's the, "Feels great" and "Really realistic." If I wanted to use this gun for field play would it work? If not, would the Angry Gun power-up silencer be a good choice for field play? 

I have a friend that uses the KWA MP9 with no upgrades for field play, and he fares pretty well. Noting that, the Vector seems like a sensible choice for a unique GBB SMG for field play. 

Does anybody have any information, reviews, or help on whether or not this gun is good for field play? </TEXT>
