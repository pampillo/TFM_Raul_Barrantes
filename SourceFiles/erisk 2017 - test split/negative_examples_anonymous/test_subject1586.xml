<TITLE> [REQUEST] I am looking for a particular creepy website </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This came out BEFORE Warehouse 13. It was a website that people could submit content to. The format was that you were reading files on a secret asylum for dangerous supernatural objects and/or creatures. Each story was given a case number and some of them were terrifying. I seem to remember one of them was about a man sized doll like thing that always stood in the corner, but if the lights went off, or someone stopped watching the camera feed, it would move to a new location. (Pretty sure this is Pre-Weeping Angels) Any ideas? I've looked and looked and haven't come back across it. Thanks in advance for any help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As much as I want to agree, we fired him and Cincinnati gave him a place to land. Instead, we should be proud that the Ohio NFL is completely in honor of Paul Brown. Cincinnati is the only team in the AFCN that I have respect for, and the way they treated Paul Brown is the main reason. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It started originally in fiction as the symbol that the High Priestesses led by Vivian, The Lady of the Lake, wore in The Mists of Avalon. It has become, through pop culture, a symbol of women who are leaders within Wicca. It shows a person who is empowered. Not everyone uses it, but it was a powerful day when the women in our group decided to get their tattoos. Since getting hers, my woman is now the leader of the largest Wiccan church in the world: The Aquarian Tabernacle Church. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just want the people on my team to have some social media sense. They need it to be a good example for the man literally rehabilitating off of social media. I'm not all in on Johnny, my history will show me as a Hoyer fan, but I understand addiction, and social media is part of his addiction. I DO want him to succeed. This kind of stuff hinders that, imo. 

Additionally, I would be willing to bet that if West, Crow, and Duke are in a three way tie, it will come down to personal conduct, and this kind of stuff shows a person as not being mature. Will that impact the front offices opinion on him? *Shrug* I just hope for a good, powerful, responsible, team. **We Bark Together**

<TEXT> A little background. We just returned home to our house in GA. It is also a small local church with a small congregation that has been meeting there while we have been gone. It has always been haunted. You can just feel it, hear it, doors won't open, lights will go funny, etc. We have been gone, and the people watching it had vacated and it was in a level of disrepair that had me really unhappy. Two people from the folks from the church were there. A tall skinny man and his wife, who is very heavy set with long hair.  I took this establishing shot because my wife and I were considering selling it. I then thought I had caught a weird energy ribbon  on the porch. I freaked out because I thought it was an apparition. Then I realized it looked just like the man who was over, and I decided to prank  my wife and show her the "ghost" I found in this picture. She freaked out just like I did. I then told her it was just our friend and she laughed and commented that it looked so creepy we should a how it to the guy himself and tell him it was a ghost, only to reveal it is actually himself. It would be hilarious! So we did it. Only he sobered us up in return. This was actually looking in the same 2 hours, mind you. He said: "My hat's red, man. And that arm of mine is covered in tattoos" He pointed to his Nascar hat (the hat in the picture looks brown), and pulled his sleeve up to reveal a wizard tattoo. Then my wife notices the second figure crouched down in front of the lowest red circle on the wall, seeming to be sitting. But there is nothing but a shelf there, and then we noticed where the man pointing toward the door is standing was nothing but building supplies and junk. 

So, there it is. I don't know, but I know those weren't people that were here. My wife says that they look like Kenny Paradise (the tall skinny guy) and Doc Thompson (the sitting guy that looks like he is wearing glasses and blue scrubs) they both used to live here, and she says she has met them both before they died. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah. 
I would be the host of, everyday Christmas
Give Dusty a wish list. 
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt. 
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit. 

Give away a few Mercedes like, "Here, lady, have this". 
And last but not least grant somebody their last wish. 
It's been a couple months since I've single so. 
You can call me Travie Claus, minus the "Ho Ho". 

Get it, I'd probably visit where Katrina hit. 
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did. 
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid. 
Everywhere I go I'mma have my own theme music. 

I'll be playing basketball with the President
Dunking on his delegates. 
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette. 
Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it. 
But keep the fives, twenties, tens and bens completely separate. 
And yeah I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it. 
I'll probably take whatever is left and just split it up. 
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks. 
And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was. 
Eating good, sleeping soundly. 
I know we all have a similar dream. 
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet and put it in the air and sing.

<TEXT> "The only coach in the NFL not connected to Paul Brown is Chip Kelly"

The funny thing about that in my opinion, is no coach reminds me of Paul Brown, with his ability to create new ways to play the game while skirting the rules, like Chip Kelly did with the remote controlled car during mini camp. Brown would have pulled that same card if they had portable video and remote controlled cars in 1950. </TEXT>

Then the lower half of it was yellow to orange, or orange to yello, but the difference between the red and the rest of the body was dramatic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was driving down to the boat launch, and near the bend in the road, this bird was standing in middle of the street. It had no black on its body. If a Phoenix was actually a canary, then this little candle flame of a bird was a Phoenix. It was so neat and as an avid bird watcher, I screamed when I saw it, because I had never seen anything like it. I couldn't get my phone out before it flew away. I have been on WhatABird and all over Google and I can't find it. Any ideas?

Starting as an intern on Special Teams and working to create a true culture of veterans, rookies and alumni working together to coach, lead, and play the Browns into a perennial winner? I hate to say anything ever about the Stealers, but Ozzy Newsome is amazing, and he is amazing because of his love not only for the game, but the organization he works for. They win because everyone still works together to make things happen. From the newest guy, to the most seasoned HoF-er, they still work with the team and add their energy to make it strong.

<TEXT> I really hope we get people like Ike Taylor retiring from our team. His article on BR about his outlook on moving into the next arena of football (coaching) is inspiring. "I never wanted to be anywhere else. Yes I'm retiring, but that doesn't mean I'm done. My next job for the Steelers can be without cleats. In an office. I can start at the bottom and work my way up. Just being here to help these guys become great is what I live for. Seeing my guys go from 4-5-6 on the depth chart to 1-2-3 is an amazing feeling. Do you need something? I'm the guy. Can I run to Walmart and grab it before the game? I'm 
 that kind of person" 

It's that love for his team, and the desire to be part of what makes it great, that has melted the black and yellow when I see him, and reveals the kind of player I want on the Browns. 

Here's hoping that the culture within First Energy has sweetened and tightened up enough that we begin breeding players with this outlook at the end of their careers. </TEXT>

But flanking the Goddess, Herself, [are the two cans of Bernie Beer](http://imgur.com/vUozM3e), because obviously my man knew I would want to keep one unopened, and would also have to taste its Kosar-ie contents. Great trade! Thanks again /u/ohheyeverybody I hope you like what you have coming! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a big fan of them both. I think that Crowell will be our goal line RB because he can always find 2 yards, where T-West will have more overall yards, because when he does break one off, He. Takes. Off.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ha Ha! Only someone who didn't do their homework could come up with an article as far off base as this one is. No research!

#1 Johnny's parents are extremely glad that he was drafted by the Browns. Not only has he gotten the help he needed but the Browns have set up a support system to surround him upon his release. Jimmy   Dee Haslam are oil people   so are Johnny's parents, they are friends that have a lot in common. The Haslam's are looking out for Johnny's best interest   the quote that backs this up is Coach Pet saying that, JM the person is the first thing that needs addressed. Imagine that, an organization that actually cares for the health   welfare of their employees. Not to mention that Coach Pet has taken time to go visit him. Being there for him   not turning his back on him in his time of need   surely the HC   QB are going to become close after this.

#2 Going through rehab myself I know what the things are needed upon his release   first   foremost is a great support system. The Browns have done that in both areas, work   personally. 1.They assemble an offensive coaching staff with the ability to transform these college spread QB's into the NFL. This is proved by each coach's history of developing QB's. Coach Flip called his offensive staff an all-star staff as his phone was ringing off the wall during the period he was doing coaching candidate interviews. Do your research like I have   you will see this, just read negative articles written by others that don't understand what is going on   we get articles like this. Whoever is the Browns QB is going to come to us from college   if you have the ability to transform a college spread QB into the NFL you will have a bigger selection to choose from as most college QB's are spread QB's   this won't change anytime soon so the NFL better learn real quick on how to coach them or they will have a T-shirt with 20 some QB's listed on it as well. This basically is a cutting edge staff put together with a whole lot of thought. Each area in a QB's development has a specialist that will work with him in that area. Plumber's do the plumbing, electricians do the electric, labor's do the grunt work etc etc. They have JM covered in all areas pertaining to football. They even have come up with a 24/7 plan for his week. How he will spend his time off the field as well.

The next part of the support system is a sponsor, someone he can call when he feels like he could relapse. Someone who cares   has his best interest at heart. Someone he can relate to   tell his deepest darkest secrets. The sponser is never a partner in crime, not one of his party buddy's would qualify as they weren't really friends, but friends just wanting something from him. Enter Josh McCown for a 3 fold purpose. He has the ability to be the bridge QB temporarily on the field, the desire to go into coaching when he lays the ball down is a plus for him as he is getting on the job training so to speak that is going help him when he does retire. If you heard Josh's comments about his desire to work with Johnny   when it's time for him to turn the ball over to Johnny or another QB he won't have a problem doing that. His own ego being put to the side for the best of others comes right out of the Bible. He is an example for Manziel on how he needs to feel. The perfect sponsor for Johnny is what Josh is. Not only that, but their home towns are only about 30 miles a part, they can relate in more areas then one   those jet ride homes with party boys will now be filled with the McCown family rather then his bling family. This goes deep sports fans   well thought out by a team that actually does care for not only his well being but others as well. Take note Josh Gordon if you are reading this. Johnny is leading you   providing an example for your good as well. Listen to his play call as once Johnny has gone through it, his next step in rehab is to sponsor others   help them get through it. The whole situation is looking good   the Browns are trying their hardest to be a team that can handle any type player. Whether they be on the wild side or the goody 2 shoes side, they will now be able to not be guided by fear in the draft, but rather could develop players like Dorial Green Beckham. Fear has lowered his draft stock   the Browns could benefit from that like the Bengals did with Vontaze Burfict who fell completely out of the draft because of the fear associated with him. The Bengals had a mentor for him in place that got his attention. That is what separates the AFCN from other divisions, they actually care about their players   don't care what ill informed writers have to say.

As far as surrounding him with receivers, that is not the first thing you do when building a team. When building a team you start with a plan. The Franchise QB has strength's   weaknesses that can become strength's with the right coaching in it's due time. But once a QB or your idea of a QB is established then you can draft according to their strengths. As the QB grows you may have to tweak your style   New England is a perfect example of this as their offense changes pretty regular. The OL is the most important area to support your franchise QB   the Browns have that, may need tweaked but the core is place. Then the running game follows,   the WR's after that, drafted or traded for or a FA, basically they can come from anywhere.

For Pete's sake this is only March   we won't know who is destined to come to the Browns until September, then we won't know how successful they were until the end of the season. Some of us can look at that vacant lot   envision the mansion on the hill. Then again, some can't   that results in articles like this guy wrote!

Meet Johnny's sponsor here! QB, Josh McCown, "My Heart is to Please God" Don't forget, Johnny is in a faith based rehab program.

<TEXT> So, I will tell you what I told a good friend: *"If the bill goes through, this will be part of what we will be coaching Wiccans to accept as part of their rights, and then we will start dealing with winning the court cases, and that will cement our rights. Change can be made, and if they give us a framework of law that they think is going to give them exclusive religious rights, then what we are going to do is set our beliefs into that framework, and we legally should have the same expansion of our rights.* **[EDIT: Forgot this part and it posted without me getting it put in:]** *Wicca has full government recognition because of the umbrella 501(c)3 that the ATC holds. What the ATC is doing, and does, is inform the legislature and our members of what Wiccan rights will be under their new proposed law changes. It is outside of the scope of the ATC's 501(c)3 to try to create new legislature or endorse or denounce existing legislature"* </TEXT>

<TEXT> The ATC is pointing out where the new rights will expand into Wiccan territory. If the Government passes the bill, then new rights open up. Including rights surrounding marriage, taxes, and worship. Much like what the Christian Right thought would happen with allowing prayer in Louisiana public schools. They didn't realize other religions would have new expanded rights under the law allowing them to host public prayer, as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We run a non-Abrahamic denomination, church. We have just had our founder die, and the torch has passed. We were cleaning the church after he passed, and found this framed picture wrapped in a blanket in the back, often locked, closet in the bathroom. After showing it to our archivist, she came to the conclusion that it was real pencil and real watercolor, and the "foxing" on the paper would denote that it would be from around the 40's or 50's. Her next suggestion was to take it to the University of Washington. I brought it here, first. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ALSO, it is an imaginary equator that runs through the galaxy, much like there is an imaginary line through the middle of an Astrological Natal Chart. Our sun turns around the center of our galaxy the same as the Earth turns around the sun, and a person could map that two dimensionally on a piece of paper as a circle with 12 pie segments. Our earth moves through 3 segments every season in a circle, eventually coming back to a starting point. In the western world, we consider this January 1st. The same exists on a macrocosmic level for the galaxy. Only instead of it taking 30 days per segment, it takes 2100-2600 years. And instead of calling it a 'month' we call it an 'age'. [I'm sure there is a leap epoch in there to make up for the math.](http://media.giphy.com/media/10yeJtpwWcFrAA/giphy.gif) </TEXT>

<TEXT> God: My child, I use evolution to create that which I want to come into existence. Time is an operating principle of the universe that even I cannot escape. It takes time and intent to create. When you want to create something, you have to get the tools together and work with the materials to create that which you have imagined. I must do the same. So do not fear it there bones under the grass, or that there are stars above with the promise of other races. I have many pallets, and many tools and I take my time to make everything perfect. Because every creation I make is special, and important. Just like you. </TEXT>

1: We Bark Together

2: Seattle

3: I cannot do international. I am a minister and my personal funds are way limited.

4: I am a vet of reddit secret santa, but I have not done Drafts for the Draft.

5: After getting really drawn into the craziness of the new Browns energy, I had to find a bigger community. Being a displaced Clevelander is hard. 10 years in ATL, and now I live (hopefully forever) outside of Seattle in the mountains. I am wearing a Browns shirt and orange shorts in San Fran in China Town as we speak.

<TEXT> I was recently having a conversation with a friend of mine about this. He was upset that Trestman went to the Ravens. He was talking about how he should come home to the Browns, the history of Trestman in Cleveland, and eventually why we cant get those guys to come back. It finally hit me during that conversation. As much as I hate the Ravens when you ask the old timers to come back and help the Browns, their friends arent in Berea. When they think of the old times, they think of Ozzy Newsome and the staff of the Browns Pre-95. All of Trestmans friends from the old days are in Baltimore. One day we will be back to being a contender, but I fear that we wont ever be what we were. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was pulling for Trestman to be our HC. I REALLY think we lucked out with Pettine, but think we have a spot on our roster for him to be the OC or QB Coach. I like him, his history with Cleveland, and his resume from the CFL. We could use some of that old school Browns energy back in the building. Especially when it has left and had success abroad..

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am going to get one more jersey before we change to the new style. I already have a Seal Brown '40' that was given to me with "Hillis" scraped off and my name stenciled on as a gift (First Jersey) I then bought a Seal Brown Cribbs '16' and a Seal Brown Haden '23'. I pretty much know that I want a Thomas '73'. The question is, do I want to go Seal Brown again, or do I go with my first White Jersey? 

I want the Seal Brown because I worry we wont have them next year, and I think I will still be able to get a white jersey next year. But I dont have a white jersey, yet, and I think Thomas might be really sick in White. 

Suggestions? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am the most badass epic legendary neighbor. Here is my story:

I moved into the most beautiful neighborhood near Atlanta, GA. Historic Druid Hills across from Emory University. My house was perfect in so many ways. I had my own room with attached smoking porch, a gourmet kitchen, roommates that I loved, music, fun, parties, pets. It was perfect. Until 10pm every night. I lived next door to this horrible old woman and her 90 year old mother. We shared a driveway that split at the end into each of our yards. Once noise ordinance set in, the police calls would begin. It was a never ending, revolving door of police visit after police visit.

Listening to classical music and cooking a late dinner? Police. 

Laughing at a game of Apples to Apples and watching Craig Ferguson? Police. 

But the night that changed me was the night I came home from working 3 jobs at 11pm. I was, in this order, a Lumberjack, Mexican Restaurant Waiter, Gormet Pizza Chef for Everybody's Pizza  and my day started at 6am.

All I wanted was a milk shake. Sometimes all of life's problems can be solved, at least in the moment, with a milkshake. All of the sudden I hear the 3 hard knocks of an irate police officer. I answer the door holding the blender.

"Hello, Officer. What is it this time?

He points to my blender. 

"Your blender"

I must have looked at him in a really messed up way, because he gave me this 'Don't shoot the messanger' look with his hands up, and said

"Look. Just be quiet over here. I sat outside and you aren't doing anything technically wrong, but she is going to call us every time she hears you and we are 
going to have to respond"

So, being at the end of my rope, I asked a question. 

"What time does ordinance lift?"

"5am" he replied, and turned on his heel to leave. I nodded, closed the door, hand stirred the rest of my milk shake, went to bed, and set my alarm.

5am came slower than Christmas. Once my alarm went off I sat up, combed my hair, brushed my teeth, got dressed, and removed my trumpet from its case. 

*it should be mentioned here that OP played one quarter of a year of trumpet in 5th grade.*

I made my way out to where the split in our driveways began. Standing just on my side of the property, I faced her house, and began the most discordant, obnoxious, sonically discombobulating, racket I could muster. After a solid 2 minutes, the meanest, morning faced, most mad, vile, fist clenched, woman you have ever seen comes charging out of her house at me. I can tell that she has probably just gotten off the phone with the police, and has been informed that noise ordinance lifts at 5am

"STOP IT STOP IT STOP IT!!!! YOU STOP THAT RIGHT NOW"

At this point she is stomping and spitting and her hair is starting to unspring from her head, and I put my trumpet politely in her face and blow it as hard as I can while attempting to play as close to a 26/33 cadance as I can get. She runs back into the house and a few minutes later comes back outside. I like to imagine she called the police again to tell them what happened and they  politely told her to flake off, hung up the phone and laughed to each other about the field this lady was reaping from her actions.

Once again she beelines over to me and tries to take my trumpet. I pull it away and jut my face towards hers.

"If you touch my trumpet I'll have you arrested. You want to own the night. I own the fucking day"

And for a solid week my trumpets calls could be heard all the way to the CDC.

<TEXT> I think that this article nails it on the head. This front office/coaching staff is amazing. The movement to ManChild was perfect in its timing. We had enough time to see what he could do. Even after that shutout, the choice to play him again was the right decision. Connor Shaw was the correct decision for the Ravens. I'm more than satisfied with our infrastructure and the choices they have made. I trust, for the first time in modern history, that they will field the best decisions available to them. </TEXT>

A loser of an island that can't get off my Browns fast enough. I pray that he does something so inappropriate in the off season that the front office has no choice but to fire him. Shaw takes the helm and  takes us to 3 super bowls. We only win one, but we beat Denver for the AFC title each time.  I also hope it makes you see how horrible he is. I also hope he goes to Oakland.  I also hope you have a dream tonight about having sex with your grandma. Sorry to be so vague about my feelings. 'Nite. </TEXT>

If the only time he hit the field was a clutch situation, then the odds are in his favor of being really good, plus, (and I am officially excited to see him play) Johnny's GONNA get hurt with his style. It's not 'if', but 'when'. He was lucky to not have gotten hurt on that TD scramble. He took a crazy hit to the side during the play. Plus we know that Hoyer is better than any backup or starter since we got back in '99, so he's a safe bet. If he can't get a starting job somewhere, I hope we sign him as a backup. </TEXT>

I'm probably going to take that picture and post it every time. Not because it's pornographic, but because we all earned it, and deserve to bask in the gifts given to us by our supporters. You will PROBABLY not see any more pics from me on the subject, but I also cant promise that another girl from my church isnt going to be like "Hey! you beat the Colts! Lemme take a boob picture in a cowboy hat for your sub!" I wouldnt have the heart to not take and share the unique bounty that being a winning Browns Fan on this sub generates. I'm sorry if you are offended. And I'm not annoyed by your opinions. I'm simply down hearted by the energy that has swept over this sub, recently. People attacking other subs, attacking our own members, and a general air of "We are a serious ball club sans shenanigans" has me a little down, but your opinions are sacred, because they are your opinions. Go Browns </TEXT>

<TEXT> They aren't mine. I only captured them on film. I agree with people not asking for boob pics, but if a female Browns fan can't take a picture of her ample bosom in celebration of a win, then I dont know how we can call this THE Browns subreddit. If people were hounding folks for pictures, I could understand, but freely given Brownie Boobies being down voted when it's part of our history, dare I say, part of the very lifeblood of our membership; like beer and bad memes and down voting to punish people that are different. It's part of us. Dont hate. Participate. </TEXT>

He did better than I thought in certain cases, and worse than I thought he would be in others. Good stuff from him though, and I'm glad he got his start.

<TEXT> Let's look at someone comparable to Gordon: Megatron. They have this figured out with Megatron:

*"If you were watching ESPN Sport Science last October, you saw what a freak of nature Calvin Johnson actually is. Between his 6'5" height and his 6'10" wingspan, he has an 8'8" standing reach. Add in a 45" vertical jump and you've got a guy that can cover over 4,000 cubic feet, all from a standing position. Add it up: Calvin covers an incredible area, more than an average two-car garage."*

Well Gordon is 3 inches shorter with a 36" jump and a 6'8" wingspan. I would put that somewhere closer to 3500 cubic feet total access to teh ball when thrown to him. He totally will have more chances to catch the ball than the 5'10" receiver corps. 

ALGEBRAIC!

And Hoyer fucking rules. Today included. *Snoogins* </TEXT>

<TITLE> BREAKING: Pierre Claveloux 'Pete Pathfinder' Davis has Died </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-01 05:02:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Today at 6pm Pacific Time, Pierre Claveloux Pete Pathfinder Davis was taken across the veil. He was surrounded by loved ones, and went peacefully in his bed. Today, on our most holy day, when the barrier between the Worlds was at its thinnest, and on the 35th anniversary of the founding of his lifes work, The Aquarian Tabernacle Church; our Grandmother Hekate, Patron Goddess of our Order came across and brought home with her one of her most devoted sons. Founder of the Aquarian Tabernacle Church, Panegyria Magazine, Spiral Scouts, The Pagan Information Network, and Woolston-Steen Theological Seminary, Petes contribution to Wicca, and Pagan rights can never be overstated. From prison ministries, to Veterans rights, and his ability to standardize our faith through the Government, Petes legacy, and the freedoms enjoyed from his actions will be felt throughout the duration of Wicca on Earth.

Pete Pathfinder: Born on Ostara, 1937. Crossed into the Summerlands on Samhain, 2014.

Please hold your phone calls until Nov. 2nd and give the family and church time to grieve. If you would like to post your condolences for the time being, please go to: [The ATC Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/ATCIntl)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I upset some folks by posting something from my twitter account earlier, about Joe Haden being my favorite #23 over Lebron. (which made some people get really upset. said it messed with the integrity of the sub to post from personal twitter accounts) Then they assured me the downvoting would end when I removed the post (which is a little like a reddit gestapo) that it was only because of the twitter association. So now I post this, and the downvoting continues. Browns fans use the down vote as a punishment, as well as an opinion. *shrug* It's okay. I'm stoked for my new jersey and I love the Browns :) *EDIT: As proven by the the post below about not wanting knock off jersey posts, even though every other post about people getting Browns gear at a good deal has been uproaringly upvoted*

Some taxes might make it to the schools, but that's not the same.  I did find something about the Lebron Family Foundation that I will read up on. Thank you for making me dig deeper.

And the school he was supposed to attend had an expose done on them where they found they were still using text books from the 50's and they showed these holes in the ceilings of the class rooms with black mold in them. Akron is a cesspool. I can understand him wanting to never help out the scummiest town I have ever been in, I just think it's wrong of him. He's part of that scum, even if he did float to the top.

Our rule is "A community for Cleveland Browns Fans" I think the downvoting because of it being from twitter is ridiculous. The voting isnt a popularity marker, it's supposed to be about content. If you dont like me telling LeBrown, on a Browns reddit, that I like Haden more than him, then downvote the hell out of me. If you dont like that I linked it from a website that you dont approve of, then downvoting is just shamevoting and should be against our rules of good conduct.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disliked him before he went pro. I am from Kent, OH. I watched LeBron grow up on my local television networks. I constantly heard the reports about him getting Escalades paid for by the school he was being scholarshipped into, while the school he left was using books from the 1950's and kids were being removed with black mold sickness. I've never heard article one about him putting his money back into those school districts. Maybe if he used his money to help the people that he left behind, then I would have a change of heart. Coming back to CLE and promising a championship is like going to the sun and promising cotton candy. It's no given that it is going to happen. He stepped all over the people that manicured him and removed him from poverty, and now he is back, and It's all chill? I just need more from him. I need him to use his leg up to create a new standard for the kids coming from the same place he did. If he has done that, and I missed it, (I do live in Washington now) I am all about changing my tune. I just think he's kind of a selfish brat. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have called "Moving the Chains" on SiriusXM and told them this idea. They pretty much blew me off, but I still think that it's a good idea. I think bringing in as many of the old Browns players that want to mentor and work with the team as possible is a goodt idea. I realize some people cant teach, or coach, and that it is a totally different skill set than being a player. I also think it will bring the energy of "Play Life a Brown" further into fruition when these young players begin finding some new favorite players in the Browns of Old. Wanting to prove yourself in front of people you respect is a great motivator. *EDIT: And Thank You* </TEXT>

*That's not meant to crap on the Browns, but the coaching staff in Cleveland is doing an amazing job coaching up the talent on the roster. Brian Hoyer at quarterback, no Alex Mack, a rotating backfield, no Josh Gordon and yet they're competitive in a loaded AFC North. Let's get Mike Pettine and Kyle Shanahan on some Coach/Assistant Coach of the Year ballots.*

*The rest of the season won't be easy, given the schedule and talent issues, but I'm past betting against this team. ***The Browns are one of the NFL's grittiest teams***, and winning ugly, cold, muddy football games in November and December seems very realistic."* </TEXT>

You are arguing that Colts injury is what made us cut him, and THAT seems highly unlikely that a concussion will cause a team to let you go.

Is this how they treated you when you made a mistake as a child? I can imagine. Parents and adults can be really cruel. Lots of people have played through a concussion, and plenty of peoples parents havent come into the locker room like it was a Texas High School and yelled at the coaches. We have lawyers for that sort of thing in the pros. Again, I'm sorry for your need to be so mean, and Go Browns! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, First off I will disappoint everyone, but hopefully I will make up for it with the story. I didn't get pictures. I was so busy this weekend that I got 10 hours of sleep from Thursday to Sunday, and 5 of them came from Saturday to Sunday. I have [this picture](http://imgur.com/8GIvVbZ) that I took. It shows the concept, but I tried to upload it before the event, and my phone wouldn't let me. My menu was really simple. I'll tell you the entire production for the final nights feast. 

We had what I named Harvest Feast Pork (not very original, but it went with the theme)  I took my trimmed, 2-3 inch cubed pieces of pork leg, and braised them with salt an pepper. Then I added used olive oil, and garlic instead of onion in my mirapoix (so celery, carrot, and garlic). To deglaze I used white wine (chardonnay) and apple juice. I then added a rosemary/parsley bouquet garni. I put it in at 350 for 4 hours. When the meat came out, I used corn starch as a thickener.  Earlier in the day, my morning crew had peeled, cored, and sliced into quarters, 5 bags of apples and pears. I then panned them, covered them in cinnamon, and made a slurry of apple juice, water, cinnamon, and sugar. I poured that over the top and set to cook it for 2 1/2 hours at 350. I also learned how to use convection ovens this weekend (that was cool) and I made near to 90 squash that we served in quarters. I had also made a "Hobbit Stew" earlier and put up in the freezer for the feast. It was a homemade Veggie stock (carrots, celery, leek, garlic, ginger, rosemary, thyme, parsley) and then I used it as the base for turnips, parsnips, rutabagas, yellow/purple/red potatoes, sweet potatoes, purple yams, and Asian yams which I served a ladle of to everyone. Then corn on the cob cooked in water with a little sugar and apple juice, as well as pretzel rolls were the sides. It was an amazing feast. We had pumpkin pie (store bought) to accompany everything and southern style sweet tea to beat the band. 

We had 2 other dinners that were made in the same exact way except they were beef, and the bouquet garni was rosemary, and then thyme on the second one.  It was wonderful and I could never have done it without you. I will scour the pictures coming out from the event and see if anyone took pictures of their food. Since that is all instagram seems to be used for, I am hoping it is inevitable that I can find some. Thank you again and I am a life long follower of /r/cooking from here on out!

MORE EDIT: It's important to live an examined life where you realize that the world creates itself in your image, everyday. I once read a great sentence: "Religion isn't just what you think about things, it's what you do about things, and how you do it". This is what it means to understand your spiritual path, and to understand that the universe is creating itself for you every moment.*

<TEXT> Browns fan here. Totally bantering, but as a rule I try not to ever vote on other teams lists, and I havent thrown a slur, but some really aggro people from this list go to instantly accusing folks of "Vote Brigading" (which is a cool term I had never heard before) even though some of us follow reddiquette. Not saying I havent voted, just that I vote consciously and not to just punish a post, and I reiterate: I try to follow a rule of not voting on other subs. But are we really telling on each other and getting in a twist? We are telling the REDDIT MODS? Really? We are supposed to be like Goku and Vegita. (We're Goku) and we love to hate each other, and we take our lumps from each other, and we do it with pride and honor. *EDIT I can hate you, but I actually tell other teams fans when they get shitty about you guys, that they need to shut their mouths, because they dont know you well enough to hate you like that.* Come on. Brothers who kick the shit out of each other, but going to mom and tattling? We're better than that. Let's handle things in house and just duke it out when need be. Buck up.

Mirepoix was carrot, garlic, and mushroom (onion allergy coming to the event and didnt have celery) and then did a Bouquet Garni of thyme rosemary and sage. It turned out amazing.

<TEXT> The Destroyer is holding strong over his mentor this season in Fantasy. I have Hoyer AND Brady on my team. So I was trying to figure out if I should go with Hoyer as the beast he is, or Brady as the beast he is supposed to be but hasnt been at all this year? So I asked [The Guru] (http://imgur.com/VbOlabc). Das Guru doesnt even have Hoyer ranked (BS) and he has 6 fantasy points on average more than Brady on the year. And their suggestion is Brady over Hoyer. The lack of a ranking is mind blowing to me. </TEXT>

We revel in your legal battles, we love that you have the reputation for being thieves, murderers, drug addicts, and adulterers, and we like it when you have to play without your stars.  (Other teams play that game too, but you guys make it into an "Art" lulz) And it was a serious sign of respect that you should recognize, because in a different time, Pita would have been covered in broken bottles, and D Batteries to put the cherry on top of his injury.

<TEXT> I [told the Ravens sub](http://www.reddit.com/r/ravens/comments/26mas5/ravens_4th_round_draft_pick_rb_lorenzo_taliaferro/chsepzu) when their people started getting in trouble (specifically this was about Lorenzo Taliaferro) that it was Karma. I even wrote a story, and was downvoted and told I was a stupid Browns Fan, and then I was accused of "Running to my sub for upvotes" (which I was too new to know that was a thing). I am reposting my story here, again, in light of Ray Rice, and the Raven fan-base can Dawg my Bone if they dont like it. The truth stings:

**My Story of The Ravens, Art Model, and the Devil**:*The Ravens were created after Baltimore made a deal with the Devil. So many angry prayers smoldered through the earth into the bowels of the Devils play place. Day and night he was assaulted with the lamentations of the lost souls, pining for their Colts. Finally the Son of Light heard a call that would end his suffering: Art Modell was weak, and was begging for release. So Lucifer, that wily old devil, whispered into the ears of each of the most powerful people in Baltimore and within the Browns, and a deal was struck! That deal included 2 SB, and safety from any lasting harm that may come against any of his players and original staff that took part in the move. In return the Browns would move to Baltimore, and in a seperate trade for his immortal soul Belichick obtained his own deal, but that will be a story for another day. And so it was that a faithful and historic football city the likes of Cleveland was stripped of their team, and Baltimores prayers were answered. But oldschool fans know in their hearts which side answered their prayers that day. It is within each true original Baltimore Colts fan. That seed. That knowledge that it was not a godsend. It came from the other direction. And they know when he came to collect. The Super Bowl in the Super Dome. That light failure was no fluke. That was the Prince of Darkness showing up to watch the final moments of his deal. You won. And so did he. And now that Devils deal Baltimore made has come around to the other side, as all deals eventually do. I have a feeling that you will be seeing much more of this as the balance exherts itself. Safe travels, friends.* *edit:formatting*

<TEXT> Yes we lost, but we lost with 24 unanswered points in the last 4 seconds to a field goal. Yes we have things to fix, but our receiving corps isnt really one of them in the way that we thought. With Tate down the Ground Pound that is West and Crowell was AMAZING amassing TD's and Yards against the vaulted LaBeau DEF like they were a collegiate team. HOYER THE DESTROYER broke bad in the second half in a serious way. This isnt a bullshit team, and it's gonna get easier from here. *EDIT: Spelling and GO BROWNS*

<TEXT> No. That was as a flop, or being scared, or actually being payed by the Steelers on the sly.  Did you SEE how fast his head whipped around to watch the play unfold?

Since it doesn't get me just over flowing buckets of upvotes, (as you can see on both your post and this one) maybe I'm just doing it because I enjoy sharing, and not because I am garnering some kind of up vote support.

<TEXT> I agree with you. I also have been a big fan of him as a pickup since the Draft. My prediction was that Hoyer would get bumped out for Manzeil, then around game 8 I see him getting creamed on a scramble, and then they bring in Shaw and he lights it up not only that game, but for the rest of the,  year. He starts in Johnny comes back at the beginning of '15, plays 2 games, they bring Shaw back, he takes us to the Super Bowl.

<TEXT> As a matter of fact, there is even a bar on the SIM. If its connected to the Browns Reddit, we might even be able to get players to make avatars and come talk. They do that with musicians all the time. Trent Reznor will come on play a live show and have his computer set up in the room and it live relays his performance. We could use FRAPS and record the interviews and throw it onto youtube and feature it here. It would be cool to have the first Second Life Browns Backers group. *spelling* </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I walked into the bank today, I live in Seattle, and there is this blonde girl that works behind the counter who is a Steelers fan. The very first time that I saw her I joked "Aren't you say Seattlite? Why the Steelers gear?" She looked at me and said 

"I don't give a f*** I like the Steelers they are a good team they win I don't care about the Seahawks I mean I'm a fan I guess but I'm a Steelers fan first."

 After that she wouldn't look at me or wait on me at all so I just went in there today and had to put in a deposit and she was the only one there. I walked up and I said "I'm sorry I give you crap about being a Steelers fan." And she said

 "I don't give a s*** you're just mad cuz we have six and you have one!"

 To which I realized she thought i was a Seahawk fan, so I replied "I'm a Browns fan." Her demeanor instantly changed; a big smile crossed her face and she said 

"oh, well you got 0." 

And I said "yep we've got 0 but I guess we can at least hate the Ravens together"

 and she said "f*** the Ravens" 

and I said "f*** the Ravens" 

and she said "and the Browns" 

I said "hey f*** the Steelers" 

and we both laughed and we said "f*** Cincinnati" 

and then now we're friends and she smiled as I walked out the door. And that is what it means to have the best rivalry in all of the NFL. And I got to cuss in the bank. </TEXT>

<TITLE> So, you're one of those New Browns fans? Heres a little list to help you out! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-11 23:08:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So you've decided to be a Browns fan? Well, there's a couple things that you need to know to successfully navigate wearing the Orange and Brown. 
 
Number 1: "Don't worry, there's always next year." Now I know what you're thinking: "Why would he be saying there's always next year? We haven't even started this year." This is part of the sacred Tao that is being a Browns fan. It is a mantra that many of us have prayed over, because we know, possibly more than anyone,  that there is no such thing as a sure thing.

Number 2: "We are the hipsters of football fans" I said it. We as Browns fans only support teams that won championships before the institution of the Sellout Bowl. I mean Superbowl. *dons orange and brown flannel shirt, horn rimmed glasses and knit cap*

Number 3: That being said learn who Paul Brown, Jim Brown, Lou Grouza and Otto Graham are.

Number 4: If you're one of the new fans who is going to have the pleasure/privilege/luck of attending home games at FirstEnergy Stadium, be ready to be part of a stadium where you cant have glass bottles! That's right Browns fans like to throw bottles onto the field and the stadium banned their use after one such incident. We are rowdy.  Its fun. 

Number 5: You also can't bring in items from outside, into the stadium. After we could not throw bottles somebody decided to throw batteries.

Number 6: If you get to tailgate before the game in the Muni lot, and you see a large bus. with the ground completely saturated with water in front of it, just keep walking forward and don't contemplate the situation.
 
Number 7: Cornholing is no longer just a sexual slur.

Number 8: F*** the Steelers. (Like for real. We dont like those guys. Ravens[ratbirds] either)

Number 9: Its a Brownie, not an Elf

Number 10: All contributions to televised football aside, we know that Art Modell is actually a multi time failed business man who is the only person to ever bankrupt a football team. 

Number 11: The plain orange helmet is sacred. 

Number 12: Next Year Is Coming. 

I'm sure others may have more to add below, but this is a gift from me, 31 year Browns fan, to you as a bright eyed new dawg ready to get a bark or two out in the pound this year. Welcome. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think your text length was just fine. I have no problem with off field antics that dont hurt anybody. People live life and they make mistakes and people deal with pain and recreation differently. I think in the grand scheme of things we have a guy who likes to party hard when he's not succeeding at football spectacularly, and a relatively low key guy who smokes weed and blows it up on the gridiron.  I dont think either of them are being detrimental to the team, currently. I do have a bias: I live in Washington and am witnessing how benign the transition has been of legalized marijuana. One day I think this will be a highly antiquated conversation. I think it will be within the next decade that we will see major changes, and probably sooner than that. Now IM sorry for the text wall! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel about the Steelers the way Vegita feels about Goku (Dragon Ball Z reference). He can hate him, but you dont know shit about him, so stay back. If anyone is going to dis the Steelers, its us. We have to play them 2 times every year, forever. There is a hidden honor there. We hate them the way brothers who have had a falling out hate. If anyone else trash talks them, I get offended and think "They dont have any right to trash talk the Steelers. I have a right to trash those bastards, but your Charger lovin' ass can stuff it." With that said, we have to honor our opponents that deserve honoring,  and celebrate their lives once they pass. They put up with our bickering, and they understood us better than anyone else in the league. And for that I honor a man who took his team to 4 Super Bowls. Be at peace,  Chuck. Steelers Heaven is undoubtedly welcoming you in grand style. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Remove the teachers and make them Mentors. Demand excellence in Math, Science, Social Studies, Sports and the Arts, but dont force a curriculum. Give the children choices and allow them to create the education they want. Make it a forum where the kids choose the direction they want thwir studies to go. Have American History, but allow the child to decide what parts they want to learn. If they dont care about the Dust Bowl, but spend 4 years learning about Ohio Railroads, the only thing that does is make them a walking resource on a subject that they are passionate about, instead of wasting 4 years teaching them a little bit about everything they dont care to remember. Don't make them read "The Wind in the Willows", make them have to read something that interests them. Be there as a guide to help them find knowledge for themselves, and ditch standardized testing. Train the Mentors in how to give a written assessment,  and then give the kids a real grade that isnt attached to a letter, but to a document that details their attitude and accomplishments and if they have learned the fundamentals to move to the next level of resources, then syart suggesting things that seem to flow with what they already seem to be doing. Every reading assignment is from a famous American author? Suggest some Tom Wolfe. The student seems to gravitate toward modern sci-fi? Suggeat some classic Asimov to round out their education. That is the difference between a Mentor and a Teacher. A Mentor helps you discover the world in which you can flourish and find things that bolster your knowledge. A Teacher stands in front of you and helps you learn a set of knowledge that is pre planned by someone who makes curriculums for a living. Also, as a parent of 3 "No Child Left Behind" age children, I would ditch it so fast. 2 of them dont read well, and the third only does because he plays video games. That program is "Leave All the Children Behind and Forget About Their Whole Generation" but that might be a little political there at the end. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was homeless for a good part of my tween and teen years. I am also from Ohio. Well, it's cold in Ohio, and being homeless doesn't confine itself to when it's warm. This makes for a lot of cold winter nights; lonely and alone. I used to talk to the Moon and Orion every night in the winter, that they were out. The problem is Orion is only out in the cold months,  and I was homeless and in need of someone to talk to all the time, so when I turned 18 I got him tattooed in dots and lines on my forearm. This way I had him with me always.  I got the idea when I saw a friend at a festival with him tattooed on his ankle. My friend is a Sagittarius,  and so his Orion is the Archer version.  Mine is the Lion and Club version.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a person who loves the Browns, and as a native of Kent, Ohio (Kent State Flashes) my favorite is my flair: #16 Mr. Joshua Cribbs. A walk on, home town, Special Teams, sensation that many believe caused the new blocking rules on kick returns; forever letting it be known in Cleveland as "The Cribbs Rule" because of how it dramatically decreased his effectiveness. But this does not change how I feel about him. He would have been a shoe in for Canton if he had won a ring, and may still, but either way, Cribbs is my boy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Ravens were created after Baltimore made a deal with the Devil. So many angry  prayers smoldered through the earth into the bowels of the Devils play place. Day and night he was assaulted with the lamentations of the lost souls, pining for their Colts. Finally the Son of Light heard a call that would end his suffering: Art Modell was weak, and was begging for release. So Lucifer, that wily old devil, whispered into the ears of each of the most powerful people in Baltimore and within the Browns, and a deal was struck! That deal included 2 SB, and safety from any lasting harm that may come against any of his players and original staff that took part in the move. In return the Browns would move to Baltimore, and in a seperate trade for his immortal soul Belichick obtained his own deal, but that will be a story for another day. And so it was that a faithful and historic football city the likes of Cleveland was stripped of their team, and Baltimores prayers were answered. But oldschool fans know in their hearts which side answered their prayers that day.  It is within each true original Baltimore Colts fan. That seed. That knowledge that it was not a godsend. It came from the other direction. And they know when he came to collect. The Super Bowl in the Super Dome. That light failure was no fluke. That was the Prince of Darkness showing up to watch the final moments of his deal. You won. And so did he. And now that Devils deal Baltimore made has come around to the other side, as all deals eventually do. I have a feeling that you will be seeing much more of this as the balance exherts itself. Safe travels, friends.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was going off of the news report that I read earlier about them telling him that CLE is a working town. It reminded me that few people get anything handed to them in NE Ohio. We make people who become presidents and astronauts because we know that hard work and dedication breed success. We want Johnny to be a success.

*edit: its not about "Making him pay for it". That was really thrown around by the media.  Its about learning. I understand lineage. Manzeil isn't just sitting on the sidelines, he's learning from Hoyer, who learned from Brady, who learned from Belichick. This is putting Johnny into that lineage and is part of what has the chance to take him from "Possible Great" to "Amazing"* </TEXT>

Maybe a life long love of photography was the thing that inspired this person to go into arts and design.  Chances would be they had taken a lot of pictures in their life,  probably more than the average person. Just a question of odds says they have a better chance of capturing an anomaly due to the sheer volume of pictures taken. Though I don't think it's faeries,  I don't think his profession should automatically rule him out as a faker.

<TEXT> Has anyone been keeping up on his crusade on Wikipedia? He has made some pretty high level computer hacker type enemies through it. I dont know if there is a correlation. I just know that he has been attacking right wing anti-pagan Wikipedia editors who have been systematically getting pagan pages taken down, through the abuse of the rules system. It even caused one of them to get their real life persona outed, and themselves banned from Wikipedia. Planting pictures on someones computer doesnt take Anonymous level hacking skills. Did someone actually do that *shrug* I'm a bit of a conspiracy nut, so maybe/maybe not. This is just something that went through my head.  *edited for spelling* </TEXT>

<TEXT> ###"Never Date a Writer" inspired by the works of "xstephens"

Never date a writer,    
no just never date a writer.    
It's been spoken at least once before,    
I know this;    
I'm inspired.    
If it's their ire you inquire,    
then you might just catch on fire    
In some sultry sleazy novel    
that goes screaming down the wire    
They'll start writing    
and just writing    
Diatribes that are so biting    
Of your hip size    
and your thigh size    
of that surprise between your thigh size    
Oh he's right!    
that writer writes    
about his libel barks and bites    
and as I sit here quite a quiver    
at this feeling he's delivered    
of his maddened observation    
that has taken hold his liver    
and contrived his consternation    
That has brought me such Elation!    
For it's true    
I say it's true    
as a peddler of my whimsy    
that at times a writer can be trite    
Our ego's may be flimsy    
So our hero's in our story    
tend to hint at lusted glory's    
we may wish we had the livers    
to stand proudly and deliver    
And our villains may resemble    
those that made us shake and tremble    
And so I ramble on the merits
of this Shakespearean Degenerate (that's 'day-djo-nare-it' for the non bourgeoisie)    
and you have grinned and bared it    
So there's one more thing I share:    
The street it goes two ways    
as the pen it streaks the paper    
Not always are the ones close by    
the Mobster or the Raper    
you're the ones who create the sonnets    
the inspirers of Romances    
You bring about our ecstasy    
as our paper and quill dances    
so thank you for your sacrifice    
Our art exists by you.    
You light our fuse    
You are our muse    
We love you.    
I swear we do...     </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ive been reading your post history to find out if you are as aggressive and attacking to others as you have been to me. Turns out youre worse. You say some of the nastiest, meanest, and unhelpful things and you do it all over reddit and you do it thinking you are correct for trashing the folks you do. You trash people who think differently than you, and your posts are often just mean and belittling. "GTFO"? Why would you cuss that at someone or attack people, period? I thought that was against reddicate and against most subreddit rules. I think a long walk and maybe some medical marijuana might help you. Good luck. I know you'll most likely lash out at me, as is you M.O. or tell me that medical marijuana has no positive studies and that I'm an idiot. Thats okay. Ive gotten used to you and I now see that you cant help but be combative, and reddit is probably how you discharge all that negativity so that it doesn't effect your walking life (if you have one, because the level of negative interactions you have daily on reddit suggest you may ONLY  have this outlet to relieve yourself of the poison that your personality creates within you.) Bless your heart, it must be hard to have to force feed your opinions with a sledgehammer to those that dont think the way you do. Good luck, again, and may reddit protect its charges from the worst of your aggression. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I dont know if you are American or not, but I learned on a recent trip (my firs) to Canada how subliminal words can be. In Canada they have the same red circle and white line through the middle "Do Not Enter" street signs, but they do not say "Do Not Enter" on them. They just assume you know what it means, and they don't add that added line of, what I learned after not being subjected to it for 2 weeks is, aggression. I found this article to be saying the same thing: "Our wording is detrimental" I haven't said anything, and I don't believe the article said anything about any medical treatment being wrong, or inappropriate. the main point I saw was the need for a change in our verbiage, and I agree. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think much of the problem is you cant patent manuka honey. It just kills staph infections, and theres no way to capitalize on it monetarily. Same with reiki, chiropractics and homeopathy; iteslf around since the 1800's with 100's of positive case studies. You just cant patent and control the medicine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> /u/ChairmanMaoffin had an awesome thing to say on this 
 Evidenced-based medicine has been proposed and accepted as a more accurate name for western or conventional medicine because it describes what we do- utilize the most evidenced-based preventions and treatments for patients

I think that Alfred Willowhawk would really dig that response. What I got from this article was less about what types of medicine work for who, and more about how our terminology is aggressive and detrimental to the goal of finding the best method for treating each individual.

Abstract

Gethin G, Cowman S. Case series of use of Manuka honey in leg ulceration. Abstract The historical and current literature reports the successful use of honey to manage a diversity of wound aetiologies. However, only in the last 40 years is research on its mode of action and contribution to wound healing being investigated. The challenge of managing chronic non healing wounds generated interest in researching non standard therapies. The aims of the study were to gain insight into the practical use of Manuka honey in wound management. The objective was to test the feasibility of further rigorous research into the use of honey in the management of chronic wounds. Instrumental case series were used to examine the use of Manuka honey in eight cases of leg ulceration. To collect the necessary data, photographs, acetate tracings, data monitoring and patient comments and observations were used to add greater reliability and validity to the findings. The wounds were dressed weekly with Manuka honey. The results obtained showed three males and five females with ulceration of different aetiologies were studied. A mean initial wound size for all wounds of 5.62 cm(2) was obtained. At the end of four-week treatment period, the mean size was 2.25 cm(2). Odour was eliminated and pain reduced. The conclusions drawn were that the use of Manuka honey was associated with a positive wound-healing outcome in these eight cases. Arterial wounds showed minimal improvement only." </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is correct. The idea of the article was that the lable of "alternative" has unfairly garnered the co-definition of "ineffective". Manuka honey on a staph infection heals it.  Even science agrees with that,  but its considered "alternative" because they can't patent honey and sell it for an exorbitant amount of money. The thing that I most agreed with was this assertion that our terminology may be out of date.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My honest reply is "No. I would not be excited to have him." His stats dont paint a whole picture. Yes he has broken passing records. Has he broken playoff records? Also: he can spend a whole game knocking down receivers (hence his stat numbers) and then the last play of the game, the one to win it all, he throws an interception,  or a really bad throw. We have Greg Little. We would need no help choking on the final throw/catch of the game. Lol Do I hate Romo?  No. I just think he is more in league with Andy Dalton than Tom Brady.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Weeden has a long progression, and he gets spooked easily. Many of his drops come from him throwing it too hard. (which is only half his fault. He WAS throwing it to Bess and Little, who are not the best at actually catching the ball) His sack record has a lot to do with his inability to get rid of the ball in time, and then panicking. He had Joe Thomas, Alex Mack, Greco, Schwartz. He had some good protection. He could be really good if someone could teach him. That 2012 game was a BARN-BURNER!!! </TEXT>

He has a gun that he uses too liberally when a normal throw would do, and he fluffs it when he needs to drill it to a receiver. Maybe you guys can do something with him now that he is a backup, and no longer a high profile flop. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This morning, at around 4:30, I jumped out of bed because I had some super important stuff to do, that I was obviously late for. We sleep outside in a seperate building from the house. When I got outside and looked around the twilight yard in the darkened rain pouring on my head, I realized I had nothing to do, and was wondering wtf I thought I needed to be doing, naked in the rain, at 4:30am. This has never happened before. I have Algonquin ancestry, as well. Which I just learned is a home for the some odd the Wendigo legends. Now this comes up on reddit.  Weird. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a Die Hard Dawg, I just want to say: Ravens, I'm sorry. I cant like you. I would say "Nothing Personal" but it totally is. I would say "No offense" but I cant help it if you get offended. I CAN say: I love your coach, and I think he is the best one in the whole division. Pettine might make me proud, but Harbaugh is a good guy. You also got the better of the two brothers.

Steelers. Steelers Steelers Steelers. I dont know what happened last year. Aging team, too comfortable coaching staff, karma, I dont know. I see a serious dropping in your AFC North standings if you dont make some serious changes (which I see that you have started with the coaching staff) I think you have the dirtiest coach in the AFC North. It's true. He cheats. Boo on cheating. You know, I could go on about how I am a Browns fan and hate the Steelers, but instead I am just going to say: Good luck on the rebuild.

Bengals. We share a heritage. You took in a wonderful man whom we kicked out unfairly and finished his legacy with honor. Thank you for helping immortalize Paul Brown. You guys have a chance to make it to the Super Bowl, but you are going to have to shake the rust off that Red Rifle. Not to mention I dont even know most of the people on your O-Line. (that might be my fault for being stuck up the Brownies Butt all season) Get a better secondary receiver and maybe find the Law Firm in contempt. He didnt do much to help you last season.

The Browns are ONCE AGAIN the question mark. Maybe they will dominate with a new coach, massive cap space, and 10 draft picks with 2 in the first round. MAYBE. Or will it be same post 99 Browns, different year? I dont know. We're a mess. I think Hoyer can win, but can he? He seems to get hurt easily. I think Gordon can be a game changer, but can he? We didnt win any of the games he broke records in. I think Pettine is a good coach. But will he actually be able to lead the Factory of Sadness?  

Well, thanks for letting me bitch and posture about how I feel about the AFC North. And I will leave y'all with this: I can talk trash about the AFC North, but if you aint following one of our teams, then shut yer mouth. 

Peace, All

<TEXT> Yes! I almost never remember what I say to people in those situations. We do a ritual called The White Goddess Ritual where the priestess in the center is veiled in white, and invokes the Bright Mother. Then everyone has a chance to come up to, hug, and get an interaction with the Goddess. This one time afterwards my partner Bella had been the one invoked, and this little girl came up and said "Can I have another hug?"

And Bella said: "Okay honey, but it wont be the same. I was invoked with Goddess last time"

Then the little girl hugged her, and kinda smacked her lips like she didnt like the taste of the tea, or something, and said: "Nah. That's not right. And you had blond hair then" and just wandered off with her mom. Bella's hair was red :) </TEXT>

LOL Sorry about the lack of context before I started posting. We just happen to be in the middle of rehearsals for Spring Mysteries Festival, so many of these posts are blogs of what each priest/ess is going through as they work with their God forms. It's a way for people to get to see the kind of transformations that occur within the people that hold these monumental energies. I have done invocation and psychodrama for 10 years, and the changes and growth that happen through the process of working these energies is really amazing sometimes. Like Anansi says when he shares a story: "This is my story as I have told it. If it be sweet, or if it be not sweet; take some with you, and let some come back to me". One of the things I was hoping to hear from people was their experiences holding energies in their own psychodramas and rituals. I'd love to hear stories from anyone who would like to share. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're very welcome. We are moving in directions that are not nearly parallel to the ATC of the past. Are we still trying to break ground for Wiccan Rights? Yes. Are we still trying to put out the best resources we know how to? Yes. Are those resources, and ground breaking going to be done in the same manner as the past. Most likely not. We are pretty much only ATC in name and possessions.

Talking about the Seminary: The Seminary has been staffed by hand picked teachers (many of which are not a part of the ATC Mother Church in WA, but by teachers from all over the country, and some not associated with the ATC through anything except the Seminary) by Bella for the past 5 years. Not only that, but the Seminary doesnt teach a tradition. We teach what are the Sacred Sciences behind magic. We leave it to the individual group leaders to teach a tradition. We also do not Initiate through the school (because it is mostly online) though a student has the ability to find a local teacher because of the scope of the ATC affiliate network.

The ATC cant decide to not use it's name any longer. The disaster that would come in the wake of such a decision would be apocalyptic. It's not just us in Washington anymore. The dissolution of the ATC would effect thousands of congregants world wide. The name (as besmirched as it may be in certain circles) is connected to Governmental infrastructures that would disenfranchise dozens of groups that depend on us if we were to not maintain the Umbrella Document as it is written.

It was only through all of the infrastructure the ATC built that we were able to get legal churches in the Mid-South. Tennessee Religious law is INSANE. It is made to keep non-Abrahamic religions out of the loop. It's actually only because of the legitimacy of the seminary that The Jenny Jones Show (I need citation on the actual show. Might be Sally Jesse Raphael, might be Maury Povich. Terry Riley knows) said they would be willing to call Terry "Rev. Terry Riley" and not "Self Proclaimed Witch Terry Riley". It's a crazy story that I would love to get my hands on and post here. 

At this stage in the game, the only hope I have is by changing a complete culture that some people see within the organization that I love. There was a time when it was run my a closed fist. We could not do things more differently if we were an open hand. Love is our law, and just like the reputation that I have learned of, was built brick by brick, action by action, so shall it be disassembled. The ATC was ever only supposed to bring legitimacy and resources to the community, and as I sit here and tell you now please believe me: That is how the world will see it when I am done. 

Blessings to you, and I hope I have done some to help you have, maybe, a glimmer of hope that the Aquarian Tabernacle Churches future will make you far prouder than anything that may have existed in the past. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Even if you believe Pete Davis is not Brit Trad, Belladonna Laveau is and she is the Archpriestess and Pete is Retired. Not that it matters, but Pete is initiated into the Kent Tradition of Wicca, as well as by Raymond Buckland, as well as Gypsy Ravish. Also, our 501 (c) 3 is not the same as a regular one. Its a common misconception that even the State offices make when we are affiliating new churches. Every time they talk the new affiliate into not filing the correct paper work, because not even the clerks are familiar with it. Its a rare classification, I can understand the confusion. 

On the topic of Woolston Steen Theological Seminary: @ $39.00 a month when compared to any other college that offers Associates through Doctorate (Cherry Hill is a Masters and Doctorate program only) WSTS prices are almost free at less than $500 a year. Cherry Hill costs $95 a unit hour, which ends up being far more expensive per class, as well as being inaccessible for people without a Bachelors degree. 

 The ATC is not the same that it was 10 years ago. It's not the same as it was even a year ago. 

There is a world of bad blood that we are cleaning up from Petes time; many blockages that the community has placed in the way of the ATC because of whatever it was that Pete did/said/acted like to upset those around him. I invite you to get in line so that we can do our best to patch up any wounds that you may have from past experiences, Bella and I have been spending the last year doing just that with the other community members who have the same issues. All we are trying to do is be accessible to the community, build our local communities (both magical as well as mundane), and help empower others to be successful. 

And I would love to talk to you privately if you would wish to write me, but thought I should address your concerns in the same forum that they were raised. I don't know how the Aquarian Tabernacle Church was done before, but you might want to check us out again before you decide what we are and aren't. The times they are a changing. Blessings.

<TEXT> SMH. That's not hostility. All I've tried to do is participate in this community. I've only been here for about a week. People have voted every one of my posts up to #1 status, post after post. Dozens of people vote them up, yet the comments from 3 or 4 of the same people, over and over, seem to be disparaging, critical, or made to put a person on the defensive. I dont know what I did originally, but I'm sorry. I never meant to flare that nerve. And I'm sorry for pushing back instead of being receptive from the get go. I have not had a chance to peruse through the content here. I help run a huge church (in size, not wealth) that takes up a large portion of my time. I am working on learning the lines for a 4 day long play, in which I'm playing Herakles. Not to mention there is the Boy Child who has to be taken to school every day and picked up after band. It was never my intention NOT to contribute. I talk on Facebook all day. It was only ever my intention to contribute. I hear that it's important to add to the dialogue. My only objection has ever been that I have a natural 'push back' against being told what to do. I'm an Aries. LOL But I have a Pisces Rising, and an Aquarian Moon, so I am super sweet when I'm not cornered, and my friends are more important to me than just about anything. I want to have the people here to be part of those friends, and if we can move forward, I would love to make that happen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was on WifeSwap. If anyone has any questions about that, I would be happy to answer them. 

My personal favorite Witchcraft in the media was the episode of Charmed where they went back to Salem, and their powers didnt work. They had to use the craft of the day, because their powers didnt exist yet. So they had to do a protection spell, and so they cut an apple in half, exposing the pentacle in the center, and held a piece of Basil against it, and it made a protection spell. It was TOTALLY magically sound. Apples are immortality magic. The pentacle  in the center is the same as a pentacle in a circle which means "All four elements and spirit in perfect harmony" which makes things manifest. Basil is used to dispel negativity. So Immortality magic+Dispelling negativity+a manifestation circle(pentacle in circle)=Protection from evil. I was impressed. (both with the show, and my training. LOL) </TEXT>

<TEXT> The ATC is a 33 year old church, and the only one in the world with an "Umbrella Tax Exemption" which means that affiliates can get legal status through us, instead of the Fed. It is a REALLY rare classification that not even all the Christian Churches have. It is why we have as many rights, Wicca wide, as we do. The ATC and their status with the government enables ALL WICCAN CHURCHES AND PRACTITIONERS to be seen as legit. I hope that helps :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I will do NOTHING to prove you wrong. "I reddit because I have things to share". Not "I reddit at your behest." I have read your past posts, and if people lived according to your weird views of life, I would be afraid of who I am, and hide my faith to protect myself from ridicule. You have suggested to new pagans to hide the symbols of their faith:

"I know, we have just as much right to wear a symbol of our faith as any other. And being out in the public helps fight the hate. If you know us, you don't hate us.
The person spewing bigoted remarks is entirely responsible for their hateful behavior. But knowing that these confrontations will occur while wearing the symbol. One has to ask one's self why they are wearing the pentacle and if they should continue.
I stopped wearing mine because I realized I had a chip on my shoulder and was begging the world to pick a fight with me. "

I think your attitude IS the chip on your shoulder. Dont blame your pentacle for people picking a fight with you. If you treat people irl the way you treat people online, I cant imagine you get much purchase with them. 

Further delving into your posting past shows that to follow you is to believe that Wicca is a club of intelligent solitaries, and megalomaniacal group leaders. 

"Covens can be a more structured environment to learn Wicca and see it in practice, but in my experience getting involved with a coven is a crap shoot. The best covens function as a group of friends, whereas ones made up of the public, or acquaintances can break down rather dramatically. Internal drama and megalomaniacal personalities are likely issues. "

I especially like where you speak for all of Wicca (which you seem to get REALLY bent about when you read what you perceive as people doing just that)

"Wicca is a highly unstructured religion."

The reason you enjoy the benefits that all the other major religions enjoy is because of the Highly Structured Churches of Wicca fighting for your rights. All you are doing is lying to new Wiccans, implanting your own psychosis and fears onto people who have come to this site looking for help, info, or support on their path, and driving away established churches/groups/people who would lend credibility to a number of the discussions that you are regurgitating on. Every page of your history has at least one comment where you are trashing someone and telling them to buy ad space for reddit. THATS spam, sir. You. You are playing the reddit police, and it seems by a few deleted OP's accounts, that you scare some of them. Bully on you. I cant believe you havent been reported yet. 

So anyone reading: I am a 3rd degree Gardenarian. My lineage is through Ed Fitch and Janet Farrar. I cant speak for anyone else but myself, and myself is a Wiccan with STRONG lineage who works every day to further Wicca. You speak for ALL OF WICCA and you tell untruths. 

You constantly rail about how you are Wiccan, but dont follow the major beliefs: "As I have so frequently said in this forum, I am Wiccan and I don't believe in magic"

Well Patricia Crowther details in "Covensense" that if you feel the need to change the BOS, then you arent Wiccan, so think on that when you're telling all these new people that they dont need to be Wiccan to be Wiccan.

So: You want dialogue? We're having dialogue. Lets start one about how you make /r/wicca a hostile environment for new people, and how that's against reddiquette.

<TEXT> This sounds like professional jealousy.  We are rocking it with front page worthy content, and it seems to not be sitting well with some. Also: we don't profit off of traffic to our site. All of that content is put there for the community, not to line our pockets. I'm going to keep posting until I break a rule, (speaking of which the rule about posts/replies needing to be constructive might pertain to your post, as all it has done is trash a Wiccan news source and try to shame it into not posting on an open Wiccan forum) and thanks: maybe I'll buy some ad space to show my support. But the last thing I will do to "support reddit" is discontinue posting. Bless your heart.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I dont think the Gods understand "Next time" I think they are stuck in a perpetual cycle. As soon as Persephone has returned and begins making flowers, it is like she is the Kore again and has never left. Demeter would never think "I cant bear to lose her again!", because she never HAS lost her to that point.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that's an awesome idea. Maybe an amendment to the site posting rules? Also: more than 75% of my posts will be from Panegyria.com just like certain people only really post from Patheos, or any number of other pagan sites. I work at the Aquarian Tabernacle Church in the social media department. Our social media has been nonexistent for many years. I am changing that reality :) My point of posting is to share with the rest of the Wiccan community the amazing people that post through our online magazine. (to which we are always looking for spirited contributors) Though we do not have an Original Poster clause, 99% of our content cannot be found anywhere else on the net. My point of sharing it here is to give the community the best possible chance to have access to this content, and to create discussion about the topics there-in. If you would like a little write up before each one though, I am happy to do such. :)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's pagan content from a Wiccan church. I didnt know I had to post a reason with it. I've been all over the site rules and the reddiquette, and nothing says there has to be statement of reason for choosing to post. I dont really have a problem posting why I am posting. I see that you are a moderator. I read over all the rules before I began posting, and have adhered to them. If anything anywhere had mentioned that we needed a reason to post something, I would have been doing it from the start. Is this just a personal thing, or is this a site wide known thing that is an "unwritten rule"? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The ATC doesn't represent all of Wicca. If the writer is referring to ATC, then they should make that very clear. All of these issues could have been fixed by using words that don't generalize us all. "Most Wiccans," "Some Pagans," "We at the ATC."

I can totally understand why the above remark generated inside of you. The ATC doesnt speak for all Wiccans. And since Wiccans by definition are 
(supposed to be) self responsible it can turn some folks off if they think people are trying to be their voice. When it comes to the Government the ATC is who they listen to about Wicca because it is the ATC that has been the engine behind almost every inch of ground Wicca has gained in their eyes. Even if The ATC doesnt speak for you directly, their contributions to you help you every day. 

There is just too many folks attacking us from the outside for us to bicker and play King of the Hill. We are all helping each other out. Many people have done much. The Author of this article is an ATC fan. He credits the structure of the church for making it possible for Pagans to exist in the open, in the Mid South. The Arkansas/Missouri/Tennessee area is very volatile, and have a lot of criteria for churches that only the unique structure of the Aquarian Tabernacle Church was able to meet. Also, when marched against a whole City, and  it was do or die, he sent out letters to everyone he could think of to help him. Only the ATC responded. It ended up being one of the greatest victories for Wicca that no one knows about, so is a bit of a cheerleader for them in that regard. 

It's nice to meet you, btw. I saw that you are a Super Virgo. (I looked at some of your posts) I have No Virgo anywhere in my chart, [Aries/Sun,Pisces/Rising,Aquarian/Moon] but it is nice to meet you, and I hope we can continue to have really enjoyable discourse. We dont all have to agree, but I hope we can all get along through the process :) Blessings </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Aquarian Tabernacle Church and Pete Pathfinder Davis have done, as far as I can tell by looking at history, far more with far less scandal than the Frosts. Veterans Tombstone Pentacle, only .edu sponsored pagan seminary, umbrella 501 (c) 3 which just by the ATC having it, it gives all of Wicca privileges that other pagan religions don't enjoy in the eyes of the government, prisoner rights for incarcerated pagans, and a myriad other accomplishments from the making it safe to be open in the Mid-South, to defending churches from all denominations (Pagan to Christian and back again) from unfair laws levied against home worship. I think few people throw Pete's name around in the circles of Pagans changing the world, because his ministry has always been behind a desk and not in front of a camera. The video of him posted earlier in the month was the first video of him I have ever seen, though I have enjoyed the benefits of his accomplishments every day I have been a Pagan. Which is every year of my life since I was 5. I think that Pete has always been an administrative Pagan. Raymond Buckland called him one of the most influential Pagans in history. His life before Paganism was one of political service. He was the mayor of Hanover, NJ. No democrat had been elected as mayor in that town for over 100 years, until he ran. He kept the job until he decided not to run again. Wicca may not seem political, but as Wiccans we are charged with keeping the balance. The People in here may or may not be correct about there being/not being a conspiracy concerning Christians and the government, but we are woefully short of Pagan politicians on either side of the isle. That's an imbalance. Pete has always told me (because I've been lucky enough to know the man) that you get more done in a tweed jacket and leather elbow patches than you can get done in a cape. He means that we need to get out there into the real world and make our lives and beliefs a parallel to the places we live in. Its no longer shocking that were Pagan. Now that we can get past meeting someone workout them freaking out about our beliefs, some of us are ready to have a say at the school board, or in city council, or on higher levels of government. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One must also remember that the writer of the original post is located within the Mid South in the Jonesboro, AR area. The author in question also led one of the most violently protested (by very angry Christians) marches in Wiccan History:
[ http://www.childrenofthecircle.com/videos.htm ] I am happy that the post has made people talk. I personally cant see Wicca as NOT a nature religion, since everything we do is based on the cycles of the seasons. Sabbats fall on Astrological dates (0 degrees Aries is Ostara, 15 degrees Taurus is Beltain, etc.) that coincide with harvests, livestock and planting schedules. All the creatures of the Earth are the voices, heartbeat, and children of The Lord and the Lady. In my humble opinion.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello, all! I work with The Woolston-Steen Theological Seminary (WSTS) @ WiccanSeminary.EDU We are a college offering degrees from Associates to Doctorate in Wiccan Ministries. We do not offer Degreed Elevations DIRECTLY. We have teachers from all over America, in Canada and in Australia. Teachers have the right to take on any student from the school that they find to be appropriate for training with them. So through the school, you are able to not only acquire your legal degree, but to find the teacher that is right for you. We do online course work through Second Life, which allows us to have tangible, virtual, classrooms in which you attend your courses.

In keeping with tradition as much as is possible while still keeping with the forward thinking needed to navigate an increasingly cyber world, none of our degreed elevations are done online, and must be done in person. You can attend the entirety of the College online, but to obtain your ordination through a High Priestess and High Priest, it must be done in person. This is the benefit that WSTS has in being sponsored by the ATC, which boasts a myriad churches around the country: It is increasingly easy to pair you up with someone local to you.

Our .EDU domain was entrusted to WSTS directly from the US Government to denote the validity of our school, and that anyone who was searching for a valid Wiccan seminary, would be able to do so at a glance. We are incredible reasonably priced (less than $1000 a year). We also have work scholarships for those who meet the financial requirements. I hope this helps anyone who has been looking for something like Woolston-Steen, and if you happen to need something different we wish you blessings on finding your path, and we cant wait to see you there as we walk it ourselves. Peace, Love and Light. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see all the people who habitually surrender out of their games posting here, and I understand that you wouldn't want to be penalized, but the game ending and the lobby popping up before the game is over is penalization for those that dont have endless time to play. Some of us dont get to get home from school/work and just veg on smite. The people who want to play a game through to the end are already copping a punishment, so why should the people who cant make it a whole game be off scott free? If there was a penalty of some sort, people would think before casting a vote 10 minutes into a conquest match before anyone has even lost a tower. And people shouldnt be penalized for not surrendering. The point is to PLAY  the game.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been in too many conquest games where people vote to surrender as soon as it gets difficult. More than half the time no one has even lost a tower, or our team is actually ahead in position, but maybe behind in total gold and levels. What's more: more often than not we end up winning the matches that we stay in. It makes me think poorly of my teammates when the surrender is used like a reset button, willy nilly. I think the peraon who initiates the surrender, as well as everyone who votes to uphold the surrender, should incur a goodwill loss. It doesnt hurt their bottom line, its just a reminder that its unsportsmanlike to constantly leave games before youve seen them through to the end. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just want to point out that through Woolston-Steen you can get a legal Associates through Doctorate degree, as well as have the opportunity to meet a dozen possible teachers that WILL take students down a 1st-3rd initiatory path. Those Degrees are not charged for. The only money charged is for the College itself (because it is a real college with a .EDU website and license from the state to award legal degrees.) Blessings, and I hope that helps! </TEXT>
