Even if you ignore this, animal agriculture has a huge contribution to global warming, leads to large amounts of nitrate runoff, and uses a disproportionate amount of water and other resources. Even if you completely ignore the harm to non-human animals there are substantial impacts to other humans to consider. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just imagine if we allowed experimenting on humans without their consent though. We could very likely have expanded that age even further.

Nonetheless, (I hope) you would be on the side protesting against that. Extending life for some is great, but cannot be justified at any cost.

Our society does not yet fairly factor in the complex and sophisticated interests and lives possessed by many other animals when deciding how we allow them to be treated. If we were to give just consideration to other animals we would find that many of the experiments we conduct today still would not be justified. We would also need to acknowledge that the animals being raised for food on contemporary farms, and animals being used for entertainment in circuses or zoos are also facing a brutal injustice. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  If you take out factory farming, the numbers change considerably. Just because the most popular method for producing meat is harmful doesn't mean they all are. Here is a detailed article going into depth on why pasture grazing is needed. Pasture grazing creates critical habitat for many species.

The reason these cruel factory farms exist is because they are efficient. Yes, there may be more diversity when allowing cattle to graze on uncultivated grasslands, but it comes at a far larger cost of land, and [higher greenhouse gas emissions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2535638/):

Adding the carbon debt resulting from the additional cleared land required by the two-thirds less efficient grass finishing process (26.6 million acres  10,400 lb/acre/year, or 276.6 billion lb/year) results in the organic system totaling 770 billion lb of CO2-equivalent GHG emissions; or 58% higher than the conventional systems total of 487.5 billion lb. </TEXT>

<TEXT> According to the [American Dietetic Association](http://www.eatright.org/WorkArea//DownloadAsset.aspx?id=8417):

It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

Similarly, the [British Dietetic Association](https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/vegetarianfoodfacts) describes veganism as a type of vegetarian diet and continues:

Well planned vegetarian diets can be both nutritious and healthy. They have been associated with lower risks of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, certain types of cancer and lower blood cholesterol levels.

Well planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for all stages of life.

The position of the Australian Government's [National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55_australian_dietary_guidelines_130530.pdf) is that:

Appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthy and nutritionally
adequate. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the lifecycle.

Finally the [Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx) state:

A vegan eating pattern has many potential health benefits. They include lower rates of obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer. Other benefits include lower blood cholesterol levels and a lower risk for gallstones and intestinal problems.

This eating pattern can take some extra planning. Vegans must make sure that enough nutrients like protein, iron, zinc, calcium, vitamins D and B12 and omega-3 fats are included.

A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But what if, like the REG article states, it is possible to get much more money donated to the groups ACE recommends by donating to ACE, which will then get many other people to donate to the charities they recommend?

For instance: Donating $1000 towards the staff of a meta-charity may generate several thousand dollars of direct donations that would not have been made otherwise, or would have gone to less cost-effective interventions. Instead of donating my money towards helping people directly and thus creating one additional direct donor, I might be able to create many direct donors by going meta and donating towards the promotion of charitable giving.

GiveWell, whose main meta-activity is cost-effectiveness research, tracks their money moved. If we compare this amount to all their expenses so far, we get a fund ratio thats in the ballpark of 30:1, too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Ingredients**

* 1 can chickpeas, reserving a small handful for the avocado cream (you can cook dried ones as well)
* 3 cloves garlic
* 1 small onion
* 2 teaspoons ground cumin
* A BIG bunch of both fresh parsley and coriander
* Salt and pepper
* 2 Tablespoons olive oil
* 3/4 cup chickpea flour (sometimes called gram flour)
* Burger buns and fresh tomato for serving

**For the avocado cream and tahini mayo**

* 1 avocado
* A small handful chickpeas left from can
* A bunch of fresh parsley
* 1 garlic clove
* 2 tablespoons tahini
* The juice of one lemon
* 2 tablespoons water

**Directions**

Throw your chickpeas, peeled garlic, onion, cumin and salt and pepper into a food processor and pulse until roughly blended. Youll need to scrape down the sides. Now add in the fresh herbs, oil and flour and blend until you have a nice thick texture, but it will still be fairly moist. Place into a bowl and if you need, add a little more flour to help the mixture bind as you form them into the patties. Make them small or big as you prefer. In a flat frying pan, heat about half an inch of oil over medium to high and add in your burgers. Cook for about 4 -5 minutes on both sides and once they are on their second turn, press them gently to make them flatter if you need. They should turn a nice dark, golden brown and smell divine!

For the avocado cream, simply add to your processor the avocado (without skin of course!), the remaining chickpeas, parsley and 1 garlic clove and blend until smooth. For the tahini mayo, drop the two tablespoons of tahini into a small bowl with the lemon juice and water and whisk with folk until you have a creamy consistency.

Toast the bun, add the burger, then the avocado, then a slice of tomato and finish with the oozy, lovely tahini mayo! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everyone feels like veganism is going to be difficult until they give it a shot. Every vegan I know says it was much easier than they expected.

One thing you may find helpful is to commit to going vegan a day or two a week at first. That way you can find new foods that you enjoy without cutting everything else out at once. From there it becomes much easier to be vegan another day per week until you get up to full time! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Avoiding animal products does not limit someone to a single dietary option. You still have a huge diversity of foods to choose from. You can still mix up your ratios of macro nutrients to cover any extreme or anywhere in the middle. You can still eat low or high calorie, target specific micro nutrients, avoid sugar or eat lots of it. 

Being vegan isn't a single diet plan. It is a choice people make to behave in a way that causes less harm to others, but that doesn't mean removing any aspect of choice from our lives. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think this is one more important step to getting people to change their eating habits. People are aware of the terrible cruelty to animals that happens on these farms. People are increasingly becoming aware of the large environmental impact of raising animals for food (not just in terms of global warming but they also require a lot of water and produce a lot of waste, far more than we could ever appropriately use as fertilizer, which leads to runoff, pollution of drinking water, and dead zones). People know that there are many healthier and often more affordable alternatives to animal products available. People are increasingly worried about antibiotic resistant bacteria and other health hazards created by factory farms. Adding this outbreak will only hasten the shift toward alternatives.

Per capita meat consumption in the US is down by about 10% since 2007. People do care about the huge negative consequences of animal agriculture, and within the next 10-20 years we will see some substantial progress. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like a dairy cow, a pig uses its tail not only to shoo away insects but also to communicate. Like dogs, pigs wag their tails when they are happy, twitch them when they are nervous, let them drop straight down when they are sick. They may stick them straight out behind them when they are frightened or alarmed.

Pigs wag their tails when they are happy and content.

<TITLE> Falafel with Avocado Cream   Tahini Mayo </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-13 18:58:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Final Result](http://i.imgur.com/wIuxb6p.jpg)

**Ingredients**

* 1 can chickpeas, reserving a small handful for the avocado cream (you can cook dried ones as well)
* 3 cloves garlic
* 1 small onion
* 2 teaspoons ground cumin
* A BIG bunch of both fresh parsley and coriander
* Salt and pepper
* 2 Tablespoons olive oil
* 3/4 cup chickpea flour (sometimes called gram flour)
* Burger buns and fresh tomato for serving

**For the avocado cream and tahini mayo**

* 1 avocado
* A small handful chickpeas left from can
* A bunch of fresh parsley
* 1 garlic clove
* 2 tablespoons tahini
* The juice of one lemon
* 2 tablespoons water

**Directions**

Throw your chickpeas, peeled garlic, onion, cumin and salt and pepper into a food processor and pulse until roughly blended. Youll need to scrape down the sides. Now add in the fresh herbs, oil and flour and blend until you have a nice thick texture, but it will still be fairly moist. Place into a bowl and if you need, add a little more flour to help the mixture bind as you form them into the patties. Make them small or big as you prefer. In a flat frying pan, heat about half an inch of oil over medium to high and add in your burgers. Cook for about 4 -5 minutes on both sides and once they are on their second turn, press them gently to make them flatter if you need. They should turn a nice dark, golden brown and smell divine!

For the avocado cream, simply add to your processor the avocado (without skin of course!), the remaining chickpeas, parsley and 1 garlic clove and blend until smooth. For the tahini mayo, drop the two tablespoons of tahini into a small bowl with the lemon juice and water and whisk with folk until you have a creamy consistency.

Toast the bun, add the burger, then the avocado, then a slice of tomato and finish with the oozy, lovely tahini mayo! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good news! You actually don't need any nutrients from meat! You can live a happy and healthy life as a vegetarian!

According to the [American Dietetic Association](http://www.eatright.org/WorkArea//DownloadAsset.aspx?id=8417):

It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

Similarly, the [British Dietetic Association](https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/vegetarianfoodfacts) describes veganism as a type of vegetarian diet and continues:

Well planned vegetarian diets can be both nutritious and healthy. They have been associated with lower risks of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, certain types of cancer and lower blood cholesterol levels.

Well planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for all stages of life.

The position of the Australian Government's [National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55_australian_dietary_guidelines_130530.pdf) is that:

Appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthy and nutritionally
adequate. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the lifecycle.

Finally the [Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx) state:

A vegan eating pattern has many potential health benefits. They include lower rates of obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer. Other benefits include lower blood cholesterol levels and a lower risk for gallstones and intestinal problems.

This eating pattern can take some extra planning. Vegans must make sure that enough nutrients like protein, iron, zinc, calcium, vitamins D and B12 and omega-3 fats are included.

A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors. </TEXT>

Imagine we lived in the world of the Matrix where humans were bred by the tens of billions to be used for energy. Our concern should be the well-being of humans as individuals, not the fact that we would go from a population of 50 billion humans down to a more reasonable 7 billion if we stopped humans from being bred excessively. 

Our concern for other animals ought to be the same. There is value in preserving biodiversity, but our primary concern should be for the well-being of the individuals. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Ingredients**

* 1 15 oz can of black beans, rinsed and drained
* 1 cup cooked brown rice
* 3 cups roasted sweet potatoes, see recipe below
* 2 tablespoons chopped red onion
* 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves
*  teaspoon salt
*  teaspoon cumin
*  teaspoon garlic powder
*  teaspoon smoked paprika
*  teaspoon paprika
* Olive oil, for cooking
* 6 hamburger buns
* Burger toppings of your choice
* Jalapeno, to taste

**Roasted Sweet Potatoes:**

* 3 cups diced sweet potatoes
* 1 teaspoon olive oil
*  teaspoon cumin
*  teaspoon paprika
*  teaspoon garlic powder
*  teaspoon salt
*  teaspoon pepper

**Curry Cilantro Mayo:**

* 1 cup Vegenaise or Just Mayo
* 1 and  teaspoons curry powder
* 2 - 3 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro leaves
* 2 teaspoons lemon juice
* 1 pinch of salt

**Instructions**

1. Make the mayo: add all of the mayo ingredients to a medium sized bowl and stir until combined. Set aside.

2. Pre-heat the oven to 375 degrees F. On a large sheet pan, place the diced sweet potatoes, olive oil, and all the spices. Toss until sweet potatoes are coated and place into the pre-heated oven. Roast for about 25 minutes, flipping once, or until sweet potatoes are fork tender. Let cool for a few minutes.

3. Place all of the veggie burger ingredients into a food processor and process for about 3 - 5 seconds until everything is mixed together but still has some texture to it. Form patties (you should get about 6 of them depending on the size you make) and place them on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Chill in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes.

4. Heat a large pan over medium heat and coat the bottom with a thin layer of olive oil. Place burgers in the hot pan and cook for about 10 minutes, flipping once, until burgers are heated through.

5. If grilling the burgers, grill over medium heat and rub a little bit of olive oil on the grill to ensure that the burgers don't stick.

6. Top veggie burgers with curry cilantro mayo and enjoy on a bun with toppings of your choice! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nothing you do can overcome all of the biases people will have against veganism. You can do some things to overcome a lot of it, but there is nothing you can do that will make everyone open to fairly considering what you have to say.

Appearance plays a big role in getting people to take you seriously. You will do much better if you have a clean haircut and decent clothes.

Another important aspect is to use as mainstream of sources as possible. Don't use Freelee as a banana girl as a source to support why you think vegan diets are healthy, reference the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

Finally, act like you understand where people are coming from. You don't need to condone the consumption of animal products, but if you acknowledge people's experiences and beliefs they will be much more willing to hear you out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Authority Nutrition is not an authority on nutrition.

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are being downvoted because you have attempted to dismiss everyone who rightly objects to the abhorrent cruelty that pigs are commonly subjected to on contemporary farms by referring to those people as juvenile and attacking their character despite a complete lack of evidence on your part. At the same time you have failed to present any rational justification for your pro-cruelty stance.

There is no brigade, it is just a bad comment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Several of the above quotes specifically mention vegan diets as being healthy for all stages of life, and the rest say "(*see context*)" suggesting that you should actually go look at the context for the quote, in which case you would see that the sources are including vegan diets as a type of vegetarian diet in their statements. 

These are the largest groups of dietary experts in the world. Some blog source that you saw once on Google of a guy saying he is a recovering vegetarian does not refute that.

Interestingly, what you are doing (rejecting scientific evidence and suggesting that people turn to inferior and unsupported sources) is also a popular strategy used by creationists. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We wouldn't exist today without a lot of the terrible things in the past having happened. That isn't a reason for us to continue doing terrible things today.

There is also overwhelming consensus that we can get everything we need to be healthy as vegans:

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. </TEXT>

And what if that paper clip you just dropped causes a hurricane to develop on the other side of the globe that kills people? You should also try talking to mountains about not crushing people in avalanches because that is wrong.

Or you could be a reasonable individual who does what is possible and practical to minimize their impact on others (human and non-human), and recognizes the fact that even though we can't do everything that shouldn't stop us from doing what we can do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't approve of people consuming dairy and eggs either. The way animals are treated in order to produce these products is unacceptable.

Even if people don't like hearing this, that is a much smaller concern than the need for this message to be heard. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Male chickens do not lay eggs, and the males of the egg laying variety do not grow fast enough to be worth raising for meat either. These chickens are commonly ground up alive [as can be seen in this short video clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huVJDWaKrxM) or explained in more detail [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN0g13kMk6s). Some other places may simply throw the birds into large trash bags to suffocate.

The hens themselves frequently live in terrible conditions even in facilities that try to advertise themselves as being more humane. [Here are pictures of free-range, cage-free, and organic egg laying operations](http://imgur.com/a/fp7C0). Even on the nicest farms though, the hens' egg production begins to drop off after a couple years of age and they will be sent to slaughter. There is no economic way to let these animals live out their entire lives. [Here is a picture showing how old various animals usually are when slaughtered](http://i.imgur.com/LLyM10R.jpg). </TEXT>

<TITLE> Roasted Garlic   Cauliflower Pasta with Walnuts </TITLE>

**Ingredients**

* 2 garlic heads/bulbs, top quarter cut off to expose cloves
* 6 tbsp + 1 tsp olive oil
* pinch of fresh thyme leaves (optional)
* 1 head cauliflower (2 pounds)
* salt + pepper
* 2 tbsp lemon juice, plus extra
* 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, or to taste
* 1 pound brown rice pasta, such as penne or fusilli 
* 2-3 handfuls baby arugula
* 1/4 cup walnut halves, toasted + chopped

**Directions** 

Adjust an oven rack to the middle position, place a naked baking sheet on the rack and preheat to 500 degrees F. Tear two squares of aluminum foil and place cut garlic heads in the centers. Drizzle exposed garlic tops with 1/2 tsp olive oil each. Season with salt, pepper, and thyme leaves (if using). Wrap garlic bulbs up securely and place in the oven. Roast until garlic is browned and mushy/tender, about 40 minutes.

While garlic is roasting, trim the cauliflower leaves and the extra bit of stalk at the bottom. Cut the head right down the middle, from top to bottom. From there, cut each half into 4 wedges. In a medium bowl, toss the cauliflower wedges with 2 tablespoons olive oil, salt, and pepper. Remove the pre-heated baking sheet from the oven and carefully lay the cauliflower wedges onto the surface, leaving some space around each piece. You should hear sizzling. Roast cauliflower until tender and well-browned, about 25 minutes (I flipped mine halfway).

Once slightly cooled, transfer cauliflower to a cutting board and cut into bite-size pieces. Unwrap roasted garlic and squeeze cloves out into a small bowl. Mash roasted garlic with a fork to make a smooth puree. Whisk in the lemon juice, pepper flakes, some salt + pepper, and 1/4 cup of olive oil. Set aside.

Cook brown rice pasta according to package directions with a fat pinch of salt in the water. Reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water before draining. Once drained, return cooked pasta to the pot. Add chopped cauliflower, garlic sauce, arugula, extra lemon juice to taste, and 1/4 cup reserved cooking water. Add more cooking water as necessary to achieve desired consistency. Serve pasta with handfuls of chopped walnuts on top and extra chili flakes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Final Result](http://i.imgur.com/1S70PK3.jpg)

**Ingredients**

* 1 15 oz can of black beans, rinsed and drained
* 1 cup cooked brown rice
* 3 cups roasted sweet potatoes, see recipe below
* 2 tablespoons chopped red onion
* 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves
*  teaspoon salt
*  teaspoon cumin
*  teaspoon garlic powder
*  teaspoon smoked paprika
*  teaspoon paprika
* Olive oil, for cooking
* 6 hamburger buns
* Burger toppings of your choice
* Jalapeno, to taste

**Roasted Sweet Potatoes:**

* 3 cups diced sweet potatoes
* 1 teaspoon olive oil
*  teaspoon cumin
*  teaspoon paprika
*  teaspoon garlic powder
*  teaspoon salt
*  teaspoon pepper

**Curry Cilantro Mayo:**

* 1 cup Vegenaise or Just Mayo
* 1 and  teaspoons curry powder
* 2 - 3 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro leaves
* 2 teaspoons lemon juice
* 1 pinch of salt

**Instructions**

1. Make the mayo: add all of the mayo ingredients to a medium sized bowl and stir until combined. Set aside.

2. Pre-heat the oven to 375 degrees F. On a large sheet pan, place the diced sweet potatoes, olive oil, and all the spices. Toss until sweet potatoes are coated and place into the pre-heated oven. Roast for about 25 minutes, flipping once, or until sweet potatoes are fork tender. Let cool for a few minutes.

3. Place all of the veggie burger ingredients into a food processor and process for about 3 - 5 seconds until everything is mixed together but still has some texture to it. Form patties (you should get about 6 of them depending on the size you make) and place them on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Chill in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes.

4. Heat a large pan over medium heat and coat the bottom with a thin layer of olive oil. Place burgers in the hot pan and cook for about 10 minutes, flipping once, until burgers are heated through.

5. If grilling the burgers, grill over medium heat and rub a little bit of olive oil on the grill to ensure that the burgers don't stick.

6. Top veggie burgers with curry cilantro mayo and enjoy on a bun with toppings of your choice! </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Final Result](http://i.imgur.com/1S70PK3.jpg)

**Ingredients**

* 1 15 oz can of black beans, rinsed and drained
* 1 cup cooked brown rice
* 3 cups roasted sweet potatoes, see recipe below
* 2 tablespoons chopped red onion
* 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves
*  teaspoon salt
*  teaspoon cumin
*  teaspoon garlic powder
*  teaspoon smoked paprika
*  teaspoon paprika
* Olive oil, for cooking
* 6 hamburger buns
* Burger toppings of your choice
* Jalapeno, to taste

**Roasted Sweet Potatoes:**

* 3 cups diced sweet potatoes
* 1 teaspoon olive oil
*  teaspoon cumin
*  teaspoon paprika
*  teaspoon garlic powder
*  teaspoon salt
*  teaspoon pepper

**Curry Cilantro Mayo:**

* 1 cup Vegenaise or Just Mayo
* 1 and  teaspoons curry powder
* 2 - 3 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro leaves
* 2 teaspoons lemon juice
* 1 pinch of salt

**Instructions**

1. Make the mayo: add all of the mayo ingredients to a medium sized bowl and stir until combined. Set aside.

2. Pre-heat the oven to 375 degrees F. On a large sheet pan, place the diced sweet potatoes, olive oil, and all the spices. Toss until sweet potatoes are coated and place into the pre-heated oven. Roast for about 25 minutes, flipping once, or until sweet potatoes are fork tender. Let cool for a few minutes.

3. Place all of the veggie burger ingredients into a food processor and process for about 3 - 5 seconds until everything is mixed together but still has some texture to it. Form patties (you should get about 6 of them depending on the size you make) and place them on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Chill in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes.

4. Heat a large pan over medium heat and coat the bottom with a thin layer of olive oil. Place burgers in the hot pan and cook for about 10 minutes, flipping once, until burgers are heated through.

5. If grilling the burgers, grill over medium heat and rub a little bit of olive oil on the grill to ensure that the burgers don't stick.

6. Top veggie burgers with curry cilantro mayo and enjoy on a bun with toppings of your choice! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some of my least favorite experiences aren't with people trying to be rude, but people who feel hot and decide that it is okay to sit down right next to or even in front of our tables to get shade. I hate having to shoo these people away and seem like the mean vegan even though it clearly isn't appropriate to just plop themselves down directly in front of our tables.

Along those lines there were some girls at the Houston, Texas show who had brought hula hoops to the event and were doing some artistic/acrobatic hula hoop twirling that for some reason they decided to do right next to our tables. After a couple minutes of this, we pointed out to them that people couldn't come up to the table because they didn't want to interfere with their hula hooping and we asked them to choose another spot for what they were doing. 

One of the girls flipped out at this, she walked about 20 feet away, but then turned back and started shouting things like "Hey, I don't see anyone at your table! Nobody wants to go up to you guys anyway!" We mostly ignored her and after a couple minutes she left, but came back later in the day to complain a bit more. It was one of the most immature things I had ever seen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I first got interest in my club by putting up fliers that had little pull off tabs with my contact info around campus. The school also had a club day where students would go around to tables to find out about on campus clubs. I had a sign up sheet for people to provide us with their e-mail addresses and that's where most interested people signed up.

The core people involved in my club were interested in spreading animal rights, but many more people were only interested in tasty vegan food. I'm not a great cook, but I hosted a lot of vegan potlucks as club events. 

My club also did a lot of tabling on campus. I had inherited a lot of stickers that were printed by PETA from a previous animal rights group on campus that had died out a couple years before I started mine. I was also able to make pins/buttons for free using a button maker that the campus had, so we passed these things out for free. If you can't figure out how to get anything like this to pass out for free, you can print stickers super cheap [here](http://www.printrunner.com/cut-to-size-sticker-printing.html) as long as you are printing a large quantity. Passing out a free sticker with a piece of literature can help you reach more people, and anything that you offer for free can bring a lot more people up to your table for a conversation.

Planning a trip to an animal sanctuary, inviting club members to join you for leafleting, holding a movie screening, and [doing a vegan food sampling](http://www.vegfund.org/food-sampling-intro.html) are other good events for on-campus clubs. Assume at first that you will need to be the one taking the initiative to plan these things, but hopefully after a few events you will empower more people to feel comfortable taking the reins on their own. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the easiest and one of the more effective ways to engage in activism is leafleting. You can very easily get booklets from [Vegan Outreach](http://veganoutreach.org/order-form/) or [Mercy For Animals](http://store.mercyforanimals.org/details.php?productId=41) that you can pass out at a college campus or local event (I have leafleted at concerts, farmers markets, and a Fourth of July parade). 

Other options include getting involved with the [10 Billion Lives Tour](http://www.10billiontour.org/volunteer) or [writing letters to the editor for a local paper](http://www.mercyforanimals.org/action-center#letters). While there are some opportunities to volunteer with larger groups such as [The Humane League](http://www.thehumaneleague.com/get-involved/) I think our movement could really benefit from more people taking the initiative to go out and get involved in something they plan on their own even if it is as simple as leafleting a local college campus. 

Finally, don't hesitate to use the internet as a way to reach a lot of people. Online activism, to the extent that it successfully reaches people is just as valuable as similarly effective real-world activism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't get paid for any of my activism. I have a full time job working for a company that administers health insurance and pension plans. I'm responsible for reviewing the agreements that come in and setting up our computer system to handle as much of administering the benefits as possible. I also manage a small group of people doing similar work, and I do a lot of work manipulating large amounts of data using Excel (I'm very good at programming Macros in VBA, so the company relies upon me for that).

I know it seems like a lot, but I still have time for normal hobbies too. I play on a soccer team, run/compete in /r/SummerScavengerHunt, and I go hiking most weekends. The nice thing about posting things on reddit is that I can do it while lying on the couch watching Netflix after work. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hadn't seen that picture yet, but I do see a bit of myself hidden in the background there. 

The issue of swallowing is a very controversial vegan matter. Personally, I prefer to just let foods gradually slide down my throat instead of swallowing them. :P

As far as activism goes, I think we should try to engage in some activism that pushes us outside of our normal comfort zone. In one of my other comments I described one of our volunteers who was incredibly reluctant to leaflet at first, but after seeing me do it and slowly wading into it herself, she was able to pass out quite a few leaflets. 

There are lots of other things that people can do without having to talk to many people face to face though. Action For Animals puts out a lot of their literature in vegan/vegetarian friendly restaurants, and they are often looking for people who will help deliver this literature to local restaurants. Mercy for Animals also recommends writing letters to the editor as something that people can do. [Here is their guide on how to do it](http://www.mercyforanimals.org/action-center#letters). Another thing we can all do is engage in online activism by submitting content to Facebook or reddit, or commenting on reddit threads discussing animal issues.  </TEXT>

Over the next couple years I started using similar usernames for other sites and it eventually morphed into the current version. There isn't any particular deeper meaning I have associated with it, it is just the handle I have become accustomed to using on the internet.

<TEXT> I think /u/squeek502's answer is probably more reassuring than anything I can say. He came out to one of the shows and helped out all day. We distributed a record amount of literature that day (more than Action For Animals had ever gotten out at any single event in the past). 

In my experience people are much more receptive to leaflets than anyone would expect. When you walk up to people 65% will take a leaflet and say "thank you", 33% will politely turn you down, 1% will say "I like meat", and 1% will be curious and will ask a couple more questions about the information you're distributing.

I have passed out about 50,000 leaflets throughout all of my activism. Never have I had anyone attack me personally, and for every discouraging comment I have had many more positive ones. My experiences with outreach have always been rewarding overall and left me feeling very good at the end of the day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> People were very receptive everywhere we went. I do notice small differences between shows. The people attending the show in Oklahoma City tended to be notably heavier than people in other cities, and Houston had the most people who said "I like meat" and walked off when offered some information. The biggest difference was how hot and humid it got after we left California. Mesa, Arizona was 114 degrees while we were there and Texas and Oklahoma shows were near 100 degrees with very high humidity. It made keeping our energy up a lot harder, but I still did my best to put on a big smile and shout at every kid walking by our table (it is very loud so shouting is the only way to be heard). 

Overall though, everywhere we go people tend to be supportive and receptive, and the large majority of our conversations are positive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am very much an introvert myself. I would normally avoid big concerts like this because I generally don't enjoy things with large groups of people. That said, I have largely overcome my shyness that I had before going vegan, so I can confidently approach people and start a conversation, even if I wouldn't go to these events for fun.

One of our daily volunteers was terrified of leafleting at first. I asked her to at least come out with me to leaflet the line. At first she hid behind a tree and watched me handing leaflets to people. Then I talked her into stepping out a bit more, and finally got her to hold some leaflets and offer them to the people next to the people I had already approached and handed leaflets to. Within an hour or so she was walking up to people more or less on her own and handing them leaflets. 

[Vegan Outreach](http://veganoutreach.org/contact/) does a lot of leafleting at events and college campuses. If you contact them, they will be happy to let you know when an experienced leafleter will be in your area and how you can get involved with helping them. 

[Mercy for Animals](http://www.mercyforanimals.org/get-involved) has several ideas for ways people can get involved on their website. Another easy way to get involved is with [FARM's 10 Billion Lives Tour](http://www.10billiontour.org/volunteer) (paying people to watch a 4 minute video on factory farming). 

In addition to real world activism, we can all share things online that can reach huge numbers of people with a pro-animal rights message. [Here is a resource where you can quickly see where people are mentioning the word "vegan" on reddit](http://metareddit.com/monitor/PGfXV/vegan/). You can also find content that helps promote animal rights and help submit it to other subreddits. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see an important role for both within the animal rights movement. People are more charitable when talking to someone face to face that they can see and identify with. We can pick up on social cues that may not be available online and better tailor our responses to people.

Online we have the advantage of being able to cite sources, and have our comments or posts seen by a much wider audience. [Here is a link that I posted the day I left on my trip](http://imgur.com/nsFUwJ1). It has been viewed 3.1 million times. I could never reach that many people in person, but online I have been able to post share several items a month that get over a million views. These images can't replace a full conversation with someone, but they have absolutely succeeded in starting many conversations and giving many people a slight nudge in the direction of veganism. 

If I was choosing which area I think we can make a larger impact with the same amount of effort, I would say online activism, if done well, is a better use of most people's efforts at this time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lot of people came up to the table saying they were interested in going vegan and asked us for tips on how to do that. So, by being there I think there is a good chance that we got them to take the final leap, but I hardly count that as a conversion. 

When we got people to approach the table I would generally start by asking them if they were vegan, vegetarian, or just interested (I phrased it this way because it seems like I am giving them a choice, but no matter what they answer it sounds like they are on the side of cutting back on animal products). If people said "just interested" I would encourage them to give up more animal products and consider going vegetarian. If they said they were vegetarian then I would push them toward veganism by saying something like.

Have you ever considered moving toward veganism? I'm sure you're aware that the conditions for egg laying hens and dairy cows are every bit as terrible as for animals raised for meat. I totally get that going vegan can seem daunting, I was very hesitant myself to make the switch at first. It means cutting out all these foods from your diet, and you don't know what is going to replace them yet. I've been vegan for seven years and now I just go to the supermarket like anyone else and pick up the foods I like, as anyone else would, but when I was first making the change it was definitely more difficult. 

One thing we recommend to people is to consider committing to cutting out all animal products from your diet 1-2 days a week. That way you can start finding new foods and alternatives that you enjoy and from there it becomes much easier to do 3,4,5 days a week after that!

The conversation varied a bit from person to person (they would usually give some of their own feedback in between my comments). I think the approach I used was very effective (I could tell people responded very positively to it), but because I didn't ever say to go outright vegan right away I didn't hear many people say they were going to do that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Here are some pictures showing what our outreach looked like at a typical show](http://imgur.com/a/Cqay4). We also leafleted the line every morning before each show. On a typical day we distributed 3,000-5,000 pieces of literature, engaged in a couple hundred conversations, and raised between $800 and $2,000 for the non-profit Action for Animals. Several other redditors came for a day to help volunteer with us (I'll let them decide if they want to expose themselves). I had a lot of people tell me that they went vegetarian or vegan from something they had heard/read/seen at a prior year's Warped Tour show. 

One thing I noticed is that for many of our volunteers this was their first time engaging in any activism. They all did a great job, and their talents, if applied effectively, could spare the lives of hundreds of thousands even millions of animals. If you have any questions about getting involved in animal rights activism, please ask!

<TEXT> One of the top redditors (1,000,000 karma) who mods some of the default subs said this in /r/centuryclub:

We don't know the details of her removal, and frankly, shouldn't. Encouraging tamper tantrums by blacking out subreddits is tantamount to the tamper tantrum the users threw when FPH occurred. 

/u/chooter was incredible in every instance of my interactions with her, but that still doesn't mean I should know why she was let go from her position or that I should make a hissy fit about something I don't know anything about.

I do believe the reddit staff handled the timing poorly, but that doesn't change the sentiment in any way.

Reddit is a community that we all enjoy. By tanking this site we are also losing out.

The people who run reddit (admins) do have some responsibilities to the community, but reddit is a site designed to make it up to us as users to provide the content that we enjoy, independent of assistance from the admins. 

I can see the value in some protest to voice the concerns of the community, but by now those concerns have been heard. The admins undoubtedly think this is very serious. It is time to open up subreddits again so that the protest doesn't unnecessarily continue to inconvenience us (the users). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ultimately ethical veganism is a boycott intended to lessen the demand for animal products. Other animals do not possess all of the capacities that a typical human would have, but they show responses that appear quite similar to our own reactions to suffering when treated in many of the ways that would cause us to suffer.

[Utilitarianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) is a common school of ethical thought amongst vegans. Utilitarians view an action as good if it maximizes the amount of goodness (generally judged as increasing pleasure or happiness, and minimizing pain or suffering) that is expected to occur as a result. While many ethical vegans will openly admit that they enjoy the taste of meat (evidenced by the numerous meat alternatives available for vegans today), they recognize that the harm caused to other animals to produce these products almost certainly exceeds the pleasure they gain as a result. The boycott that is veganism lessens demand for these products, and correspondingly supply will decrease as a result.

Another way of expressing this is in the principle of [equal consideration of interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests). That is to say that the interest of any individual should be given equal consideration where, and to the extent that the interest exists. This isn't to say that all interests are equal, experienced equally, or that all animals possess interests, but that where there are interests, we should weight that interest proportionally to the intensity of the interest and not discriminate on any other basis. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The animals being raised for food suffer immensely, and there are far more of them suffering and dying each year than there are dogs and cats that we care for. If you care about animals it only makes sense to address the area where the vast majority of animals are suffering.

If you don't think you can go 100% vegetarian right away then you can still cut out most of the meat you are eating from your diet. Tell your parents that you would like to avoid meat, and they will likely be more accommodating too. Even when you are eating out or with friends you will be surprised by how often you can find meat-free options if you look for them. You can easily have a huge impact in lessening animal suffering with only a minor effort to choose more animal-friendly options.

Finally, keep in mind that you can stop eating meat, and don't hesitate to go fully vegetarian when you are ready. You may find that many of your peers are already doing it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Full Quote:

Just how destructive does a culinary preference have to be before we decide to eat something else? If contributing to the suffering of billions of animals that live miserable lives and (quite often) die in horrific ways isn't motivating, what would be? If being the number one contributor to the most serious threat facing the planet (global warming) isn't enough, what is? And if you are tempted to put off these questions of conscience, to say not now, then when?

As far as tools go, I use a tool called [Reddit Scheduler](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reddit-scheduler/ekdpobinhbpdigokooncmmmamhmjfigl?hl=en) to get links to post at the times I want them to. It gets the job done 80% of the time, but 20% it will mess something up and not post anything else until I uninstall and reinstall it. It is also generally inconvenient to use, but it is the only thing I have found for making a lot of posts to reddit at the times I want. It would save me some trouble if someone made something better.

I also use [Reddit Later](http://www.redditlater.com/analysis/) to tell me when the best times to submit to a subreddit is. Unfortunately it just looks at when the most popular posts were submitted, which is a bit different from what time I should submit a link to get the most karma. It also tends to have a small sample size for a lot of subreddit since it only looks at posts since the first of the month. Improving upon this tool would also help. </TEXT>

I'm actually taking a bit of a break from reddit for the next 10 days to do some real world activism, so I won't be on much. I hope you all cover for me in my absence.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The majority of soy and corn being grown today is fed to livestock. You can't get more calories out of a slaughtered animal than you fed to it originally.

Answer me, Mechanist, has Nature arranged all the springs of feeling in this animal to the end that he might not feel?" -Voltaire </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-18 17:00:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Full Quote:

Hold then the same view of the dog which has lost his master, which has sought him in all the thoroughfares with cries of sorrow, which comes into the house troubled and restless, goes downstairs, goes upstairs; goes from room to room, finds at last in his study the master he loves, and betokens his gladness by soft whimpers, frisks, and caresses. 

There are barbarians who seize this dog, who so greatly surpasses man in fidelity and friendship, and nail him down to a table and dissect him alive, to show you the Mesaraic veins! You discover in him all the same organs of feeling as in yourself. Answer me, Mechanist, has Nature arranged all the springs of feeling in this animal to the end that he might not feel? Has he nerves that he may be incapable of suffering? Do not suppose that impertinent contradiction in Nature.

-Voltaire, *Dictionnaire philosophique portatif* (1764)

Explanation: In the 17th Century, Ren Descartes had advocated the idea that animals were mere automatons, or complex machines, and that lacking a soul they could not suffer. Followers of Descartes ideas, who Voltaire and others referred to as Mechanists, conducted gruesome experiments on animals with little consideration for the unimaginable misery the animals were forced to endure. The quote above was Voltaires response to those who were conducting these experiments with no consideration for the well-being of the animals involved. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There have been many times when scientific ideas have been censored in a similar fashion because people didn't like the conclusions. Far too many people today view philosophy as mere opinions, but whether they like it or not there are factual statements that can be made about individual wellbeing and the consequences our actions have upon others. Not everyone will agree with Singer's views, but he at least makes a good attempt to back up his views with solidly supported evdence on what the consequences of our actions will be, and is open to being shown that he is wrong if better evidence suggests otherwise. Censoring a world-renowned philosopher like Singer is a disappointing short term setback for philosophy, but as we have seen with controversial science, even with strong opposition accurate ideas win out in the end. </TEXT>

Every single time they come back with video showing horrifying conditions and terrible mistreatment. Even the industry acknowledges that mutilations like dehorning, debeaking, tail docking, and castration all without anesthesia are common. We know that many animals are kept in battery cages and gestation crates and those that aren't are rarely afforded much more space. Nobody should be able to buy these products anymore without acknowledging that they are paying to support animal cruelty. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You continue repeating those same poorly designed studies and misrepresenting the conclusions of others despite being shown the flaws several times.

There is overwhelming consensus among dietary experts that appropriately planned vegetarian and vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life. You are like someone who keeps pointing to "gaps" in the fossil record as evidence that evolution did not occur.

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The eggs that you eat are not fertilized so there is no need to worry about any baby chickens inside the eggs.

However, there are baby chickens dying in another sense. Male chickens do not lay eggs, and the males of the egg laying variety do not grow fast enough to be worth raising for meat either. These chickens are commonly ground up alive [as can be seen in this short video clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huVJDWaKrxM) or explained in more detail [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN0g13kMk6s). Some other places may simply throw the birds into large trash bags to suffocate.

The hens themselves frequently live in terrible conditions even in facilities that try to advertise themselves as being more humane. [Here are pictures of free-range, cage-free, and organic egg laying operations](http://imgur.com/a/fp7C0). Even on the nicest farms though, the hens' egg production begins to drop off after a couple years of age and they will be sent to slaughter. There is no economic way to let these animals live out their entire lives. [Here is a picture showing how old various animals usually are when slaughtered](http://i.imgur.com/LLyM10R.jpg).

The story for dairy is much the same as with eggs. Cows only give significant amounts of milk for a period of time after birth, so they are repeatedly impregnated to keep up the milk production. The males do not produce milk, so they are separated from their mothers shortly after birth. Cows suffer greatly when separated from their young. [Here you can see a video of a mother cow crying for her calf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBnZPJJ2QG4). The male calves will be slaughtered and sold as veal.

Once again the milk production of dairy cows also drops off after a few years. As shown in the image above, they will also be sent to slaughter at a fraction of their natural life span. </TEXT>

EDIT: Also, how do you think the conclusion "The risks of feeding this excess protein don't seem to apply here" supports your claim that there is "growing evidence that meat is necessary for infant development?" The conclusion as written supports that idea that meat won't necessarily have a negative impact on infant health. </TEXT>

I am citing the position papers that the world's largest dietetic organizations have published on the subject of vegetarian and vegan diets.

<TEXT> **Objective:** We examined the effect of protein from meat as **complementary foods** on growth and metabolic profiles of breastfed infants.

**Design:** This was a secondary analysis from a trial in which exclusively breastfed infants (56 mo old from the Denver, CO, metro area) were randomly assigned to receive commercially available pureed meats (Meat group; n = 14) or infant cereal (Cereal group; n = 28) as their primary complementary feedings for 5 mo. 

It says there that the pureed meats and infant cereal were complementary to the breast feeding the infants were receiving. Did you read that and think that the mothers were eating pureed meats and infant cereal?

Also, something else you may have missed when you (didn't carefully) read these studies:

**Background:** High intake of cow-milk protein in formula-fed infants is associated with higher weight gain and increased adiposity, which have led to recommendations to limit protein intake in later infancy.

The study is stating that the excess weight and fat that infants gain from consuming dairy formula is a bad thing after the first few months (which is what this study was looking at). </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is not growing evidence. You cited a handful of individual studies that were not looking at vegetarian or vegan diets as a whole.

For example your first study has a sample size of 14 infants fed meat and 28 infants fed cereal. It concluded that their meat diet had more protein than the cereal diet therefore the protein contributed to more growth. If they had fed a higher protein non-meat food, then they would expect the non-meat food to contribute to more growth. 

Compare that to the American Dietetic Association's position paper that cites over 200 studies to support their position. My sources are reputable experts in the dietary field that have conducted reviews of all the literature. It is not some study that you or I are trying to take out of context to support our position. Can you find a similarly reputable organization that has reviewed all of the literature and come to a conclusion that supports your position? </TEXT>

<TEXT> A substantial number of animals in slaughterhouses are not stunned properly by the captive bolt guns that are commonly used, and continue down the kill lines fully conscious. 

Many meat eaters also eat Halal or Kosher meats as well as chickens that are killed without any stunning, but simply have their necks slit and are allowed to painfully bleed out while fully conscious. 

Another fairly common technique is controlled atmospheric killing. [Here you can see footage of that process from Australia's largest pig slaughterhouse](https://youtu.be/KArL5YjaL5U?t=1h23m13s).

Speaking hypothetically, if someone kills one animal to send a message, and in turn convinces others to change their behavior enough to save 10 animals from suffering in ways like that shown in the footage above, would you consider their action justified? </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is overwhelming consensus that meat is not necessary for a healthy diet.

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. </TEXT>

People in our position who continue to eat meat are supporting the unnecessary slaughter of animals just as much as the radio show host did. </TEXT>

Whenever you see these stories, please consider making a donation to a group doing actual work to help animals. [Here are charities that Animal Charity Evaluators has recommended as the most effective for helping animals](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/recommendations/).

<TEXT> There is more to determining how we ought to behave than simply stating what you like. We need to consider the impact our actions have on all impacted parties. In the case of consuming animal products there is a great deal of harm caused to the animals who live short lives in captivity and are slaughtered for food.

Protein is not exclusive to animal products. There is overwhelming consensus that appropriately planned vegetarian and vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life. Vegan foods like beans, rice, and peanut butter are some of the cheapest sources of protein available.

<TEXT> Plus add on top of that the whole correlation is not equal to causation thing.

Every major dietetic association in the world agrees that appropriately planned vegetarian and vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life. Yes, you need to pay attention to what you eat in order to make sure you are eating healthy, but that is the case regardless of whether or not you are vegetarian.

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't let the negative comments bother you. Veganism isn't about some dogmatic avoidance of anything relating to kingdom animalia. It is about minimizing the harm our actions cause to animals as much as possible and practicable. If an animal does not possess the neurological capacity to be harmed in any meaningful sense then it is perfectly vegan to use/eat it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> EU countries import 35 million tons of soy beans and soy meal from north and south America every year - to use as feed for pigs, chickens and cows.

Cultivation of primarily genetically modified soy for export uses land in developing countries that could go toward sustainable agriculture.

But even in industrialized countries like Germany, globalized industrial livestock farming presents a pollution problem.

"[Animal waste] is the root of considerable environmental problems in Germany, particularly in regions with intensive livestock farming," explained agrarian economist Knut Ehlers of the German Environment Agency.

Although manure is also a fertilizer, too much is toxic for soil and water. The environmental impacts of factory farming "ultimately fall on the taxpayer," said Ehlers.

Such agriculture is unsustainable, Ehlers stressed. He hopes that aiming more public attention to the issue of soil depletion on the national and EU levels will lead to more sustainable policy-making, and development of organic agriculture.

[Source](http://www.dw.de/loss-of-fertile-soils-a-food-security-risk/a-18395856)

Plant farms are taking on a part of the issue of the overwhelming amount of excessive manure and waste generated by animal agriculture, and yet you are trying to throw them under the bus for not being entirely self-reliant? We have many other fertilizer options available. Be grateful that these farms take on some of the waste that you create. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a utilitarian, I am going to say that the action would be justified if the benefit to you exceeds the harm to animals, and if it is the available option that maximizes the benefit and minimizes harm.

I think you would be hard pressed to find many real-world scenarios where raising animals oneself or hunting them in the sense that you are likely imagining would meet those criteria. However, I will say that hunting oysters, which are animals with very limited nervous systems as adults, could very well be justified. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You went from a bad justification to a terrible justification. It is not okay to pay people to abuse animals and slaughter them just because you enjoy it. You need to take into account both your enjoyment as well as the harm your actions cause to others in order to make an ethical decision.

The food chain is not an ethical theory (and you won't be any more likely to get eaten by other animals if you choose to eat less meat). 

There is no reason to say reactionary nonsense just because you don't like what /u/The_Same_Sun was saying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Every major group of dietary experts in the world agrees that appropriately planned vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life. Any type of diet can be dangerous if not planned appropriately.

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

Whether or not you or I believe something has no impact on whether or not it is true. 

We should weigh the impact to people who raise and slaughter animals for a living in determining how we ought to behave (we should weigh the impact our actions have on everyone in determining how we ought to behave), but you can't argue in good faith that taking the lives of hundreds of thousands or millions of birds causes less harm than a chicken farmer having to make changes to their career. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you are looking for specific studies the ADA position paper cites over 200 studies to back up their position. There are also many other major dietary groups that agree with their position.

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

Whenever you see these stories, please consider making a donation to a group doing actual work to help animals. [Here are charities that Animal Charity Evaluators has recommended as the most effective for helping animals](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/recommendations/).

<TEXT> Do you think dairy farms actually keep cows around until they die of old age? Cows' milk production drops off as they age. Every dairy farm sends cows to slaughter.

[From Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle):

Domestic cows can live to 20 years, however those raised for dairy rarely live that long, as the average cow is removed from the dairy herd around age four and marketed for beef.

On top of this cows, like all mammals, only produce significant amounts of milk for a period after they have had a calf (they are inseminated on dairy farms to have about one calf per year according to Wikipedia). The male calves are of no use to the dairy industry, and are typically slaughtered for veal. So the slaughter of cattle is also supported in that sense by dairy consumption. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Every major group of dietary experts in the world agrees that appropriately planned vegetarian and vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life.

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think this is an issue that needs to be approached from a utilitarian perspective. There certainly are benefits that can come from any sort of research, particularly medical research. On the other hand, experimenting on animals almost certainly causes them a great deal of misery. 

We ought to make every effort to minimize the harm caused by any experiment, maximize the expected benefit, and only allow experiments to be conducted if the expected benefit exceeds the expected amount of harm caused. 

That said, we presently tend to have a terrible bias of underestimating the harm our actions cause to non-human animals. At the same time there is no reason why this should only apply to non-human animals either. Humans are much better test subjects for studying human diseases. If we would gain far better knowledge by breeding humans to test upon instead of breeding chimpanzees and both groups would suffer much the same from an experiment, then there is no reasonable excuse for not testing on the humans.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Final Result](http://i.imgur.com/5lqqrct.jpg)

**Ingredients**

* A generous pinch cumin seeds
* 2 smallish waxy potatoes, peeled, quartered and sliced thinly across
* 5 fat cloves garlic, peeled and chopped
* 4 small bittergourds, topped, tailed, halved, seeds and pith scraped out then sliced thickly across
* Half a large daikon radish, peeled, quartered and sliced thinly across
* 3-4 fresh green chillies, sliced thickly across
* A generous pinch hot red pepper flakes
* 1 can thoroughly drained cooked chickpeas
* 1 level tsp sea salt (or to taste)
 
**Directions**

1. Heat about 3 tablespoons light vegetable oil (sunflower, soy, canola etc) in a deep pan or wok. When moderately hot, add the cumin seeds and stir for a few seconds, taking care that they don't burn.

2. Add the sliced potatoes and cook, stirring until potatoes begin to crisp. Add the garlic and continue to stir until garlic begins to brown.

3. Add in the sliced bittergourds and cook, stirring until they begin to brown at the edges. Stir in the sliced daikon and green chillies and cook, stirring often for about 3 minutes or until vegetables are almost done but still have some crunch.
Add the red pepper flakes, chickpeas and salt and stir for about 2 - 3 minutes or until chickpeas are thoroughly heated through.

4. Dish out and garnish with cilantro if you like. Serve immediately. </TEXT>

**Ingredients**

* A generous pinch cumin seeds
* 2 smallish waxy potatoes, peeled, quartered and sliced thinly across
* 5 fat cloves garlic, peeled and chopped
* 4 small bittergourds, topped, tailed, halved, seeds and pith scraped out then sliced thickly across
* Half a large daikon radish, peeled, quartered and sliced thinly across
* 3-4 fresh green chillies, sliced thickly across
* A generous pinch hot red pepper flakes
* 1 can thoroughly drained cooked chickpeas
* 1 level tsp sea salt (or to taste)
 
**Directions**

1. Heat about 3 tablespoons light vegetable oil (sunflower, soy, canola etc) in a deep pan or wok. When moderately hot, add the cumin seeds and stir for a few seconds, taking care that they don't burn.

2. Add the sliced potatoes and cook, stirring until potatoes begin to crisp. Add the garlic and continue to stir until garlic begins to brown.

3. Add in the sliced bittergourds and cook, stirring until they begin to brown at the edges. Stir in the sliced daikon and green chillies and cook, stirring often for about 3 minutes or until vegetables are almost done but still have some crunch.
Add the red pepper flakes, chickpeas and salt and stir for about 2 - 3 minutes or until chickpeas are thoroughly heated through.

4. Dish out and garnish with cilantro if you like. Serve immediately. </TEXT>

<TEXT> PETA is certainly a group with significant shortcomings, but lets not forget that this campaign against PETA is driven by an industry lobbyist group, the [Center for Consumer Freedom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Consumer_Freedom), with the goal of conflating PETA with animal rights and setting the entire cause back.

Whenever you see these stories, please consider making a donation to a group doing actual work to help animals. [Here are charities that Animal Charity Evaluators has recommended as the most effective for helping animals](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/recommendations/). PETA does not deserve your money, but animals should not be left to suffer because industry funded interests want to shut their opponents up entirely.

Despite the title, the essay is quite clear that it is not arguing for all animals to be treated exactly the same. Singer is arguing for the principle of [Equal Consideration of Interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests), which means that to the extent and degree that any being possesses interests their interests should be given consideration to the same extent and degree as any other being with similar interests, and we ought not discriminate on any other basis. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is overwhelming consensus among dietitians that appropriately planned vegetarian and vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life. The only people who could be called "fanatics" in this scenario are those that reject the scientific consensus.

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I run a fun, small subreddit: /r/SummerScavengerHunt. Every year on June 1st we share a scavenger hunt list. Participants post photos and videos of themselves finding items or completing tasks from the scavenger hunt list (last year's list can be found in the sidebar) and then the moderators award points to your team if the submission meets the criteria (teams can be one or two people). 

Here are some of the items people submitted for last year's scavenger hunt:

[#89 A drink with a phallic name that isn't Bawls](http://i.imgur.com/Lnmg5mh.jpg)

[#142 Someone in a banana suit](http://i.imgur.com/3x3JG8Z.jpg)

[#165 A banknote with a denomination larger than 1,000,000](http://i.imgur.com/K5fmlLE.jpg)

[#202 Make a pair of ice skates by attaching ice to the bottom of your shoes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaXsKrmg4io feature=youtu.be)

[#260 Feed an animal (besides a human) a carrot out of your mouth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_qerX9uuK0 feature=youtu.be)

It would be great to have some more participants this year, so please join in the competition! </TEXT>

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

<TEXT> That's unfortunate that your wife is struggling with anemia. Clearly her current meat heavy diet isn't sufficient to meet her needs. While taking iron supplements is probably a good start, there are many other factors that can increase or decrease iron absorption (for example consuming vitamin C with iron will increase absorption, while foods containing phytic acid will decrease absorption). There is no reason why she would have to rely upon meat as a superior source of iron. 

Finally, nobody is pushing anything upon you by simply writing something on the internet. Feminists aren't forcing their beliefs upon others when they say that women should receive equal pay for equal work or when they say all women should have the opportunity to receive a basic education. As Elie Wiesel famously wrote: 

We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere.

The people who are pushing their beliefs on others are those who are forcing animals to live lives in terrible conditions of confinement and who force these animals to ultimately be slaughtered for their meals.   </TEXT>

That said, following the sort of diet you propose is still vastly outside of mainstream dietary advice (despite being perfectly possible as a vegan). 

The American Dietetic Association addresses Omega-3s in their position paper. I'm much more inclined to trust the world's most prominent dietetic organization on the subject (who also cites peer reviewed research to back up their position) than I am inclined to take your word on it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Every major dietary organization in the world has published statements saying appropriately planned vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life. Anyone who rejects that is radically outside of the overwhelming scientific consensus.

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

**INGREDIENTS**

Mushrooms: 

* 2 portobello mushrooms, sliced
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 tbsp. olive oil
* 2 tbsp. balsamic vinegar
*  tsp. salt

Dough:

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 tsp. instant dry yeast
* 1 tsp. sugar
* 1 tsp. salt
*  cup warm water (105-115F)
* 2 tbsp. olive oil 

Guacamole:

* 3 large avocados, ripe (soft not squishy)
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
*  lime
* 1 small tomato, diced
*  red onion, diced
* Salt


**Instructions: ** 

Guacamole: 

1. Cut your avocados in half and remove pit. Spoon out avocado into a medium bowl. Add in garlic, salt, and freshly squeezed lime. Mash avocado until smooth. Add the tomatoes and onion, stirring until combined. Cover and refrigerator until chilled, probably a good hour. Give it a taste test to see if it needs more salt or lime.

Mushrooms:

1. Preheat oven to 425F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Toss the portobellos in a large mixing bowl with the olive oil, salt, balsamic vinegar, and garlic. Mix gently until combined and all mushrooms are coated. Place onto baking sheet and cook for 15 minutes. Remove and set aside.

Crust:

1. Add the water and oil to the bowl of your stand mixer. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, yeast, and salt. Attach the dough hook to your stand mixer and start the mixer on low. Carefully add the flour mixture to the wet mixture, increasing the speed of the mixer as needed. Mix until the dough forms a ball and clears the sides of the mixer.
2. Lightly flour your counter. Place the dough on top and knead until smooth and elastic, between 5-7 minutes. Lightly grease the bowl of your stand mixer and set the dough inside, rotating the bowl so the dough becomes coated in oil. Cover and set aside for 1 hour (or until dough has doubled in size.)
3. When ready to use, preheat oven to 475F. Deflate the dough by punching it and pouring onto your floured countertops. Roll out into a large size pizza crust and place onto your pizza pan. Brush dough with olive oil and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until golden brown and desired consistency is reached.

Pizza assembly:

1. Spread the guacamole across your COOKED pizza dough. Once smooth, top with the portobello mushrooms. Cut and serve! </TEXT>

I went vegan after receiving a leaflet on the horrors of the animal industry. This was handed to me four years ago, when I visited my cousin's college. I would like to pay this forward now by taking a more active role in animal advocacy at my university. I recently realized that to be the best vegan I can, I have to change not just myself, but influence others as well. With The Humane League's resources and support, I will enthusiastically work to increase people's knowledge on the environmental and ethical problems of animal farming, and hopefully spur them to action--and to veganism! </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are plenty of people who give up on their vegetarianism, and hopefully seeing a reminder of why being vegetarian is so important will encourage people to maintain their vegetarianism. Furthermore, simply being vegetarian isn't everything that we can be doing to help these animals. We can donate to animal rights groups, get involved in animal rights activism, cut dairy and eggs out of our diets, and much more. Hopefully people here who already care about these issues will do more to help after seeing just how tragic videos like this are, not just for this one cow, but for millions of other similar cows. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been vegan for the past 7 years. Ultimately ethical veganism is a boycott intended to lessen the demand for animal products. Other animals do not possess all of the capacities that a typical human would have, but they show responses that appear quite similar to our own reactions to suffering when treated in many of the ways that would cause us to suffer.

[Utilitarianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) is a common school of ethical thought amongst vegans. Utilitarians view an action as good if it maximizes the amount of goodness (generally judged as increasing pleasure or happiness, and minimizing pain or suffering) that is expected to occur as a result. While many ethical vegans will openly admit that they enjoy the taste of meat (evidenced by the numerous meat alternatives available for vegans today), they recognize that the harm caused to other animals to produce these products almost certainly exceeds the pleasure they gain as a result. The boycott that is veganism lessens demand for these products, and correspondingly supply will decrease as a result.

Another way of expressing this is in the principle of [equal consideration of interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests). That is to say that the interest of any individual should be given equal consideration where, and to the extent that the interest exists. This isn't to say that all interests are equal, experienced equally, or that all animals possess interests, but that where there are interests, we should weight that interest proportionally to the intensity of the interest and not discriminate on any other basis. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am interested in interning with The Humane League because I was recently exposed to issues of farm animal cruelty when someone was handing out leaflets on my college campus. The leaflets included information about the abuse farm animals suffer and a quote about how it's odd that we cuddle some animals (our pets) but stick forks in others (farm animals). I have always been an animal lover and have been trying to become vegetarian for years, but this really hit home with me and I have become vegetarian. I think that spreading awareness about animal cruelty is the most efficient way to get people to understand it, as many people are unaware of the cruelty that occurs. I would love to be part of an organization that works to fight against this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is overwhelming consensus that humans can be healthy on vegan diets. Once again, who cares if it is "natural" or not?

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We also don't commonly live to 80 years old in nature. We all benefit greatly from fortified foods like iodized salt, enriched flour, and fortified cereals. It is also recommended that [all pregnant women take a folic acid supplement](http://www.webmd.com/baby/folic-acid-and-pregnancy). We can, and already are doing things much better than nature thanks to supplements and fortified foods, and many other unnatural aspects of modern life.

On the other hand, humans have engaged in tribal violence for all of recorded history and we even see signs of it among other great apes, so war and violence seem very natural, but I think we would both agree that they are not good.

Simply stating whether or not something is natural tells us nothing about whether we ought to continue doing it going forward. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep! There is wide consensus on this point!

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I run a fun, small subreddit: /r/SummerScavengerHunt. Every year on June 1st we share a scavenger hunt list. Participants post photos and videos of themselves finding items or completing tasks from the scavenger hunt list and then the moderators award points to your team if the submission meets the criteria (teams can be one or two people). 

Here are some of the items people submitted for last year's scavenger hunt:

[#89 A drink with a phallic name that isn't Bawls](http://i.imgur.com/Lnmg5mh.jpg)

[#142 Someone in a banana suit](http://i.imgur.com/3x3JG8Z.jpg)

[#165 A banknote with a denomination larger than 1,000,000](http://i.imgur.com/K5fmlLE.jpg)

[#202 Make a pair of ice skates by attaching ice to the bottom of your shoes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaXsKrmg4io feature=youtu.be)

[#260 Feed an animal (besides a human) a carrot out of your mouth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_qerX9uuK0 feature=youtu.be)

It would be great to have some more participants this year, so please subscribe and join in the competition! </TEXT>

<TEXT> In circumstances where no harm is caused to animals to produce an animal product then I have no ethical issue with using it. You will find this is frequently repeated position amongst vegans. For example, [here is an article about how it is ethical for vegans to eat oysters](http://sentientist.org/2013/05/20/the-ethical-case-for-eating-oysters-and-mussels/) (you can find several more articles along these lines with a Google search), and [here you can find an essay from Ingrid Newkirk about how she is excited to eat lab grown meat](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/04/20/magazine/ethics-eating-meat.html?_r=0).

I think with a little research you will quickly see that cruelty is still inherent in any commercial production of wool and eggs. I would say we don't understand the experiences of bees very well, but it is quite plausible given our current understanding that they suffer greatly as well. 

Finally, meat isn't going to be abolished tomorrow. Hopefully, demand for meat will decline down the road and fewer animals will be bred into existence to meet the lower demand. There are still wild or feral chickens, boars, and cattle living in several parts of the world, so their existence will continue. If down the road there comes a time when a majority of our society wishes to abolish meat then we can decide whether to outlaw the breeding of new farmed animals and allow the others to still be slaughtered or if we desire to invest in providing safe living conditions for the farm animals who are alive at that time to safely live out their lives. Stopping the mistreatment of animals for human consumption is not an insurmountable hurdle. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This really just goes to show your lack of understanding of why people choose to be vegan. While buying organic is completely unrelated to being vegan we are well aware that manure is often used as a fertilizer. 

Being vegan isn't about some dogmatic avoidance of any product with some arbitrary connection that can be drawn to some animal product. The Vegan Society (which coined the term "vegan") defines veganism as:

Veganism is a way of living that seeks to exclude, as far as possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing and any other purpose.

Veganism is about minimizing the harm we cause to others, which is a cause that most sensible people would get behind. </TEXT>

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. </TEXT>

He is also doing a lot of other great animal rights activism work, such as having now passed out over 100,000 Vegan Outreach booklets on college campuses! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I certainly appreciated meat. I ate a lot of meat growing up and enjoyed the taste as much as anyone.

Unfortunately, just because something is natural doesn't mean that it is ethical. For example, humans have waged war for millennia. We even see tribal clashes between different groups of great apes. Could anything be more natural? Yet I think we can both recognize that despite being natural we both would condemn unnecessary warfare.

To determine if something is ethical we must look at both the benefits (such as my enjoyment of meat), and the negatives (the harm caused to other animals). As much as I enjoyed the taste of meat, there was little doubt that the harm caused to other animals outweighed these benefits in almost all cases. (One exception might be a food like oysters. While they are technically animals they possess a very minimal nervous system.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Vegans are actually largely supporting and even funding the push for synthetic meat. [Here is an essay from Ingrid Newkirk](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/04/20/magazine/ethics-eating-meat.html?_r=0) (president of PETA. ^I ^know ^they ^suck ) about how she is excited to eat meat for the first time in 40 years once it can be synthesized.

As much as reddit likes to circlejerk about vegans needing to feel special that really isn't why people choose to be vegan.

<TEXT> We had a thread from an omni a couple weeks ago saying what a friendly and welcoming community they thought /r/vegan is. I have to say that I have found this community to live up to that reputation as well, and the only hatemongering I see is in posts that try to condemn us all with a single brush.

I do find your second paragraph to be quite telling however. Eating animal products is not merely a personal choice as it does not simply impact oneself. It causes harm to the animals being slaughtered and consumed as well. Vegans view this treatment of animals as being unethical. If you view every comment on the vegan subreddit that says "using animals in this way is wrong" as being hatemongering then it is hardly a surprise that you reach the conclusion that this subreddit is hateful.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Every major dietetic association in the world agrees that appropriately planned vegetarian and vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life.

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits.

Finally, I guarantee that you know some of [these famous vegans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_vegans) who look quite healthy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There isn't going to be any product on the market that tastes exactly identical to meat, but there certainly are products that are indistinguishable in certain settings. I have seen taste tests with vegan sausages and vegan ground meat where people were fed these alternatives and conventional meats and they were unable to identify which was which.

People's perception of these products also plays a strong role in how they will claim the products taste. I have seen research on protein bars where they fed people the bar with a wrapper that either said, "contains 9 grams of protein" or "contains 9 grams of soy protein". Despite the bars being identical, the people who received the "soy protein" wrapper rated the product as tasting much worse, but they perceived it as being healthier. 

There isn't anything on the market today that will replicate a 12 oz  chunk of steak, but there are indistinguishable alternatives for many of the settings in which people eat meat today, as long as you go into it without prejudiced expectations based upon knowing the product is vegan. In addition to this for the meats that are not yet being replicated, many of the vegan alternatives on the market are still delicious in their own right and can be a new food that many people would enjoy having added into their diet.

Finally, tastes vary from person to person, so the only way to really discover which foods you like best are to try them out for yourself. </TEXT>

Clearly you don't need to worry about becoming prey for another animal just because you have chosen to eat more plant-based foods. Your position in that sense is safe. </TEXT>

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was really reluctant to become vegan even after I found out more about how terribly animals are treated for dairy and egg production (and slaughtered all the same). I tried signing up on the Vegan Freak forums though since I really liked their podcast, but I told them that going vegan was too hard for me. They were a bunch of meanies and told me that my excuses sucked and that their forums were a safe place for vegans only.

I decided to give veganism a shot since I wanted to be a part of the forums, and 7 years later I couldn't be more happy that I did! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's the thing that people frequently miss when judging the environmental impact of local products versus far away products. If you buy steak or any other product from 5,000 miles away they aren't putting that one steak in a car and having someone drive it 5,000 miles. They are loading 10,000 lbs of product onto a truck/airplane and shipping all of that. If you bought 1lb of steak your portion of that is equivalent to roughly half a mile of transport. If you drove an extra 5 miles to find a place that sells locally sourced meat that is going to be roughly 10 times as harmful as buying the meat from across the country if you as an individual drive a shorter distance to pick it up.

Then again, none of this actually looks at how the animals are treated.  The places where lots of people live aren't able to produce lots of products that rely upon vast open land area to be produced. To meet a city's increasing demand for local products it is only possible if it becomes increasingly intensive and increasingly confined. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You should be upset. What they are doing is absolutely not okay. I'm sure their condesention and dismissive attitude is beyond frustrating as well. Don't try to get rid of that passion that you feel.

Keep in mind though that you aren't the one suffering. When reacting to your parents or anyone else think of what will be best for helping the animals, not what will feel most satisfying for you. Sometimes that might mean showing your frustration or telling someone off, but more often that means remaining cool and rational, acting like you understand where people are coming from, and presenting the animals' case in the most levelheaded way you can. </TEXT>

After years getting to know the personalities of the animals he raises, he questions whether it is right for him to go on in the industry. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

Vegans abuse less plants you idiot, the inefficiency of animals (80% at best, 5% at worst) means you will indirectly kill 20% to 95% more plants in your lifetime than the average vegan.

And before you insult me or accuse me of "Lol PETA asshole", I mod /r/anti_vegan, so you know you're an idiot when even somebody critical of veganism calls you out on your BULLSHIT.

And HOOOOOLY FUCK, it's funny how you people are outraged somebody lit a little animal on fire then instantly reduce said animal to the non-conciousness of plants in seconds, all to make yourselves feel better.

<TEXT>  A system of moral principles are views of right and wrong ~~enforce by a society~~. Since not eating meat is not enforced nor viewed as bad by society, it is by definition ethical.

Using that first definition your conclusion does not follow. 

The dictionary's example works that the ethics of a culture are a system of moral principles of a culture. That doesn't mean that the word can only refer to the moral principles of a culture or society. It refers, as the definition states, to a system of moral principles.

Your argument is being mocked on /r/badphilosophy. I don't think you can claim that vegans are the only ones who find holes in your reasoning.

<TEXT> [Dictionary.com definitions of "ethics"](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ethics?s=t)

1. (used with a singular or plural verb) a system of moral principles:
*the ethics of a culture.*


2. the rules of conduct recognized in respect to a particular class of human actions or a particular group, culture, etc.:
*medical ethics; Christian ethics.*

3. moral principles, as of an individual:
*His ethics forbade betrayal of a confidence.*

4. (usually used with a singular verb) that branch of philosophy dealing with values relating to human conduct, with respect to the rightness and wrongness of certain actions and to the goodness and badness of the motives and ends of such actions.

You seem to have used definition 2 as if it was the only definition. When clearly definition 1 fits far better for how the term is frequently used and used in the context to which you are attempting to respond. And definition 3 states that ethics and morals can be used interchangeably contrary to your entire argument. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Every major dietetic association in the world agrees that there is nothing wrong with feeding children a vegan diet.

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right now you are benefiting from eating countless fortified foods. Iodine deficiency has plummeted since the advent of iodized salt. You eat enriched flour and breakfast cereals fortified with dozens of vitamins and minerals. You can't recreate these things without relying on the store.

Other animals do not possess all of the capacities that a typical human would have, but they show responses that appear quite similar to our own reactions to suffering when treated in many of the ways that would cause us to suffer.

[Utilitarianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) is a common school of ethical thought amongst vegans. Utilitarians view an action as good if it maximizes the amount of goodness (generally judged as increasing pleasure or happiness, and minimizing pain or suffering) that is expected to occur as a result. While many ethical vegans will openly admit that they enjoy the taste of meat (evidenced by the numerous meat alternatives available for vegans today), they recognize that the harm caused to other animals to produce these products almost certainly exceeds the pleasure they gain as a result. The boycott that is veganism lessens demand for these products, and correspondingly supply will decrease as a result.

Another way of expressing this is in the principle of [equal consideration of interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests). That is to say that the interest of any individual should be given equal consideration where, and to the extent that the interest exists. This isn't to say that all interests are equal, experienced equally, or that all animals possess interests, but that where there are interests, we should weight that interest proportionally to the intensity of the interest and not discriminate on any other basis.

<TEXT> Thanks for citing the appropriate wikipedia article. I am doing all of this from my cell phone, so it is a bit tough to look things up. I have read the study you cited previously. I think you have failed to emphasize that none of the vegan cats were deficient in taurine, as well as to provide a reference for the proportion of cats on conventional food with low taurine levels. That said, the study does show that vegan cat owners could better protect their cats' health by choosing a vegan cat food with higher taurine.

I'm also not arguing that the cats will be the ones better off if they eat a vegan diet. Even if all 96 million cats died from a vegan diet, how many fewer animals would be slaughtered to become cat food if all cats were fed a vegan diet? You cannot choose the most ethical option for feeding your cat without considering all of the consequences of your choice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am saying it is better to choose the option that causes less harm to animals than the option that causes more harm. This is probably one of the  least controversial ethical statements anyone could make. 

It sounds like you are trying to describe a situation where more harm would be caused by letting the dog suffer and die than is caused to a snake to produce a single dose of antivenom. If that is the case I would say the less harmful option is the better one. If it were not the case I would still say the less harmful option is better. 

I am not saying that every scenario is clear cut or that I always know which option is less harmful. However, I have yet to see anyone even attempt to make the case that the animals being raised and slaughtered for cat food are harmed less than a cat would be even if it was fed the worst possible diet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Life You Can Save, and the other effective altruism work of yours that I have seen, seem to focus predominately on mitigating terrible cases of human suffering, which is undoubtedly an important cause. However, it seems quite likely that each of us can do much more with the same amount of resources to mitigate animal suffering. A good deal of your other work has addressed the issue of speciesism and the importance of animal rights in living an ethical life, but the work on effective altruism within the animal rights movement (for example the work done by [Animal Charity Evaluators](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/recommendations/top-charities/)) seems to be more of an afterthought. Why have you chosen to focus much more specifically on humans in your recent work? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The way you worded it doesn't really describe his position, but let me Google the answer for you:

Q. You have been quoted as saying: "Killing a defective infant is not morally equivalent to killing a person. Sometimes it is not wrong at all." Is that quote accurate? 

A. It is accurate, but can be misleading if read without an understanding of what I mean by the term person (which is discussed in Practical Ethics, from which that quotation is taken). I use the term "person" to refer to a being who is capable of anticipating the future, of having wants and desires for the future.  As I have said in answer to the previous question, I think that it is generally a greater wrong to kill such a being than it is to kill a being that has no sense of existing over time. Newborn human babies have no sense of their own existence over time. So killing a newborn baby is never equivalent to killing a person, that is, a being who wants to go on living.  That doesnt mean that it is not almost always a terrible thing to do.  It is, but that is because most infants are loved and cherished by their parents, and to kill an infant is usually to do a great wrong to its parents. 
Sometimes, perhaps because the baby has a serious disability, parents think it better that their newborn infant should die. Many doctors will accept their wishes, to the extent of not giving the baby life-supporting medical treatment.  That will often ensure that the baby dies.  My view is different from this, only to the extent that if a decision is taken, by the parents and doctors, that it is better that a baby should die, I believe it should be possible to carry out that decision, not only by withholding or withdrawing life-support  which can lead to the baby dying slowly from dehydration or from an infection - but also by taking active steps to end the babys life swiftly and humanely.

<TEXT> Someone else posted about blood type diets being BS. Here is the consensus about appropriately planned vegetarian and vegan diets being healthy for all stages of life:

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

<TEXT> Of course the legislature should only pass laws if there is a good reason for them. That isn't what this amendment is going to ensure. It will instead provide a basis for large agricultural interests to legally challenge laws they don't like in court. You wouldn't only need to convince a majority of legislators and the governor to pass a law, you also need to prove it to a judge, and if he or she sides with you then another judge on appeal. At the same time laws that favor big ag without good public reason will go unchallenged, and those that only hurt smaller farms that cannot afford the legal costs will go unchallenged too. This is an amendment designed to enshrine big business interests in the state's constitution. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Being natural is completely irrelevant. If humans had been having sex with animals for hundreds of thousands of years and it was more convenient for you to find an animal to have sex with than another human would it be okay then?

Meat isn't easy either. It takes time to cook, it comes with high risk of foodborne illness, most of the world considers it to be a luxury. [Soylent](http://www.soylent.me/) is a vegan option that is incredibly convenient (just add water). You can get nuts at any store, they keep well for long periods of time, and you can eat them right out of the container by the handful. Rice and beans are staples of the world's poor. There is no reason to eat meat other than the fact that you enjoy it despite the terrible harm caused to animals, which is the exact reasoning behind why people engage in the cruelty of having non-consensual sex with animals. </TEXT>

Whenever you see these stories, please consider making a donation to a group doing actual work to help animals.

When someone mentions that they're vegan reddit's response is, "how do you know someone is vegan? Don't worry they'll tell you." When someone doesn't mention that they're vegan you then try to call them out for not mentioning it.

It seems to me like some people just want to find a reason to get upset with vegans for simply existing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The effectiveness in terms of numbers of lives saved per dollar by the top charities on Animal Charity Evaluators are about 10,000 times those of the top charities working for human causes.

Do humans experience 10,000 times as much joy as non-human animals? Do we suffer 10,000 times as intensely? Are our interests 10,000 times stronger? It is admittedly hard to estimate such things, but I don't think any reasonable estimate would be anywhere near 10,000 times.

For that reason I focus 100% of my giving to the charities recommended by Animal Charity Evaluators. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unfortunately, chickens are not just egg laying machines, and many municipalities have begun having problems with people who buy chickens thinking they are getting a lifetime supply of eggs, but a couple years down the road when the chickens start laying far fewer eggs, these people won't slaughter the chickens, so they just end up getting abandoned. No commercial farm is keeping spent hens for life either, but they inevitably end up getting sent to slaughter. At the same time, if you are buying chickens from a hatchery you are inevitably supporting the killing of many male chicks who are of no use for egg laying purposes. 

If keeping chickens is something you are able to do, look into adopting spent hens as there is a serious need for people to rescue these animals. They are loving companions who deserve and will appreciate your affection, but don't expect to be getting a large number of free eggs out of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hostage taking? We don't want a feral child incident. (This is a reference to the movie [Bold Native](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JToC6l9Xx_c). For those who haven't seen it the film depicts an ALF cell that plans a nationwide string of actions to free animals. At one point in the film the protagonist meets up with an old friend who he had lost touch with, and finds out she had been keeping a factory farmer in her basement, treating him like he treated his animals, and calling him the "Feral Child" while posting videos of it online.)

While I highly recommend the movie Bold Native, I don't think direct action is an effective strategy for achieving the goals we want. In the film the protagonist, Charlie, says, "people will ask themselves 'why are people willing to risk so much to save animals?'" when describing the outcome he hoped to see from his actions. What we really see when these actions take place is people acting like we are the terrorists and simply giving the justification that animal rights activists are crazy as the reason why we fight so hard for the cause.

We need to make the case to people that animal rights matter so that they choose to respect animal rights on their own. Making threats or taking actions against people is not the way to accomplish this. Outreach like what /u/VeganMinecraft is doing, or what groups like Mercy for Animals, Vegan Outreach, and the Humane League regularly participate in is the most effective way to achieve this. </TEXT>

However, there is also the aspect of whether they are animals that can meaningfully be exploited or harmed, as there are some animals such as sponges, that lack nervous systems and therefore there is little reason to suspect they can suffer. Insects do possess nervous systems, and most vegans feel there is sufficient reason to suspect insects can suffer to warrant not consuming them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

<TEXT> You do realize that in order to produce meat you need to feed animals more energy (calories) than you get back out when they are slaughtered, right?

<TEXT> **[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

<TEXT> It varies quite a bit from one veg fest to another. The worst event I have ever been to for pseudoscience nonsense was actually a green festival (I ran the Action For Animals table at the San Francisco and Los Angeles Green Festivals a couple years back). There were magnetic bracelets and "energy" jewelry galore. It was a really disappointing glimpse at the environmental movement that made you realize why some people would question the accuracy of the environmental claims these people were making.

They also printed our name badges on paper made from elephant poop. I feel like they should at least give a heads up before someone hangs some elephant feces around their neck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't patronize us as if we don't have any idea of what happens in the dairy industry. I have been to idyllic dairy farms. I have helped in the process of making cheese with milk from cows that I milked myself. I follow the posts of the [National Dairy Council](http://www.nationaldairycouncil.org/Pages/Home.aspx) and read articles from just about every dairy industry magazine that publishes their material online. Not only do we follow the dairy industry's own publications, but there are vegans who [are former large scale dairy farmers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Lyman).  

I don't just watch undercover investigations posted by animal rights groups. I watch [videos from dairy farmers of their own operations, like this video of farmers "reuniting" their cows with their calves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vSIlTNED-Q). I no longer just see a few happy cows though. I see several panicked mothers who are seeing their children again as well as many more who are still frantically searching for their lost sons. Mothers who may never fully recover from the trauma of losing their children. I read [this comment](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2zwd7f/what_goes_on_in_the_mind_of_a_cow/cpn3ixe) recently from someone else who, like yourself, grew up on a dairy farm, and described the efforts the mothers go through to protect their children. I see the hopeless sons crying for their mothers, but who will most likely face a short life before being slaughtered for veal. I see the slaughter the cows themselves will inevitably face as they age.

We don't make the decision to change our lifestyles lightly, but only after thoroughly researching and understanding both sides of the issue. When you have put half the effort into understanding our position that we have put into understanding yours, then we will be happy to welcome you for an AMA. </TEXT>

There are plenty of comments with views on both sides that have been upvoted and downvoted, and while I'm sure there are plenty of redditors with some bias, for the most part the comments that have succeeded have been due to their merits and speaking to a wide audience. The views I have seen expressed in this thread seem to fall within the normal spectrum of views expressed on animal rights across reddit.

I know that /r/vegan made that stickied post in large part because there are inevitably a handful people like yourself who accuse vegans and specifically /r/vegan of vote brigading whenever comments supporting animal rights get upvoted. If you read the top comment from that /r/vegan post it is about how vegans need to hold themselves to a higher standard than the rest of the community in order to be accepted. /r/vegan wanted to make abundantly clear that it did not support any such actions and protect itself from potential backlash from the community or site admins. I know a lot of the members from /r/vegan and none of them support vote brigading, nor have I seen any pattern of problem vote brigading from /r/vegan in the past (any more than any other subreddit). </TEXT>

<TEXT> If plants did have feelings, far fewer plants would need to be killed if we ate them directly than if we fed plants to animals then subsequently ate those animals, so choosing a plant-based diet would still be a more ethical option. Although, I would argue that choosing a diet particularly heavy in fruit would then be the most ethical choice as plants have evolved to make fruits with the goal of having them be eaten to help spread their seeds. 

However, there is also good reason for us to believe that plants do not feel emotions in any meaningful sense. We know that in ourselves and other animals our experience of emotions exists in the reactions taking place in our nervous system. As plants do not possess nervous systems (and even some animals such as sponges) there is no reason to suspect such capabilities would extend to organisms lacking those systems. 

I have of course read plenty of sensational news stories about how "science proves that plants feel pain." However, all of these stories seem to be based off of much more reasonable research on how plants react to stimuli. A rock will similarly react to the stimuli of being kicked, and a light bulb will react to the stimuli of an electric current, but that does not mean they feel emotions.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As much as people hate to be confronted with criticism of their actions, there are some relevant comparisons to be made. Before people flip the fuck out about "how dare you compare killing animals to the Holocaust or slavery" [read this comic](http://imgur.com/a/BqPzT). I am not saying that they are the same in every regard, nor that they are equally unjust or even that you necessarily have to accept that the comparison tells us anything useful about how we ought to feel about them. I'm saying that in respect to the massive number of deaths or the treatment of individuals as property there is a relevant similarity that can under some circumstances be helpful for understanding both sets of issues. 

While non-human animals may not be deserving of all the ethical consideration of the typical adult human, many of the animals we eat, particularly pigs, are quite intelligent (in many regards more intelligent than young human children). There are many humans (for example the severely mentally handicapped) who will never progress past the intellectual capabilities of a young child, and there is no reason to suspect that they have any more capacity to experience joy or suffering any more intensely than a pig. Nonetheless, we all recognize that it would be a grave injustice to treat these people as we presently treat pigs or other farmed animals. Why should we be any less upset about the terrible treatment of pigs than we would rightly be about similar treatment of severely mentally handicapped individuals? </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's why I added the qualifier "significant amounts of" to my statement. The dairy industry breeds cows to have a calf every year to maximize the total yield, but I understand that cows would still produce some milk for quite some time after having their first calf as long as they continue to be pumped. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Eating meat is natural and doesn't kill the consumer.

OP isn't worried about smokers killing themselves; they are worried about them causing harm to other individuals. Eating meat certainly harms other animals, and it causes a lot more harm than second hand smoke. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the last 100 years we have started doing many things that differ from how humans have evolved. Even in terms of food you are purchasing fruits, vegetables, and countless other varieties of foods that didn't exist a century ago. You are typing away on technology that didn't exist and people are extending their lives with medical treatments that didn't exist. In terms of ethics we are treating women, gays, people of other races, and the disabled differently from how our ancestors would have. Why would you continue to cling to the circumstances under which humans evolved in this one particular area when we have successfully progressed in so many other areas? </TEXT>

<TEXT> In that case I'm sure this will assuage your concerns:

**[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**

 It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

**[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**

 A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.

**[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**

 With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.

**[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**

 A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.

**[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**

 Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.

**[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.

**[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**

 Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians,
these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein
and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who
follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.

**[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**

  A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.

**[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**

 Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Our current treatment of other animals will certainly be seen as barbaric in the future. We are learning more and more that many other animals possess sophisticated inner lives, that they are capable of using tools, learning from and teaching one another, and complex communication. Intelligent animals like pigs undoubtedly experience intense suffering, boredom, and pain as a result of their treatment on contemporary farms.

Just as the past couple centuries has seen our circle of compassion extending to include far greater rights for women and people of differing races, the future will hold greater consideration for the suffering of other species as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First of all, humans are not at the top of the food chain. Animals at the top of the food chain would be ones that eat other predatory animals exclusively. Humans eat plant foods and some herbivorous animals, placing us far lower on the food chain.

If your concern is over the fact that you don't want to be eaten by other predatory animals, clearly the risk of this will not change simply because humans choose to eat more plant-based foods.

The "food chain" should not be the source we use to determine how to live ethically. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you think dairy farms actually keep cows around until they die of old age? Cows' milk production drops off as they age. Every dairy farm sends cows to slaughter.

[From Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle):

Domestic cows can live to 20 years, however those raised for dairy rarely live that long, as the average cow is removed from the dairy herd around age four and marketed for beef.

On top of this cows, like all mammals, only produce significant amounts of milk for a period after they have had a calf (they are inseminated on dairy farms to have about one calf per year according to Wikipedia). The male calves are of no use to the dairy industry, and are typically slaughtered for veal. So the slaughter of cattle is also supported in that sense by dairy consumption. </TEXT>
