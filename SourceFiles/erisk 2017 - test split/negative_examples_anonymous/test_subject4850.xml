<TEXT> Oh man, I remember watching that finale when it appeared.  I still to this day consider it to be one of the absolute best season finales I've ever seen.  It has served as inspiration to me on many levels in what I design.

That said, I was disappointed with how they handled it after.  I was hoping they would really play up the fact that he was this brilliant doctor in a psychiatric hospital more, but then they ended up using it for only a couple of episodes. </TEXT>

So, when I say "cleanup" I mean delete any pointers you've created essentially in this particular case.  So for example, for your array of pointers for npcs you need to free each one that you've created, in order to ensure that they don't keep hogging the memory you gave them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This, so much this. I used to install Firefox to use instead of IE and my family would blame it for slowing down the computer when it wasn't even running (and  had ample hard drive space yes).  If anything went wrong with any tech I was at fault, but they wouldn't listen to my suggestions for things. As an aspiring programmer and maker at the time, it was a major blow to my confidence with tech looking back on it now.

It wasn't until I was halfway through my degrees in computer engineering and computer science at college and had an internship that my parents FINALLY started trusting me around their computers. Now that I have a full time job, they're slowly starting to ask me for advice too. 

TLDR; parents didn't trust me with technology until I got a career in the field even though I'd done fine with it for years. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow, so this is actually something that I would have thought should not happen, but apparently does.  On the one hand, it makes sense.  On the other hand, I don't quite agree with this being handled in this way.

So, here is what is going on: You are deleting your enemies upon creation.  Because they are created as objects (IE: Not referenced objects via pointers), as soon as they are created, they are destroyed, because they are no longer in scope.  You need to make your array an array of pointers instead of an array of just objects.  (IE: enemy npcs[10]; needs to be made into enemy* npcs[10];).  Then, you can create each enemy using new, and call the destructor for each one with delete.

Honestly, I too am a bit surprised this is happening, and maybe it's a compiler thing as it seems wrong, but maybe I'm mistaken.

TLDR; Your objects are out of scope because your arrays is an array of objects, not pointers, so game::npcs[game::total] = enemy(x, y, 1); will result in their deletion immediately. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just a quick look through the code, it looks like you may be moving the sprite off screen too quickly in void game::update() (you move every npc by 0.0002,0.0002 each iteration through, but there is no delaying this).  I would try removing that first and see if that fixes it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, sorry about the delay!

So, the problem in your code is that you *technically* are deleting your enemy's texture.

When you create your enemy it its constructor (enemy::enemy(int x, int y, int type)), you create a local texture variable (sf::Texture texture;).  Notice that this is not a pointer to a texture, but is a new texture object in that constructor.  When your constructor exists however, it gets rid of all local variables created within there.  In this case, because you created a new object, and not a pointer to an object, it will delete your texture when exiting the enemy constructor, thus creating the white square problem.  Remember, any time a method finishes, it cleans up everything.

*Technically* pointers also get destroyed, but what they reference does not!  Hence, a quick solution to fix this is to change your texture to a pointer (sf::Texture* texture;) and create it using the new keyword.  Make sure however that you keep that reference so you can delete it later, otherwise you will end up never deleting the texture object that is referenced, and will end up with a nice memory leak.

I hope I've worded everything clearly, but if not, feel free to keep asking questions :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure!

Honestly, I feel like overall it's had an incredibly positive impact.  Obviously because I'm doing the stream to make games, I've made a ton of games during this time, but there's also been a huge awareness to the quality of what I make as well that's occurred.  Now when I make a game, I find myself a bit less worried about the quality for my private code, but more worried when I publish things (which I think is good, though I suppose that's debatable).

The other big thing that's been helpful is that it's forced me to learn proper terminology, something I've pushed off a ton during my school years.  That is to say, making sure that when I am talking about references vs pointers, I am able to give a more technical definition, as well as a general explanation.  I'm still working on this personally, but it's a lot better than when I started.

Finally, I've learned about a lot of new tools for my videos, as I didn't want to spend a whole lot of time with setup and such.  Thus I've learned a lot more about other engines, in order to simplify my development.  As an example: I recently learned a lot about Three.js as another potential series.  So when I went to work one week and needed to use it, I was able to use it there, without needing to do a whole lot of extra research on what I wanted to do.

And obviously of course I've learned some new things about C++ and SFML along the way :)

TL;DR: My code quality awareness has gone up, my use of proper terminology has gotten better, and I've learned a ton of new APIs thanks to this stream. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-03-29 21:31:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Recently I had someone request I make a Twitch stream on doing game development in C++.  I stuck with C++ and SFML, and went through and showed how to make several types of 2D games (pong clone, space invaders clone, a top-down RPG, and more).  While it's some rushed code (so as not to drag out each episode too much), it might be a decent resource to those who are interested.

You can find the entire season on my Youtube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOFi3QmBRyyMnw0PHVM7smZh9Iw8a8WA7

I'm working on some new content for my Youtube account (game dev and programming related), as well as planning out a second season for my Twitch stuff (and focusing on increasing the quality of what I put online).  The big thing that I'm going to make better for the next season is having things a bit more prepared beforehand, as well as making sure the last episodes aren't me just sitting around rambling as much.

Any feedback on this is welcome of course.  I hope people find this useful!

<TEXT> Okay, so this is based on the original idea I had when I made this (sorry, been running around all day so only just got to typing this haha):

-So the start of the video would be them dancing around in circles.
-Once the drums start, the start swinging in and out before fusing to Garnet.
-Lyrics go with Garnet dancing around
-Some kind of faster paced animation while singing goes
-Once "Go ahead and hit me if you're able" is sung, they split again and dance around, maybe introduce Jasper into the video and have the three of them fighting.
-Right before the first "We will always be twice the Gem that you are" they fuse back together, dancing around with Jasper at that point.
-Once the solo part starts, they split apart again, dancing around.
-Lyrics start again and they fuse together.

This is what I have for right now.  Feedback and such would be awesome :)

I've tried to add some personality to the current animation (it won't be the same every time), and was originally planning to have the animations change based on the beat, but still have an amount of random to look cool haha </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I started deving for DK1 using the hardware my school had one semester. When I tried to continue the project over the summer without access to the hardware, I found there was nothing like what you mentioned. If this has changed now (which it seems it has as of December 2014) then obviously that's good, but as a product that will just be starting out, it's important to do that from the beginning. </TEXT>

I'm currently working on my first big game on the PS Vita (Keeping it private until I have something pretty to show... which is looking like it'l lbe in the next two weeks or so!)  I also do miscellaneous dev stuff, like helping with some 3DS homebrew stuff, running a C++ game development Twitch Stream, game jams (when time permits), and more.  Working to use Twitter more so recently, though I just want to Tweet about stuff that matters, cause I don't think people would find my ever day thoughts as fun lol That said, once my game is public, expect lot's of Tweets as I work on development more :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> After the most recent, my moto360 started having great battery life.  Then, randomly this past weekend, it's life shot way down.  It only lasts for a max of 5 hours now.  Has anyone had this issue?  No settings have changed, and even untethering it from my phone kills it in the same amount of time.

Edit: After sending it back to Motorola and getting a new one, the issue has been resolved.  If you experience battery issues like this with a moto360, it might be worth calling support as this seems to be a hardware issue with the batteries where it can't hold a charge long enough essentially. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hadn't seen any simple C++ libraries for the Oculus Rift other than the normal SDK, which seemed a bit overly complicated, so a friend and I made one for our senior project.  It also includes support for the Microsoft Kinect, and I'll be adding support for the recent updates to the Rift SDK soon.  I've also got a new Kinect 2.0 that I plan to add as well.

<TEXT> Hello Gabe, Wolpaw, EJ, Ido, and Coomer!  Glad to have you guys here!

I was wondering if you had any tips for wannabe game developers who only have coding experience.  While I can code a game fairly well, I don't know many people who can do the artwork, nor do I know many people who can do the music/sounds, and while I want to get into the industry, it's been a long struggle.  What tips would you have for either meeting people who can do so, or finding ways around it (preferably under a college-student budget)?

On another note, any internships available at Valve, and if so, could I have one? XD </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys, a quick compo idea I posted a few days ago.  If this is not the right subreddit please just let me know (not on here too often still), otherwise enjoy!

The name of this minicompo is The Github Name Game.  When you create a repository on Github, it generates a random project name as a suggestion.  The idea with this is to create an entire project based around whatever name you get (for example: I got duck-batman XD).  If you're interested, post the entry on my blog post below.  I'll try to keep an eye on this thread (or elsewhere if it get's moved).  No prizes or anything for this as of yet, but even if there are none, it's still a good resume booster I'd say!
