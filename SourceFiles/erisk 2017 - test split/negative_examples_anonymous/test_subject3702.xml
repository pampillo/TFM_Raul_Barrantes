<TITLE> account in collections, not on credit report </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have medical bills from last year that amount to roughly $1000 dollars. I was an idiot, and let them get into collections. 

The same collection agency is dealing with three different amounts, and I received the letters about four months ago. 

I'm now cleaning my credit up, and ran TransUnion and Equifax credit reports, which are not reporting the accounts at all.

**Question:**

I would like to pay up to half of this right now, and pay the rest off in installments. Should I call up the collections agency and just do it, or should I try to receive some sort of writing first that it won't be reported on my credit report?

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The author is changing the license of the code, however, so soon, it will be.

He can re-release the code under a new license, but it doesn't change the fact that the old repo was forked and modified with the old license.

~~Ir~~regardless, he does have some pirated ROMs on his site, so the morality of this guy is questionable.

ok, fair. But the roms are being distributed to demonstrate the functionality of the emulator, not being claimed as the authors original work. He shouldn't have them up there, but using possesion of GBA roms as a metric for morality may be a bit too sensitive when dealing with an emulator.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Was it vital for the survival of human beings? If not, I'd rather we be in the dark for certain subjects... 

The problem with that line of reasoning is that the nature of knowledge and information doesn't work linearly. Knowing something new about one thing can open up breakthroughs in unrelated fields. 

It's unfortunate, but if we abstained from everything we didn't need we'd be living extremely spartan lifestyles. Cheap clothes, cheap food, cheap energy all come at the expense of unsavory consequences.  </TEXT>

Step 1:

use input type='file' multiple to get the users files into the browser

Step 2:

send these files to the server

Step 3:

on the server, use a library like ffmpeg via php, to convert and echo said files.

Step 4:

When the server sends the response, make the file available for the user to download.

That should help get you going </TEXT>

<TEXT> Apply to many, many places for a barbacking position. Use friends, friends of friends, family and acquaintances as references and potential leads.

In that position, you'll be working with bartenders. You will be a bitch, doing menial tasks and learning what happens behind a bar. Work hard. Take every shift offered to you. Cover shifts. Be prepared to take criticism. Learn the drinks and the side work of the bar.

 In time, you'll start blurring the lines between barback and bartender. Then you'll be able to pick up -- here and there -- bartending shifts. Using that experience, you'll either A) be able to weasel your way into a bartending shift at the place you're at or B) start applying with actual bartending experience to other bars.

Good luck man. </TEXT>

They got the TBS deal. It's not hard to imagine, given TBS' s track record for realising potential. J   A have an excellent portfolio. The Twitter campaign was planned to garner support, awareness and viewers for the upcoming show. 

They split with college humor because they might be a) already shooting episodes,  or b) because of conflict of interest / a very busy schedule of writing and shooting the upcoming show.

<TEXT> An honest question:

It's awesome that facebook would pay for and appreciates this kind of exploit reporting... but is what he did technically illegal? 

I know somebody from highschool who found major exploits in the school's network, documented  and then reported them to IT to try to get a job for his senior year.

The IT department head (It was made up of like two/three people) responded by reporting him to the police and he ended up beibg expelled. I'm not really sure what happened to him legally,  but I know it kind of fucked his life up for a bit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of course what I **feel** doesn't change the actual law, I'm not trying to say that.

I'm simply pointing out how unenforceable the law is for anybody that's not trucking thousands of stolen milk crates off to a recycling facility.

I could have [one of these](http://www.amazon.com/Buddeez-MC01016BLK-Crates-16-Quart-2-Pack/dp/B00I9VP9NU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1423098979 sr=8-1 keywords=milk+crate) strapped to my bike, or I could have [one of these](http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/mgnjv8-b781049432z.120130114213840000g4k1bvr1d.2.jpg) with, say, the warning worn completely off.

Further, there simply aren't enough resources to prosecute every offender with a stray milk crate laying about. 

Facts are facts, I'm not arguing that. 

I have however, spent the last hour researching the question, reading police forums and news articles and subreddits etc... I can't find one case where an officer has been willing to cite a person carrying a milk crate around, even with the warning label on it, without having first seen the person physically pick the crate off of some property. 

I did see one kid who claimed to have found two milk crates on the side of a dumpster, pick them up and started walking home. The police stopped him, asked him where he got them, he explained and they took them, or something.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  But we take out them, for example, we spent over $4.33 million last year on milk crates. And we can no longer just ignore that and absorb the cost. We have to go out and attempt to reclaim our crates.

And how the fuck does he intend to reasonably do that? By throwing college kids in jail? I have a milk crate that I inherited from a roommate years ago. It's so old and sun bleached that no lettering can be made out. I still use it to this day. 

If I got pulled over on a routine traffic stop while moving and had that in my car, it seems ludicrous to me that that is a potential felony.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> pickling is pretty damn easy, start small and if you end up going nuts over pickles you can work your way up.

Off the top of my head: a stock pot, couple of measuring utensils, food grade mason jars, a knife etc... Pickling spices and food to pickle. 

Basic pickling procedure is to a) make a brine and b) ferment your vegetables in the brine.

Cleanliness is a must as fermentation can be conducive to mold etc if you don't clean everything with soap and hot hot hot water.

With this basic knowledge, I would suggest buying a pickling cookbook. I don't have a suggestion for you, and I would imagine that any one would do for you to start out with.

My personal favorite is pickled beets. I fucking love them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't have a tablet, and I have an affinity for reading from paper.

I just printed out two articles to read because I'm super tired and sick of staring at my computer screen and just want to lay on my couch and read for a minute.

However, the print outs look awful. Search bars, comment boxes and submit buttons are all present. Navigation, archives and article contents are all stacked and have standard looking blue underlined hyperlink styles. All of this combined takes up two - three pages.

I know it's super simple to do, but I just realized that of all the websties I've made / contributed to in the past year, I don't think one of them describes even basic print styles. 

Any opinions? Am I the only person under 40 who prints stuff from the internet? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your Honor, this case is clear cut. 

The charges are as follows: 

1 charge of GRANDTHEFT.JPG
1 charge of Karma Whoring

The prosecutions defense is thus:

he definitely stole the picture above and tried to claim it as his own. The title is a dead giveaway. And I quote "Some soulless mother fucker put this sticker on the wall next to me at TPA Airport".

Yet, I see no admission of guilt and no direct claim of ownership.

After all, the burden of proof falls on the prosecutor to show **beyond all reasonable doubt** that the defendant has committed a crime. 

And in no good conscience can we say that this defendent, beyond reasonable doubt, has made a claim that this picture is his own. 

By the prosecutions line of reasoning, defendant /u/metalligod666 could have been in the very airport where this picture was taken. Knowing of the existence of the picture as has been posted on popular forums and subreddits, found it and reposted to reddit.

My client is guilty of the misdemeanor of reposting a picture to reddit. And if we were to attend to each and every one of these offenses, the courts would be bogged down for years.

I move that the charges of grandtheft.jpg be dropped as there is no definitive proof that my client has claimed the picture as his own.

We'll be willing to settle for one (1) charge of karma whoring, which entails a stern warming and nothing further. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've had destiny for two weeks now. Playing up to 20 was awesome. And then grabbing gear to get to 22 was fun. Now I'm level 24, and I'm a bit confused as to what else to do. I've basically been running tiger strikes for the past two days, and doing some bounties. But once bounties are up it's either strikes or patrol, which get prettyy boring.

So is that it? Grind and grind to get the gear to do nightfall and vog?

Any suggestions? I kind of suck at pvp.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure if it's an influx of new people to this sub or what. I've noticed a couple of these mildly dismissive, sometimes snarky responses popping up in the past few weeks.

Granted, I'm not a huge fan of "WHAT IS THIS? CAN I EAT THIS?" posts. But I'm also not a fan of "Don't ask if you don't know!" types of responses.

This is legit one of the few subreddits that keeps me coming back to reddit. I really like the community here. 

I feel like answering someone's ID request in such a way is unfriendly, and a cop out. Even if you can't make out / do not have the skill to make a complete identification, the least you can do is say something along the lines of:

*looks like what you've got there is a [boletus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boletus). Take more / better pictures and do a spore print for better help on identification. Also remember that it's highly suggested that you be 100% sure of you edible identification before you eat it.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree with /u/Pewpewonme, I do not think your job is easy. 

But FOH falls within the realm of hospitality. BOH is artisinal in nature. 

And sorry to say, but you don't really *make* anything. You contribute to the atmosphere of a restaurant. 

As far as that goes, there are college majors in hospitality. It would be silly to write anything exclusively on "serving" or "waiting tables". Why? Be nice, smile, always check back on your tables two minutes after they get their food etc...

The things that make your job difficult are stress and memory, and things that contribute to your success are largely people skills. There could be other things, especially in super fine dining, as specific knowledge of wines / beers / ingredients.

All of the above is a part of hospitality. So you could start there...

<TEXT> haha I don't know. 

Apparently blue-rare falls between 115 - 125 f. At that temperature, it's basically raw with a sear.

I've personally never experienced anyone who requested anything lower than that. Though, there was one regular who would order his steak 'pitsburg style.' And the specific way he'd like it was for us to  "throw it in the coals for a few seconds and then give it to me. " So there's that.

Also consider that 115 f is  45 degrees over room temperature. Anything under might resist a proper sear... who knows?! hopefully someone else. The steak would probably look something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsF1G1sGr-g) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, first and foremost: seek therapy.

Seriously, you feel as though it's harming you. Get professional help.

But since that's not always an option for everybody...


What are you insecure about? Your looks, actions etc... After you isolate what you are insecure about, start taking proactive steps towards adjusting your mindset. 

I think it's important to realize that you aren't going to wave a wand and all of your insecurities will evaporate. It's normal to be insecure in certain situations, that's just part of being an ape with a crazy imagination. You're also not going to feel better immediately. 

Changing your outlook is an organic process, you need to gain the experience while growing. You could spend 48 hours reading about how to play a guitar, and not be able to play it at all. You could spend 48 straight hours practicing guitar, and still suck. But if instead you spent 48 days playing guitar 1 hour a day, you are likely to have better knowledge and skill at the guitar.  

It sounds corny, but it's just down to hard work. Don't allow yourself to ruminate, try not to sweat the small stuff. 

It's all I can give you </TEXT>

And the sad part is that a large portion of people are going to fall for this bullshit. 

It's incredible, the older I get the more political theater begins to resemble vaudeville.

Where are you at 65-80k? 40k is a livable wage, depending on where you're living. Boston, New York, San Fran, yeahh? Portland, fucking absolutely. Chicago, sure.

It also depends on you're quality of live? Let's assume 50k is dead of the line middle class. What exactly are you doing with that slightly upper middle class margin? 

And more importantly, why do you feel that you need tha slightly upper middle wage to be considered earning a livable wage? Owning a house, having kids etc?

Some people don't see those as qualities required for thier standard of living.

Louis C.K. has a bit related to this, only he's talking about people who hit thier kids and others that encourage hitting kids.

Which obviously you aren't saying.

First, I doubt he believes that his children literally need Nickelodeon. He probably means that if he's going to pay for it, might as well pay for something to keep the kids entertained as well.

But even on top of that, what exactly are you implying? That, above the basic necessities they get a whole pile of jack shit? It just seems like an insane way to run a family unit, and a poor attitude to pass on.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> why? because then you know he likes women? 

Seriously, I don't understand... I know that it sounds like I'm intentionally being dickish. But if you go over your friends house to play video games and you see a model in underwear on his desktop you get... uncomfortable? Like as in, you don't know what to say? Or you feel bad/sad/something? inadequate? 

I mean, I don't subscribe to displaying sexy women on my walls and or desktop. But strictly speaking, I don't subscribe to putting anything on my desktop, and think it's a sin for you to have anything more than a solid color. And the color better not be too crazy.

But I digress, I could understand awkwardness if you went over to a friends house and he had -- as his desktop background -- Stoya taking a big fat cock up her ass. Even more so if it were a perfectly looped gif.

But aside from being a straight male and liking women, I also think that there is an aesthetic wonderfulness of a women's body (not to say that the male figure is unpleasing). 

What if your friend had a small paper weight replica of something like [this](http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/images/h2/h2_52.11.5.jpg), or perhaps [this](http://www.decodingtheheavens.com/blog/image.axd?picture=2010%2F6%2F399px-Obese_woman-Louvre-CA968bis_mg_7494.jpg). Would that still be awkward?

<TEXT> This comment actually scares the shit out of me, because a lot of people think like this. 

You just equivocated spanking with evil violence, and the use of which on your own child as cowardly and completely indefensible.


Now let's just define some terms. 

The act of spanking involves tapping someone on the bottom and applying light to medium force. The force should not be so hard as to leave a bruise, swelling or extended redness.

Now, I would define evil violence as something along the lines of something heinous and radically counter intuitive to human life. 

Examples of committing acts of the above nature are -- tragically -- happening in the in the world today. Subjugation, genocide, torture, war ans so on.


So, if you don't like spanking don't use spanking. If you want to evangelize your anti-spanking stance, please  by all means do. 

BUT if you want people to take you seriously, don't imply spanking is like committing genocide.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> So my question is along the lines of this:

When we say, "species x is impossible to domesticate!" Do we mean to say something along the lines of, "species x is completely impractical and too hard to domesticate!"

I wonder because it seems absurd to say that it would be impossible to mold something into something else from a generational standpoint. 

Admittedly, I don't know enough about it to talk intelligently. But I think that plants would be at least slightly analogous to animals as far as domestication is concerned. Animals being more complex would present more variables and therefore take longer. 

But I would imagine that it took more than a few generations of humans to produce the domesticated plants that we have today. 

So why wouldn't we be able to have a domesticated zebra in 120 years time? If somebody (edit: multiple sombodies, at least) *reallly* wanted to do it, I would bet my money that they could do it.

Just sayin. Humans are pretty awesome, we fly through the air in metal birds and talk to millions of people with a series of tubes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends on what server side language you are running. You could be running something with PHP, Node, Ruby on Rails, Python or many others. 

It seems like you want to use Ruby on Rails. Do you have the environment set up? 

Take a look at [the getting started docs](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) for some general guidance.

Then, **the very basic** strategy is to 

* send the JSON data to the server
* take JSON data server side and update database
* send response from server with whatever updated information you would like to send back

<TITLE> A question about junior devs, and breaking into the field. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-21 00:58:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Two things first:


http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/2b2u38/ive_just_noticed_a_pretty_big_security_flaw_with/


Rundown:


/u/smokedoutraider discovers that namecheap sends GET data with usernames and passwords in plain text. 

"HOLY FUCKING SHIT, that's incredible," is what everyone should be thinking. Inside the thread several people defend this as Namecheap's Community Manager says that they're working on it. 

The phrase "junior dev" is tossed around as an argument against incompetence and in favor of somebody just not knowing any better.


**THEN**, earlier 


http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/2b1u4h/2_hours_ago_we_came_up_with_an_idea_for_a_new_app/


Here, I don't even know. Some guys getting drunk at a pub think it's a great idea to make an app to tell them what clothes to wear instead of the temperature and current state of the precipitation outside.

This thread was negatively received. I personally think along these lines: "making things is (almost) always better than not making anything." But I understand a lot of the grief in the thread. Still, their website was very amateur and the developers seemed naively enthusiastic.



**Alright,**


Where do I apply to get into a junior position?


I have been freelancing on and off for over three years. I have a day job that doesn't involve writing code or making websites. I'm now at the point where I split my time as 30 hours/wk day-job, 30+ hours/wk freelancing. I have some stuff up on github, hang around stackoverflow occasionally, try to contribute to open source projects when I can...

But I don't have a college degree. And then I read that it's acceptable in some people's minds that a junior dev can send GET data containing plaintext passwords, or that a "group of developers" believe they can get people to do the ground work of their UX design for free.


The few job listings for front-end devs I see scare me away. Every time I work up the nerve to start looking, I get half-way through the requirements and become discouraged. 

"Strong Computer Science Background and/or five years experience in the field." Seriously, what junior dev has that? I went to school for Comp Sci and more than half of the students that did graduate didn't have a "Strong Computer Science Background."

I think that I would have something to add to a company and would really like to start working with/learning from people in the same field.

**In short,**

Developers currently working in the field, what advice would you have for someone looking to get their foot in the door? What would you expect/look for in a junior developer? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> About a year ago I cracked a molar on the right lower side. 

Recently, it's been a bit intense when eating / drink cold stuff. 

I just looked at it in my mirror with a little led pen light and noticed that there's a decent sized black dot where I would imagine the root begins... It's not completely black like some of the horror show images I've been looking at.

But I have been feeling on and off sick for the past week and a half: headache, nasally, one side of throat a tad sore and just run down.

I don't have any insurance, so is this something that needs immediate attention? Like don't go to work today? Or can I call on monday (because that's when the clinic hours are)? 

Sorry, I know this post sounds naive, I just wanted some outside opinions before I go running somewhere with wads of money that I don't really have. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hmm, now that's interesting. Don't you think that we would just make a leap of interpretation and say something like 

"geo- of or relating to the earth." where "earth" is to be interpreted as soil, rock etc. 

That way it would be understood that the geology of the martian surface would be the study of the planet's composition. 


Although awesome, it seems a bit silly to have to have a specified name for every object that existed outside of the earth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I need money like you wouldn't believe.  So in debt, owe a friend who I barely knew at the time (still not as much as I'd like) a ton of money... but the moment my employer pulled some guilt trip on me like this...I'd be looking for a new job.

Hey, I don't want to come across as a dick or anything. But my biggest fear in life is being unemployed and broke. The second biggest is  drowning in debt. 

I would much rather eat a little shit from an employer than be in either of those positions.

**EDIT** 

Reading through these comments, it seems to me that a lot of people here are not familiar with what it is like to be solely responsible for your living situation. It's possible that this is due to the younger user base of reddit, but who knows. I'm by no means 'old', but I am truly on my own. I live thousands of miles away from **any** of my family and live in a major metropolitan city.

Look, it's like this:

I have a certain standard for my quality of life. I want to have a place to live, food to eat and to be able to enjoy myself from time to time. Even if you have $5,000 to $10,000 in savings -- which is still not a lot of money -- six months of unemployment begins to get very dire. 

Rent, phone bill, laundry, electricity, transportation, internet, clothes and food are all expenses. Sure not all of of them are essentials, but as you start cutting them out you become less competitive and more withdrawn. This is just a fact of the modern world.

And yes, you can turn your back on almost all of these things and still be alive. But being a gutterpunk, crustpunk, homeless person is simply not something that I want to do. 


Yeah, I get it. I'm "part of the problem" blah blah blah. How many of you pointing this out would be willing to put yourself into a dire situation to prove/fight a flaw in the system? 

There is no magic escape plan for a lot of people, where "uh oh I can't pay my rent this month" turns into "okay you have 1 month the get the fuck out of my apartment complex." 

So yeah, I actively let the man beat me down at times. I'm not saying it's right or just. I just want my apartment, my phone, food, internet electricity and to be able to go out for drinks on the weekend. Sorry guys! </TEXT>

<TEXT>  A person who must rely on public transportation is viewed as unreliable and a possible liability by most companies.

I don't see how this would be a problem in many cities. 

Trains often run faster during high traffic volume and when there isn't time to take a train or bus just hop in a cab. 

I can't imagine being discriminated against in NYC, Boston, or Chicago for relying on public transit. 

If you're living outside of a city, or in a smaller city surrounded by the suburbs... Well, of course you need a vehicle. But Major cities? A lot of times it makes sense to just take public transportation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> How old are you? If you're in high school, take a drama class and/or get involved with after school drama. If your school doesn't offer anything like that, look around for community theaters. Usually (but not always) these put on very low-stress productions and will get you used to being on stage.

If you're past high school age, then your best bet is probably to do the same with the community theater or to find out what's going on in a nearby university / college. 

It wouldn't hurt to take some acting classes, you'll meet people who have the same interests and it's a great way to learn the craft and network to find different opportunities. 

You could also skim craigslist for people putting on small-time film projects as well. Usually these will be extra-type roles.

Networking and knowing people will be your best friend. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While I agree with your sentiment, I think that what people get upset about is that it presumably takes much more devotion and mastery to get a phD then it takes to become a waffle house line cook.

I'd propose that:

1 - education is important for society and
 
2 - people are required for providing that education.

I am not surprised that certain people feel entitled to higher wages. I am less surprised that someone who has worked 7+ years at mastering a specific craft feel especially entitled to higher wages. 

Sure, you know some people that are doing fine. But there are many many many adjunct professors making 25k/year. And that simply isn't enough money. 

So, yeah, I think people should be slightly outraged and entitled. Basically, I fucking love eating at waffle house, and I think that maybe adjunct faculty would like eating there too. Unfortunately, some can't because they decided that instead of flipping waffles all day, it would be a good thing to teach some people some cool things and probably learn some new stuff in the process.

WHY DON'T YOU WANT PROFESSORS TO EAT AT THE WAFFLE HOUSE?! </TEXT>

I had four people in my small graduating class join the military.  One junior year and three senior year. 

At that point, we still had to raise our hands to go to the bathroom.

That's not to say that when I was 17-22 I wasn't a complete idiot.

But to treat young adults as though they are still children -- I think -- is a complete mistake. 

I am currently 25. I'm now what's considered to be "an adult." I know that that is still relatively young.  What surprises me most is how much I have to learn but how much I should have spent considering myself capable of making life changing decisions.

just bought a new ASUS laptop running 64-bit Windows 8.

The problem is, I cannot connect to anything via ssh ftp sftp etc...

I've tried connecting to a few different servers using putty, winscp and fireftp all with the same result: "Network Error: Connection Timed Out"

I can't even connect to one of the websites I manage via the cpanel ui for the same reasons. 

I've ruled out router or ISP problems, as I can do all of these things on both my phone and old computer on the same ntwork.

I have also tried disabling Windows Firewall completely, but still get the same network error.

<TEXT> You know what? I call bullshit. Or at least gross over exaggeration. Or I am misunderstanding the full time college part.

168 hours in a week. You average 75 hours of work and 40 hours of school.

We're left with 53 hours for the week. 

You need 35 of those to sleep (5 hours/night). I suppose that you could crunch this down by going with some alternative sleep cycle, but I'm going to assume that if you work around 75 hours a week, you're schedule doesn't allow for it.

So now we have 18 hours left for the week. I figure, hey, you live decently close to school and work. Assuming that you have a day where you do not physically have to be at either of these places, you do not remain sedentary, we'll average a 15 minute one-way transit time. And that you are in transit for approximately 1 hour every day (to and from, to and from).

What remains is around 1 and a half hours of unscheduled time left in your day. Let's say the math is fuzzy and that you have 3 hours of unscheduled time. You need to do laundry, pay bills, eat, clean your house, buy groceries, get dressed, bathe etc. 

If that were you, you wouldn't be on reddit right now. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Is it worth a life? What about if it was your stuff? Your computer? Your car? Would you kill someone who was taking your entire life savings if you knew it was the only way of recovering it?

A computer is not equal to a car, but are very much similar compared to your entire life savings. 

None of which the young man was likely to be running away with.

But either way, the reason why none of this should be happening in the first place is that we operate under a justice system.

What's actually absurd is the fact that people go through such lengths to defend murder by means of vigilante justice. Because, no matter what position you take in terms of whether or not the store owner had the proper motivations, the store owner committed a murder. 

Even more, the store owner murdered a young man for what was presumably petty theft. So not only did the he murder someone, but his arbitrary punishment far outweighed the crime.

And further still, I seriously do not understand why people really want to reserve the right to shoot at fleeing burglars. One would think that it was a) bad to kill another human without the absolute necessity, and b) that absolute necessity requires extreme duress or life threatening danger.

So, no. It is in my mind never ok to blow someone's head off with a shotgun because they were taking property from you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's how it is:

Are you ready to be a chef?

Absolutely fucking not.... but

Are you ready to be a line cook?

Fuck yeah dude! You will find your place depending on your current skill, general kitchen intelligence and aptitude for getting crushed on the line. If you are not confident in these last two qualities, you'll most likely find your self on the fry station. 

But don't fret! Thats good. If you work hard and are diligent about cleaning, putting out good plates and have a good attitude, you will find yourself getting more shifts and the opportunity to move to other stations. You'll also get an excellent idea of how that kitchen works, who the main guys are and any of the sous and actual chefs quirks.

Work there for *at least* a year, preferably two if you think its a good fit. If you absolutely hate working the oine after a year/year and a half. Theres your answer, no, chef career crossed off. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have experienced sleep paralysis for most of my life. When I first started to experience it, there were no visuals, just the inability to move. 

Now every once and a while when I get it, I open my eyes and see what looks like spiders crawling out of corners in the walls. It is slightly alarming, but I quickly realize what is happening. I've found that it's actually a great way to drift off and get into a lucid dream... I just kind of "succumb" to the paralysis, and just be aware that I'm dreaming. 

I've also had the feeling of shaking on the bed, like what's characterized in those "possession" type of horror movies. Which, needless to say, was *very* alarming the first time. </TEXT>

What are your guys opinions? I'm an east coast transplant and am silly and ignorant about the pacific ocean in general... Is it going to be too chilly to sit around on a beach towards the end of February?

<TEXT> A quick question for you:

I have several decent projects on github, and have been contributing to a handful of open source projects for a little while now.
I have been rigorously focusing on my javascript developing skills, and really want to get a job in the field. 

I've recently become comfortable enough with my skills to start looking, but EVERYTHING seems to require a higher education degree... is it even worth applying to these jobs? Or is it likely that my resume will get thrown into the rejection pile?

How should I address that issue? </TEXT>

It seems like a pretty menial thing, but I've been in that situation before... Not being able to identify with you're coworkers other than "hey, he's just some guy," can make work life miserable.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sorry, but 20 hours a day is absurd. How many days a week are you working 20 hours a day? if you were to work two back to back 20-hour shifts, there would be four hours of down time between forty hours of work. assuming that you slept for all  of those hours, you'd still only be sleeping for four hours in a night. There is no possible way you could be doing this for more than three days at a time, unless you are some kind of savant. 

and three days at a time would be pushing it.

Edit:
I don't want to sound like an asshole or anything... It's just, a 20-hour work day is something very unheard of, and I'm just assuming is hyperbole. I could be wrong though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The quest is to get to work on time. You consider yourself a veteran. You've been through the worst of the bumper to bumper traffic. You have averted many crashes. You know to check the traffic report *before* you get on the highway. You have a stash of whatever the fuck you need to get through a long goddamn commute. It's been a long time on this road... 

and then one day, some teen/mother/father/asshat, driving far too recklessly decides to switch lanes too early, or to read the most recent text message, or look for a cigarette lighter, pet his fucking cat is too distracted and fucking slams right the fuck into you.

best case scenario, you're late for work. worst, you have some debilitating injury. even worst is some kind of life changing can't walk talk in broken syllables kind of thing, but even worst is that you could fucking die.  

at whatever end, someone like you could argue: well, techinically, they **were** the better driver. But who the fuck cares at that point. You're still late for work/have brain damage/ are dead.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a cook, I will absolutely cook your food however you want it. But if you order a $25/30 steak well done, I will think less of whoever is behind that ticket.

It's not so much because you have tastes that are different than my own, but more of a combination of proper technique and also straight logic. 

Because let's be honest, if you're going to order that steak well done, just get a hamburger, no bun with some onions and mushrooms on top. Load it up with A1 and enjoy. 

But also because to me in my esoteric ways, ordering a steak over medium (and even medium is pushing it), is like ordering sushi quality yellowfin tuna cooked entirely through. The tuna is "supposed" to be served seared and black and blue. And arguably that's why you're eating the tuna in the first place. Otherwise, you are eating something prepared incorrectly and probably would enjoy something else more.

<TEXT> You can't redefine veganism to fit or support your own lifestyle choices.

Vegan/vegetarian is an ethical stance.

Yes, yes it is.

Veganism (/vignzm/) is simply an extreme form of vegetarianism which eliminates any and all animal products from the diet. It can also refer to.the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products in every manner possible

oh, and more specifically,

One of the main differences between vegan and vegetarian diets is that vegan diets exclude both eggs and dairy products...

It sounds like you might be a vegetarian. </TEXT>

It's a bold statement to make. It has been made about many things that we now revere. I don't want to get into an argument about it or anything, it's just a nice sentiment about being human... You are making a universal claim, and it holds true right now. I mean, it really does for the most part.

<TEXT> an honest question:

Why do you want to pay for something that should be learned through hard work on your behalf? There are many free -- not in the sense of dumbed down articles and tutorials -- resources on the web and in books (not actually free). 

The reason I ask is because I'm just assuming that you do not trust the reputation of free information, but realize that I could be wrong.

Seriously though, if you're looking for a way to learn web design my best advice would be to not pay for it with money! Work on building a portfolio of work that you have invested your hard work and time, which in the end is much more valuable. No paid courses are necessarily going to get you there faster. Just tinker, receive criticism, and tinker more.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Now this is one of the really tough questions. The reason is because "the greater good" is really loosely defined. It could mean simply "the greatest amount of people unharmed", it could be used to imply some sort of "universalize goodness," or perhaps other more specific definitions for deciphering the greatest good, beliefs of what that is, and what is actually happening in reality.

There is no real answer, of course. Unless you believe in some sort of system of truth that exists independently of the world. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No. Due to certain quantum factors, there is a 50/50 chance that the toast will land face down on either side that is buttered. 

In order for toast to levitate, you need to refrain from buttering either side. Because of the same quantum factors as above, there is an inverse property which causes the chances of it landing face down to become -50%, or in other words, floating. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wasn't trying to argue with him. I was just pointing out that his remarks sounded like something a child would say.

But I have an honest question for you. How old are you? Please don't think I'm looking to make an ageist argument here, I'm just curious. I'm 25, and have been out of college for a little while now. And the one thing I regret is not spending more time focused on studies. I honestly think that I was too immature to start my studies in the first place. And I guess my point is this,

College helped me grow up. It allowed me to become independent, get lots of new interests, learn romantic relationships, make big mistakes (and recover from them), etc.

I think it's very important to acquire this kind of culture, and it's almost tragic that collage/university study has become the medium for which most kids in the US go about getting them.

Being truly self sufficient and supporting yourself financially is when these lessons really happen. College should be about improving upon whatever skill set you desire to improve on, so that you are more prepared when real life happens.

<TEXT> not being able to keep a steady job, or maintain a healthy relationship because you have to drink. Drinking so much that it could potentially kill you if you stopped. 

I drink, but I've also seen how alcohol ruins lives. 

Cigarettes will give you a heart attack at 55 maybe, or put a hole in your throat, or fill your lungs up with delicious tar etc etc... But booze can turn a person into a shade of what they were.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was a little shy in high school, but I had a couple of girlfriends and wasn't afraid to socialize, fell into a few cliques etc... I'm not sure if many high schools are like this in the country, but I grew up in an extremely controlled environment. We were not allowed to leave the building for any reason whatsoever with out a proper escort (usually the hall monitor, or school police officer), and were to be under constant supervision between school operating times. For after school activities, an adult was to be present at all times.

Now, I know that these precautions were taken for legality issues, but my point is that we were treated like children in an unhealthy way. I also know that under the eyes of the law most of us were still legally children. But the negative aspect of this type of coddling led to discouraging a lot of the kids there from doing important things early on.

Okay, so now to my point. When I got into college I still felt like a kid. I did well in school, I did well in life (mostly) but I had no fucking idea that I could actually **DO** things. I spent so much time in the later parts of high school feeling like anything I tried to accomplish wouldn't be taken seriously because I was still a child, and feeling discouraged because I thought that anything I tried to do independently would be perceived as childish, that I ended up doing nothing at all. I only realized that I had an ability to accomplish things greater than assignments and orders from older people when I was almost finished with college. And this, I feel, put me at a serious disadvantage. I realized later in life than some that the most important aspect of accomplishment is taking initiative. I was too happy going to school, having friends and getting drunk because it was what I was "supposed to be doing." 

**TLDR: I regret not realizing that I could take life by the balls in high school** </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh! I doubt I'm going to give you any ammo for "abuse" really. I didn't really consider at the time that you may have been joking, and was trying to point out that the statement is idiotic because what the original poster said had nothing to do with linking the evolutionary fertility of rabbits to gas powered lawn mowers. 

Simply that rabbits have to be so fertile because they so often choose poor locations for their nests. The guy was offering consolation, in that for some little bunnies that get mowed to pieces, hundreds more are getting eaten by various predators cause momma rabbits can't get their shit straight. So there will be more of these little fuckers running around in no time, which is great to think about when you just accidentally chopped a bunch of them up. He was offering consolation, not applying for a grant to study the evolutionary traits of rabbit breeding. 

And that, good sir, is why you were an idiot for posting that remark. But hey, you got the karma for it... so it looks like I'm the one with egg on my face.  </TEXT>

It's similar to Eisenhower wanting the world to see what the nazis had done in the concentration camps. Not only desensitized people went to view the atrocities, many people went for different reasons. And we still learn about them today as a reminder of the fucked up things that have happened in history in order to potentially prevent them from happening again.

<TEXT> okay, here's one:

I grew up in a small small town in Massachusetts and the house that my family was living in at the time had a lot  of forest behind it. I wish I could tell you how much acreage-wise, but up until I was probably 17 I used walk through the woods back there and I never hit the small road that was on the other side.

So, one of my favorite things to do was go out during January/February after a couple of good snows had fallen. All the brambles and undergrowth had died out and you could follow animal tracks forever. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a good at tracking animals or anything, it was just fun to see what animals were running around out there. I was always looking for Bobcat tracks... but anyway, I digress.

I was probably 15 at the time, I had just gotten out of school and it was this time of year and not too cold. I started out, and chose to go a way out that I had been in the summer, but it had gotten too think to move any further. So I'm walking. and walking. for probably 45mins or so, perhaps a bit longer. I stopped for a moment to get my bearings, realizing that I'd never come this far in this direction. I look around a bit, and then take few more steps forward. And then slowly, I start to hear this music. Not complex at all, it sounded like a pipe or flute. The melody was very simple, five notes total, repeating in two phrases. I was scared... mostly because encountering anybody this far out in the woods could go bad. 

So I stood there. The music just kept going, steady and not relenting. I was too afraid to go anywhere closer, but I still just wanted to listen, to see if anything happened. Finally, after about fifteen minutes of listening, my fear got the best of me and I went home. 

I was pretty upset with my self the second I got home, so I decided that the next day after school I'd go back, retrace my steps and go see what was going on. I did, and there was absolutely nothing. No footprints in the snow, no houses, nothing. Just fresh powder underneath a pine grove. 

That is the weirdest thing that's happened in my life by far. I always went back to that place to try and figure out if there was any little cabins or homeless shacks in the area. Never found anything... kind of spooky.

TLDR, I heard some weird music in the middle of the woods.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> you know, I agree with this. But before everyone starts to shit on me, I'd just like to explain.

All feelings are valid, in that they are phenomenally there. But some feelings/responses can be misguided. For example,

"When you go out with your friends without me, I feel like you are avoiding me and that makes me think you don't value our relationship. It would make my life better if you took me out with your friends ALL THE TIME."

now of course this is an unhealthy statement. I'm not arguing that it's not. But these are legitimate feelings that are completely off base. (Specifically I know this, because it happened to me once upon a time.)

<TEXT> It's strange, because I feel that you're the one trying to muddy the issue. I suppose it would be foolish to take this argument any further, because I can only see now that we will not reach a middle ground. 

just one thing:
it's about the fact that pornography is not a healthy basis for understanding sexuality from a biological angle and I think that 8 years old is to young to be taught about sexuality from an instructional angle.

You are upset, from what I've gathered, that he knew the distance between the holes. This seems strictly anatomical. But also remember that one hundred and fifty years ago, pinup girls would have been seen as hardcore porn, and a child seeing a girl's ankle would have been unhealthy. 

I'm not trying to muddy the issue, I'm trying to withdraw my feelings from a controversial subject in order to find some truth. It would appear that you cannot help but inject your feelings into it and conceal them as fact. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I mean, I honestly don't *feel* so good about it. But I'm not sure if there is really any inherent reason for this to be wrong.

For example, I would have no qualms about a 16 year old bringing an 8 year old to an art museum where there were nudes on display (painted, or otherwise). The line between what we deem as "smut" and tastefully done -- is in my mind -- nonexistent. 

Furthermore, and why I asked if you had a specific argument, is simply the question of how diegojones4 felt about the whole thing at the time. It seems like he was alright with it. And if that were the case, then quiet literally no one was harmed here.

 Is it that you feel sad because you had an innocence at that age that you would like to hold on to, and therefore it bothers you that someone else did not have that same innocence? If that's the case, then, yes spell it out. There's no reason to go on making moral arguments based on silly little feels.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As long as there were rules in place to prevent a pissing contest between candidate and fact-checker. It would have to be heavily moderated and have a clear format.

I would watch either way, really. The sad thing is that even with experts fact-checking in real time, people would still cling to partisan feelings and thus the debate would be spun based off of those inclinations. I have a feeling very little would be accomplished, it would just be a longer and more educational debate. But when it came down to it, people would hear what they wanted to hear and the experts would matter very little.

Actually, it would probably just prove to be a big shit show for the experts. Their careers would probably be under such scrutiny after trying to prove Mitt Romney or Barack Obama wrong that after the first one, no one would step up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> False. I am talking about that word being used as a general pejorative.

Your argument is based on the idea that this word is no longer a homophobic slur. That is patently false.

you contradict yourself to make a point, and then you mention honesty about the meaning of the word. I don't know what this honesty is meant to refer to, a literal definition of the word or its connotations? 
The use of faggot as a pejorative is an augmentation of its once literal definition anyway. And emotional reactions to the word have everything to do it. If the word Faggot didn't inspire negative emotions in people then we wouldn't be having this conversation to begin with. 

and a correction: I know the word still can be used as a homophobic slur, that's not my argument. I'm saying that it is also taking on a new meaning, one that denotes -- as you said -- a general pejorative. Not a specific homophobic slur. 

EDIT: and for these reasons, you're argument is tautological. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The use of homophobic slurs is homophobic.

The argument: that this use of the word in a certain context is in fact not homophobic.

Your argument assumes the correctness of "faggot" always being used as a homophobic slur. It even goes so far as to imply that if **both** user and target have reached an agreement previously to not treat "faggot" as homophobic, but instead as part of their vocabulary of playful denigration, it still is a homophobic slur. 

If this were the case, all words would remain static. This is clearly not so. Also, I think it's pretty clear that a community such as reddit is by nature very opposed to homophobia. This establishes a sort of redefinition of what it means to use words previously defined as homophobic slurs. 

AND, one more thing. Words are words and only people give them power to hurt. If you treat "faggot" with such seriousness, it only deems the word necessary when spouting vitriol. Much like the word nigger has been used. The best thing to do is use the word with utter farce, lampoon it's own hateful meaning.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, I'm sorry. 

But the people on here telling you to confront your mother and threaten to tell your father can go fuck themselves. Well, perhaps not that. But I think it is the wrong way to approach the situation. This is based off of the principle that this is none of your business. Just be an adult and talk to her. Keep it between you and her. Get her perspective. It is most likely the case that there is some dynamic between your father and mother that is completely unknown to you. Affairs happen, this is just part of real life. Don't go bulldozing through your family just because you're too offended that your mother wants a proper dicking from some other guy.

I understand this comes across as harsh. Hopefully it isn't taken as malicious. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Again, wrong.

Modern philosophy is *not* applied psychology. What you may be referring to is Naturalized Philosophy, which is a specific branch of philosophy. And even then, it's not so much applied psychology as it is applied "let's accept some empirical facts about the world"

Modern science is by definition a conglomeration of facts based off of a philosophical framework. Much like Aristotelian physics and the geocentric model, the standard model and quantum physics. 

Not all philosophy is speculative, in the same way that some fields of scientific research *are* speculative. 

I'm not here to make value judgements. There is no "better than the other." But I'm also going to give philosophy it's credit where credit is due. A lot of people forget the history that Philosophy and Science have together. They used to be in love, you know. </TEXT>

Not too long ago, Science was a proper branch of philosophy. 
Also, logic and analytic philosophy. These are found at the foundations of the scientific method and formally part of the philosophical tradition.

In other words, philosophy embodies almost all fields of study. Even mathematics.  </TEXT>

This might sound like a load of bullshit. But it's either that, or live in the turmoil of knowing you don't have some stuff you made in highschool. Im not into the visual arts myself, but I have two really really good friends (one painter, one illustrator) that are both out of college. And they are both terribly embarrassed of what they did in highschool. Not in an ashamed way, just a "oh wow, I've improved so much" kind of thing.

<TEXT> let me tell you why this is bullshit:
There's no way the farmer can completely sustain himself. 
Let's assume he's using simple tools (hoe, axe, rake etc..) He either needs to greatly increase his work time, or greatly increase his manpower for maintenance on the farm.
If he is doing this by himself, he very little time to do anything else (harvest the crops, store them, sleep, eat, be human). 
If he has extra workers, what compensation do they receive? Let's assume there is no money, and that they are paid in the crops that are grown. Then that means more food has to be grown for each new worker we introduce. Even if none of these people had family members that didn't work on the farm this would be a challenging task.

On top of that, and I know it sounds silly, but where did he get his house, his hat, his clothes, and (in the picture) his little grill? Let's ignore the grill. How did he build his house? He doesn't have time for that he's too busy using hand tools to grow enough food for the year. Did he pay for it with crops?
Ah, so now we have some people that build houses and some people that grow vegetables. When one wants to eat, they *trade* skills for food, and vice-versa when the other needs shelter.
This extends outward, and gets increasingly complex. Which is why we have money in the first place, because in order to maintain any basic standard of living (even the most conservative) it is next to impossible to do anything without trade. And if we're trading crops for houses, we might as well have this universal medium so we can get things from people that don't want houses or crops without going through a long list of trading to get something else; say, honey, toilet paper, cars, pencils, straw hats or little tiny grills.
