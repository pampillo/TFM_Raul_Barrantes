<TEXT> Maokai mid, good burst with his combo and his saplings are a 100% ap ratio if you hit with both parts of it, and if you go against karthus your passive will be up a lot.
Cho'gath is another good mid because i believe rupture is also 100% ap, and feast is good burst when part of q w combo. </TEXT>

<TEXT> How is that a counter? Once you have an achievement you always have it. So if you are trying to not die one game, you can just get the cs achievement next game. You don't get all the achievements in one game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Idk about ranked, but AD sion is just insane. The way I play him, I just farm for the first 30-40 minutes, and hope my team doesn't feed too much. Bring cleanse and ghost and just jump in a random team fight and try to win the game. Time spent farming can vary, but the health bonus is very much needed. Also I never go back unless I get killed, I will even ulti to stay in lane if I need to. The way I see it, if you have no kill by midgame they don't build to counter you unless they notice your 400 cs, if they don't counter your build or stop you from farming, you will end up 2 hitting a ziggs, or ulting your team back to full health. </TEXT>

<TEXT> How to play sion: ignore everything your team says and farm solo top for the first 30-40 minutes of the game, then show up late to a team fight use your ultimate to heal all of your teammates, get the ace, then push to win and kill anything that gets in your way. This guide only works if your team doesn't feed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree Kat is not UP, I play her most of the time, and do good a lot with her, and almost always win my lane. If she gets fed early, she is very hard to stop unless you have hard CC, but even then if she is built she can be a problem for the other team. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a good idea. I am lvl 30 with 500 something wins(not saying that is good). I have only played 3 ranked games, and I was invited to those games not knowing it was ranked(duo queue). I'm not saying you should be able to make your own avatars but if they did add it in, they should maybe have ranked games be a part of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fiora? Underpowered? I think she can do massive damage and has a pretty low cooldown counter ability. I mean sure you can build armor to make her do less damage (as you can with other melee carries) but I would never call her underpowered. She doesn't need a nerf though, imo. </TEXT>
