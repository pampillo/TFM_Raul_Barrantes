<TEXT> I played St. Andrews in west chicago the day before and shot an 88. Shot a 103 on Dubsdread...  but it was also 91 degree with 80% humidity and cart path only.  My drives were all off, and I flubbed 6 pitches or chips into the sand. 

I want to play again in a few months when it's not so hot.  

On a Friday afternoon the pace was great.  4 hour round.  I've heard the weekends drag to 5+, which is unacceptable as far as I care. 

The fairways were great, the rough was really long, and the greens were lightning quick. 

Is it worth it? All things considered, I'd day yes, on occasion.  </TEXT>

But I was trying to argue against the guy who's post I was replying too.   

That yes, many blacks do have a poor attitude and appear not to work, and that I have experience that can back that up. 

But then I also said that I blame the "black culture" that has been developed due to oppression and poor education. 

It's your white guilt (I'm assuming) that is making you think I am racist. 

I don't work near poor white trailer parks, but if I did, I'm guessing that the hiring pool would be rather crappy there too.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As someone who has been responsible for interviewing and hiring recommendations, I can attests to this.  Out of 20 people interviewed for a factory job (basic assembly using hand tools, paying $11 to start), 5 will be black, 5 white, 10 latin, 5 other.  9 out of 10 of the blacks don't show up on time or at all, and then are greatly unqualified (mostly poor attitude).  I blame the "black culture" somewhat, but mostly the education system.   We've let down entire generations which is the cause of this "black culture".

That being said, I knew a kid who's mom pimped him out to men, and I've heard of some other fucked up shit, and that's wrong.

But lucky for your friend, his first flaw is really easy to see...

He's swinging with only his arms.  There was no hip or even shoulder rotation. He needs to form a triangle between his arms and shoulders and maintain that through the swing.  The swing should be with shoulder and hips, the arms just go along for the ride.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A turbo set up would of added a grand to the sticker price.  Hell, my ST was the same price as the base model.  If they wanted to make that car fast, they could of.  Instead they made it look fast and spent their money on marketing.

But hey, if you like having a small fasy looking car that isn't fast at all, then good for you!   Just don't cry when I blow your doors off.   And God help you when I start to put upgrades into it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reminds me of something Stephen King wrote in the beginning or end of one of the Dark Tower books...

Some old lady wrote him, telling him how she was dying of cancer and wanted to know how the books would end, and she swore she wouldn't tell anyone.  It broke his heart to know he couldn't tell her, because at the time, he had no idea how it would end.   George R.R. says he has an idea on how it will end, but I wouldn't be surprised if he's just saying that to keep us from completely losing our collective shit, or if it doesn't change on him in the process of writing it. 

And the best part is, we'll get to see/know, if he finishes, because he's told D D how he thinks it will end.  So we get to compare, one day, maybe, hopefully... </TEXT>

But, I think the key to everyone's game is: Spend time on the range!  LOTS OF TIME.

<TEXT> Similar but different...  There was a guy who was a hole behind us, but he was hitting out of our fairway, buy the green, only 150 yards away.  He was just standing there waiting for his fairway to clear or something, but he was holding us up, which was holding the guys behind us up, which was holding up his fairway...  5 minutes of us standing there yelling atamd signaling the guy, I finally hit into him (over and onto the green), and as we drive up he starts taking shit.  Closest I've ever come to kicking the shit out of someone on the course. 

When we pulled up he was like "what the fuck dude?!".  I was actually  polite at first and told him that he was in a group behind us and in our fairway, and to keep the pace of play, should of let us hit first.  His reply was "Fuck you", which is when I lost my cool and said "fuck me?! No, FUCK YOU!  Say one word and you'll catch an ass wooping, and I'll catch a case!"   Which is when he picked up his ball and walked away muttering something. 

So,  I know what it's like to lose my cool.  But when ever people hit into me, i just pick up their ball, show it to them, and throw it into the woods, water, or off into the rough.  </TEXT>

I mostly focused on keeping my short game good and I shot in the upper 110's then slowly into the 90's. This winter I took some golftec lessons and focused on my irons, and in now shooting in the mid 80's to low 90's.  I want to jump into another set of lessons with my driver, but I don't want to push it too soon. But you're right, until I can find the fairway (or stay out of trouble) from the tee, I'll never be close to going as low as I want.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reading this just made me so angry.  I hate "parents" like that.  I've found the best solution is to say something the very first time the child does something inappropriate.  And I don't say it to the kid, I turn to the parent and firmly say "do you mind controlling your child?  This action/ behavior is not allowed here for safety/insurance/privacy/corporate policy."  If they say shit or let it continue I call a manager over.  When I was a manager, this is what I trained people to say, and if I got called over, I informed them that if said behavior was not corrected, that they could take their business someplace else.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Correct sequence is where the lag comes from.  From the top, the swing should start with the feet, then legs, then hips, then shoulder, then arms, then last being the hands and club.  This is "lag", and is probably the hardest thing in golf to get right. 

Since the golf swing starts with the hands and arms in the backswing, it's hard for us amateurs to not start the downswing with the hands and arms too.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is the most correct answer.  The giant club face helps, but also hurts, same as the long shaft.  Mistakes get compounded and amplified.   It's also part mental.  

You should try taking what feels like half a swing and a slower speed.  Just try to deliver the club face back square to the target. </TEXT>

He was a super clean freak, showered, shaved,  brushed his teeth and everything, but his teeth were bad and getting worse, he was always breaking out in sores, and he eventually blew his brains out.  The shit some pharmaceutical company makes in a lab is NOTHING like street meth.  Nothing. If you think it is, then go back to doing meth, and check in with me in 10 years, if you can.

<TEXT> Police don't just show up and start harassing people.  Something had to draw their attention to said person. If that person then was polite, respectful, and didn't question authority and act like they know the law/their rights, then unless you are breaking the law, the cop will go away.   I've always been polite and respectful, and i always walk away.  My friends tend to mouth off and make sudden movements, and end up in jail. 

Is it right?  Fuck no.  Fuck the police, their agenda, and their corporate masters.  But, i like my "freedom", so when i see a cop, i do my best to be John Q. Public Taxpayer,  and i suggest you do the same.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What about the traffic jam that people cause by stopping in the road, as opposed to pulling off? Example, on a normal four lane street (two going each way), a person stopping in the street blocks off one lane and backs traffic up for miles (sometimes during rush hour).  Why don't people driver up another 100 yards to a parking lot or side street? </TEXT>

<TEXT> If I was in this situation, I would go to his house, talk to his parents, find out when he will be home and give him one chance to make with the photos.  Digital copies before I went anywhere/let him out of my sight.  I would not directly threaten physical violence, but he would be able to tell from the look on my face that his well being currently in jeopardy.
