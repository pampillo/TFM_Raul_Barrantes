The only dick I've sucked is my own, so I can't say with certainty if it feels like sucking someone else's D. I can, however, say without a doubt that it does *not* feel like being sucked by someone else. What it does feel like, however, is shame. *100% pure shame.* </TEXT>

Edit: /u/kickme444 responded to me, but I anticipate m'lady will be heavily euphoric so here's the reply  
It was hard to communicate my dank memes, because my comments were being downboated. I did comment on (le)reddit lmayyyyo and was tipping my trilby on a private subreddit. I'm euphoric now." </TEXT>

<TITLE> How does the human body correct an imbalance if it is too acidic or too alkaline? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-30 00:06:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Someone recently told me about how an alkaline diet can help prevent cancer. I'm far from being a dietician or a scientist, so my understanding of the subject isn't that great; however, I did a cursory Google search and it provided a lot of information to quickly debunk the whole alkaline diet as a means of cancer prevention. Anyway, I guess what I'm looking for is an explanation as to how the body becomes too acidic or alkaline through diet in the first place, and how it corrects the problem. Also, what are the implications, if any, of having an overly acidic or alkaline body. Are there any cases of people having a disorder where the body is unable to correct an imbalance?  
  
Thanks in advance, guys and gals! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Came to this sub by accident because I hit the "random" button, saw this post, and was really saddened by your situation. I don't usually give advice, but here goes.
  
Be yourself, OP. Don't try to be someone else by mimicking what you think is "normal" behaviour. Do your best to fit in if that's what you feel will make you happy, but don't feel like you have to put on an act for others for them to like you; you'll never be happy as long as you're acting your way through life. I don't have Asperger's Syndrome, but I know others that do have it, and I never once expected them to "act normal." It's a disability that people should understand and respect. Your family should be giving you the support you need, not acting like there's something wrong with you.  
  
Have you met with a counsellor? If your family have been as unsupportive as your post suggests, perhaps you should find one have have your immediate family members meet with them too.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I spent years having to listen to ignorant, racist assholes tell stupid fucking jokes like this at work. Thankfully, I'm no longer working in an environment like that. I'm glad you lost your job, because if you're saying shit like this at work then you need to learn a fucking lesson.

Edit: A lot of the replies to this comment are absolutely abhorrent. I'm not sure if they're jokes or meant to be serious. Regardless, it's very disheartening to see so much racism in this thread. I know it's the Internet, but I expected more from reddit. I genuinely hope that despite whatever hateful things your parents taught you, you break the circle of ignorance by not passing down your racist attitudes to your children. They deserve better. The world deserves better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cows are the most land and water intensive livestock to raise. That's why people in many countries eat less beef and tend to eat more pork, goat, and other smaller farm animals that can be kept in smaller spaces. Also, people in other countries tend to eat a lot less of everything than the average North American. </TEXT>

Look, dude, all I did was make an inane comment on a silly post on reddit. It's what I do on this site. I don't take it seriously like you do. Judging from your commenting history, you're nothing but a loser neckbeard who sits around on his computer all day. If you want to feel smart, get out of your house and make something of your life instead of trying to pick fights on the internet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> On closer inspection (now that I'm on a computer and not my phone) I can say I'm almost certain that is not a fallstreak hole. What you have there looks like a small gap in a layer of stratocumulus cloud, which is actually pretty common. It could be because of the way the cloud is forming or dissipating, or it could just be that the clouds are moving in such a way as to form a gap. Fallstreak holes usually only occur in mid to high level convective clouds, such as altocumulus and cirrocumulus. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I liked having a tall locker. The smaller ones were hard to get into if the dude below you was fucking around in theirs. I once had a small locker (a bottom one), and the person who had the locker above mine left a sandwich in theirs throughout the Christmas break. The smell of rotten salami and mayonnaise made its way into my locker and stayed there for the rest of the year. The few articles of clothing I left behind over the break smelled, my gym shoes smelled (and not like my sweaty feet), and worst of all my text books smelled. I had to throw out everything except the text books, because I couldn't just replace those --they were way too expensive. I used those text books for the rest of the year, even though they stunk up every classroom they entered.  
  
TL;DR - don't rent a small locker. </TEXT>
