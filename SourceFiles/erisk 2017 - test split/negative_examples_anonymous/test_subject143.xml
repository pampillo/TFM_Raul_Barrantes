<DATE> 2015-06-16 18:24:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys, so a couple months ago my girlfriend was diagnosed with depression and it's been really hard for her she moved away from her family to the uk to study and has not made any friends since september, she still does have alot of friends back home but she doesn't call them much.

Basically what i posted this for was how i can help her, i live about 3 hours away from her and i was staying with her since she was diagnosed but recently i've had to go back home for certain reasons and she's having a really tough time she's telling me she's so lonely, i call her but she's so quiet and won't talk, i miss her so much i feel terrible being away from her, i can't visit her due to money problems atm and i want to be able to support her and help her get through this while being away, i love her so much and i'm so lost i hate seeing her like this so what things can i do to help her through this tough time while i'm away i'll do anything to make her feel better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know exactly what the problem I have been the exact same way with my girlfriend and one point, the problem for me was just one day I started lasting less and less and it really damaged my confidence, I didn't really want to have sex as I know it would end in disappointment for her and I got no enjoyment out of cumming anymore as it just made me feel guilty, after that if my girlfriend started to tease me or try to kiss me with tongue I'd try to tone it down and make it less sexual as I was scared that it would lead to sex which would lead to disappointment again, I didn't want that feeling so I didn't want sex.

I don't have the answer to this problem but I don't think you should listen to the guys here saying "He's lost interest" that's exactly what my girlfriend thought about me, ASK HIM ABOUT IT! Only he can tell you for sure it helps to not make him feel pressured into having sex be patient and talk to him.

Feel free to send me a message if you wanna talk about anything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally I love the name but I don't think they will change the name because they may have already used the name in the dialog of the story if the braham picking up eir's longbow idea comes true, they would have to get the voice actors back in and change it and that cost money and time which I'm sure a net don't want to spare right now with working on the expansion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel a good solution to this would to be to force New PvP players rank 1-3 perhaps to all play in the same games and not give them an option for hotjoin, unranked and ranked until reaching rank 3, maybe forcing them is a bit much and instead create a seperate queue for only ranks 1-3, this could give people some much needed practice against people who are also new to PvP and eliminates any higher ranked and skilled players from dominating and scaring away the new players. </TEXT>

The firing range and shield/sword training, i mean they can help with reaction times, they could even make the trainer for sword training a giant golem that puts up a bubble shield so it wouldn't look silly with a few people doing it at the same time, it's relevant to pvp at least. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You've hit the nail on the head here i guess what it is that i'm most scared of was like you said the guy being better at this than i am, i feel like i would take that the wrong way and knock my confidence, it's not an easy decision to make, losing all control and allowing this to happen.

The part you explained about stepping back has really gave me a new perspective on how to look at it, thinking of it that way i don't get as angry as i would normally, i guess i picture myself in the point of view of the other guy and that's not the best thing to do.

I do need to work on my own insecurities and overthinking the situation and i think i can do it, you've helped me out more than you realise but i know i'm not going to change over night, but at least i have a new perspective to think about, thank you. </TEXT>

But what if even after my experience i still feel too jealous, i would feel absolutely horrible denying her the experience that i had, and i'm sure she would be upset if i did that after her allowing me to have a threesome with two girls. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like this system could be easily abused, what if there was multiple scouts on one map by multiple i mean like 30, what if some player just likes making random markers at places for no actual reason, it is a tough issue to solve.

I was thinking something like the commander tag, but for scouts, the tag allows their text in map chat to show up in a different colour to the others, a scout tag, it would also allow people to see which towers have scouts, due to it showing up on the map much like the commander tag, not sure of the pricing of this tag tho, maybe 100g like the old commander tag? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Are there any engineering courses that are more practical based rather than mathematic based? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-27 16:49:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Basically i'm in a foundation year of an engineering course at the moment and i'm really, really struggling with all the maths and i'm dying to do some practical work and actually learn something, all this maths just seems like it's a waste of time and leading to nowhere, i feel like i'm probably going to fail this course, but the thing is i really enjoy the idea of engineering, fixing things particularly, is there a course out there that judges you based on practicals rather than maths tests?

I've thought about apprenticeships and gaining experience through work but i have no idea where to start, i'm young and have never had a job, but i really want this to work also i'm in the UK so if you can point me in the right direction on where to start looking that would be fantastic, i just feel all a bit lost at the moment.

Thank you in advance. </TEXT>
