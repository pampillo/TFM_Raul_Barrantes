<TEXT> * If you're into drug store stuff...Definitely Herbal Essences 'naked' shampoo and conditioner. 


* If you use salon stuff, bedhead was always my favorite...S factor smooth/shine products would be perfect from the sounds...All bedhead stuff smells delicious enough to eat as well! 


* Andddd, hair gets tangled easier the longer it is...Maybe try to keep it up when exposed to wind etc. That might help a bit as well </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not the first show to keep the awful parts, I'm not saying its a good thing but shows have been way worse about the exact same issue...And if it was all rainbows and butterflies in these people's lives it wouldn't be worth watching...And the male characters have struggles too...One of the male characters is a closeted homosexual and they show realistic issues about that too...It's not like writers are out to get women. It's not every 3 minutes and in some of the cultures depicted in the show its a really relevant issue...Such as in Korea where Sun the business woman is located...And in the second episode she kicks major ass and continues to in the entire season and even prevails over the assumptions made about her because she is a woman in Korea


Honestly the female characters in this show end up being the most important characters in it. But again, if you want to judge it on the first episode and completely condemn it because its realistic in a way you don't like then by all means.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The thing is though...if you think about it the show is realistic in this sense...Women in the world do struggle with that kind of thing, how is it lazy writing to show those issues and then show the very same characters thriving and empowered...I think if you didn't judge the show so harshly in the first episode and gave it a real chance you wouldn't feel this way.


I get that feminism is important and as a woman especially but its a show and its a show that's realistic to how the world is. Especially when it comes to trans women. The issues its depicting here are actually why we need feminism and its not really encouraging the behaviours its depicting...But obviously you're a logical person and you get that...

For example Dexter is about a serial killer but its not telling people they should go out and do that but it gives a realistic depiction of that scenario in most cases... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reasonably priced, so probably under 20 to 30... I am currently using all drug store brands except my brow pencil is laura mercier...I'd prefer not to pay $58 for one thing...

<TEXT> Okay, so can someone that is good at make up help me pick out brushes, and good quality make up... I still don't want to go full on glam but right now I'm a noob that only knows how to do brows and basic things like eye shadow. 


Also advice on contouring would be appreciated as well but subtle is best







Edit: my eyes are hazel, my skin tone is pale/milky white, my hair is a light copper color, my brows are light like my hair, and my price range is reasonable...I can't afford to pay $200 to have a a starting amount of make up...
And I do actually have a bit like brow pencil, blush, white shadow, mascara, and one foundation brush...I have foundation but it needs work...I do like to combine liquid(bb cream) and powder foundations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you so much for replying, I will definitely treat myself beforehand...Tuesday is coming so fast I can't believe it.

I've arranged for my boyfriend to look after me afterwards so I'm pretty fortunate to know I won't have to do too much with a week off...But, it was still a worry for sure...

Its good to hear the drugging happens quickly, I'm going to be a ball of nerves at the hospital. But, I definitely realize that you're right...My pain is too bad to prolong this and getting a diagnosis is worth it.

I'm so glad to have gotten supportive and encouraging feedback, it means so much to me.  </TEXT>

Its even better to hear good things about the Mirena because I'm supposed to be getting one and I already picked it up and that was another source of anxiety for me. 

I'm very thankful that you commented on my post, thank you so so much. It means a lot to hear so much insight. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As someone who recently discovered their own bisexuality I'd say its most likely him learning about himself...Its more about discovery and exploring himself and his sexuality...I wouldn't worry that he isn't watching straight porn...

In fact I've found porn to cause trouble in relationships no matter what kind it is...

I'd definitely say that him being bi isn't going to make him cheat on you, it just means that he is attracted to people regardless of gender. He's still the exact same man you've always been with...

May I recommend you head over to r/bisexual for more advice if you  want more opinions of people who have good perspective on this. 

Also, its rather intrusive to go through his history...That's private and I'm sure you wouldn't appreciate it either...Being bisexual isn't a reason to distrust someone </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually have a bi friend and talked about her before it was even a thing for me and it didn't go very well..

My mom said it was probably just a phase and that she would figure that out after high school...That right now she is just being selfish so that she has more people to date. That she hates when people say they're bi...Like can't they just pick one or the other...Its greedy and they're just trying to be promiscuous and trendy. Because it is more accepted people think they are when they're really not.

My dad is quietly judgmental. But, I think he would ultimately accept me for who I am...Its honestly mostly my mom.

<TEXT> I've only told my boyfriend and my two best friends and I'm really really not sure how to tell the rest of the world yet so I thought I'd start with reddit.

I'm 20 and female I've only started openly identifying this year, by this I mean identifying as bi at all...

I'm mostly scared of what people will think, I was raised in a family that had the belief that gay and straight is okay but bi is wrong and greedy and slutty...So, obviously I still worry about what my family, friends, and strangers will say when I tell them. 

Also, still dealing with how I myself feel about it because of this too...

Just wondering how you all coped with coming out and the consequences of it...with friends, boyfriends, girlfriends, family, etc. </TEXT>

It shouldn't be used regularly and is actually really hard on your hair.

<TEXT> The lather from shampoo actually isn't a good measure of anything as its all chemically created...I use dread shampoo and the lather is very very minimal and consistent because it doesn't contain these chemicals...Even Sulfate free shampoos typically have other chemicals in them...

My hair acts much better and the natural oils in my hair are not stripped from washing daily. Because I use natural oil based dread shampoo, which comes in a bar like soap..It doesn't strip any oil. Its all about what you're using.

<TEXT> Actually I was wondering if it is the best way to measure my fat to weight ratio and what range I fall under. It is not about feeling better about myself emptily. I am still exercising and trying to lose the weight and I intend to continue with it. No matter what response I got I intended to keep exercising. I honestly just want to know the best way to calculate this sort of thing so that I can measure my progress...Because there's really no physical difference yet as far as muscle etc.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My BMI is 23.4, which is on the higher side of normal weights based on the calculator I used...Now, I'm 5'1...124 lbs...and I'm a 19 year old female...Is this a normal weight for my height and age? I've been made to feel like its not by most BMI calculators etc. I also gained a lot of weight in the past year...I started community college last year and gained 20 lbs. I used to be 110, so I've lost about 6 lbs since I gained weight. I think this might be why I'm so worried about my weight but I'm interested in getting opinions as mine may be biased. Any advice is appreciated.  </TEXT>

I haven't managed to do it but I'm thinking synthetic dreads would be a good alternative for me because I'm a Caucasian girl with thin/straight hair too. I'm wondering a few things about getting them...Such as how long should my existing hair be in order to put them in? And where should I typically go to get them put in? I've called a few places that offer extensions but no one there knows anything about putting in synthetic dreads...I know a few people that can dread actual hair would they have an easy time putting in syn ones?  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-07-17 18:40:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My shower was going normally...and then I had the bright idea to try and shave in a stand up shower. This may sound risky in itself but I've done it before so I thought I was a certified pro at it. So, the arm pits happen without a hitch but then I start on more risky territory. As I'm finishing up  I'm realizing the quality of my razor isn't totally on the up and up. I only paid $6 for 3 so I should've known. But, here we are. I have a partially shaved butt and a bleeding finger. And to top it all off band-aids don't stick to anything wet, so I ended up getting blood all over my towel trying to get out of the shower. The worst part is it all happened at my boyfriend's house. 

*As a side note, my finger took the brunt of the damage from the razor because the damn thing was so flimsy and cheaply put together the replaceable head comes off without any warning.  </TEXT>
