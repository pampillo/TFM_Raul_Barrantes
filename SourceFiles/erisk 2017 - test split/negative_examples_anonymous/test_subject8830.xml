<TEXT> No worries! The more people that play this game the better. It's one of those you can keep coming back to and replaying.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Enslaved odyssey to the west is an amazing single player game. It's quite overlooked but it's one of those games that just draws you in. It's based on a really old Chinese story Journey to the west and its adaptation is brilliant. It has really colourful scenery. It plays like a 3D platformer with some puzzles and stuff. Really recommend it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> seriously, the "group amnesia" that happens in the first disk bothers me so much. just comes off as lazy writing

I completely agree. And then when Irvine admits he recognised everyone when the realisation comes at the orphanage, it's just like WTF why didn't you say anything on disk one. Its like the writing team changed after the first disk.

<TEXT> Yeah in 8 it started off well but the whole thing in space was just cringe worthy. At least in 9 it was certainly portrayed better. More of a classic tail... tale </TEXT>

<TEXT> I always wished they did a standalone version or even redid it now and released it as a phone game. I might have to play it later now...

<TEXT> Yeah that's the same with me. Always was a close runner between them all but it's just something about 9 that's gives it the edge </TEXT>

<TEXT> Blitzball is hands down the best mini game in a Final Fantasy. Second the entire Gold Saucer from 7. If you ever get a chance to play 9 I do highly recommend it. It's quite different from all the others </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would have to say Final Fantasy 9. I am a big rpg fan and I remember playing it so much when I was younger. I've completed it several times. I would say the others ones from the sort of time (7, 8 and 10) are some of my favourite but for me nothing beats 9. The world, the characters who never seem to take themselves quite seriously and the little glimpse of what's to come when you see Garnets edilons when you first control her! 
Ahh the brilliant memories of playing tetra master... </TEXT>

<TEXT> First ever post and I have completed the survey! Good luck hope it goes well. It's certainly a well discussed subject with lots of strong opinions. It's just a cycle which repeats itself every time a new form of media emerges!  </TEXT>
