<TEXT> It requires even more intelligence to listen to solid advice, both legal and financial. 

For example, someone told him that's his best argument is to not have liquid assets and later testify about it, say that everything is a show. It takes strong will and intelligence to fight the ego - especially in that industry - and actually follow on that advice. </TEXT>

But the score is hidden. It's like saying my heart is hidden. I just don't know what to feel and how strong.

That's actually a bad thing. Not that you should flip your position just for the sake of it, but there's also a natural progress in human behavior, and I hope that when I'll be in my 50's I'll still be open to see that's going in the world, what's working and what's not - and adapt accordingly.

And you haven't got a friend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
And all that you held sacred  
Falls down and does not mend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end*  

*When you're standing on the crossroads  
That you cannot comprehend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
And all your dreams have vanished  
And you don't know what's up the bend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end*  

*When the storm clouds gather round you  
And heavy rains descend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
And there's no-one there to comfort you  
With a helping hand to lend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end  
For the tree of life is growing  
Where the spirit never dies  
And the bright light of salvation  
Up in dark and empty skies  
When the cities are on fire  
With the burning flesh of men  
Just remember that death is not the end  
When you search in vain to find  
Some law-abiding citizen  
Just remember that death is not the end* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Really, this again? 

* The increase in minimum wage is stretched to 3 years, so there's really no reason to believe there's a connection now, unless you want to find one. 
* the official statement from the company is that prices increased by 10%. So where did the 14% came from? few items in few locations were increased by 14%. not the average price. Nobody went to check what's the cause for those items. could be wages could be not. We won't know if we won't check.
* Nationwide prices were increased by 4%, in SF by 10% on average. So again, we are talking about 6% premium. Where this number came from? Maybe real estate? maybe taxes? Maybe other places increase also by 6% compared to their increase some place else?
* unlike what people, chain restaurants like Chipotle don't rely on local markets for supplies. They have distribution centers. So price will only affect those working on site. It doesn't explain why certain ingredients increased more than others.  
* What about other restaurants? shouldn't we see 14% increase as well if the logic is so infallible?

I mean come on, you are going to see two 14% numbers and spit out all the regular well rehearsed material about minimum wage implications? 

We all know about the relation, we all know 101 economics, fine. But this article doesn't provide even anecdotal evidence to that connection. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Are you replying to me? because what you wrote doesn't make sense. 

I didn't say I'm Krugmanite, nor did I say I support loose monetary policy or Keynesianism. So really you are talking to yourself there (but hey, it's easy to win this argument, right?).

All I said is that it's hard to find example of austerity because very few countries have tried it. And if austerity policies are rare then successful ones are even harder to come by. 

Actually, I was repeating what you said! you dared the person you replied to come up with example of true austerity measured, and you are right. Those almost don't exist.

So you can argue pro austerity all you want, that's fine, but don't send anyone to history books because this chapter is very thin and nothing can be concluded from it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Before you do that I recommend you actually find a country which really applied austerity

That's exactly the point. Most countries never applied austerity, yet all them recovered from recessions and depressions they faced in the past. Some even preferred to default on their debt. 

There are so few austerity case studies to learn anything from it. But there are plenty of examples of countries that spent/printed/inflated/defaulted/re-arranged and recovered successfully.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  you have to cut spending

No, you don't have to. 

A country can default on its debt ([lots of them did in the past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_defaults), probably more than people realize), or, as more common solution, print money to pay the creditors (and spend some domestically) and probably devalue the currency on the way.

Now, I'm not saying those are good solutions, but they are available solutions just like austerity. 

OP asked about Greece, so it's important to note that Greece doesn't have an option to print money (which is the real issue here) and defaulting also has some consequences that sovereign debtors usually don't face.

Very few countries in history, including those who defaulted, actually applied austerity measures.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay. The problem is that because we differentiate between one murder and another (and I'm not saying we shouldn't), it's almost impossible to determine those special circumstances you are talking about.

It's easy to look in hindsight and determine who should live and who should die, but it's very hard to write coherent laws that look *forward* and will cover different scenarios while being fair, not giving too much power to the state or too much loopholes to render them useless.  </TEXT>

1. IB is a broker with full paper trading, which I found out to be okay (they won't simulate slippage, so don't test illiquid instruments).
2. NinjaTrader is a platform that has simulated trading built in. You'll need to connect it to data feed or use Yahoo's 20 min delay data. The nice thing about NT is that after you leave the platform running and collecting real time data, you can replay it and run your strategy on that. It also has backtesting capabilities.  </TEXT>

*The man he knew as "Control" is dead, and the young Turks who forced him out now run the Circus. But George Smiley isn't quite ready for retirementespecially when a pretty, would-be defector surfaces with a shocking accusation: a Soviet mole has penetrated the highest level of British Intelligence. Relying only on his wits and a small, loyal cadre, Smiley recognizes the hand of Karlahis Moscow Centre nemesisand sets a trap to catch the traitor.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's less about the absolute wage and more about the difference between tech jobs and other jobs. 

For example, even if a tech job pays well in Sweden, a bright kid might prefer to take a less stressful job, like being a teacher. The salary is good enough and the premium wage of software engineering in a start-up isn't worth the stress, the long hours and the risk.

Now take a bright kid from a low income family in the US. For him working in a start-up or hi tech company - even if the pay is average - still can be the difference between living comfortably and barely escaping poverty.

The income inequality, which is greater in the US than any other country in Europe ^^[source](http://www.oecd.org/social/inequality.htm#income) , plays a big role in risk taking appetite.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can add a chrome keyboard shortcut, then write AHK script that sends that keyboard keys +  click on the on/off button. 

If you have trouble locating the on/off, you can use image locate on screen (screenshot two images, [like that](http://imgur.com/aq2QgLX,RJTSPee), and use [ImageSearch](http://ahkscript.org/docs/commands/ImageSearch.htm) to find either one, and click it. Don't use the images I uploaded because your might be different, depends on your screen resolution).

The script should look something like that (I wrote it here, so there might be typos):

    #ifwinactive ahk_class Chrome_WidgetWin_1
    ^F11:
    ;;assuming you assign CTRL+ALT+Z to ZenMate
    Send {CTRLDOWN}{ALTDOWN}z{ALTUP}{CTRLUP} 
    ;;adjust the sleep as needed
    Sleep 500
    
    FoundX:=0
    FoundY:=0
    ImageSearch, FoundX, FoundY, 0, 0, 2000, 2000, zen_on.png
    if ErrorLevel = 1
    {
    ;;zen_on.png not on screen, so search for off
    ImageSearch, FoundX, FoundY, 0, 0, 2000, 2000, zen_off.png
    }
    if FoundX0
    {
    ;;adjust for your resolution
    FoundX:=FoundX+10
    FoundY:=FoundY+10
    Click, FoundX, FoundY
    }
    
    
    return


Don't forget to save the mouse location and return the cursor to its place. Also, try first just click on the button, its coordinates should be fixed relative to the chrome window. </TEXT>

<TEXT> By the way, I majored in Math. My best friend majored in Physics. I think his degree was much more difficult than mine. He thought the opposite. 

The difficult level got a lot to do with the student abilities towards certain areas. For me Math is easy. Physics is hard. Philosophy is much harder. Another friend of mine studied literature, and as much I love reading, I would probably have failed. 

My point was that getting the degree, compared to history, is trivial. For example, when my friend's father had his engineering degree 50 years back, there was 1 university in the country where he lived, with 35 spots open every year. You didn't make it? too bad, wait for next year. There was one store that sold books, there weren't exams databases, nobody offered him any loan. and for women there were dozens of other obstacles to overcome. And at his time, about 10% had a degree. today it's 50%. That says a lot.

<TEXT> Yeah, physics is also very trivial. 

Now, I'm not saying the studies are easy, far from it. Not in philosophy and neither in arts nor in physics. But it's simply very common. Getting into university or college, and getting a degree - any degree - isn't that special.

I didn't say anything about the difficulties of the studies, I personally would probably fail in philosophy, arts, and the other 90% of available degrees. But finding the degree that fits you and getting into high education - is not as hard as it used to (let's say 30 years ago).

<TEXT>  one of the greatest shames of modern education is emphasizing professionalization of undergraduates versus overall education

There is a good reason for that. In modern days overall education isn't a big achievement. High education is available to everybody, graduating isn't hard and in most cases isn't very expensive. Universities and colleges are bigger and more accessible than ever, some of them are even online. Getting a liberal art degree, or simply high education, doesn't give any bragging rights like it used to. 

So yeah, "Philosophy and many of the other liberal arts are legitimate fields of study", just don't expect a pat on the back for doing something very trivial nowadays.

The professional world however is getting more competitive by the day, with very limited spots and ever growing supply of candidates all over the world. 

---

edit: Okay, looks I didn't explain my point properly. **Nearly 40 percent of working-aged Americans now hold a college degree, according to a new report from the Lumina Foundation**. Something that 40% of population does **isn't special**.

I simply responded to "emphasizing professionalization of undergraduates versus overall education". Of course it does, because getting overall education is something that doesn't need any support.

I'm not saying anything about how difficult the studies are. The fact that 40% the work force gets a degree proves that it's **very achievable**.

And yes, I'm talking about any high education. STEM included. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The enormous increase in the quantity of currency precipitated an era of hyperinflation in the Confederacy as more dollars chased fewer goods. The price level in the South rose by roughly 10 percent per month during the conflict and by the end of the war, the price level had increased in the Confederacy by a factor of 92, though imports tended to inflate more quickly and exports more slowly. At the same time, the blockade, military destruction, and the loss of workers to the war caused real wages and output to fall dramatically, with per-capita consumption falling by 50 percent in real terms. Indeed, if banks had not sharply increased their reserve ratios for fear of bank runs, the inflation created by excess money in the South would likely have been even more severe.

 The Confederate government passed the Currency Reform Act of 1864 in an effort to stem the rampant inflation ravaging the South. The Act effectively removed one third of all currency in the South from circulation by mandating that all large denomination bills be converted to 4 percent Treasury bonds before April 1, 1864, and imposing a 3-to-2 redemption ratio for small bills after the deadline. As people tried to get rid of their large notes, velocity spiked and in the months prior to the deadline, inflation rose to 23 percent a month. In the summer of 1864, though, price levels in the Confederacy finally stabilized and even declined slightly, just as monetary theory would predict following a contraction in the money supply. However, in the face of continuing pressure to meet war obligations, Congress authorized the printing of an additional $275 million in August of 1864, mostly reversing the effects of the Currency Reform Act. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There could be dozens of reasons for that, and it's usually clear only in hindsight. The typical reasoning is that investors and money managers sees the USD as safer. Meaning, the risk at holding euro doesn't compensate enough relatively to the yield.

The effect on trade is causing European goods cheaper to USD holders and having USA goods more expensive to Euro holders. 

On one hand it strengthen the USD financial market (there's is more demand for financial instruments traded in dollar) and on the other hand it weakens the export companies that manufacture in USD and sell in Euro. 

There isn't a clear cut answer to the cause and effect. It's a complicated machine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The rate by itself doesn't mean much, it's just an arbitrary number. What you care about is the change in rate.

If one currency is getting more expensive compared to another, it means that this currency is in more demand compared to the second one. 

Why do people prefer to sell the second currency and get the first one? 

They think it's a better vehicle to keep value. Meaning, the first currency will keep its purchasing power better than the second currency. The value of the currency encapsulates interest rates, sovereign risk, inflation risks, future demand (by other investors) and future supply (by the central banks).

<TEXT> Personal experience in movies, and I would argue especially in comedies, got a lot to do with your personality *at that moment*. So it's not only whether this type of humor touches you, but also the mood you are at, the company you watch with, the theater experience, etc.

Sure, some movies are genuinely bad or brilliantly good, but for the majority of films, it's really a personal experience and timing. Someone can enjoy a movie and only later be aware of its flaws. If someone watches a movie with a notebook to write down used tropes, he isn't going to have a good time.

I used to hate comedies, but I learned to love them by letting go and matching them to my general mood. Hell, I even laughed in Horrible Bosses 2, a movie I wouldn't even dare watching few years back.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My current read. If you doubt your rational choices or if you think you are one supreme intelligent and rational creature, this book is for you.

[You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, and 46 Other Ways You're Deluding Yourself by David McRaney](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11709037-you-are-not-so-smart).

 Whether youre deciding which smart phone to purchase or which politician to believe, you think you are a rational being whose every decision is based on cool, detached logic, but heres the truth: You are not so smart. Youre just as deluded as the rest of us--but thats okay, because being deluded is part of being human.

 Growing out of David McRaneys popular blog, You Are Not So Smart reveals that every decision we make, every thought we contemplate, and every emotion we feel comes with a story we tell ourselves to explain them, but often these stories arent true. Each short chapter--covering topics such as Learned Helplessness, Selling Out, and the Illusion of Transparency--is like a psychology course with all the boring parts taken out.

 Bringing together popular science and psychology with humor and wit, You Are Not So Smart is a celebration of our irrational, thoroughly human behavior. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  money has been draining out of the market

Money cannot be drained out. For every seller there's a buyer. 

 stock market's cap has been increasing

This happens for specific companies because buyers and sellers are settling at higher prices. And on top of that, it happens at the total market if there are more IPOs than write-offs. 

 if US investors are net sellers of US equities, I must presume that foreign investors are net buyers

It doesn't matter really who's doing the buying or selling. for every buyer there's a seller.

The only argument that can be made is if the sellers are smarter than the buyers. So if, for example, you hear that some big shot hedge fund manager sold his FB shares and million barbers, taxi drivers, redditors and gas stations operators bought each a share, then you might argue that something is going on here.

Unfortunately, it's never a clear cut, only on extreme market conditions. And right now, this is not the case. I'm not saying that market will go up or down, I don't know. But I do know that this chart isn't any indication to what's going to happen.

<TEXT> This is BS article.

1. If we want regulated markets that protect small investors from doing stupid shit with their money, that's a reasonable and accepted part of the plan.

2. Most startups won't even accept investments of less than few hundred thousands dollars. So it makes sense to limit the investment to "accredited investors". 

3. If you do have half a million dollar, and it's all your money, and you really want to invest in some start up despite better judgement, there are easy and legal ways to achieve that. 

4. Most start ups fail. You know what else fails? This article. It doesn't mention the hundreds of start ups that go bust and give zero money back to investors, but instead keeps dropping names like Facebook and Linked In.

5. Most of the "accredited investors" are white men, but how is this relevant? It's like saying the Yacht market is blocked to black people. Wealth inequality exists,so let's deal with it. I don't see any added value by putting it in a stock market regulation article.

Edit: I just want to state how a good firewall is important. Lots of anti-virus, anti-malware will identify the keylogger, but they have lots of false positives. However, when a firewall prompts that a process wants access to outside world (send or receive), there should be a real good reason to allow it. Even if it's a legit program, 95% of them don't need (or shouldn't need) internet access to work properly. I can count on my hand the number of programs on my pc that get internet access. 

So in this case, even is the keylogger worked, it won't be able to send the data out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Last I heard was that Bradley won't return as Ronnie Brooks, which is a bummer. Does anybody know if more episodes are planned and when? I really like this adaptation, and my only complain is that they stick too much to the original scripts (And as a L O fan, means I pretty much know all the plot after the opening scene. Still liked it plenty though).

The word "socialism" isn't what it used to mean, and it means differently in different part of the world. So it changes through time and space. 

So don't be the guy, that when someone calls him "the guy" (like I just did) says in reply "actually, did you know that **guy** comes from the name of Guy Fawkes and it used to mean effigy, and I just hate it when people use it differently." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Where you leave, do politicians have immunity for murder? Can they buy M1 Abrams tanks for personal use with tax payer money? how come they can't? who's enacting those law? 

So to me, if I were a person who's okay with *The System*, I would simply point out that the same laws and regulations that prevent them from murdering and buying tanks should be extended to hookers and drugs. 

Most people think *The System* works, and any flaw can be fixed within *The System*. The flaws that can't be 100% fixed are tolerable and are justifiable cost to keep *The System* running.

Now, I'm not saying they are right or wrong, but I don't see how simply pointing out something that be fixed by law is going to convince anybody.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you want a cool variation without icecream (dairy free), try frozen banana and coconut cream as a base. It works great. Make sure to peel, slice before freezing the banana. 

To that you can add any fruit (like frozen strawberries, blueberries) or cocoa poweder or cookies or peanut butter.

For refreshing taste, try mint and vanilla.

If it's too thick (but then, how can a milkshake be too thick) add coconut milk. </TEXT>

Seriously? how about: "let's throw that politician in jail and outlaw hookers and blow." Sounds like a typical liberal answer.

The concept of taxes is accepted by most people and also by many libertarians. so I don't see how giving an example of one particular wasted taxes is going to change anyone's mind. 

Everybody knows that taxes aren't 100% effective. But all the people who accept the tax concept (which is the majority of people, right after they stop bitching about it) just argue on the amount and how to spend it. </TEXT>

No. Cellphone companies are trading electronics for money.

All those greatly consume battery life.

Exactly. Even if she '"caved" in direct response to pressure' as OP wrote, that's fine, and by no means should be interpreted as a negative thing. Different people reacts differently to pressure, and she has every right to avoid difficult situations (if we assume it's a reaction and not political statement, which she obviously entitled to).

Hell, I know people that don't go to work because they have a little headache in the morning and they don't feel like standing in traffic, so why should be surprised when artists decide to dodge when a century old conflict knocks on their door.

<TEXT> To answer seriously for a second, 'rape culture' means the socio-cultural environment encourages rape, or at least does nothing to prevent it, meaning, rape is seen as a normal act. 

I can tell this is true, because I wear suit and tie to meet clients. I'm literary raped by having to do that. Who's making me, you ask? Nobody, I'm self employed. This is how fucked and serious rape culture has become. I'm raping myself because it's what society expects of me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure what are you talking about. Create a shortcut called "Sound Playback" with the following target:

    C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL mmsys.cpl,,0

Create ahk script that runs it:

    Run, Sound Playback.lnk

Activate the window:

    Sleep, 100
    WinWait, Sound, 
    IfWinNotActive, Sound, , WinActivate, Sound, 
    WinWaitActive, Sound, 

use arrows to select the BT device (let's assume it's 3rd on the list)

    Send, {DOWN}{DOWN}

Hit context menu, and choose disable/enable

    Send, {APPSKEY}{DOWN}{DOWN}{ENTER}

I'm sure with 10 minutes tweaking and testing this can easily be done.

<TEXT> You are talking about 3000 years ago, so I think it's worth mentioning that according to Jewish law, 13 is the adult age, in which a boy  becomes accountable for their actions (12 for girls). The ritual is called Bar Mitzva. Part of the ritual is the father, thanking God that he's no longer responsible for his son's actions. http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2473-bar-mizwah </TEXT>

<TEXT> [ Kendrick Lamar - i](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aShfolR6w8) - love yourself this summer.

In Baltimor, summer started early:

They wanna say there's a war outside and a bomb in the street  
And a gun in the hood and a mob of police  
And a rock on the corner and a line full of fiends  
And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme, yup  
These days of frustration keep y'all on tucking rotation  
I duck these gold faces, post up fee-fi-fo-fum bases  
Dreams of realities peace  
Blow steam in the face of the beast  
The sky can fall down, the wind can cry now  
The strong in me, I still smile  

 I love myself  
(The world is a ghetto with guns and picket signs)  
I love myself  
(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind)  
I love myself  
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)  
I love myself  
(One day at the time, sun gone shine)   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Absolutely. If you can love a dog, feed him and put a roof over his head - get one. It's a win win situation. Dogs are very adaptive to their owner habits. If you leave early and get home late, the dog will get used it and probably sleep comfortably the whole time.

Edit: lots of people are saying that this isn't healthy, and I agree that it's not ideal. However, I replied to someone who compared adopting a dog to a dog living in a cage. This is far better life. And yes, you got to compensate for the time you are missing:

* wake up earlier to take the dog for a walk. If you can go on an early jog, that would be great. The dog will love it. it shouldn't even be a long jog, 2 miles is a good distance for a dog. [check this chart please](http://www.runnersworld.com/sites/default/files/dogs500.jpg).
* take long walks with him at night, if it's a big dog that can run the distance (see chart above), consider using a bicycle.
* whenever you have a day off, take the dog with you, stop at the beach or at the park. 
* those are good ideas not only for the dog, but for you as well.
* consider getting a walker. Depends on where you live, those shouldn't cost much. If you can't find one, you can also talk to a kid in your neighborhood that will take the dog out after school for few bucks.

Anyway, while I hear lots of those comments and agree with them, remember that the most important thing you can for a dog is to love him, show your affection, communicate with him, feed him properly and have fun with him while you are around. so if you are busy, it might not be 100% ideal, but not everything in life is. This is still better than a dog sitting in a cage in some shelter where he feels like nobody.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As other have explained, it's a matter of percentage within population. 

There's also another (unmeasurable) issue: how much of it justifiable? I'm not talking just about the final kill, but life events. For example, if [white kids are more likely to sell drugs, but black kids are more likely to go to prison for drug charges](http://www.csdp.org/publicservice/kids.htm), then black kids are more likely to grow up as criminals and have future trouble with the law. 

So even if all police harassment is race-blind, there are still underlying issues that increases the chances of black people to be involved in such incidents.

There's nothing wrong with ID all by itself. However, in the current social environment and ID issues, lack of ID targets very specific demographics. 

If, let's say, there's a major move to provide everyone with ID ([like many other countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_identity_card_policies_by_country#Countries_with_compulsory_identity_cards)), then it would be reasonable to force ID when voting after a grace period of few years. </TEXT>

Well, his economic views are as far from libertarianism as possible. 

I mean he's mostly against free trade, pro minimum wage, pro workers rights by law, heavy wallstreet regulation, etc. and there's the government intervention/stimulation angle which most Libertarian economists are against.

<TEXT> As a stock trader I can tell you one thing: You can't mix stock market opinions with political ideology. If you want to make money in the market, put your thoughts/beliefs/tribe aside during trading hours, and treat the market like a book to read from and your positions like a blank paper to write into. 

ZH never picked one of the two. So the results were 5 years trying to anticipate the next market crash that didn't happen. And when you are dead wrong for so long, you stop attracting reasonable people, and start pulling perma-bears and nut cases. Not because it's stupid to predict a crash (it's stupid to predict anything in the market), but because they predict using all the wrong reasons and sticking with it too long.

ZH best moments were when he/they put real inside information from the financial world. their downfall was that every inside story was accompanied by bad market crash predictions and ridiculous conclusions. 

So my stupid prediction is that when ZH  becomes completely  irrelevant or shuts down - that's when the bull market ends.  </TEXT>

That's true, but I think the X here implies some **minimal level** of education, healthcare, living income, water, infrastructure etc.

So they are not saying they want every American to have the same education, just that they want every American to have at least good education. If some can get more, good for them.  </TEXT>

Saying it's a "moral crisis" brings us back decades as far as understanding gay people. 

I personally don't think that it's a make or break for a president, but it's a sure one big minus. 

I also expect his position to turn if he wins the Republican nomination and moves to the national stage. There's no way he's going to stick with the moral argument on general election.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It costs lots of money because very few, if any at all, are issued each year. Almost all of the market is secondary (between old drivers to new) so prices go up. Taxi drivers are the first to object to issuing more medallions because they don't want more competition. 

In many cities there are few large taxi businesses which own all the licenses and they rent them to individual drivers. This way they maximize its usage (the license drives 24/7) and sees its value goes up due to lack of supply, which they fight hard to keep it that way. They are also in position to outbid any new player. Many banks will use the other medallions the business owns as a collateral for a loan for new medallion.

The second reason is interest rates. When interest rates are low, such as today, all yielding products, from bonds to real estates to medallions go up in price to adjust for lower return.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> From the book [AFFC, Ch6]: 

 Fear cuts deeper than swords, she told herself. Arya. She whispered the word the first time. The second time she threw it at him. I am Arya, of House Stark.

 You are, he said, but the House of Black and White is no place for Arya, of House Stark.

 Please, she said. I have no place to go.

 Do you fear death?

 She bit her lip. No.

 Let us see. The priest lowered his cowl. Beneath he had no face; only a yellowed skull with a few scraps of skin still clinging to the cheeks, and a white worm wriggling from one empty eye socket. Kiss me, child, he croaked, in a voice as dry and husky as a death rattle.

 Does he think to scare me? Arya kissed him where his nose should be and plucked the grave worm from his eye to eat it, but it melted like a shadow in her hand.
The yellow skull was melting too, and the kindliest old man that she had ever seen was smiling down at her. No one has ever tried to eat my worm before, he said. Are you hungry, child?

 Yes, she thought, but not for food

<TEXT> As someone who worked a lot with dogs, I must say that he got the main idea. However, it's almost impossible to implement in real life, especially if the dog is trained to arrack (like k9). A more reasonable approach would be to give up the hand, there's nothing you can really do to avoid it. Try to minimize the distance, don't hit or kick (they won't feel anything anyway), and if you are close enough try to fall on the do and position yourself behind his head. If you fell on the ground and the dog isn't beneath you (most chances for trained dogs), you lost. </TEXT>

You expect from a waiter in this kind of restaurant to explain the dishes fluently and the way they are made, to match wines and other drinks (even if they have a sommelier), to bring your food exactly when it's ready, to serve just 2-3 tables at a time, etc. Now, if you think that's not worth the tip, then it's fine, you don't have to visit the restaurant.

<TEXT> Person of Interest. It's a broadcast series, so 20+ episodes/season, some of the episodes are case of the week type, but there's a long arc. The characters are developed steadily, the story gets more and more complicated, and some of the dialogs and one-liners are great.

<TEXT> I wonder if she's aware that there are about billion whites living on planet earth. Just 20% of them are in America. And even fewer than that had anything to do with slavery back then. Almost none of them have anything to do with [slavery today](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Modern_incidence_of_slavery.png) (which I would say is a bigger problem than an issue 150 years ago, but that's none of my business). 

In fact, white people probably contributed (and still contributing) more than any other ethnic/race group to stop slavery.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not necessarily the largest and not necessarily bailout, but many do enjoy government's help. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying their existence is depended on this help or that it's a big part of their survival. I'm saying that it does exist.

Here are top 10% names (rank below 50) from F500 (not the S P):

* J.P. Morgan (#18) - all banks rely heavily on Fed short term loans. The target interest rate is basically a guaranteed loan to the business which they can take and leverage other loans to retails at higher rate. Most banks on the list have this privilege. Also, specifically on JPM, the fire sales of BS during the 2008 was a government deal (backing up BS bad debt).  
Citi (#26) was obviously totally saved.  
BoA (#21) received $50B TARP + $100B losses cover during 2009.

* Verizon (#16), AT T (#11) and other networking companies enjoy shielding regulations and limited competition. 

* Exxon Mobil (#2), Chevron (#3), Valero (#10) and other oil companies do enjoy some nice specifics [tax breaks](http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/business/Oil_and_Gas_Breaks.JPG). Shell (#2 on the global F500 list) is also getting $1.5B tax break from Pennsylvania.

* Berkshire Hathaway (#4) - didn't take money directly, but some holdings did (GS (#74), BoA (#21), M T for example). You can probably add rail stimulus money to Burlington Northern.

* GE (#9) got government backup for $139 Billion of its debt. GE is also getting almost half a billion a year from different states.

* Boeing (#30) is getting $200M from South Carolina and another $100M from other states.

* GM (#7), Ford (#8) - $80B government help.

* Fannie Mae (#13) together with Freddie Mac (#32)  - huge bailout (takeover basically).

<TEXT> The French director is Michel Gondry, who directed Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and also won an Original Screenplay Oscar on that film. 

The documentary, *Is the Man Who is Tall Happy?*, is nice, but it's mostly about languages and how they emerge. It's more of a conversation than a documentary, so it gets heavy and repetitive (so does the animation). Worth a shot by all means, but it's not a brilliant film.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Look, you are right by using 'demanding'. I never said someone wrongs you by not refunding.

 However, if I'm in a restaurant, the waiter asks me how's the food even after I'm done, and I say I didn't like it. It's a good and reasonable practice to suggest a replacement, offer desert or even not charge. Lots of restaurants will do that. Also, more importantly, lots of customers will not demand a full refund. I personally found myself in few situations where I didn't expect refund. Most people are reasonable. 

My point is: if you as a customer didn't enjoy your game, it's perfectly reasonable to ask for a refund. If you are a game developer, it's also reasonable to offer a refund.

The fact that you 'consumed' the experience got nothing to do with it.

 When I told Costco my printer didn't work afrer 3 damn years, they refunded me. And we all know the old printer is 'consumed' and probably going to the trash bin. It's a good and reasonable business policy. And gamers should know that. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  You can't get a refund just because you didn't like it

I disagree here. I buy a kindle book, I can return it. I buy digital album from Amazon, I can return it. Amazon doesn't ask me why and how far I got into the book (they ask, but for survey purposes). You buy a book from B N, you can return it back, even if you read it.

Some people always going to abuse the system, that's part of doing business. some people are taking third refill and throw the full cup to the trash. 

 You are paying for an experience

I'm not paying to watch a movie, I'm paying for having a good time. I'm not paying for words on paper, I'm paying to enjoy reading a book. If I didn't have a good time, I didn't get my money worth. Sure, it's partly my problem, but it's also partly the seller problem. 

Guess what. Make good music, make good movies and good games, perform good shows and 99% of the people won't ask for refund. In fact, your business will double because people won't be afraid to take a chance and try your experience. 

**Most people aren't trying to game the system**.

 that is really a luxury, not a right

Of course. I never talked about some basic human right or whatever. Just something that I expect from businesses I work with. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think it's a fair comparison. Hannibal, the films, had only two legit movies: the Silence of the Lambs and Reg Dragon (the other films were written just to cash in on tSotL success). In both of them, Hannibal isn't the main character. 

In fact, Anthony Hopkins Oscar winning performance in tSotL was limited to 15 minutes only (second shortest performance to win an Oscar). So the fact that he made a legendary villain in such a short screen time, spending most of it behind bars, says a lot about the actor and the writing/directing.

TV Hannibal gives lots of time to explore the character and his motivation. 2 seasons in, where the second half of each season is devoted to Will/Hannibal conflict, gives a lot to work with.

TV Hannibal also had enough time to introduce another character: Dr. Bedelia Du Maurier (Hannibal's psychiatrist) which is a whole new avenue of character exploration. And on that note, I also like to add that TV Hannibal can allow itself to be very slow with lots and lots of one-on-one talks. 

With 2 psychiatrists (Hannibal, Du Maurier), 1 psychology professor (Bloom) and 1 criminal profiler (Graham) (edit: I'm adding +1 psychiatrist as Chilton) - almost every conversation feels like a therapy session. So no wonder we understand the characters better.

The TV show main challenge is exactly the opposite: keeping some mystery to the character (which I think they are doing a great job at).   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Transsexual don't identify with a their born sex. They work to change their gender, usually through medical intervention. It's a medical condition (GID). 

Transgenders usually just switch and play with their gender. Move back and forth. It's more of a social identity/challenge and less physical/medical issue. 

Transsexuals know their true (mental) gender, it's not what they were born with, and they are working to achieve it. Transgenders, however, don't commit to their true gender, and they feel comfortable in both genders (or don't feel comfortable in any of them).

He's a comedian, so I guess humor is his comfort zone, which is understandable and it's not like I know any better about these sorts of stuff. 

Overall, he got the message a cross and wasn't afraid to criticize Snowden/NYT. I also liked that Snowden didn't try to sugarcoat what they called "the fuck-up". He simply said mistakes happen, and being free also means dealing responsibly and accepting those mistakes, instead of silencing everyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's like saying that you are inspired by athletes' quotes only if they won the first place in every event they ever participate. 

People may struggle with depression every single day in their life. They fight the urge to end it all more often than not. The fact that they lost just one time, doesn't write off all their struggle and erase all their wisdom to that point.

Successful people with depression is, all by itself, very inspirational. A successful career is hard work day in day out. Regardless on how it's ended.

Anyway, all that besides the point because as other have mentioned, it's not his quote and he was a terminal patient who decided to euthanize himself. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  it takes practice which he doesn't seem to put in from the free throw line and never has

Maybe. I don't know his routine and I can't/won't defend him. So not putting any effort might be the case. Maybe he doesn't give a fuck, plain and simple. What I'm saying is that it's not likely. I also say, that as a general phenomena, we don't see correlation between improving shooting percentage and practice (at this level, I'm not talking about amateur players). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I can't tell specifically about Rondo. I mean, the guy is a pro player, he has any motivation in the world to be successful at his profession. And if it's something as easy as practicing more, he's probably doing that already.

He used to hit 60% at the start of his career and fell to 30% this season. This is either an abnormal reading (same as LeBron getting 4 points in the finals, or Kobe getting 80 points, but on a larger scale), a new trend, or he might hit a mental wall in his performance. 

Either way, I can't believe that simply training more or shooting extra 100 shots after a game (which he probably does) is what's gonna make a difference here. It might build confidence which is good, maybe take some pressure off, but it's not like this will improve his eye/hand coordination by 100%. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, you are right of course about the LoLN. I should have added that it's given as a way to explain my point, but not as something that mathematically describes the game.

Anyway, my point is that player's stats are pretty much locked in a tight range, and it takes practice to keep it that way. Saying that players with low % should just practice more, is being a little unfair to them. Most of the players in the league train close to what humanly possible with guidance from the best trainers in the world. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Put the shots in and get better at a skill that is required for your fucking job

It's really not that simple. If you (or any other human being) start playing basketball regularly, you'll reach your average numbers pretty quickly ([Law of large numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers)). After that, it'll be very hard to change those averages. Doesn't matter if you'll get $1m a month, if you shoot x%, you'll shoot x%. Sure some players see different stats over the years, but they are few and the change isn't very significant (1SD plus/minus). This change isn't often contributed to practice but to other factors like health, fatigue or just abnormal readings.

And some anecdote: Kobe Bryant is probably [the hardest working player in the past 2 decades](http://www.businessinsider.com/kobe-bryant-work-ethic-2013-2?op=1). His [FT% ranges](http://i.imgur.com/XBJcKOS.png) from 82% to 85% without any trend. His FG% ranges between 42% to 46%. That's extremely narrow range for 20 years pro career. It's like none of this practice really mattered.

So the fact is that practice around the clock is needed just to keep you on your averages.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, but I don't put automatic trailing command. I adjust it manually. For example, I can put the stop below the swing low. If the position still alive after few days, I might place the stop based on weekly chart. If the position moves up (or down if it's short) I might use ATR. If the stock had a trend that never violated X days moving average, I might use that line as a moving stop.

I must say that in my experience this is **a low probability** setup. Meaning, 8-9 times out of 10 I stopped out at a worse price than if I had just liquidized at target. However, the 1-2 exceptions usually make up for it. The hard part is keep doing that until it pays off. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me it depends on different factors. First, some of my systems are pure quant, so I always take 100% at target. Second, with some of the manual picks, I tend to place a stop near the target and let it run. The longer the position survive the more comfortable I am with wider stops (my trend is validated). Third, if the position is too big, which usually means that I miscalculated the volatility/risk, I'll trim large part of it at target (getting the risk wrong typically means I got other things wrong). And last, if it's the end of a quarter (like today) I tend to be more conservative and book profits early.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I look at it differently. I don't think it's a matter of friendship or respect. I think they have a strong bond. They feel connected. Same age, same childhood, similar hard families, weakness to the same woman... and almost similar fate (Raylan can easily image himself in Boyd's shoes and vice versa). They were also exposed to each other (Raylan letting Boyd leave after his father died, Boyd taking him to Nick Augustine). So I would say it's closest thing they have to a family. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The movie is an almost 20 years old sci-fi and still holds well today. On top of comedy, action and drama blend there's also great timing and a very nice soundtrack. Not a single dead minute in that movie. 

It's also worth noting that it was the second movie Luc Besson directed and wrote in English (after Leon: The Professional, which is also worth watching in case anybody missed it). Great launch to his career.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think the "no experience" is related to his physical and weaponry ability. You can be a super soldier, black op, spy and half alien. But if you never worked at a county police, never filled forms, never talked on the radio the way police officers do, never picked up the language, you'll be spotted immediately. So unless they cover that particular point, it's obviously unrealistic. 

I personally don't mind, because that's the premise of the show, that's the foundation. So by the end of the first episode, you either except it or you won't enjoy the story.

If I'm not mistaken, property creates value beyond personal need, i.e. any means of productions. So any land/factory/machinery/computers that are used to create stuff to be sold to other people are considered properties, and therefore, according to anarchists/communists cannot be privately held but belong to the common.  

Just a quick edit: maybe not belong to the common, but to all the workers who are working on that property.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's less a matter of the show being funny or not, but more a matter of structure. 

**Drama** is about conflict and resolution through action or personal change that often comes through a personal discovery process and sometimes life changing choices. **Comedy** is structured to serve the "joke" (or the absurd). Comedy conflicts are often based on misunderstandings or miscommunication for a reason: they don't require tough choices and personal change to be resolved. At the end of the comedy, the characters are usually on the same place as they started. 

Now, obviously this is a broad generalization, and we are lucky to have shows that are good in mixing and bending those structures.

However, in most shows is easy to tell where they lean or where they spend the most time. OitNB is drama (that is often funny). As an opposite example, Louis is a comedy (with some strong drama elements).

It's an interesting topic. But like both women say, there is mostly anecdotal stories (which they both use). The studies do support the social interaction that comes with AA meetings (and obviously can be arranged by other programs). The "12 steps" is however questionable. Yet it can be looked as a framework. For example, let's say I have a training program that allow people to get into shape and lose weight (that's equivalent to the social part of AA, meaning, that part that works). I also build my program around 12 steps in which I encourage the participants to reflect on the lives and what not. That might not be very helpful, but it gives some kind of framework and leveling experience.  </TEXT>

* **Wheels**: if you can you wobble it from side to side, it probably has some damage. Does it clear both sides and rotate straight? broken spokes? 

* **Brakes**: worn pads. Touch the wheel or the tyre. (brakes on general are hard to test, because the cables are hidden)

* **Chain**: Rust. Can you pull it easily out of the teeth? that's usually a sign for a worn chain.

* **Pedals**: Smooth spin, rattle free.

* **Frame**: look for dents, especially at the ends of each tube. If the fork looks bent or asymmetrical, it's a big red flag.

<TEXT> Sure thing. My two main devices are Android phone and android tablet. Usually during the day I'm with my phone, reading casually. At night I like using my tablet for better reading experience. Now, I'm not saying it's a huge issue by any means, but it's a real nice QOL. When I open my tablet, I need to skip all the posts that I already saw on my phone. 

I don't think it's something that needs to be solved on Reddit's level (i.e. using the API), it's a sync between BR (much like Amazon Kindle software that can sync the last page you read in each book across all devices in which the software is installed).

Anyway, maybe a nice feature for you think about in the future versions. I'm glad to see you read and respond to users. I have tried several apps and I keep coming back to BR, it gives me the best experience so keep doing what you doing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know that, like other people commented, a pro thief will steal your bike if he wanted to, regardless of your lock. However, you should lock your bikes properly against *casual* thieves, which are the majority: dishonest people passing by and see an opportunity.

Against them , what you need to do is:

1. Get a decent lock/chain that can't be cut easily with a cutter. Small U lock are great, but they also give you less flexibility. 

2. Get a massive lock, that isn't a combination lock.

3. Lock the bike to an object that can't be broken, cut or easily removed from the ground.

4. A combination of u lock and cable is good.

5. Use the U lock to wrap the object, the inside frame and the front wheel. Use the cable to wrap the object, back wheel, and rear triangle frame and maybe the chair if you have enough room below it to pass the cable.

<TEXT> I suggest that you saute the onions first in a skillet. That will greatly improve the flavor.

If you have enough time and don't want to use skillet, you can slowcook them for several hours before starting your dish. Or, the best option, slowcook large batch on onions (6-8) with some olive oil for 8 hours on low, then divide to 4 portions and freeze. Whenever a recipe calls for onions, add it from the freezer (no need to thaw).

<TEXT>  How is this any different?

Because food, cloths and entertainment aren't preserved as morally equal. I'm not saying those game farms are wrong or immoral, but I can see how it's on the far side of the scale.

Also, breeding animals for food (and the questionable living conditions and slaughtering techniques) is one of the major factors of lifting people above poverty and hunger levels. Many people simply couldn't afford meat if it wasn't delivered like that. While zoos and entertainment farms mostly serve the rich. So I think that point also add to the differences between them.

Anyway, at least those animals get a chance to escape their hunters, put up a fight and die in nature. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I adopted the recipe from [here]( http://www.myrecipes.com/m/recipe/black-bean-squash-chili).  
The only challenge is to peel the squash, but other than that, easy and tasty. I also added celery and stirred all the spices in the skillet together with the peppers, I think it brings up more flavors.
 
#Ingredients

* 1/4 cup olive oil 
* 3 onions, chopped 
* 4 cloves garlic, minced 
* 1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped 
* 1 green bell pepper, seeded and chopped 
* 2 jalapeos, seeded and minced 
* 4 15-oz. cans black beans, rinsed and drained 
* 2 14.5-oz. cans diced fire-roasted tomatoes 
* 3 tablespoons chili powder 
* 2 tablespoons cumin 
* 1 tablespoon dried oregano 
* 4 cups butternut squash (about 2 lb.), peeled, seeded and cut into 1/2-inch dice 
* Salt and pepper 

#Preparation

1. Warm oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saut onions until tender, about 3 minutes. Add garlic; saut 1 minute. Add bell peppers and jalapeos; saut until tender, about 3 minutes.
2. Transfer pepper mixture to slow cooker. Stir in beans, tomatoes, chili powder, cumin and oregano. Arrange squash on top. Cover and cook on low for 6 hours.

#Cooking the rice

In a pot heat 2 tablespoons of oil, add 1 cup of rice and stir to have it all covered. After 2 minutes add boiling water or chicken broth if you prefer more flavorful rice, bring to boil again and let it cook for 10 minutes on low burner. After that, remove from the heat and set it aside undisturbed for another 10 minutes.

<TEXT> I wouldn't go far and calling it a scam. There are some unique (and shady) characteristic in the industry:

* It's one of the few industries in which you pay, sometimes years, before you get the service with a chance that you might never actually get it. The company gets to keep the money (and invest it) without actually putting it to work towards the product.
* The standard procedure to get the service you paid for is to sue (either you sue the insurance company or they sue another company).
* It's one of the few industries in which the most important department is the legal department.
* There are lots of scams against insurance companies. It's probably the biggest victim of customers' theft.
* There's an information gap in a sense that the customer usually knows more about the product than the seller (typically it's the other way around).
* Some of the services are mandatory by law. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd like to add, in addition to response you got from /u/dragontamer5788, that if you do want to use leverage, it's better to leverage the entire account. Meaning, if you hold $10K in double leverage ETF, it's better to hold $20K in the underlying ETF and use half of it as leverage from the broker. 

Margin rates are extremely low now and you won't suffer from beta decay that was explained to you.

Overall, leverage ETFs are bad for long time holding periods. The last few years weren't a good example because the market didn't suffer a lot of volatility, but don't think this condition will last forever nor will you able to know in time when it changes. </TEXT>

Popular apps are [Strava](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.strava hl=en), [Endomondo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.endomondo.android), [Map My Ride](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapmyride.android2). The advantage of apps are social (even if you don't like sharing stuff with friends, you can browse and discover lots of routes), nice websites and no need for another device to buy and carry. The disadvantage is that you depend on your phone and its battery. Unlike GPS devices, it probably won't last 5-6 hours unless it's new or you carry an extra portable charger.

If you want to make a bet, then Strava and Endomondo are really good for it, because you can actually challenge your friends and you can see the progress.

 **MAHER**: Well, we've talked about it. I'm not into western medicine. That to me is a complete scare tactic. It just shows you, you can...

 **KING**: You mean you don't get a -- you don't get a flu shot?

 **MAHER**: A flu shot is the worst thing you can do.

 **KING**: Why? MAHER: Because it's got -- it's got mercury.

 **KING**: It prevents flu.

 **MAHER**: It doesn't prevent. First of all, that's...

 **KING**: I haven't had the flu in 25 years since I've been taking a flu shot.

 **MAHER**: Well, I hate to tell you, Larry, but if you have a flu shot for more than five years in a row, there's ten times the likelihood that you'll get Alzheimer's disease. I would stop getting your...

 **KING**: What did you say?

 **MAHER**: That went better in rehearsal but it was still good. Absolutely, no the defense against disease is to have a strong immune system. A flu shot just compromises your immune system.

 **KING**: So you don't take any western medicine, don't take an aspirin?

 **MAHER**: Never, an aspirin no. Thousands of people die from aspirin every year.

I also think that western medicine and health practice does a lot of things wrong, but flu vax isn't one of them. He's being stupid here.

I don't think GMO should be labeled, but I also don't see too much harm in it. Especially if virtually all food products will be labeled. It can be like ingredients. Salt isn't bad, but it's still written on the label. If someone wants to control their salt diet, he pays attention while most people don't give a fuck about that.

It's already labeled around the world in the EU and most of the developed countries. [EU: Traceability and labelling of GMOs](http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/environment/nature_and_biodiversity/l21170_en.htm). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good job man. I say keep track of your nutrition. 

Since you like riding long distances and also, if I get it correctly, want to lose weight, it's important to balance your diet. Consuming too little calories while training will increase the chances of fatigue and illness. 

At your pace (20 km/h), you'll burn about 8 calories per kg per hour. So if you weight 80kg and ride 4 hours, that would be 8x80x4 = 2,560 cal. If you want to lose weight, consume 20% less, so about 500 cal less. But try not to get less than that, so you can keep healthy.

If you want to lose half a kilo per week (which is what considered an healthy diet), you would need to consume 3,500 calories less than you burn over the course of the **week**.

Obviously those numbers are just for guidelines and it depends on a lot of other factors. It can still give you general estimation. </TEXT>

I think his anti vax position is the same as others so-called rich liberal hippies, who used to think it's cool and healthy, only to wake up one morning and see who else support their ideas.

<TEXT> You are right, I wasn't clear enough and I probably used the wrong terminology out of a hurry. Allow me to clarify.

**Economic efficiency**

If you were a young musician living in rural Wisconsin, it was almost impossible for you to get young listeners in Cleveland, Belgium, Australia, Hong Kong or Slovakia to hear your music and pay for it.

There were too many gates and too few competitive gate keepers between the artists and the consumer.

Therefor supply couldn't meet the real demand. And because of that, all the process in the middle and all the prices and compensations were distorted. 

(The other way around, from Australia, Hong Kong, Slovakia, Belgium **to** USA, was almost non existent). 

First you had to find a record company. Why? because printing vinyl records or compact disks is damn expensive. Distributing them is also expensive. Distributing where? to physical music stores, which also didn't exist abundantly in some markets or were under monopoly in other markets. Those stores also had limited space. How would the consumer even hear your music? The only option was radio and TV. In most of the world there were at best 2-3 variety channels, so the time you had to listen to **your** kind of music was probably 2-3 hours a week (This Top of the Pops and Radio1 in Britain, other places were even worst), that's it. So in the process you had to pass a Label, which held most of the power over you, then radio channel editor and a store manager with limited space. 

That means that everything in the middle: recording, printing, distrusting, art, stores, radio and TV - all were able to manipulate prices, not based on the music, but based on inefficient market conditions.

The market for independent musicians, those who complain today about high fees from iTunes, Google or Spotify, simply didn't exist (or was very minor) just 2 decades back.

By the way, even very successful artists would have killed for 30% flat fee on their sales. Out of $10 LP or $15 CD, artists [received $2 at best](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100712/23482610186.shtml). Only today you have an option to independently save up $25,000 (it's expensive, but competitive and not unheard of amount), record your first album, mix the music on your computer, put it on youtube, spotify, soundcould, bandcamp, itunes, and earn net 70% of the sales. A direct connection between you and the listener. Almost no gates and no gate keepers. So you get very closely to what you worth in the world. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 2 points about your quotes and 1 hard truth.

1. The artist says: shirt? No thanks. But he doesn't give any reason for that. Is selling a shirt too low for him? When it comes to music, merchandise are a way for fans to express their love and connection with the music. It's a service to fans, and one that pays back.

2. 'Apple charging 30% and not taking any risks'. That's false. Apple took huge risks in the past to get to this point today. They invested large amount of money in platform and devices way before they were common and far from being a safe bet. Technology works in a way that first you take all the risks, then, if you are one of the very few successful survivors, you get big profit and big margins. 

And to the hard truth: making music isn't that special. There are tons of good artists, they all have access now to mass audience, so the competition is tough.

There's really no reason to pay for something that exists abundantly. The old market wasn't efficient because record companies created artificial scarcity.  

If you are a small band, and you make good music, you are offering something that is offered by thousands more. Why would someone pay you premium for that, when the limited resource here is the time to listen to all the good music available. </TEXT>

<TEXT> How about Moneyball?

http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1301.Moneyball

*Billy Beane, general manager of MLB's Oakland A's and protagonist of Michael Lewis'sMoneyball, had a problem: how to win in the Major Leagues with a budget that's smaller than that of nearly every other team. Conventional wisdom long held that big name, highly athletic hitters and young pitchers with rocket arms were the ticket to success. But Beane and his staff, buoyed by massive amounts of carefully interpreted statistical data, believed that wins could be had by more affordable methods such as hitters with high on-base percentage and pitchers who get lots of ground outs. Given this information and a tight budget, Beane defied tradition and his own scouting department to build winning teams of young affordable players and inexpensive castoff veterans.* </TEXT>

But here's the thing. If you find yourself repeating, then there's something in the structure of your writing that needs changing.

Some think that imperialist foreign policy is the worst and some think taxes are the most important issue.

While there's still a lot to move forward in marriage equality, it's fair to say the gay couples are better off now than they were few years back and the **trend is likely to continue regardless of the person in office**. Other issues, not so much. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  It's basically the same as producing 3 feature films

Probably not. As much as those episodes have high production value compared to TV, it's still not close to a film. For example, the budget of The Imitation Game was about $15M. I doubt the budget for each episode is more than $2M. I bet that post takes much less time than a film, but I couldn't find any sources to back that up.

The answer has to be with the schedule of Cumberbatch   Freeman, both very busy and popular at the moment. I'm sure Hollywood pays more than the BBC and also provides more opportunities, so we can't really blame them for their priorities.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cereal bars usually aren't good enough because it takes time for them to digest and deliver calories to your body. Fruits and drinks are quicker and more efficient in that regard.

Overall, you should aim to consume about 150-200 calories per hour, depending on your pace. 1 banana will give you about 120 cal.

If you want to eat something more solid, like a sandwich (PB J will give you about 200 cal, depending on the bread), do it as part of a full 20-30 minutes stop.

**Basic recipe for home made drink**: mix 1/3 cup of your favorite juice (orange, apple, cranberry and such), 4 tablespoon of sugar (should be around 60g), 1/4 teaspoon of salt with water to fill up 1L. That should give you around 250 calories per Liter, which is the recommended amount.

<TEXT> I play two games that have something that might be overkill, and they both have the same mechanics. In Dragon Age: Inquisition there are Focus skills and in Path of Exile there are Vaal skills. In both games you basically need to kill enemies to charge those skills (in DA:I the more you kill, the more powerful the skill becomes, up to 3 stages). When the skill is charged you can use it once, and needs to recharge it again. 

Overall I think it's a good mechanic that add some depth and tactic to the game. POE is ARPG so the skill get charged quickly, but in DA:I you need to be a bit more calculated if you want it available to a boss fight. </TEXT>

Hell, some of them even fall in roundabouts. Don't they know how to make a simple circle? of course they do, but it's more risky. So the question is: Is sidewalk hopping a good practice from risk/reward perspective?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm eating right now a superb sweet potato and lentil dish.

1. In a slow cooker, put 3 peeled, cut in chunks sweet potatoes. Carrots and 2 cups of lentils.
2. In a small skillet, heat oil, put some chopped onions. Add some spices: curry, cumin, salt, pepper, ginger root, garlic. Mix. Add 2 cups of chicken broth, stir for a minute and pour everything into the slow cooker.
3. Put on low heat for 6 hours.
4. If you have green beans, add them now, let it cook for another hour.

The recipe is based on that [one](http://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/slow-cooker-curried-sweet-potato-and-lentil-stew/841c60f3-3a01-4dec-bc31-c3e0c964a677), I just added more lentils and I prefer to saute onions before adding them to the cooker.

<TEXT> Here's **Jamaican Jerk Chicken** from the book: *Slow Cooker Classics from Around the World*.

----

*Jerking is a method of seasoning and cooking meat that dates back to the Carib-Arawak Indians who inhabited Jamaica. Meat is marinated in a spicy pastelike sauce and then cooked slowly. Originally cooks would puncture the meat with a sharp object and stuff the holes with a variety of spices. The meat would then be cooked in a deep pit lined with stones over burning pimento (allspice) wood, which gave it a unique smoky flavor.*

----

#Ingredients

* 1 cup chopped sweet onions, like Vidalia
*  cup chopped scallions
* 1 teaspoon dried thyme or 2 teaspoons fresh thyme
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* 1 teaspoon ground allspice
*  teaspoon ground nutmeg
*  teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 2 whole jalapeo peppers, sliced
* 3 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon canola oil
* 1 tablespoon cider vinegar
* 4 pounds cut-up chicken pieces, skin removed

#One day ahead

Place all ingredients except chicken in the bowl of a food processor. Puree, scraping down the sides of the bowl several times, until mixture is smooth. Place chicken in a large freezer-weight zipper bag. Pour marinade mixture into bag. Close bag and massage chicken so that all pieces are well coated with marinade. Refrigerate chicken in bag overnight.

#To cook

Remove chicken from marinade and place in a 4-quart slow cooker. Discard marinade. Cook on low setting for 3 hours, until chicken has cooked through but is not falling off the bone.

Preheat a gas grill to medium-hot, about 450F. Sear chicken for 2 minutes per side.

#To serve

Serve with steamed white rice or boiled fingerling potatoes.

----

*Jerk chicken usually calls for Scotch bonnet pepper, or the similar habanero. These are the hottest peppers in the capsicum family. I have lightened the spice in this recipe by using jalapeos, which are much milder. If you want to authenticate this recipe and love hot, hot, hot, substitute one scotch bonnet pepper for the jalapeos.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> That can be a good argument by itself, but still, the context is grammatical in nature. 

 I paved a road, you created a business (pause) you didn't build **that**.

The question is what *that* refers to. The road or the business? If it's the business, then we can argue your point (can the carpenter claim he built the house?) but if *that* refers to the road, then there isn't any argument, because that statement is true. You didn't build the road, the government did, and you (maybe) paid taxes. 

Should have used **those**. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   survivors guilt could have easily convinced her that she 'must have known'

According to her statement, unless her memory made that up also, her father straight up told her what he's doing:

 He told me he killed girls.  
Again and again.  
So he wouldn't have to kill me.

Overall, when I rewatched season 1, I noticed that Abigail is portrayed (hinted) to be clever, distant, borderline sociopath and definitely hiding something (as Alana told Jack after first meeting her). I think this also explains why Hannibal was drawn to her so much. He knew what she's capable of. 

I think that the trauma made her forget the role the she played and the stuff she knew, but as the season progressed she became more self aware.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> People who are claiming short selling is unethical simply don't understand how the market works and what motivates the players.

1. You are saying that short selling "promotes the spreading of false information". Here's the thing, short seller are the only players - ONLY PLAYERS - with a motivation to spread bad news. Companies, long holders, brokers, stock exchange, politicians - all care about good news. All want to sugar coat everything. All want the stock market in all time high day in day out, as long as the inevitable fall won't happen while they hold the potato.   
Short seller play a huge roll in unearthing information.

2. Short sellers also stop down trends. They have an incentive to book profit. During panics, they are a major force that actually buy stocks (to cover). Short sellers only profit when they are back in the market as buyers (as oppose to long holders who hold assets and not necessarily have to sell to realize profits).

3. Short selling ban isn't effective. It was stated even by the fed: [Short-Selling Bans Failed to Prevent U.S. Stock Price Declines - Federal Reserve Bank of New York](http://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/research/2012/rp120810.html).

4. Short selling plays a huge roll in arbitrage trading and forcing many financial instruments to behave as they should. For example, the reason ETFs are trading close to the indices they follow is because of short selling. If a certain ETF opens a gap from its index, arbitrage players long one and short the other. Because of that mechanism, regular retail investors can buy ETFs without worrying too much. </TEXT>

I guess infographic with arrows is catchy, but the questions should be: was the trend accelerated? was it reversed? are there other factors in play around the same time? did it stay the same *despite* other counter-factors? and so on.

<TEXT> There's a reason for that. If you are a stranger in a strange land, you often feel strongly the illusion of freedom. Especially if you have money. It's easy to live when you are off the grid, ignored by the day-to-day burdens like taxes, health insurance, career choices, family, kids.

Edit: another thing I'd like to add is that in free countries we feel unfree mostly because of what we hear by the media. See news and browse the internet looking for freedom, and you'll feel oppressed and depressed within a week. The flip side of it is when you travel to another country and you simply don't know what's going on around you. The dude is visiting China, one of the largest countries in the world with 1.5 Billion people, he's amazed of all the new things he learned, where in fact, it's like going to a safari in Africa, standing by the entrance and say: this is bullshit, there aren't any lions here, why people are so afraid? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm afraid you misunderstood me. I'm not saying checks and balances are a good thing. And I'm not saying courts are needed. 

I'm talking about the definition of democratic. And if courts sit within that definition. 

Democracy, is a form of ruling in which the people chooses representatives every once in a while, and those representatives rule the people. That's not my definition. That's the scholar definition. And a very narrow one. So we can work with that. If you go by the even narrower definition of "rule of the people", then obviously even a parliamentary system isn't democratic. That's fine, but we should work off the same base.

Some democracies are direct. People actually vote on laws. Some of the democracies are of indirect form: representatives make laws. Some of the democracies have few degrees: representatives pick other representatives. For example, the people votes for parties, the parties form a government with a prime minister. The people didn't vote directly for the prime minister, but they trust their elected to do so.

Still, all those forms fall within the scholar definition of democracy (again, not my definition, that's really not that interesting).

What I'm saying is that courts are an extension of that process. Same as the police. I elect someone, that person appoints chief of police (so by proxy, it's like I made that appointment), that chief of police goes back and arrests the person who elected him - **because that's what I, the people, want**. All still working within the democratic framework. 

Court is like the central bank or the FDA or the military or sub-committees - all extensions of the government and, by the democratic process, of the people. The fact that its power is used as a balance is irrelevant. So that's where you missed my point.

If, for example, the supreme court was going from father to son, or was a private company with no obligation to the general public. I would have agreed with you - it's undemocratic. If a constitution is irreversible and cannot be amended - it's undemocratic. If the king or queen has any role, it's undemocratic. 

Also, just to add something real quick: the fact that in some countries, high courts are appointed to life, is obviously undemocratic.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Courts being able overturn legislation is by the definition of most scholars technically undemocratic.

I'm not sure about that. First, in many cases courts are appointed/approved by the an elected officials (or their representatives), so they are democratic by proxy. Second, courts interpret the law, which was also written by elected officials. They don't make up new laws. So that's again democratic. Third, they find contradictions between the law and the constitution. Meaning, they make sure the legislative branch is operating within the boundaries of the law (you can't rob someone, they can't make laws that contradict other laws).

There can be some exceptions here and there (just like a president or prime minister overusing executive power), but the overall structure is still inherently democratic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, it's kind of a weird one. The husband is a high level manager in a weapon technology company. He and his wife relocated to Singapore for a couple of years to be his company's representative in the east. They lived really well over there. Just few months in, his wife got into coma. I really don't know the exact circumstances of that. She was treated there and he decided to stay (instead of moving back with her to his home country). He was able to get her mom a visa and flew her there also. 

A little more than a year passed, probably the longest year in his life,  and she woke up. After 1-2 weeks in the hospital (physical therapy, checks and such)  she was released. However, she was completely different person.

She started getting into mystical stuff, Buddhism, crystals, connection with the after life, tarot reading. She started playing guitar.

None of the things she had mattered to her. She hated the luxury apartment building they lived in, hated that she had a chauffeur and a maid, hated money and hated her husband's job. 

It's not like she was ungrateful or resentful. She was simply different. Anyway, that's how he described it. He loved her deeply, but it's like they had nothing in common. Almost felt like an arranged marriage. 

I met her couple of years ago (which was about 5 years after she left him) and she was nice, but very hard to talk to. She seemed detached a little bit. Still into that mystical stuff (I guess, because she mentioned something about my aura).

I don't know what happened to her while she was in a coma, and I don't know if other people react like that and how commom this is. But I guess it can change a person.  </TEXT>

Also, there's no guarantee she'll even want to be in a relationship after she wakes up. I know someone who woke up after a year of coma, and few months after divorced her husband. She wad changed, and needed time to find herself again. 

If she'll be in the same situation (who knows), OP will feel betrayed. It will crush him. But then again, you can't really blame her for that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Re Ponzi scheme. First I wouldn't call it a scheme. It's perfectly clear what's going on, and nobody is trying to deceive or sell a malfunction product here. 

Second, it does rely on a constant stream of paying people to support the previously paying people. Same way as an insurance company client who is depended on other clients, or the company won't have enough to pay him when needed.

Now, we don't need anybody to stop paying taxes, that's an extreme scenario. But what if life expectancy goes higher (without enhanced quality), meaning people will stop working at 70 but will live until 140? That's not far fetched, and it's actually the current trend. Or what if less people will decide to have children while immigration is staying low? Japan is facing that problem. 

I'm not saying SS is bad by any means, I'm glad societies have nets. However, we can't ignore the risk and the price of those programs. They might stop working.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of course, you are right. So the problem is shareholders aren't doing their job and rubber stamp other people's decisions. That needs to be changed. 

About institutional investors. This is only partially correct. The majority holders at large firms are institutional. But those are mostly mutual funds (Vanguard, Fidelity and such). The investors in those funds get to vote, and they even get periodically proxy vote by mail. If they ignore it, the fund will vote for them.

Anyway, saying that CEO get high compensation because of some committee is really putting the blame on the least significant part of the entire process.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  CEO compensation committee

I'm sorry but no committee is determining the CEO compensation. The committee, if exists - not all companies have it - is part of the board of directors and simply recommends the best salary they see fit. The board is the one that decides and approves compensations.

The board is also directly assigned by the shareholders. And many times CEO compensation goes to a vote by the shareholders.  Also, in some countries there's "say on pay" corporate laws, which means that even if the board made a salary decision without shareholders vote, they (the shareholders) are entitled to call the compensation to a vote and change it.

TL;DR instead of blaming the board is we should blame (the far being CEOs) shareholder. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, so that's a different point: no culture is really explored. Maybe that's right, I don't claim to support or oppose it. Western culture are familiar to the world (not just to western players), so it's hard to draw the line on where the exploration begins and when the knowing just exists. 

For example, I'm playing now Dragon Age: Inquisition. Knights Templar, Chantry, and other similar terms are all from the western christian history. They need little exploration, because they are known. If they used terms from the Yoruba religion, they would have needed much more exploration and explanation. 

Other games have hundreds of references to American culture (language, media, style, technology, appearance). The nuances are built in. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's the my method of cooking a perfect rice in a pot. It works every time. For me, it always tastes better than rice cooker. So give it a try:

1. Heat 1 spoon of olive oil in a pot with tight lid
2. Boil water in a separate pot (or use water boiler)
3. Add 1 chopped onion to the heated oil. Saute until soft and transparent.
4. Add 1 cup of rice to the pot. Stir it so it will all be covered in oil. about 2-3 minutes. This will prevent the rice from sticking, and it also hardens it a little.
5. At this point your water should be boiled and ready.
6. Add 1.75 cups of boiled water. Add another cup for extra cups of rice you used (so if you cooked 2 cups of rice, that would be 2.75 cups of water).
7. Stir just a little, make sure the water is boiling again and reduce the heat to a simmer (pretty much the minimal heat).
8. Let it cook for 20 minutes, don't touch it.
9. After 20 minutes, the onion should be on top of the rice and no water left in the pot. Uncover, stir gently with a fork, let it rest for 10 minutes.
10. That's it.

Now, the time of the cooking and the water ratio varies. It depends on the type of rice (short, medium or long grain, where it came from, etc.). So the best practice is to try on your favorite type and adjust the time and the water until you get a perfect result for your taste. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bob Dylan always had this anti establishment side in him. 

Obama on meeting Bob Dylan:

 Heres what I love about Dylan: He was exactly as youd expect he would be. He wouldnt come to the rehearsal; usually, all these guys are practicing before the set in the evening. He didnt want to take a picture with me; usually all the talent is dying to take a picture with me and Michelle before the show, but he didnt show up to that. He came in and played The Times They Are A-Changin. A beautiful rendition. The guy is so steeped in this stuff that he can just come up with some new arrangement, and the song sounds completely different. Finishes the song, steps off the stage  Im sitting right in the front row  comes up, shakes my hand, sort of tips his head, gives me just a little grin, and then leaves. And that was it  then he left. That was our only interaction with him. And I thought: Thats how you want Bob Dylan, right? You dont want him to be all cheesin and grinnin with you. You want him to be a little skeptical about the whole enterprise. So that was a real treat.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's a case for this being a 'right'.

You buy a pencil, you buy paper. You can draw on that paper whatever you want with your pencil. It's your property, it's your right.

You have 5 rooms in your house, you can turn them on and off in any way you like. You can light 2 rooms or 4 rooms. It's your house, your light, your right.

You have a harddrive with billions of bits. You can turn them on and off any way you want. It's your HD, your bits, your pc. BUT if you arrange your bits in a sequence that is similar (not even identical) to a song or a movie or a book, you suddenly break the law and it's not right anymore. Change the first bit, you are golden, change the 10th bit, immoral.

Digital copyright is basically saying someone owns that sequence of bits. Someone owns a number, and you can't copy that number.

<TEXT> But Microsoft doesn't need to be replaced. It can be merged, split or rebrand for the name to be forgotten. We are talking 50 years here, that's eternity in tech terms.

The name Microsoft doesn't have much value. It's not even a popular website or a product (vs. Windows, Office and such). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think a case can be made for Dr Who. First, it's an old show. Even the new seasons have that old vibe. I'm not saying it's bad in any way (nor do the millions of fans need my opinion). I'm saying that a modern US show will lool and feel very different. Second, the style of Dr is kinda cartoonish, where US television brings more realistic production. I don't know if it will be better, but it will sure be different.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Screenshot](http://imgur.com/6mW5L8m). [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com/x96Vmvmt).

Have you ever dc and wanted to continue your conversation or PM the group, but you didn't know their handles? 

As some of you know, PoE keeps chat logs, among other stuff, in a file called client.txt. I wrote a simple script that reads this file (from the end, because it can be very large), and displays them in 4 separate tabs: global, private, group and trade. 

Notes:

* Download the pastebin file, save as .ahk and run. You'll need AutoHotKey 1.1 and above.
* Default client.txt path is  *C:\Program Files (x86)\Grinding Gear Games\Path of Exile\logs\Client.txt* - this can be changed in the script to match your installation settings.
* Default number of characters to read (from the end of the file) is 50000. This can also be changed. bigger number will give more chat messages but longer reading time.
* client.txt should be bigger than that number.

Have fun, and I hope you'll find it useful.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Self found players - how do you do it? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-16 00:42:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This league I decided to make it more challenging for me and try to be self found only. 

Usually my strategy so far was to pick and use gear up until A3M (group rushing the major bosses in cruel), and get to City of Sarn underleveled and undergeared. At this point I farm currency, adding up to what I already have and get basic gear to carry me through A3M and low level maps (life/es/res).

Alright, so I hit A3M 2 days ago, and I also hit a wall. For the life of me, I couldn't find any decent gear in the past 2 days farming Docks. My resists were around 0%, and obviously you can't survive much like that. 

As much I love this challenge, about an hour ago, I gave up, spent about 8c and got all the gear I need for now.

So after my failed attempt, I really wonder how you do it? how long does it take? did you have any luck so far this league? Do you do it for the challenge or do you just hate trading?

<DATE> 2014-12-13 08:01:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First, a major issue was fixed/set-right: if your default allocation is set to Permanent, and you open a new instance (solo) - the area's allocation will be set to Permanent. Great.

However, I did notice that group's allocation tend to change. We played Graveyard is was PA, went into the cave - it was changed to SA. Same with dock runs. Maybe it's because the leader changed, maybe the first person who entered into the instance. I'm no sure, but I do believe it's happening.

Am I wrong here? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Gallery mode is when media is displayed 100% width/height of the browser windows (or full screen), other text is gone except title. Back/Forward (or space) jumps to the next media. Other keyboard shortcuts can be used to upvote/downvote/hide (and automatically advance), open comments, etc.

There are some external sites that provide that for Reddit, but none is very good and most don't integrate well with Reddit (voting, saving, hiding, etc.), plus they require credentials which is less secure. 

I think it would be a good and useful addition to RES. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you haven't watched the first series, now is a good chance before second season starts. [Gillian Anderson and Jamie Dornan](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/23/1411511698254/Jamie-Dornan-and-Gillian--014.jpg) in an excellent british/irish crime drama.

The first series is only 5 episodes. And if I'm not mistaken, you can find it on Netflix.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I always create a group before going into maps (i farm masters, so I want to share it PA) - the group is created **public**. I cannot change it to private until someone joins. Why is that? it doesn't make sense. 

Also, when the last person (besides me) leaves or even if I kick the last person - the group closes (sometimes it doesn't, I haven't figured out when) and I need to create a new one. Why is that? 

I should be able to create a perma private group. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-10-18 11:48:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm trying to use life formula to match my actual number, and I'm coming short. 

According to the wiki:

     Life = (38 + (Level * 12) + (Strength / 2) + additive modifiers) * (100% + multiplicative modifiers)

On the gear I have +288 life and +36% to max life (Belly of the Beast). Per PoEBuilder I have +20/+138% from the tree.

So the calculation coming up as:

    Life = (38 + (86 * 12) + (213 / 2) + 20 + 288) * (100% +36% + 138%) =   4067

My life is just over 4200, so where am I missing 200 HP?

<TITLE> I'm looking for a simple script that reads shortcut (.lnk files) from a folder, and adds them as buttons to a GUI </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-10 15:48:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Preferably wrapped up in a GroupBox. Any hints and ideas? Thanks. (PS reading the files isn't the issue here, just the dynamically adding buttons inside a groupbox)

Update. Okay so basically I create those 2 functions, and I think it will work for me (the variables are self explanatory - x,y,w,h and some margins in between):


    add_group(group_number, group_name)
    {
    	global
    	group_y := (group_number - 1) * group_h + 10 
    	Gui, Add, GroupBox, xm ym+%group_y%  Section w%group_w% h%group_h% , %group_name%
    }

    add_button_to_group(sub_name, caption, is_first=false)
    {
    	global
    	if (is_first)
    	{
    		Gui, Add, Button,  xs+%gui_m% 			ys+%gui_m% w%gui_w%  h30 g%sub_name% , %caption%
    	}
    	else
    	{
    		Gui, Add, Button,  xp+%gui_w_margin% 	ys+%gui_m% w%gui_w%  h30 g%sub_name% , %caption%
    	}
    }

To use it, I simply call:

    add_group(1,"Shortcuts #1") 
    add_button_to_group("RunSomething1", "Name #1", true)

    add_group(2,"Shortcuts #2")
    add_button_to_group("RunSomething2", "Name #2", true)
    add_button_to_group("RunSomething3", "Name #3" )

<TITLE> Hi, I have couple of questions </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-20 18:05:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just downloaded it and gave it a try, the things I'm missing are:

* Is there a slideshow mode? in BaconReader I can view the post full screen (image, webpage, etc) and then slide right to the next one. Very convenient for image focused subs. Couldn't find this option here.
*  When clicking on a post on the front page, I get directly to the post content. Is there a way to get directly to the comments (skipping the slide up part)?
* Is there a way to collapse all comments by default?
* I have some subs I view often, but I don't want to subscribe to them. So I added them manually without subscribing, that's cool - just like BR. However when I sync my subs, the new ones were deleted. Is it a bug?

Thanks. The app looks great.

<TITLE> Book writers in Israel complained their books are sold too cheaply and they cant make a living. Government decided to intervene and fix the market. Guess what happened next. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-15 23:15:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> New books in Israel are published with a cover price of about $25. You probably think thats too expensive for a book. You are correct. So did the readers in Israel. 

The retail market is dominated by two major chains (have about 80% market share together). In order to compete and sell more books, they started selling them in bundles. Prices dropped constantly, until it settled at 4 books for $30. Thats right, about  of the cover price.

At that point book writers complained that because of the power the publishers have over their contracts, they barely make any money from books sales. 

Writers are paid about 10% of the paid price. So less than $1 for a book. In a very small Hebrew reading market. A best-seller book sells for about 50K copies in 2-4 years span.

Then the government decided to intervene and save the day.
The parliament passed a law last year saying that new books cannot be sold at a discount for the first year. Thats right. The arbitrary number the published picked cannot be changed by the retail seller.

The law came into effect this February. 3 months ago. Thats it.
The situation became dire very quickly. 

Books sales drastically dropped. One of the 2 retail chains is in financial troubles, stopped paying suppliers and will probably declare bankruptcy soon. Publishers stopped signing unknown writers. New books became expensive again, publishers and stores willing to bet on well-known writers only. Some publishers stated they are on the way to close the business. Most of the books that are sold now (75%) are those published before the law took effect and can be sold at deep discount. Independent and small book stores almost dont sell any new books now.

Some customers are saying that 4 books for $30 is too cheap. They say that a book is a cultural item that shouldnt be sold in a deep discount. The say writers should be able to make a living. They got lawmakers on their side, because supporting writers is the noble thing to do.

Well, the market proved them otherwise.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Edit: just adding a bit of a content here, as I never meant it to be love/hate post.

I like the Heat, they are playing my kind of basketball. But I never thought of them as a *steady* team (as opposed to another favorite team of mine, the Spurs, which surprisingly, never even made it twice in a row), so I was surprised to learn that fact today.

I'm not big on basketball history before 88-89, so I can't compare this team to 82 Lakers or 84 Celtics (those are just blurred memories of NBA games I watched as a child, in which the cool kids liked the Celtics, don't ask me why).

Also, I don't think the east is particularly weak in the past 4 years compared to the past 15-20 years. In fact, it looks much stronger. But I may be wrong here.

Anyway, they still got 2 wins to go, and this stat implying it's really not that straight forward to go over this hump. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Does Chain on Arc increase or decrease the chance to shock? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-03-24 12:46:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Let's say I use Arc with 40% chance of shock (10% from gem + 10% from quality + 20% from passive nodes). If I link Chain to it, I hit more enemies, and have better chance to trigger shock. However, Chain also reduces the damage considerably. If I understand this correctly, shock has a minimum duration that is derived from damage. So less damage means less duration, and if the duration is below the required minimum, shock won't trigger. 

Can anybody shed a light on this subject? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm currently using Moon+ Reader Pro for reading, and I'm happy with it, but I never found the speed reading to be very useful. 

I've just read this [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1yvvam/software_that_speeds_up_your_reading_to_500_words/) and I thought maybe I'll give other apps another shot.

My requirements are: ability to open any epub/mobi book on the device, speed settings, and one-sentence-at-a-time UI.

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Netflix's House of Cards is a great anti-government tv show </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-02-16 15:28:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> On the face of it, House of Cards is another political drama, telling the story of one congressman on his way to gain power. I usually hate this kind of television, telling us how great government is and how people with opposite views learn to come and work together. However, this show arguably provides the best criticism today on government and politics in their current form.

Nobody on the show cares about the public, and everybody's working out of self-preservation, narrow political interests, ego and selfishness. 

Bills, projects, acts, executive orders and such, are all introduced, executed, canceled, supported or opposed based on the political points, and almost never on 'what is right for the people'. It shows how people with political power can crash regular people and businesses standing in their way.

The writing is almost always cynic. Phrases like 'I have no ulterior motive here' are always there to hide something else. 

There's also some nice criticism on representative democracy. Season 1/2 **spoiler**: When the congressman sworn to VP (replacing the existing one), he looks at the camera and say: 'One heartbeat away from the presidency, and not a single vote cast in my name. Democracy is so overrated.'

Another nice touch is that the anti-hero is a democrat. So most of the people who abuses power and deceives are from the left.

Anyway, besides the criminal aspect of the story (which I think can be regarded as fiction and not a true demonstration of politicians) the entire system is pained in very unflattering colors. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Here's how to create RSS feed for the Daily Deals + alerts </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-28 16:39:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> If you are waiting for a particular deal on an item or just want to see the daily deal in your rss reader without checking the website everyday, here are instructions on how to it.

First, create RSS feed from the daily deal page. To do that, go to a site called [feed43](http://feed43.com/). It's free and no need to sign up. Click [Create your own feed](http://feed43.com/feed.html?action=new).

Step 1. 

Put in the page address: https://www.pathofexile.com/shop/category/daily-deals and click reload.

Step 2. 

Leave the first box empty (Global Search Pattern).

Put the following [text](http://pastebin.com/S3z7v82C) in the second box (Item Search Pattern):

    img class="itemImage" src="{%}"{*}/{*}h1 class="name"{%}/h1{*}div class="description"{%}/div{*}div class="label"{%}/div{*}div class="value"{%}/div{*}div class="totalCost"{%}/div

Click Extract.

Step 3.

Fill the properties:

* Feed Title: Path of Exile - Daily Deal RSS
* Feed Link: https://www.pathofexile.com/shop/category/daily-deals
* Feed Description: Path of Exile - Daily Deal RSS
* Item Title Template: {%2}
* Item Link Template: https://www.pathofexile.com/shop/category/daily-deals

Item content Template:

    
    {%2} - {%3}/br/br{%4}{%5}. strongDaily Deal: {%6}/strong/br/brimg src="{%1}"/

This is an [image](http://i.imgur.com/kMzdLJ4.png) of how step 3 looks like.


Click Preview and you are done. You can now take the feed URL and use it in your favorite RSS reader.

*Just a quick note: the reason I'm not sharing my feed (and neither should you) is because feed43 limits the pull requests to few hundreds a day. More than 500/hour will get the IP banned.*

*Also, this feed will break if/when GGG changes their html layout. I hope it won't happen often.*


Now that you have the feed and you want to create an email alert, you can use a service called [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/myrecipes/personal/new). There are some straight forward steps to create what they call a recipe. Simply choose **Feed** as a trigger - New Feed Item Matches - Keyword: put the item you are waiting for, like "Black Cat Pet", Feed: put the URL from feed43. - Create Trigger - Email - your email information.

That's it. Hope you found it helpful. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My personal tool for item evaluation (in Excel) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-16 10:30:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I see that many are asking about ways to evaluate items and decide which to keep and which to vendor. So I'm sharing my personal Excel spreadsheet. It's fast and gives a good snapshot about any Rare item.

First, here's a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/l3grWX6.png). And here's an [album](http://imgur.com/a/3aXcp) with more examples (but I'm going to use the first screenshot in my explanation below)

To use the excel, simply copy the item data in the game (Hover item, click Ctrl+C), then go to the spreadsheet and click the button. No need to paste, that's what the button does.
___
**Here's what you get** 
___

~~ The left table is straight forward and contains all the information about the item.

~~ The top-right table displays all the mods. 

* The rank column shows how the **minimum** range of the roll is ranked within the possible rolls. In the example above, *74% increased Energy Shield* is rank #3, because according to [poemods](http://www.poemods.com/index.php?item_type=helmet)   [PoE mods compendium](http://poetools.com/mods-compendium/), the possible rolls for % increase ES in helmet are:

iLvl|range|description
--|--|--
72 | 101 to 120 |(Unconquerable)
60 | 83 to 100 |(Dauntless)
44 | 65 to 82 |(Fearless)
30 | 47 to 64 |(Resolute)
18 | 29 to 46 |(Strong-Willed)
3 | 11 to 28 |(Protective)

So this roll is ranked #3 on the list. Obviously you want to see ranks 1 or 2.

* You can also notice that 2 mods are shaded. those are the 'sought-after' mods. It's not easy to compile a full list, so I did it just the basics:

If the mod contains: | with value above:
--|--
any Resistance	|20
all Elemental Resistance|	10
maximum Life|	60
maximum Mana|	40
increased Energy Shield|	60
increased Armour|	60
increased Evasion Rating|	60
Movement Speed|	20
increased Rarity|	15
increased Quantity|	15
+ to Gems level|	1
+ to Dex/Str/Int|	30
increased Spell Damage|	20

*If you have some knowledge in Excel, you'll be able to update this list, extend it and modify it to your needs*

~~ The middle right table displays the basic properties of the items.

* Here you'll see two ranks. The first is the rank of the item in the entire category, based on [the official list by GGG](http://www.pathofexile.com/item-data). So in the example above, this helmet is #21 on the list (where #1, [Lion Pelt](http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Lion_Pelt), is the best white helmet in the game).

* The second rank is how the item is within its armour specific category. Since the helmet in the example is ES, you want to know how it is ranked within the pure ES category (where [Hubris Circlet](http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Hubris_Circlet) is considered the #1 helmet). In this example, the helmet is just the 4th best so don't bother with it.

**You want to see items ranked #1 or #2**

*Note: the second rank is only valid to armour. Weapons have just a single category (ranks within wand, staff, 2H axe, etc.)*

~~ Finally, the bottom right table displays the Armour/Attack values and the implicit mods (Armour, Evasion, ES, Phy Damage, Ele Damage, etc)

* For Armour, the following rolls will get marked:

Armour Stats	| Level 1 | Level 2	
--|--|--
Evasion Rating	|800	|1000
Armour	|800	|1000
Energy Shield	|160	|200

**You want to look at those marked level 2**

____

**So what items should you keep?**
____

You want to keep items that have:

1. 2-3 desirable mods
2. Rolls are ranked #1
3. Item is ranked 1-2 within its category
4. The basic stats of the items are level 2 (end game)

About pricing (Domination): Don't get your hopes up. Items usually go for 1 chaos top (rarely 2-3, unless you got some exceptional luck with 4-5 desirable mods, no stupid mods, and high level). Especially if you found them in maps level 72 or less. My recommendation: if an item is in your stash for more than a week, lower the price to 1 alch, if it doesn't go, vendor it and move on. **Good items disappear almost instantly**, so if it's not selling, don't wait.

**Batch Mode (!)**
____

If you got this far you probably be happy to know that the spreadsheet supports batch evaluation. Here's how you do it. 

1. Install [this AHK script](http://pastebin.com/W76rk74T).

2. Copy the first item as usual (Ctrl+C)

3. Now go over the rest of the items and click Ctrl+Shift+C. If the item is rare, the data will be added to the clipboard (and not replace it)

4. After you copied up to 10 items, go to the spreadsheet and click the button

5. Now you can use the [up/down arrows](http://i.imgur.com/RZiQ8L0.png) to circle quickly through the items

You can get it from my [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kd9sbxj9zt8xanv/Path%20of%20Exile%20-%20Item%20Eval%20v1.0.xlsm).

Final notes:

* Please don't expect something perfect. It's meant for personal use. 
* Some less common mods are not mapped. 
* Some mods are overlapping (1H/2H/etc). So you might see double readings. 
* I mostly concentrated on Armour and not Weapons. 
* You gonna need Excel 2010, macro enabled (click enable content when prompted). 
* If it's not working for you, or if you have questions on how to expend it and add different values, feel free to pm me. </TEXT>
