<TEXT> Wow, your response definitely brings an important perspective to the conversation. If the following is too personal to answer, please feel free to not respond: what is it like having people look down at you for following orders that you couldn't break? It's easy enough to say what is the right or wrong thing to do when you're thousands of miles away from the conflict, but I cannot imagine what it's like having to face those delimas during a battle situation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When people think I'm a slacker just because I smoke weed. I'm not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but I finished my first year of college with all A's - albeit a few were A minuses - and have always worked hard to stay on top of my life's various workloads like job tasks, household chores, and responding promptly to both professional and casual messages. Bonus exasperation points if the person who is lecturing me is a person with poor work ethic but thinks s/he is superior because s/he doesn't smoke. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that viewing this situation in an empathetic manner is key. We should be empathetic for op who is a person who happens to be a guy; it's unfortunate that he was labeled as a rapist/sexual predator/etc. simply because he was walking in the same direction as a person who is a woman was walking. We should also be empathetic for the person who is a woman, however, because her feeling threatened by such a little thing is also unfortunate. While I am in no way condoning her being rude afterwards - wrongly accusing someone as being something as heinous as a sexual predator is not something that should just be brushed off and ignored because such a title carries significant social and legal repercussions for the person receiving the title - the fact that we live in a world where such caution needs to be taken shows that a problem of how we as a society handle sexual assault - both in terms of the treatment of the victims of the crime and the people who are wrongfully accused of committing or planning to commit such inhuman acts - does exist. In my perfect world, people who are women would not have to always feel fearful of being the victims of rape/sexual assualt/etc and people who are men would not have to live in fear of having their benign actions being viewed as lecherous motives.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would not recommend smoking in the dorms; the way the smell travels in a dorm and the risk of getting caught or tattled on by an RA, shitty roommate, or custodian could not only get you in trouble but also make you super paranoid. This warning being said, though, making stoner buddies is an awesome, easy process that helps with developing a new core of friends, and this process is much easier to do in a dorm because such a living area offers floor activities such as pillow fights, folf games, etc. and encourages residents to be comfortable with the people around them. Also, smoking off campus encourages you to go find cool outdoor spots, which beat out indoor spots any day of the week in my mind. The most important thing to remember, though, is that academics should take precedence when you're at college; you don't necessarily need to cut down on your habits, but be sure to tackle your school work before you toke. You're now having to pay for your education; make the most of it!  </TEXT>
