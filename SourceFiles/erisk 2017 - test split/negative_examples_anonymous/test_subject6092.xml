<TEXT> Play against  the computer. Start at whatever difficulty you want. If you're comfortable that's good. If it gets to the point where you aren't losing and are easily winning, go up a difficulty. If you just getting into soccer watching more and more of it can help you play fifa.
 I have a friend, he started playing it on fifa 13 and I would beat him 7-0, he now beats me most of the time, although he plays much more than I do.
Watching youtubers can help too. It may sound ridiculous or nerdy, but studying how others play can make you better.
Here are my tips: 
1. Be patient with the ball.
2. Be patient, but not too patient on defense.
3. Get comfortable with a few skill moves. 
4. Learn what's OP in the game, abuse it and learn how to stop it. 
5. Develop a style of play you're comfortable with. 
6. Be deadly with set pieces. (Free kicks have been OP for years now, and corners can get easy.)
7. Know the players you're using. (This might be the most important aspect. You don't want to try long shots with a guy who's long shot is 62. You don't want to head a ball in with a guy who has 50 heading accuracy. You should know weak and strong foot as well as skill moves for the players.)

<TEXT> Gervinho-Doumbia-Ibarbo for a cheap front 3. Although Cuadrado is solid too if you prefer him to Ibarbo.

But really, I've loved the NIF Griezmann. He's great, I have him in a team with NIF Pogba and Benzema linked up with him and Griezmann has been brilliant. I also use him as a super sub in my other squads. 

Reus is simply amazing and fairly cheap. 

I like NIF Bolasie is you know skill moves fairly well.

Enner Valencia is an amazing striker, and he is almost always in perfect position. He's poached plenty of goals for me. He's not rated highly and he's cheap. 2 star skills though, but unless you're a skiller that shouldn't matter. 

Wayne Rooney if you love long shots and strong strikers.

I've got a team with Doumbia and Teves, I think they compliment each other really well and Teves is a beast - very similar to Rooney I think. 

A brilliant CM for La Liga is Perez, I forget what team he is on. Great attributes across the card. 

I think the best CDM in the game is Khedira. Obviously he's slow, but he's been rock solid for me all year. 

For fullbacks, I've liked Evra, Luke Shaw, Kyle Walker the most. David Alaba is or was over 10k and I found him underwhelming. 

For center backs I like Benatia the most, although his high attacking work rate can be kind of annoying. I really like Rojo too.

My favorite goalkeeper in the game has been De Gea. No keeper has impressed me as much as he has or has saved me as many times. 

Also, Lewandowski has been one of my favorite strikers to play up front. Great long shots, positioning, solid speed and he's strong. 

Edit: Chicarito has been very fun to use as well.

<TEXT> So I loved the movie. One of my first impressions about 5 minutes in is oh that's Judy Greer. I like her! And then oh no horrible acting and fairly cheesy so far. And then it got nostalgic. And then it got somewhat funny and then we were being introduced to characters. Then it got tense and that tension turned into bad-assery. I would recommend it. Perfect movie theatre movie. I'll probably go see it in a theatre again. Worth it. Just don't expect it to be written well. If you go into a jurassic park movie expecting brilliant writing you clearly didn't look at the poster. The seller of this movie is the thrill, Chris Pratt being hunky and the magic felt from the original.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I'm looking around my league and I'm seeing guys like Neil Walker, George Springer, Ryan Zimmerman, Anibal Sanchez, Carlos Gonzalez and many other players that are not playing as well as it seems they should be able to. 

What are your prime buy low candidates right now?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So soon I'll be coming onto a decent amount of money, and I will be looking to invest at most $2,500 of it for now. 
I'm 21 years old, in college and I work part time making roughly $360 every 2 weeks. Right now I make it paycheck to paycheck, but once this money comes in (probably in the next 3 months) I will have a good safety net from it. 
I just want to turn this money into more money so I can pay some of my student loans off quicker.
I want that money to be safe though. 
I don't have any holdings aside from a 401k with about $2000 in it. (is that a holding?) 
No big debts yet, but I'll have some once I transfer to a 4 year school.
No house, no car, girlfriend is fairly needy though.
Thank you.
Also, I really have no clue what to do with this, but I'm a quick learner so if I could get any tips on books I could read to become a better investor that wold be really appreciated. Thanks again.

<TITLE> PC for School use and Gaming for about $1500 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-06 19:57:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

I will be using the laptop for school and gaming, as well as listening to a lot of music and watching a lot of movies and tv shows. I like to use Microsoft word and all that jazz. For games I will typically be playing GTA, FIFA, Cities Skylines and some various sport simulation games. 

**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

My maximum budget would be nothing higher than $1600.


**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

Probably won't be buying for about a month or so... I hope that doesn't actually matter. I don't mind if it's out of date, I'm just looking for an idea of what I need. 

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

Everything, tower, os, monitor, keyboard, mouse, controller, etc I'm not too sure

**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

Connecticut, USA

**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

Not reusing anything

**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

No overclocking

**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

I would like a large amount of storage

**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

Don't know

**Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**
I would like a copy of windows 7 included in the budget.

<TEXT> I watched the Manny and Floyd match, and I actually really enjoyed it. It seemed clear to me that Mayweather won because he dictated the pace every round except for two or three and when he was on the offensive it seemed well planned and much more impactful than Pac's offense. So after the fight I browse Facebook and a lot of people are saying it's bullshit that Pac lost and it's embarrassing how Mayweather ran around all fight. Before watching I did my research and expected Mayweather to win, and quite frankly I thought it would t be too close, and it really wasn't that close in my eyes. 
So when I check this subreddit out a couple days after the hype I notice that no one is really complaining about the fight and I figure that's because the people that go on here now actually know boxing.
I think Boxing might slide into competition for my 4th or 3rd favorite sport, behind baseball and soccer.

Also I have a question, was Ali more of a tactician (like people say Floyd is)? That's what my friend who is a small boxing fan said.  </TEXT>

They're not talking about anything interesting, when they talk it's absolutely one sided conversation or they're repeating stuff (West Virginians). It's terrible, I don't know if it's because I'm older now or if Kruk, Schilling and Shulman are terrible. They seem to jump to conclusions, make terrible attempts at jokes, repeat themselves and circle jerk.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> You just gotta work at it. It sounds like you need to work with adding, subtracting and dealing with negatives. That's the base you need to build to regain your math. Trust me, it's possible you just need to be determined to do it. I used to hate math, but I realized that I need it for what I want to do after college and this really helped. In my free time I would work on building my basic math and I've tried to stop using a calculator all together and it's pretty spectacular how far I've come. I started in remedial math level courses in college and now I can do some multi step problems in my head.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Best MLB2k franchise mode? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-18 23:40:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have xbox 360 so sadly I can't play the show. I'm wondering which MLB2k game offers the best franchise mode. I'm just wondering overall, because I have MLB2k10. I'm at the all star break and there are 7 pitchers with a sub 4 era. In the 2010-11 real MLB season there were 11 guys with a sub 3 era and roughly 25 with a sub 4 era. My main concern is stat simulation realism I guess. 

THANK YOU </TEXT>

If he hits over 275 and knocks in 20+ hrs I would say he's had a successful season and I'm sure most Yankee fans that want the team to win and do well this season are supporting him. </TEXT>

I was planning on taking a nice shower and making some BBQ chicken for dinner. So now I haven't eaten in several hours, I feel gross and Im exhausted. I also get to look forward to sleeping on the floor again tonight and possibly not eating until the morning. Also going to work in the same clothes, unshowered, teeth unbrushed and phone dead. I would've love to have at least been told that this would be happening tonight. I mean what the hell bro.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Small italian restaurant in Brooklyn </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-21 04:52:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay so I realize that this will be very tough to figure out considering the abundance of italian places in Brooklyn. I recently went on a trip to Brooklyn and we were taken to a very small and nice italian restaurant. Unfortunately I can't ask the person that took us to the place. So I'll try to narrow it down with the details I know of. Okay so the waitresses there all wore black and white stripes and had red bows or something around their neck. They served water in a tall green bottle. The menu was all in italian. It's also only a few blocks from the Barclays center and farther from the water than it. Now that's all I can think of. I'm really sorry. I can't even remember the name of the street it was on, normally I'm good at remembering names, but this slipped by mind.  </TEXT>

She is on birth control and has been for 3 weeks (3rd week just started) and was previously on a different birth control pill for 2 months. We both lost our virginity to each other about a month ago and have already got plan B twice. Should we be worried about her getting pregnant? We are both 21 and in college and do not want a kid or kids at the moment. Thanks for any input. I'm not too worried about it, but she seems a bit shooken up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel as if this only applies to western society, but regardless I can only speak for western society. They're finding that interior happiness is being replaced by exterior happiness. People have a want for immediate pleasure now such as a high from a drug instead of prolonged pleasure such as success from something you worked hard on. People would rather buy the new shoe, new phone or car than they would buy themselves a gardening kit, a guitar or telescope. More things are available to us in this day and age, but unfortunately those things are changing what makes us happy. We need immediate happiness and closure to feel good about ourselves which of course only lasts for a little bit until something new comes out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am up 21. I have Cody Parkey. My opponent has McCoy, Maclin and the Eagles D/ST. I'm projected to win by two. I'm worried. A win here will knock my opponent out of a two way tie in second to a potential 3 way tie for second. Likely scenario is he's knocked into a 2 way for third with me. Best case is Darren Sproles and Kelvin Benjamin combine for at least 29 and I keep onto my lead. That will cause the 3 way tie in second.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah I think Denver's D is underrated and Seattle's is overrated. Eli has been solid-good this year and I think he can keep it up. Surprising he hasn't dipped without Cruz. As a giants fan I can only wish Cruz never got hurt.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recently posted trying to get some ideas of ways to make some more money and I would like to thank those who helped! I have some ideas buzzing around to start up a small scale tutoring service at my college and hopefully that helps out a bit. 

Although I have a job I'm not making what I need to make to afford my rent right now. I would love a quick relief for at least a month of rent. My rent is only 400 a month. I fell behind because I had to miss a good amount of work and it sent my life a little out of control. I would love to be able to give my landlord at least 1 month of rent ASAP. My fortunately at this pace I won't be able to pay it all off until sometime in 2015 and who knows if my landlord is going to be forgiving? 

Here is a link to my gofundme, any donation is appreciated no matter how small or generous. Thank you!

<TEXT> Hey all, I'm in a tough spot when it comes to money and I haven't found much support. I did set up a gofundme, and I got a little money on it from Facebook friends, but that money was really only a little. I'm in college full time, living on my own and I haven't been able to fully pay my rent for three months now and I owe a couple hundred to school. I'm really looking for some ideas to make some money. I tried getting a second job, but the combination of my school schedule and not having a car made that impossible. I recently got over a fight with depression, but I'm worried it's going to come back. Any ideas are welcome, but be serious! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't know who Andre Ellington was at the beginning of the year. I tend to only care about the players from the team I support or whoever is on my fantasy team. I didn't know he was a beast. My team auto drafted him. I said "who is this guy?" So I traded him. Now I see him doing great and it's like watching a fat ex girlfriend look beautiful and not fat with Leo DiCaprio. I see these stats he puts up and I feel like I'm dying a little bit. I'm 3-5 (3 game winning streak though!) and his owner is 8-0. I'm a normal title contender in this league and I know that if I kept him my team would be in a better position. Mr.Ellington I beg for your forgiveness. Forgive me for my naiveness and impatience. I will live the rest of my life indebted to you if you allow me to make the playoffs in this league. Please, Mr. Ellington. Thank you Red Jesus.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I got home from school a few hours ago (I go to community college). I live with two roommates who love to eat my food. I was expecting to make the rest of my spaghetti last until Thursday because I get paid Friday. It was gone when I got home. I get headaches when I'm hungry and they make it really difficult to study and do any work. 
I had to walk home too because I forgot my bus money at home ($1.50 and it's like a 50 minute walk). All I have left is some bread now, but there's a couple pieces left and that won't get me too far.
If someone buys me a nice pizza I'll post it with me smiling and then I will write you an appreciative poem!

One of my friends in my league was telling me that he would get these trade offers of Steven Ridley and Torrey Smith for Calvin Johnson (after his week 1 performance). Oh, Doug Martin, Vincent Jackson and MoJo for Peyton is a trade that happened. Sproles, Kelvin Benjamin, T.Y Hilton and Lamar Miller for Frank Gore and Randall Cobb also happened. Those 3 trades that happened involved the same kid. He's traded away Thomas, Manning, Gore and Cobb in 2 weeks.

<TEXT> I haven't been able to pay my rent for the last few months and for me that is extraordinarily far behind. I'm supposed to be getting money from a car accident case sometime in 2015, but my landlord isn't having it. The money I get from work goes to food and transportation to work/school. I'm 20 years old and I will have no where to turn. My dad lives in Florida (I'm in Connecticut) and we don't talk. My sisters and mom all live together and don't have room for me. I've had to change my life plans recently to try to accommodate me as I am right now, but I might have to change them drastically if I don't get any help soon. I set up a gofundme and a few friends have put some money in. http://www.gofundme.com/fdjd8c is the link to that. I've sold everything I have of value aside from my clothes, phone and laptop. I've tried getting a second job and have been trying for a few months now. If you want more details about how my life is almost ruined you can ask me. Thanks for anything. http://www.gofundme.com/fdjd8c </TEXT>

<TITLE> Stressed and broke College student needs help </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-03 16:51:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm going to a local community college and living in my own. My mom is broke and actually asks me for money sometimes. The thing is I'm broke too. I had a nice summer job until I was in a car crash, then a month later I spiraled into a stress fueled depression. I've seen a therapist and I've gotten better, but the stress and anxiety is still taking it's toll. I missed work because of that depression and car crash. I fell behind on bills. I couldn't work at that job anymore. I have a new job now and I'm looking for a second. I owe my landlord 
Nearly 1k and my school 230 before I can apply for the spring semester. I missed school full time last year (would've been my sophomore year) because I was stressing out over life. I'm scared it's happening again and I don't want to get stuck in a life without education. I should get money from the car crash in mid-late 2015, maybe later. Any amount of money will help out. I just desperately want to give my land lord some money and be able to pay back my college. If you need any verification I can provide it. Thank you so much. 

Edit: I just set up a gofundme

<TEXT> So I made a mistake with my bank account and now I'm $35 poorer than I was and it put me in the negative. I'm in college and I'm used to going until the last dollar is up, but when there's no money what is there to do. I live off campus by myself and I have enough chicken for 2 meals. I would like to save those for Tuesday and Wednesday. Thursday I'm fine - I go out Thursday night after class and one friend pays for us all and I've negotiated switching weeks with him. I was hoping someone could spot me a pizza tonight. Once I get paid I'll go back on here and buy someone pizza. It's only the right thing to do. Thank you! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Weird dream with a lot happening in it </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-24 18:10:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Some friends and I were having lunch or dinner on a rainy day at my favorite chain restaurant when suddenly I heard an explosion and a few screams. I looked outside the window and saw some smoke and then heard more explosions and off in the distance I saw a lot of smoke coming from an old factory in the distance with tall smokestacks. The smoke was coming from the building itself and not the smokestacks. More explosions came and suddenly the smokestacks began to crumble down and then it was clear what was causing this. Oddly enough it seemed like fireworks were going off and there were so many of them that it was doing serious damage to this building. Sooner than later the while building was reduced to rubble and the fireworks stopped. After this we left the restaurant and I went to a house where these three girls were. I only recognized the face of one of the girls, but she was the only person of significance in this part of the dream. It was clear that she was interested in making sexual advances with me, but I wasn't taking advantage of them even though in real life I find this girl really attractive. 


I've never had a dream like this where so much happened and I was hoping someone could interpret this or help with an interpretation. I really don't even dream that often - maybe once a month.  A lot of what I think are minuscule details were left out, but if you have any questions let me know! Thank you.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been feeling awfully shitty whenever I'm alone or not with people I know. This feeling started at work about 2 months ago and once in awhile I would find myself really in the dumps outside of work, but not too often. The longer time went on I would feel worse and worse outside of work. The last 3 weeks or so it's become so prominent in my life the only time I escape it is when I'm with friends. Even then I get an occasional feeling of hate for myself. I've been getting about 3 headaches a day the past week and I haven't been sleeping well. I've had a shitty appetite and I'm starting to hate everything about myself. It was suggested to me by my HR that I take some time off to try to clear my head. Tomorrow is my first day back in two weeks. Things haven't gotten better and I'm always alone at work. I'm scared to go back. I don't want to. We have a point system there and if you get to 10 you're fired. Work was a trigger for me so I've collected either 8, 9 or 10 in the last 2 months or so. I forgot how many I had so I could be getting fired when I come in tomorrow. I need money and I've applied to new jobs already just in case, but I know if I get fired it will be the most bittersweet thing in my life right now. I would've gotten rid of a large stressor in my life, but I would not have enough money. I'm 20, live with two roommates and go to school. My family is poor and I know they would struggle to support me if I didn't have a job. I have my own bills to pay and I'm really going to be screwed for a bit. All of my friends with the exception of 4 are away for school now and ude to school I won't have much time to see them. I'm scared things are going to get worse and my feelings will only escalate into something that could be troubling. I was recently rejected by this girl that I've still been friends with and tonight a friend went to a fair with her. When I asked that friend what he was doing earlier in the day (I wanted to hang out) he said he just wanted to stay at home tonight. I found out because the girl I like told me that they were going to the fair. That made me feel really shitty. My Mom's birthday was a couple of days ago and I forgot to at least call her. I felt like I was worthless for forgetting. It was 6pm and she texted me and she had to tell me it was her birthday. I really didn't want to live anymore after that text. I'm scared I'm becoming a huge failure and disappointment to myself. I want something bad to happen to me so I die. I know I wouldn't be able to take my own life from myself, but I don't think I would hesitate to try to save myself from anything bad happening to me. I don't see the point in living if I'm just going to feel shitty and scared all the time. I'm becoming extremely irritable, I find myself being quick to judge and then hate other people. I'm becoming an extremely bitter and pessimistic person. I'm seeing a therapist once a week now. I need that to help me. I need a lot right now. 

TL;DR My life feels like a waste, I think I'm becoming a fuck up and I'm scared of my future.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Broke down while brushing my teeth </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-23 12:09:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I actually got sent home from my job yesterday because I just felt myself on the verge of breaking down while there and I just couldn't work and I nearly broke down speaking to my manager. The last month and a half or so at work my performance has dropped rapidly without me realizing it and at the same time I've been feeling worse and worse about myself while working. I loved this job and now I just can't focus on doing it. My family has a history of behavioral health problems and that causes my anxiety to increase just by thinking about it. It also doesn't help that this amazing girl I had been talking to suddenly isn't interested even after she basically said she was. 

So today I got up feeling alright about myself and I just go brush my teeth and I just start crying my eyes out. I had been feeling really crappy about myself the last month or so except when I'm around others and I think this rejection was the tipping point. I always think about suicide even when I'm not feeling down on myself, but the past month and half I've thought about it more and more and the last two days it's been all over my mind. I'm usually able to shake off these feelings of despair, but I really don't see any hope in the future and I'm not sure if I want to.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So this girl I've had a crush on for a whole now recently broke up with her boyfriend about two weeks ago. I've hung out with her a few times since and I'm really getting interested in her. I'm 20 and I'm really awkward when it comes to these situations so I'm not sure how to handle it. I definitely want her to know I'm interested and I've tried to by giving her compliments (not too many), but I really don't want to come on too strong since I've heard her say to her friends she doesn't want to rush into a relationship. I know she doesn't think I'm bad looking and at least as good looking as her ex and we get along great. Ask any questions you all need, I'm appreciative of any help I can get.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Healthcare workers get infected because they aren't always trained up to first world standards in Africa. Some of the doctors are great over there some of them aren't. Ebola patients require 24/7 monitoring and are often stressful patients to work with. A lot of them get sick because they don't always properly clean rooms or isolate patients. If this were a flu you should be slightly worried. Ebola is held to mainly villages and quite frankly village people can't afford to fly over to the US or any first world nation. I wouldn't even be worried if I was working in Penn station. Now my knowledge of this is limited to my schooling. I'm going to school hoping to work for the CDC when I graduate so I only know this from what I've read and learned. I have 0 hands on experience with ebola. It does sound like an experimental cure has been very successful down in Atlanta. Avoid bodily fluids and you will be fine. What I've learned is to get people educated on the disease they're worried about and get them away from ignorance. Ebola isn't a big risk. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is a very little chance it would. It isn't a respiratory illness so there's a very small chance of that. If there is blood in the sneeze, it's a little higher of a chance if the blood touches you. I wouldn't worry about a sneeze. If someone pisses on you, shits on you, bleeds on you or vomits on you be worried. It really only spreads to family members, village members and health care workers. If you see anyone who looks like they have the flu, avoid them. Which I think is just common sense. Ebola starts off with flu like symptoms, then progresses rapidly. Don't worry about ebola unless you've come into contact with someone from west Africa or someone who just came from west Africa if they are sick. Very little reason to be worried. I cannot stress that enough. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The way it spreads shouldn't worry someone unless you eat bushmeat or are directly caring for someone with ebola. It doesn't spread easily. It's spreading because family members try to care for those infected with ebola. It wouldn't spread much in a developed country. You should only worry about your safety if you're dealing with a sick person who just came from west Africa or was in contact with someone from west Africa. Even if you don't live in a very developed country you shouldn't worry about it. Avoid those who are sick and throwing up. Don't touch urine, blood, saliva, feces and other bodily fluids that aren't your own. There really is no reason to panic about ebola. A flu panic is something that's reasonable in a developed nation. Ebola is not.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ebola Zaire which isn't responsible for this outbreak kills 90%. This one is 60-70% which is still nasty. A lot of people are freaking out because of how fast it is spreading for an ebola outbreak and how long it is lasting. People jump to ill-advised conclusions that it might be airborne now, but it's surely not. The outbreak would be larger than it is now. This outbreak is spreading at this rate and for this long because it isn't killing that quickly for an ebola strain so more people can come into contact with an infected person. No need to panic if you're in a wealthy country or outside of Africa. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You shouldn't worry about getting ebola unless you plan on coming in contact with a sick individual's bodily fluids. This ebola strain is very similar to the Ebola Zaire which means it is very unlikely it's airborne. This strain is spreading faster because it is killing a smaller number of people than the Zaire strain. I believe the Zaire strain killed 90% of infected, this one is killing roughly 65% of infected. 
Unless it becomes airborne don't worry. 
If for any reason you believe you could be sick, stay hydrated and see a medical professional.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exactly this. Vaccine companies wouldn't make enough profit considering all the work that would need to be done. Sadly creating a vaccine is only going to happen if profits will be made. The big buyers are going to be from first world nations and quite frankly, ebola poses little risk in those nations at the moment. The demand is simply too little for who is going to be able to buy it. Vaccine creation would take some time also. It doesn't exactly happen overnight.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> DUDE SAME! Except I did mine in 10th grade. It's exciting. It's almost an adrenaline rush when I see these updates. It's like a movie with real consequences. It hurts to think that people suffer mightily from ebola, but we must understand suffering is something that happens. I've read books on infectious disease since I was like 13 and I want to try to do work for the CDC when I finish my education. I don't really want to see this become a huge pandemic, but the thought of living through one is exhilarating. If it spreads worldwide I pray everyone to have the best luck. Maybe better sanitary conditions can prevent it in western countries, but maybe they won't. We don't really know how powerful ebola could be. We might be on the brink of witnessing it's potential.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It sounds like someone who isn't into bisexual girls. I mean take what you want from it, but it's me. My profile said something similar to "I'm intimidated by bisexual girls." I got rid of it, but I never once said I'm not scared of anyone who has had homosexual relationships. Me saying I'm intimidated is my way of saying I would be nervous to be with a girl who has been with other girls. If you want to be uptight and get offended by this then so be it. Saying that just because I have my profile set to straight girls only is a sign I may have other "illogical beliefs" is the most ridiculous thing I've heard in a while. Why don't you bring this up with okcupid who has that setting allowed? Do something constructive with how you feel instead of targeting one person. That's the problem with a lot of people these days. So many would rather harass someone over something silly than actually do something about it.  </TEXT>
