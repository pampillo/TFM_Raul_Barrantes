And I have a much more whimsical song, much like the one you said you'd prefer to hear, that was somewhat inspired by Shaco but it's only about 30 seconds long. I can upload it to YouTube for you if you'd like to hear it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know that feel. 
When you're stuck against a wall and by yourself, you're nothing more than a snack to a much larger ball, but then some idiot who has no ability to perceive size comes over to try and eat you, even though he's essentially the exact same size as you and has no hope of eating you. This making you seem like less of a snack and more of a delicious 2 course meal for the large ball floating right above you who now decides you're worth splitting for because this other dumb ass who came over and made you look more worthwhile. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The fact that there are lobbies dedicated to both playing as a team and playing as a singular entity would suggest the idea that the developers did mean for the concepts I'm arguing for to be the appropriate terms of playing. 

There are a ton of factors to count in, seeing as it's a new game that is exponentially growing in popularity, so accounting for all current and foreseeable issues in the game is going to be near a impossible task. So referring to the mechanics of the game, such as the "w" feature would make for an unstable ground to stand on as changes everyone can safely assume that the game is going to undertake several changes in the near future. That, and the W feature is both a weapon and a tool that can be used to ally. 

I do agree that temporary alliances are by all means justified as a means to overthrow someone of larger power, but you can't deny that permanent alliances, be they founded in the game, or premeditated (the $ clan comes to mind) do make for a pretty unfair and hardly enjoyable experience for the rest of us who are trying to play the way the lobby dictates we should. 

That's where my original point comes back. If you want to form bonds and work as a team to overthrow larger targets, then play in the team lobby where players are expecting that kind of imbalance. Leave the free for all lobby to the people who are trying to survive by themselves by whatever means they can.

<TEXT> So it's just for the novelty of acquiring friends in an unlikely environment? I appreciate the kind of satisfaction you must find from that, but it can still be argued that it's immoral to purposefully team up with someone in a game lobby where players are explicitly deciding to play every man for themselves.
It's the classic "my needs are greater than your needs" complex, but the satisfaction of the few "unfair" players hardly outweighs the satisfaction the players who are being cheated out of the game style their suggested.  </TEXT>

Why don't you just play teams instead? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Go play teams. That's what it's there for.
It makes the game so frustrating to be swallowed by people who just team up on you and feed each other when necessary.

Also, I can't be the only person who specifically targets players with the name "Team? = W" can I? </TEXT>

What started off as a project inspired by Shaco, eventually lead into a piece of music I used for a university performance.

<TEXT> Hi, Foxdrop.
I'm a Shaco main, and seeing your opinion in the comments about how Shaco will receive an implied buff to his early counter jungling is very nice to see. 
My question is, what, in your opinion, would you say is the best jungle item to build for Shaco? At first glance I thought it would be the one that marks an enemy, but I'm not sure if that would break his stealth, which removes his crit damage. </TEXT>
