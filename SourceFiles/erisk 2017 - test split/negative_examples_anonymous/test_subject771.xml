<TEXT> I've actually rolled a car when I was 14.  Valentine's day, 1998 to be specific.  Icy roads, and my dad was too drunk to drive, so I did.  I rolled a 1972 Toyota Corona.  Ever had to roll down the window to roll it up, and shove a 330 lb man off of you because he didn't wear a seat belt?  I have.  I won't drive anything anywhere if people aren't belted in.  

I don't care if I'm in ID.  No seatbelt = me no drive.  I'll turn off the car and put it in neutrual.  It's amazing how strong a 95 lb 14 year old kid is in a life threatening situation. (a 330 lb man who is my dad is laying on top of me, pick him up and throw him to the passenger side).  take off the seat belt, and fall down to the roof.  Then the mile long walk to the ranch house, "grandpa, I had a wreck, the cars upside down, and my dad is stuck inside".  That was a great year, 98.  Best year ever.  I wish I could re-live 02/14/98 every day.  NOT.  

We were supposed to have lobster that day.  Didn't happen.  My dad got his ass kicked by my grandpa, and I had to drive the now fucked up car home.  Fun times.  NOT.  I drove to town later that night and picked up papa murphy's, because the lobster went bad.  I haven't went on that road since. </TEXT>

<TEXT> OK, then why did when I hit whatever the hell I it at 50 in the ditch feel like I just punched in the chest by Hulk Hogan, (yeah, I used to watch wrestling a lot).  and why did it trap me until I figuured out to relax my chest and then the seat belt went slack?  50-0 in a couple of milliseconds is fun.

<TEXT> I didn't notice any give when I was a dumbass 19 year old kid driving down the road trying to read my mail.  One second, on the road, the next, 20 feet down, and desperatly trying to stop, (and couldn't because I was literally in the water and going 50), , and then hit something under water so hard that it sunk my stereo reciever in my dash by a foot, and almost got hit in the head by by sub, (unsecure load).  I almost shot out my rear window until I realized "hey what If I try and roll down my driver window?.  It worked, so I crawled out.  I had my .45LC lined up and was about ready to shoot until I remembered "try rolling down the window before shooting".  That saved me about $710 of glass damage.  I had my finger on the trigger and was about ready to squeeze off a round.  I thought I was trapped because my doors wouldn't open.  That sudden stop, (still don't know what I hit underwater when I was in that ditch even 12 years later, but that sudden stop hurt like hell). </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's why the HANS restraining device is mandantory in NASCAR and NHRA racing.  Don't have it?  Simple solution.  You're not on the track.  Dale Earnhardt's death made it mandatory in NASCAR.  I remember that wreck on the final lap of the 2001 Daytona 500 very well.  I broke the news to my dad that "Earnhardt is dead!". :(  We never watched NASCAR again together again.  I tried back in 2007, but it just wasn't the same without "The Intimidator".  Haven't bothered watching it since.  I used to keep a race schedule 2 years in advance.  It used to be our "church".  Now, I have no idea when the next race is besides "sunday?" </TEXT>

<TEXT> In WA, it says I either have to have a windshield, or wear goggles.  (understandable).  Legally, there's nothing stopping me from chopping off the entire top of my truck off, and driving it down the road with a pair of ski goggles on.  (no, I'm not doing that, I've already drove with a failed heating fan, and that was cold enough to freeze up the inside of the windshield so I had to put on my shades and hang out the window at 60 to see where the hell I was going).

Good point about the noise ordinances. :)  I completly forgot about that. :)  I rebuilt my father's 93 Geo Metro back in 2001, and decided "fuck the exhaust, and just ran a straight pipe.  He got a warning about 121 dB :D  I put on a muffler. :D I didn't bother with the cat since no emissions control around here.  (why I put on a glass pack on a Metro?  because I had an extra one, so why not?)  It met noise ordinances. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> OK, assuming the DMV approved it, and gave me registration, what would a cop do if I got pulled over for I don't know, taking an improper right turn? but when stopped, and he looked in, I was strapped in like I'm on the track, and was wearing a full helmet, a 5pt restraining device, and had a HANS restraining device strapping my head in to I didn't snap my neck in case I did a Dale Earnhardt, and had to actually take off all of my saftey gear before I could even get access to the glove box to get my DL/Reg/Ins?  (No, I don't have like $250,000 to put into such an old truck, so this question is purely hypothetical).  For the sake of argument, noise ordinances don't exist, so I didn't get stopped for being as loud as a jet taking off. </TEXT>

<TEXT> OK, I did a lot of stupid shit to my rig when I was 16, (my door wouldn't lock shut one time, so I slammed it shut, and welded it closed).  I had to get out of my car NASCAR style for 2 years until I got into a head-on and kind of had to get rid of that rig because I ruined it).  But as a grown ass man, I know how to fix a door that won't latch shut, and I don't need a mig welder anymore.  :)  But good point.  Although the thought of duct tape never entered my mind to use for anything besides the air intake manifold, (and it worked).

Hmm, so what if I had endless money, and decided to convert my truck into a "race ready, street legal" truck, and got pulled over in a converted 1997 Blazer LT obviously purposly rebuilt for the track, but met legal requirements to be a legal road vehicle.  (hey, if people can ride horses on the street, why can't I legally drive my hypothetically converted truck down the road so long as I obey all laws?)  Let's say I met all NASCAR/NHRA requirements, but also had indicators, plates, lights, (and in some areas a muffler and cat)?  (and if I had endless money, there's no way in hell I would waste my time with my truck, I'd just build one). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've rolled a car when I was 14, and my dad wasn't wearing a seatbelt.  I was.  A 330lb man landed on a 95 lb child.  He was too drunk to drive, so I did.  It was Valentine's Day, 1997.  It's amazing how strong a 14 year old kid is when he's upside down and trapped.  After that incident, I refuse to move a vehicle unless everybody is belted in.  I literally picked him up off of me, and thew him back to the passenger side.  Then the mile long walk back to the ranch house.  That was fun.  NOT.  It was confusing enough getting out of a standard seat belt in a 1972 Toyota Corona, (after I shoved my dad off of me).  I had to crawl UP to the underbody of the car and get out.  and roll my window down, (which is now up), to climb out.  My granddad kicked my dad's ass because he was too drunk to drive, and had to pull us out with a D6.  Yes, the car still drove when righted, (but very shittily).  I had to drive home because my dad was drunk, and just got his ass kicked.

Good point about the fire though.  Had it caught on fire, I would have likely decided "fuck this!" and just ran.  Getting out of a 5pt restraint harness would have been almost impossible.  That's a good reason. </TEXT>

Ideally, spot welded so you can be **absolutely sure** it isn't going anywhere EVER.  So why don't NHRA and NHTSA have the same requirements for vehicles, (besides the fact nobody goes 150 on the highway)? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, but why?  I could get behind the wheel of the 51 ford (with no belts at all), and go 60MPH down the highway, (legal speed limit), if I wanted to, but I won't because I don't want to be road pizza.  I think a **minimum** of a 3 pt restraining harness should be mandatory, but if you want to strip your rig and make it a race vehicle, you should be allowed to, (so long as your street legal).  Why would they care if I gutted my truck, put in a roll bar, plexiglass shielding, welded my doors shut, put in a roll bar with cross members, put in a racing seat, and a 5 pt restraining harness with a HANS restraint device, and wore a helmet, and drove down the road?  (I mean besides the fact I'm taking a truck designed for the track out on the street).

<TEXT> They've had that page up for 3 years now.  It's just flat out wrong.  When I called the cable company earlier this year, I had a question about why in the 90's that I was able to pick up cable TV with my antenna if I pointed it SSE, and had a complete channel line up, and would it work now?"  (yes, it really did happen, I was able to pick up a cable system over 30 miles away if the conditions were right).

They said likely a signal leak from a neighbor, but "it won't work now because every device connected to the network must be authorized."  I know that statement is false, because my analog TV just works like it always has, and my HDTV works perfectly fine to pick up both analog and ClearQAM service.  I never registered my serials with them, and just plugged them into the wall.  Cable here works just as it always has.

I still haven't gotten a satisfactory answer to how come I was able to pick up a city over 30 miles away cable TV system on my antenna back in the 90's. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  [MS15-078](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/MS15-078) is the patch for a vulnerability in Microsoft font driver that could allow remote code execution.

The security bulletin stated:

This security update resolves a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted document or visits an untrusted webpage that contains embedded OpenType fonts. This security update is rated Critical for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows.

Under vulnerability information, Microsoft wrote:

OpenType Font Driver Vulnerability - CVE-2015-2426

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Windows when the Windows Adobe Type Manager Library improperly handles specially crafted OpenType fonts. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

There are multiple ways an attacker could exploit this vulnerability, such as by convincing a user to open a specially crafted document, or by convincing a user to visit an untrusted webpage that contains embedded OpenType fonts. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows Adobe Type Manager Library handles OpenType fonts.

When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had information to indicate that this vulnerability was public but did not have any information to indicate this vulnerability had been used to attack customers. Our analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They cannot tell what you are watching.  A TV is just a receiver, and does not transmit.  The only way they can tell if you are watching is if you have a cable company cable box.  You could watch it to your heart's content.  If caught, (doubtful), the most that will happen is they'll put a trap back on the line, and one day you'll come home and have either nothing on TV, or basic service (local broadcast channels), only.  

Then just wait a week, and go outside and take off the trap yourself, and you'll have all the channels again.  You can get a terminator removal tool on eBay for like $5, and a P-key is about $15.  The chances of getting caught are nil.

**EDIT:**  Just don't report a cable TV outage. ;) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because of the enormous weight of the towers, they have to be anchored to solid beddrock, or a large concrete slab with enough mass to prevent the tower from falling over in high winds.  After that part is done, it is built in a lattice structure, much like the core of a skyscraper is erected.  The diagonal struts add structural integrity to the tower, and make it more resistant to twisting in the wind, (or in event of an earthquake).  It is typically built from a wide base, to a narrow top where the transmission antennas are, and if extra stability is needed, guy wires are added to the tower, and angled out at a 45 degree angle for maximum torsion strength. </TEXT>

Why not shoot a radar beam directly in front of the vehicle so you know exactly how fast you're going?  It wouldn't cost any more to do the initial setup with a new vehicle.

My radar detector lets me know about speed traps, (duh), but when I see one of those speed limit signs with a speed indicator, I drive EXACTLY the speed, and pass it, then see how accurate I am.  Go figure, if I keep my tires to manufacturers rating, I'm under.  If I inflate to the max, I'm exactly accurate. O.o.  I don't get it. </TEXT>

When I grew up, Nick At Nite played Mr Ed, and now they air "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air", (it used to be on NBC at 1900 hrs). When I was a youth, TVLand didn't exist.  They now have a station called "Antenna TV".  I'm old enough to remember when that was the only way I could get TV.  I was living in a giant antenna, and got 2,3,4,6.7,10,12,22,24,28,35,40.  I wired my room to be a huge antenna.  One of my friends came over during the summer of 95, and saw my setup.  "Bad reception?" was her question.

That's it.  When I was halfway there, I don't remember much at all.  Other than I almost decided to fight the doctor because I thought he broke into my house.  I never thought I would get ID'ed by my dog tags, but I guss I was laying on my wallet.  Good thing I have them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wasn't trying to kill myself, and I don't think I'm fat and ugly because I'm fat, and if I only weigh less I'll be better looking.  I was just feeling like shit, so I didn't eat for a while, and then once a week passed and I was feeling OK again, I was waiting for the "I'm hungry" signal again to eat, but it never came.  Hence 19 days with no food, and ending up in the hospital for seizures.  

All my step mom, (that is basically my mother since she and my father raised me since I was 2), was "Why do you always have to learn things the the hardest way possible, I have tried to tell you numerous times about the importance of eating, but no, you had to go get yourself hospitalized for starvation."  That didn't make me feel very good.  Another friend besides the one who threatened to tell her mom told me that she has a room that I can move into and if she needs to treat me like one of her kids, she will. :(

I never realized how many people cared what I do, even if I did it completely unintentionally, and didn't intend on killing myself through starvation.  It's not like I intended on passing out in the middle of WM and being hauled off to the hospital.  My truck was still in the WM parking lot when I was discharged, and I left the windows down and the keys in the ignition.  Yes, my truck was still there, (but the interior was wet because it rained).  Thank dog my seats are leather, I was just able to wipe it off and sit down to drive it away.  

I don't think I have anorexia, but yes, I have 2 appointments with mental health professionals, an appointment with my physician, and now I have to take Keppra, and make an appointment with a neurologist because I had a seizure. :(  One good thing about Keppra, my hand tremors have stopped, and now I don't have dry heaves in the morning when I wake up, so it is doing some good. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, you get high out of your mind by a DMT dump as your brain is dying, then you have euphoric pleasure and everything is awesome, (or intriguing, or scary), and then you die.  Show me a person who has a flat EEG and EKG, and came back from the death, and I'll show you ET.  Medical proof needed.  Thier body must have assumed room temperature.  (complete death).  "Near death" is not "death".  I was "near death" when I collapsed because of starvation.  I didn't see shit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I felt like shit for a week, so I just didn't bother with it since I felt like if I ate, whatever went down would come up. Then after a week, I felt OK, and I wasn't hungry, so I just didn't eat. I figured I would eat when I felt hungry, (like I usually do). That hungry feeling just never came, so I didn't eat. Wrong decision. I had to get IV feed for a day because I physically could not eat for the first day. The second day, I tried eating, and tried to eat a cup of clam chowder, a small saucer of apple sauce and a soda. I couldn't finish it. The day of discharge, I was eating a normal sized meal for a 12 year old, (half a plate of spaghetti), but still got full. I still can't polish off a whole can of denty moore's beef stew. I can only eat about half of it.

Now my friends are pissed at me, and one is threatening to tell her mom who is a Viet Nam refugee because she outran that shit, and here I am "in the land of the plenty" doing it to myself.  She'd be pissed, and give me a first hand account of how bad it was there.  I've seen the documentaries, (I'd leave too on an inner tube), so I really don't want to hear a first hand account of it.  Her mom would be pissed, and would probably force feed me.

Go figure, now I can do exactly this with my cell phone, but long distance doesn't really exist anymore.  (well, TMO still has regional calling, and small regional carriers, but nobody else).  

I remember having to dial a code to roam, then turn off my phone for 15 min, then turn it back on.  Billed at $2.50/min to roam.  Then when entering your service area, you had to enter ANOTHER code, turn your phone off, and back on again, and now you're not roaming anymore, so it's only $1.00/min. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because in the "days of the landline phone", if you wanted to dial long distance out of your area code, you had to dial 1, (USA National Code), to signal that you need access to the national trunk to ATT.  The format was (011)+(country)+(area)+(phone).  So if you were in England, and wanted to call Moscow ID, it would be 011+1+208+882+4571.  But if you're in Colton WA, (since it is in the same country, it would just be 1+208+882+4571.  There also used to be other trunk codes such as 00 to relay by satellite. Cellular phones, (for domestic calls), automatically insert the 1, so you don't have to.  Remember station to station calls?  $2/min in the 90's.  Hell, I bet you're too young to remember long distance, and 10-10-xxx codes dialed before the number. :)

<TEXT> Muhammed was just trying to "spread the word" on God as he understood him.  It was his followeres that were the problem.  I don't remember where I read it, but they were very advanced for the time, and there was a proposal to build the the Suez Chanal almost 1600 years before it was actually built, and shut down because it would be a military risk if actually constructed.  The ME used to be the center of science and development, then the age of enlightenment happened, and Europe took over

<TEXT> If I held a pistol to your head, and you refused to convert, then you didn't, so I killed your family members while making you watch, wouldn't you convert?  Oh, and I'd leave behind one of my military escorts to make sure you didn't detract from the faith either.  Detraction = death to the rest of your family, and to you.  Conversion at the point of a sword is very persuasive.

<TEXT> I mean the poor people recruited get no tangible benefit.  I'm not talking about the charity cases reliant on the food bank, but just minimum wage workers that see a local church in town, and decide to go, and then the hat is passed around and you feel like a damned tool if you don't put at least a couple cents in the hat before passing it down the line.  

All for nothing that can't be proven.  (unless you can send cameras to the afterlife).  But there are more Christian denominations than passages in the bible.  Destitute people need the churches for charity works, and I understand it's an out reach program.  But the working poor don't need it.  I'd have no problem with charity drives, like standing in front of a store and passing out fliers that say "food for the needy, this is what we need" to every customer.  Hell, one day, I gave over $200 in food to a church that did exactly that.  (I had extra money that month, so what the hell).  They were kind of surprised when they asked "what's here for us", and I just said "The entire buggy". and walked off.  Somebody did it for me a long time ago when I was in need, so I did it for somebody else that I will never even meet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They are large gaseous objects that gather together under the force of gravitation and electromagnatism.  Then because of the heavy gravitational forces, they collapse upon themselves and form a star and planets.

They are destroyed by the collapse into a formation of several stars, (usually), and they drift away according to the spin that the underwent while the nuclear reaction went critical, and formed planets, and debris and shit.  They are made out of mostly hydrogen and helium, but also a few other elements going all the way down to uranium. </TEXT>

FTL is impossible as known to the laws of physics as we currently understand them, but if you can figure a way around it, you'll get to be a billionaire, and win the nobel prize.  

Hypothetically, if you could build a telescope the size of the Moon, and send it out 65M LY away, yes, you could watch the destruction of the dinosaurs.

Fun fact:  It takes about 1.25 seconds to contact the Moon one way, and 15 minutes to mars.  (speed of light is about 299,792,458 m/s)  If the sun burnt out right now, we wouldn't know for about 8 minutes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Davey Crocketts are tactile nuclear weapons low yeild. 100T payload.  Set it not to launch, and detonate on a timer, (much like an IED).  Have 4 vans parked in the garage, and one at each exit/entrence.  Blow them both at the same time. Total failure, and explosion.  Wait until noon for mass casualties 70,000 people per building.  Then blame it on some rouge terrorist group from somewhere.

That would work much better than a few dumbasses with box knifes flying airplanes into buildings.  Doing that would cause a complete massive uproar and a move to join the military, and kill whoever they blame it on unseen since forever.  If I wanted to stage a terrorist attack, it wouldn't be too hard as the President, and the effects would be long lasting.  EMP the USA. That would take about 2 days to plan, and cause hundreds of millions of people to die, and decades to fix.  This report was released the same day as the 9/11 commission report.  Yes, they were hiding something, but it wasn't 9/11.

http://www.empcommission.org/

**EDIT:**  It wouldn't even take a semi-automatic weapon to get mass casualties.  Just the stampede effect.  Get a couple dudes into the Superbowl with a string of firecrackers, and shoot off 1 round each from each position.  Set off the strings, and shoot one random person.  Stampede effect, and then the media could blame "maniacs with machine guns" for the thousands of people being stomped to death, when what? 4 people are killed because of hostile action?

That's how to terrorize a population.  Can you imagine that reaction?  Not only several thousand people being injured/killed because of the stampede effect, but also millions of people watching on TV live?  That's the way to do it.  Even if I was planning a terrorist plot, I can think of better shit than 9/11 to do.  The airplanes would only be the start.  Then the car bombs go off at every entrance, then the parking garage bombs would go off, and set trains to explode when the pass under it. 9/11 was run by somebody that didn't know what he was doing. </TEXT>

I'd do it to, and they had reason to be shot down.

Building 7 fell down because of the massive fires that were raging in the tower for over 12 hours, and when I think they said "pull it", they were referring to "let it burn and get the hell out".  I didn't see any cranes that day, and it takes several weeks to set up a demo team..  Ever heard of the think known as "collateral damage" from shrapnil?  Shit happens man.

3. Nope.  I just think that the 9/11 people are full of shit.

4.  I wish.

5.  No, I'm not a racist, (by definition, segregation of a group of people based on external appearances or color is racist).

6. No, I do investigation, but I don't believe in fake moon landings, lizard people, 9/11 being operation northwoods in practice, or the Regan fake murder, or all the school shootings were faked by liberals, or that bill clinton was in contact with the mafia, or other bullshit shit.

7. You do have a lot of shit that is worth considering.  I do believe in restricted areas around nuclear power plants, (I've kind of been chased out of one), I believe in Area 51 because I can find it on Google Maps, I think more than one man was behind JFK, (but who), and that if JFK would't have gotten into a pissing contest with the russians, he wouldn't have "saved us" from the missile crisis, and that clinton started Kosovo on purpose to distract from the lewinsky thing).  I think I'm the first one to think up the last two, but I think it's true.  United 93 was shot down by the USAF.  Just listen to the tapes.  That's all you have to do.  Who is that executive aircraft?  It's the USAF. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Blind luck I guess.  I only shoot fireworks off holding them because my dad did, and he survived fine.  Roman candles have a kick, but as long as you keep it well away from your head, it's fine.  Powder burns from bottle rockets are painful, but the rockets are fucking painful. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, I did, believe me.  My right hand still hurts, and I'm lucky I didn't lose it.  A mortar exploded on me (twice), a bottle rocket had a FTL, and just blew up on me, and I had a premature detonation on a firecracker.  I think I'm explosived out for the next year.  Oh, a roman candle kind of blew up on me too.  I dove for the nearest cover, (a parking berm), and got missed by what looked like an inch.  It's amazing how slow detonations are when you're running for your very life after yelling "FIRE IN THE HOLE!  RUN NOW! and running yourself.I made it 5ft before I had to jump behind the nearest thing for safety.  I'm lucky I'm alive after tonight's escapades. </TEXT>

I'm sure the people didn't like it much seeing my pillock and pounding on thier door to let them know "WE HAVE INCOMING!"  He came out with me, and listened to the siren and announcements.  He just said, "It's a drill you dingus.  Go put some pants on."  I was relieved and embarrassed at the same time.  I know where the evacuation site is if it ever does come.

<TEXT> I tied in psychology, but they don't allow test posts.

My ex wife thinks I should tell my counselor, but I don't know.  I don't want to start any shit over shit that doesn't need to be started.  Should I do like she always said, and just keep my mouth shut?  I really don't want to get her in trouble, because it's been 14 years now.  I should have gotten over it, but my ex wife thinks I still act like a beaten child just trying to stay alive.


I've gotten in contact with my ex-GF from HS, and my ex wife deosn't think it's healthy, and I"ve reverted to a battered child again since contacting her, because I seem to cower when confronted with any conflict, and try and back out anyway that I can.  (well, back in 2012, I literally picked a guy up, and threw him out on the street to end a knife fight, but I only did it because I thought I had to.  It was either that or shoot him).

I think that's just dumb because I'm armed to the teeth, and have several ways to end a threat if I really need to.  I can shoot, I can fight with my knife, I can pole fight, and I can fist fight if I must.  Ideally, I'll never have to do any of it, but I can if I must. </TEXT>

I tried in 2010, but it just wasn't the same.  One of the best drivers in history got killed, all because of a $140 piece of equipment, (HANS restraining device).  Now I don't want to race at all.  I guess she accomplished her goal.  I had a "need for speed", now I don't.  Pretty morbid video to watch, but better than a "serious discussion". </TEXT>

<TEXT> I broke the news to my dad that day, "Earnhardt is dead!". He didn't believe me until he came into my room and watched the broadcast. He was crying. We never watched NASCAR again I remember that day well. He said "what?" I said "Earnhardt?" he said "yeah?" I said " IS DEAD". We walked back to my room, and I still had the TV on, and he watched for about a minute, sat down on my bed, and just started crying. I tried in 2010, but it's just not the same. One of the best drivers ever got killed, and I can't watch it anymore. </TEXT>

I sort of chickened out after seeing that, and I only had a 10M wait until I was "next up".  Seeing a giant fireball 20M in front of me kind of made me put it into drive and leave the track.

<TEXT> I was on acid, but my end table turning into this strange machine that had gears and pulleys, and wheels and belts, and ramps and belts, and there were a bunch of 2" tall people running around making this machine work.  I couldn't figure out what the hell they were making, or what the machine was supposed to do, but it was the coolest thing I ever saw.  LSD is a hell of a drug, and you can see some amazing shit that is mind boggling.

**EDIT:**  I couldn't figure out what the hell they were doing, but I didn't try to engage and just watched it trying to figure out what the hell they were doing.  Whatever those mini-people were doing, they looked busy, so I didn't want to disturb them.  I had this thought of "Woah, what if this is how power really works?" and was looking for wires, but couldn't find any.  Since I couldn't figure out what the hell they were doing, I just watched. 20m later *poof* gone.  Then I decided to walk outside, and I "felt the gas station".  That was the coolest thing I ever felt. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was up at Stateline about 10 years ago, and they let you race if you have a seatbelt, (or not if your rig was made before 63 or so), and have a $10 bill for admittance for an hour.  I just called the LC airport to see if they'll let me use a runway for an afternoon. :)  That's really the only option I have if I want to keep it off the streets.  I got that idea from Top Gear.  They race on aeroport tarmac, so maybe I can too?  IDFK?  Worth a shot though.

I saw a jetcar explode, and a stock car race.  Watching a high speed collision live is a hell of a lot different than on TV.  I saw that car flip 5 times and land on it's wheels.  The crowd was silent as a grave.  I wanted to see cars go fast, not have a wreck and get towed out after the EMT's and the fire truck came out and made sure the dude was alive.  O.o  I didn't have enough balls to get on the track after seeing that.

**EDIT:**  And now you know why I get into street drags on occasion, but after seeing a couple of videos on this forum, I don't want to do that anymore because even if I was Dale Earnhardt, shit happens.  I remember that race too.  I want to keep it off of the street. </TEXT>

* Keep your car locked, most thefts are opprotunistic crimes.

* Take your keys with you, and roll up your windows.  I never took a rig without easy access to it.  (1998 camaros haul ass BTW)

* Make sure you have a secondary ignition interlock, even if they have a screwdriver and a a hammer, it's not going to do much good if they can't find the secondary ignition switch.

* Surprisingly enough, a push button and a ignition toggle lever.  Most thieves (well kids), want to have a good time, and not jack your rig.  They won't be able to figure it out, and will leave you alone even if they do gain access.

* keep your rig clean on the interior.  Messy car = easy target.  Nobody's really going to notice if I'm driving a broken down ford that looks like a rolling trash can with a broken ignition switch. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes they were.  They were also the first to institute the draft, and print "greenbacks" backed up by nothing, and to institute an income tax to fund the war effort, and rationing of goods to the civilian population.  They also had such a strict "defend the homeland" policy, that they rarely left their "territory".  Had they firebombed DC, they likely could have forced the north to come to terms of peace.  Sherman later did that to Atlanta in 1864-1865 during his "march to the sea".  

Preemptive strikes work, when done correctly.  Imagine the Union's reaction to WDC, NYC, Boston, and Phillidephia being razed to the ground.  It would have been humiliating to the northern efforts to contain the rebels, and likely would have worked. </TEXT>

I wouldn't fly that flag, any more than I would fly the flag of the USSR.  It's gone folks.  At least the USSR existed for about 75 years.  The CSA was just piss in a windstorm.  When I see the confederate flag, I don't associate it with racism, I associate it with "somebody's mad that they lost".  Fuck, might as well flag of Yugoslavia for what the CSA flag represents. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think I would rather just get my ass kicked than live with an eternity with .... literally nothing.  If I had my "bat belt" as my ex wife called it, I'd just pull out my gun and end it.  And it would be different than just not existing, because you're conscious the whole time and you can think of every waking moment.  Imagine looking out to see .... nothing. but you're fully conscious of it.  I'd be begging for my sidearm at that point, and I would only need 1 round.

**EDIT:**  You would go insane.  Look up sensory deprivation.  Most people can last about 72 hours from what I've researched.  I don't mean lock up, I mean total sensory deprivation.  That is the ultimate form of torture.  At least I've practiced for sucking dick by deep throating hot dogs.

Everything ceases to exist outside of quantum particles, but you continue to live  .... forever ... with nothing to see or experience, or do.  Imagine being locked in your room as a kid when getting punished with no TV or radio or power.  Now make it last forever.  But there's no bed to lay in and cry, no walls, no floor.  Just nothing, and ... more of nothing.  Then it never ends  because it's .... forever.  Terrifying prospect to be left alone for ever with literally nothing but your thoughts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can you imagine that?  "The Last Perfect Day", and then it gets hotter, the sun gets brighter, and then it becomes insufferably hot, and then all of the organic matter around you starts wilting and dying off, then spontaneous combustion becomes a very real thing, then the world literally catches fire., then the atmosphere is blown off into space, and all of the water on the planet.  Plate techtonics break down because the surface is molten, and the planet it turned into a ball of molten rock, and then completly engulfed by the Sun, and vaporised.  

The only trace of the Earth left would be a slightly higher iron and sulphur and sodium content in the sun.  Then the sun collapses, and earth is gone forever, (and venus and mercury).  Mars would likely survive as a burnt out husk like mercury is today, and the rest of the planets would be unaffected.  I think I would rather just shoot myself. </TEXT>

Living to see everything you ever known, cared about, and ever seen, just engulfed and obliterated by the dying sun?

How about in a googolplex years, when the very atomic structure of the Universe ceases to exist.  Not even electrons would exist, and the only thing existing would be some photons, some quantum particles and you?  Alone, forever, in a universe with nothing, and you still live on.

<TEXT> We all die.  Shit happens.  It's unavoidable.  It's nothing to be feared, after I die, I won't even exist, so why fear what I can't feel, sense, taste, or touch?  Might as well feat the Space Jews stealing all the moon money.  It just makes no sense to fear death.  Hell, my house could collapse on me right now and crush me under a couple of hundreds of tonnes right now.  The USSR could launch now, and vaporise me in 45m.  Why fear what I can't control?

To put a reverse on an old country song, it's not the thought of being dead, it's the thought of dying that is sort of frightening.  If the soviets launch, well, I won't feel a damned thing.  I'll just be non-existent one millisecond.  If my house collapses for some reason, I might be trapped for several days before expiring.  I think I would rather die in a thermonuclear explosion. </TEXT>

A black man walks into the sheriff's office to register to vote in Alabama.  He goes to pass the literacy test.

The Sheriff says "Can I help you son?"

The black man says "Yes sir, I came to pass my literacy test to vote."

The sheriff hands him a newspaper in Chinese, and asks the black man "Can you read that?"

The black man looks at the paper and sadly states, "Yes sir, I can.  It says here that "No niggers going to vote in this county."  He turns and walks out the door after setting down the paper on the sheriff's desk. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Correct.  WWII would have likely never happened.  (or at around 1960 between the USSR and USA, but it would have been conventional since the atomic bomb would have not been developed in this ATL).  But if the USA remained COMPLETELY neutral in WWI, both the USA and USSR would have likely remained isolationist, so we might still be referring to WWI as "The Great War".

<TEXT> Wouldn't work.  What if the passenger needs to make a call?  What if, like in 1998 when I was coming up the lewiston hill, somebody coming the other way down flashes his lights at you because you think there is a cop ahead, so you slow down; then you come around a corner and A VEHICLE IS HEADING RIGHT FOR YOU ON A DIVIDED HIGHWAY! 

I cut off a semi, and picked up on my phone, and called 911 to let them know about it, then got on my CB (chan 9), and let "ALL HEADING SOUTHBOUND ON US 95!  ALL HEADING SOUTHBOUND ON US 95!  THERE IS A LARGE VEHICLE HEADING NORTH IN THE SOUTHBOUND LANES ON THE LEWISTON HILL!  I REPEAT!  THERE IS A LARGE VEHICLE HEADING IN THE SOUTHBOUND LANES TO NORTH!  DIVIDED HIGHWAY!!"  

Within 10s of my call, I could hear the sirens behind me.  That was a legitimate emergency, so you bet your fucking ass I'm using my phone and CB!

Yes, I missed him by less that 30 feet.  That was fucking scary.  Had it not been for my phone and radio, who knows how large that accident would have been.  Technologically prohibiting cell phone use in a moving vehicle isn't a solution, education is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I came across it, and I had to turn it off.  My wife was texting and driving with me in the car.  If she was my daughter, I would have taken her damned phone and thrown it out the window.  I made my wife watch it.  She went white at the head on scene, and started crying at the kid asking mommy and daddy to wake up, and almost puked at the dead baby scene.  I'm thinking about taking her to a wrecking yard and seeing in person what happens when you text and drive.  Somebody in HS did that to me when she heard I was racing on busy public streets.  I got drug out to her truck, and she forced me to actually open up the vehicle and take a look inside.  She then shoved my head in and "smell that?  That's death.  That's what you're causing by racing on US195!  Keep up what you're doing, and you're going to be smelling this!  You will be the cause! This vehicle was going 131 on US195!  Do you want to see who they hit?"  All I could say was "no." and sounded like a child that just got beat by his mom.  I was crying at that point, and she drug me back to her truck and we went back to school.  I never raced on the highway again.  (I'll race on empty ones, but not that one, it's just too busy, and I might kill somebody).  There's nothing like the smell of curdled blood and some hair and skull to remind you DON'T RACE ON OPEN ROADS!.  I got hit after she heard about that, and I deserved it.

**TL;DR:** DON'T RACE!  DON'T TEXT AND DRIVE! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like I was her own kid.  She was raising me since I was 2yo, and I would rather run to my step mom than my birth mom for help.  My sister and I were the only kids "she ever had".  She got pregnant in 1998 because she wanted a "kid of her own", but changed her mind 6 weeks into it, because "I already have kids".  

My birth mother is fucking useless, but my step mom stepped in several times in grade school and raised hell because I was coming home with marks on me.  She told my dad to stop sending me over to joe's house because he would beat me.  My step mom basically **WAS** my mother, and did all of the things moms do, and dad did what dads do.  

My birth-mother was a negligent parent, and had no reason to even have me for once a week until I was 7.  Although I call her by her first name, she's "mom" to me.  There are billions of people called "mom", or "mum", but only one XXXXX in my mind.  So I call her by her first name, (and have all my life), as a sign of respect.  She only slapped me twice. </TEXT>

I just want a date with a movie and dinner, pretend to enjoy my company is all I ask, not a blowjob or a handjob.  Does this look like the plot of FMJ?!  $150/hr lady.  Take it or leave it!"

**edit:**  For that much money, I would pretend to be gay, but the most "sexual contact" that would ever ever happen is holding hands, and even then I'm wearing sun glasses so I can't easily be IDed as a "queer"  (word spreads fast around town, and I don't want to be known as a "queer".

I won't touch "designer drugs" with a 12 foot pole, (and I have one), because I had to sit through my neighbor pounding on my door at 0200 because he thought he was going to die.  That was enough to scare me off of that idea.  Fuck "designer drugs".  He refused the ambulance several times even though he was scared shitless.  I went to sleep before he did, but when I woke up the next "day", (all of 1.5 hrs later)  I rolled him over with my foot and said "hey, still alive?"  He grumbled and asked "where am I?"  I told him the address and said "you're alive.  Go home.  Whatever you did, don't do it again"  

You can stay here until 1200, then I expect you to make the journey back home of all of 20 feet"  He said "20 feet?"  can you help me to my couch?  I said "not a problem.  Where's your keys?"  He said  "I have keys?"  I said, "Umm let me check your house".  it was unlocked, so I just opened up the door as wide as it would go, and went and got him.  I lied and told him, "you left them in the lock, your house is open, I'll take you home."  He agreed, so I plopped him on his couch, locked the door behind me, and went to work. Dumbass high guy from Lithuania.  I should have called an ambulance.

Still, he refused medical treatment, so from my understanding there's nothing I can do.  I must have asked him 15 or 16 times if he wanted to go to the hospital.  He kept on refusing treatment, so from what I remembered from first aid training, I couldn't do anything until he went unconscious, (but I did first because of being tired).

**TL;DR;**  Fuck designer drugs.  I had one scare with that shit, that's enough for me.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My dad cut me off in 1999 because I was using too much of his internet time and hogging the phone line, so I ran my own line, and blueboxed an open frequency, and slam dialed every ISP in the Union to get a connection, and started dialing.  I eventually got through to an ISP in Topeka, KS, and I was caught in 2 hours because I only wanted free internet access without tying up my dads phone line.  (I stopped blue boxing, but I kept the phone line).   Everything about what I did was completely illegal, but I was  16 at the time, (I think that's the only reason they let it go, and I convinced them that I had no clue what was going on.)  My dad knew exactly what was going on.  He opened up the camper and said "XXXXXX, you need to take this call NOW.  It's the FBI!"  I knew exactly why I was getting the call.  Not doing that again.  (OK, I was cracking, not hacking).  But I didn't do it for commercial purposes, just "I want free internet".  (defrauding a public utility).  Yes, I kept the phone line, and now my home ranch has 2 lines. :) ) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with the fans, most are a bunch of rhinestone cowboys, (or all hat and not cattle), but the music itself is decent.  And it's not like country has a monopoly on monotonous themes.  

Ever heard a rap song?  It's about how much life in the ghetto sucks, (to get down to it), pimps, drugs, "hoes", or shooting cops, or other black people, and the N-word is used a lot, or shooting up who knows what.  

Rock is "drugs, sex, and rock and roll"

Classic Music is mostly about God and Nature, and war stories.

Country is about pickup trucks, God, TV, 9/11, America Is Best, Hard Working men, Urbanization, etc.

Death metal is about being pissed off.

Classic rock (like pink floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon, or "The Wall"), is mostly a life story, but also drugs, sex, and rock and roll.

Blues is how much life sucks, regardless of where you are from

Bluegrass?  I haven't figured out that one yet.

Pop music?  I love a dude, and he doesn't love me back.  I just want to dance, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think they do think it out, just pulling something out of my ass, but if I wanted to kill EMS workers, I'd report a false fire, (or start one in a skip), report it, and have trip wires on pipe bombs, and shoot mortars (the fireworks ones) at them.  That would actually cause a fire, and severely maim (or kill) whoever tripped the wire.

No, I have no intention of doing that.  I don't have a beef with anybody.  So burning your own house down and sitting there with an AK makes no sense at all. </TEXT>

I don't care whether it's the cops, or the neighbor pounding on my door in that circumstance.  I'll go investigate, then get the fuck out.  I was in a house fire in 2001, and ran outside with no pants on to see how bad it was.  Wasn't too bad, so I went back inside and put pants on.  By the time I got out again (maybe 30 seconds), the entire upstairs was engulfed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_citizen_movement#Theories

Legislated to give the freed black slaves after the Civil War rights comparable to the unalienable constitutional rights of white state citizens. The benefits of U.S. citizenship are received by consent in exchange for freedom. State citizens consequently take steps to revoke and rescind their U.S. citizenship and reassert their de jure common-law state Feucitizen status. This involves removing one's self from federal jurisdiction and relinquishing any evidence of consent to U.S. citizenship, such as a Social Security number, driver's license, car registration, use of ZIP codes, marriage license, voter registration, and birth certificate. Also included is refusal to pay state and federal income taxes because citizens not under U.S. jurisdiction are not required to pay them. Only residents (resident aliens) of the states, not its citizens, are income-taxable, state citizens argue. And as a state citizen land owner, one can bring forward the original land patent and file it with the county for absolute or allodial property rights. Such allodial ownership is held "without recognizing any superior to whom any duty is due on account thereof" (Black's Law Dictionary). Superiors include those who levy property taxes or who hold mortgages or liens against the property.[14]

Yep, it sounds like they think they are their own nation state.  That's fucked up man. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most shootings occur with gang-on-gang violence, and they're not supposed to have them in the first place.  It's already illegal to either supply felons with weapons, be a felon in a possession of a weapon, or do straw man purchases, or modify firearms to be automatic, or to alter the serial number, or import without a VERY thorough investigation, or a whole lot of other shit.

<TEXT> No, people shouldn't be forced to carry a weapon if they don't want to, (or don't know how to use it, then they shouldn't).  I'm just saying that "GUN FREE" = "Victim disarmament".  Gun control only disarms the people who are willing to stay within the law, not the criminal element.  When is the last time you heard of somebody holding a gun to somebody's head with the express intent of killing them, only to say "wait, murder is illegal, I better not do it or I'll go to prison"?  Never.

But if people had a chance to shoot back, these mass murders wouldn't happen.  I agree with you completely on the lack of professional journalism in the USA.  That's why I watch BBC, and listen to France24.  The only time I even am exposed to American "Journalism" is in my truck, and I keep it tuned to KQQQ and KQZB. </TEXT>

What the fuck?  And just a look will send you into shaking and trembling and cowering in the corner of the cab at 60 MPH to get away from her if she decides to hit you?  And she does the "mom count to 3" Really?  Then she thinks you were prank calling her the night before, so she beats you almost senseless when you're crying and begging her to stop, and your man cousin pulls her off because you're getting your ass kicked, and crying?  You can't recognize that as abusive?  What the hell is wrong with you?

**EDIT:** Yes, I know, /r/oddlyspecific  It got bad enough, that in my Senior year, I always had a tape recorder and video recorder on me.  That was more effective than the knive I've carried since age 10.  She did catch me a couple of times without my backpack though.  Those days weren't good. :( </TEXT>

I decided to stop because I was just too damned high.  I "took a break" lasting over 4 years because "I can't do this anymore".  I was so damned high, that I just had to stop because I couldn't know what was real or not, so I put the bong down, and "back to life, back to realty" was the hit song that 5 days of sobering up.

Yeah your life sucks, but the afterlife will be so much better!"

**EDIT:**  "Addiction counseling" is a sham designed to get people into the religion of AA.  Instead of 12 steps, (only which the first one has anything to do with insert drug, there should be two steps.  

* Step 1:  "Stop doing drugs".  
* Step 2:  See step 1.

<TEXT> I've only done it with text on IM, and intro'ed songs to people on FB. I know how to introduce a song, and start up a playlist, but I think I sound strange even on a PA system at walmart. (where I used to work). I have no idea how I sound recorded, it's been over 25 years since I've taped myself. (I was a kid with a tape recorder).

I've DXed for about half of my life, and can build AM and FM reception antennas with no problems.  I used to use a CB in the grain truck when I was growing up, (and a couple of times after I became an adult to report emergencies using channels 3 and 9)  Other than that, I have no experience on the air.  All I know about it is "don't cuss, and ID yourself every 15 minutes of broadcast, and you can't play music on CB frequencies".

I don't think terrestrial radio is ever going to die.  Sat radio is about $10/mo, and not worth it IMHO. AM/FM is free, and you might have a lot of crappy stations, but you do get a couple of good ones that are worth listening to.

I want to work for a classic rock station.  I don't think I would do too well in a pop music station.  "and here's some more teeny-bopper crap for the 11 year olds".  Yeah, I don't think that would fly too well.  Give me Led Zeppelin, Twisted Sister, Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd, and Iron Maiden. Hell, throw in some AC/DC and Metallica for good measure. :)  I would rock their socks off. :)

I know I couldn't be the AM Radio KQQQ morning news guy, (I can't talk that long), but on 100.5FM, I could do it, (but I would have to watch my mouth so I don't get fined by the FCC). </TEXT>

Who cares if the other 99 people are worse off?  If they want more of that money, they should get a job from the dude who has the money.  Like the saying goes.  "He who has the gold, makes the rules".

And no, I didn't get it from Faux News, (I don't even know what channel it's on), or Limbaugh.  I stopped listening to that blowhard back in 2005.  I got that conclusion from the OWS crowd where they want to "eat the rich", and "spread the wealth around".  They're complaining about being poor, but they have iPhones, and Macbook Airs.  Yeah, "poor".  My white ass.  If they're poor and can afford that shit, (more likely their parents bought it for them), then the Pope is middle-class.

<TEXT> I've wondered this too. Back in the 90's when I only had antenna service, I actually hoped for shitty weather because that was the only time I could pick up Fox. I missed the finale of ST:V because we had good weather that day. I was pissed off for 2 weeks.

Anyhow, from what I remember from TV DX magazine, bad weather is often accompanied by low atmospheric pressure and low(er) surface temperatures. This allows the TV signal to bounce off of the ionosphere, and come to your antenna. 

To test this hypothesis, you could go out with your garden hose and spray your antenna. Try it both at night, and during the day at the height of heat. That will see if water has anything to do with your reception. </TEXT>

You have work to do on the ranch, and have no time to "blow" before school.  After school, you feed the animals, so cleanup around the ranch, and watch TV.  I could have if I wanted, but I honestly had no time for trivial pursuits in social engagement.

How has it affected me?  Well, I finally got really high and got laid at 27 years old.  I got her pregnant so we got married.  We had a son.  2 years later in 2012, she wanted another kid.  I fucked her without a condom and got her pregnant.  Wife left, kids lost.  Reality sucks.  I'm never dating again, and I'm 32 years old.  It's simply not worth my time to ever try dating again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The only advice I have is if you move to a location where you cannot receive service (clear view of the southern sky), then they'll let you out without any consequences.  Much like how to get out of a cellphone contract.  Or, wait until they send you a "user member agreement" update, and disagree with a clause.  You have 30 days to bail without any consequences.

**TL;DR:**  Move to where you can't get service; or review the revised member agreement when you get one in the mail, and find something to disagree with. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of course the national leaders (and the uber rich), get a higher standard of care than joe blow off of the street.  They have the money to afford it, so they can buy it.  Just like in a car, you can buy the $0.50 sparkplugs, and no-name oil, or you can buy the $7 (each spark plugs coated in platinum, with "triple fire technology", and synthetic oil.  With more money, comes more choice in what you can afford.  

Should everybody be forced to drive a 18 year old truck that leaks coolant, just because I do?  Or should I be able to get a Jaguar becaus some rich people buy them?  Of course not.  There is a different vehicle and different levels of services for people of different income levels.  Healthcare isn't much different.

I did watch the video, and he stated his points well.  However, he neglected the one reason that US healthcare is more expensive.  Namely, R D costs, and the patent system.  In countries such as the UK or Australia, the government holds the exclusive patent rights to the medications and medical technology, and it is shared immediately.  In the USA, there is a 7 year patent, and generics are prohibited during that time.

If it was a work related activity, that meets the requirements in WA to qualify as "work search".  However, when you are unemployed, there is no such thing as "vacation days".  Sure, you can sit on your ass on the weekend, but you are expected to make an active search for work.  When I was a maintenance man, I had vacation time, but never used it.  I had over 168 hours of banked up vacation time that I refused to use.  Upon separation of employment, I got a "free" month of pay in addition to unemployment.  I don't believe in taking vacations.

And if I was a "captain of industry" like you seem to like that term, I would be smoking Cuban cigars on my yacht, and have a runabout in my yacht so I could make it to shore.  My "runabout" would be a 32 foot boat, and I would have a skip on that if I wanted to go into an area where there are no docks.  That would be a "captain of industry".

We actually have no "trade" schools within 31 miles.  The one 50 miles away, (WWCC), churns out nurses, and CNA's and tech support people.  Nothing else is offered.  I could cross state lines and pay $8000/semester, but incurring $32,000 of debt just to get a $30,000 job still is a wash at best.  There is no point to getting a degree that doesn't pay off in a maximum of 2 years, (and be debt free).  

he strange thing is, the one school, (LCSC), that I could attend a trade school to be a diesel technician, or a welder, or a plumber, (or whatever), is actually closer to me (28 miles), than the nearest in-state  trade school.  After that, it's a 78 mile one way trip to SFCC.  Can you tell I live basically in the middle of nowhere?

Trade schools do have their place, as they teach practical skills that generate income.  However, the "general studies", or "Major in philosophy, minor in Arabic" degrees are completely useless.  Being "well rounded" doesn't matter for shit if you get several tens of thousands of dollars in debt, and work at starbucks or drive a taxi.  That was just a waste of money.  They would have been economically better off if they had just never went to school in the first place.

Also, I did it exactly once because I needed food.  I hardly made a living at it.  And one hour for $50 of food is almost like I got paid to sit through the rambling nonsense of the preacher.  "food from god"  Yeah, right.  it's food from people who saw fit to donate to a cause that they supported, (feeding the needy).  "God" had nothing to do with it, any more than he does with the turds coming out of a cow's asshole while it eats on the range.

And if you were traveling the world, you weren't exactly "available for work each and every day", were you?  That is a requirement to collect unemployment.  You also have to make a minimum of 3 contacts per week, and actively look for work.  I'm fully aware of WA State requirements for collecting unemployment insurance.

Once again, I spent one hour there, and got "paid" for my time by food.  Pretty good deal.  Considering I can live easily on less than $100/mo by myself, and with my wife and daughter, I can keep it under $150/mo.  It's not exactly hard to eat on a tight budget, but eating out is a luxury that only happens about once a season.  (just like it used to be when I grew up).

Define "learn something useful".  If you mean Medieval History of Europe, or XXX studies, or philosophy, I consider those useless pursuits.  If it's not a tangible skill, I have no interest in learning it.  If it can't generate income, there is no purpose to learning it.  I do not care about "being well rounded".  I care about putting money in my pocket, and nothing else.  Also, the last I checked, school doesn't pay you to be there.  Internships are full of shit, and an excuse for free labor.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> The last war we explicitly fought for oil was Iraq in the early 90's, after Soddomy Insane invaded Kuwait.   Also, we don't get most of our oil from the ME.  We get it from USA, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and then Saudi Arabia.  

However, because we are now fracking, we could cut out Saudi oil, and it wouldn't really affect us.  In case you haven't checked, the world petroleum market is an international commodity.  You likely get fuel from Saudi Arabia too.

As far as domestic oil production, yes it is.  Maybe you've heard of Standard Oil?  They were broken up in 1911.  We now have Exxon, Shell, Chevron, Tesoro, etc.  All private industries. </TEXT>

People learn differently, and should be targeted with a curriculum that suits them, not what the NEA says everybody needs.  What use does a future plumber or welder have for French or Japanese?  Similarly, what use does a future accountant have for shop classes?  This is one lesson from Europe that the USA should take.  The Germans do it better, so we should do what China is so famous for, and copy them.

<TEXT> Five times more?  Yeah right.  $20 for a checkup?  Sure, if it was 1995.  Here in the 21st century, we have to pay for services rendered.  If you think about it, a doctor's visit is actually still cheaper than going to an auto dealer and having your vehicle worked on for one hour.  Per flat rate hour, it's $160 to have a technician look at your vehicle.  Just want them to pull the codes? (takes all of 30 seconds), That'll be $80.  Minimum billable rate is a half hour.

And if you're unemployed and think you're "too good" for any work, you're a damned leech, and deserve no support.  If you can't find work, that's one thing, but if you turn down an offer of work, you're obviously not that needy, so you should get no support from society.

<TEXT> On STATE and COUNTY roads, not the federal road network.  If it wasn't for JIT delivery, the interstate system could disappear right now, and I wouldn't notice a bit of difference.  

Petroleum is bought at the fuel station, (which is a privately owned business), shipped in large tanker trucks (also a private business), after being refined from oil, (also a private business), that was extracted from the ground by a large oil company, (also a private business).

Who's safety standards is my vehicle in compliance with?  Likely nobody's  It's a 1997 Chevrolet Blazer LT.  I know for a fact it wouldn't pass emissions.  But WA state doesn't have emissions checks outside of King and Spokane county.  Hell, I run a straight pipe.  I cut out the catalytic converter 5 years ago.

Education isn't "free".  Somebody is paying for it.  In the USA for K-12, it's the land owners that pay for the "free" education of primary and secondary school.  If you're poor enough, you can even make a little bit of money with the Pell grant system if you attend a community college.  

You won't be out a damned dime, all books would be covered, and you'll even make a little bit of money on top of that.  University is expensive.  About $25,000 a year for instate tuition, plus all the fees.  That's unreasonable, and the only way somebody could afford that without debt is to be independently wealthy, (or have connections).

And enrolling in school with a bunch of teens and 20 somethings is right in the list of my priorities the day after WWIII happens, and we bomb each other with dildos made out of silly putty.  College is completly useless at the community college level here.  I could get a degree in "customer service" for $12000, which would qualify me to .... work retail.  Yay.  Or you know, I can just go work retail, and skip all the debt and unneeded expenses.  Dropping 12k to get a 17.5k/year job.  Yeah, that's a good investment.  NOT.

Whoop de fucking doo, you're an engineer, and have more money than god.  I never will.  I've long given up on dreaming.  Dreaming happens when you sleep, and it isn't real.  People who still "dream" as adults have too much time on their hands, and need to get back to reality.  Life is what it is, and no amount of fantasizing of hoping or wishing will change it.

And for your information, I only went once back in 2010, and haven't went back yet.  (I have no need to).  In addition to giving them a whole truck load after that one time, I'll still occasionally buy a few extra things at IGA, and put them in the buggies that are set up for donations.  I've been there, and know how much it sucks, so if I can make somebody's day a little bit less sucky because I put in a flat of chilli, good.  It's not like it's expensive.  For $12, they get 15 cans. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Healthcare should have minimum standards as set by the CDC, (and they are), but beyond that, only emergent care should be subsidised.  For a regular checkup, pay the damned bill.  It's only $100.  I don't even remember the last time I even saw a doctor.  Yes, I make little enough that I do qualify for medicaid, but I don't even bother using it.  I really have no reason to see a doctor even once a year.

The church specifically isn't the best arbiter of where resources should go, but private charities are better than government largess.  Remember NOLA?  Who were the first trucks to deliver supplies there?  Was it Red Cross, or the national gaurd?  Nope.  It was Walmart.  They sent trucks in with batteries, potable water, propane tanks, tarps, etc.  All free.  Regarding articles:  Here you go:

http://www.forbes.com/sites/howardhusock/2014/04/10/lesson-for-april-15-why-government-cant-replace-charity/

I've never heard a thing called Jesus syndrome, and no, there is no virtue in suffering.  It should be a temporary thing, (if it exists), not a lifestyle.  Hard times come, and hard times go.  But if they come and stay, the problem isn't with the system, it's with you.  If a person thinks they are "above" a job while unemployed, they have some twisted sense of reality.  Do whatever it takes to keep the lights on.  Dreams are for children, and reality takes the driver's seat once you're an adult.

Yes, socialism, is government control of the economy, while the corporation is worker-owned.  Communism is where the government owns and controls everything. from how many bolts will be made in XXX factory, to how many potatoes will be harvested that year, and who will receive those potatoes.

<TEXT> I drove there, and called them up to see what the hours of the food bank were, (I saw a flier on a pole, so I took the number, and called to verify).  I don't hardly ever use federal highways.  I travel on state/county/city roads almost exclusively.  I was last on the interstate last January.  Hell, the nearest interstate is over 75 miles north of me.

I've only done it once, (can't shoot a wheat field to get bread).  But yes, I did repay them back many times over.  I got maybe $50 worth of food, but once I went back to work, I loaded up my truck and gave them back $258 worth of food.  Unlike the government, where whatever they give you was compulsory taken from somebody else. private charities are willingly donated to.  

I'm 32 years old, and I'm willing to bet you're an early 20 something who think that the government is the best solution to all of society's ills.  If that were the case, the USSR would have never failed, and the DDR would have built the wall to keep people out, (like we do with Mexico), instead of people in.

Yeah, you probably got in free because you either greased some palms, or had connections.  I wouldn't go to school even if it were free.  I would only do it if it were free, all books were paid for, and I got paid at least $19,000 a year to attend.  That's never going to happen, so I'll never attend.  It's not worth it.

I boggled thier mind when I told them I have a donation, and I'm going to need help to unload it.  They were pleasantly surprised when they asked what I wished to donate, and told them "Everything in the truck"

That's the difference between private charities and government entities.  What the government gives out to somebody, they have forcibly taken from somebody else.  When a private charity gives out goods, those goods were willingly given to that charity without threat of force.  

Government should not be in the charity business, it should be left to the private sector.  They are more efficient, and know where resources are needed.  If the government were better at resource utilization, the USSR would have never fell, and the DDR would have built the wall to keep the west out, and not the East in. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My bedroom TV is from 2002, and it doesn't even have a ATSC tuner in it.  I have it plugged direct into the wall, going through a QAM converter box to pick up digital channels.  I WON'T rent a cable box.  I don't want the CATV company seeing what I watch on my own private line.  Fuck targeted advertising.  If the day ever comes where I can't just plug in the line, and do a channel scan, I'm dumping CATV.  I've already started hooking up my "new" antenna.  I just have to figure out how to build a YAGI. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not a Luddite.  I don't fear technology is going to put me out of work, (I'll do anything), nor am I technologically adverse.  I just don't like GPS, cameras, or mics.  (unless I'm taping something).  Yes, I still use my VCR.  My laptop is outdated enough, (Eee PC 1000HD), that Windows XP fully updated takes about 45 minutes to boot.  Windows 7 took 20 minutes.  

I completely got rid of Windows on it back in 2011, and replaced it with Debian running LXDE as the DE.  I have WINE 1.7 installed, so I CAN run Win32 programs if I really want to.  I haven't found a need to yet.  I'm thinking about swapping out my HDD for a SSD to make it boot faster, but it works fine for me.  I run Debian Sid.  I run Windows 10 on my desktop, but as far as portability and performance are concerned, Windows can go blow goats. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A train traveling through the DDR is carrying Stalin, Krushchev, and Breznev through the Urals. It breaks down.

Stalin lines up the crew of the train, the local villagers, and the passengers, and shoots every 5th person.

Krushchev lines up the survivors and gives them a rousing speech about how much better Soviet trains will run in 7 years.

Breznev sits back down, pulls the blind shut, bounces up and down in his seat, and pretends the train is still running.

The DDR politburo votes themselves out of office because the train won't run.

<TEXT> Yes, a couple of times I've had to go to the church food bank just to keep food on the table, (I had meat from the deer, but nothing else).  I'll sit through a sermon to get bread and chilli, and 1 can of soda, and pinto beans.  It's humiliating, but if it keeps my wife and daughter fed, I'll do it.  It sucks, but you gotta do what you gotta do to keep food on the table.

Yes, I would much rather be independent, and get off of assistance as fast as possible, but being unemployed for 7 months not knowing how to keep the lights on, or where your next meal is coming from kind of sucks.  Actually, it sucks a lot.  I didn't have to worry about losing my place, because I paid a year ahead.  I got CATV because I have cable tools.  I wasn't ballsy enough to fuck with the electric box.  That shit can, (and will), kill you, (if you don't burn alive first).

Temporary stop-gap measures are one thing, (that's why safety nets exist, to keep you from falling to your metaphorical death), but it's a net, not a damned hammock.  I gave up my daughter for adoption later, because I reasoned "if I can't even feed myself without resorting to poaching and begging churches, how the hell am I going to feed a kid?  I can't even afford diapers for her, and she's using my old shirts."  I went on a 15 mile walk that day, and almost didn't come back home.  I was thinking one thing that day.  "Head south".  Where I was going?  I have no clue beyond "south". I got a ride back to town with the county sheriff.  My wife called me in, and the sheriff convinced me to get in his rig so he could take me back home. </TEXT>

It's "within the confines of the constitution" proposition.  Also, the Federal government only pays for the US road network, and Interstate system.  County roads are paid by the county, city roads by the city, and state routes by the state.  The Federal government really has very little say in the road infrastructure. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually, I would expect people raised by parents who can't keep to a simple buget to be more advantaged.  They saw what not living within your income will do.  (power shut off, loss of cable TV, having to sell drugs just to make ends meet, eviction, etc).  That is a good lesson on what **NOT** to do.  

Yes, there is a difference between taking SNAP in a temporary situation, and making a lifesyle out of it.  If you need it temporarily because you honestly can't afford to feed your family, or if you "poach" a deer for nothing but the meat, (I didn't see anything).  Shit happens, and a temporary helping hand (or a blind eye), can work wonders.  But if you make a lifestyle choice out of being a welfare queen, then you should be thrown out on the streets, and have all your benefits cut for life.

I've been within 12 hours of having my utilities cut, and I went hat in hand to CAC for emergency electricity assistance.  I've got it once.  I was literally looking at having my power cut in the middle of January, and Project Share through Avista kept my lights on.  That was the most embarrassing day of my life.  I shot a whitetail deer that year to keep my family fed, and I didn't have a license.  I did it out of need, not want.  (it was out of season anyways, so I couldn't have gotten a licence even if I wanted to).  But then again, if I could afford the hunting license, I wouldn't be illegally harvesting game, would I?

Yes, sometimes times can get tough, and people do need a helping hand, but if you make it a lifestyle, you're a fucking mooch, and should be thrown out on your ass.  BTW, I don't have my parents to rely on.  My dad died in 2010.  My mom is too busy traveling the country to CA and AZ outrunning the cold.  I have my step-mom.  I've only called her once, and that was when I stupidly parked in a neighbor's parking spot and got a $500 tow bill for one day.  I owe her that money back, and I fully intend to repay her, (whenever I can scare up the $380 that I have remaining). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Then you have SSI, and SSDI in case of an intractable severe mental of physical illness.  Those are special cases.  I was thinking more along of the welfare queens who crank out children so they can get TANF and food stamps, and section 8 housing, and Medicaid.  They don't work because they don't want to, not because they physically cannot.  If you had shitty parents, it's time to grow up and learn to make your own way in the world.  

I grew up upper-middle income, and at 32 years old, I make less than $20,000 a year.  Hell, the most I ever made was $10/hr in 2008.  Adjusted for inflation, that's $11.12/hr in today's dollars.  I honestly don't think I'll ever earn $80,000 a year, or even $24000 a year, (adjusted for inflation).  Still, there is value in independence, and not having your ass pampered by the "all knowing and all caring government". </TEXT>

There is no requirement for them to keep analog service on, but I still have analog service, and ClearQAM.  Note that they could have shut it off back in 2012 if they wanted to.

<TEXT> I tried to sign on with my TWC ID, but since I'm only an internet/phone subscriber, I don't get shit.  I want channel surfing, that's why I stay with TV service. How I get it, I honestly don't care.  I miss NTSC. :(  I miss rolloff, instead of this new "digital cliff"  Yeah, watching channels in B/W with almost no audio sucked, but better than nothing.  ATSC standards suck. :(  I'd like to bitch slap the asshole at the FCC who made this decision.  Here's my TV Fool:

<TEXT> Why I still have traditional service?  Because I can just press "up" and watch something new without having to think about it.  No pre-scheduling, no "does thiis meet your standards", no "upvote".  Just change the channel if it sucks what your watching.  That's why I'll never get rid of TV service.  I'm trying to build a decent antenna, but I need to get this thing called a "combiner".  Fuck, antennas have changed a lot over the last 20 years.  Before, the bigger the better. and adjustable antennas were boss.  Now, amplified antennas are complete shit, and outdoor antennas can be used as indoor antennas?  It makes no sense.  Maybe I should go back to buiding my own like I did in the 90's? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I bought a $9 set of rabbit ears with a UHF loop on it, and an amplified antenna at WM for $49.95,  The amplified antenna can't pick up anything, but the rabbit ears let me pull in 6 channels, (4 of them PBS, ABC (analog), and CBS).  So what is the point of amplified indoor antennas when they don't pick up anything, and actually perform worse than a standard set of rabbit ears? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know that's very illegal, (at least in WA and ID), so I don't think anybody would be ballsy enough to impersonate a marked police vehicle, but undercovers?  That's easy.  Hell, I already look like a WSU maintenence vehicle, (from the dealership, I didn't get custom paint), minus the orange globe on top.  I can already drive basically wherever I want on WSU, so long as I abide by maintenance vehicle restrictions, it's not hard to get away with driving on "authorized vehicles and pedestrians only" roads, or on sidewalks, or up stairs, or anywhere I want to go.  

I've parked for HOURS directly across from the police department, and nobody cared.  No citations, no towing, nothing.  Not even a note.  I just drove like I was supposed to be there.  Of course, I used to work there, and am well aware of how maintenance vehicles are supposed to drive on "closed" roads, so abide by that, and no problems.  

Yes, I only did it when I had a good reason to, (wife was 8 months pregnant, and she can't walk up hills without risking falling over).  But without modifications, I can easily pass as a maintenance vehicle at WSU.  I even got Whitman County to drop a couple of "illegal parking" tickets, because I had a pregnant wife who couldn't walk more than 30 yards.  She had door to door service.  I drove anywhere I wanted, just abiding by the maintenance vehicle code.

Park outside the CUB for a couple hours?  Not a problem.  Drive down the chipman trail on WSU?  Not a problem.  I only got "illegal parking" when I using all the powers of dumbassery parked on the steps.  (people were in my way, so I couldn't park on level ground).  (yes, I know it wasn't very smart parking on stairs, because if my e-brake failed, it would cause at least 100 deaths, I got lectured by the judge on that one).  But as long as I wasn't dangerously parked, nobody cared at all, or even noticed my vehicle). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cause I was 19 at the time, and had no clue (still don't), what they do with a road kill animal, (well, "almost-kill" [it was parylized when I saw it, so I shot it because it was suffering]).  I didn't want it, so I told them to give it to the battered women's shelter, (hey, they need meat), since I don't want it to go to waste.  Yes, I shot it, but from the front of the vehicle that collided with it, and the deer, it was obvious that I wasn't poaching.  I just had to unload, (not hard, it was a single shot), and give them the spent shell.  I kept my .410, and they sent me on my way.  I'll never forget that "conversation".  

"Did you see anything?"

"Yes.  I deer stumbling in the road, and a wrecked car.  These people pointing to the people looking on were in the car."

"Did you do anything?"

"Asked if they were OK.  They don't seem to need medical attention.  I shot the deer."

"I'm sorry, you did what?"

"I shot the deer.  It looked to be parylized.  I shot it in the head and put it out of it's misery.  The deer is over here".

"Sir, what did you shoot it with?  It seems to missing about a quarter of the left side of it's head."

"My SS .410"  The shell is over there"

"OK.  I'm going to need the shell you have loaded, and I need to inspect your weapon"

"OK"

...

"It seems everything checks out.  Do you wish to keep this animal?"

"No, give it to the battered women's shelter or something.  I don't want it.  I just didn't want it to suffer."

"Here is your shotgun.  Please do not load it, and have a good day sir."

 I flip a Uie, and go back to town </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally, if somebody burst in here, the threat would be stopped, and you'll be chasing somebody neutralized.  (or not chasing him as the case may be).  Hopefully once he realized he had nowhere to run, or use force against, he would surrender and play "spider on the ground", but I'm prepared if I need to be, (legally, I don't violate the NFA, or any state statutes).  If all I have to yell is "HEY!" and they run off, good!

Shit, now the police reaction to me pulling up to WaMu to have my wife get money out of the ATM makes sense.  I pulled up, and I saw several patrol vehicles there, and didn't think anything of it.  Wife got out of the car, and I was sitting in the seat smoking.  Officer walks by and asks what I'm doing, so I told him, "my wife wants some cash from the ATM and she's right there", [literally right in front of me].

He told me to stay in the vehicle, and walked off carrying an AR in a 1pt sling in low ready.  I don't know where the hell he was going, but he seemed like he was on a mission.  Yes, I stayed in the vehicle.  I didn't really think much of it beyond "this is odd".  To this day, I still don't even know what the hell I rolled up on.  The bank was closed, so it couldn't have been a bank robbery.  Training thing maybe?  That's the only thing I can think of.

<TEXT> Just a normal cop car without lights?  Doesn't make me nervous, I've just never seen one before besides earlier today.  I thought it was strange.  I was airing up my tires, and saw it pass by.  It looked strange to me, since I expect cop cars to have a light bar like ambulances or fire trucks.  Emergency vehicles = lightbar, as far as I'm concerned.  I saw one without one, so I wondered why that car exists, (since I never saw one before).  It made me look twice.  I didn't think much of it beyond "Hmm, weird.  33 lbs, 35 lbs .... 50 lbs... OH SHIT!  Pfffffffffff. 44 lbs.  Cool.  On to the next tire." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't like the slick top rigs because I could EASILY do that myself (if I had enough money).  I drive a crimson and grey 97 Blazer LT, and it looks enough like a WSU rig that I get no shit if I drive on "authorized vehicles only" roads up at WSU.  I've parked for a couple hours, and locked my rig, and nobody touched it, or ticketed me, or even left me a note.  I look like a normal WSU maintenance vehicle minus the orange globe on top.  I've done nothing special to my rig beyond "buy it from the dealer", but I can pass as a WSU maintenance vehicle, when I'm directly parked across the street from the police department.

The only thing visually seperating me from a WSU Police vehicle?  No light bar, no large aerials, no state plates, and no push bar.  The only thing separating me from a maintenance vehicle?  No orange orb.  But if I wanted all of that shit, if I had about $3000, nobody would be able to tell the difference, (besides the logos of the local police).  [That's not too hard to get](http://www.decaldriveway.com/) if I wanted to.

Just knowing how easy it would be to impersonate a police officer if if I felt so inclined, (NO I DON'T!), and just a normal passenger vehicle can be easily passed off as a maintenance vehicle makes me have reservations about unmarked vehicles.  Hell, I don't even need an orange globe to drive wherever I want on WSU campus, I just have to drive like I work there, and am on official business, (less than 15 MPH at all times, and when pedestrians are present, less than 5 MPH).  Of course, it does help that I used to work there in maintenance, so I know the procedures for driving on "Pedestrian Only:  Closed to traffic except for authorized vehicles" road.

Also, the one time I got pulled over for jumping a red, (didn't run it, jumped it, (treated it as a 4 way, and went for it), I actually purposly went to the center lane, turned on my 4 ways, and drove to the nearest gas station and parked under the fueling area.  I didn't see him, so I didn't know who was trying to pull me over.  I made sure that the stop was on video tape, because I didn't know who was stopping me or why.  (I fucked up, and jumped the red), and got let go).  [not doing that again, and the officer gave me a good reason why]  "What if I was trying to get on to the road?  You obviously didn't see me, so what else could you have missed?"  Want to kill somebody today?"  I had no answer for that, and I don't jump reds anymore. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But what do you use them for?  I carry a sidearm on my person, (so I don't get killed if somebody shoots at me, at least I'll have a fighting chance), and a .410 in case I come across road almost-kill, (I've had to use it before), but why an MP5?  Do you have to do residential breeches or something?  Surely it's not to send roadkill to meet it's maker?  Yeah, if somebody's shooting at you, I fully expect you to shoot back, but why a SMG?  What do you use them for?  (yay for WA, they let you keep roadkill if you want it).  No, I didn't keep it, I told the officer to give it to the battered women's shelter or whatever they do with it.  I only shot it because it was going to die anyways, and I didn't want it to suffer.  My only word to the deer was "sorry".  BANG!  (after I distracted the kids at the scene by having them look at the "pretty mountain, isn't it pretty how all that snow is up there?  Just think about sledding.") </TEXT>

I could barely see where I was going), and still almost got into a head-on.  I found myself in the center lane before a car passed me in the opposite direction, and wondered "why is that car so close to me?"

<TEXT> Do drivers recognize that you're a patrol vehicle when you light them up, or think you're some asshole pranking as a cop so they pull over so assumed asshole can blow by them at highway speeds?  (serious question)  

If I got stopped by one of those "concealed light" rigs, I would slow down, call 911, turn on my 4 ways, and proceed to the nearest well lit area before stopping.  No light bar on top?  I'm not stopping.  How do I know you're not some dickhole who likes making people shit a brick for no reason?  

In my book, cop cars have lights on the top.  Concealed bars are about one step above some random driver trying to get me to stop for I don't know why.  Undercover vehicles?  (no markings), I'm going to pull over in a well lit area, where there are plenty of witnesses, and I'm calling 911.  Any joe schmoe on the internet can buy red and blues if he wants, and sirens aren't that hard to obtain either.

<TEXT> You could leave your house unlocked, and windows open while you sleep, and wouldn't worry about getting robbed.

You could leave your windows down, keys in the ignition, and truck running while going into the store for a little bit, and not worry if your rig will still be there when you get out. The most that would happen is somebody might turn your ignition off, figuring you forgot about it.

If you broke down along the road, people would actually stop and see if they could help you, instead of just driving by and pretending they didn't see you.

Children were expected to behave, and bad behavior in public settings such as restaurants and stores was not tolerated by either the general public, or the parents.

Children could go to the store, or park without parental escort; and nobody thought twice about a child unattended taking a city bus. CPS didn't get involved because you let your children have some independence.

If it was during school hours, and children were seen roaming the street, it wasn't uncommon to ask them "Shouldn't you be in school?" or "Do you need a ride to school?"

If children missed the bus to school, they were expected to walk, (or take their bike), to school; not call mommy and daddy at work to get a ride.

Perpetual victimhood was frowned upon. Yeah, you got a raw deal. Everybody has something to bitch about. Life isn't fair, get used to it.

No participation trophies. You deserve praise because you accomplished something, or went above and beyond the call of duty. Not simply because you breathe free air. 

In the game of life, there are winners and losers. Regardless how hard you try, you still may not succeed. You didn't win. Sorry, you lost. Yes, you may have tried. That doesn't make you a "winner in your heart", you are still a loser in the game of life, but at least you lost with dignity.

Please and thank you were common, and expected. It used to be considered common courtesy to hold open a door for the elderly, ladies, infirmed, people in a rush, and people carrying things. 

Also offering them a buggy, or taking it back into the store for them used to be a kind gesture that wasn't expected.  It was polite, not "rude", "demeaning", or "mysoganist".

People had a sense of community, and you knew your neighbors, and they knew you. You could ask them for help, and they could of you too. It might be as simple as, "hey, I'm going on vacation for a week, can you water my lawn?" Or something like "I just bought a new couch, and I need help getting it out of my truck. Can you help?". People were glad to help.

Fortunately, I still live in one of these areas. All of America should be like this. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  If you do the math, there's plenty of time to be enrolled FT, and work FT.  There are 168 hours in a week.

    12 hours of class
    12 hours of study
    40 hours to work
    56 hours to sleep
    10 hours to eat
    3 hours to keep house
    14 hours to relax
    Total hours used per week:  147
    Total hours per week: 168
    Total hours left unused:  21

That gives you 21 hours to socialize.  If you do this, not only will you pass, but you won't have a damned bit of debt when you graduate, and will still have time to make friends. </TEXT>

*"In television, we're attempting first to make better utilization of the bandwidth, because we think we can eventually get in excess of 2000 lines instead of 525 ... and do it on an even narrower channel ... which will make for a much sharper picture. We believe in the picture-frame type of a picture, where the visual display will be just a screen. And we hope for a memory, so that the picture will be just as though it's pasted on there."*

<TEXT> No, at the choke points, we would arrest entrants into the country, and deport them 2000 miles into mexico.  They just get shipped back, but not blown halfway to hell.    I don't think the CIA backed coup would do much good, in addition to the corrupt federal government, you also have the leaders of the federal police, the state and local governments, and the Mexican military.  

That whole country is corrupt, and I think we should drop Mexico from NAFTA, and impose heavy trade tariffs of 50% or greater for any goods imported from Mexico.  Do a war of economic attrition.  Also, don't export anything to Mexico.  Of course, this didn't exactly work with Cuba, so Mexico may be a lost cause. </TEXT>

Also, the Indians were too busy fighting each other, and they really had no concept of land ownership.  They had hunting grounds, and areas they lived in during different times of the year, but no borders. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, no, I don't want to blow the illegal immigrants half way to hell and back, just the cartels.  Yes, it would be unrealistic to do this, (as it would be very expensive), but we could let a few choke points open, so they have to go through that area if they don't want to get blown up.  I highly doubt the Mexican people are going to stage a revolution against the drug cartels, and corrupt government that can be bought with money.  

From what I read, the Mexican people aren't even allowed to have any semi-automatic weapons, and have to use lever action rifles, or single shots, (and only then, if they aren't a military caliber).  There is no "bringing Mexico up" to our economic level.  With the government in power there, and the cartels, there is no chance in hell of helping that country at all.  I think we fucked up by signing the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.  We could have had that entire country as the USA.  

Except then, we would have to deal with Guatemala.  That border, we could seal.  What I think is sad, is Guatemala is so damned poor, Mexico has an illegal immigration problem from there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually, that's not too far off.  In Peru, a kilo of cocaine costs about [$800](http://www.insightcrime.org/news-briefs/peruvian-cocaine-best-value-for-traffickers-bolivia-police).  Once it gets here to the USA, that same kilo in the USA costs around [$27,000](https://www.stratfor.com/weekly/mexicos-cartels-and-economics-cocaine). Those are wholesale prices.  Then it gets down to the street level, where an 8 ball costs around $350, (the last I checked).  So, that's 3.5g for $350. That's $100,000 of money to buy a kilo of cocaine in the USA off of the street.

Yes, the low-level street dealers, (that often work for below minimum wage), their suppliers, the distributors all get the cut, as do the mules, but most of that money is funneled right back into the Cartel hands. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not the unarmed ones.  In that case, just call INS/USBP.  But if they start shooting?  Shoot back.  Actually, this is already legal.  The only thing that would change is we would be arming them with military weapons, instead of letting them arm themselves with semi-automatic look-alikes.  I think a few cartel groups getting mowed down with M240 SAWs would send a message.  And if they come with vehicles?  A BGM-71 takes care of that.  

Set up antipersonnel and anti-vehicle mines along the border, and set up hedgehogs lined with concentra wire, and caltrops.  Put in anti-tank ditches too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> (nuclear war) [Wish You Were Here  
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXdNnw99-Ic)

    So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.
    Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
    A smile from a veil?
    Do you think you can tell?

    Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
    Hot ashes for trees?
    Hot air for a cool breeze?
    Cold comfort for change?
    Did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

    How I wish, how I wish you were here.
    We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,
    Running over the same old ground.
    What have we found?

    The same old fears.
    Wish you were here.

(about a wasted life) [Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rL3AgkwbYgo)

    Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day 
    Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
    Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
    Waiting for someone or something to show you the way

    Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain
    And you are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
    And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
    No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

    And you run and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
    Racing around to come up behind you again
    The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
    Shorter of breath and one day closer to death

    Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
    Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
    Hanging on quiet desperation is the English way
    The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

    Home, home again
    I like to be here when I can
    And when I come home cold and tired
    It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
    Far away across the field
    The tolling of the iron bell
    Calls the faithful to their knees
    To hear the softly spoken magic spells. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was 17, I wanted to be a locksmith owning my own businuss in Las Vegas, earning around $75000 a year in 1999 dollars, living a couple miles outside of town on a 2 acre property that I owned, with a triple wide mobile home bought on a 15 year mortgage, driving a 2 or 3 year old paid off truck.  If it had gone to plan, I would have about 3 years left on my mortgage, and I would be financially secure with zero debt besides my home.

I'm 32 years old, and still living in the same county that I was born.  I moved 16 miles to town off of the family ranch, and I drive a 18 year old truck, and I live in a rental property.  I'm now unemployed, and the highest wage I've ever earned was $10/hr back in 2008.  So no, my dream did not come true.

I have given up on dreams.  They are futile, and the realm of children.  They serve no purpose in the adult world, and I only exist to survive now.  I see no point in dreaming or fantasizing about that which I will never realistically have, or be able to obtain.  It is a waste of time to dream.

<TEXT> The other day I noticed several rabbits running next to my window.  1, "hey, that's pretty."  2, "Hmm, must be mating season" 5, "Umm?"  10, "what the fuck?  where all all these rabbits coming from?"  20, "OK, time for mister air gun."

I went outside and was starting to set up because it's obvious that I now have a rabbit infestation, I don't want to kill them all, just a few because I don't want my lawn ruined, and they seem to be already wearing a path through my front lawn.

Before I even got set up, I had my pistol just sitting in plain sight, and some dude happens to walk buy and ask "Hey, what type of gun is that?"  I tell him that it's a BB gun, and I seem to have a rabbit infestation, as I just saw 20 run by, so I'm going to reduce the population a bit.  He chuckled, and said softly "fucking rabbits" then in a normal voice, "Well, good luck with that, let me know how it turns out", then just kept on walking.

I got 3 of those fuckers btw, and they're now in my freezer.  I still have to flesh them, but they're gutted.  Yes, I'm going to eat them.   But since people seem to be so alert to even a "huuuu Im hunting wabbits" mission, I don't think a public shooting thing could or would happen here.  :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was coming back from Moscow ID buying cigarettes, and this dude pulls up next to me on the last stop light out of town and revs his engine.  I first acted like I didn't hear it, and just kept looking forward.  He revs again, so I rev back, and did a stand on my brakes, and revved up to 3000 RPM.  Light turns green, so I let off of my brakes, and smoke his ass all the way to all of 60.  He keeps on going, and makes it to Pullman sooner than I do by 2 min.  But he's stuck at a stoplight that I just rolled up to, (and I didn't have to stop because I timed it right), so I passed him at 35 MPH.  

He gets on his gas again, and floors it.  He swerves off to a side road, and I just think he's a moron for wanting to race under the conditions.  I wasn't even trying to race the prick, but it seems he thought that I wanted to because I did race him to 60, (the legal speed limit), before backing off.  Stupid idiot didn't clue it I stopped when I reached 60, and kept on trying to race me.

Why are people so damned stupid when it's obviously  no condition to be doing a street race?  Racing is dangerous enough, so what compels them to do it in excessively dangerous situations?  That guy in the white blazer is a damned idiot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am introverted by nature, but the (thankfully few), times where I've had to respond to a legit emergency, I seemed to take charge of the situation and even go to the extent of directing traffic until EMS arrived, The other time, I saw a guy hit a deer and almost total his rig.  I kept on going for a little bit, but then decided "I should chek if that guy's even alive, and went 90 back to the schene of the accident.  I pulled up on people crying, and so I took charge and ended up having to shoot a deer with my handgun.  There's no way in hell that I would do this in normal circumstancces.

(I flipped off a bird when i it it , (going too fastt, and the collision made me spill my coffee on my nuts)  I just kept on going.  But in an emergent situation, I seem to stop, and take power within the fullest of my ability.  Why? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Back in 96, I crossed into canada on a band trip.  I got asked 3 questions:  

1.  Do you have any weapons in the vehicle?  (my knife)
1b.  OK, do you have any firearms in the vehicle?  (no)

2.  How long to you plan to be in Canada?  (a week, I want to go to the Edmonton Mall, and I play the bass drum in the percussion section, I'm on a band trip).

3.  Business or pleasure?  (pleasure)

On re-entry into the USA, I got asked one question:

1.  Are you a lawful resident of the USA? (yes)

It was easy to cross international borders then.  Now, I need a passport, and documentation to prove that I'm legally in the USA to even leave, let alone get back.  It's fucking retarded.  Back in 96, I TRIED to show my ID, and they had me put it away, and said "verbally, are you authorised to be in the United States?" I responded, Uh, yeah?  Why else would I be on this bus?  The INS guy just shook his head and said "You'd be surprised", and kept on moving down the line.  

We almost got stopped because we had a russian immigrant aboard, and I'm glad we didn't, because I bought a CO2 pistol in Canada, and was smuggling it across international boundaries.  And some chew too. :)  

But these days, I can't even go to Canada, (or reenter the USA legally), without a passport or an EDL.

**EDIT:** It seems like we're becoming the USSR, and employing the exact same practices we used to ridicule them for.  I guess "Welcome to the USSA:  Land of the Fee, Home of the Slave." </TEXT>

I realistically will never install it in my vehicle again, but I don't want to get rid of it because it cost me over $500 back in 1999. I want to hook it up to my home audio system. How would I go about doing this? It's just the speaker, not amplified. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a budget of $100. I need to be able to pick up QAM and ATSC TV. Also NTSC, as there is 1 repeater here that still broadcast in NTSC, and the local cable system (basic service), is analog still. What is the best tuner that I can get for under $100? I have money now, so I want a decent tuner for under $100. Antenna isn't really an option here, according to my TV Fool report: www dot tvfool dot com /?option=com_wrapper Itemid=29 q=id%3df1f0978977115 e]. I want ATSC capabilities because I might some day move to an area where I can pick up OTA signals, and an NTSC tuner because we still have an analog cable system here for Extended basic service.

<TEXT> Surround baltimore with concentra wire, and make it a "no-go" zone. Ban the media from entering because of "security reasons". Cut the phone lines, power, and water. Disable cellular service, and internet access. Don't respond to any emergencies, and let the place burn down. Close down the hospitals. Nothing gets in or out except for food, which will be air dropped once a day in the form of MRE's. Let it burn. Because of the scum there, that city would shortly turn into a 3rd world hell hole making Mogadishu look like Disney World. They hate police and emergency responders? Fine. Let's see how well they get along without them at all. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Slow-moving vehicle to pull off roadway.](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.61.427)

Why does this need to be a law? If you're holding up traffic, PULL OVER! NOT HARD PEOPLE! (queue flashback to 2002 when I threw an engine rod on the Lewiston Hill, and drove in the shoulder, called my mom because my engine blew up, pissed in my radiator just to make it to WA state line to shut off my engine). 

Fuck. If you're holding up traffic, PULL OVER! The Lewiston hill is beautiful at 7MPH, and it takes about an hour to get up it, even flagged by the state bull.  Let them pass, keep on your way, and only get back in the lane once you let everybody by, (optimally, just drive on the shoulder).

<TITLE> Is it legal to operate an electric scooter without a license in WA? </TITLE>

<TEXT> I ask because my DL is about to expire, and I honestly can't afford the renewal fee.  I know I can operate a Moped on a standard DL, but what if I can't afford to renew it?  Can I run an electric scooter legally?  Yes, I will wear a helmet.  

If it's faster than a bike, I wear a helmet, (even if only a bike helmet).  I got saved once by a helmet, and I'm not riding anything that has power behind it without one).  But if I can't afford to renew my license/registration, can I get on my scooter and go to work?

I'l keep off of the public highways when I can, but if there's no sidewalk or shoulder, then I'll keep in the right lane.  Do I need one of those orange triangles on my back, (because I'm going less than 35).  No, I'm not getting on the interstate. </TEXT>

I was a few counties over in Shoshone county. I damned near shit a brick because a DAMNED PLANE ALMOST LANDED ON ME!  That dude scared the fucking shit out of me.  I heard a "WUNK" on my roof, so I backed off, (what the fuck was that?) then I hear the plane again, and it touches down. 

 HOLY SHIT!  DOWNSHIFT!  DROP THE CLUTCH, NEURAL! 911!  OH FUCK  I'M GONNA KILL THIS GUY!  OH SHIT!  I stopped 30 yards back.  Then I'm on the phone after I see if the guy is still alive.  Scary shit!  STAY NEXT TO THE PLANE!  STAY STILL!  Turns out he ran out of gas, and had to land, so he just went for the nearest highway, and he accidently tried landing on me.  After he hit my roof, he took another pass, (faster), and landed ahead.  WTF?

<TEXT> Since tasers are LTL options, (like I as a civillian have the option of pommelling you with my knife, or turning it around and spearing you with it, and after that drawing a gun and stopping you), but if I pommeled a person to stop a threat, (Ideally I don't want to get that close if I have to use it), I would be arrested if I hit somebody in the temple and accidently killed them even if it was self-defense.  Then released because if I'm drawing a weapon and was using proper escalation of force, then no charges filed in WA state).

But what happens if a cop pulls a taser, uses it, and the guy drops dead?  Would an investigation occur?  I personally won't pull anything on anybody unless I intend on using it, and am pretty sure I might have to. </TEXT>

I spun around and was about ready to deck the guy because I though somebody was going to rob me, but I stopped once I recognized that it's a cop, and not somebody going to rob/assault me.  So why did he feel the need to mildly restrain me, to risk getting punched in the face?  

Once I saw it was a city officer, I stood down, but I thought it was some random dude trying to stop me from getting away from the several mortars about ready to shoot off.  He should have shouted over his bull horn, eh?

He asked me if I owned this road, and told him "no, but nobody else is using it eh?  so I'm setting off fireworks."  He stood there and watched the fireworks with me, then ran my background info, then told me not to set off fireworks in a public roadway.

  Then he told me to pack up my shit and go to the parking lot if I'm intent on setting off fireworks, so I did.  He shook his head, and took off. </TEXT>

<TITLE> How do police decide to not stop a vehicle, and instead just get out of the way? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-04 13:47:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> While driving down the road, how do police decide to not stop somebody going VERY FAST (2-3 times the speed limit, running lights (reasonably safely, but emergently) , and blaring his horn and having on the 4 ways while flashing his high beams), Is it because he's on the phone to 911 and talking to dispatch as it happens "live", or some other reason?

When my wife cut her hand on a stupid-ass soup can, I was honestly faster than the ambulance, so "get in my truck and buckle up.  We're hauling ass".  After she got in my rig, I went 65 through town through 20 zones, and police actually got out of my way.  

I was heading the most direct rout for the hospital that I possibly could, and had my 4 ways on and was jumping lights.  I think it was pretty damned obvious that it was an emergency, ( I normally don't drive like that,  eh?)  But they knew to get out of my way and close down intersections somehow.  Is it because I was on the phone to dispatch ( 911 ), while I was rushing to the hospital as fast as I felt safe going?  

No, I didn't jump lights if it was unsafe, but if there was a gap, I did the left, right forward?  CLEAR  thing?  While I ran several lights, and wouldn't have stopped until the hospital, (then surrendered, because somebody bleeding to death on me), everybody (including several emgergency vehicles were just getting out of my way.  About half way there, I got a lead rig and a pilot rig.  How did they know that I needed a police escort when all I gave on the phone was present location, description of the vehicle, license plate number, and direction of heading?  How the fuck did the cops know not to stop me, clear the roads, and take me to the hospital? </TEXT>

<TEXT> How does one adopt non-local vernacular?  I've adopted several sayings, and I honestly have no clue where I got them from.  I'm a native to Eastern WA, (Whitman County).  I've managed to pick up the following words and I don't know how or why:

Buggy = "shopping cart"

Y'all = "You all / you guys / you"

Eh? = "Huh? / what? / right? / yeah?"

Sup = "What's up?"

Pillock = "Dick"

Arse = "ass"

Thank god I didn't adopt "cunt", or "hoser", eh? 

Sorry if this a "shit post", (whatever the hell that is), but I don't know where else to ask this.

And why don't people know what a buggy is?  I don't get it.  "shopping cart" now sounds dumb to me. </TEXT>

He was talking about how much shit he can fit in his buggy, and I was getting confused, so I said "buggy?  you mean that thing that you do this with in stores?", (did the buggy shoving gesture).  He then tried to describe what he meant, but I still had to guess.  I had no clue what he was talking about for about 3 min, until I asked, "like a rock crawler?" </TEXT>

<TEXT> In WA, I don't think I can conceal my ka-bar, (because of the "dangerous weapons" law, but in ID, I can, so long as I have an ID LCCW, or WA CPL.  I called the police, and while I can open carry basically anything I want, I can't "Furtively" carry any dangerous weapon, (except pistol since I'm licensed to do so).  So why the law difference?

Also, is it a good idea to inform, even though I don't have to?  I got in a collision back in 2012, and an officer responded.  After asking for DL/reg/ins, 

I gave him all the paperwork, and also gave him my CPL, and told him that "Since I'm armed today, here is my CPL."  He just looked at it, asked me where it as, and said "cool, if you don't touch yours, I won't touch mine."  I didn't care, but I felt like I should inform the officer even if I legally don't have to. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I tried to replace the front glass, (not very sucessfull).  I got the front glass off, but the LCD was still stuck to the screen, even after heating it up with a hair dryer.  at first, none of the buttons except for power and volUp and VolDn were working, so I took apart the phone completly, (MB, and screen/bezel assembly as one unit) and noticed that a connecter came loose on the touch screen link to the lower buttons.  

I got the home, menu, and back buttons to work again, but I still can't use the touch screen at all.  It simply doesn't recognize input.  Is there a way to fix the touch screen?  It displays everything fine, but input via touch is now impossible.  Is there a connecter that I may have missed?  I would like to not spend $71 if I don't have to buy a new front screen/bezel assembly.

**EDIT:**  Well, now that I tore it apart again, and put it back together, the phone won't turn on at all.  :(  Fuck.  Now it looks like I'm going to have to buy one. :(  I'm now back to my backup phone, which is a i997 flashed with CM11 (unofficial) 4.4.4.  Do you think I EMPed it by accident? Even plugging it in, it won't signify charging at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Example:  We got in WWII because of the Jewish holocaust.

No, we didn't.  We didn't even recognize them until 1943, when the war machine was starting to lose support, so it was revealed to the American public about execution camps, so we must fight the evil. The USA actually turned back Jewish refugees in 1938, because we didn't want them either.  (Source:  http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005267 ) 

We REALLY got involve in WWII because we embargoed the japs for oil, so we got struck in the territory of HI, so we declared war on them.  Then, since JP was allied with GE, they declared war on us.  Boom!  WWII.  The rest is history as we know it.

Anyhow, how do these modern propaganda stories get passed down as fact, when they are incredibly wrong, and why do people believe it, when even a modicum of research would prove it wrong? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Such as on American TV, they can't even say "piss", "shit" "damned", "hell", or "bastard" without getting bleeped out, and if you say "the lord's name in vain in public, you'll get dirty looks.

But on British TV that I watch, (yes, it's BBC News, and BBC America), they don't seem to care at all.  They'll use them all day long, and nobody gives a shit.  Australlian TV is even more liberal.  They even include the heavy cuss words like "fuck" and "cunt".

So what's up with the cultural differences?  Why are Americans so puritanicall with language, and don't seem to realize that saying "gosh dang it" is just G rated substitution for "god damn it", and "Shut the front door!" is a substitute for "Shut the fuck up!"?  Everybody knows what is being said.  But some words have magical offending properties, while others do not. 

Please explain.

(Yes, I want the cat to have her own room).  Bedrooms are typically fine with the lighting in every place I've had, but I like natural light in the kitchen and bathroom.  (save on energy bills).  It must be pet friendly.  Are there apartments like that around here?  I have one cat.  

Glendimier would suit me, but I don't like that the bathroom doesn't appear to have a fart fan, or any natural lighting, and the kitchen doesn't have any natural lighting.  What options do I have around here? </TEXT>

It's like they design it for people who don't know what the hell they are doing, and have no realistic expectations of speed.

They need to crank up the response time of those machines. I hate going slow in the checkout lane. Cashiering at WM has taught me how to haul ass doing it, and having to slow down because the machine can't keep up is annoying! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Looking for a new job. No I didn't get canned. I still have the job for as long as I want it, (realistically). I'm just getting tired of the irregular shifts, the inadequate hours, having to schedule myself, and dumb-ass customers who don't know where a buggy is even if I hit them in the ass with it. I've filled out a job app, and I'm wanting out of WM.

If I had 40+ per week, with a regular schedule, and didn't have to do 5 GOD DAMNED JOBS just to get SOMETIMES CLOSE to 40 hours a week, If I didn't have to work 6 days a week, and if I didn't have an irregular schedule, I would LOVE WM! But all of those things haven't happened, so I'm looking for new work.

If I'm successful in getting the job that I'm now applying for, I will like it better than WM. I'll be working M-F, with a REGULAR SCHEDULE and A REGULAR WEEKEND! I WANT THIS JOB! I'm getting sick of retail. Realistically, I'm getting tired of the shitty work situation. I'll give them a 3 week's notice, because I want to finish out my schedule, and give them adequate time to hire my replacement.

To quit immediately would be rude, and I would burn more bridges than it's worth. If I do get this job, it will be the first job I quit in my adult life, instead of getting fired from it. I just want out. I want a regular job, with a regular schedule, doing a regular job. I'm tired of working 5 jobs at 1 employer just to get CLOSE to 40 hours. I also miss O/T. Can't do that at WM!

A lot has changed in 10 years. The last time I worked at WM, I could put in 70 hour weeks, and nobody cared. Now, if I get 40.03 hours, I get a verbal warning to watch the clock. Can't do it. Can't work over 40, or I get my ass chewed. Sick of it. I want out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not to keep people in, but to keep people out.  There is a 1KM wide "No Man's Land", and there are landmines, attack dogs, automatically firing machine guns hooked up to motion sensors, armed drones, and border guards are told to "take no prisoners, but shoot on site any intruders".  We use the technology developed by the DDR and current DMZ in Korea to make an impenetrable border. </TEXT>
