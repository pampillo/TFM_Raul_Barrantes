<TITLE> The new noise just before the nexus blows up needs changing... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-10 12:44:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Since the last patch, every time the nexus blows up there's a new explosion noise played.

Here's my plight with the new sound; I play a lot of Zed and at the end of a game, just before we're about to win and blow up the nexus i like to quickly type "/j" (the joke emote) in which Zed says "Forbidden shadow wins!". HOWEVER since the new explosion noise has been added to the nexus blowing up, it muffles Zed's voice! This is absolutely game breaking

Riot i will be writing a strongly worded letter to your player support team each day until this is fixed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't see why they restricted themselves so much after BL1 with these weapons types restricted so heavily by their manufacturer. Lets face it every torgue assault rifle is the same. Every Hyperion sniper rifle is the same and so on. 

We want innovation. We want to see Torgue sniper rifles and Jakobs rocket launchers and just generally more variety within all weapon types no? </TEXT>

Diabetes sucks, I wouldnt be here if i hadnt gotten diagnosed when i did, not because of the diabetes itself but because of the depression it caused. If you're depressed, peeing a lot, drinking a lot, get cramps, etc then get it checked out you could have type 1. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recently bought a new 140mm fan for my PC to replace the old noisey one. The one i removed was one that simply connects to my PSU, the one i installed has a 4 pin pwm connector that i plugged into my motherboard.

Installation was simple enough, booted up my pc and the fan i had just install was spinning pretty slow. So i opened my PC up again, unplugged it, vacantly gawped at it and as im not a hardware kinda guy just plugged it back in assuming it was just some weird one off issue.

and BOOM the new fan started running much faster, was definately shifting some air about, however now a different fan, an old 120mm fan was now rotating much slower when before it would move some serious air just fine.

So what's the issue here because ive searched online and found nothing, is it a problem with my PSU?? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-06-02 12:54:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I truly hope i never see flying mounts in WildStar. As a long time WoW player, before flying mounts were introduced, traveling was exciting! You had to be careful not to aggro mobs or perhaps fight your way through areas, you got to see other players along the way and see the monsters they were fighting, you had to meander your way through the environment and sometimes you'd discover hidden, tucked away NPCs and villages you never knew existed before. It made the game feel alive!

Once flying mounts were added the game felt so stale when traveling, you saw a few mountains and poorly rendered villages below that you quickly glided over in a straight line, trying to get from A to B in the fastest way possible. It was boring!

So please Carbine, never add flying mounts, keep traveling as fun as possible. </TEXT>

The story is BL1 is SERIOUSLY BAD i learn almost nothing playing through the game and ended up googling most of it to piece the story together. So in conclusion play which ever you like first :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I decided to get back into BL1 recently and have decided to get all the achievements, just for fun, however my lvl 61 roland save file seems to be corrupt or something, long story short, i leveled a siren, im now level 50 and have lost the will to live.

 However to get the achievement for killing Craw im gonna need to be level 61 or have someone carry me, so i was wondering if there are any kind souls out there willing to carry a level 50 noob to help me get the achievement? :P

<TEXT> Mounts! Instead of the old catch a ride system i feel the ability to mount up at any time just like you can in WoW would be really awesome.

I feel like mounts like these could fit really well into the game and it offers more charater custimization if you give the player access to rare mount skins or just rare mounts etc.
