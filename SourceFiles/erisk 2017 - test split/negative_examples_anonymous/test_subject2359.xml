<TEXT> Her comment about Ambrose beating his whores, when explaining her motivation for helping Kvothe steal back Denna's ring.  It was obviously based on personal experience.  That, and other subtle clues that she very frequently entertained males guests of, shall we say, brief acquaintance.

She also offers to sleep with Kvothe in exchange for getting into the archive, like it was a usual business tactic of hers.

EDIT: And there seems to be a bit of downvote brigading going on, for no reason.  Anyone else notice this? </TEXT>

Not particularly.  Even when Israel faced an existential threat in '67 and '73, they didn't use nukes.  They didn't use them against Iraq in the '80s.  Why expect a nation like Iran to behave any less rationally?  They don't have any use for nuclear weapons beyond pure deterrence, same as Israel, India, and Pakistan. </TEXT>

So weird that 2000 years of history is dismissed

Yes, it is weird that you're ignoring almost 2000 years of the Palestine region having a very small, non-sovereign Jewish population, while being heavily inhabited by Arabs, some of whom still live there and would like to keep the land they're currently living on. </TEXT>

Yeah, because that makes sense, when talking about gun laws.  Hey, let's talk about other, non-related stuff!

because the point of gun laws is to reduce the overall homicide rate, not just a particular type of homicide.

That's the opposite of reality.  That's like saying seat-belt laws are intended to reduce the overall mortality rate, rather than the car-crash fatality rate.  Because that's pretty fucking stupid. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  But for Texas and Virginia it was about nationalism.

What a load of complete horseshit.  Here's the declaration of secession of the state of Texas, which mentions the abolition of slavery about fifty times as the primary point of grievance:


 Texas abandoned her separate national existence and consented to become one of the Confederated Union to promote her welfare, insure domestic tranquility and secure more substantially the blessings of peace and liberty to her people. She was received into the confederacy with her own constitution, under the guarantee of the federal constitution and the compact of annexation, that she should enjoy these blessings. She was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery-- the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits-- a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time. Her institutions and geographical position established the strongest ties between her and other slave-holding States of the confederacy. Those ties have been strengthened by association. But what has been the course of the government of the United States, and of the people and authorities of the non-slave-holding States, since our connection with them? 
 
 The controlling majority of the Federal Government, under various pretences and disguises, has so administered the same as to exclude the citizens of the Southern States, unless under odious and unconstitutional restrictions, from all the immense territory owned in common by all the States on the Pacific Ocean, for the avowed purpose of acquiring sufficient power in the common government to use it as a means of destroying the institutions of Texas and her sister slaveholding States. 
 
 By the disloyalty of the Northern States and their citizens and the imbecility of the Federal Government, infamous combinations of incendiaries and outlaws have been permitted in those States and the common territory of Kansas to trample upon the federal laws, to war upon the lives and property of Southern citizens in that territory, and finally, by violence and mob law, to usurp the possession of the same as exclusively the property of the Northern States. 
 
 The Federal Government, while but partially under the control of these our unnatural and sectional enemies, has for years almost entirely failed to protect the lives and property of the people of Texas against the Indian savages on our border, and more recently against the murderous forays of banditti from the neighboring territory of Mexico; and when our State government has expended large amounts for such purpose, the Federal Government has refuse reimbursement therefor, thus rendering our condition more insecure and harassing than it was during the existence of the Republic of Texas. 
 
 These and other wrongs we have patiently borne in the vain hope that a returning sense of justice and humanity would induce a different course of administration. 
 
 When we advert to the course of individual non-slave-holding States, and that a majority of their citizens, our grievances assume far greater magnitude. 
 
 The States of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa, by solemn legislative enactments, have deliberately, directly or indirectly violated the 3rd clause of the 2nd section of the 4th article [the fugitive slave clause] of the federal constitution, and laws passed in pursuance thereof; thereby annulling a material provision of the compact, designed by its framers to perpetuate the amity between the members of the confederacy and to secure the rights of the slave-holding States in their domestic institutions-- a provision founded in justice and wisdom, and without the enforcement of which the compact fails to accomplish the object of its creation. Some of those States have imposed high fines and degrading penalties upon any of their citizens or officers who may carry out in good faith that provision of the compact, or the federal laws enacted in accordance therewith. 
 
 In all the non-slave-holding States, in violation of that good faith and comity which should exist between entirely distinct nations, the people have formed themselves into a great sectional party, now strong enough in numbers to control the affairs of each of those States, based upon an unnatural feeling of hostility to these Southern States and their beneficent and patriarchal system of African slavery, proclaiming the debasing doctrine of equality of all men, irrespective of race or color-- a doctrine at war with nature, in opposition to the experience of mankind, and in violation of the plainest revelations of Divine Law. They demand the abolition of negro slavery throughout the confederacy, the recognition of political equality between the white and negro races, and avow their determination to press on their crusade against us, so long as a negro slave remains in these States. 
 
 For years past this abolition organization has been actively sowing the seeds of discord through the Union, and has rendered the federal congress the arena for spreading firebrands and hatred between the slave-holding and non-slave-holding States. 
 
 By consolidating their strength, they have placed the slave-holding States in a hopeless minority in the federal congress, and rendered representation of no avail in protecting Southern rights against their exactions and encroachments. They have proclaimed, and at the ballot box sustained, the revolutionary doctrine that there is a 'higher law' than the constitution and laws of our Federal Union, and virtually that they will disregard their oaths and trample upon our rights. 
 
 They have for years past encouraged and sustained lawless organizations to steal our slaves and prevent their recapture, and have repeatedly murdered Southern citizens while lawfully seeking their rendition. 
 
 They have invaded Southern soil and murdered unoffending citizens, and through the press their leading men and a fanatical pulpit have bestowed praise upon the actors and assassins in these crimes, while the governors of several of their States have refused to deliver parties implicated and indicted for participation in such offenses, upon the legal demands of the States aggrieved. 
 
 They have, through the mails and hired emissaries, sent seditious pamphlets and papers among us to stir up servile insurrection and bring blood and carnage to our firesides. 
 
 They have sent hired emissaries among us to burn our towns and distribute arms and poison to our slaves for the same purpose. 
 
 They have impoverished the slave-holding States by unequal and partial legislation, thereby enriching themselves by draining our substance. 
 
 They have refused to vote appropriations for protecting Texas against ruthless savages, for the sole reason that she is a slave-holding State. 
 
 And, finally, by the combined sectional vote of the seventeen non-slave-holding States, they have elected as president and vice-president of the whole confederacy two men whose chief claims to such high positions are their approval of these long continued wrongs, and their pledges to continue them to the final consummation of these schemes for the ruin of the slave-holding States. 
 
 In view of these and many other facts, it is meet that our own views should be distinctly proclaimed. 
 
 We hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various States, and of the confederacy itself, were established exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity; that the African race had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race, and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable. 
 
 That in this free government *all white men are and of right ought to be entitled to equal civil and political rights* [emphasis in the original]; that the servitude of the African race, as existing in these States, is mutually beneficial to both bond and free, and is abundantly authorized and justified by the experience of mankind, and the revealed will of the Almighty Creator, as recognized by all Christian nations; while the destruction of the existing relations between the two races, as advocated by our sectional enemies, would bring inevitable calamities upon both and desolation upon the fifteen slave-holding states. 
 
 By the secession of six of the slave-holding States, and the certainty that others will speedily do likewise, Texas has no alternative but to remain in an isolated connection with the North, or unite her destinies with the South. 
 
 For these and other reasons, solemnly asserting that the federal constitution has been violated and virtually abrogated by the several States named, seeing that the federal government is now passing under the control of our enemies to be diverted from the exalted objects of its creation to those of oppression and wrong, and realizing that our own State can no longer look for protection, but to God and her own sons-- We the delegates of the people of Texas, in Convention assembled, have passed an ordinance dissolving all political connection with the government of the United States of America and the people thereof and confidently appeal to the intelligence and patriotism of the freemen of Texas to ratify the same at the ballot box, on the 23rd day of the present month. 
 
 Adopted in Convention on the 2nd day of Feby, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one and of the independence of Texas the twenty-fifth.

Your slavery-apologia revisionism is a disgrace to America. </TEXT>

Well, I guess either both I and 230 years of Supreme Court decisions are wrong, or someone who can't handle basic logic is wrong.  I mean, the Tenth Amendment relies upon assuming states being part of the existing federal framework.  What's so fucking hard to understand about that? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  how does signing it mean you can never quit? Please cite this for me.

Because there's no mechanism for doing so.  It's a binding contract with no escape clause.

It actually specifically LIMITS federal power. It puts states rights OUTSIDE of federal jurisdiction.

Uh, yes.  But that federal jurisdiction is explicitly stated to exist in the first place.  The Tenth Amendment empirically acknowledges that states are a part of a larger federal framework.  Your argument undermines itself. </TEXT>

Tenthers are particularly stupid.  The Tenth Amendment doesn't validate either nullification or secession - it just says that the state can make laws, within the boundaries of federal jurisdiction.  You know, *within*, not *outside of*. </TEXT>

The Pannion Seer was a creature of pure pain, and he wanted to spread pain and suffering for its own sake.

 What was the point of Ruthald and his Cursed Sword?

We don't particularly know, but it doesn't seem relevant.

 Who were the Strangers (the Jade things in the Sky)

The souls of the Crippled God's people, coming to find him and drag him back to their world.

 What happened on the Moon?

Some of the Jade Giants ran into it, destroying it.

 Why did the other gods destroy the Fallen God?

Why not?  They had their spheres of influence, and he was encroaching.

 Why did the fallen god and the other gods become friends?

An alliance of mutual interest - he wanted to leave, and they wanted him gone.

 What did the Fallen God do to the Otataral Dragon?

Nothing - that was Heboric, re-chaining the Otataral Dragon.

 Why did the Fallen God get stabbed in the back by Cotollion?

Presumably because he couldn't leave in his corporeal form, and had to be freed from a physical body.

 Who was trying to kill the Bridgburners? Tayschern turned out to be innocent.

The politics are muddled, but it wasn't so much the Bridgeburners as Whiskeyjack, whom the Empress viewed as a rival power.  Tayschrenn just wasn't good at court politics.

 Why were Mallic Rel   friend get spared and become emperor?

Mallick Rel had corrupted the Claw, and his version of the Fall at Aren prevailed, making him out to be the hero.  Laseen couldn't compete with his influence.

These are just the questions off the top of my head, the author never explains anything and now he is selling more books? its just signs of a poor writer.

He hurried on, grimacing at the ache in his chest, still feeling the parting kiss of his wife on his lips, the careless hugs of his children round his waist.

He was a man who would never ask for sympathy.  He was a man who sought only to do what was right.  Such people appear in the world, every world, now and then, like a single refrain of some blessed song, a fragment caught on the spur of an otherwise raging cacophony.

The U.S. has about three times as many combat aircraft, so a higher raw number of accidents is to be expected.

<TEXT>  At least that's what Palosczi-Horvath writes in his Krushchev biography, it's an old book and maybe there's better scholarship nowadays.

You'll want to read William Taubman's *Khrushchev* (2003), then.  The secret speech was the results of months of research instigated by Khrushchev, and largely written by him with help from a few others.  Written and re-written, and passed around the Presidium before it was delivered (by a day or two). Malenkov didn't seem to figure into it, and was already well on his way down, with the attempted coup sort of his last gasp. </TEXT>

He came across as too perfectly naive, and did so in a way that kept upping the ante.  Like his earlier acts didn't work, so he had to lay it on a bit thicker before Denna helped him.

A right would be the freedom from being forced into not being able to own them. Like the Nazis did to the Jews under the Third Reich ect

Either I make:  

Quickly boiled rotini (cold pasta is best with a bit of bite); mixed with shredded deli-sliced ham, pepperoncinis, kalamata olives, red onion, feta cheese, salt, pepper, and a bit of mayo for a sauce.

or 

Udon noodles, finely chopped green onions, chicken or fried tofu, shredded cabbage, slivered almonds, and a dressing of sesame   peanut oil, soy sauce, crushed or powdered ginger, powdered garlic, lemon juice, rice vinegar, and fine-ground white pepper. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are a bunch of towns mentioned as being near Newarre (Rannish   Baedn, for example), and a few mentioned as being near the bandit camp (Crosson, etc.), but no overlap.  The map found in the bandit camp also seems to imply a great deal of distance from any town, unlike the short walk Bast takes to get to the lightning tree.

There's a greystone near the lightning tree, which Kvothe would be sure to notice at some point when dealing with the bandits.  And, most importantly, the lightning tree is on a hill, the bandit camp was in a small valley (a "bowl" as Kvothe describes it).

There's just nothing to connect to the two. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  He may well be Vashet's poet-king.

Vashet specifically says that her poet-king was from the Small Kingdoms.  I think Kvothe kills both Ambrose *and* Roderic - the first gains his reputation as a "poet killer," the second his reputation as a "King-killer."  

The fact that Ambrose is a shitty poet doesn't matter.  Plenty of ass-kissers will likely play up his talent, making him into some kind of gifted poet. </TEXT>

I didn't say he *caught* it, I said he was poisoned.  The fact that he's not an alchemist would make it that much easier.

And the Medica would recognize denner resin poison, the sickness from which wouldn't last day after day.  From Wil and Sim's description of alchemy, the Medica can't really do much about the nastier or more subtle stuff. </TEXT>

The U.S. negotiated and signed disarmament treaties with the Soviet Union, a nation that was literally arming other countries fighting and killing American soldiers, a nation that had tens of thousands of nuclear warheads aimed at us.

But the modern Republican betwetting, pants-shitting, sociopathing neocons are blind to history.  They only know that the scary Kenyan Muslim darkie who stole the White House thanks to ACORN is bowing down to Tehran and gifting the Ayatollah with the nukes he'll use to destroy the 51st American state of Israel by ... negotiating to delay Iran's nuclear weapons program.  Or something.  It apparently doesn't have to make sense, outraging Republicans is now as simple as not killing funny-talking brown people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, it was worse than that for the Soviets.  At this time, the U.S. had about 220 ICBMs, the Soviets ... 4, 2 of which were experimental.  As well, the U.S. had 9 SSBNs in service, with the rather capable Polaris 1A SLBM (range of 1000 miles), while the Soviets had a haphazard scattering of converted subs with short ranged missiles that had to be launched from the surface.  That, and all the IRBMs that the U.S. had stationed in NATO countries very close to the Soviet border, whereas the Soviets just had whatever they'd installed in Cuba.  

The only nukes likely to get through to the U.S. would've been the ones launched from Cuba, and those probably only would've been used if they were in the process of being bombed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can actually see how some of them might not be - Hemme, Brandeur, Lorren, Herma, and to a lesser extent Arwyl wouldn't need to be full arcanists to run their departments.  

They could've attended the University when they were younger, learning certain basic principles, then went out into the world and attained great stature and fame in their respective fields, then be brought back by the University to be Masters teaching in those fields.  Naming, Artificing, Sympathy, and Chemistyr/Alchemy would of course require a full arcanist's level of talent and knowledge.  

But Archiving, Rhetoric   Logic, Mathematics, Linguistics, and perhaps Medicine ... these are things where the rest of the Four Corners might offer just as much opportunity for learning and accomplishment as the University.  Someone like Chronicler could potentially be brought back as Master Archivist after another twenty years of gaining repute, for example. </TEXT>

Which is probably very, very deliberate on someone's part.  I wouldn't be surprised if Fae children are raised with these stories to keep them from seeking out the Cthaeh.  It probably really can see almost everything, which makes it dangerous to talk to - so, you'd want to discourage that, by really amping up what it's capable of.  The Sithe probably know that the Cthaeh doesn't actually know the future, but the fact that it knows everything in the present is bad enough.

<TITLE> Adding a bit more bite to my Caesar Dressing? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-28 03:28:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm wondering how to gain that store-bought *sharpness* to my home-made Caesar dressing.  That sort of bite that a lot of bottled brands have, but that I just can't reproduce.

Anyways, numbers are real rough (eyeballed mostly), and I usually lay it on the heavy side with seasonings:

Mayo (store bought), 2 cup

Anchovie paste, 2 tbsp

Worcestershire Sauce 2 tbsp

Lemon Juice, 1 tsp

White vinegar, 1 tsp

Crushed garlic, 1 tbsp

Onion powder, 1 tsp

Salt, 1 tsp

Pepper, 1/2 tsp


But while it doesn't lack *flavor* (which is usually great), per se, it lacks that bite on the tongue.  It's just ... a bit too smooth and creamy.  I'm not looking to add heat, mind, so definitely not peppers/hot sauce, unless that's definitely the thing to do.  And I'm not looking to make a vinaigrette. Any possible suggestions?  Even maybe MSG?  I've thought about using plain Greek yogurt instead of mayo, but that's a bit expensive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I suspect there are two reasons:

1.)  The people involved are long past punishment.  Either dead, or no longer in the University.  For example, the frame seems to be about seven or eight years after the WMF narrative.  Sim, Wil, and Fela are no doubt long passed through the University, so can't be hurt by punitive action (there's also the possibility that some or all of them are dead, but I have my reasons for not believing this is true).  Riem's no doubt long retired, or he turned on Kvothe and deserves to be ratted out.  Elodin's pretty unlikely to give a damn about the other Masters' opinion, and they may even be amused that he burned Hemme's rooms.  Auri very likely has moved on, with her story having a conclusion that the world should be told about.  And what else has he told that really matters?

Also, keep in mind that he hasn't really given anything away about the Ademre that an astute observer couldn't figure out for themselves.  He doesn't really actually describe how they fight, and even if he did, what could you learn from words on paper that compares to years and years of excruciating, devoted training?  If anything, he enhances their reputation, by explaining that for all his talent and reputation, he barely studied amongst them, and barely touched on their abilities.

2.) There may be some secrets he just doesn't give a damn about giving away.  The Maer's arcanist trying to kill him?  Maybe that doesn't deserve to be a protected secret.    The Chandrian need to be told about.  Felurian will never know, and would be flattered anyways.  So ... who is being betrayed?  What secrets don't earn airing? </TEXT>

<TITLE> KCC stories drawn from real life. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-12 06:54:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There are a few anecdotes in the KKC (more specifically AWMF) that Rothfuss drew on from real history, and in both cases French 18th Century history:

1.) Kvothe makes a joke to Denna in Severen about a certain lady losing her virginity in a theater box.  This is based on Julie de Lespinasse, who *actually did* lose her virginity (aged 42) in a Parisian opera box in 1770, to Comte Jacques-Antoine de Guibert.  She confirms this - or at least *claims* this - in letters to him.

2.) Fela's "Interesting Things" story about blind people who have their site restored, and have to be taught how to identify shapes by looking at them. To quote Will Durant from "The Age of Voltaire":

"[Diderot] was especially attracted by a question which the Irishman William Molyneux had raised about 1692: Will a man born blind who has learned to distinguish a cube from a sphere by touch, be able, if his sight is restored, to differentiate at once a cube from a sphere, or will he require, before he can make this distinction, some experience of the relations between forms touched and the same forms seen?  The latter answer had been given by Molyneux and his friend [John] Locke.

"In 1728 Willian Cheselden operated successfully upon a fourteen-year-old boy who had been blind from birth; the boy had to be trained before he could differentiate forms by sight alone."


I'd also note that 18th Century French history, as well as 16th   17th Century Renaissance history, is filled with the sort of polymathic geniuses that, if they only existed in fiction, would be decried as Mary Sues/Gary Stus.  

You know ... like Kvothe, but without the benefit of living in a world with true magic to become brilliant at.  If sympathy   sygaldry existed in the real world, men like Benjamin Franklin and Voltaire would've been the Kvothes of our history.  Can you imagine Leonardo di Vinci getting his hands on sygaldry? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Part of the problem is that some counties cover a very wide range of altitudes.  This is especially obvious in eastern California - some of those narrow east-west counties start at 1-200 feet, and top out at anywhere from 6-10,000.

Colusa County, for example, is the Sacramento Valley, with a low point of about 45', and a high point of 7,055; Placer County goes from 145' to more than 9000', the high end being in the rather snowy (most years) Tahoe region.  </TEXT>

First, when Kvothe, Sim, and Wil were demonstrating sympathy to Denna, Kvothe as narrator says that she had never seen sympathy before. Except she had, in Trebon, when he lit that shingle on fire.

Second, when in Severen, Denna mocks him for even mentioning the Chandrian, when she was fully on-board - at length - in Trebon in wondering what the Chandrian were up to. Unless she's completely amnesiac about literally everything that happened in Trebon, this makes no sense.

Third, Mola didn't recognize Auri in NotW, when she should have according to what we're told in WMF: that all the girls at the University live in the same wing of the Mews, and all know each other. Mola's been there for about five years, Auri is apparently about twenty (give or take a year), they would've met while Auri was a student.

EDIT:  Also, Kvothe shouldn't have been surprised to learn that Sim's father was a duke.  After all, that's one of the first things he's told about Sim in NotW. </TEXT>

ICE has a tendency towards bad prose, and just throwing a bunch of things into the story without really blending them.  He covers all the plot elements required, but not smoothly. Very choppy, jumps-around type of work.  And he frequently underwhelms with his revelations of big mysteries.  Something will get hugely built up, and then when you find out the secret, it's like ... "That's it?  Seriously?" </TEXT>

<TITLE> Just looking for help for rent money, 30-day notice with ten to go, absolutely zero income. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-22 19:30:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In fact, my very patient landlord waited way past 60 days, I'm more like 90 behind, and he finally sent the 30-day notice.  Currently unemployed and worked a cash job over the summer/fall, so no UI. I've scraped up one month's rent ($350), but live in a rural area where there's just no day-work, almost no social services (I have no kids, so don't qualify for any county or state - California - help), and very very few jobs available.  If I had anything valuable to sell, I would, but I never really have.

The usual work I do in the winter is dependent upon getting snow, and we (rural NE California), well, *haven't*.  I'm not looking to raise $1000 from redditors, but literally anything would help at this point.

So I'm just sort of tossing this out there with a little more than a week left.  I just wish I was a cat who needed surgery or something - I'm not a huge sob story, just financially desperate over a bad winter.

EDIT:  PM me for Paypal details. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  But for whatever reason, that shitty pre-sliced bread is really popular in the US. 

You know ... that stuff is really, really good for a couple of things.  First:  well-buttered toast.  Generic American sliced white bread just makes really good toast.  Because I don't want an overly-strong flavor like sourdough or whatever first thing in the morning.

And second, grilled-cheese sandwiches, with the equally-derided Kraft American cheese slices on them.  Two over-priced, over-processed piles of chemicals that only vaguely resemble their namesakes, but when you put them together are so goddamn delicious.

EDIT:  I'll toss in a third thing:  Cheap grade-school sandwiches with lots of mayo.  Namely, ham-and-cheese using cheap, tangy, fatty mayo and mass-produced deli sliced ham.  Or with Oscar Meyer bologna, which probably isn't even a real meat, but with enough mayo and mustard on Wonderbread is really, really tasty. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have an old 3rd generation iPod Shuffle.  I like to load up lectures onto it to listen to while I work - problem is, once a file hits the 30 minute mark, the iPod skips to the next track.  

Is this a common thing?  Can anything be done about it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not in their own hand, of course ... but when it comes to people like Horace, Virgil, Tacitus, Cicero, etc., do we have any copies of their works that were published either in their own lifetime, or shortly after?  

Because I've always wondered if we're just relying upon copies of copies of copies of copies, and so on.  Were the humanist scholars of the 14th Century just copying Carolingian documents?  Or did they have original material from Roman and Greek times? </TEXT>

Is there something I can to do balance this out?  I was thinking spiciness to cut into the blandness - maybe some chopped jalapenos, and some Sriracha.  Other thoughts? </TEXT>

Anyways, back in the mid-80s (young people can go ahead and just leave now), a local pizza place had a billboard-style game on one wall.  It was about 6' x 3', and was played with an IR remote.  

There was a illustration of a hunter holding a shotgun standing in some reeds with a dog, and there were five cut-out positions for the shotgun.  They'd light up individually as you directed with the controller.  The ducks were also lit up sections of an otherwise black panel, and you'd have to have the gun aimed at the right angle to hit one.

Anyone else remember this? </TEXT>
