<TEXT> So I get this. Especially on my bikini line. My pediatrician told me two weeks ago, to go to the dollar store, buy the Athletes foot cream, whatever one they have, and baby powder. Apply after a shower. First the cream, then the powder. After a few days it goes away. And mine was worse than this. It also surprisingly got rid of the dark spots. Now, I'm not an expert and everyone's bodies reacts differently to things- so it is merely a remedy. I cannot promise anything but I hope that maybe it helps! 


EDIT: Make sure when you do apply these two easy steps, it is to dry skin. Try not to out on underwear right after. My suggestion would be after a shower before bed. Sleep commando.  </TEXT>

EDIT: I shouldn't say majority. But lots. Follow the traffic laws and all should be okay. Everyone rushes around here like traffic is that bad. Rush hour traffic in Toledo most you'd have to wait is an hour. Any where else- triple that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I still think Jennifer Garner is a bitch for coming into the picture when he was with JLo. And I also still think that Afleck and JLo would be together to this day if it weren't for Garner. And we all know JLo is a ride or die kind of girl (Diddy shooting stint) so when it came to Aflecks friends (Kevin Smith) I doubt she would have objected to the friendship. She probably would have been the one handing him the Zippo for his smoke seshs anyways. Garner seems like an uptight bitch. Her little winced smile like the head of a dildo is going up her ass at all times. Idk there is something about Garner.... Something is off with her.

<TEXT> My cottage in southern Ohio was build on an old Amish farm. Our lake was created by a damn, it is about 6 miles long. All the houses are in the bays of the lake. So anyways..

I was in bed one night and a little girl with long blonde hair in a white baptismal gown appeared at the foot of my bed. My younger cousin was in the room with me. When I saw her I tried to scream but no sound was coming from me. I could feel my chest getting tense. Anyways, this little girl said to me "SWIM!" after she said that she looked as if she was suffocating. I was totally spooked. Did some research and asked a few neighbors after that night if they had experienced anything. Apparently this little Amish girl drown in the lake right after the water had settled and she went from house to house warning people to not go in. 

I embrace her now since she has such a sad story but truthfully....she still scared me a little.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've always been pretty sensitive since I have been younger, honestly I know he is a good guy just territorial. 

I have always been pretty lax around my house and others, always keep things clean but I have a bad habit of leaving doors and things open, in the past he has shut them right in front of me. He's territorial and doesn't like things messed up. 

So I need to do a better job of respecting that. In the end I think he is just looking out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I'm house sitting again for my neighbors that I have previously posted about before. We did tell her father-in-law the day I arrived that I would be here and so far so good. A few subtle things like shutting doors, opening and shutting of drawers in the bed room. But nothing that has actually made me scared.

He was playing fetch with one of the dogs the other day. The dogs toy would move slowly around the room and the dog was chasing it. My mother actually witnessed this happening. She couldn't believe her eyes. 

Glad he's getting to be more comfortable around me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I slept with my best friends step dad when I was 20. He was in my college town for business. Always was attracted to him. He would always randomly hand us $100 in high school and on vacations and shit.  He was handsome, wealthy and I never really thought of him as her 'father/step father'. It happened and it was amazing. When she found out, she laughed. Said I wasn't the only one who had thought about it. But I was the only one to do it. She wasn't upset. Still isn't. We see one another weekly. I guess I got off easy. I still see him randomly, but I am in an amazing happy relationship. 


EDIT: When I said "We see one another weekly." I mean my friend. Not him. I am in a great relationship.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> From my understanding and the stories she and her husband have told me is that, he will turn on and off lights. When the kids are done playing in a room and forget to turn off a light, they would see them go off. Whenever any of their children wake up at night to use the restroom or get a glass of water, he will willingly turn on lights BEFORE they enter the room. Like he knows where they are going. 

He has never truly harmed me, just scared me a few times. I wonder what I did wrong to him because from what I am told he was a nice man. Just didn't like change. I plan on staying the whole month- because it is a vacation to me being out of my parents house. I work so much (in a restaurant so strange hours) that I leave the dogs home all day and they like the company so of course I will sleep there. 

I will just have to sit down and have a conversation with him. Let him know I mean no harm.  </TEXT>

I live in Sylvania, OH. What some people fail to mention about this cemetery is that it is in a neighborhood.  My friends and I would smoke weed out in the cemetery every once in a while. This day in particular, we hadn't smoked yet and we heard a woman weeping. We decided not to smoke and investigate instead. 

About 30 minutes in we heard a woman weeping again. Then she asked "Where are they?!' We knew right then and there it was the woman looking for her husband's. We couldn't believe it. Needless to say we all ran like chickens. Couldn't believe what we had heard. It has been about 6 years and I can still hear the voice plain as day.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Neighbors dead father-in-law </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-21 02:46:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I house sit for my across the street neighbors once a month. Typically for a weekend sometimes a couple weeks. Great money. Watch the dogs and Ghost Adventures the whole time. Since my parents live across the street I feel safe. And since my neighbors have known me for so long I sometimes will have small get togethers with my friends or my significant other.

I have mentioned in other posts that I am somewhat sensitive. Normally things with spirits don't bother me much.


 Anyways...her father-in-law passed away in the house about 15 years ago. These are bigger houses, and if you are down stairs the only way someone upstairs could hear you is if you are extremely loud. Like making a point for someone to hear you.

So my S/O was really pissing me off this night in particular. He said he was coming over but got trashed instead. I kept telling him to get a cab and come over since I was lonely and quite honestly just wanted to cuddle. That's when it all happened...

 I was upstairs in the master bedroom watching television as I was falling asleep. About an hour after I fell asleep, I was sleeping on my right side, I felt someone push me onto my back and then pull the sheets off of the bed. I stayed as calm as possible. Went downstairs to let the dogs out and smoke a cigarette. When I got down there every light was on, the stove was on and the television was on. They have an amazing security system and I never worry about break ins. Plus my handy pistol is always by my side. 

I turned everything off, smoked my cigarette, got the dogs in,
 brushed my teeth and went back upstairs. About two hours later the same thing happened again. Pushed onto my back and the sheets were pulled off the bed. 

This time I heard a very loud bang. Shook the walls a little. I flew out of bed. At this point I knew someone was in the house fucking with me. I thought it was my man being drunk and stumbling around. But being me I grabbed my pistol and checked every room upstairs and carefully made my way down stairs. No one was in the house. Every light was on. Every cabinet was open. Stove was on. Television was on. The dogs were hiding in the laundry room. I called my man and he said he was still out and that he would be over soon. I stayed up and waited for him. 

When he arrived an hour later we went upstairs and laid down. He was holding me and all of a sudden his arm was yanked off. We both lost it. I have never been so terrified in my life. I called my neighbors and told them what happened. She told me to not worry about it that I was probably just her father-in-law. That he was never a fan of other people in his house and that I should talk to him and explain that I was there to take care of the animals and the house. Make sure everything was okay and safe while his son and daughter were out of town. 


I go back next week for a month while they go to their other home in California. I'm absolutely terrified to go back. 

How can I make this right with her late father-in-law?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> University in Ohio. I've always been an herbal kind of gal. Hence TORCHHTOKE, good grades, degree, and the curiosity to dabble with other things such a shrooms and every once in a while acid. Always ending back in the dorm. (I have a great buddy system.)

My roommate on the other hand...not so smart. She started doing heroin. She came from a small town outside Cleveland. Since she lived so close she normally stayed there, eventually failing out because she missed so many classes. 

Well turned out, one day after I ate some shrooms with my gay best friend and went to a local hole in the wall bar and got decently fucked up and we walked back. Opened the door. And there is my roommate, looking like a scene from a horror movie. Wet hair covering her face squating over my coffee pot taking a shit into it. She obviously was zooted out of her mind because it took her a good minute to realize we were staring at her. She then proceeded to pick up her shit and throw it at us. 

I was boomin so hard that I started laughing then ran away. When the RA came to the room they found her laying on the bathroom floor covered in her shit. Obviously called the authorities. When our room was searched I told them exactly what I had in my drawer safe. Condoms, birth control, a 8th of shrooms and $2000. When the cop opened it up he looked at me. Tossed me my baggie of shrooms. And said "We will be searching the rest of the room now you may leave."

When I came back, sobered up a little she was arrested. Charged with some heavy shit and I never saw or spoke to her again. 


I hope she's doing okay because she had so much potential. Still stoked I got away with those shrooms. 

P.S- I have another story that is so fucked up. Maybe for later.

He ran after me asking why I wasn't fighting for him. I asked him "Why would I fight for someone who isn't faithful?" And that was it. Moved back in with my parents the next day. 

P.S- He got her pregnant. She had a baby boy, and put the child up for adoption. She said having a kid would be a burden at 19.

<TEXT> I am currently on POF. I have also labeled myself as "average" body type. I gained some weight when my kate fianc passed away. I have always been in great shape, and I am a very attractive woman. (I have been told by so many people throughout my life. No I do not have a big head.) Figured it would be good to get back into dating online and try things out. Although my body type says "average", I have lost 30+ in a few short months. I still have more to go. But by eating healthy and actually getting out of bed and starting my days makes that much of a difference- I was so depressed for the longest time. I do let the men I talk to know that I am on this journey and if they can accept me now, they will be more accepting when I reach my goal. 

I'm not telling you this to feel bad for me or anything, just sharing so you know not all "fatties" wanted to be that way. And that some of us are making the conscious effort to better ourselves.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I worked at this place called The Barn. It literally is an old red barn from the 20's and opened as a bar in 1934. Anyways, we had a regular (way before my time), whose name is Frank. He passed away about 6-7 years ago. His wife still comes in. He was a huge Captain Morgan drinker and we have his "last bottle" in a shrine/glass box. Frank was know to really dislike rap music so when we had DJ's come in he would flight glasses straight across the bar. Not just push them, as if he was throwing them. When employees, including myself, would be making a burger in the back he would tell us when to flip them. Often I would be checking an I.D of someone's and if they were. underage I would get awalsy a swift tap on on the right shoulder. We knew it was him, never failed to amaze us though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I own a trailer. Nice one. Newly renovated. Got a roommate. He was struggling with some things had him pay $250 a month in rent. Cheap. Told him no smoking in the house. He got drunk and decided he wanted to make fried chicken. Started the process and then passed out on the couch with a cigarette burning. To my surprise it wasn't the cig that caught my trailer on fire.... He burnt the chicken. Caught my stove on fire and slept threw the whole thing. I work in a bar so I was just getting home around 4 A.M when I saw the paramedics, fire trucks and police officers. He came out unscathed and moved out the. next day. While I had no place to live considering majority of my place was gone. I had to move back home with my parents. Shit sucks. 

He got his karma a few months later- got pulled over for a DUI in someone else's truck with no insurance.

EDIT: I have multiple bad roommate stories. I have always had bad luck in this department. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember switching from private to public schools...private schools everyone had brand-new art supplies. Crayons, makers, pencils, pens... This one kid in particular came from a very under privileged family.. I noticed his crayons one day, seeing that they were old and had been used a while ago. I took the money out of my piggy-bank and bought him a new pack. At the age of 7. To this day I will never forget the smile on his face when he found/opened up that new box of crayons that randomly appeared in his desk.

Try saging the house. All corners, door ways, every room including the attic. This can be done at any time, if you are more comfortable with the daylight do it then. Say something to bless the house and be rid of the spirits. Send them on their way to the actual afterlife. Another thing that I do whenever staying somewhere new, hotel, house, whatever- salt. Salt gets rid of negative energy. Windowsills, door ways and EVERY CORNER.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dear brother, 27 years you will never get back. No matter the amount of money you will receive for this it can never make up for the things you wanted and hoped for.  I feel for you and I hurt for you. May you be free to do as you please. 27 years you stared at those gray walls hoping things weren't the way they were. I am honored you are a part of this community again and I hope justice is brought to those who it is bestowed upon. 

Love from Toledo </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would love to see a picture of the bathroom. 

I'm a medium. I have spoken to the deceased for years, starting when I was about 6-7. (21/f) Not only that I'm an active member at our local paranormal group. People have brought me into their homes to try to figure out what was going on. 

You need to research the property, and surrounding areas land. You need to be sure that no one in the home has brought home any new items. 

Please be aware that even though you told this entity to leave does not mean it will not return. (I am not trying to scare you.) 

We like to say that sometimes spirits will go dormant. They do also cycle. Haunt at specific times of the year, things like that.

Please post pictures, I would love to see the dog also. 

Best of luck to you, and remember- we are never alone. We chose to see what we allow ourselves to.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was younger and played a lot of sports I had horrible acne on my back in the outline of my sports bra. One day I was trying to get rid of some of the acne and came upon this really massive bump under my skin. So I started to squeeze and squeeze, it hurt so bad. I called my mom into the bathroom and told her to get it out. Once it was fully out it was the hardest most odd looking thing just like that! It was the size of your standard pill capsul. I dropped it on the floor and it made a clinking sound. I'm assuming it was a really old blackhead built up from over the years!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Congrats! Big step for him. But do not take his showing of no interest personally ever. Although it may be hard to deal with sometimes he will get there eventually. Each child goes at their own pace.


But again congrats! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a bartender at two restaurants and nothing kills me more than this gluten free fad. I understand some people really cannot have gluten but the ones that can.....

My new response to people that ask what on our menu is gluten free I now tell them 'Sir/ma'am, anything that had a face.' </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because I had the luxury of being able to go on spring break and to play sports, granted I bought my first car and am still driving it to this day, but my parents had money when I was his age. My parents at this point both have jobs but at their age it's so difficult to find something like he had before making that amount of money. I wanted to help, I want my siblings to have a somewhat 'normal' life like I did. That's why I do what I do. It was my choice. I couldn't stand to see my family suffer anymore. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is a cyst. I'm not an esthetician or anything but have gone numerous times to get those removed, I stopped going because I love popping things so I do it myself. I pierce the skin with a sewing needle after sanitizing it and it has to go through the layer of skin and the sack the cyst is in. It will hurt. Then squeeze. The process is a little painful and if your not grossed out easily I suggest you do it yourself. Sometimes they just explode when you least expect if so I do it myself so it doesn't happen at the wrong time. Hope that helped a little.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, I was in Venezuela visiting family and this guy had taken real interest in me. My cousin was freaking out, so excited that this guy was talking to me. Surprisingly he was very fluent in English and that made me really happy. We danced on the beach, had dinner and an amazing time. One thing led to another and we ended up sleeping with each other. The next day my cousin told me who he was. Turns out he was in what we here would call a 'boy band.' South Americas Backstreet Boys. Even though I didn't know it at the time afterwards I felt an odd sense of accomplishment. Like "I just did a celebrity." Never saw him again, but did download his album off iTunes.  </TEXT>
