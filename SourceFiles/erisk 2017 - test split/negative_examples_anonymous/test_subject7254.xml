<TEXT> Yes, the USA supplied Free Syrian Army factions with Tow missiles to fight Syrian forces.

Yes, the FSA now has the name ISIS in Western media.  They are the same force.

'In February 2015, The Carter Center listed 23 groups within the Southern Front of the Free Syrian Army that have been documented using US supplied TOWs.[23]'

"But this Courts two decisions on the Act will surely be remembered through the years. The somersaults of statutory interpretation they have performed (penalty means tax, further [Medicaid] payments to the State means only incremental Medicaid payments to the State, established by the State means not established by the State) will be cited by litigants endlessly, to the confusion of honest jurisprudence. And the cases will publish forever the discouraging truth that the Supreme Court of the United States favors some laws over others, and is prepared to do whatever it takes to uphold and assist its favorites." </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is no rational reason that someone can't make it to the polls, which are usually open for 12 hours on election day, if they wish to vote.

Does it take longer than 12 hours for Democrats to travel to their neighborhood polling center?

Can you show me one documented case of someone that couldn't make it to their *neighborhood* poll in less than 12 hours of travel? 

Get up early.

Vote on your lunch break.

Vote after work. 

Vote anytime if you don't work.

Some states actually require employers to give you time off to vote!  

There is absolutely no legitimate reason for early voting.

<TEXT>  I think this would be a wonderful opportunity to pause for a moment and give thanks for the many great contributions of the Democratic-voting black community and their culture to our society.

Their peaceful and generous nature make them ideal neighbors, lending testimony to their exceptional family values and parenting skills unrivaled by any other culture.
Their commitment to academic excellence enriches our schools and serves as an example to all who hope to achieve prominence as a people.

Real estate values are fueled by the influx of African Americans into an area due to their caring and respectful nurturing of these communities, an example of all they have achieved by their enthusiasm for self improvement through hard work and a self-reliant can-do nature.

Without their industrious and creative drive, we would be poorer as a nationpresently enriching the cities of Spokane WA, Chicago IL, Philadelphia PA, Washington D.C., St. Louis MO, New Orleans LA, Los Angeles CA, Flint MI, Baltimore MD, Pontiac MI, Newark NJ, Cleveland OH, Atlanta GA, Richmond VA, Memphis TN, Birmingham AL, Camden NJ; and lets not forget Detroit, MI, the tourism capital of the world! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Congratulations.  You've found the difference in incentive betwen the government and private sector.

A business operates off its own money and thus has the incentive to perform and be accountable.

The government doesn't operate off it's own money and the employees do not have any motivation to be accountable or even perform at all.

<TEXT> All of these attacks took place in sovereign nations with responding security forces.  In these cases, unilateral intervention would be more difficult politically.  Libya, however, was in a state of civil war and unilateral action would have been the *only* security response.

Who is the only one person in the USA who can authorize military action in another nation?

Why was no rescue force ever sent while our people were in a siege and getting killed?

Why were fixed wing aircraft resting on a tarmac one hour away(Italy) never scrambled?

We did however manage to send an *unarmed* Predator.  Why did we prioritize the launch of an unarmed Predator over fixed wing assets with real bombs?

Why was the attack blamed on a video despite there being no evidence of this?

How did the White House/media know **immediately** the motivations of attackers in the middle of the night 8,000 miles away in a war torn country?  What source did they use for this?  Did they interview people?  How did they know this?

Why was a low ranking person, Susan Rice, paraded out on talk shows to blame this attack on a video?  Why not have someone that is formally in charge actually address the nation first?

TLDR: Our men fought all night long, while no one in Washington lifted a finger. The White House made up a story about a video, since this was mid-election and a terrorist attack would have been bad for Obama.

<TEXT> Anthropomorphic global warming is a farce and a political movement to undermine Western capitalist nations.

Devastating periods of climate activity are going to happen, with or without humans present. Consider the ice ages. Glaciers several kilometers thick formed and moved thousands of miles, crushing everything in their paths. There is no scientist on earth that can tell you why this occurred.  There were several interglacial periods of warming, where ice was rapidly melting.   We are probably in one of those periods now.  


Even the founder of Greenpeace stated before Congress there is no scientific evidence of anthropomorphic global warming.   

Relax, the sky's not falling. We don't need more govt control to avert another fake crisis. Sound familiar? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The only thing wrong about this article is the number.  There are 20+ million illegals in the US. Since Obama's executive amnesty and his orders to cease deportations and even apprehensions, they are pouring in.  

Third world status?

Yes we can! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Patriot Act wasn't about patriotism. It was about control.

The Affordable Care Act wasn't about affordability.  It was about control.

Net Neutrality isn't about neutrality.  It's about control.


Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was once like in the United States where men were free.
