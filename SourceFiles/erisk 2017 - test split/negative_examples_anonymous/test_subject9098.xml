<TEXT> True, but I wonder if he just says that to Marty and it's not actually true.  Otherwise, why would Doc be so confident standing in front of the Delorean while Einstein is being sent ahead 1 minute?  Doc and Marty easily could have been ran over if the experiment with Einstein failed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So at the beginning of the first movie, Marty shows up at Doc's place and all of the clocks are being shown.  While Marty is talking to Doc on the phone the clocks all ring 8:00 am and Doc says "That means my experiment worked".  Referring to the clocks all being 25 minutes slow.  What experiment is Doc referring to in regards to the clocks?  Did he possibly time travel already himself?  If he already time traveled, then that would make sense that he knows Marty will be at his place at that time.  Otherwise, why would Doc call his own home if there shouldn't be anyone there to answer? </TEXT>

Concession stands and small games to play.  Drivers talking and some autographs.  They didn't have anything extra opened up for the garage area or shop/museum though.  We actually had to park in one of the lots for the track and they bussed people in and out of the place since there wouldn't have been room for parking there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As lawnmower_of_destiny said, compared to other generations, the gap isn't that large.  PS2 was at 150M+, compared to GC and Xbox both in the lower 20M range.  PS1 was just over 100M compared to N64 with just 33M.  SNES compared to Genesis is a bit closer at 49M to 29M.  But regardless if you look at the percentages of sales, the Wii over PS3 and X360 is considerably smaller than any of the previous 3 generations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Where are you buying enough oil for a vehicle for under $10?  Quarts of oil are over $3 a piece.  And pretty much any vehicle requires 4-5 quarts.  Even if you buy the larger 5 quart container it isn't much savings.  Either way, I'm agreeing with you that it isn't worth doing it yourself for the price it can be done at a store.  Maybe a $5 savings by doing it yourself for most vehicles with standard oil. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Over the past 2 years I've lost just under 40 pounds with just exercising and not changing my diet.  I'd say I've been averaging about 25-30 miles per week running and 45 minutes of weights 3-4 days a week.  Of course changing up my diet would have sped up the weight loss process, but I didn't want to have to change up my eating and drinking habits in order to lose the weight.  So it is possible to lose weight without eating less, but it will take longer to get to your goals. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-05-30 17:20:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been running for several years and around last October I initially began increasing my speed for short periods during one run a week.  This turned into a sort of interval run for me where I alternate between 1/2 mile at slow pace and 1/4 mile at the sprinting pace and then the final sprint I push myself for .4 miles.  Over time I've been increasing the speeds, and I can definitely tell it's helping.  My natural pace went from about 7.1 mph to 8.0 over the past 6 months.  

Recently I started wondering if trying out a different system of interval running would be beneficial, or if it would essentially be as effective as what I'm currently doing.  I was thinking of possibly a pyramid interval in order to try to get longer distances in during my sprinting portions.  I don't really have a specific goal that I'm working to attain.  Aside from natural buildup for better speed and endurance.  Just wondering if there would be any benefit by changing things up a little bit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The reason why race wins in NASCAR aren't really comparable to wins in other sports is because in other sports you only have 2 teams competing heads up.  So you have 1 team getting a win and 1 team getting a loss.  In NASCAR you have all 43 teams competing in the same event at the same time.  So to use a win loss record in NASCAR you would actually have 42 teams getting a loss on their record each week regardless if they finished 2nd or 42nd.  To sort of relate it to your comment here about playing it safe, you could technically say if a driver finishes 7th they lost to 6 teams, but won against 36 others. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In 2004, 2005 and 2006 there were 5 drivers with a shot at the championship going into Homestead each year.  Unless your talking about pre chase years with multiple drivers having a shot.  That I'd have to look into a bit more to see. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You made me go back and check that actually.  Matt Kenseth most likely would have won.  He got 2nd and Jr. got 3rd at Homestead.  But you also have to take into consideration if Jr would have been eliminated after the first round with his engine failure at Chicago. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agreeing with pretty much everyone else that this Chase format is a terrible idea.  But aside from the top 4 drivers going for the championship, are the remaining 12 that were eliminated from the chase essentially finishing in points in relation to where they are to the other 11 eliminated drivers at the Homestead race?  It says when someone is eliminated their total is reset to 2,000.  So does someone eliminated in the first round have their points reset to 2,000 after every 3rd chase race?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Scoring for rookie of the year question. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-11-05 19:20:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I know the scoring for rookie of the year is based entirely different from the points received for the championship.  The highest finishing rookie receives 10 points, second 9, then 8, etc.  On top of this there are points for attempting to qualify, getting a top 10, and a few other things.  Along with this, only the 17 top finishes per rookie are considered for their points.  My question is, out of those 17 finishes that are taken into account, how is a rookies points calculated if that race was a top 17 finish for them, but wasn't a top 17 for any other rookie?  Here's hypothetical example with Ricky and Danica.  Ricky gets 23rd place and Danica gets 25th.  Ricky has 17 other finishes higher than this race so this isn't taken into account for his rookie score.  But for Danica it is one of her top 17 finishes of the year.  Does this then only count for 9 points for Danica?  Of course with only 2 drivers it's not a big difference, but when there's a larger rookie field it would have more of an impact. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So during the race today my brother thought of something in regards to NASCAR's new rule that drivers give 100% effort all the time.  With the restrictor plate race some drivers say that their plan is to stay in the back until the end of the race.  By doing this aren't they actually giving less than 100% effort to try to win the race?  So shouldn't that driver get a penalty for doing this?  Just curious what your thoughts are about this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't like the elimination idea because if someone has problems out of their control, like and engine failure, in the first race they are screwed from the beginning.  They can go on to win 6 of the remaining Chase races and it won't matter because they were already elimited from something out of their control.  Besides, with the points structure there's already an elimination factor with the Chase.  It just takes several races to get into it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I just watched Arlington Road for the first time last night.  Overall I enjoyed the movie and think I understand pretty much everything that happened.  I just have 1 question though.  At the end of the movie, how does the bomb get into the trunk of Jeff Bridges rental car?  Did Tim Robbins know which car he was going to get and had it planted in the trunk beforehand?  Because I believe the only scene where Jeff Bridges isn't in the car is when he's fighting Tim Robbins in the warehouse building.  But I doubt that would have been when they planted it in the car. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When someone says that NASCAR isn't a sport because it's just cars driving in circles, I usually bring up the fact that they are just dumbing down what is actually going on.  If you explain basketball or football like that, then both of those sports are just running up and down a court/field tossing a ball around.  Doesn't sound too exciting that way.  Same with baseball, it's just guys standing around 95% of the time scratching themselves with someone throwing a ball every once in a while.  At least in NASCAR there's action going on 100% of the time during a race.  Granted some of the action is better than other times.  But essentially no other type of sport can make that claim.  Another point I'll make is that the majority of the NASCAR driversa are just as in shape, if not better, than a lot of athlese in other sports.  If this doesn't get through to them to at least acknowledge you have to be athletic to race, then they are just being ignorant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's entirely possible.  Through 5 races he currently has 145 points, and Ryan Newman in 20th has 121 points.  If you figure the person in 20th roughly doubles their points over the next 5 races that would give them 242.  So Hamlin would only be maybe 100 points out of 20th when he returns.  He will need 2 wins for sure, possibly 3 to get a wild card spot in the chase though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You have an initial budget of $100 and need to buy 5 drivers.  You can either try to buy 5 guys in the middle of the pack to have an overall good group.  Or you can spend the big bucks and get a top driver or two, but then sacrafice it by having to pick at least one lower level crappy driver to be able to afford all of them.  If your driver's value goes up, then you can sell them at a higher level than you bought them at and your entire salary cap increases.  For example: You buy someone that costs $20 and after 3 weeks they now are worth $21.  If you sell them, then your total salary cap will go up by $1.  But the same is true for drivers who go down in value.  You can sell them at a loss and take a hit, or you can try to ride them out and hope their value goes back up.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> My brothers and I went to the All Star race and Coke 600 last year for the first time.  Our hotel was downtown Charlotte and we drove to each of the races.  Basically for driving I took it easy to drive back each night.  Cooler sized for the track are 14" cube and it can be a hard or soft cooler.  As for leaving, once the race was over we hung out around our poarking lot for about 45 minutes which is about when traffice was starting to get thinner in our lot (still a LOT faster than Michigan takes to clead out).  So a cab probably won't work the best for leaving the track.  If your hotel is in the track area, you may be able to just walk the distance depending on where it is of course. </TEXT>

Someone came in and went straight to the kitchen fridge.  He heads back out the door with our ketchup in his hands and says "now all I need to do is find a hot dog" and left.

He's more of a fan than I am of the show, but I was trying to think of one as well and could come up with an episode.  Anyone know if there is a way to verify something like this? </TEXT>
