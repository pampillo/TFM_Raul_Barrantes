<TITLE> Movies where at some point during the film's early stages of development or pre production, someone else was originally attached to direct/write/star/etc? </TITLE>

<TEXT> Sorry if the title is slightly confusing. I'm not great with words.

I saw Ant Man and while I did think it was a good movie, I couldn't help but constantly think about what could've been if Edgar Wright was still the director.

I felt the same way watching the Steve Jobs biopic trailer. At some point David Fincher was suppose to direct with Christian Bale starring. I thought it was a perfect combination. I couldn't help but think what could've been while watching the trailer. Though I love Fassbender and Danny Boyle so I'm still holding on to hope.

Are there other films you can think of where someone was originally involved with a project from the beginning, but left early on, leaving it for someone else to continue? Did it ruin it for you because you were you thinking about what could've been? Do you wish that person had stayed or are you happy they left? Do you think it was for the better or worse? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So with Daniel Craig being nearly done with the role, it'll be almost time for a new actor as Bond. Obviously we don't know what era of Bond they go with, but if they went for a younger Bond, I think Matthew Lewis would be absolutely perfect for the role. Just an idea I wanted to get out there.

<TEXT> Paul Thomas Anderson doing horror. His films are already super tense. Imagine if he was actually trying to strike fear in your heart. 

Terrence Malick doing action or crime. 

David Fincher doing horror as well. 

Christopher Nolan doing a war movie. His scale and scope would fit this. WWII, Vietnam, Iraq, future war, etc. Any setting would work. 

Again, Terrence Malick, but doing a super hero movie. His God/Nature vs man, good vs evil themes would work well in this setting.  </TEXT>

So no one in the film business should be there if they have a love or passion for it? You don't have a love or passion for it? You're just there for the paycheck?

If you ask me, based on what I've heard, you're the one who's there for the wrong reasons. Not them.

<TEXT> It reminded me a lot of Limitless in some ways even though their stories aren't that similar. I can't tell you why I kept thinking of limitless, but I did for some reason.

The biggest disappointment for me was the visuals. I'm a huge fan of Tarsem Singh because even if his movies aren't great, like Immortals, at least they are gorgeous. I realize that Self/Less isn't a visual masterpiece because it's setting doesn't lend itself to that being a for the most part realistic modern setting. 

It doesn't take place in a fantasy world, or dreams, or ancient Greece. It's modern America. But that's why I see Singh films, so I was disappointed.

The film frustrated me because there are plenty glimpses of brilliance in there that they don't really do much with. This film had the potential to be a great, original sci fi flick, but everytime it starts getting interesting it turns back into a generic thriller.

The acting was unfortunately the best part for me. And I say unfortunately because I wish everything else was better. Everyone does a pretty great job in their roles though. Even the little girl I thought was fine.

My main gripe though is that it easily could've been a great film. So much wasted potential. They managed to turn a pretty great, original sci-fi idea into a generic movie, and that's the worst thing about it for me. </TEXT>

I think it's funny that the entire film wouldn't have happened if he did what Goode said and just didn't poke around.

Also, I kind of ended up agreeing with Goode's character, Albright. He was kind of right in that most medical breakthroughs had sacrifices. Reynolds was just being a nosy ungrateful dude.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're right, I completely forgot about Guardians of the Galaxy. And I haven't seen Winter Soldier but I hear it's great. When I say style, I mean more in how it's directed and shot, not what style of film it is. I do agree with you that they feel different, but they don't look particularly different except for GotG. I think that's because as time has gone on, Marvel studios has turned more into a factory. Directors have less and less say because of the vision Marvel has for its universe. 

Aside from GotG, I think most of them are visually bland and uninteresting. I get that they have to look like they are connected but still, I can't help but not care about what I'm looking at when I see a Marvel movie now. But that's just me being a "visuals" snob. I think that's why personally I'm more excited about BvS. When Zack Snyder and Larry Fong get together, it's always interesting. Now whether it'll be a good film or not is very 50/50, but boy will it be pretty. 

I just want it to be clear that I'm not faulting anyone who likes and enjoys Marvel movies. They are well made films. 

Edit: It's just, like, my opinion, man.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They did something unique then proceeded to do it over and over and over and over again. Marvel, while technically good, has gone stale for me. Ant Man was the first Marvel film I was actually excited for since the first Avengers. Then Edgar Wright left and took his style with him. Obviously I haven't seen Ant Man yet, but I'm expecting another Marvel cookie cutter film.

People can argue all they want about how good or bad Batman vs Superman looks, but one thing's for sure, it oozes style. Something that has been lacking in Marvel movies lately for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think it was so much he already had his mind made up as much as it was him just acknowledging that it wasn't a movie geared towards him and his taste. And while I do think it's important to review a movie based on what it is and not what you want it to be, I do think there is something to be said for reviewing a movie based off of who you are. Makes it a little easier to judge if you'd like a movie or not. For example, if I find I agree and generally have the same views as a certain reviewer, then it helps me determine if I'd like a movie or not.

It should also be said that Filmdrunk is a personality driven site by comedians. They aren't interested in objectively talking about movies. They enjoy speaking subjectively about them. They know they aren't, and never claim, to be the best, or most informative reviewers. 

Yes they can be very cynical, but that's just their personalities. And it should be said that they all have very different personalities and opinions. This is just one dude.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my experience, I kind of have to. I don't know and can't afford an editor *and* a cinematographer *and* a director *and* a writer etc. 

Sometimes you just have to do it all yourself. It's more stressful and harder, but you do what you gotta do. It's worked out alright for me in the past. 

When your just starting out, unless you have a lot of money, people, professionals, usually won't work for free. Now if you have previous work that is good, some might because it shows potential. But a lot of the times, at least for me, the only way to start a portfolio is to do some shorts where you're doing everything. 

However, it also depends on the scope of the project as well as your budget.  </TEXT>

As someone who has studied forensics in school, it is not. When you have a lot of blood condensed in a small area, it's dark. But blood, like you would get from a spray from a gunshot is very red. Even pooled blood is red. The deeper the blood, the darker it gets obviously, but blood from a typical gunshot or stab wound is red. The blood isn't thick/deep enough for it to appear dark.

But it doesn't take any sort of specialist to know this. Look at any pictures of crime scenes or surgeries and you'll see. Fresh blood is red. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I think this movie was very good, however I think I ruined it for myself. I was going into it with the expectation of crying my eyes out and having this huge emotional ride. I never got to that point. I kind of felt this movie just fizzled out. The climax wasn't that high for me. I dunno. Like I said, this movie is still very very good and the acting is great. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really really love romance movies like The Proposal. Movies where someone asks someone else to pretend to be their spouse or significant other in order to fool some person(s). However, in the process of pretending, they, of course, actually do fall in love. 

Are there more movies like this? I'm sure there has to be, right? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The writing wasn't terrible, the acting was good, the cinematography was good, and the directing was fine. In fact, it's no secret that a lot was cut for theatrical release. 

It's an average film, and if it wasn't a remake, people would be okay with it. I've seen both. I strongly believe that if people have the ability to see both, they should choose the original. Just like everyone else. However, if you only had the option to see the Lee one, for whatever reason, it's not bad. 

It's subpar to the original, but for the most part tells the same story without much change. That's why it's not a bad remake. Just unnecessary. As a film though, from a technical standpoint, it's not bad.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So my day started at, like, 3 am? I went to bed early then woke up waaay earlier than I wanted to. Oh well, took advantage of the time and finished up Bloodline! That show's pretty great. Got very suspenseful towards the end. Finale left me with mixed feelings. Still, great overall.

Had breakfast at around, I dunno, 6 maybe? More eggwhites. This time with spinach and chicken. Get dat protein. Then a tangerine. Started working on my film resume. Took a nap then went to work.

Work suuuuuuccckkks. Super slow. Strange customers. Ugh, I hate people. Waling around. Moving things. Not buying stuff. This lady was there walking around till after close and I'm just like "gtfo"

Had chicken and veggies for dinner. Should've seasoned the veggies...

Watched Wayward Pines. I have no idea what's going on in this show.

My mom and sister's birthday is tomorrow. They have the same birthday. *Still* haven't gotten a card. I'm a bad brother/son!

Think I might clean tomorrow. *Maybe*.

Really hyped about Mad Max this weekend! I'm seeing it with Zach and Kevin, my besties. It's gonna be sick!

<TEXT> So I guess this is the first "official" diary entry.

I'm assuming someone came in and downvoted everyone. Not just me, but the commenters. Not the environment I want to have, so I did something to prevent it in the future.

No more downvote arrow! Welcome to 1942 France!

No, but seriously it's not a diva thing of "how dare someone downvote me!" No, it's more about creating a non hostile environment. 

I started my diet and exercise this morning officially. Just a two week diet though. My cousin is getting married in two weeks and I wanna look decent in a suit. 

Diet is working so far. Had eggwhites this morning. I've been snacking on oranges and occasionally, tuna, throughout the day. I also went on a 3 mile walk. Already lost 2 pounds! It's nice to see results so soon.

Then I took a looooong nap. Felt great!

I wanted to get back down to 200lbs by August. I was 200lbs my senior year of high school, my peak physical fitness. Got 30lbs to go. Seems doable by August. I'm still kicking myself for not joining that gym back in January like I said I would. I am an artist and procrastination is my medium.

Other than that, not much has happened today.

Been talking to this girl. Real nice! We'll see how far this goes.

It's 9:48pm at the time of me writing this. Chicago PD is on in the background. That dudes voice is hilarious! I might spend the rest of my night watching the rest of Bloodline. I'm halfway through and I wanna finish before I forget what happens.

I dunno. Might play some Call of Duty? Oh yeah, I'm having PS4 problems. Forgot. Oh well. Maybe I'll play Rock Band 3?

Whatever, I'll figure something out.

<TEXT> I'm trying to figure out the best way to run this place. You know, a way where things are organized.

Thinking about how to title stuff. Should I include a date in the title? I feel like that'd be redundant considering reddit will quasi-date things for me. Maybe I should just number stuff, like "Entry 1", "Entry 2" and so on.

Maybe I'll just abandon all attempts of organization and just post things how they happen.

What if I categorize the posts? That might work. Such as "Diary Entry", "Picture", etc. But then that means I have to come up with headings, which also means I need to put some forethought into this. *Maybe*.

Who knows? Eventually things will just organize themselves, right? That's how I made it through high school.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This place is a diary of sorts. I'm test_subject6208, and though my life isn't interesting enough to warrant my own subreddit, I'm still doing it.

Why? I figured it'd be an outlet to talk about things anonymously, for the most part, while improving my writing skills at the same time.

I thought instead of just creating a massive post about who I am, I would just let things reveal themselves over time. Who I am as a person, my hobbies, likes, dislikes, my life, etc., will be revealed over time. I'll post "diary" entries that will be in the form of a text post, picture, or both. These entries will be about my days, thoughts, or whatever.

I've never been good at keeping a journal. Hopefully I'll be diligent with this. If Reddit stays around for a while, it might be an interesting, yet unconventional biography of sorts for whoever takes an interest in it.

Edit: It should be said that my style of writing is more like free writing, but less organized. Entries will most likely be written as I say it in my head with little thought of what makes sense, if that makes sense?

Note: I tend to be sarcastic and hyperbolic when I write. I'm trying to lessen it, but it's a habit. Can you have writing habits? Either way, just keep it in mind.  </TEXT>

I also find it interesting that Red Letter Media gets so much love in /r/movies. They are very cynical about movies and are often harsh and, at least on Half in the Bag(their review show), appear to not really keep up with movies and not care about most modern big budget movies, which /r/movies loves.

<TEXT> To make a long story short, I'm an aspiring filmmaker. Been working for years shooting various things. Never for profit. Finally, my work paid off. Met with someone that wrote a book that was being made into a film. Nothing big, they had a small budget. I was asked to help write then later, asked to direct. Things were coming together, we were just about to start writing. I then get news that they decided to hire professional writers and get a different director. I'm probably not involved anymore.

I'm not giving up filmmaking, but this was such a blow to the gut. Would love to eat this pain away.

<TEXT> I'm co-adapting a book into a screenplay. The book, however is primarily narration with vey little dialogue. I'm struggling with coming up with ways of telling this story without it lacking any dialogue. 

The book features many characters interacting, but rarely with any dialogue. They *do* talk, but in the book, there's no dialogue for the conversation the characters are having.

The author expressed interest in the film being primarily narration, but I'm not sure how to do this without it being tedious, boring, or overdone.

Not really sure what to do. Any advice or examples of films that pull this off would be very helpful. Thank you guys in advance. </TEXT>

I'm not necessarily saying they were intentionally misleading, but more so they appeared to be one kind of movie, but after seeing, turns out to be something else. 

My example is the film Martyrs. It's marketed as a horror and while it technically is horror, after seeing it it feels more like an emotional drama

Also The Babadook. For those who haven't seen it, it appears to be a horror film but after viewing, feels like a psychological family drama.

<TEXT> I know this isn't the type of thing that you would normally turn into a post, and I wouldn't be surprised if only a few people saw it, but I had to get it out because it's too perfect. 

What if Showgirls wasn't made when it was and instead was made today. And what if it wasn't directed by Paul Verhoven(?)? Who would be the best director for the Showgirls of the 2010s? 

Nicholas Winding Refn. 

I know Refn is a name that sometimes gets jerked around here, but bear with me. The story I think would fit his style. This strange crime-esque story with not so normal characters. Not to mention how well the Vegas Strip would work with his visual style. 

I'm just saying a Refn directed Showgirls could be awesome. 

So I guess the discussion part would be, if Refn directed Showgirls, would it be good? Or is showgirls so bad no director could save it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I give it massive points for being something new and original. Every time I thought I knew where it was going, it went somewhere else. 

That said, I think the ending felt really rushed. It's wired, throughout most of the movie I felt like these two people really loved each other, but by the end it felt rushed and I didn't really feel that way about the characters anymore. I understand that the movie couldn't be longer but I wish it was. It's a pretty dense movie. There's a lot you don't understand throughout most of it, then when it reveals things it feels like an information overload. Not that that's a bad thing, but I wish it took its time to explain things. 

I really really loved the first 3 quarters but feel very lukewarm about the 4th quarter. And because of it, I came away with an overall lukewarm impression of the film. 

Like I said, it's great that it took a risk at being something unique, and honestly, it *is* unique. I just wish I liked it more.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm getting a haircut and I really like the look of Trent Reznor's hair. I'm having trouble figuring out how long it is though due to how dark his hair is. Anyone got an idea of how long the top and sides are?

<TEXT> Yes and no. According to the contest, if you were a rich dude, yeah you could pay a large sum to go to the premiere, but you aren't guaranteed to *win* and hang with RDJ. It's still chance and you'd only be increasing your chance to win. I mean, if I payed $50,000 and got 500,000 entries, there's still the chance, however small, I'll still lose and not meet RDJ.

Bad example, but at my middle school dance, there was a raffle for an Xbox and you payed $1 for 1 raffle ticket and could buy as many as you want. People were paying upwards to $50 or more. But the dude who won it only bought 1 ticket.

<TEXT> I love everything David Fincher has done, but for me, it'd have to be The Social Network. I just feel like this was the movie where David Fincer really took every technique he had learned and combined them together. Everything in that film came together perfectly. And you can feel so much of TSN's influence in his later work such as Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, Gone Girl, and even House of Cards. I always thought David Fincher was a great director, but The Social Network really elevated him a whole new level. Yes Seven, Fight Club, and Zodiac are great, but I feel TSN was the movie where *everything* just perfectly came together. No single part felt subpar compared to the other parts. The Social Network is just a much more efficient machine than anything he's done before and since The Social Network. But again, I love everything Fincher has done.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think there is a noticeable difference between 24 and 30. I've shot short films in 24, 30, and 60 and I think 30 is close enough to 24 to where it isn't a big enough difference to matter. 

And I don't think it's just the frame rate that makes it more filmic. Like you said, aspect ratio, color grading, and cinematography are involved. Which The Order, I think, has some really filmic cinematography going on with its lighting. Some of the shots look straight out of a film. The aspect ratio also helps in this. I think The Order is an example of "What if we made a film into a game."

I'm not trying to defend this games short comings. I too think that the game is overpriced and probably won't be good. But I think out of all the weird decisions they've made, the 30 fps thing is the most believable and makes the most sense, even if they are just covering up a problem. 

I'm not saying that it's right for them to make it 30. I think it's very important for games to be 60 because every frame counts and can be the difference between success and failure. But if they are going for a more filmic and cinematic look, which it looks like they are, then 30 makes *some* sense. Or at least a little informed.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-02-08 01:37:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I recently just finished editing a short film I spent 7 months on. I'd love to have it be a 100 percent original film, so I'm looking for someone who'd be interested in scoring it.

I'm going to just put it out there so I don't waste anyone's time: I don't have money. This has been a passion project of mine that some friends were kind enough to help me with. I'm not saying that I expect someone to score it for free, but if I did pay someone, it wouldn't be a lot purely because I just *don't* have a lot.

Now that that's out there, let me tell you about the film. It's a small scale crime story about a cop bringing down two criminals. It's heavily inspired by classic film noir, but takes place in the modern day setting. It also takes a somewhat existential look at death.

I really could see some drone/ambient music fitting it well. But I'm not experienced in music, so I'm open to anything really.

I've done music for my own shorts before, but they're never good, so I'd love to have someone who actually knows something about music do the score.

If this isn't a good place for this post, could someone point me in the direction of a more proper subreddit?

Thank you so much! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello, I made a subreddit that I feel could be the sister subreddit of this place.

/r/FirstTitleThenStory is another kind of writing prompt subreddit I made where instead of a traditional prompt, the prompt is just a title. Nothing else. No other information. I thought it'd be an interesting experiment.

Is this something anyone would like? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey everyone! This is a subreddit where someone submits a "title" and people will reply with a story based off of that title! The idea behind this is to allow users to get even more creative!

Think of it as a writing prompt, but instead of a synopsis, all you have to go off of is a title. No genre, no style, no nothing.

Let me know if you have any questions or ways to improve this place!

Hopefully this will be a fun thing that will survive!

Edit: I'll post a title a day until the sub grows a bit. Hopefully it will! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think for me the reason I tend to get a steelbook over a normal one is because I see movies as works of art, so I think the cover art should reflect that. I don't just want my collection to be good. I want it to *look* good as well. I personally think most movies have terrible or generic cover art so that it's easier for them to sell, which is understandable. They have to make money.  I also think the blue cases throw off some good cover art.

Most steelbooks I come across have more interesting artwork and can get away with being more abstract so that's what's appealing about them to me. But if the steelbook art looks the same as the regular art, then I'll just go with the regular one since it'll be cheaper usually. And in some cases, the steelbook will have worse art. Like [these](http://i0.wp.com/www.pissedoffgeek.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/breaking-bad-steadman.jpg?resize=752%2C619) Breaking Bad ones. Sure, they're interesting, but I jus think they don't look good.

But that's the thing, it's all just preference. 

I'd have to say for me personally, it's steelslipcoverregular blu

But you're not idiotic for not liking steels. It's just a preference, man! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I mean, 1999 was like 15 years ago and 1990 was like 25 years ago. A lot has changed in cinema since then. A lot of advancements in technique and technology. It's perfectly reasonable to assume most movies of the 90s haven't stood the test of time. If you're someone who was born in the 70s, then the 90s probably don't feel old. But if you're someone who was born in the late 90s, that was an entire lifetime ago.

I don't consider the 90s "old" but it *was* over a decade ago. Heck, 1990 was a quarter of a century ago! It sounds old when you say it like that! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I dunno. I was thinking about it, and I'm not entirely sure it fits what I'm looking for. The thing about LNS, and I won't spoil anything, is that, while there *is* a character that isn't who they say they are, it doesn't really play on this. LNS doesn't really show you-know-who's character as a mysterious one, they just use flat out misdirection, which I don't think is the same thing.

The thing about the movies I used as examples, The Guest and Stoker, is that they don't misdirect you into believing the character's are something opposite of what they really are. Instead, they leave their backstories vague and almost breadcrumb-like hints about the true nature of their characters. In fact, right from the get go you feel something is off about the characters.

LNS, on the other hand, leaves you no hints to who the character really is, and I personally never felt like something was of about LNS's character. They don't ever give you a reason to not believe the character is who they say they are.

Now don't get me wrong, I think LNS is a fantastic movie and I love it. I also haven't seen it in a while, so I could be super wrong in all of this and might be overlooking some things that I have forgotten about it. However, I don't remember getting a "this person isn't who they say they are" vibe from LNS. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just watched The Guest and I really enjoyed the first half of it because it plays as a mystery. You're wondering who this guy *really* is, and you get a sense that the character is not who they say they are, and their background is kind of unclear whether it's true or not.

Another film I can thin of that kind of follows this is Stoker. In Stoker, you're not really sure who Matthew Goode's character *really* is, but there's something mysterious and off about him.

An interesting thing to note is that in both of these films, the mysterious character is a very charming and charismatic guy.

Are there any other movies that play around with the idea of someone not being who they say they are? Or where a character's true identity or back story is a mystery? 

I'd like to see more movies where there is a character who is mysterious, kind of off, and gives off an "I'm not who you think I am" kind of vibe.

Edit: I thought maybe it'd help if I clarify that I'm not looking for movies that just simply have a character that's not who you think they are, but movies that have a character that's not who you think they are and *the movie plays on this idea*. If that makes sense. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Storyboarding will save you time and are so efficient. The best part is that you don't have to be a good artist. Since you are directing and operating the camera, you are really the only person who needs to be able to discern them.

Storyboarding will make shooting so much easier and organized. It's so nice to go into a shoot knowing exactly what shots you need. Too many times I've gone into shoots without a storyboard planning to just improvise and I end up wasting a lot of time standing around trying to figure out shots. You save so much time when you storyboard because when you're done with one shot, you just refer to your board and can immediately know where and how to set up your camera. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wouldn't say it's more /r/movies tier than most post on here. I posted this to get more of an understanding of what others thought of Goodfellas. 

It is entirely possible that Goodfellas was overhyped for me, and, in turn, I set myself up for disappointment. It's kind of hard for me to explain why it rubbed me the wrong way. I've never been great at articulating. I never said Goodfellas was bad. I do think it's a good movie. Above average and better than most movies. I just think that when compared to Scorsese's other work, Goodfellas hardly stands up. I know this isn't a great answer and not what you wanted to hear. 

Someone else said it earlier in this thread. They said that since I have seen Scorsese's recent work before I saw Goodfellas, it probably didn't seem like anything new or special. However, had I seen it when it came out, it would've been very fresh and interesting. I think this is entirely possible.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I tend to enjoy them. It's interesting, movies are supposed to be a way of escapism. That's why I go see blockbusters. But there have been so many big budget movies in the last year or so, that I look forward to these small, hyper-realistic films. They're a nice break from all the blockbusters. An escape from escapism movies, if you will. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Triple Nine sounds great. Great cast and great director.

Everest is a great story with a great cast, but I'm worried about the director. Contraband and 2 Guns weren't great and this is the kind of story that needs a director that will do it justice. Although he did make an Oscar nominated film so there is still hope.

Is the Jungle Book going to be animated or live action? And will it be 3D or 2D animation? Do we know?

I had no idea the Coen brothers were writing a film for Steven Spielberg. That sounds pretty great.

The Martian is such a good book and I'm excited to see it, but I'm extremely worried since Ridley Scott is directing.

Never heard of The Revenant, but consider me excited. Interesting story and I love Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu.

Thanks for posting this, OP. I hadn't heard of some of these before so now I have new movies to look forward to! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree that Fincher's visual style would fit well. I don't know why what I said pissed a couple of people off, but I think Anderson is great at creating a tense atmosphere. Look at There Will Be Blood, it's not at all a scary movie, but it definitely felt unnerving and tense the whole time. Now imagine if he was actually trying to scare you. 

David Fincher is easily my favorite director working today, but I always thought his style was better suited for real world movies. Movies that are more grounded in reality. Which the same could be said for PTA, but I can see them both making a good Bioshock. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I just saw John Wick and really liked it, but I was kind of distracted by the CGI blood. I'm a huge advocate for practical effects like actual squibs. However I totally understand the benefits of CGI blood like not having to clean up your set or actors or wardrobe when you reset a shot. So it logistically makes sense. And there are examples of good CGI of organic things like water. 

So why is CGI blood still kind of bad for the most part and are there any examples where the CGI blood and gore looked really good? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is the Tree of Life technically a bad movie? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-06 01:45:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I really love the Tree of Life and my friends don't. I'm fine with this. People like different things. This doesn't bother me. What bothers me is that they say it's a "shit movie" and it's "terrible". They don't say they *think* it's bad they will say "No, dude, Tree of Life is bad."

This didn't use to bother me because my friends are the kind of movie goes who would rather watch an action movie. Not that there is anything wrong with that. So I just chalked it up to the fact that it's just a very different movie than what they are used to.

But then my film friend, a guy I've known since high school and talk movies with all the time, recently watched it. I thought, "Finally, someone who appreciates all kinds of movies will watch this with me." We watch it and I'm like, "Now I know someone else who will like it and I can talk to him about it." But alas, he also tells me it's pretty terrible.

So this got me thinking, am I missing something? Again, it's totally fine that my friends don't like Tree of Life. What bugs me is that they will objectively say it's a bad film. So artistic stuff aside, is The Tree of Life *technically* a bad movie?

Their reasoning is that the story is bad and say it's too hard to follow. 

So now I'm genuinely curious, is it bad technically? Am I biased because of how the movie affected me emotionally? So much so to where I cannot view it objectively?

Edit: I just want to clarify that I'm not here to pander. I seriously want to discuss the technical aspects of this film and the structure of the story. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's hard to compare the two because Fight Club is this weird combo of surreal comedy/drama whereas The Game is a psychological thriller. I feel like The Game is more accessible to wider audiences because it's easier to get in to. It has a, for the most part, straight forward story that, while there may be a lot of twists, it's still easy to follow what's going on.

While on the other hand I find Fight Club harder to recommend to people because of how strange it is. It breaks the fourth wall, jumps around in time, lots of narration, it's very cynical, satirical, dark humor, at times offensive, and other times brutally violent all while maintaing this overall sense of humor and satire. I love it more than The Game, but The Game is much easier to digest. And because it's a lesser known Fincher film, I feel you'd have a better time finding people to watch it with that don't know about it, whereas Fight Club? Pretty much everyone knows about it.

All in all I like Fight Club more and think it's better than The Game, but I go to them for different reasons because they are different. While they are both good WTF movies. Fight Club only gets WTF towards the end while The Game is WTF pretty much throughout. Also, I find The Game to be Fincher's least Fincher movie, but that's just me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> By your logic then, Memento could totally hang with the likes of those films. You say what makes the movies you listed "bold" is that they demand something from the viewer. Memento totally demands the attention of the viewer as well as multiple viewings if you want to truly understand it all. You said Nolan isn't difficult or bold. Maybe to a lover of film like yourself. But to the general public he is. I know plenty of people that cannot sit through Memento or Inception because of the complexity of those films. To the average moviegoer, these films hurt your head to think about and they aren't the kinds of movies you can just turn your brain off for. </TEXT>

It's a movie that doesn't have a lot of modern technologies so it could've been made any time. It also feels like an old school Clint Eastwood "Man with no name" kind of movie. Sixty years from now we'll look back and go, "Yep, still a great movie." </TEXT>

<TITLE> What's up with Memphis' unpredictable theatrical releases? </TITLE>

<TEXT> I just wanna see Birdman. It's apparently not playing anywhere in or around the city. What's up with that?

We get The Guest which is a super small indie film, heck we get small indie films all the time, why wouldn't we get a star studded film that has gotten critical acclaim?

Is it the theater choosing not to show it or is it the film distributer not wanting to show it here?

Just thought it was super weird. Memphis theaters are always unpredictable when it comes to indie films, but I thought Birdman would surely be here. 

Anyone know of any place that is showing it that I'm just unaware of? I only checked Malco and Ayjay cinemas. Are there any other movie theaters in or around the city? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I glanced over the doc(I'll read more in depth latter) and most of that stuff I'm aware of and hasn't really affected me. I'm definitely aware of the LGBT issues due to my cousin being gay. I can't say I agree with their stance on that. I think that since I'm aware of most of this stuff it doesn't affect me. By that I mean I don't agree with most of it and I don't act out any of it. None of the stuff really directly affects me. Now if I was a woman, it'd be different because of how much it *would* directly affect me. 

Also, the last part bothered me. The part about only Mormons go to heaven and if you leave, you never see your family again. To the best of my understanding, that's entirely false. Everyone goes to heaven. There is no hell. The only thing is what level of heaven you go to. You will for sure see your family again even if you leave, because the family that stays will be able to visit you as often and as long as they want. You can travel to the lower tiers, you just can't travel to the upper tier(s) if you reside in the lower one(s). At least, according to the teachings.

Like I said, I'll continue to read more to inform my opinion better.

But I do want to thank you for the discussion. And I wish you the best as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The thing is though, is that I don't want to know if it's made up. In fact, I kind of just don't care if it's made up or true. If I leave, I'd rather it be because it's not right for me because of the way I live. I don't want to learn it's made up *because* my loved ones believe it. I wouldn't want to know it to be false and have my family believe it to be true at the same time. That would make things harder for me deal with. I've never been the kind of person to create friction. I wouldn't want *them* to start questioning it as well, because they're happy believing it. 

I've thought about my future constantly from both sides. How would it be if I wasn't Mormon? How would it be if I was? I can honestly see myself happy in both scenarios. But I can also see myself being unhappy in both as well. So I just take it day by day and have just decided to go with it. Let fate push and pull me where it must.

The way I see it, I'm happy with how I'm living now. I've found some weird equilibrium and for now, I'm okay with it. 

By the way, I wanted to ask you something. I was afraid to ask earlier because I was afraid you would think I was being snarky, but now that things are diffused, What's with your username? If you don't believe, then why that username? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never once said that what was posted was anti Mormon. I also don't blindly follow this religion. I've seen a bunch of different perspectives. Heck, half my family isn't Mormon. If you were to watch me go through one day of my life you'd see that I'm not a good Mormon. I'm pretty much Mormon in name only. Yeah I don't do drugs or smoke or drink but that's just a personal thing that I've never been in to. But I do and support many things the church doesn't. You and I are not the same. You weren't in my shoes. I'm not saying your experience doesn't hold any value, but people have different lives. Things vary person to person. You said we were taught that questioning the church is a sin. I was never taught that. I was always told it was normal and it was up to us to do the research and figure out for ourselves if it was true or not. 

I'm always struggling with religion. Honestly maybe I don't care if it's true or not. Maybe I like believing there is a God. Believing in an afterlife and great plan for everyone. I stay Mormon not because I'm worried what other Mormons think, but because of my family. I mean they love and support me no matter what, even if I did leave, but there would still be disappointment. I also enjoy the community of the church. I go to the singles branch so no one there is pushy or preachy. They're all really cool and nice people that are around my age that are fun to talk to. 

I know you never said this, but I just wanted it to be clear that I'm not a hardcore devout Mormon blindly following a religion I know nothing about. I'm simply an impostor playing pretend because it's the easiest thing to do right now. Playing pretend until I can discover how I really feel on my own. I consider everything and rule nothing out. That's why I look at both sides. Yeah I may not do a lot of reading. I never said that was a good thing. I wasn't bragging about it. It's a flaw and I will have to read a lot to discover how I really feel. I realize everything I just said may seem hypocritical and might null everything I've said in previous comments, but that's the honest truth. 

I'm just a dude on the internet.

<TEXT> Well for one I never claimed to know the absolute truth. And I never said I was more right than a Jew or Catholic. I'm just a dude on the internet who likes movies and doesn't like reading. 

I also never claimed anything specific to be anti Mormon. Like you said, I probably never read the stuff you talked about. So it didn't really make since to me why you'd bring that stuff up when I never claimed anything specifically, and especially not the stuff you brought up, to be anti Mormon or hostile. It was all kind of irrelevant. You asking me what about all those publications is hostile is a weird question when I didn't say any of them were. You simply asked me to define "anti Mormon". So I did.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess people or things that aggressively oppose Mormons or Mormonism with hostility? I personally use it to describe things that are hostile and aggressively opposed to it. It's fine to oppose something, it's when it gets aggressive and hostile I'd start using the term "anti". Technically, you can totally be anti anything and not be aggressive which is perfectly fine. So long as no one is getting mentally, emotionally, or physically hurt. I didn't mean what was posted was anti Mormon (I didn't read it obviously) or you or anyone here specifically. I was just saying I read that stuff all the time. I mean you come across that stuff frequently on the internet often so you can't really avoid it. And I don't really try to avoid it for that matter. Like I said, I'll read anything, anti Mormon or not, as long as it's not too long. Or I find it interesting. So I guess I should correct myself, I hate reading unless it's something I truly find interesting or love, like film. I could read for hours about movies.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Never said I was temple worthy. I don't pay tithing. I'm not a good Mormon. I agree with you that it's not right to group the Mormons together as people because they're different person by person. That's been my problem with this thread. There's a bunch of people in here saying that Mormons are bad people and "love bombers" and malicious. I'm okay with people having problems with the church as a whole and certain individual Mormons, but when you start grouping them together and call me terrible because I'm Mormon that's when I get upset. I'm not like most Mormons because of my family. I have a gay cousin that I love and half my family isn't Mormon so I was raised to never judge people based on their religion but who they are as a person. 

I was downvoted earlier just because I told someone there are great people who happen to be Mormon and said that I was Mormon as well and just wanted everyone to be treated equally. Why? Who knows. I wasn't being dishonest, I was respectful and polite and non aggressive. 

My motto has always been "Live and let live. Don't worry about what other people are doing unless it directly affects you." </TEXT>

<TEXT> This will sound stupid, but religion isn't about believing with your brain, but with your heart. Religion isn't about finding out if it's factually accurate, it's about faith. And it is up to the individual to choose to have faith or not. See, I always thought the people who call Joseph Smith a con man and call Mormonism a hoax are just as bad as the religious people who push their religion on others. It's the same thing, but instead of pushing their beliefs, they're pushing their disbelief onto others. People should just live and let live. Someone believes in something you don't? Who cares. You think it makes them an idiot? Who cares. I'm sure we all have more important things to deal with than worry about what someone else believes in. I'm not talking bout you specifically, relevantlife, I'm talking people in general including me.

I find myself constantly struggling with my beliefs, but in my experience, yeah I've seen people have a bad experience with Mormons and the religion, but I've also seen people's lives change for the better as well. Just like any religion or belief or whatever. But what do I really know? I'm just a person.

We are all just people. We can't prove (a)God exists and we can't prove (a)God doesn't exist, so that means we are all just arguing about who's hypothesis is better, which is why religious debates are so dumb. </TEXT>

What are some good ways to prevent, battle, or fix noisy footage? And should I just invest in a better camera? </TEXT>

I don't even care if you're an actor or not. If you believe you can act and can appear menacing, please give it a shot.

If you volunteer please know it's unpaid(I'm broke) and it *is* a main role so one other shooting day will be in the future(October 25th). After that you're done. 

The role calls for a male actor. Age unspecified as well as race. The only thing is you have to look like someone in their late 20s or early 30s. Also, I can provide footage of the day 1 shoot to show we know what we're doing and this won't be a terrible home movie.

I'm in a terrible situation here and this is my last ditch attempt to save this project that has already been started and has had the heart, soul, blood, sweat, and tears of other people poured into it. Help? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel lie this doesn't solve it because now, instead of waiting to see if one movie has a great ending, you're waiting to see if three movies have great endings.

You're still asking people to post a great ending movie, the only difference is that they are posting two other movies as well. You'll still be looking forward to the great ending, which is what you wanted to avoid. Only now you'll be disappointed two thirds of the time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fun Fact: The e-cig is actually a movie prop! It's a plastic cigarette and you screw in butt, and when you inhale, the end lights up. It's mostly for actors who do not smoke and wish to keep it that way. It's all just vapor!

<TEXT> Edge of Tomorrow - A Most Wanted Man - The Drop - Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

I have not seen these movies yet but I *do* want to see them. Because of where I live and how long two of them have been out, when Friday hits none of them will be playing here anymore. I want to catch them before they leave the theater.

I'm working and going to school this week so tomorrow/today(Tuesday) is my only free day. And because of the showtimes, I only have time to see three of them. This put me in a position to make a hard choice!

Which of the four, without spoiling things, can I eliminate and wait to see on Redbox or something? Which three are the must see ones? I realize this all depends on my personal taste, but what do you guys have to say?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not that I'm complaining. But I was just thinking about how many films today have synthy, 80s inspired scores and looks to them. 

What movie started this? There was a time in 90s and early to late 2000s where most movie had typical cinematic scores and looks. But something changed and we started getting more and more films that have had their look and music inspired by the 80s. </TEXT>

Should consider yourself lucky that you at least have the option to grow your beard out or not. You don't *have* to shave because the worst thing that'll happen is you get a nice beard.

<TITLE> I want to talk about Matthew McConaughey </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-27 00:29:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> What was it about Matthew McConaughey that changed? It's no secret that lately McConaughey has turned into one of Hollywood's "go to" guy as of late. He has turned his career around and went from being a joke to being one of the most talented actors working today. 

My question is, what was it that changed? Did McConaughey actually become a better actor, or did he just start choosing better movies?

I was watching Sahara, the adventure movie from 2005, and noticed that McConaughey himself hadn't really changed. It felt like the same Matthew that we are getting today. He still acted the same, yet I still felt like I was watching a not good McConaughey performance. I didn't *think* he gave a bad performance but it *felt* like a bad one, if that makes sense? 

So when did this change in McConaughey happen? And was the change with himself and how he acted in projects, or was it simply he started picking better projects? </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was in high school some buddies and I went to shoot a video for our film class. We needed shots of planes taking off. So we thought it would be a good idea to go to our international airport and film planes taking off while we were on a dirt road that went between the runways. I was also wearing a ghillie suit. 

The next thing we knew three suv's with fully tactical cops came driving up. They made us erase all of our footage. We explained to them what we were doing. We found out they were pretty cool and joked around with us, and even told us where we could go to get permission to film planes. Then they let us go.

That situation could have gone so bad but lucky for us we were dealing with some cool cops. </TEXT>

And finally, "This should be in the game. I bet it was but they just took it out." You should not be surprised and should expect this by now. I'm with you in that it sucks, but this is normal now. In fact it's weird if games don't have preorder bonuses now.  </TEXT>

I also had this film class. I miss that because I got to make short films with my best friends. 

I think I just miss my friends. Once I graduated, I only stayed in contact with like three of my friends and I only got to see them like once every week or two.

But yeah, I just really miss my senior year. Great friends, great teachers, classes, and a great, happy life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He's one of the few directors that puts a lot of work into the writing and characters

His movies are shot really well. The composition is great and there's just something about the lighting in his films. The camera work is also always great.

His writing may be self indulgent, but it is always sharp and smart. His movies are some of the few that I actually enjoy listening to just as much as watching. He makes pretty entrancing conversations between characters that really hold your attention.

I think he does a good job of pacing a story even if it is long. He knows how to move a story forward.

His films have good consistency. I don't mean his films are consistent with each other, but his films by themselves are consistent in tone.

I personally don't find his movies boring, though I can see how someone would. He makes entertaining movies that almost always have some sort of fun quality to them. 

I find him to be sort of a breath of fresh air. He only makes movies like once every couple or so years. He actually takes some time to makes sure that it's quality work. Yeah, not all of his films are perfect, but I think he still makes above average films consistently. And I do think there is some nice uniqueness to his films. Even if it's something we've seen before he manages to find a way to turn it into something different. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Goodfellas is not as good as everyone says it is. It's a good movie, but definitely not as remarkable as people say. I have a hard time considering it to be in Scorsese's top 5.

Gravity, aside from its technicals aspects, is incredibly bland. In fact, it's pretty below average.

The Rock is not the best action movie ever. Not even close.

The Godfather is boring.

I think Terrence Malick is one of the greatest directors of all time.

I think The Tree of Life is one of the best movies ever made.

I think The Matrix Reloaded is awesome and not terrible. It's still a cut above most movies that come out today.

I think The Dark Knight is one of the best crime movies since Heat.

Only God Forgives was one of the best movies not only of 2013, but of the decade as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't speak for everyone, but what made it great for me was the theme of fathers and sons. I have a close relationship with my father and this movie really got to me emotionally. I also really loved the fact that it felt like a Greek tragedy play with its clear three act structure. I can totally see people not liking it though. I thought the reveal of what happens to Gosling's character was a great twist I didn't see coming. 

I don't know if it will be considered a classic, but it will always be one of my all time favorites.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I honestly think you should see it for yourself. It's been pretty divisive. I've heard some call it one of the worst movies they've seen, and some call it one of the best. I guess it all depends on what *you* want out of a movie, and what you're looking for in one. Just make sure you set your expectations right for what it is. Know what you're getting yourself in to. If you go into it thinking it will be a post apocalyptic sci-fi action movie, you'll have a bad time. It's a drama that is set upon the backdrop of the post apocalypse and it takes its time.  </TEXT>

If not that then No Country for Old Men. It's one of the few movies that is almost perfect in every aspect.

The Tree of Life is probably the movie that affected me the most emotionally the past decade.

I think it's one of the few movies that is technically perfect in almost every single way. The writing is great. The cinematography, the acting, directing, sound design, and editing are all near perfect. 

It also has a great simple yet deep story and characters. It's also an incredibly well paced film. It never drags. It always feels so tense and so tightly done.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I might have worded that weird, but at work today a bunch of ink spilled all over the laminate flooring. After spending hours scrubbing the floor is still stained. 

I look at my hands and see they are covered in ink. I think to myself, "Oh great, I'll be cleaning my hands forever." But to my surprise my hands were rid of any trace of ink after washing my hands for like 2 minutes. 

So what makes skin hard to stain? Why was this ink so easy to clean off my hands but impossible to clean off the floor? Did it have to do with skin, the ink, or the laminate flooring? Regardless of whether this has to do with the material of the flooring or not, my question still stands: What makes skin so hard to stain and all around resilient and resistant? </TEXT>

Skate 4 (Which doesn't seem likely)

Rock Band 4 (Which doesn't seem likely)

The next Elder Scrolls game (which doesn't seem likely)

Fallout 4 (Which could happen)

and Red Dead Redemption sequel (which who knows)

I'm just kind of not interested in really any of the already announced games. I really REALLY hope there are a good amount of surprises and new ip reveals this E3 and it isn't just more of what we have already seen. 

I haven't gotten a new console yet because I'm just waiting for that game that will make me say, "Okay, I *need* to get a new console." So far, none of the already announced games have made me say that.  </TEXT>

It was a four lane highway and a guy driving in the opposite lane went by me and hit a huge puddle, splashing water all over my windshield. I lost all visibility for like 3 or 4 seconds. I panicked but knew that as long as I kept my car straight I should be fine. But I hit a puddle and hydroplaned while driving blind. Went into a ditch and rolled a few times. 

I wasn't seriously injured. Just a few scrapes and was sore. But when I lost visibility and hydroplaned, I thought to myself, "This is it. This is where I die."  I seriously thought I was going to die.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm looking for a new show to obsess over, but I'm looking for one that's just half an hour long instead of a full hour. The reason for this is that I have a hard time watching an hour long show because I feel like I'm not getting far into the show.

Like for example, in a 3 hour period I could watch 6-8 episodes of a half hour long show. Whereas with an hour long show I could only watch like 3 or 4. I just don't have a lot of time unfortunately. I totally wish I did cause I would totally watch the heck out of Breaking Bad and House of Cards.

I'm up for any genre. So, what are some really good and entertaining 30 minute shows?

<TEXT> I think it's just the opposite though. I know John Carter will be about a dude named John Carter. That title tells me *exactly* what it's about. And besides *tons* of movies have titles that tell you nothing about the movie. In fact, some of the most successful movies have titles that don't tell you what the movie is about and they did well. Also, there have been many movies where the title is just the character's name, just like John Carter.

Honestly, the title had very little to do with the movie flopping, and was more the fault of the marketing and advertising team. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Samsara. Quite possibly *the best* looking blu ray out there. Jaw droppingly gorgeous.

The Tree of Life is another stunning film. The creation of the universe scene *has* to be seen on blu ray.

No Country for Old Men is another great blu ray addition, as well as the 2009 Star Trek.

Only God Forgives was one of the most beautiful movies to come out last year. Absolutely stellar cinematography. The look and music of this film are enough to warrant a blind buy if you've never seen it.

The Matrix is a great one as well. Especially the Ultimate Matrix Collection box set that has 35 hours of bonus features. That alone makes it worth it even if the film itself doesn't look good, which it does in fact look great!

Immortals, while a not great movie, is beautiful. Now is that enough to warrant a buy? That's up for debate, but since you can get it for a cheap price, it's not a bad addition.

Fantastic Mr. Fox is a great addition! Especially now that it has a Criterion release. This is a very pretty film that looks stunning on blu ray.

Lastly, 300. This film has some of the most beautiful cinematography of the last decade. I find it to be a must own blu ray, but that's just me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My absolute favorite genre of books are crime by far with mystery at a very close second. I love Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone, and No Country for Old Men.

I'm a very visual person who really loves movies as you can probably tell by my favorite books, so it has always been hard for me to get into books. But there's just something about a good crime or mystery book that gets me super interested.

It doesn't necessarily have to be about cops either. Also, if it has some good violence, that'd be great! I also am really into crime stories that are dark, tragic and don't usually end happy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I should preface this by saying that I've never seen a Godzilla film besides Roland Emerich's.

Overall  I thought it was alright, but underwhelming. I'll get to the positives before the negatives because my positives basically echo everyone else.

I thought the movie looked great and was shot really well. I also thought the acting was actually pretty great. Cranston was of course fantastic and I'm glad to see Taylor-Johnson getting more roles. And Watanabe and Olsen, despite how little their characters contributed to the story, were really great as well. Godzilla's design was fantastic as well as the kaiju's designs.

Now the negatives. The human drama might have been too much, or at least pointless. I felt Olsen's character was a little pointless and didn't do anything except give our hero something to lose.

I honestly think the final battle would have been so much better if it happened in daylight instead of night. It was already hard to see things with all the smoke, but then the darkness made it even harder to see things.

This brings me to my next complaint. I don't know, maybe it was just my theater, but did this movie look a little dark to anyone? Again, this was probably just my theater so this might not be a problem with the movie.

I found the sense of scale to be lacking. I could totally *see* the sense of scale, but I couldn't *feel* it, if that makes sense. Like the creatures looked huge but they didn't feel huge. I couldn't feel the weight. Like at the Hawaiian airport when Godzilla stepped right in front of the windows, i feel like there should've been more bass or the glass should've cracked or shattered, but it was just kind of soft for a monster that size. Also, the final battle didn't feel huge. Buildings were crumbling and falling over, but it just sounded too quiet. So I guess that's a problem with the sound design. I also thought his roar was kind of underwhelming.

I honestly think the whole military "blow up the monster/aliens with a big bomb, but the bomb malfunctions so some person/people have to go on a suicide mission to manually detonate the bomb" thing is so over-done and eye-rolling. I think it would have been so much better if the military was all like, "All we can do is just hope that these monsters will kill each other of and pray we'll survive." Like, why couldn't humans just stand aside and follow Watanabe's advice and "Let them fight"? It would've made for a more entertaining movie if it was 30% human drama and 70% monsters fighting. Instead of 80% cliche military stuff and 20% monsters fighting.

The last complaint I have is that it should have been either Godzilla vs the military with no kaiju , or Godzilla vs kaiju with very little military action. I think it was just way too much to have Godzilla vs kaiju vs military. All the military stuff should have taken a back seat, but instead, the military stuff was driving the whole thing and the monster stuff was riding in the trunk.

I know I sound like I hated this movie, but I don't. It's not a bad movie at all, I just personally found it underwhelming.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> I've lost all interest in a project I'm working on </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-10 14:30:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A few months ago my partner and I started work on a romantic drama for our next project. At the time I was excited because the story was great and the concept was great and we were looking forward to doing a different kind of film. 

Fast forward to today and I'm about halfway through writing the film and I've just...lost all interest in it. 

Over the course of the last few months the project has been behind schedule due to life(school and work). So I've gone from being really pumped about the project to being kind of stressed and just uninterested in it. I really want to put my heart and soul into every project I work on but my heart just isn't in this project. 

It's not in my wheelhouse or my interest. I love writing crime stories and mysteries, so going from that to a romance is so...different for me. I'm never sure what to do and I'm worried the end result will be not that good with a shallow story, bad characters and really nothing special. 

I've just lost so much steam. I think that the worst part is that while I'm writing this film, there are a handful of other projects I'd rather be working on. We've had to make creative changes to our romantic drama in order to make it work and a lot of these changes were things I liked so I personally don't feel invested in it at all. 

The only thing keeping me going is that my partner *is* excited about the project. I can't just drop out. Not now. But I feel my lack of interest in the project will end up hurting the final product. 

Any advice? Any way I could regain interest somehow? Should I drop out? I'm really lost here.  </TEXT>

Shame tells a different story we don't ever see. It was so raw and showed just how damaging sex addiction can be to ones life. It was the film that made me fall in love with Michael Fassbender.

I found 3/4 of The Conjuring great with the last quarter turning into a cliche fest. I also find The Strangers really good even though most people think its bad. Them is probably one of the best horrors I've seen along with the Descent.  </TEXT>

I found it to be so strange yet completely engrossing. I couldn't look away and the music was fantastic. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The main reason I saw Under the Skin was because this weekend was the last weekend any theater in my town was playing it and Grand Budapest was going to stick around longer. I still plan on seeing it, but I'm glad I saw Under the Skin before it went away.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah I totally get that. It's not the best movie, but I think in terms of sci-fi, it's pretty original and executes its concept well without being overly complicated. But I do totally see how someone wouldn't like it. As a sci-fi I think it's good, but as a movie it's not the best.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So at work tonight, after we closed, I locked the door then went to do closing duties like I'm supposed to. I then hear the door chimes jiggle quite furiously. I walk to the front and see a woman and two kids. Turns out that the deadbolt was locked but the pegs at the top and bottom weren't so the door kind of pulled open. It was after we closed so I simply told them with a smile that we were closed. She smiled and said, "Oh, sorry." Then left. 

So my manager came out and asked me what happened saying that someone from the offices was mad at me for "kicking" someone out. I told my manager that I simply told her we were closed. I didn't ask her to leave or anything. She left on her own. My manager told me that even so, we can't kick them out. I know you can't kick a customer out if they came in before you closed, but I figured it was different if they came in after the store was closed. 

I then come home and tell my mother what happened and she asked me if they were going to talk to me at work. I told her if they did I wasn't worried because I didn't know any better. We were closed and the registers were in the back. I then jokingly told my mother that the lady technically broke in since we were closed. My mom proceeded to take it way too seriously and started going on about how "You can't tell your managers that!" and "You don't say stuff like that. Take responsibility." We then started arguing. I was telling her that I knew that. It was just a joke. I know I can't tell my supervisors that. She was like, "Well how do I know that." 

What I'm getting at is that my mom always wants me to tell her stuff but when I do she always tries too hard to read between the lines looking for some deeper meaning when there is none. Then she did something I hate. She pity apologized me. She was all like, "Sorry you're right I'm wrong." Just don't apologize at all if you don't mean it because it only makes things worse. 

Then she said for me to drop it, meaning the argument. I can't! I can't leave this argument with me being the bad guy! I'm not wrong! Am I? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going to a movie tomorrow by myself. These two movies are the only ones I have interest in that I haven't seen. I know they are two very different movies, but which should I see? I've heard good things about both. I really enjoy Wes Anderson films, but I also really enjoy some nice cerebral, low-key sci-fi, and I don't mind a slow paced film.

Would I have to be in a certain mood in order to enjoy Under the Skin? What are some other films like it so I can compare it to what I've seen before? </TEXT>

I used to be depressed because I wasn't in school, unemployed, and had no love life. Now I'm two thirds there, so I'm feeling better about myself. I'm trying to get in shape so my confidence will build. I'm going to need it to start dating.

I miss my friends. They all work and have school, and are dating or engaged to someone so I'm starting to feel a little lonely.

Good things are happening though. This summer I'm starting work on my first feature film, so I'm really excited about that.

But all in all, I'm alright. A little stressed, but alright. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So for months I've been trying to find entertaining things to do in single player(I don't normally play multiplayer because I don't have friends). I guess it could also work in multiplayer. 

Vigilante crime fighter. I mean like a real world super hero. I dress in black, wear a mask, and fight crime! Making sure I don't kill cops or innocents. This gave me hours of enjoyment! It was real fun to break up a crime or killing some gang members, then evading the police without killing them. 

I guess in multiplayer this would be more fun because you could stop and fight actual players which are more interesting than NPCs.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> * What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible. 

* Mostly Gaming, not multiplayer but single player on high settings, installing mods. Also maybe video editing as well. 

* What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes? 

* $850 

* When do you plan on building/buying the PC? 

* Towards the end of June 

* What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc) 

* Everything? All I have now is a laptop, so no monitor, keyboard, or mouse. 

* Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location? 

* Tennessee, US. Closest Microcenter is like over 5 hours away. 

* If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated. 

* None 

* Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU? 

* Not sure. Not really planning on it. 

* Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc) 

* None I can think of

* Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components? 

* None. Would be nice if there was a consistent color theme throughout, but not important. Something sleek looking like blacks, greys, and whites? LEDs would be cool, but these are luxuries, not necessary. 

* Do you already have a copy of Windows 7 or 8, or do you need a copy included with the build? 

* Need Windows 7 

* Extra info if required:  I don't know *anything* about computers. </TEXT>

I only ask because I don't know what to read, or when I'd have time to read. I also ask because I'd hate to buy all the parts I'd need, only to not have time to put it together.

<TEXT> Someone mentioned it in this thread and I think they made a good point. It's not the movies themselves I'm getting burned out on. It's the marketing and attention they get that I'm burned out on. Only a few superhero movies get released a year, which is still a lot more than it use to be. But there is a huge over saturation of marketing involved with them. Everyday it's another article, another picture, another clip, another trailer, another commercial, etc.

I don't think there are too many superhero films, but I *do* think there is *way* too much marketing and attention going into them. A lot more than is necessary. It's not just the marketing team either. It's also fans who post all these things as well. They're not in the wrong, but if they would just pull back on that, I think people would get less burned out. Because, again, there are only 3 of these movies a year usually, but we hear about them and see things about them almost everyday. I think *that's* the problem.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know it's probably an obvious answer for most people, but for me it's not so obvious. I want a gaming pc, but I know nothing about computers or how they work. The task of building one seems unbelievably daunting. Even when I know what to get, putting it together and figuring it out seems beyond intimidating. Even if I did manage to put one together somehow, upgrading also seems intimidating. I don't have a lot of time for building one.

The pros of just getting a console is that it's already made. It's simple. The cons? It's less powerful and a smaller library of games.

The pros of building a pc? More powerful, more games and mods. The cons? Very time consuming and there are a lot of ways I could screw it up.

What should I do based off of what I told you about me?

<TEXT> I think it should be handled like James Bond. With every Bond movie with a new actor, it doesn't start with Bond's origins. It starts with Bond in the middle of some sort of mission.

I think super hero films should start doing this when they reboot. Start the next superhero reboot with the hero already a hero and in the middle of a mission. In doing this, you save yourself thirty minutes or more you'd have to spend with the origin. </TEXT>

As for price, since I'm renting, I can be super flexible with the price. I can work it into our budget. We have like a $1500 budget but rentals really cut the cost down because we're not buying.  </TEXT>

What are some wide angle lenses that don't produce a lot of noise and grain and have a good, clean image? Price really isn't a factor because I'd be renting the lens. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you think Requiem is that depressing, you should watch Martyrs. You'll probably kill yourself.

Also, I forgot to mention it, but A Moment to Remember. It's on Netflix and is about two people who fall in love, but the girl develops Alzheimer's and starts losing her memory. Man, was this an emotionally wrecking film! But I love it and it's such a great movie. You ever need a good cry, watch this.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, that's what's keeping me from watching it, but I love long movies. It's just finding the time that's the problem.

I actually have a few questions about it, if you don't mind.

Is it an epic? Like it takes place over years?

I know you said it's great, but could you tell me why?

How's the cinematography? (weird question, I know, but I'm a sucker for great cinematography.) </TEXT>

Edit: this has nothing to do with Tarantino. I love all of his movies but this only happens when I watch Kill Bill. I can watch his other movies over and over and still love them, but there's just something about the Kill Bill movies.  </TEXT>

Another is Martyrs. This is easily one of the most depressing movies I've seen. I felt sick and ill and depressed watching it. It's seriously just a downhill slope the whole way. Never getting better, but always getting darker, more depressing, and disturbing. I own this film but never intend to watch it ever again, which is rare with me. It just...stuck with me. For days. I felt so hollow and cold after watching it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I watched a Korean film called Marathon. Man, was this movie absolutely great.

Marathon, which is on Netflix, is the true story about a young man with Autism, raised only by his single mother, who finds solace in running. After running a bunch of 5ks, he wants to run a marathon. The whole film is his training for this marathon. 

Holy crap, was this a great movie! The acting was outstanding! It's definitely a tear-jerker, but you'll be crying tears of sadness and joy. This has to be one of the sweetest, most motivating and inspirational movies I've ever seen. I felt so good afterwards. I felt like I could take on anything after watching this! I really, really love this movie. It's great. Just absolutely fantastic.

There's really not a whole lot more I can say about it other than go watch it. It's seriously worth everyone's time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I watched this little indie film on Netflix called The Diary of Preston Plummer. The synopsis Netflix told me was basically, "Preston is a college student with no direction who meets a girl and she asks him to drive her all the way home to Florida." Now I was in a drama mood and I love road trip movies, so I was expecting a lovely, great, road trip drama where these two strangers get to know one another and fall in love.

I was kind of disappointed with what I got though. Instead of a road trip movie. I got a movie that really only took place in one location. The entire road trip was probably like, 10 seconds? This film takes place pretty much entirely in Florida. I only mention this because I believe my wrong expectations may have affected my opinion of it as a whole. Now, don't get me wrong, it was still a decent drama. Just not what I was hoping for.

What it really is, is a story about this guy, Preston, who drives this girl Kate home to Florida from somewhere in the New England area. He agrees because he's looking for adventure and doesn't really know what to do with his life. When they get to Florida, he finds out that her parents own a hotel and allow Preston to stay there for a week free of charge. During this week, Preston and Kate grow close and we learn more about the two of them. Especially Kate, whose family is hiding something about Kate's past from Preston. Preston becomes curious and starts to do some digging. But will his digging bring him and Kate closer, or push them apart?

All in all, it's a really sweet film with some good drama, acting, writing, and beautiful cinematography of Florida. But nothing particularly special or outstanding. It has like a 6 on IMDB, which seems about right. I'd probably give it a 6.5, though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Look, you're right that I *do* have to really look for the "quality" posts. That's kind of my problem. People either downvote or don't vote at all on almost any post that goes against what usually makes it to the front page. Since the content on Reddit is mostly ranked by the users, there's really no solution other than outlawing certain types of posts like it says in the mod message you linked.

True, now isn't the best time to make my criticisms right now, because the mods made that post, so the posts I'm complaining about aren't being made. But what the mods are doing now isn't a permanent solution. At least not yet anyways. In the mod post you linked, it clearly says, "So we're going to try something out for the month of April and see how you guys like it." Emphasis on "*try*". It's not permanent, but hopefully it will be.

You're right, though. I was too harsh on the mods. I'm sure it's difficult running a huge subreddit, and I do appreciate that they are trying to fix things. It was uncalled for, and I apologize to the mods. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're right, I'm not entirely innocent. But I do feel the post I've made here that weren't successful were attempts at creating discussion topics we don't normally see. And it's not just me either. Many people have their deep, fresh, thought provoking posts either downvoted or not voted on at all. Not voting is just as harmful as downvoting. Since this website really only determines what is on the front page by upvotes, if people don't upvote new, refreshing things, we won't see them. And instead, we see super hero posts, poster posts, celebrity gossip posts, and the same generic, rehashed questions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well I don't really think it matters since really no one will see this post. It's been downvoted and because it's not one of the things I listed, even if it was positive, no one would upvote it because it has nothing to do with super heroes, posters, or any of the other stuff that always makes it to the front page.

So in the long run, it doesn't matter if this is what I call "dealing with it" because this post won't change a thing. For the record, I don't call this dealing with it. I call me being quiet about it for years "dealing with it". People complain about this sub all the time in the comments, but no one makes a post about it. Yeah, I went kind of harsh about it and was maybe overly sarcastic and passive-aggressive.

The way I see it, if this post was genuine and I really did love this sub and gave reasons why, I'd still get downvoted, no one would see it because, again, it's not related to super heroes or posters or whatever so it wouldn't make it to the front page, and the few people who would see it would just comment and tell me I was wrong and that it actually sucks. </TEXT>

But seriously, there rally aren't many alternatives. I love film. It's my passion. But most of the people over at truefilm are not really welcoming and are happy to tear you apart at any given moment if you sound uneducated in film. 

There's casualfilm, which is a fantastic subreddit, but unfortunately there's not a lot of activity. Maybe like 3 or 4 post a week. 

There really aren't a lot of alternatives. So it's either unsub and don't get any movie related stuff, or deal with it and get crappy movie related stuff. But I guess we do what we have to do?

<TEXT> Seriously, I love this subreddit! When I first discovered this subreddit, it had a lot of interesting stuff and discussions. I'm glad it's not that anymore. I'm glad it's turned into what it is now! I mean, I love that everyday the front page is just super hero stuff, news and rumors for whatever big blockbuster movie coming out, celebrity gossip, or one of the same 5 questions that get asked every week!

As someone who is afraid of new things and change, it's nice to know there's always /r/movies for when you need a subreddit that doesn't change!

I'm loving that everyday I can see what new poster was released! I love all the "look at all these movies you've seen, but probably haven't" posts we've had an influx of lately! 

But most of all, I'm glad that the only discussion posts making it to the front page are the same questions we see every week! That's the best part. The last thing I want is an original or thought provoking discussion on my /r/movies front page!

But, yeah, just wanted you all to know how much I love this subreddit! Whatever it is you're doing, mods, keep doing it! It's working perfectly! This is a fantastic sub because of it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I saw Panic Room again for like the fourth time. I really love this movie. It's such a tight thriller with no fat on it. It's just under two hours and doesn't take a brake. Unlike Contracted, which takes 40 minutes for things to pick up, Panic Room takes only 15 minutes for things to pick up. 

This a very solid movie. Not David Fincher's best, but it's one of my favorite Fincher movies. I'm actually shocked by how many people don't like this movie. Especially average movie goers. On IMDB it has a 6.3. Now I know IMDB isn't the judge of quality but a lot of its voters are your casual movie fans. This movie really seems like it would've been popular with a wide variety of people. It's thrilling, well directed and acted, and is shot beautifully. It's so easy to watch because the pacing is also great. 

I highly recommend this to any David Fincher fans or anyone looking for a great, tight thriller.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I watched this new movie recommended to me called Contracted. It's a body horror film. I wanted to watch it because I love body horror stuff. The friend that recommended it to me said it was super knarly and disturbing. When I heard this I immediately imagined a Cronenberg-esque movie with gross special effects. 

This movie was absolutely terrible. Like in just about every way. The story they tried to force in there was bland and boring. The acting was over dramatic. The writing was atrocious, and the characters were UNBELIEVABLY STUPID. I have never been so angry with characters before in my life. Nothing they said or did made any sort of sense. For example, and this isn't a spoiler, when the main character starts showing extreme physical deformities, EVERYONE asks if she's okay and she'll say,"Oh yeah I'm fine." And they all believe her. Can you not see she is seriously fucked up!!!

The only reason I wanted to see it was for some sick body horror and special effects. It didn't even deliver on those. Nothing really disturbing happens to her without spoiling it. The body horror stuff doesn't even start for 40 minutes. The first 40 minutes is literally just character set up. Which I understand because it is a movie after all, but they try to make you care for these characters by doing a terrible job forcing in love stories. I found myself not caring about anyone because they are all really dumb terrible people. 

This movie is boring, very poor, and isn't worth anyone's time. It's hard to even recommend to people who like horror or body horror movies because it doesn't even do well in those departments.  </TEXT>

It gives most the movies, besides November/December movies, time to drop in price so that every movie I buy isn't $25. Instead, they're more like $10-15 each, which I can feel less guilty about. </TEXT>

The Matrix was such a masterpiece of action and sci-fi and had such a massive impact on culture that there was no way Reloaded could ever out do the first one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's exactly what I mean when I say he's unwilling to compromise. I was telling him just what you said and he disagreed and told me sometimes the older styles are better. 

I totally get wanting to follow in the steps and try and replicate a great director, but his determination to do this makes him very cliche and "copy and paste", and gives him no identity. No custom style. And if we want our projects to get noticed and stand out, we have to *stand out* and do something different. 

I probably sound like a douche talking about my friend because he *is* smart and very passionate about filmmaking. 

But yeah anyways. I'm not that far from you(barely). I'm in Tennessee. Not a lot of film community here.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like to do more darker, bleak, surreal stuff like crime stories or dramas. He's a huge Spilberg fanboy, which is fine cause he's a good director, but it's really causing us to butt heads because he wants to do more feelgood, textbook style filming, which again, is fine. 

I like more modern movies and the only movies he has seen and love are pre 1990 stuff. Which in turn causes him to want to do dated and cliched stories and story beats. 

It's hard to explain, but his demeanor feels very much like he "owes" the "classics" so he tries to replicate that "classic" feel which honestly doesn't really work today. It really feels like he only loves classic movies because he feels like he's obligated to because every filmmaker is only suppose to like old movies. 

Anytime I bring up modern movies or modern trends and styles, he rolls his eyes and calls them inferior to the "classics".  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well I'm 7 days late but thought I'd still talk.

I'm in sort of the same situation. Filmmaker as well. However I do have at least one friend who I've been working with frequently. The problem is we are very different in our tastes and styles and he is unwilling to compromise, so we have started to hit walls when trying to come up with ideas.

I'm trying to broaden the amount of people to work with, but everyone else isn't as serious about it as I am. Everyone just wants to do it for fun, which is fine for them, but I want to make a career out of it whereas they have other careers in mind(doctor, lawyer, etc.,). So this leads to situations where I either have to work with my stubborn, uncompromising friend or work with people who goof off too much and don't care.

Too bad you and I don't live near each other(as far as I know. I'm assuming.). We seem to share the same interest.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> FCP 7. I don't know what my sequence/project settings are or the export/master file settings.

I have run into another problem though. So on this project I have put 30 hours into, I accidentally closed the sequence timeline. Now the timeline won't open for this specific project unless I create a new project and drag the sequence into this new timeline. Problem is, when I do this it makes it all one big sequence where I can't see the beginning or ending of clips. I also have to re-render everything which will take two hours.

How can I fix this mistake? Can I even fix it? I just want to edit independent clips again without having to re-edit every single thing all over again. Did I royally screw up?

Edit: Never mind about the timeline thing. Fixed it! But I do still need help exporting. How do I check the settings? </TEXT>

I've watched so many different tutorials about exporting, all with the same result, Bad Quality. For some reason I just can't get it to work. It's so irritating. 

The worst part is that I've exported a video that came out in high quality before, but I can't get this video I just did to come out in HD at all for some reason.

Can someone please, please help?  </TEXT>

The first 300 only really used cgi for the background, blood, and the cases where that's the only option(like the army of millions of Persians and the creatures) but even then it wasn't terrible. The cgi in Rise of an Empire felt very fake and a lot of the time unnecessary.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I'm definitely in the minority here based on the rest of these comments. 

I found this movie kind of boring. I don't know why but I never got into it at all. 

The blood looked super terrible. I think it might have been worse than the blood in the first one, which evaporated in the air. Like it was very distracting how bad it was. 

The cinematography was mediocre. You know how that show Spartacus felt like a cheap rip off of 300 when it came out? That's how this one felt, a cheap rip off. I found it very hard to tell what was going on at any time because of the either too dark lighting, or too bright and bloomy lighting. 

I feel like this isn't hardly half the movie the first one was. I was more interested in this movie when it was called Xerxes and was about his origins which was only 10 minutes of this movie. 

All in all I thought it was very poor and a disappointing sequel to one of my favorite movies. Again, I know I'm in the minority here but these are just my thoughts on it.  </TEXT>

I just simply don't have the time to learn about audio and have an entire day or more of trial and error figuring out how to make it all work. 

I'm not saying your input is bad, any and all input is greatly appreciated, I'm just trying to figure out if the Bose is a decent sound system, not compared to something I could build better, but as far as packaged home systems go.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks! Another question, how worth it is general admission? I know this is more of a personal preference sort of thing but how much more am I going to get out of the show if I do GA vs regular seating? Is it worth waiting in line all day, to you personally? It's just that I've never done GA before. 

You also said if I showed up later, I'd get the back. How terrible is the back of GA? Last one, is there a chance that if I showed up late for GA that they'd run out of room and I wouldn't get in?

Again sorry for all the questions. You're very helpful! </TEXT>

Or can I chow up at 8 am, get a ticket, leave, then come back when the show starts? Also, how much are GA tickets?

Sorry for bombarding you with questions, you just seem like you know. Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I choose a movie based on what my mood is at that time. Like am I in the mood for crime, action, comedy, etc. as well as sub-genre stuff like dark movies, violent, gritty, depressing, fast paced, light-hearted, etc.

A good way to find subgenres is Netflix. You can find a vast list of sub-genres or you can find a movie you've seen that is close to what you want to watch in tone and Netflix will say "This movie is: Violent, dark, etc." and will tell you what tone it is. You can then click on, let's say "dark" if I wanted to watch a dark movie, and Netflix will list all of the movies it has for instant that are categorized as dark.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I completely agree that sequels work for comic book movies. It makes sense. I'm just saying for me personally I'm not a huge fan of sequels. 

And as for comic book movies taking over original films. I guess I just meant adaptations and remakes in general. As the years go on, the number of original films are getting smaller and smaller. Everything is based on a comic or book or a remake or sequel or reboot. I can't say I blame Hollywood. If I knew a specific thing would sell, I'd make it too. 

And again, adaptations of comic books and remakes and what not wouldn't bother me if they did something interesting with them. But they all feel the same which makes me feel jaded towards them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not really into them honestly. They aren't bad though. I really love the Nolan Batmans though because they didn't *feel* like a comic book movie, if that makes sense. When they first made an impression in like 2008 I liked them but I feel like now there is just such an over saturation of them. Honestly for me, my main problem is the fact that they are sequels and adaptations. It sounds shallow, but I'd much rather see an original film than another Marvel or DC movie. But it wasn't this way like 5 or 6 years ago because there weren't so many. We use to get super hero stuff like every two years or so. Now we get them every year. Sometimes two or more a year. 

I also don't like, and this is more a flaw with Hollywood than super hero films themselves, that producers are just looking for properties and franchises to adapt or remake simply because they know it will sell, thus creating less and less original content. These days, comic book movies are replacing original films. It used to be adaptations were made along side original films. Now it feels they are taking the place of original films. Again though, this is more a problem with Hollywood. 

I'm not totally against super hero stuff as long as they change it up or do something interesting with it. That's why I loved the Nolan Batmans. But now, every Marvel movie looks the same and every DC movie looks the same. They all look and feel the same. That combined with how frequently we see them makes them feel super dull and dry to me. 

Like 10 years ago, I'd be so pumped for the next super hero movie. Now, they just aren't special anymore. At least to me it feels that way.  </TEXT>

Films that are just as great and just as powerful no matter the format, no matter the screen size. I agree that Gravity will lose a lot of its powerfulness with its transition to small screens.

<TEXT> I watched a movie called [Three O'Clock High](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094138/?ref_=nv_sr_1). I love love *love* this movie. It's about your average high schooler, Jerry Mitchell, who finds himself challenged to fight the new guy, Buddy Revell.

Buddy is the new guy who, according to rumors, is a psychopath. He doesn't like to be touched. The last guy who touched him had his arm broken. Buddy is your typical bad boy. He wars boots, jeans, black leather jacket, and a white t-shirt. When Jerry Mitchell introduces himself, he puts his foot in his mouth and can tell he's making Buddy angry. In an attempt to fix the situation, Jerry asks if they can start over and gives Buddy a nice friendly pat on the shoulder. Psycho Buddy warns Jerry of what he's done and tells him that they are going to fight in the parking lot at 3 o'clock. Jerry then spends the movie trying to get out of it by any means possible.

This movie is exceptionally well made. The pacing, directing, and camera work are all absolutely fantastic.It's such an easy movie to watch because of how well paced it is. We constantly aware of what time it is and how much time Jerry has left. I cannot stress enough how fantastically well made this movie is. It's so much fun.

The thematic elements we see and hear throughout the film are really well done. For example, Jerry is in Biology and watching the Wonderful World of Insects. We hear the narrator describing the grasshopper who is going about his day and is preyed upon by the large crab scorpion. Another instance in English when we hear about the gladiator battles.

All in all this movie is great. If you're a fan of movies that take place in a day, this is one of the best ones. It's well made with fantastic direction and the pacing is great. It's an immensely fun movie and I highly recommend it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So just yesterday I watched [Exam](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1258197/?ref_=nv_sr_1) which is about a group of people who are all competing for a high ranking job at a top of the line company. They must decide whether to work together or alone in order to figure out the simple yest complicated test they are given that puts them to their limits.

This film is a very tight psychological mystery. It opens with eight applicants who enter a testing room. They are greeted by their test giver who gives them a few simple rules to follow. They are told there is one question and only one answer. However they must figure out what the question is as well as the answer in under 80 minutes.

We spend the movie in an almost real-time fashion watching these people trying to solve this strange mystery. It's hard to describe without spoiling it, and this is not something you want spoiled. The acting is mostly good while occasionally, but rarely, coming off as hammy. The writing is pretty tight while rarely being cheesy. The stand out in this film is the story.

This is a very interesting mystery puzzle of a story. Why are these people here? What's the job? What's the company? Why is the application process like this? What's the question? What's the answer? Over the course of the movie we watch them slowly try to solve these questions. The writers did a great job of creating this quasi-futuristic world and the conflicts it faces. Again, it's hard to talk about without spoiling.

While watching this I got two vibes from it. Cube and Reservoir Dogs. Two very different movies. 

I seriously recommend checking this out. Especially if you love a great mystery. It's on Netflix instant.     </TEXT>

<TEXT> A few days ago I watched [The Iceman](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1491044/?ref_=nv_sr_1) in which Michael Shannon plays notorious mob hitman Richard Kuklinski.

I thought the movie was very interesting. I had never heard about Kuklinski before I saw the movie so it was all new information for me which made it that much better because I didn't know a thing. The writing was pretty good as well as the directing, but what really stands out is the acting. Michael Shannon, as always, is extremely powerful in this role. He is seriously one of the best actors working today. Shannon is joined by Winona Ryder, Chris Evans, Ray Liotta, and a surprising David Schwimmer. Everyone in the cast does a great job. The stand outs were obviously Shannon and Chris Evans, or at least for me they were. It was nice to see Schwimmer in a *very* different role than normal. However, I kind of chuckled at Ray Liotta. Not because he was bad, Liotta is solid in this. I chuckled because Ray Liotta has to be one of the most typecasted actors today. I'm sure 90 percent of his career is gangster/mob stuff. Not that I'm complaining.

It's easy to overestimate an actors performance, but this movie is great because of Shannon. Without him I think it would have been just good. 

I got a Zodiac vibe from it. Mostly because they are both period piece crime films that take place over a decade. Which brings me to the other thing that stood out to me. The costume and set design. I totally felt that I was there in the 60s and 70s.

All in all I strongly recommend checking this out if you haven't. It's seriously a great film that really shows how powerful Michael Shannon is on screen. His presence is almost God-like in its power. It's on Netflix instant so give it a watch sometime.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> But that's sort of what I'm getting at. Movies *are* a visual media but I don't think that should mean visuals should come first. I'm not saying that Gravity's visuals come first, but it sure appears that way when the visuals drown out the story. Story is important. Especially if we're talking Best Picture. It's perfectly okay for a story to be simple. But there's a difference between simple and shallow. Children of Men wasn't even nominated in any acting categories, best picture or director. I may be in the minority here, but I believe Children of Men is a league above Gravity. Best picture should be a well rounded film, which I honestly don't think Gravity is. But again that said, I still think Gravity is a technological achievement in film.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never criticized Gravity's story. I never said it was bad, I just simply said it was similar to Avatar and American Hustle in that the story wasn't the best part.  The thing about Gravity is that it's okay to have a simple story. But it felt like the story wasn't important. You could tell that the tech was more important. When you have complex and bombastic tech and visuals, it overshadows the simple story. The story wasn't just simple, it was kind of flat. A story can be simple, but I feel it needs depth. Great stories are not determined by how complex or simple they are, but how much depth they have.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Just some thoughts on Gravity </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-02-02 02:56:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So when I was looking at the awards poster for Gravity that was posted on here I started thinking. I found Gravity to be one of the most technically impressive movies I've ever seen and it is an accomplishment. But I can't help but feel that it's a little over-hyped.

I find myself reminded of Avatar. Avatar is a technically impressive film of the same caliber as Gravity, I feel. Yet Avatar's plot was "meh". I feel the same about Gravity. Again, it's a technically remarkable film, but I feel that that's really all it has going for it. The acting is good and the plot is also kind of "meh".

Today, Avatar is a movie we don't think about to often, and while impressive on a big screen, it loses a lot of that impressiveness on a small, home tv. Going back to the awards poster for Gravity, one of the quotes says, "A groundbreaking film that must be seen in Imax 3D." Which is exactly like Avater. I worry that Gravity will not be as impressive on smaller screens resulting in a less powerful film because Gravity does rely a lot on its technical aspects.

I'm also reminded of American Hustle in a way. The general consensus here is that American Hustle has great acting but a "meh" plot, and a film shouldn't be considered great based on just one aspect of it. I think the same could be said for Gravity. The strongest, and really the only thing it has going for it, is its technical achievements. Now, I do realize that Gravity and American Hustle are two different beasts. And I do want to say that I'm not hating on Gravity because I think it's a really good film that has made incredible leaps in its technology. These are just observations I've made.

Edit: Just wanted to point out that Children of Men wasn't even nominated for any acting categories, best picture or director.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In all honesty I'd love to see Zac Efron in a really different role. Like something other than a comedy or romance movie. I think he is a talented actor, but he keeps choosing roles that are pretty boy roles. He wants to break from High School musical. He came close with the Paperboy, but he keeps playing the pretty boy. He needs to pick a role that will change his image or force him to play more than a pretty boy. Something like Christian Bales American Psycho.

Another talented actor is Robert Pattinson. Twilight may be terrible, but he was not the problem with them. He's good in what ever he does, but he keeps getting bad roles. Luckily The Rover looks really promising. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Movies and movie making. I guess it partly has to do with the escapism aspect of watching a movie. For two hours I can disappear into another world.

I love filmmaking because I love making stories and ideas a reality. I love telling stories visually. I'm good at it, and I've never really been good at anything really. When I make a film, I'm *creating art*. Which is so cool to me. I'm making something. I'm making an idea I had a reality. I'm bringing this idea to life and making it a physical thing.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My buns and thighs. I'm like the only guy I know who gains weight in his butt and thighs. All the other guys gain in their stomach or waist. I hate having a big booty.

Also, my face. I'm hairy everywhere else: my head, chest, arms, legs, butt, and nether regions. But for some reason I simply *cannot* grow facial hair of any kind. I'm in my twenties and I look like a chubby sixteen year old. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A Moment to Remember, a Korean film. I bawl my eyes out every time I watch it. It tells a story of a man and women who fall passionately in love, but their love is put to the greatest test when [Spoiler](/s "his wife develops Alzheimer's, develops dementia, and starts losing her memory. The last thirty minutes of it rips your heart right out.") 

Sounds cheesy, but it's executed perfectly and feels genuine and never comes off as cheesy or hoakey.

<TEXT> There's a lot to pick from, but I really really love The Tree of Life. I think it's an incredible achievement in film. The fact that it can tell this ambitious, yet small story set across a cosmic, "greater power" background is incredible. This movie is very divisive I only know one person personally who liked it while the other people I know who saw it thought it was bad.

I saw it with my mother and we both cried. We could both relate to the story. I had a strict father who I knew loved me, but had a hard time showing it, and as a result I was closer to my mother than my father. The movie really resonated and affected me probably more than any other movie I saw. It's a beautiful film that tells a beautiful story and has gorgeous cinematography, visual effects, and music. With acting that reminds you that great acting doesn't have to be explicit, it can also be subtle.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right now it's Tarantino and Christoph Waltz. Mainly because I think they are a match made in heaven and it clearly comes across on screen. I wish they had gotten together earlier in their careers though. The more films they do together, the better.

Another match made in heaven are Nicolas Winding Refn and Ryan Gossling as well as Winding Refn and Cliff Martinez, his choice composer.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. 12 Years a Slave - I've heard quite a bit of criticism about this film being "pretentious", "self-indulgent", and "over rated". I love Steve McQueen and think he is a fantastic director. 12 Years is almost a perfect movie that I think will be considered a classic. I like how it was unflinching in its portrayal of slavery. We've often seen the hard labor and verbal abuse slaves endured, but never really the physical abuse. It also has some of the best acting I've seen.

2. The Place Beyond the Pines - Another movie that has received quite a bit of criticism, more so than 12 Years. I absolutely loved how this film almost felt like a stage play. How it was clearly broken into three acts. I think the acting, directing, and music are great. Could this movie have been better? I guess, but I still thought it was fantastic. I also really loved the father-son aspect of it. I'm super close to my father and this film really resonated with me and affected me emotionally more than any film this past year.

3. Only God Forgives - Probably the most divisive movie of the year. Heavily criticized for it's lack of story and plot. I think the minimalist thing works for this film though. What it lacks in substance, it more than makes up for in style. I love Nicolas Winding Refn because he's unafraid to make the kind of movies we don't usually see. He doesn't care if you like his movies and that gives him more freedom. Only God Forgives probably has the best cinematography, set design, and score that I saw in a film last year. This movie isn't for everyone though so I understand why it's a divisive film. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I'm 20 and I've only had two jobs. One was for a place I worked at for only a month before leaving for school. I went to school for a year. Then I got another job. I had every intention of keeping this job. However I was laid off after only a month because "they couldn't afford to keep me on."

My question is, when applying for a job, should I leave off the second job? My mother said I should because it makes me look bad because it looks like I quit jobs after only a month. But I said I *should* put my second job because experience is experience, even if it is just an extra month.

Is putting on the second job on applications hurting my chances of getting a job? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not saying critics are always right. I love plenty of movies critics call "terrible." But ratings act as a guideline for people. Most people don't have the time to pick just any movie and hope its good. They want it to be worth their time. They want to know it will be good. The unfortunate truth is that a lot of horror movies are poorly rated, which hurts the genre. Now smaller, creative, and good horror movies don't get seen. Critics are most definitely not always right, but they do have a HUGE influence on what people watch.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree, but I think the way to do it is to set up jump scares that don't happen. Here's a comment I made earlier. 

"See the thing about jump scares is that they are only suppose to happen twice. Once at the beginning and once at the end. The point of the first one is to put the audience on edge. Showing them that anything can pop out at any minute. What makes this effective is that by not having a jump scare again, you put the audience in suspense of something that won't happen again. That's why the jump scare is genius. You make them think it can happen at anytime but don't. The point of the second and final jump scare is for the payoff. Now that the audience has been waiting the entire time for the next jump scare, they let their guard down because it's been like an hour or so. That's when you let loose the second and final jump scare.

That's how jump scares are suppose to work, but people instead decide to make that the scary part and put them in every 5-10 minutes." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I dunno. I always felt comedy is the hardest because it's the most subjective and broadest subject. I feel like it's pretty universal what most consider scary and horrific. Sure, there are specific phobias like heights, spiders, the ocean, etc that some find scary that others don't. But I think everyone can agree that murderers, creatures, and being alone in a dark haunted place is scary. I do think however that it's easier to creep people out than to all out scare them. I personally find subtle stuff like shadows moving in the background or footprints leading under the bed far more scarier than "in your face" stuff.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Inside, Martyrs, and The Devil's Backbone are fantastic! But Martyrs felt less like a horror movie and more like a depressing drama with horrific things happening to this person. Which I guess now that I've written that out could be considered a horror movie.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> True, but I feel like with action and rom-coms, we may rarely see great ones, but we kinda consistently see decent ones. Whereas with horror, it's rare to come across even decent ones. Especially horror movies made by big studios.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Serious question here. Why are horror movies generally bad? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-19 10:17:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I started thinking about this while browsing the horror section of Netflix. There tends to be a lot more horror movies that are bad compared to other genres. In fact, it's quite rare we see good horror movies anymore. Horror movies tend to hang around a 6 or below on IMDB or a 50 or below on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic. The most recent good horror movie I can think of is The Conjuring. Which had a great first 3 quarters, but the last quarter turned into a pretty generic possession scene.

Why is this the case? What's the cause of this? Is it the over saturation of them? Is it because they're generally easier to make on a low budget or what? It seems like the only truly good horror movies, with a few exceptions, are foreign now. Is it because most directors/writers/producers believe that story, acting, writing, and character development aren't as important in the horror genre? </TEXT>

<TEXT> [The Divide](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1535616/?ref_=nv_sr_2)

A movie about a group of people who take shelter in a basement after a nuclear attack. As days go by, their mental, emotional, and physical states start breaking down. It's a great scifi drama that focuses on the conflict between these people. Criminally underrated and filled with fantastic acting, music, and cinematography.

[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLpieSNIfk). Kind of cheesy trailer that doesn't due justice to the movie. </TEXT>

<TEXT> At a 5.8, the lowest I have is The Divide. Not super low because I actively avoid getting bad movies unless I love them. I love this movie. I wouldn't even call it bad. This is a REALLY good sci fi movie. It's about a group of people who retreat into a small bomb shelter during a nuclear war. The more time they spend in the shelter, the crazier and more unhinged they become.

It's not the best movie, but it has some fantastic acting, music, and cinematography. It all takes place in the shelter. Some want to go out. Others obviously don't. Who will break? Who will survive?

This movie also takes some interesting turns as the peoples mental, emotional, and physical state break down.

I came to own it after watching it online. I was looking for something to watch and it looked good, but I was not expecting what I got. After watching it, I had to take some time to let it sink in. It stuck with me days after I saw it. There is a haircut scene that was one of the best scenes of that year. It's a dark, bleak, and emotionally draining movie.

I would totally recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys sci fi that is more about the human drama and how humans react to disaster and tragedy. It's one of my favorite movies I own and it's so good. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think while Gravity was remarkable technically, I think it is the weakest contender for best picture. There really isn't a lot of substance there that *I* could see story wise and the writing was okay. But I think the other films are all around great not just technically, but also story wise, acting wise, writing, etc. I just think the other noms are more well rounded. 

That said, Gravity should take all technical awards.  </TEXT>

It would've been nice to see Place Beyond the Pines get a nod, but it's a stiff competition so there was really no room for it. 

All in all though I think there is a good bit of variety this year with the noms. Only thing I wish there was less of is American Hustle.  </TEXT>

But that's kind of the thing. When you're a kid, like really young, you don't really understand that what a bully says isn't true. You're impressionable and you take it to heart. It isn't really until you're in your teens you start to learn to let things roll off your back.

But again, I kind of agree with you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I dunno dude. I went to school with a guy who killed himself. He had severe social anxiety as well as aspergers. He couldn't handle social stuff very well. This led to harsh bullying which led to depression. He eventually stopped going to school because he couldn't handle it and one day took his life.

There *are* some people who just are *not* in the right frame of mind.

I don't know though, maybe you're right, but sometimes there *are* other elements at play that mess with your head. Sometimes it isn't just depression. The human mind is a crazy thing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think because it was one of the first movies to take an extraordinary situation and make it ordinary. Pulp Fiction was one of the first movies to be filled with dialogue and conversations that normal people would have. They were realistic. Not everything they said was important to the story or was dramatic. A lot of people don't like the whole "talk about nothing" style. But I loved it. It made it feel more realistic. In the beginning, Travolta and Jackson aren't talking about anything important or meaningful. They're talking about tv and fast food.

But on top of all that, it's just a well written, well acted, and well directed movie. </TEXT>

Well Jesus was whipped and had a crown of thorns placed on his head and, apparently, bled from every pore. He was covered in blood, yet when he was resurrected his scars were gone and the blood was clean from his body.

You're exactly right. We *do* have to consider that maybe other religions are right.

Look, I'm just going to assume that you have no intention of coming to any sort of agreement and you just want to argue. I'm trying to compromise with you, but you won't. I can't tell if you're asking these questions and pointing this stuff out because you actually want explanations or because you're trying to prove that all Gods and religions are all just a lie.

I loved Wolf of Wall Street, but depending on who you see it with, it can get pretty uncomfortable. If you're going with family or a girlfriend/boyfriend, I'd say Lone Survivor. But if you're going with a buddy, you can't go wrong with either. I loved Wolf of Wall Street *and* Lone Survivor. But I thought Lone Survivor was more entertaining. That's just me though.

Also, there is Receiver. Receiver is an ultra realistic shooter. In the game, you have to operate your gun like you would a real one. Taking it off safety, counting bullets, putting bullets in magazines, cocking it, etc. It makes for some really tense gameplay.

<TEXT> Fuck.

It doesn't really make sense. In fact, a lot of the time "fuck" and its derivatives are frequently used purely to bridge thoughts and sentences. 

There are plenty of words we could say in it's place, but it *is* useful to express certain emotions. It's the same with any swear word really. They don't make a lot of sense, there are plenty of words that could be said in their place, but they do a good job of expressing certain emotions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In person? I saw a dead cat. But the way I saw it was like something out of a movie.

I was asked to take care of my neighbor's cat while she was gone for Christmas. One day I went over and saw Mulligan, that's the cat's name, sitting in the bedroom with foamy drool hanging from his mouth and he was making weird noises. I took him to the vet and the vet said it's probably just stress and to not worry about it. "It might go away when the owner gets back."

So a few days later I walk over to my neighbors house to feed him and check up on him. I opened the door and the whole house is silent except for the Beethoven-esque music playing on the radio(we turned the radio on to keep Mulligan company). So this beautiful orchestra music is playing and I look down the hall and all I see is his tail sticking out. I called his name and he didn't respond.

I walked down the hall and there was Mulligan, dead. He was laying next to his toy, too. I checked to see if he was breathing and maybe just passed out. He was stiff as a plank of wood. He was gone at least 12 hours.

The whole thing was very eerie and morbid with the quiet calm house and this beautiful orchestra music echoing through the house. Sad day. Apparently he had a stroke.

I also hit a golden retriever once with my car when I was in high school. That was a tough day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Look, I'm not saying that until we have evidence to disprove it, it's true. I'm saying that until we have evidence to disprove it we shouldn't rule it out.

Something may be ridiculous and unlikely, but that's not enough reason to say it's impossible. Not without evidence. Like I said, the lack of evidence that something *does* exist is not the same thing as having evidence that it *doesn't* exist. 

But you're right. It is a two way street. The lack of evidence that something *doesn't* exist is not the same thing as having evidence that it *does* exist. 

*That's* what I'm saying. No matter how ridiculous something is, without evidence to prove or disprove it, we can't rule it out.

I'm about to throw down another bad analogy. How do we know the sky is blue? Well, through science we know, but let's try another way for the sake of this analogy. A way to know would be to survey thousands of people. If you asked 10,000 people what color the sky is, it's safe to say all 10,000 will say "blue". So it's safe to say that the sky is in fact blue. I mean, how can that many people be wrong, right? Again, bad analogy, but it's the best way I can describe it.

It's kinda the same thing with the Bible. It's full of first hand accounts and testimonies of various people who have come in contact with God and/or Jesus and witnessed their, for lack of a better word, "powers". There *are* witnesses who saw Jesus heal the sick and afflicted. Now *how* he did this and the veracity of it is up to interpretation. But there *are* records of not only Jesus healing people, but also being resurrected. Around a hundred people *witnessed* Jesus being crucified and killed. And a few days later they saw him. Alive. Free of any scars except for the nail holes. Now again, *how* he did this and the veracity of it is up to interpretation, but there is a record of it happening. How could all of these people in the Bible be wrong and crazy? I don't know. But for right now, we have to kinda consider that maybe the Bible is accurate. Even if it is crazy.

<TEXT> But like I said, my Bigfoot analogy was really dumb. It wasn't meant to be taken literally, it was meant to just put in perspective the whole thing. 

And also like I said, if you believe the Bible to be true, then there *is* proof. It's all written there. That's why I used Bigfoot as an analogy. Because the only proof we have are first hand accounts people have. Just like the Bible is firsthand accounts of people's interactions with God and Jesus. But again, this all goes back to faith. It's up to you, and only you to decide whether to believe it or not. And if you don't want to believe, fine, that's okay. That's your choice. 

But you should never rule anything out. We as a human race don't know everything. We are incredibly smart and have made massive advancements, but we still have so much to learn. 

I've said this in another thread but I'll say it here. The lack of evidence that something *does* exist is not the same thing as having evidence that it *doesn't* exist. Until we have evidence to disprove something, we should never rule it out. *That's* science.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Then like I also said, if you're the kind of person who needs proof of everything, then there's really nothing anyone can do to convince you. 

No one has any physical evidence of God. Yet you ask for it knowing no one has it. Which leads me to believe that you simply don't want to believe.

So let me ask you: Do you want to believe? Because if the answer is "no" then there is no point in you asking people for evidence. Because there is nothing anyone can say or do to convince you. And maybe you simply don't want to be convinced, and that's okay, because that's what you want. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know if this sheds any light on anything or helps at all, but that is kind of what religion is about. Religion is all about faith. If God came down in the flesh right now in front of everyone and showed us some Godlike powers and we all believed that this was the actual God, then it would eliminate the need for faith. We'd have proof that he exists. Full, undeniable proof.

Depending on what faith you choose to believe, if any, the reason we are here is to receive a body. A physical body. We wanted a body to be more like God and Jesus because they have physical bodies. Before the Earth was created, we were all in heaven. We were presented with two plans. One was by Satan in which we would be forced to do things on Earth against our will. The other plan, presented by Jesus, was we had free agency on Earth. There was a war in Heaven and those who sided with Satan were cast out of Heaven with him. But those who did side with Satan have a chance at redemption, which is a different discussion.

Anyway, those who sided with God and Jesus came to Earth. Here on Earth we not only received a physical body, but free will as well. This brings in the other reason why we are here: To be tested. To have our love for God tested. To have our faith tested. Now that we have free will, do we choose the way of God or Satan? Do we even believe in a God? This is basically our love and faith being tested.

If we have undeniable proof of God, then we don't have faith, we have science. And if we have science, proof of something, then there is no reason to have faith in it because we know beyond a reasonable doubt that it's true. This is a really dumb example, but God and heaven and all that stuff is sort of like Bigfoot. We don't have undeniable proof of his existence, but we have first hand accounts and testimonies of those who claim to have interacted with him. Those who choose to believe in Bigfoot are going on faith. The Bible, should you choose to believe it, is kind of like first hand accounts and records of people who have come in contact with religious experiences and Jesus and what not. 

This all goes back to the core component of religion. Faith. It sounds unreliable, and if you're the kind of person who needs proof of everything then there's really nothing anyone can do to convince you. You just have to have faith.

I hope I helped, even if it is just a little bit.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm curious about what event in your life led you to have such a vendetta against Mormonism. Why can't Mormons believe what they want? Why does what they do bother you so much? 

I just fail to understand why you feel the need to ridicule an entire religion. It shouldn't matter whether you believe what they do or not, or if you think they are ignorant. You don't go around saying people's religions are based off of lies. Religion is supposed to revolve around faith, not facts. Religion is all about worshiping Gods we can't prove exist. So even if you don't believe what Mormons believe is real or true, it doesn't matter. It's real to them. 

Also, why do you care so much? Do you believe you will be the great hero to all ignorant Mormons? The one who will wake them all up and make them see the error of their ways? </TEXT>

The Tree of Life. I grew up in a very religious family. A family sort of like the one in the movie. I was super close to my mother and my father was a hard worker, so he wasn't around much. He was stern, didn't say much, and had a hard time showing his love for anyone. We all knew he loved us, but had a hard time saying or showing it. I saw the movie with my mother and we both cried. It was a very beautiful film about family, life, death, faith, and what it all means. </TEXT>

What I mean is, have you ever thought of something or tried to remember something and then you think, "I can't remember if this was from a movie or book or dream."

There's a word for it. When you think of something and you think you're creating it from scratch but subconsciously you're pulling it from you memories of, in this case, a book.

<TEXT> I'm late but I wanted to give my personal thoughts on it. There have been some great advice on here already as well as not so great. But here are my thoughts. 

I feel like if two people love each other, and I mean really love each other, they will understand if one of them wants to wait. I feel like they wouldn't throw away their relationship with you if you don't do it. 

Also I feel there are more important things I want in a relationship than sex. Now is sex important? Yes I feel it is. But I don't think you can base your decision of whether you love someone or not on sex. I want a girl that I can have deep intense conversations with and I can feel comfortable being vulnerable around them. If I find a girl like that and we love each other, and she tells me she wants to wait, I'm not going to throw it all away.  It doesn't mean she loves me less. 

But this is all just my feelings on this.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You need to get your expectations straight before you see OGF. It's not Drive. Visually it's similar, but Drive is a lot more straight forward and easier to watch. If you go into OGF with the expectations that it's like Drive you won't enjoy it as much. It is incredibly slow. It takes its time. More so than Drive. It is more like Refn's Valhalla Rising. I'd say that if you like Drive than there is a good chance you'll like OGF, just don't expect it to be another Drive. If you don't mind movies that take their time and are really slow, then give it a watch. </TEXT>

Finding out what the movie was, was sort of like solving a mystery. The same with Cloverfield. Strange teaser. Cryptic website.

For example, my teacher is telling us that one of our citations has to be from this documentary we watched about The Black Power sign showcased at the 1968 Olympics. So I didn't really know how to use a movie as a source.

How exactly do I use a movie as a source? Can I put in a quote from someone that they said within the film and consider that a proper citation of the movie? Like for instance if someone said, "The stunt they pulled at the Olympics in 1968 is what propelled the Black Power Movement forward." If I put that quote in my essay, is that a proper way to use a movie as a source?

I really need help figuring out how to use this movie as a source. It's literally all I have left to do in my essay, and I cannot figure how how to do it properly. I've never used a movie as a source. Help? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It doesn't have to be something exactly $50,000, but just think of it as that's how much you have at your disposal to spend on someone. 

Edit: Screw it! I can't change the title so I'll put in this edit. I'm raising the limit to $500,000. I want to see what you guys come up with. I want o see how much good you can do. And so you don't have to rack your brain trying to figure out how to spend every penny of it, let's say you can do whatever you want with whatever is left over. Blow it, put it in the bank or whatever. But I don't want to hear what you'll do with what's left, I want to hear how you'll use that money for good. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think there's more than that involved when it comes to Oscar bait. When I think of Oscar bait I think: period piece, usually biopic, has an ensemble cast, they alter their appearance somehow, and is usually directed by an Oscar nominated director. 

Things like The Kings Speech, The Artist, Lincoln, and even though it isn't out yet, American Hustle is looking that way. Now does Oscar bait mean "bad"? I don't think so. All those movies I listed are great. And even American Hustle looks good.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm the same way. I find myself playing devil's advocate a lot when talking about people with a group of friends. I don't like talking about someone behind their back. It feels...weird. It feels like I'm betraying them. I just can't do that. And if I do start to talk about someone, I feel bad midway through my sentence and back out before any damage is done. I guess it's because my parents always told me to "treat everyone like they are having a harder time than you." I don't know what kind of life this person has when I'm not around. I don't know what problems this person might be dealing with. And insulting them, whether it be to their face or behind their back, doesn't solve anything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whenever 2004s Crash is brought up, almost everyone says it was terrible and "utter shit". I mean, it's not the best movie, and it shouldn't have won Best Picture that year, but I feel like I'm one of the few that not only like Crash, but think it's pretty good. Yeah it seems heavy handed with its message and it might have been Oscar-baity, but the acting seemed really solid. And the cinematography was pretty good as well as the directing. I mean all in all I think it's a decent movie at worst.

I just fail to understand why most people will say it's absolutely terrible and again, "utter shit". Could someone civilly explain to me why people think this, or if you think it then why?  I'm genuinely curious.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As someone who has seen the original I thought it was actually pretty good. It's not bad at all. Josh Brolin is great in it. It's shot well. It's definitely a good remake, but like I said, it did feel rushed. But all in all it was pretty good. However, I think if you have the opportunity to see the original, you have to watch it. Spike Lee's is good, but Chan Wook Park's is a masterpiece. But if you can't watch the original, then Spike Lee's is a good option. It stays pretty close to the original. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But the thing about voice acting is, is that you can really only covey emotions through your voice. Some of the greatest acting performances are more than just saying things with words. It's also saying things with your body. Your mannerisms. You brought up Mark Hamill's Joker vs Heath Ledger's. Yes Mark Hamill's Joker is great, and I'd say probably more iconic, but what makes Heath Ledger's Joker incredible is his mannerisms. They way he walks, moves his hands, his body language, how he licks his lips. These are things you just cannot do as a voice actor.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because I can think of a few actors/actresses that deserve to be nominated more than someone who did voice work. I understand voice work isn't easy, but it just wouldn't be fair to nominate someone who did a voice over instead of someone who actually was physically there. Physically acting with more than just their voice. Acting includes not just voice, but expression of the face and body. Some of what makes acting performances great are the subtle things they do with their face and body. 

Edit: I should clarify that I DO agree that voice actors should be recognized. What they do is incredible and not everyone can do it. What I'm saying is that *acting* acting and *voice* acting are two different things. They require different kinds of performances. Voice acting is about how you convey a character through voice while *acting* acting is about how you convey a character not only through voice, but through your mannerisms. They way you walk, move your hands, the way you look and so on. Things you simply cannot do as a voice actor.

It might be weird to segregate a Best Voice Acting category and a Best Actor category, but it makes sense. We have two separate writing categories: one for original screenplay and adapted screenplay. We have two separate Best Picture categories: one for animated and one for live action. Why can't we just have two separate acting categories? That way voice actors don't have to compete with *actor* actors. I don't think voice actors should be treated differently, but they do. Given a choice between a voice actor and an *actor* actor, the Academy will always choose the latter. Is it fair? No, but that's the way it is. If you lump voice acting in with Best Actor, they will almost always never get the award. They might not even get a nomination, but if there were a category for voice acting then they would get the notoriety they deserve every year. </TEXT>

I still think that as long as a movie is good, it's good. I don't care if it's a remake, or whatever. I'd rather see a really good movie that isn't the most original thing than an original movie that's bad. And that's just my preference. I'm not saying that all original movies are bad, in fact, some really great movies are original. But at the same time, there have been some really good movies that are remakes, sequels, prequels, reboots, adaptions or whatever. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [College English] An essay comparing the gay rights movement to the black power movement? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-11-26 01:01:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So in English we watched a documentary called [Salute](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0874317/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1). You can read the story [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Olympics_Black_Power_salute). Basically, my teacher wants us to write an argumentative essay about something from 1968, using the movie as one of our sources. I decided to compare the black power movement to the gay rights movement. So far all I have is a thesis statement, but I'm having a hard time coming up with points and how to structure my introduction paragraph.

My thesis statement also needs to be improved in terms of wording. My thesis statement says: "Racism in the 1960's was so strong, that it would have been better if it was a gay rights sign instead of a black power sign." I can't figure out how to word it though.

But I really need help coming up with arguments to support my thesis. Any help is greatly appreciated.

Tell us what is holding you up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Rock Band 3**: This is a game I never really stopped playing. I play it like every week. Man, this game is great. Definitely one of my all time favorites. So many songs. But as I was playing this past week I started thinking about if we'd ever see another Rock Band game. With the new consoles and everything they're capable of, it'd be interesting to see a next gen Rock Band game. But only if they allow us to import all the songs we've bought. I don't really know of anything they could do better in Rock Band 4 or whatever they'd call it other than graphical stuff and maybe allow us to upload our own music?

**Fallout 3**: This is a game I played when it first came out. Got to like level 5 and wasn't having any fun so I stopped. I guess it was because I had never played a game like it before so I didn't know *how* to play it. So a few years later Skyrim comes out and I try it and fall in love with it. Over a hundred hours of Skyrim later, and I decide to go back to Fallout 3. I am absolutely loving it now. I've been playing it so much this past week. I guess Skyrim was sort of a good introduction to that style of game, and because I was use to it, Fallout went from feeling so foreign to feeling so natural and fun. Now I'm looking into playing New Vegas, but yeah, Fallout 3 is so incredible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Brandon Lee's accidental death on the set of The Crow.

"In the fatal scene, which called for the revolver to be actually fired at Lee from a distance of 12-15 feet, the dummy cartridges were exchanged with blank rounds, which feature a live powder charge and primer, but no bullet, thus allowing the gun to be fired without the risk of an actual projectile. But since the bullet from the dummy round was already trapped in the barrel, this caused the .44 Magnum bullet to be fired out of the barrel with virtually the same force as if the gun had been loaded with a live round, and it struck Lee in the abdomen, mortally wounding him. He was rushed to the New Hanover Regional Medical Center in Wilmington, NC where he underwent 6 hours of surgery. However, attempts to save him were unsuccessful, and Lee was pronounced dead at 1:03pm on March 31, 1993 at the age of 28. The shooting was ruled an accident." </TEXT>

<TEXT> A weird question, but I was wondering if there were any songs that are similar to Nine Inch Nails songs from the album The Fragile. I know there are NIN songs available but none are from the Fragile. 

Like songs that are kind of epic style rock and loud? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm playing through Fallout 3 for the second time. The first time I really didn't enjoy it. I think it was because it was so different from anything I had played before that I didn't know how to play. So then I played Skyrim and loved it! So this past week I went back to Fallout 3 and I'm really loving it now.

So my question is, what's the word on Fallout 4? Has it been officially announced? Are there any details or leaks about it? The technical leaps Bethesda has made since Fallout 3 really get me excited about Fallout 4. If it's happening that is. Any info about it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is there really even a point to wearing a mask in single player free roam? I remember before the game was released they were talking about masks and made it sound like Red Dead Redemption. Like you would go into an inventory, put a mask on, cause some mayhem, then once you get out of the line of sight of the cops you could remove the mask and lose your wanted level. 

The only way to equip and remove your mask is by going in your home. So is there really even a point to having a mask in the game?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Purpose: It's mostly going to  be something to carry on a daily basis. Used for things like opening stuff, basic uses, and even, god forbid, self defense if the situation calls for it.(I live in a very rough neighborhood)

Size: I'm looking for something not too big, but still a good size. Something that fits comfortably in a pants pocket.

Knife type: Folding knife is best

Price Range: I'd like to not spend more than $100 if possible.

Type/Style: I don't go camping too often, but I'd love to have something pretty rugged that could handle the great outdoors.

Blade Type: Plain edge is preferred, but a combo of plain and serrated is okay too! 

Blade Steel: I don't know or understand enough about steel to make a good educated guess on what steel would be best. I'm not picky. I guess something that stays sharp longer, but without being too pricy.

Anything else: Nothing else really. Just need a good, durable everyday knife that will last a long time.

If you need anymore info I'd love to give it. Thanks for any and all help! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm looking for a subreddit like battlestations where people post pics of their setup, but for more home entertainment like stuff. Like console gamers or pictures of entertainment set ups. I don't game on a pc. Mostly xbox. I'm about to redesign my living room and I'm just looking for inspiration, but all I can find really on battlestations are pics of desktops.

Is there a subreddit like battlestations geared more towards console gamers or home entertainment setups? </TEXT>

I thought it was kind of genius and couldn't help but to love it. I think it's because as an adult, I realized it wasn't really meant to be taken seriously, but instead is suppose to be cheesy. I haven't had that much fun watching a movie in a long time.

Maybe it's not that big of a deal, but I was just kind of disappointed. </TEXT>

However, I prefer something visually appealing, but I'm open to any and all suggestions.

<TEXT> I heard a song recently, maybe a pop song, but it's recent. It features what sounds like either a marimba or steel drums. It's not fast paced though, but not too slow. That's really all I know about it. I don't even know the lyrics other than part of the chorus that goes something like, "She something something something." Obviously they don't say "something". The somethings represent how many words there are in the chorus. So he says, "She" then says like three more words. I know it's not much info, but I appreciate any help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I heard a song at work today and loved the beat and rhythm of it, but don't know what it is. I know it's fairly recent because we only pay recent music, but not top forty stuff. I've never heard this song anywhere else before. I know one lyric, "I'll love you until the end of time." Or something like that. It's a pop song with a sort of middle eastern beat/rhythm to it however the singer sounds American. I know that at the end of the song he says, "Until theee eeeeennnndddd ooooof tiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiime."

The song has a pretty chill sound to it. It's not a slow love song. Definitely more of a pop song.

I know this isn't a lot to go on, but it's all I got. 

Edit: New details: Most likely male singer. Also I should clarify what I mean by recent. What I mean by recent is like this year.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Shots that say so much without saying almost anything? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-08-03 03:48:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I watched Samsara recently and two shots struck me with how powerful and how much they said without saying anything. [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=PAeIDRzGZ1A t=3660) one of a geisha shedding a tear, showing how hard her life must be. And [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=PAeIDRzGZ1A t=4602) one of a disfigured war veteran at a memorial cemetery, showing the price for peace and the cost of war.

Are there any other great shots like these? Ones that say so much without saying hardly any dialogue? You know what I mean? Sort of like how a picture is worth a thousand words kind of thing? What are some great examples of this in film? Shots that are so powerful and say so much with so little. I hope I explained myself well. I'm not really looking for scenes per se, more so just single shots. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2013-08-02 10:08:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm trying to find movies where the opening scene is basically a quiet, typical opener, then BAM! Something in the vein of the opening scene of [Children of Men](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCTgUq6hzUk). Clive Owen just gets some coffee walks out of the shop, then BOOM! a bomb goes off then title card.

Or Reservoir Dogs. Starts with them having a comical, friendly conversation, then all of the sudden it goes to Orange in the back seat bleeding to death and screaming.

Or think Dark Knight when SPOILER!!!!!!!!! Rachel dies. Shes talking to Harvey, everything's fine, then BOOM, out of nowhere the building explodes.

Another great example isn't a movie, but rather a video posted a few days ago. Where a woman is driving for like 20 seconds then out of nowhere without warning, a car comes flying at her. 

I'm really looking for that contrast of when a scene goes from quaint and quiet to fucked in less than a second. 

I guess it doesn't have to be an opening scene, but it's preferred. The only real stipulation is that it has to be a pretty normal non action scene at first then out of nowhere something happens.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I work at American Eagle and supposedly all American Eagles play the same music, so that might help. I only know brief parts of the choruses of the two songs.

The first is a punk rock sounding song with a female vocalist (or at least they sound female). The chorus goes something like: "She said don't forget your friends, I know; Don't forget your friends, I won't; don't forget your friends." Or at least it sounds a lot like that.

The second song I have even less info on. It's a pop song sung by an extremely British guy. So much so that when he says "No" it sounds like, "Now". The chorus goes a little like: "Never gonna get, never gonna gt it, no." I know that's super vague, but at work I can't focus on the lyrics plus it's not ever loud enough.

I only hear these songs at work and I've tried looking up the American Eagle playlist, but still can't find them. I'm grateful for any and all help! Thanks!  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2013-07-11 22:05:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay, so I made a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1hwb6k/what_are_some_good_movies_to_show_to_a_group_of/) a few days ago looking for help figuring out what movie to watch on our movie night. 

After looking at the comments, and comparing them to the movies I actually own, I've put together a list of seven movies. However, I can't decide which to watch. In the original post, I talked about what my friends liked. "They don't like slow paced movies and would rather not watch a drama unless its interesting and has good pace. They like just about any genre but would prefer either a horror, comedy, action or any combination of those. I think above all though the thing that matters most is if its interesting and has good pacing. I don't want to bore them. I showed them There Will Be Blood once and I could feel the awkward boredom in the room."

The List: Pulp Fiction, Event Horizon, Fight Club, Children of Men, Dredd, Crank, and Se7en.

So which of these would be the best crowd pleaser? The one everyone would be most likely to enjoy? Which is the easiest to get into, no matter what kinds of movies you like? </TEXT>

I watched this not knowing what to expect and was immediately drawn in by its animation style. Tells a very interesting story about a selfish morally corrupted man who one day wakes up with wings on his back. I was really amazed by not only the animation but also how it tells this story with no dialogue. It even gets a little Cronenberg-y at some parts. Definitely give it a watch.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lets fantasize for a minute here. Lets say that there is no way it will be bad. That they will get everything right and it will do justice to the original show. That it will without a doubt be great. 

And I'm not talking about a remake of a show. I'm talking about a sort of continuation of the show. I'm talking about something like the Rugrats Movie, Simpsons Movie, Serenity, and Arrested Development. 

So what tv shows would you like to see get a movie? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So my friend got me into World of Tanks and while we were setting it up we started talking about the voice chat in the game, or any pc game in general, and thought it be cool to have some sort of voice modulator software, where whenever we talk, people hear like a delocated, super low voice. For example, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=YlxxxXz4T-s#t=16s)

So my question is, is there any software that can do this?

Again, if this isn't the right place, please tell me where I can ask this, thanks, guys! </TEXT>

My friend is moving away this week and I wanted to give her a photo of all of us. The problem is that it was taken on an iphone so it's super fuzzy and grainy and the quality isn't that great.

Could someone improve the coloring to make it less yellow and more "natural" looking? Also is it possible to make it clearer or less grainy? Just an overall better looking picture?

I really appreciate any help. We just want our friend to have a nice picture of all of us all.

Edit: Thank you /u/screwball2 and /u/braceyourself87 these are great! I really appreciate it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I watched Kill List recently and really liked it. I liked how it starts off pretty standard but as the movie progresses, things start getting darker, stranger, and more evil.

Are there any other good movies that start off pretty standard, but throughout the course of the movie things just get darker, more evil, more insane, stranger, and just all out worse? 

Like the protagonist is totally sane at the start, but throughout the movie he experiences things that get increasingly unsettling, violent, dark, and evil and by the time the movie is over he is a different, emotionally and mentally broken man. Anything like that?

Edit: Requiem for a Dream is a good example of what I'm talking about. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm looking for some graphic novels to read that are realistic. As in, they're about real, normal people. Not super heroes. Not zombies. Not monsters. Just regular average Joes or average Janes. 

One of my favorite graphic novels is Daytripper. It's about a guy and his life from his childhood all the way to his adulthood. No superheros or supernatural stuff. Just a guy and his experiences in life.

Or some good heist graphic novels, or cop novels, detective novels, war novels, or even just novels about a person or group of people. Basically graphic novels about people who aren't superhuman. They're just like you and me.

As much as I think superheros are cool, I'm just fascinated with human drama. Human interactions. Human problems.

I hope I explained well enough. If you need more details and information about what I'm looking for, just let me know. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What do you consider a must see movie simply because of what they achieve or do on a technical level(music, camera work, sound, cgi, effects, cinematography, etc.)? Regardless of how good you think the movie actually is in terms of acting or writing or story. 

For example, Enter the Void is a movie many would consider bad or boring and not that great. However, I think it's a must see purely because of what they achieve with the camera work and cinematography.

Also, Avatar. Many like it, but there are also many who don't think it's that great and has a bland story and average acting, but I also consider it a must see because of its groundbreaking effects.

So what movies do you think are must sees from a technical standpoint? </TEXT>

The scene I saw involved a man and a little girl. There was also a cyborg like woman attacking them. This was in like the near future I believe. So the cyborg woman attacks the man with some sort of hand blade thing. I think. But the man holds up his hand and the blade goes through his hand and stops right at his eye. It was also raining I believe. And this took place within a skyscraper I believe. Please identify this! It's been haunting me for years! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Didn't know where else to put this. I just want to see it get made. The creator has said that The Jungle Movie, the next and final HA! movie, was suppose to be the last movie. It would've answered all sorts of things like what happened to Arnolds parents, what happens between him and Helga amongst wrapping up  the stories of all the other kids. [Here's an interesting article](http://tendraheyarnold.wordpress.com/2009/03/28/confirmed-notes-about-the-jungle-movie/) where Craig Bartlett, the creator, talks about the unmade movie and what would've been in it. 

It saddens me that this might never be made. I just need closure! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Evil Dead remake over hyped? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-04-08 08:03:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First off I wanna say that I don't hate this movie. In fact, I really liked it a lot. However, it didn't meet my expectations. I think it might have been too over hyped.

Before it came out I saw some reviews that said this movie was incredible and it was the bloodiest movie ever made. Now while it WAS bloody, I felt only one scene was super bloody. I was expecting every death to be crazy amounts of blood everywhere. Also, the trailers were absolutely incredible and did and amazing job of hyping me up. And finally the poster. The poster said "The most terrifying movie you will ever experience." That tagline made me believe I was about to see a remarkable piece of horror.

And the movie wasn't really that scary, it was more just violent. I was expecting to not be able to look at any of the deaths, but it was actually pretty easy to watch. I felt more grossed out watching the original Evil Dead. Now, again, I still really liked and enjoyed this movie, but did the marketing over hype this movie? Or was this all my fault because I set my expectations so high?  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2013-03-18 13:33:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay so I watched 500 Days of Summer and it kind of reminded me of Blue Valentine in that it was sort of a story about the rise and fall of a relationship told in a nonlinear fashion. I want to see some more movies like this.

So, are there any good movies about the rise and fall of a relationship? Movies where you see the beginning and end of a relationship? It can be about the relationship between husband and wife, girlfriend and boyfriend, between friends, parent and child, etc., any relationship told in either nonlinear or linear fashion. It just really fascinates me to see how a relationship progresses from two people getting to know one another, to loving each other, then to see it start to crumble and eventually fall. Blue Valentine is one of my favorite movies, but it's also one of the saddest I've ever seen. Thanks! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay so I've only played like three quarters of Mass Effect 1 and stopped because my game was messing up so I never went back. Recently I've been wanting to play a Mass Effect game. The only thing stopping me is the fact that I'm like two and a half games behind and don't have that kind of time to play both Mass Effect 2 and 3 on top of finishing the first one.

I listen to a couple of gaming podcasts so I kind of know what happens in all of the Mass Effect games and kind of know what's going on. So I want to get Mass Effect 3. My question is: Is it a good idea to jump in the third one without finishing the first and not playing the second? Will I know what's going on or get lost? Also, should I get ME3 or ME2? I've heard from almost everyone that ME2 is better, but I'll only have time to play one of them so I figured I'd get ME3 because it's the last one. Basically, which one will give me the better experience(better mechanics, story, fun, stuff to do, etc.)? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've applied at nearly 100 places within the last 4 months. I've been unemployed for about 8 months. I'm about to go to college and need a job, but haven't been able to get one for 8 months despite the fact I apply to multiple places a week. I mean, I don't even get a call. I never hear from the job, so I have no closure about if they even saw my application or not. 

This upsets me because I've been searching for 8 months, however I have friends and family members that got jobs after looking for only a couple of weeks. And we have the same amount of qualifications. What gives? How come the people who actually need and want a job and have been looking forever seem to stay unemployed? And the people who don't need a job, but want one just so they'll have money to buy material objects they don't need seem to get jobs easy? This blows. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I saw the Fast and Furious 6 trailer during the super bowl and it got me thinking. I remember the first Fast and Furious way back when it was just a small crime movie about an undercover cop in the street racing world of a California city. Now it's evolved into international heist/race action thriller taking place in world locations with huge action. Not that I'm complaining, I just find it interesting how this franchise started as one thing and has changed into something else entirely different. 

So, what other movie franchises or tv shows have started as one thing and turned into something else entirely? For better or worse? 

**EDIT:** I'm no talking about what franchises stated off good and ended up bad. I'm basically saying what franchises or shows have basically changed genres. Example: The Fast and Furious used to be a small crime movie and is now an over the top international action movie.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why is The Impossible not getting love from anything? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-01-28 23:41:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I saw the Impossible and it's one of the best movies not only of the year, but in a while. It has incredible effects, acting, and directing. So why is it basically non existent at all these award shows and top ten lists? How come this fantastic film is getting no nominations at practically any award shows and getting hardly any recognition from critics and columnists? I've seen tons of websites and magazines talk about what they think are the best films, but no one mentions the Impossible. What gives? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I saw Zero Dark Thirty on Friday and I was thinking this is such an American movie. But, is it the most American movie? Probably not, but what do you guys think is the most American movie ever made? 

Also, if you had to pick a movie to represent America and what America is, what would it be? Like what movie embodies best what America is? Like, if you gave an American film to a foreign person in order to show them what America is really like and what we're all about, what film would that be? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Guys, we've already seen posts about what were the best movies of 2012 and the best cinematography and best performances of 2012. But what do you guys think are the best scores of 2012? Or best soundtracks or best original songs of 2012? I really loved the scores for Samsara and Dredd because they really captured the mood and feeling of those films. But what do you guys think are the best? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey I'm looking for a show. It was a Japanese game show that came on G4 and I loved it. It was a show that had a ton of extremely difficult obstacle courses. One of them was had people unicycling along super thin platforms and hopping upstairs. That's the only obstacle course I can remember right now. Please help! </TEXT>

<TITLE> What game has good tactical multiplayer/co-op? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-01-12 05:12:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys. Recently I've had an urge to play a game with good tactical multiplayer. Something along the lines of Spec Ops from Call of Duty(best example I could think of). I want something they relies heavily on tactics, communication, and teamwork in order to win/complete objectives. It can be co-op, online or offline, doesn't matter. Or even player vs player/team vs team. I don't really care what genre it is either so long as it's good tactical multiplayer/co-op. Thanks, guys!

Edit: Preferably console games. I don't have a decent pc. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Looking for a game with a different kind of customization. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-12-27 21:02:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys and gals. I was playing spec ops: the line and noticed in the settings that you could change the filter on the game to change the look of it. This reminded me of red dead redemption. In RDR, you could change the brightness and contrast and make it as vibrant and colorful as you want, or as desaturated as you want. You could even make it black and white if you so desired. I thought this was an awesome feature as it allowed you to tailor your game to the look and feel that YOU wanted. So my question is are there any other games for consoles that allow you to change/adjust the color/contrast/look of the game?  </TEXT>

My budget is preferably no more than $150 and the most I'll absolutely go is $200. Also, how reliable is ebay for buying lenses? Thanks for all the help! </TEXT>

<TITLE> I want a movie that will make me cry </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-11-20 10:20:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was wondering if you guys can suggest a movie that will make me cry. I'm a guy and I've seen a lot of movies, but none have made me cry. I hear people all the time talking about a movie they saw that made them cry, and I want to experience that. I want to see a movie that affects me so much on a personal/mental/emotional level that it makes me cry. I don't really know why I want to experience this other than the fact that I haven't ever experienced it. There are a few movies though that have brought me close to tears such as Requiem for a Dream and Lion King. I would say it takes a lot to make me cry. I mean I cried when my golden retriever died and I cried when my grandparents died, but that's basically it. A friends son past away recently and I didn't even cry (I don't mean that in a proud way). I mean sure I was sad, but I didn't cry. So I think it has to affect me on a personal level. So can you guys suggest a movie so incredibly sad and depressing that if it doesn't make me cry then there's something wrong with me? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I'm having family photos done tomorrow at around noon. It's going to be outdoors. I live in Tennessee. What should I wear? I'm going to go shopping today. I'm looking for some jeans and a shirt and possibly a jacket. So, generally speaking, what colors/patterns should I get? What kind of jeans/shirt should I get? If I got a jacket of some sort, what kind should I get? It's a pretty casual shoot. I really want to look nice because these will be the last photos of us for a good while. Thanks guys! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Who I think should play Nathan Drake in the Uncharted movie </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-11-04 12:14:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I want to start off by saying I'm sorry if this isn't a good place to post this, but it seems like it belongs here. Also, I'd like to say that yes, Nathan Fillion would be the perfect Nathan Drake, but I think we can agree that it won't happen unfortunately. Now, the person I think should play Nathan Drake is Bradley Cooper. Hear me out. The guy is a pretty solid actor. He can be funny and he can be serious. He also has the physique to be able to handle a role like this. The guy's got star power! This is just my opinion, but what do you guys think? Every time this topic comes up, Brad Cooper's name isn't even mentioned.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> How I think Looper should have ended-SPOILER </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-09-29 00:34:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay so you know how at the end when Joe sees Sara get shot and the screen's all gold, and Joe says he saw everything, a mother die for her son, a man kill for his wife yadda yadda yadda. Then he says something about how the loop is closed or something like that. I think it should have ended there implying that he caused Cid to be the man he grows up to be, and the events in the movie will repeat itself forever, therefore creating an endless "loop". I think that's how it should have ended. I think it would have created a bigger impression and been a better ending. But this is all just my opinion. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I don't know if this post belongs here, but why all the hate towards Apple? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-09-28 11:19:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I don't know if this goes here, but here I go. I want to know why so many pc users relentlessly hate on Apple products. I'm not trying to start a flame war or anything. I want to have a serious discussion about this because I am genuinely curious. Like when my friend (who hates Apple and loves pc and Android) comes over and I say my iphone or macbook is acting up, he says it's "because Apple made it." I've asked him what his problem with Apple is before and he has never given me an answer other than "because Apple sucks." In fact, most of my pc friends react this way. So in an attempt to get valid reasons why people who use pc and Android tend to hate Apple, I've come to you guys for answers. Again, I'm not trying to start a flame war. I just want some insight on this issue.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I saw a movie either in the late 90s or early 00s where a guy transformed into a woman (I think only at night?). I think when he was a woman he had black hair, but I'm not sure. I remember one scene where he was a woman and some guy (with glasses?) was trying to sleep with him/her. Again I'm not 100% certain on some of these details. </TEXT>

<TITLE> How badly do people want a Justice League movie? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-08-14 17:14:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I ask this because in order to make one, they will have to reboot Batman again. Plus they will have to reboot Superman again because this new Man of Steel (based on the trailer) will be like Batman and won't allow a way for other DC heroes to exist in its world. In my opinion, I would rather have a great Batman series, Superman series, Wonder Woman, Flash, Green Lantern, etc. if it meant that there wouldn't be a Justice League movie rather than have crappy movies of these super heroes just so a JL movie can happen. So how badly do you guys want a JL movie? Bad enough to have crappy super hero movies just to have your JL movie? Or would you rather continue having great super hero movies if it meant there would be no JL movie?  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi, I'm new to Reddit and relatively new to photography. I have a Canon EOS Rebel T3i and would like to start taking pictures of things like insects, plants, eyes, and other small things. What kind of lens should I get? What should I look for? Like I said, I'm relatively new to photography so I don't know a lot of the terminology, so could you please answer as if you were talking to an amateur. Also, if you could maybe suggest some lenses, that would be helpful, too. Thanks you guys for any help you can give!
Also, any tips for macro photography would be nice! Not necessary, just nice! </TEXT>
