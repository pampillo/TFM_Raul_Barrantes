<TEXT> More transition effects in the app drawer or homescreen switches.  
More app based integration like aviate.  
my color screen like themes.  
^ all of this added/removed by the users wishes(so he/she can keep it light or as feature rich as possible).  

Im not Saying Nova devs should'nt be rewards for their work. They have every right to put a price on their app after all the hard-work that goes into it.  

But the possibility of the what nova can do can be really expanded once you have a user/dev/contributor system in place.  

Also people will pay for stuff if they feel that it improves the overall experience on android.  If an opportunity arrives that they can invest on it/choose the set best set of features for the next version; many will definitely contribute to the development.

<TEXT> i've personally noticed that lot of people want to customize but don't really do anything because they look up their favorite launcher has a limited custom set of awesome features; and also for lots of android user - the cost is a big hindrance($ - local currency conversion)  

So most of them settle for the UI that comes with the phone or install a free version of the launcher with limited set of feature.  

When you have an open environment, users/devs could write an unlimited amount tiny plugins that people can download for features they'd like to have in a launcher.   
The app can also accept donations from users so that good development happens.  

I really like Nova and i hope they continue to be the game changer! :)

Don't give up on the b2gdroid platform.  
it has a HUGE HUGE potential im totally unaware of but i know it exists.  
Yes, its not bug-free but please continue to develop and erase all the issues.   
I was instally in awe of the UI on b2gdroid; and its very very good on usability and friendliness.   
Keep developing!  

Once its ready launch it on the playstore as an homescreen alternative and take-off from there!  

One Major issue- battery drain. Please fix that. And if rolling nightly releases are available things will be much better for tester's.   </TEXT>

Check on these lines in about:config to be set to "true":   
media.mediasource.enabled  
media.mediasource.format-reader.mp4  
media.mediasource.mp4.enabled  
media.format-reader.mp4  
media.fragmented-mp4.enabled  
media.fragmented-mp4.exposed  

Some of the option listed above might not be there in your Firefox so its okay to skip them.  
And a suggestion let webM be disabled. You'll run into a lot of choppy performance issues on YouTube and ruin the experience.  
Also dont think ignore_codecs is necessary. Try without it as well.  

If h264 is still being unrecognized its mostly the codec not being present on the system.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> i have a dell too. And yes Lenovo is the best! :D  

Thing is you need to have both cards to be enabled to use bumblebee. Your manufacturer has allowed a bios option to use specifically one; which is good in a way since you can choose what your want, but you'll have to reboot and set it again if you want to use the other.  

What bumblebee does is, it auto-manages both the cards on the fly; most of the time intel will be active(as it does all normal stuff fine, and is light on battery) while the Nvidia card is used for heavy graphics apps(Heavy on battery and heating).  

You can specifically have bumblebee run on the heavy Nvidia card by using the optirun command for an app (eg. optirun firefox).  
Also having primus installed gives a slight improved performance over the default optirun.    

I feel its a win-win situation and the user is well in control. :)     </TEXT>

<TEXT> yes it will work! :)  

First have a clean install done.  
Next follow the instruction on that page; by installing all the dependencies etc. and the proceed to install bumblebee, bbswitch, bumblebee-nvidia (driver).  
After that reboot the system, login and wait for sometime; it'll compile and load in the background(you can notice this when your fan starts to slow down and system begins to cool).  
If things are working great and you use heavy graphic intensive apps install primus which is listed on the same page  

I can root for bumblebee. I've used it for a long time and its working great a long long time! :)  

I can help you out if you need.

If that's the case you'll need bumblebee.  

Follow this guide for bumblebee, use the proprietary driver for better performance.

If it's a normal nvidia card, a package from rpm fusion will certainly do the job.    </TEXT>

I'm not sure where you can download it but perhaps Google will help you out.   
It works great for me on Fedora. Also you might need to create a tiny file to enable sub-pixel rendering(patent blocks to ship by default)  

Edit - i tried a bit of looking around. could find any right links(some key words like libfreetype). Maybe it has a different package name for ubuntu based distros. Perhaps you'll have to stick with infinality(which is really good and more customizable).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> ah not the right way.   

Use the live USB and i think you can format via the installer there.   
There should be an option hidden during the partition selection thing.  
If there's nothing there then in the desktop version of Live USB(not installer) use the disk utility to format.  
You might have to umount the harddisk for it to happen.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> alright, since i think we are diving head-first into re-installation.   

Suggest you to format the disk first to erase everything(Back up using live boot USB if you have anything important on the HD)    
Then let the auto partitioner take care of the job to split up the disk or you can do that your-self if you have the experience.   

Wait until system installs and buzz back here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Are you still using a usb stick to boot?
If so stop that and boot via the bootloader menu.  
And continue to undo any changes you've made   

Uninstall command:  
sudo dnf autoremove Packagename


The easier way is to definitely reinstall, but you'll have to reinstall all your apps again.  
If you have a speedy connection then that's good


REINSTALL:  
You should get everything back after a clean format and reinstall.  
Remember to make sure of the partition things in windows if this is a dual boot, since there is a strong chance of losing the bootloader.    

Once you completely reinstalled then buzz back here.  
I'lll guide you through installing the driver.  
Same optimus stuff on my laptop. </TEXT>

Bottom right red is okay, webM needs development.  
The other parameters it's okay if you don't have em, I was reporting from a nightly version so it might not have landed.   
Check for codecs is a nice idea, maybe the team should be notified about it, but I'm not sure how it is going to be.

<TEXT> True we don't lack talent.  
The problem is freshers aren't being recruited or are not giving any form of training after getting out of an engineering college.   
Without that skill the talent is wasted and you have a massive unemployment.  
Big firms want people with experience and where do you get experience from the new talent pool or without any training?  
Small firms also want people with experience because they need a solid direction and skills to survive.   
Hope things get better.    </TEXT>

[Elemetary OS](http://elementary.io/) has done a major major job on polishing Linux for the mainstream - they still need work on the marketing though  
KDE 5 is still with the Shiny shiny graphics(I love it) but i've moved onto GNOME3(which is more flat in look and switching between apps fast is just out-of-the-world)  
There are still polishing touches required in GNOME3 but i can live and work with it without any problems.

I still stick with [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) because it suits be well and has everything latest.  
Ubuntu and Debain are pretty good in terms of usability and stability(Debian is KING)   </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me it all 'just works' works now.   
My initial install only involves partitioning and hitting next-next-next on the installer screen.  
Its really a breeze these days.  
Graphic card is the only addition work I do.(windows also requires nvidia drivers)   
Since nvidia is going for optimus(Hybrid cards) i use the bumblebee package; for other nvidia cards a package from RPM fusion is all it needs.  
Fedora 22 pretty much identified everything on its own wifi, camera etc. Hell even my wacom tablet works - plug and play style.  

The other fine tuning i do which isn't system level stuff is install vlc, freetype-freeworld(for MacOS like font rendering) and apps like MyPaint, Krita, GIMP and Inkscape for drawing and Blender for 3D.   
Have VirtualBox also incase i need a Win environment within Linux for testing and Wine for some stupid windows only apps(which i rarely use these days)  

Have another system with Ubuntu and it works great as well :)   </TEXT>

Probably court i guess. Things like this might have a legal background.   

I understand your frustration. No one with good tech knowledge wanted DRM on the web, but there was no viable alternative at that time too, even now.   
Plus one for-good; do-good organization standing up against behemoths of the industry can't win the fight, its quite obvious.  

Problem is normal people don't care about ethics and whats good for all as long as it work. They are willing to sacrifice privacy, good-will etc. as long as "it works"  

And yea Mozilla still maintain its anti-DRM stance with a non CDM verison of firefox. So up to you as a user to suit your needs.  
They dont force you and you still have a choice.

If it's fine, then you'll have to report the issue to the add-on developer.   
Also the translucent layout maybe because YouTube is rolling out the new layout or you have activated the TestTube feature.   
An alternative addon might be the YouTube Center addon DEV edition.

<TEXT> Yes I agree to what you've said.  
People can hopefully afford the cost bump also.   

But bumping up ram to accommodate apps is not the right approach to this problem.   
Min requirements for Android or a Linux based desktop environment is 512Mb and I think it should stay as such.   
Optimization should be carried on the apps that consume a lot of memory.   
More stringent testing and restrictions should be made to ensure apps run on the minimum requirements before being released into the public.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think i wasn't clear.  
I'll take the example of moto g here, its perfectly engineered.  
Solid build, great plastics, and amazing design. It fits in your palm without any effort and stays there perfect.   
Software and battery life is highly optimized because they choose the best components on the market and assemble them.  
No heating issue's because again great engineering.  
ROM is highly optimized. Goes on for weeks without restarting.  
Great call quality(i only find this in moto) and network range. - Decades of experience.  

I don't care much from which place a phone is manufactured be it india china etc. I want good quality for the price i pay.  

I had the Micromax canvas 2 a110 before, that thing had a massive battery drain, lack of OS updates, build quality was okay when compared to the moto g, touch screen ghost touches when connected to a charger. Also had a visit to the service center to get the touch fixed and had a wonderful(/s) time there.    
These problems don't get addressed really well when you rebrand a phone, because you had no say in the manufacturing. You just put a stock rom with bloatware and ship for a good price.  

So in-short rebranding is okay, but as a company you will never grow.  
And atleast if you are rebranding optimize, optimize and optimize the Software.  
Thats the least you could do if you sell a rebranded phone.  

EDIT - the cam in the canvas 2 was good though! :)   </TEXT>

If you're still having problems its better to start off with a fresh new profile.  

Since you said webM is enabled on the youtube.com/html5 page, i thought it would be better to have a refresh/new profile created.  
WebM is still under development and as such you'll run into issues with video playback.

Good ones are far better than the bad. 
There's absolutely nothing wrong in advertising unless you profit from unethical/unlawful use of user data.

Go into safe mode in Firefox and see if it's fine. If it's fine then Check troublesome addons.  

Create a new profile. Remember to back up old Firefox data if you need them. 

Use pipelight for flash on Linux. Yes this causes the browser to get stuck for a second or two as it loads pipelight but you'll have a much better flash experience.   
It uses the latest flash version available on windows instead of the outdated Linux version of flash  </TEXT>

Avoid the dark-theme mode in Fedora for some time.  Firefox is still improving on the gtk3 support. The light themes work fine! :)  

Free advice- try getting used to gnome without changing it at first. You'll love it. Incase you don't go for the Gnome extensions to suit your needs.  

And remember to improve the fonts with Freetype-freeworld package or Infinality.(Check prev. post's on /r/Fedora for more info)   </TEXT>

<TEXT>  You seem to be more worried about price than freedom.

I'm worried on both instance.  

Kids today are hardly aware/taught that there are alternatives to proprietary software.  
A notion that choice exists isn't being propagated.  
Many are falling for marketing schemes. Its not just Microsoft.  
eg. Look at Chrome and the way the marketed themselves on the road towards domination.  
More people using an Android tied to Google than an untied version like CyanogenMod.  
Win-Intel systems in schools when kids should also be exposed to Linux, Mac's, Raspberry Pi's and Aurdino's.   

The illusion that it works makes it the best. Back in the old days you had to do some work to get things to work. Today not a bit. And its quite a knowledge black-hole when you don't know how things work in the background or the steps involved in making them work.   

Also the beauty of free software, that you can view code, contribute to the project(Artwork/code etc.) and use it as well, makes it a much better source of practical programming and a robust source to gain knowledge.  

On note of price - yes worried there too.  

* A RaspPi's is much more affordable and does pretty well for general computing purpose.   
* Open Hardware is the future as well.   
* Free(cost) software means people can use apps/software without being hindered by money. Not all of us can afford the license cost to install a legal Windows copy, a cost to install MS Office, a cost to install Photoshop etc. on top of the cost required to buy the hardware.   

Good things come at a good prices, some are worth the money! But if i end to empty my bank to type an essay in a word processor, then things become unfair.

<TEXT> Affordability. Usability. Need.  

* I dont find the point in getting the high-end when a better high-end comes out the following year.  
* If a mid-range can work and do all that i need then why bother with a high end?  
* Plus all the high-ends have a huge price tag that makes it over-rated and inflated value.  
* Probably the only good thing on a higher end device to me would be the camera, but if you can spend so much on one why not get a DSLR?   
* Updates are still slow unless you are on a nexus.   

Doesn't justify the cost for me personally.  

Spending so much and getting outdated with a newer product in a years usage feels like a waste.   </TEXT>

Edit: 
Tried it out and i love it! It works fine as well as the gtk2 version for me.  
Looks pretty neat on Non-Dark GTK themes.   
Few Issues:  
 
* There are few readability issues on the Dark Theme versions(Numix; Adwaita) on GNOME like the drop down boxes on booking.com and initial loading of google.com shows the search bar as black before turning white.   

* I wish we could get rid of the BIG FAT title bar, but HTitle add-on is quite the savior. 

* And in "Get Add-ons" there is a big white space at the bottom

* Amazon tab keep stopping and showing the spinner every second before it completely loads.  

* Scroll bars disappears on booking.com drop down boxes while scrolling from bottom to top - Date; Month.  

Typed the edit on gtk 3 :D

Wind tunnels have streamlined flows and is limited by the model size and wind-speed generation.  
when you have a car testing out on a track you'll get more accurate flow patterns(especially turbulent nature), i hope they record the footage because that's the way you can infer the data you gain.

The Font scene is patent ridden. We would have had better than Apple level font rendering on Linux and elsewhere but sadly some patents still [remain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpixel_rendering) and hinder progress.  

But as always workarounds are possible on Linux with:

<TEXT>  Is there no other environmental agency other than greenpeace?

Yes there are! And it would be better if we have them than not.  
Personally haven't seen anyone else take the fight ,on different issues, to the corporate giants and the Govt itself.  

 The only deep pockets I saw were of greenpeace. Chipko andolan worked without foreign support. Dont try to show greenpeace as warriors.

Yes i agree, income should be audited and things like this should be transparent; but same should be made mandatory for Political parties, Govt. Income   Expenditure along with finance listing for top organizations in the country.   
This is where its one-sided.   

 They are just a front for vested interest

Legally(Court) they haven't been accused for any mistake so far.  

 The ones which would like to keep any country energy dependent. If even govt promotes solar, they will start opposing production of solar panels.

I disagree. Every country is energy dependent be it US, Japan etc. They import resources to make Energy(Oil, Uranium, Coal).   

Yes i do agree to the fact that protest against the Nuclear Plant in the south was harsh, i personally support nuclear power, but you can't avoid a Disaster like Fukushima can You?   
Radioactive contamination has reached the shores of Canada today.  
Chernobyll is still a ghost town, the negative of Nuclear Power is still very dangerous.  
The Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant is in a region of Seismic activity, and i hope it works in perfect condition to benefit us all.  

If even govt promotes solar, they will start opposing production of solar panels.

LOL. Solar power is greener and I don't think anyone will oppose it. But yes it has negative effects too  
solar heats the region in which the plant is situated to extremely hot temperatures. Its [frying birds](http://news.discovery.com/tech/alternative-power-sources/worlds-largest-solar-power-plant-scorching-birds-140219.htm) these days. Best way is to locate it in non migratory paths of flying creatures.  </TEXT>

Transparency should be at every level from party incomes to MNC giants as well.  
I agree Greenpeace has sometimes been aggressive with Environmental Issues, but its not like they killed some big project for the worse.   
This seems a one-sided battle to crush your opposition because you can't be better.  
Deep pockets try an score a win every where.  
And honestly we need a Greenpeace or something of its kind. None of us citizens are so morally bothered to protect our environment or the way its misused by corporate giants in the name of "development"   </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Donations should always come from people who can afford the one dollar and that dollar won't impact their lives in any way.

Yes! I do wish people who could afford pay for it though.  
  
Also i believe if a game is launched and it has great reviews, people wont be put-off for doing a one-time payment/donation.  
I recently bought Limbo because they slashed prices.  
What becomes irritating is in-app purchases to unlock some special feature, it does help you but it has a bad impact on the mindset of a user and keeps them from coming back.

<TEXT> The problem with donation is the currency conversion.  
Dollars might be good for the west and the people living there, but for us on the East say,   
India  1$=63.58 Rs  
Japan 1$=119.78 yen  
Philippines 1$=44.58 peso  

It is quite a considerable amount. In india you'd get 12-13 packs of 5Rs biscuits or 4 Packets of bread(15 Rs.)   
Most of the people here in possession of a smart phone are teens and early adults who depend on their parents to provide them with funds, so they tend to avoid buy/donating apps which cost.   
Probably once they start earning this trend could change  

I do buy games and donate if im in financial capacity though :)   </TEXT>

If nothing fixes its probably because of low RAM. Yes throwing away the external antivirus/firewall softwares could help in getting more free ram for the browser.  
Another thing you could do it browse with some tab limit - like 4-6 tabs   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Technology wise - yes, i believe it will atleast by the next few version Firefox will come on par with things already implemented by chrome and go beyond as well.   

We need Mozilla and Firefox to exist for an open web, even if Usage etc. go down, because i don't think anybody preaches/pushes forward an Open Web like Mozilla. We had 'works on IE' before, that got addressed well and now we could see that situation rise again.  

Only when people/users make switches can the trend change for the better.  

Usage   Adoption - this depends entirely on a persons perspective. If a person feels chrome is the best thing on the planet, then you cant change him/her. Other who have a different ideology, say they value privacy or OpenSource/Standards developed software a lot, then Firefox becomes the best choice for that person.  
It really comes to a personal choice and if you're willing to make a change.  

EDIT  
Non-tech savvy people - they would be least bothered. They just want something that works.  
Only way to change them is to educate them or market better(which Chrome is all about).  
This is one crowd that has to be considered because for them defaults/ad's and marketing make it the best product.   </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Im getting this quite a lot on Nightly version 40.0a1 (2015-04-29) on Fedora Linux 20 with e10s enabled  
"a web page is causing Nightly to run slowly. What would you like to do"  
This happens randomly after some continous time of browsing, and every tab I have opened goes white with that spinner loading icon - spinning.  
Clicking the 'x' stop button on awesome/address bar does not stop the page loading.  
Refreshing other tabs also has no effect.  
Firefox keeps showing the loading spinner in content display area.  
Killing the Web process, works but this problem comes back rather quickly  
Any solution? I've only been using facebook, reddit, bugzilla, Imgur, whatsapp web.  
Also many a time, switching inbetween tabs causes the white page and loading spinner to re-appear(This happens often).  
Tried the normal trouble-shoots i.e. new profile, refresh browser etc.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> * Chrome and Firefox security i feel is almost at par with each other.  They both get owned at Pwn2Own and every other contest, so its just evolution. Multiprocess(Electrolysis) is coming to Firefox soon.    
* Chrome is quite ahead on HTML5 support true, but Google has a lot of "only works on chrome" going that will hurt the open web for the future. Google being in a more dominant position also tries to make switch which is in their favor at times (eg. recent HTML5 switch on YouTube - Media Source Extensions )  
* UI customization. Hands down. Nobody comes close to Firefox.
* I think Firefox also wins here with the support of Firefox Sync, and it is cross-platform(iOS version coming soon). But each to his own.  
* Privacy - Cant stress this enough to matter because people just DON'T want to value it; Went you get Chrome from Google, there is and always will be some form of Privacy trade off.   
Firefox is for pro-privacy and supports DO NOT TRACK tech. Chrome is just a blind NO to this question. 
Mozilla doesn't want your data but Google will surely want it some how.    
* READER MODE! :D (i love this on android now, will come soon to Desktop)  
* Extension support - I personally feel Firefox rules this (maybe the fanboy in me)  
* Firefox on Top of the [Browser GrandPrix](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/chrome-27-firefox-21-opera-next,3534-12.html).  2013 yes - didn't find a new one :( .  
Also beat chrome out on [benchmarks](http://arewefastyet.com/) - Lower is better.  
* Personally hate the new "Works on Chrome" or "works on webkit" views. If you're a dev YOU SHOULD ensure your site works everywhere. Another reason i stick to Non-Webkit browsers.  

EDIT - Chrome is Tetsuo aka RAM hog :(  
As for "apps" on Firefox - https://marketplace.firefox.com/ </TEXT>

The only champion car on the grid is the Merc and every thing else doesn't matter, Alonso saying if they(Ferrari) are not on the top, his move was fine, seems alright to me now.

<TEXT> It certainly is possible, you just need the right color palette.   
Digital Painting isn't that bad with gimp. Once you get a hang of the brushes and brush settings your work flow will be smoother.   
Path tool can help you with sharp edges or strokes.  
Also use layers, definitely helps and saves time on mistakes.   

If you're trying to Make something of the face mash thing like the images you posted, know how to cut out images properly. Use layers, set warmth tones, use curves, blur and clone tool. 

Edit - combine multiple software like krita, mypaint and Gimp, you'll finish much faster  </TEXT>

MIME Type: video/mp4; codecs="avc 1.42001e mp4a.40.2"  
DASH: no(18)  

Just to clarify, tried this out on a fresh profile.  
I only have the top 3 box's (HTMLVideoElement, H.264, WebM VP8) enabled on the YouTube HTML5 page and the rest disabled. MSE disabled by default.  
If i do enable MSE then vp9 kick's in most of the time, but it currently has A/V sync issue's among others which let the devs to disable MSE on Linux. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah im not sure if this is gonna help you, but with bumblebee installed and running, you could use "optirun -b auto nvidia-settings -c :8" to activate nvidia-settings and create specific Application Profiles.  

Other option could be to use the Nvidia proprietary drivers(incase you're still on nouveau).  
In PowerMizer set to Max Performance.  

Also check out these guides, might help you:

<TEXT> i think your app should be able to use GPU when needed automatically.  
Maybe if your look around you could set some parameter/command to permanently run the app with a GPU. Or the Nvidia Settings Manager could be of help.  
As far as i know the battery drains as fast as the usage. When your hooked to the power port, it just lets current pass through, nothing more i feel.   </TEXT>

Me currently using bumblebee and its your best shot for proper power management. I think its better than the nvidia-prime thing.

After a while i started reading about all the amazing headfake techniques chrome uses(like faster animations) to make people believe its faster. Once android came, i knew Chrome would rise to a peak and so much control to a corporate wasn't good i felt.  
And NSA happened too.  

Stuck with Firefox all these years(From version 1.3 or 1.5) and i still love this browser! I hope once they launch the iOS version soon, Mozilla will get a better hold of the mobile market, and also if they launch on Windows Phone it will be a win too. </TEXT>

Switched to the Moto G 2ng Gen. (2014).  
Its well designed, has the same screen size of 5 inches like the Canvas 2 but the curved back, the thinner screen edge bezels, super comfortable to hold and with a feel-good material Motorola has won me over completely.

<TEXT>  The problem is with the open source community is that they too content with what they have, they don't see lack of good GUI tools on Linux a problem because they use the command line anyway

Dont feel that way, we wanted Office, we've got LibreOffice and OpenOffice.  We wanted a alternative to 3ds max/Maya(though maya runs on Linux) we got blender and its going places. Alternative to Autodesk Sketchbook, we've got Krita and MyPaint. Corel Draw/Illustrator - Inkscape, SynFig.  
There is an abundance of good software, i'll admit some of these having a learning curve but they are worth the time spent!   
The community has never kept quiet, we've kept demanding, its just the commercial bigshots are ignorant, and the community had to figure out its own version of things.

<TEXT>  Contests for UI and UX do not work (that is what "everyone feels qualified to criticize the UI and suggest improvements" would be). 

i think if mock-ups are shown to the public or demo-ed, then people can vote on the best implementation.  
Also people who have a better concept should be given consideration and voted along with the other concepts.  
GIMP has quite a long release cycle, so this should be possible.

GIMP ui currently is way better than what Blender was in the initial days. But blender has picked up, polished it self and has a much better UI today but the most important thing is that it's still Blender.  
There is a learning curve to both these software's, but something about UI/UX is important to have a really smooth work flow.

The UI could use a fix, many other features can be smoothened out, yes Photoshop and Gimp are different, that should remain, but there are things like cmyk etc. that still haven't happened. A drive like this should enable users to vote on a set features they want to see implemented in time frame.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We all know that there is no Photoshop on Linux and I dont think Adobe has any plans to make one.    
GIMP is the best thing available but IMHO it hasn't reached that level of perfection we would like. Yes, it does a lot of things Adobe can do and sometime even better but theres a feel that something's missing.    
Krita another OSS app went for a successful Kickstarter funding recently(https://krita.org/item/krita-2-9-0-the-kickstarter-release/) and its helped the software and the community pretty well.  
Im sure lots of users out there would like GIMP to reach the top, many want a true Photoshop alternative thats simple to use and looks good.  
What are your thought /r/gimp ?  Wouldn't such a funding campaign help GIMP progress as the app we want? </TEXT>

<TEXT> From Wiki:  
"Microsoft has several patents in the United States on subpixel rendering technology for text rendering on RGB Stripe layouts. This had caused FreeType, the library used by most current software on the X Window System, to disable this functionality by default.[4]

Apple was able to use it in Mac OS X due to a patent cross-licensing agreement.[12]

The patents 6,219,025, 6,239,783, 6,307,566, 6,225,973, 6,243,070, 6,393,145, 6,421,054, 6,282,327, 6,624,828 were filed between 1998-10-07 and 1999-10-07, thus should expire in 2019-10-07" </TEXT>

Any of these 2 methods will drastically improve font rendering, Infinality will also mimic other OS's font rendering mechanism.  
And your browser is also responsible, for some unknown reason Chrome is sub-par at font rendering, do try out Firefox, its simply good these days.  
Also the Liberation Sans font is choppy(if on fedora[maybe other Linux's too] - reported bug but no action has been made yet)

EDIT - There are patents preventing these from enabled by default which is why its left to the users choice </TEXT>

<TEXT> yeah ive been thinking about it too, im just hoping gnome can be used fine with a 512mb ram environment. It used to run the old version of Fedora pretty well and its been a long time(4+ years) since i upgraded it.  
New fedora has a huge minimum req. and ive been wanting to get debian for a long while.  
just hoping it works out fine :)  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [New User] What should i download - the standard version or the Gnome version of the ISO? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-07 11:52:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello r/debian  
im almost on the verge to get debian for my old system as i found out it will run on hardware(512MB Core Duo) a few years back.  
But as i went to download the live installation media, i found out 2 version's - gnome and standard?  
Whats the difference between those two?  
I'm looking for a gnome desktop as natural because ive been used to it with Fedora a long time.   
Does the standard ship with the gnome desktop or do i have to get the gnome iso as such.   
Also is the installation text based or GUI?   

EDIT - SOLVED - i got the info i wanted to know! Thank you kind people of /r/debian ! :D  
If you do have more info to share, please do! :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> im wondering if you could replace the tile screenshot's on the new tab page with something like the site's logo or so? Is there any way? Because it kinda seems privacy intrusive when people can actually see image content of sites like facebook and the like, when you open a new tab.  

Also i've noticed most elements are not captured in the screen shot, its like some content has been captured and show and the rest where ignored/left out.

<TEXT>  and paste as if they were regular text which is a shame. Another option is to not use these and include a web font 

ah i dont quite understand, maybe im wrong here, but its really easy to copy-paste emoji's from http://getemoji.com/  
Just select and copy! :)

Font support is good, but colors are still an issue. Since this seems like it has SVG support, it can work quite well i guess.

Third option is actually what i felt would be good, cross platform OS based or software based support.  
Since Firefox doesn't have a way to input emojis directly into text fields, i felt this could do very well for those who want emoji inputs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> the story is underwraps so far.  
In a interview "He(lead actor) said that the movie is about modeling industry when a model enters the field not by his own wish, but on compulsion."  

According to rumours(NOT Confirmed) - "it revolves around five persons, a model (Amy Jackson) a doctor(Upen Patel) and three other people who get affected by a poisonous chemical. Reports add Chiyaan(Vikram) will sport a look which will depict a person with his face affected by such chemical."  

Its a teaser, so the plot is still off.
As for the lead actor, he's versatile and professional. An old film of his - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zRVTV1Wy8E

<TEXT> im not sure, might be a stupid guess too, but if your network card has a proprietary driver you could try install that and see if your thing works.  Check in windows or so to know your manufacturer  

Also you could try disabling IPv6 support and see if you find some luck  

Edit: Try ifup and ifdown to switch individual cards.

 lspci can list out all the detected cards etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Firefox's edge is with the add-ons it has, thats one thing millions of users love. But yes e10s is highly needed to have that edge over chrome again.  

Sometimes i feel e10s should have been a much higher priority in the past itself. FF wouldn't have lost out a good amount of users to chrome. Also risking the add-ons will be a blow to the already using FF users. I think with proper co-ordination and fast paced interaction within the Firefox community can make both e10s and add-on compatibility a great success.  

http://arewee10syet.com/ -- the working add-on list shows good promise, even though there are lots of buggy ones and non tested ones too. </TEXT>

I've been using firefox since it's version 1.0+ days.  

My best guess is that you try out to get the latest stable version. Incase you've had it installed, try a browser reset or start a fresh profile.

But i've had extremely good browsing experience on both dolphin and the stock android browser. I feel they dont disapper off because they are very lightweight in nature.

Every time i use Firefox, the GPU fan goes on and off over and over after a certain time of operation.  
My normal laptop temp is around 48-54C but when i use the browser its slowly rises above 60.  
The Processor clock jumps from 101MHz-1200MHz  
The Graphics clock jumps from 50MHz-600Mhz

<TEXT> Why does the close button have to disappear just after 8 tabs?  
Its kinda annoying. Chrome allows upto 18 tabs with the close button present.  

Im kinda sure people have more than 8 tabs opens in a normal browsing session.

<TEXT> I don't see how Shumway will allow Firefox to get users back. Most people don't exactly use Flash voluntarily. They need it because video sites require use of patented codecs (H264) and DRM.

Linux users are fed up with Adobe flash(no new versions-except security updates), and most crashes happen due to flash or some flash based content on webpages. Plus lots of people use YouTube and other video based sites a good part of usage, having something inbuilt and stable like shumway like the way Google does with Pepper, it should probably improve the reliability of the browser. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Can you please file bugs about these issues? This sounds really strange, should absolutely not happen, and we don't know of any current issues like that. Do you have some task killer or anything installed that's nuking Firefox while it runs?

Sure i shall file a bug, but i just have no content to attach to a report sadly :/
It'll just close down without any message while browsing. And i dont use any task killer.
 
 It already uses very little memory, and will work well on any Android phone with as little as 384M RAM (Firefox uses FAR FAR less, but your other apps will eat up most of that!).

i do know it does uses very less, but when other apps are also present, then things get slow, like using swiftkey, whatsapp, facebook and firefox one after the other :/

Unless someone fixes it, it'll be the same situation for people who are routed through that server or ISP.  

The bigger problem is that YouTube is not aware of this issue. Some thing similar happened to WhatApp users in india connected to a particular ISP. Only after the social media and news exploded was the service fixed.  

People need to inform YouTube about the issue! Attack Social Media! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hats off to the developer community for all the work they've done all these years. Truly, its been a great product. And i keep hoping for more good stuff from you guys! _/\_ MASSIVE RESPECT    

A little focus on more important things will probably show a positive change eventually. It will take time to fight back whats lost to chrome, but im sure a good number of them will be Firefox users who are wanting to come back to where they felt at home before.   

I guess Firefox also needs to increase its social media presence, Google can do it for Chrome through their ads system, but Firefox has to fight it out without spending much on Facebook, Twitter etc.

Once Firefox fixes up electrolysis and Shumway, that coupled with the privacy, peace of mind and the add on ecosystem, it will be a great combo to make some groundbreaking ad to get back whats lost, and add more new users.  

it will take time, but these should be worked on with a great pace now, coz time costs everything these days.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> i agree the attitude of the common man is hopeless.  

only few of us try to make a valid change. I try a lot to convince people to shift to Firefox. Some do but others just stick it to the other competition because it works out of the box and without any trouble.  

I still feel Firefox has every chance to grab back the market it lost, if it starts focusing on the current basic essentials to web browsing.  

Back to square one is the need of the hour. </TEXT>

<TEXT> i feel the browser should focus on delivering speed, lower memory usage, per Tab process and shumway.  

Honestly i don't think normal people do care if a browser is super developer friendly with all the features it provides; The general crowd wants the content or webpage to load super fast and with very little to no problems.  

I've tired Firefox Beta on Android and the Nightly versions too, but there are lots of performance issues, when compared to others in the market. Ive got lots of instances when the browser will just close without even a Crash Pop-up to send an error report.  
Plus Firefox Mobile needs to make use of less resources(RAM etc.) of low end phones, since most of them are 512 MB RAM mediatek chipsets.

Its been a really long wait from the browser that was a game changer back then :( </TEXT>

Cause chrome is able to go through. But the YouTube android app is totally failing to play and same with Firefox.  

Using google dns solves this problem :D
YouTube or your ISP(im not sure whom) has to fix this problem.

<TEXT> I've been noticing this for quite some time now, video's even though fully loaded tend to stutter a lot during playback.
It was more profound on vimeo, when the playback stop and the video  button changes from the pause button to play button. The video was fully loaded though - http://vimeo.com/48043470 - this was the video, while this thing was happening.  

Its also present on facebook videos, though to a lesser extent, and least on YouTube.  


I played the same vimeo video in another browser(chrome) and it was playing very well, even while streaming without any stutters.

<DATE> 2014-06-03 13:38:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I like Australis among the flaws that several have reported.  

One thing that totally breaks up the user experience is the sliding tab movement.  

What I've noticed it that is as long as the mouse pointer stays in the tab's area, then movement is smooth and perfect as usual; but the moment i go a bit down and over the Awesome bar or anything in vicinity, the drag movement abruptly stops.  
Honestly, its a total ruin because nobody can be so precise in maintaining the drag movement in such a small area.  

Please borrow idea from the competition and extend the drag-able area to the Awesome Bar also.  
Only then during fast browsing session can people feel the speed, mainly due to lack of disruption. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since most of the highly used buttons of a browser are tucked away and accessing them requires more click or taps, i felt a disappearing toolbar area just like the way the new Facebook app does with 'Status|Photos|Activity' bar on the bottom would be great.  

Screenshot - https://imgur.com/Efav1kc

For  once you start scrolling down, it neatly hides its self, and only reveals when your are scrolling all the way up or are already at the top of the page.  
This way you still get back all the screen space and the most used buttons are always available to the users upfront. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  If the phone has a physical menu button, no menu should be displayed, unless the app has an outdated Manifest (might be the case for Twitter for all I know).  

Yeah that's it, the tradeoff between physical/virtual menu button. i feel it'll be best left to the user if he/she wants to enable the 3 dot menu button on phones with a physical menu button. 

i feel the most important buttons such as back, forward, refresh should be in a much more easily accessible location on the screen, instead of going through a menu.  


And thank you for the mention of gestures- will get an add on right away :D

<TEXT> on large screen phones, while holding it one hand, reaching the menu key to refresh or reload the page is painfully annoying.   
People need to shift the phone position just to do a simple refresh.  
And on large screen size phone's the 3 dot menu is not provided(due to design guidelines by google), but the Twitter app has still provided it. Some sort of fix or user choice enable/disable menu/custom button should be provided near the tab count icon. </TEXT>

Yes it is has capacitive buttons on the bottom of the screen.

But the lack of a Soft-Menu button is a deal-breaker :(  
Since this is a phablet type(5-inches) device moving the finger from the screen to the bottom just to access menu button is quite frustrating. 

The FF team should have provided this option to the users to enable/disable the virtual menu button :( :(

<TEXT> Damn you've got to be kidding me.  

Linux has Bug report systems like ABRT, Bugzilla. And they do a Better job than Send Error Report(which i haven't seen fix any errors).  

I dont know if you mean Autodesk 3ds Max, Maya, CATIA  as poorly designed apps. But ive got a heck load of problems when i used to work with them. 

And as for so called "unix distros don't have any central company to supply updates"  
Maybe you should use Ubuntu or Fedora and see how wonderful they handle updates.(That includes core kernel updates without breaking the system).
Also you're able to Upgrade the entire OS to the latest version from these central repositories. 

I use windows for my gaming, i love it for that. Its the only place it shines.  For work its Linux, because its reliable and stays solid

<TITLE> What Fedora needs to do to lure in new users? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-03-19 19:04:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Since Fedora is a community based Distro, i feel it'll be great to have some feedback from them itself for the Fedora Project to be leaders again in the Free Linux OS field.

I've been using Linux dating long back to Redhat Linux 7 and onwards.
There have been amazing changes. Since ive used Linux so long, its real hard for me to go back to my Windows OS.

Here are few areas i feel Fedora Project need to pay more attention to:

1. Looks:  
We have all the icons and everything is symbolic. Its perfect. But where it lacks is that its not aesthetically pleasing. People always tend to judge a product by its finish and looks. One amazing example here is Apple - Im sure most mac buyers don't go into the details of the OS or its usage and purpose, but just give into the looks of the product. The color palette needs a refresh i feel. 
Currently its functional not pleasing (from the eyes of a normal user)

2. Tutorials:  
We need to provide the common user an OFFICIAL source of Text and Video based tutorial regarding things like installation, Music, Movies, App Installation etc. It should be clean and no Gimmicks. And the best way to host them would be TORRENTS! 

3. Default Packages:  
This is one part im a bit sad about. Previous version of Fedora came with the big guns of open source like GIMP, games etc. but most of it is removed these days. 
Normal people wont want all the other packages(they consider it junk) just like all the those preloaded android phone apps from manufacturer's.

4. Do NOT scare the new user   
New users Judge a product within 30 seconds i feel. If they feel its complex, they leave, if its too simple, they question and wonder. Just provide what is needed. FAQ are the best way to address.

5. Bug Reports  
This is daunting for a new user. They go through this unknown thing called ABRT, then Bugzilla, (GOD WHAT's Happening :O) They have been scared to death already now. We need to simplify this process. And make them understand how things work on the open source end.

6. Customization  
This was what Linux is all about.  
Fedora needs to point users to where they can find new content like themes, icons (that's what a normal user cares to find)  

7. Proprietary Package  
I know this is the No! NO! but normal user eventually need them for their Graphic Cards etc. The community should make people understand that its OK for them to install but the packages are responsibility of the company providing them. A video might help clear the air. 

8. Media, Formats etc  
Another important area where we should educate users that they can watch their favorite movies, or listen to songs in Open Source Formats, BUT, since half the world moves on mp3, avi etc, options are always available to install player like VLC etc.

9. Social Media  
Maybe the open world doesn't agree with Facebook but that's where users are and that's where users share their content. We need to make a definite presence.

10. Presentation  
Easy to understand, clean and visually beautiful. Hit them right and i guess the world will start following.

We have YouTube/Torrents to share all this Tit-bits of knowledge for free!

Do share in  your views! :)
