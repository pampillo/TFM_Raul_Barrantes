<TEXT> Basic recipe:

Slice an eggplant into ~1/2 inch rounds. 

Lay the rounds on a couple layers of paper towels, liberally salt both sides, cover with a couple more layers of paper towels, and let sit for at least an hour.

After some liquid is drained off, rinse the rounds.

Dip the rounds in beaten egg and then a combination of corn meal, shredded parmesan, garlic powder, and pepper.

Place rounds in greased pans, then into a 350 F oven for ~10 minutes, flipping once, so they get crispy.

In (ideally) a 13x9 baking pan, layer tomato sauce, eggplant, parm, and slices of mozzarella until you've used all your supplies.

Bake in 350 F oven for 25-35 minutes, until eggplant is cooked through and cheese is melty and browned.

Notes:

I used corn meal because my partner in crime has Celiac, so we try to be gluten free.

I used my Dutch oven because I don't have a 13x9 pan, but it was still wonderful.

Making your own tomato sauce would make this even better, but funds and time meant we had to use store bought. Garlic and herb would be great, but we used 4 cheese.

Next time I'd add some herbs, but it slipped my mind.

Edit: I never measure, but about half a block of each type of cheese was used, and we only used one big eggplant. It put 3 of us into food comas. </TEXT>

He moved in last August. He's in the complex across the alley from me. We've been flirting for a year. He's living there again next year.

I've left notes on his door and we've hung out a few times. He knocked on my door yesterday after I left a note and then was too scared to face him for a week. I'm freaking out because he actually wants to get drinks on Saturday, but I'm broke. And I think I'm in love with him. And I have no idea what to do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It looks like you're increasing too fast. You can't add too many increases in each round. Sadly, I think you will have to frog, but not too far.

Best way to make a flat circle (at least that I've found) is to decrease the number of increases per round by 1, if that makes sense. Like, first round, increase in each stitch, then every other, then every third, etc etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Chips were just thick cut and baked with salt and pepper.

Fish was fairly cheap tilapia coated in tapioca flour, salt, and pepper, then deep fried.

Tapioca flour works really well for fried things. We used it because my partner in crime has Celiac. We just had lemon juice and ketchup with it, because I don't like tartar sauce and she isn't a fan of malt vinegar. Next time we will definitely be trying mushy peas to be traditional, this time one of the people for whom we cooked is a pea hating heathen (but I love her). </TEXT>

If they weren't round enough, you can trim each strand to work. If they fell apart, get a friend to help make sure the knot is tight enough, and triple knot at least. If they look like a bunch of strands tied together instead of a pompom, wrap the yarn around a few more times. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Basic recipe. I know it isn't at all traditional, but I'm a poor college kid.

Ingredients:

Pork loin

Dry rub (we used salt, pepper, cayenne, garlic powder, and onion powder)

1 bottle hard cider (we used Harpoon, but anything that is a bit sweet will work)

BBQ sauce

Instructions:

Rub your meat down with your rub, let sit for at least 30 minutes.

Pre heat oven to ~190F.

Put meat in a Dutch oven. Pour cider all over and around meat.

Cook, partially covered, until the internal temp is around 150. This took us around 6 hours.

About 2.5-3 hours in, start basting the meat with the cider that's in the pan every 30 minutes.

About 90 minutes before the meat is done, take the cover off and start basting with BBQ sauce every 15-20 minutes.

Take meat out of Dutch oven, let rest for at least 30 minutes. Then, shred with two forks.

Since we used a loin, we had to simmer the shredded meat and extra fat in about half of the braising liquid and some more sauce for 45 minutes to make it moist.

Serve on buns with whatever sides you want. We had mac and cheese and corn on the cob. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I brewed random herbs into tea all growing up, since my mom is an avid gardener.

Monarda didyma, with the beautiful deep red flowers was a favorite of mine. It really worked with lavender, too. Lemongrass also makes a great infusion. Straight lavender or chamomile are also good, and exploring all the different varieties of mint is a great starting point (chocolate mint and peppermint are my favorites).

Edit: these all grow very well in Southern Indiana. I always just plucked Monarda flowers and boiled them in water for a few minutes, although I'm sure drying them would make the flavor more intense. </TEXT>

How important is water temperature? And how can you tell that your water is the right temperature (I can only tell "cold," "almost boiling," and "boiling")?

I've been dying my hair with henna for just shy of 8 years, but am looking for a color change. I know that red suits me, even though my natural color is the definition of mousy brown. I haven't ever bleached my hair, and have only dyed it unnatural colors twice (all purple about 11 years ago, navy blue tips about a year after), but wanna go crazy, since I'm graduating college next May.

I'm sorry if this isn't the best picture, but I only have my phone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My joints make it impossible to leave my apartment on a weekly basis. I did ballet for 9 years, so I'm used to sprains, dislocations, slipped disks. I'm 22 years old and have arthritis.

I slipped on the ice on my way to class Thursday morning. It didn't hurt too badly, so I didn't bother going to the Health Center on campus. Since then, it has gotten worse and worse. I serioualy think I may have re-dislocated the knee I injured last winter.

And I don't care. I've been wanting to cut again recently, so the pain from this injury is actually making me feel better. It wakes me up at night, it takes me 5 minutes to walk from my living room to my bathroom, I start crying when my cats decide to climb into my lap, but I don't want to see a doctor about it.

The guy I've been seeing thinks I have to go, even though I know that the doctor will only say things I already know (stay off it, wear your knee brace, ice and heat), but he doesn't know my history with self harm. He knows I'm depressed, and that I've been through an abusive relationship, but not that I've cut on and off for 10 years. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, for Xmas, I got a gift certificate for my LYS. I mainly got some gorgeous wool, but also got two skeins just because they were pretty, which I never do.

http://www.imgur.com/bhqzu4n.jpeg

Here they are. The peacock one is 100g (197yd), 70/30 acrylic/wool, and the other is only 50g (109yd), but 75/25 wool/silk.

I'd like to make something I can use on a regular basis, but don't know any patterns for this small of an amount. Since I've never bought yarn without a project in mind (I know, you'd think I would have after nearly 13 of crochet), I'm stumped. Plus I've had afghans on the brain for the last year or so.

So, anyone know of good patterns for small amounts of yarn? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recently got these three gorgeous scarves from my Grandmommy. They are all fairly light, and have at least some silk in them. The mint one and the pale pink (looks white in the photo) are both Liz Claiborne, and my sister got several Liz ones as well.

How would you style these? Today I'm wearing a mint sweater with the mint scarf, dark blue skinny jeans, and short heels in a similar color (it's gonna get up to 40F here, so I only need my stupid looking warm hat for a few hours).

<TEXT> I am always happy to cook for people who don't like certain foods, but personally will never say that until I have tried a food in every way possible, several times.

For me, I personally cannot stand chick peas. I've had them in stews, curries, falafels, hummus, what have you. Same thing with mayo. Alone, mixed with anything, the only time I think I've eaten it without gagging was when I had walnut shrimp in Chinatown in San Francisco this past May.

So, what else fall in this category for others? Sometimes you try hard to like something and just don't, and I think that is just fine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They can be, but if you make sure to either use entirely separate utensils (including cutting board) or wash evrrything in super super hot water a couple times in between, it should be ok.

As for a smaller shrimp dish, I'm a huge fan of shrimp and grits. Look for any recipe, although when I'm lazy I just put the two together, mix a boat load of butter into the grits and smother it all in Old Bay. I know it's not traditional, and Old Bay isn't as common outside Maryland, but I can find it here in Indiana if I look hard enough. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am planning on making a bunch of soup for a friend with Celiac's. However, all of our favorites involve flour.

I know the obvious substitutions for thickening agents (cornstarch + water, instant mashed potatoes), but what about recipes where you need to cover chunks of meat with flour before searing (beouf bourgignon and the like)? Would rice or almond flour work for things like this?

She is completely broke (not like that "broke as a joke" post, she literally has $5 for the rest of the month), so I want to help her out as much as I can. I was planning on making several types of soup in the next few days anyway, but I never cook gluten free, since I don't have a problem with it.

What suggestions do you wonderful cooks have?

EDIT: thank you all for the suggestions! I will be making quite a few soups with your help this week. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Keep supporting her. Since you said you also SH, that makes it a little easier. Suggest that she go to see a professional, but don't push it too much (I just went through something where my friends pushed too hard). Let her know that it hurts you when she hurts herself, and, if she doesn't already know, let her know that you suffer from the same thing.

Furthermore, do not EVER feel that you can help her pain by harming yourself. I know it can hurt, seeing someone you love harm themselves, but the only person who can help them is them. Do what you can, but always remember that. </TEXT>

So, I'm planning on something untraditional, since I get sick of turkey in a few days. Does this menu sound good?

Dr. Pepper glazed ham (had it last year and everyone seemed to like it)

Curried butternut squash risotto (another favorite from last year, and a decent vegetarian entree)

Roasted mixed veggies (I'm thinking turnips, beets, parsnips, and carrots)

Green beans with almonds

Brioche to go with it all (making brioche is awesome)

And pain au chocolat for dessert (making croissants is even more awesome). </TEXT>

Spicy glazed carrots are also good. I usually saute the carrots for a bit, then glaze with a brown sugar, sriracha, and water reduction.

These are both things I serve at my Friendsgiving, since I have a lot of vegetarian friends. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was one for two years in high school, and I always had the same early morning shift at the school. You get really attached to the people who come to your pool three times a week before work, and they get attached to you. They compliment you on your musical tastes, or tell you stories about "that time I saw Eric Clapton." They literally trust you with their lives, and they ask you about your swim meet that evening (a few of the guys who came in were either teachers or had children on the team). They ask how you're doing, and get excited when you tell them about your future.

It's been almost 4 years, but I still have a huge affection for "my old guys." </TEXT>

Even a large single apartment isn't good to the type of dog I'd like, and class means I couldn't take a big Rottie or Newfie or Irish Wolfhound (my favorite) on as many long walks as he'd need. Once I move into a house with a big enough yard, I will get myself a nice big dog. </TEXT>

Don't get too down because they don't express their feelings on the intricacies of your cooking. Some people can't pick them up, and some people don't even realize what the different flavor combinations are that make something taste good. I cook for my friends fairly often, and, while they say it's good, they don't say "oh, the nutmeg is what makes this curry really good," or "this is perfectly spiced." </TEXT>

But I'm terrified of quitting. My family says I seem much happier, and I feel happier because I'm drunk. All the time. I have the worst dreams when I go to bed sober. Memories of the man who emotionally abused me and images of him with my former best friend creep up unless I drink them away. I don't start crying for no reason when everything seems funny.

I don't want to stop because I don't like who I am when I'm sober. But I know that this is eventually going to kill me. Whether it be physically or due to the fact that missing so much class will kill my dreams, it will kill me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, my father has made what we call Lamb-o Bucco for years. It is my favorite dish ever.

However, my father has recently gotten sober, so having any alcohol in the house just won't happen. When he made it this past weekend, he used a mix of cider vinegar and grape juice concentrate. It was good, but nothing like how it used to be.

I don't want to trigger him by suggesting buying those tiny bottles of wine, since he would only need one, but they come in packs of four, but is there any suggestion y'all could come up with? 

TL;DR: alcoholic father in recovery, how to replace wine in recipes. </TEXT>

Sadly, I was only able to stay for 6 hours, because I found out that drinking too many energy drinks is a bad life choice (I've now been up for 18 hours and don't feel tired at all, and Red Bull puke is a thing), but at least I got two and a half hats done!

The knitters got a couple scarves done total, and several people learned new skills! The experienced crocheters/knitters will be finishing projects that were started, so the children will be getting quite a few hats and scarves.

All in all, it was a very successful event. The host was excited to start Project Linus events, even though the nearest chapter is about 45 minutes away. We learned that knit/crochet a thons will probably work better for other times, like noon to midnight, but a lot of fun was had by all. </TEXT>

This is a great event! We will be meeting to make cold weather gear for kids at the Middle Way House, the local battered women's shelter. It's tomorrow 7pm to 7am, although you don't need to stay the whole time.

If you live off campus, like me, you can still come in through the veranda till midnight. And I bet some of the awesome residents will help you if you may need to go out for a smoke once in a while (again, like me).

There will be yarn, needles, amd hooks provided, along with free snacks. If you don't know how to knit or crochet, there will be people there who can teach you (myself included on the crochet side).

TL;DR: knit-a-thon tomorrow at Collins for a great cause. You can learn a new skill and work for the greater good at the same time! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tomorrow night (7pm to 7am) a group will be meeting on campus to make cold weather gear for the children at our local battered women's shelter. A great cause, but I will be the only crochet expert there, in a slew of knitters (not that I have anything against bistitchuals).

I've come up with an easy, 2 hour children's hat pattern, but is there anything else you'd suggest? Wrist warmers come to mind, which I can also teach newbies in two seconds. 

I'd especially like something to show how big a child's wrists or neck are. I've got a chart about hats, but I hardly ever see kids, so I dont know how big to make these things. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've only recently gotten to where I enjoy cheese, so a mild one is better for people like me. Mozzarella and baby Swiss are my favorites, and I still can only enjoy them melted. So the mildness can be nice for some people.

That said, I hope that I will be able to taste bleu or brie without gagging soon. I'm on my way. </TEXT>

Personally, I won't do it, just because I remember the horror story that happened after my sister bought one with her boyfriend at the time.

In that time, her freezer died, which meant she came home to two week old beef and its smell permeating a studio apartment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok. This is kind of weird.

I hate the slew of slutty costumes, so I intend on mocking them this year. I'm pretty set on my two main ideas, but am unsure how to pull them off.

I will be spending Halloween night doing a bar crawl with some friends, including my bestie. My birthday is the 28th and hers is the 2nd, so we treat the whole thing as birthday Halloweek.

I'm torn between slutty Teddy Roosevelt and slutty Oedipus. With the former, I feel like I'd have to carry a big stick all night, which isn't conducive to bar hopping. I'm afraid that the latter may go over many people's heads.

I'm a 21 year old female (22 on the 28th), 5'8", and around 165 pounds, although I hope to continue losing weight until birthday Halloweek. I'm leaning more towards Slutty Oedipus.

Is there any way y'all could help me with either costume?

TL;DR: I'm torn between going as slutty Teddy Roosevelt and Slutty Oedipus for a bar crawl this Halloween, because I want to mock the slew of slutty costumes you see every year. Help? </TEXT>

I'll have to check out the lentil bolognese. Serious eats is always good, and I love lentils.

Edit:

I ADORE making pain au chocolat. When I make a batch of croissants, I usually do about half as pain au chocolat. And that way I cpuld make a not super sweet dessert a day or two in advance.

Pumpkin sage soup sounds really yummy, and serving it cold means I can transfer it to a bowl in the fridge, freeing up a pot for something else. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oooh, let's see if I can remember. It was pretty on the fly.

Prep your ham as normal (score in diamonds, put cloves where the scores intersect) and put it in the oven for about an hour, under foil. While that's going, throw and entire bottle of full sugar Dr. Pepper in a saucepan with sriracha, a touch of broth/water, a pinch of nutmeg, and whatever else makes it yummy. Let it reduce a bit. Take the foil off the ham and brush the glaze on the ham every 5-10 minutes till it's done.

Sorry it isn't the best recipe. I didn't follow one past what came up when I googled "how to cook a ham." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I fully apologize for the incoming wall of text. 

I know it's only early October, but the one dinner party I hosted last year was for "friendsgiving," and was the day before classes started back up after Thanksgiving break. It was so fun and I plan on doing it again this year.

I figure that people will be pretty sick of turkey by that point, so a different type of meat, plus a vegetarian option would be perfect.

Last year, I had a huge Dr. Pepper/sriracha glazed ham, curried butternut squash risotto, mashed taters, green beans with almonds, and spicy-sweet carrots, then a berry-lemon cheesecake for dessert, and home made brioche throughout.

I'd like to up my game this year. I think I'll make croissants instead of a huge brioche, but I'm unsure about everything else. The ham was amazing, and I had leftovers for a week, but I'll be inviting a bunch of the same people. I'm toying with the idea of a beef wellington, but I know about half the people don't like mushrooms, and even though you can't taste them too much in the finished dish, some people are really sensitive to the taste.

As for the vegetarian option, I'm at a loss. The risotto would have been good, but my big pot was being used for the taters, and I couldn't time things right. I'd like something I can start before the meat and sides.

Sides are confusing, too. The carrots were a hit, but I had to cook them and the green beans right before the ham was done, which meant having to scramble around while the guests were getting hungry. I don't really want to do taters this year, partially because I'm supposed to be cutting my carbs. Maybe a soup and a couple other things?

The cheesecake was bomb, but I'd like a fallback option in case my friend who makes it has to work.

Sadly, I will definitely just be getting a big box of wine to be going with dinner, but at least my friends' tastes have refined in the past year to go past white zin.

TL;DR: working on the menu for my friendsgiving this year. Need meat and veggie entrees, sides, and suggestions for dessert. Thank you all in advance! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The only thing standing between me and my annual friendsgiving is the state of my tiny kitchen. Dead week (2 weeks after Thanksgiving, hoping I don't dislocate my knee that week for a second year), but my menu is fairly set. Means waking up early and spending a day cleaning, then waking up early the next day, prepping and preparing homemade brioche, a nice roasted ham, butternut squash risotto for the vegetarians, plus multiple side dishes.

EDIT: actually, OP makes me want to make a Beef Wellington with home made puff pastry, then just triple the pastry recipe and make croissants this year, instead of a huge braided brioche. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The mustard museum in Wisconsin. I'm not sure exactly where, although my mind wants to put it between Madison and Appleton. It's not a specialty local food, but it is a magical place to stop on your food road trip. Sadly, I haven't been since I was a child and didn't want anything to do with mustard, but my parents always made it a priority stop when we were visiting family outside of Madison.

EDIT: on a similar vein, the Boudin sourdough company/factory is San Francisco. Yeah, you can get good sourdough elsewhere, but going on the full tour is amazing. And their bread is still better than any other sourdough I've ever had. My sister, who lives in Berkeley, signs me up for their bread of the month club for my birthday every year. It loses some quality on the trip to Indiana, but is still heavenly for a base for a Jarlsberg and salami sandwich. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm so much in camp A. I actually prefer Voyager to DS9 and TOS. It's tied with TNG, and I consider Enterprise to be different, mainly because the Xindi war just seems like a long movie.

I grew up watching early sci fi movies/shows. Some of the best memories I have with my father involve watching The Day the Earth Stood Still, the Twilight Zone, and the very very old Flash Gordon serials. Captain Proton, to me, is obviously Flash Gordon, which I love so so much.

As for the social commentary, that's a big reason why I love Voyager. Why is a sentient being that happens to be a hologram any different than one who is made of flesh and blood. While he can be grating, the doctor is one of my favorite characters in the whole universe (although Garak will always and forever be my absolute favorite). He has the attitide of Bones (kinda), the empathy and roundedness of Crusher, the uniqueness of Flox, and the intelligence of Bashir. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Convenience is important. Sometimes you're out running errands or have a short break between classes and find yourself starving, but can't go home for whatever reason.

Slightly different, but there is a food truck here that just makes grilled cheeses. They know the college town market well enough to post up outside three of the biggest student bars Thursday through Saturday nights. I get a plain old grilled cheese with orange cheese like petroleum product and fries every time I go out. Yeah, I could walk 10 minutes home and make an amazing roast beef, swiss, and spinach panini on rye with honey and red pepper flake, but then I'd go to sleep instead of staying out with my friends more. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From what I've heard and my minimal experience, you are sometimes backed up for hours out on California freeways. I was once stuck on I465 South of Indy for 90 minutes and only moved about twenty feet. We were good on fuel before that, but the stalling and idling meant that we had to go refuel at the next opportunity. I'm guessing that's an entirely possible situation on most highways, sometimes to the point where you run out of gas when you intended on refuelling. </TEXT>

He was my great uncle (I think that's what you call it, my grandma's brother) and I didn't spend much time with him. But I remember one really powerful event. The whole family went out to dinner, and five minutes after ordering, he turned to my 10-year-old self and told me he couldn't remember what he'd ordered. He almost started crying.

By the end, he was wishing for death because he had been gone for years. The whole family felt the same way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I moved into my first apartment last August and will be living here till August 2016, and I generally agree with this list.

I only have a couple nonstick pans and a few pots. I've dropped hints that a nice, big cast iron Dutch oven is all I want for my birthday, and I'm getting myself a decent thermometer at the same time.

As a college kid, I will say my (totally unnecessary) panini press/griddle is amazing because I can make a quesadilla or grilled cheese without having to fumble around for a spatula; as a baker, last year's birthday present (a super legit KitchenAid stand mixer) is my favorite.

That being said, I'm lucky to have a 1-person apartment with 4 separate rooms. I'm scared for when I have to move and live in a tiny little box. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's important to find one that you like. It takes a while, and I'm personally trying to find just that, after mine had to leave, but a good therapist can mean the word.

The same goes for meds. Maybe you don't even need them, but when you find the right one, the right dosage, the right combination, you'll know, and it will help. I'm lucky in that the one I was given in the hospital after my suicide attempt only took a couple dosage changes to be perfect for me (and it isn't one that is commonly used, from what I've heard, and was only given to me to make me gain weight, which has become a problem now, almost 2 years later), but once I found the perfect dosage, it has been good. I won't deny that I still want to cut sometimes, but I've been able to bounce back from bad news faster than I would have.

I'm sorry if this post isn't helpful, but don't just write off therapy or meds because they haven't worked in the past. If you find one or both that works for you, it can be an enormous help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That makes sense. When I do go out, I spend most of the time at one that is low key mot of the time, although at night it's so full of rowdy college kids. There's a drink there that is officially called "Adios Mother Fucker," although I just call it "that scary blue thing I will never order." Give me a vodka cranberry if I'm feeling rowdier than usual, or just a nice cider, thank you very much. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I winged these, but I've got a basic pattern.

Ch4, sl st into first ch. 
Hdc 8 into hole made by small loop, increase as normal for 2 rounds (2hdc in every st for first, 2 in every other for second)
2 rounds hdc in toe color, change color, 12 rounds hdc.
Change color, ch 1, hdc in next 16 st, ch 1, repeat for 3 more rows.
Sl st rectangle together, tie off.
Make 1 round hdc in heel/toe color, Change color.
9 rounds to make the ankle part.

The key to socks is making them smaller than you think you need. That will keep them from being too bulky. All together, this project took me just under 8 hours. Used some Red Heart Super Saver and an F (3.75) hook, and made sure to work it a litoe tighter than normal.

EDIT:  this pattern is for me, and I wear a size 6.5 shoe. Basically, you continue the rounds until you hit your ankle, then make the heel rectangle until it takes a little stretching to make it cover the rest of the bottom of your foot. The, you can make the rest go as long as you want. The key is to keep trying the first one on at each step, to see how it fits, write down what you do, and do the exact same thing for he second, unless one foot is significantly larger than the other. </TEXT>

Sometimes you still want to go dancing, but perfecting socks is more exciting than spending more by than $20 and still feeling awkward after 3 gin and tonics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Going off the south side comment, 2nd street turns into a highway around the WalMart, and I believe that highway goes to Crane (but don't quote me on that). Once you get past the Kroghetto/hospital area, it's very residential, with fewer students, so if you'd prefer to be away from the craziness, but still close to the bars, I'd suggest looking there. Serendipity, The Root Cellar, The Back Door, and Player's Pub are all 10 or so minutes walking from the hospital, and Brother's, The Vid, and The Bluebird are also fairly close. Sport's is around there, too, but idk if that would be a good fit (I've never been, simply because I've only ever head it touted as "a great place to bang drunk chicks in the bathroom"). </TEXT>

Then again, I may be old school. I wasn't allowed to play video games at all growing up (I played Mario kart for the first time when I was 18), and that probably skewed my views. If I ever uttered the words "I'm bored," I was immediately put to work cleaning or working in the garden. Hell, I spent every summer from age 7 to 15 at a garden camp, and it was amazing until I was put in a junior counselor position (for some reason, everyone assumes girls love small children, who I happen to hate more than most things). </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my experience, old animals know when it's time and will wander, as if to keep the ones who love them from seeing the body. We had a Cocker Spaniel growing up, and right around his 17th birthday, he just wandered off and we never saw him again. That was actually a lot easier for me (I was 13/14) than when we put down our other dog when I was 16. Cody the spaniel was my sister's dog, Buddha was my baby brother (he was only a year younger than me).

I already get very sad thinking about the day I will need to put my cats down, but they are both young still. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've decided to take a short break from my frantic afghan making (3.5 left to do before Xmas, at least two before graduation in May) to make myself a foot cushion.

I have terrible knees and ankles (seeing an orthopedist in a month or so to find out what's really wrong), and when I spend a day working on a project, it's those joints that hurt more than my wrists.

I'm just gonna wing the pattern, but I've never made anything stuffed before. Do I need to make sure that the stitch are especially tight so the filling won't leak out? Could I stuff it in some pantyhose and then into the pillow? One of my cats is notorious for ripping the stuffing out of any toy and trying to eat it, so I'd like to find a way to minimize that.

TL;DR: making my first stuffed object, how can I make sure the stuffing will stay inside? </TEXT>

Home made croissants are also impressive, and take more than 8 hours to make properly. And once you learn how to make that dough, you can make pain au chocolat, or beautiful fruit turnovers, or pretty much anything that requires puff pastry. I'm a girl, so I can vouch that saying "yeah, I made this from scratch" will get me wet, when it comes to puff pastry.  </TEXT>

Basic pattern:

Chain 32 with two strands of the starting color (in this case, green or white)

Dc 14 rows

Tie off one of the strands and switch to the other color.

Dc 14 rows. 

Repeat.

Make the same strips, starting with a solid of the other color, sew then together.

<TEXT> So, I've decided to start a stitch n bitch group on my campus in the fall, and have said that I will teach people the basic stitches (ch, sc, dc, etc.), but just realized that I'm not sure how to go about that.

I know I will start with simple projects, like scarves, wrist warmers, and hats in the round after a while, but I'm not sure how to describe how one does the simple stitches. I know I get confused reading patterns, and I've been crocheting for over a decade. 

Without saying things like "insert hook, yarn over, pull through, yarn over, pull through both loops," how would you describe a sc? I'm guessing these people to be complete newbs, with no experience, and I don't think I can go around the circle teaching everyone separately. </TEXT>

My friends say I'm the queen of freezing (I regularly buy meat the day before the sell by date and freeze individual portions), but I'm never sure about fish.

As background, I'm in Indiana, so most of the fish I get has either already been frozen and rethawed (bacteria if I freeze it again?) or really expensive.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Even though it's summer (at least where I am), I'd suggest a soup. I'm not sure if the exact recipe, but my mother makes a great soup with kale, leeks, wild rice, and turkey.

My tip is to find meats at the store that are super in sale (for me it's usually because their sell by date is the next day), portion the chops into bags, and freeze. I can make one package of frozen chicken breasts (usually around $4) and two packages of pasta (~$2 each) last a week when I have veggies, butter/oil, spices, and a dozen eggs (~$3 here). </TEXT>

Last year, I made a bunch of spicy Asian inspired dishes with the 2+ pounds of mulberries my friends and I picked.

<TEXT> After reading through that website (thank you!), I think I will try to get to know this kitty for a bit.

Where I grew up, there were a lot of ferals and strays, so I've learned the difference. The cat my parents currently have was a stray that took more than a year to get close to us.

This cat has only been out during the day, and has come fairly close to me. I think she's a stray, not feral, from my experience. I did call the shelter to ask what I should do, but I will wait a bit before taking her there.

I will continue to leave food out, as she seems quite skinny, and see if she becomes more used to my presence.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Tuxedo cat with no tail around S. Fess </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-03 13:11:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello! I've been seeing a tuxedo cat with no tail wandering around my apartment for a few weeks now.

S/he seems to be an adult, probably 18 months or older, black with a white stomach and face, with no tail.

I don't think anyone would let their cat roam around outside in this area (Fess and Atwater) because there's way too many cars and streets, so I'm thinking it may be lost or a stray.

If you know anyone who is missing a cat with this description, please let me know. I'm planning on asking around, and if none of my neighbors know whose it is, I will try to lure it near so I can get it to the shelter.

Update: upon closer inspection, s/he seems a little raggedy, but definitely not feral. I will be working to gain his/her trust for a while, to see if s/he truly can be socialized. It looks like s/he has been out for quite a while, but still hmu if you know anyone who has lost a similar cat. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's been a tuxedo with no tail wandering around my neighborhood for a few weeks now. S/he looks fairly well taken care of, like s/he may have been a housecat, but I'm in an area surrounded by apartments, near streets, so I don't think anyone would let their cat be an outsider.

Should I leave out some food to lure her/him near so I can take her/him to the shelter? Once I can think everyone will be awake, I'm gonna go around and ask about it, but I feel so sad thinking that this beautiful cat isn't being taken care of. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know I'm a bit late, but I just need to rave about a store I found I couple weeks ago when I was traveling for my sister's hooding (also congrats to her for being almost done with her Ph.D!!) Sorry in advance for the book.

There's this show store in Berkeley, California called The Walk Shop. Their motto is "shoes for people who walk." The entire point is shoes that are comfortable. 

I did ballet for 9 years. I'm 21 years old, and have legitimate arthritis in my knees and I don't remember the last time one or both of my ankles hasn't hurt, sometimes to the point that I ha e to take a sick day for it because I literally can't walk.

I got these ( http://www.imgur.com/fVilOdH.jpeg) for her commencement, and I have literally never had more comfortable shoes. And they're cute as heck, at least to me. They're Cobb Hill brand, and have changed my life. I didn't realize that shoes could be cute AND make me not want to cut off my legs after a full day on my feet.

/rave, anyone in that area should def look this place up. A lot of their stuff is not the most stylish, but I saw a huge amount of cute things that felt just amazing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just finished COLL-C105, Quantum Mysteries for Everyone as my breadth of inquiry class. If you've taken any physics class ever, it's too easy to explain. But I spent half of high school assuming I'd be a physics major, before switching to political science after 3 weeks, haha.

I've also heard people say POLS-Y105, intro to political theory, is a gen ed (idk, I'm a poli sci major), and I also just finished it and it was awesome. A lot of reading, but amazing. However, I'd say to wait until Prof. Craiutu is back from his sabbatical. I took his classes 3 semesters in a row, and I feel bad for anyone taking any political theory class that isn't taught by him.

My knowledge is mainly in the poli sci department, but I will say DO NOT take POLS-Y103, intro to comparative politics, or really any comparative politics classes, unless you absolutely have to. 

Sorry if you're in the majority that doesn't like politics at all, that's just the experience I have.

Tl;dr: if you can wait a year or so to get your gen ed out of the way, take POLS-Y105, when Prof. Craiutu is teaching it, but be prepared to read a lot. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Finals Week comfort food (hush puppies/johnny cakes and roast vegetable curry) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-07 12:05:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello all!

In this week of super stress, I like to make two of my most comforting foods: fried dough and curry.

http://www.imgur.com/ithjHq5.jpeg
Here are the hush puppies. 

1 box Jiffy mix
2 eggs
~1/2-3/4 cup each corn and diced onion (I used frozen because it's what I had)
Vegetable oil to fry
Salt, red pepper flake, and garlic powder to taste

Mix together all the ingredients in a bowl.
Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a skillet. I don't have a thermometer, but most recipes say 350 is what you want.
Drop small spoonfuls of the corn mix into the oil, fry until golden brown, flip, and transfer to a plate with paper towels. I found that these cooked up really fast, maybe a minute on one side and 30 seconds on the other.
Add salt, pepper, whatever (I really wanted Old Bay, but didn't have any) while they're still hot.

I think if I could have actually deep fried these, they would have been more like hush puppies. Really they were more like fried cornbread blobs, but they were still delicious. 

http://www.imgur.com/P4Tah1S.jpeg
And this is roasted cauliflower and carrot curry. This I didn't measure at all, so I'll guesstimate. It ended up with about three servings.

The veggies:
1 cup each frozen cauliflower florets and sliced carrots (again, frozen is all I have right now)
2 tbl curry powder
Salt to taste
~1 tbl vegetable oil, to drizzle on top

Spread the veggies evenly on a baking dish
Sprinkle curry powder and salt on top, mix to coat
Drizzle oil on top
Roast in a 425 oven for 25 minutes

The rice/sauce:
1 cup rice (before cooking) + water to cover one inch above
1/4 stick butter
Flour (sorry, I have no idea how much)
~1/4 cup curry powder
Water
Salt and red pepper flake to taste

Cook the rice as directed (I did it in the microwave because I'm lazy and made this at 5am)
In a saucepan, melt the butter. Add the flour and make a roux (continue stirring until it creates a paste).
Add more curry powder and water to make it more saucy.
Add the vegetables and cooked rice into the sauce, mix well, add salt/pepper/whatever to taste.

I wish I had had coconut milk or chicken stock for this, but I was just using what I had.

For some reason, these are two of my favorite comfort foods. I'm broke as a joke, so I didn't have the options I usually would. However, they still turned out pretty well. Adapt, adopt, and improve. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a friend who takes forever to order and likes to make her own thing. We went to one of the student bars on a busy night one time and she spent 15 minutes going back and forth with things like "I want something chocolatey," "oooh, raspberry or strawberry vodka," "what would go well with that," etc. The bartender had to leave to treat the regulars, and she ended up with something like "two shots of Bailey's, half a shot of raspberry vodka, some chocolate liqueur, and the rest with tonic water." I felt so bad, I just got a rum and coke.

I'm guessing most bartenders would be happy to serve you anything normal, so long as you know what you want before you bother them. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Failure </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-06 10:43:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I failed two classes this semester. I've been too sad to go to class, so the ones that take attendance failed me. They were both major classes.

I drink too much. I know I do, and I know it's a problem. But drunk is pretty much the only time I don't feel miserable.

I graduated high school 6th in my class. My gpa was 3.86. I was depressed, but it came so easily to me. Now, after my third year of college, I'll be lucky to have a 2.3. 

I just haven't cared all semester, and now I feel like a complete failure. I'm afraid to see my family. My sister is about to get her Ph.D. from one of the best schools in the country. My dad has one in physics, and recently got sober.

I can't even work up the energy to cry. I'm broke, so I can't even buy booze to make myself feel better. Even my cats don't make me feel any better about myself.

I've gained a bunch of weight, I haven't showered in a week, and I never see any friends. I still have two more finals and I don't care, but I know I need to step it up if I want to not fail all of my classes.

It's getting time where I have to start worrying about getting jobs. I'm gonna have to take a victory lap, which my parents are fine with, but I may even need two. I'm going part time next semester, for sure, but I have no idea what I'm going to do with my life. I've always dreamed of working in the government, but I'm so far from the cream of the crop that I'm that rejected corn that gives livestock mad cow. I had to drop my French major, which means my fallback of becoming a French teacher isn't even a possibility anymore.

I've wanted to do the Peace Corps for forever, but I doubt I can bring my cats with me to Africa, and I doubt even more that I can go two years without them. On top of that, they wouldn't accept me with my grades.

Tl;dr: I failed my first two classes ever this semester, I feel like a failure, and I have no idea what I'm going to do with my life. All I wanna do is cry, and I can't even do that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recently quit smoking weed. I don't remember the last time I was this anxious. 

I wake up multiple times a night after having falling nightmares. I've been dreaming otherwise about a man who emotionally abused me. 

I get drunk all day, every day. I don't remember the last day I didn't get drunk. I get the shakes every morning, and I don't feel normal unless I'm drunk.

About a month ago, my dad finally went into alcohol rehab. He's now in an Intensive Outpatient Program for it. 

When I was six, I remember him teaching me that a certain hand gesture meant "go get me another beer." And I'm turning into him.

The last time I went without booze for 3 days, I had to talk myself down from cutting or trying to kill myself multiple times a day. I hate that a handle lasts me two days; I hate that I need to bring a flask with me to class; I hate that I need to get drunk to spend time with my family; I hate that more than half of my money goes to booze. But most of all, I'm terrified of what could happen if I were to quit. </TEXT>

I've literally never done anything to my brows. Never plucked, never gotten them shaped, never filled them in--nothing. I know they could be better, although I've gotten compliments on them before

What should I do? I just bought my first pair of tweezers, but I'm scared of over-plucking.

Also excuse the early morning, no makeup face.

EDIT: here's a side view http://www.imgur.com/VaBMLfm.jpeg

EDIT 2: I don't want to go get it done professionally, I don't have anywhere near me besides a threading place that is notorious for making brows way too thin. And I really enjoy doing things myself.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This. I've stopped looking both ways before I cross the street because I honestly don't care if I were to get hit by a car, but I'm taking steps. 

I relapsed last week after 18 months, and the last time was when I attempted suicide. 

The first step is to try hard to be not miserable. While that is a far cry from happy, it can be liberating. Try to see the silver linings. I know myself well enough to know that I will never be a "glass half full" type of person, so I try to look for the silver linings. I slipped on the ice and dislocated my knee, but I got a legit knee brace put of it, which I've needed for years. 

We all know it's hard. It's harder than a lot of things. It's a legitimate addiction, but there's no self-harm anonymous. The most we can do is try. 

Try every day. Use a rubber band, call a friend, go play with kitties at the shelter, anything. And, most of all, know that there are people who care. You're free to PM me anytime. If need be, I'll give you my number so you have someone to call. 

I don't know you, but I care about you. You deserve to live. You deserve to feel better. You deserve to be (at least) not miserable.  </TEXT>

I've been trying feeding them separately, but they're still stealing. It's been better, though, because they steal mutually now. They eat half a bowl of food, then they switch and eat the other's half. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you, like everyone else has said.   My vet at home was a lot like you: caring, thoughtful, and wonderful. He understood when my whole family was there, bawling their eyes out, when we had to finally put the family dog down. He had arthritis, and we think diabetes, along with doggy Alzheimer's. He would forget to eat for days, then had seizures because his blood sugar was too low. 

You are a great person for feeling how hard it is to put down a pet. It's usually for their own good, because they simply can't understand the horrible things happening to them. My Buddha was 15 when we put him down, and I was only 16. He was my baby brother, and I still visit where we buried him fairly often. 

Again, thank you. I hope all vets are like you, and mine at home. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've searched and didn't find a good answer.

I brought a new cat into my home, and the two are getting along swimmingly. But, the newbie (Bill, around a year old, same as Kate, the original one) keeps stealing Kate's food. I still have the bowls in separate rooms, but once Bill finishes his food, he goes into the other room and eats most of Kate's. 

Is there any way I can keep him from doing this? I've taken him away when I catch him doing it, but he's much bigger than Kate, and I think he bullies her away from it.

Tl;dr: new cat eats old cat's food, and I want to make sure they're both eating enough. Worried about old cat's eating habits, since the newbie eats most of hers. 

EDIT: As background, Kate is an exceptionally small cat. She was even smaller than the normal runt of her litter. Bill is already fairly round, I call him "fatty Mcfatface" as a joke. Kate is fairly skinny, and I'm not sure if it's just because she has a small build,  or if it's because Bill steals her food. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know the argument has been made many times that we shouldn't judge a girl on her size. Saying "a real man loves a girl with curves" is just as bad as saying "anything more than a handful is a waste."

I've gained 20 pounds in the last few months. I mean, I was considered "too thin" before that, but I have always been self conscious about how small my tits are. But even after gaining all that weight, due to stress, depression, and how much easier it is to order food than to cook for yourself, my tits are still less than one of my handfuls. And, for my whole life, I have been called "baby hands." I hate it. 

I feel fat, because I have a noticeable stomach pudge. I can't fit into a lot of the clothes I bought last fall, when I was put on medicine that I was told would make me gain weight. To put it into perspective, when I was put on that medicine, I was 5'8" and 112 pounds. When I felt healthy finally, I was at 125. I'm not was 145, and I was told at the doctor's that my blood pressure was higher than it should be.

I've been watching what I eat, I quit smoking so I could finally even make it to the gym without feeling like I had finally had a full workout.

But I hate so much the idea that "anything more than a handful is a waste." Even though I'm not fit, I feel fat as hell, my tits are still not a real person's handful.

Can we stop with this dichotomy of "real men prefer girls with curves" and "more than a handful is a waste?" It hurts, even for those of us who are on the smaller end of the spectrum. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I want to go to mass. I want to go to confession. The ritual and the idea on confessing all the bad you've done seems really appealing to me. I'd never take communion, because I think it would be offensive to take the body and blood of something I don't believe in, but the structure, the moral directives, the forgiveness appeals to me so much.

I think of religion as something to make you be a good person. And if you need an invisible man in the sky to make you a good person, I am completely fine with it. I don't; I want to be a good person because the world has seen too much injustice, too much hate.

But the structure that church can give you seems great to me. </TEXT>

2 pounds ground pork
1/2 cup garlic breadcrumbs
5-6 shiitake mushrooms, sliced
1/2-3/4 cup frozen pepper-onion blend from Kroger.
2 eggs
Hoisin and sriracha to cover.

Mix pork, breadcrumbs, and eggs together. Sweat onions and peppers, add mushrooms and saute until lightly wilted. Mix vegetables into the pork mixture. Put in loaf pan, and cover with hoisin sauce and sriracha. Bake for an hour, turn off oven and let sit inside for another ten minutes. Let sit for at least another ten minutes. </TEXT>

The shelter told me that he was brought in after someone's cat had kittens and couldn't handle them all. He was adopted once, and a week later, he was brought back in as a stray. His first adoptive owner never came for him when they called. 

He is seriously the sweetest cat I've ever met. He crawled into my lap immediately at the shelter, and spends most of his time there now.

I just don't understand at all how someone could give him up. He's so wonderful.

I am working on my first afghan ever, which I hope to give to my grandmother for her 92nd birthday on 3/15. I started it on Saturday, and am already making a lot of progress. However, I still think that I'll need to spend every free moment to work on it to get it done in time. 

I brought it to class with me today, because I've got about an hour in between some classes, but it is already so big that it takes up so much space in my backpack.

How do y'all deal with traveling with a huge project? Is there a magical folding technique I could use? If not, do y'all have any tips for bringing a project with you to places?

Tl;dr: how can I bring the afghan I'm working on with me without taking up a lot of space in my backpack? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello, another question. I trust Reddit on cat information.

I'm planning on adopting a new cat this Friday, because my 10.5-month old needs a friend. I'm planning on getting someone a little older than her. Do I need to make sure to get separate food for him? My current kitty is pretty much done growing at this point, and has started eating less (I fill her bowl up twice a day and she hasn't finished it in 30 minutes anymore), so I was wondering if I could start the switch to adult food yet. Or, could I feed a 12-15 month old kitten food for a couple months? I can afford getting separate food, but it would be nice if I could use the same.

Tl;dr: getting a new cat, hopefully not a kitten. Could I use the same food with my 10.5-month-old as a more adult cat? Either switch the current one to adult food or give the newbie kitten food. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I posted a question a couple weeks ago regarding computer cords and that foul tasting nail polish designed to help you quit biting your nails. 

I've been putting a coat on a couple times a week and my cat hasn't chewed on my charger at all. I saw her try when I first did it, and she was licking her lips and I could tell that she had an unpleasant taste in her mouth.

Hope this is useful to anyone else. It's been a great solution for me.

When I want to make a pattern, I just make a second of the same project. I write down what I remember doing for the first time, with plenty of room for notes. As I work up the new version, I change the blueprint as needed.

That said, I've only written three or four patterns before, and it was mainly to keep track of things when I was making big projects. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't have the money right now for a new one, I'm probably going to put a little away until Spring Break. 

Should I put my current cat's litter box near the door? The only viable option in my apartment for that would be to have the litter box in my bedroom, in front of the bathroom door, and I would almost certainly step in it.

If I put two hanging toys on either side of the doorknob, would that help socialize them when I'm in class?

I plan on going to the shelter fairly often to play with the available cats, and see which ones have similar personalities. I just think someone with almost as much energy would chill her out so much, because she's always running around and trying to play with everything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've searched, so I know the basics of bringing a new cat home, but my situation leaves me with some questions.

Katie is a 10-month-old barn cat. She's been with me and strictly indoor since she was 12 weeks old, but she is sassy and spastic as hell. We've had playdates with other people's cats, and she has always terrorized them, even though she's tiny. My best friend's 13 pound Mane Coon hides whenever they've been together. 

Is she too much of a terrorist to adapt to another cat?

Also, my apartment only has one inside door, in the bathroom, and my bathroom is tiny. To keep them separate for a bit, would keeping the newbie in the bathroom be ok?

Katie lived with two rabbits for a couple months, and got along great with them, but I'm definitely not getting a rabbit (I lost so many cords in my 2.5 months of living with rabbits).

She is seriously tiny. She's maybe 7 pounds, was the runt of her litter, and hasn't gotten any bigger for a few months.

EDIT: I'd go to shelter and see what's available, but I think getting a fixed male between 8 months and 1.5 years old would be best. I think she'd get along better with a rambunctious friend who's bigger than her.

Tl;dr: I think my cat could use a friend, but she's always terrorizing any other cat she's met. My apartment is small. Could I get another cat and keep him in my bathroom? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ive had incredible luck when it comes to acne/clogged pores. I wash my face every time I shower and have never had a serious breakout.

I'll prolly just use my vegetable oil, because most of the benefits of coconut oil I already have: my hair grows too fast; I use henna to dye my hair, which conditions; I don't scar too bad. </TEXT>

<TITLE> DIY lip exfoliant question </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-18 16:24:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've searched both here and /r/MakeupAddiction, and couldn't find an answer to this specifically.

I've seen a lot of posts saying sugar+olive oil is a good lip exfoliant, but I usually don't keep olive oil in my house (my family has a history of low cholesterol, so I use butter for everything). Would sugar+vegetable oil do the same thing? I've got vegetable oil for in case I decide to make a cake from a mix.

Tl;dr: does sugar+vegetable oil exfoliate lips as much as sugar+olive oil? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, my problem is that she pretty much only chews when I'm not watching, which makes me think that she knows not to do it. 

I'm trying the Bite-It for now, but I've got lemon spray too, if I find her chewing. She tried earlier and was then licking her lips to get the taste off, and I'm guessing the tiny bit she might get from that won't be too bad for her. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Question about anti-biting polish and power cords </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I asked a similar question on a thread in /r/cats, but you ladies (and gents) might know, too.

My 10-month old kitten chews on my MacBook charger and ruins it. I'm going to buy my third in a month, and at $80 a pop, it's getting expensive. She only does it when I'm not looking, which makes me think she already knows not to do it.

Can you coat a charger with that foul tasting nail polish designed to help you quit biting your nails? I think that would deter her, but I'm not sure if it's safe for the charger or the cat. I know not to use anything spicy, but no-bite is just chemicals that taste horrid (I've used it, and the spicy kind, which just made me want to suck on my fingers more because I love spicy food). If not, I can get some bitter apple stuff, as /r/cats suggested, but it's a long hike followed by a long bus ride to get to a pet store here. Maybe Kroger would have some in the pet department.

Tl;dr: cat chews on power cord. Can I coat my new charger in no-bite to keep her from ruining another? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know this is an old post, but do you think coating the cord in that foul tasting nail polish designed to help you quit biting your nails? Would that damage the cord? I'm about to buy my third MacBook charger in a month, just because I take away any short strings so my baby won't choke.

EDIT: I think she knows not to do it, because I never see her chewing, but when I come back inside after a smoke, the cord is ruined. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been crocheting for about 10 years now. My mother taught me the basics, and I just figured the rest out for myself. About 4 years ago I finally realized that what I had been calling single crochet was actually a slip stitch, and my double crochet was actually single. 

I've tried following patterns for things in the past, and the things always end up too big or just strange. I can kind of read them (at least, I understand the whole "ch4, slst into first, ch1 and dc into next st, repeat 4 times" thing, but nothing ever works right.

That being said, I have successfully made hats, socks, scarves, and even a dress with my limited knowledge. If I want a fancy stitch, I can look up the stitch itself and then incorporate it into whatever I'm making. Patterns can be nice for a basis (I needed on to figure out heels the first time I made socks), but I find it much easier to just do my own thing. Increase, decrease as you need to, but once you know sc, dc, inc, and dec, you can make anything. Anything that requires a close fit, just make sure to fit check every couple of rows (when I made socks for the first time, I slipped them on even more often) and don't be afraid to undo a lot of work if something didn't go well (I also had to redo the toes on my first pair of socks ~6 times).

Idk the point of this post, really, but I searched for something similar, and nothing really came up.

TL;DR: you don't have to be able to read patterns to make things, you just need to be willing to do fit checks super often, and to pull things out if you realize what you're doing is wrong. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've made several. First, measure from your waist to however long you want your skirt to be. Then, measure around your waist and every couple of inches going down the length. Divide each of these numbers in four. Cut two kinda funky rectangles that are as long as you want and as wide as you need at each point you measured. I usually put dots at each measurement point, then connect them. Using the same measurements, cut the front on the fold so it will fall flat. Sew all the rectangles together, put a zipper in the back, hem, and voila!

This is how I always make them, although having a waistband could be nice, too. There are better tutorials with picture online. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello all! 

I decided for my new year's resolution that I would become more of a beer connoisseur. Both my local grocery store and my local health food store have really excellent build-your-own six pack selections, so I've been picking up one or two of those a week.

To be honest, I prefer a good cider to just about anything (Harpoon Craft Cider is my favorite thing ever), but I also like a good beer. However, most of the selection at Kroger is ipa's and apa's. I'm really not a fan of pale ales, or really anything that is super hoppy, but I'd like to build a taste for it.

Wheat beers are probably my favorite, and Upland Wheat Ale is one of my favorite beers, although that might just be because it's widely available where I live. Of the mix-a-sixes I've made, my favorites were Baltika #4   9, Two Brothers Ebel's Weiss, and Boulevard Unfiltered Wheat beer.

What are your recommendations to start my journey away from dark lagers and wheat ales?

To;Dr: I would like to expand my beer horizons, especially when it comes to pale ales and strong hoppy flavors. What do you recommend?

EDIT: the mix-a-six at my Kroger today had both Founder's all day ipa (which wasn't the best) and Harpoon ipa (which is pretty good). Thanks for the suggestions, y'all! I hope the health food store is open the next time I want a mix-a-six, because I know their selection is better.

EDIT 2: I also got some gumballhead, which is a good beer for those in my situation, who love wheat beer and want to learn to like hoppy beers. It's a good middle ground. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've come to the realization that I am a boring individual. I have no hobbies, I don't branch out, and I'm sad most of the time.

I go to class, then I sit and watch Netflix and get drunk until I go to bed. Due to injuries, there are very few physical activities I can do without immense pain, and the only other things I do for fun (crochet, baking) are entirely solo.

I've been dating around, looking for someone I have anything in common with, and simply haven't been able to. I thought it was because I hadn't found anyone I'm really interested in, but that's not it. It's because I have nothing to have in common with someone.

TL; DR: I'm boring, and I don't know how to change it.

EDIT: Thank you all for your comments. Unfortunately, I just started Christmas break, but you all have helped me think that maybe I should just go do things. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Yet another Holiday Party post </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-12-18 13:56:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello all!

I've been invited to a holiday party for the office where I worked for a year. I quit in August, because I was too busy to continue working there, but I still think I should make an appearance, because I loved the job and it gave me so many connections.

As background, the office was on my college campus, and focuses on educating the public about Congress. My boss was a former Congressman. The party is for every faculty and staff member in the department, which include my former Congressman boss and a former Senator from my state.

While I've been told by several people that faculty parties are generally not super fancy, I believe that this one is a bit different. In the year I worked there, I never saw a man out of a suit and woman in anything other than business. My office was business casual, but I was usually the least well-dressed person there, even in pencil skirts and cardigans. 

I recently slipped on the ice and dislocated my knee, and am finally off crutches, but I don't think that I can handle anything other than sneakers or snow boots. However, I think I'd be able to switch into nicer shoes for the small amount of time I'll be there, and I've also got a pair of nice black, flat oxfords that would be acceptable. It is from 3:30-5:30, but I'll have to leave by 4:30 to get to a final.

I have a few ideas as to what to wear. I've got a deep purple velvet dress, which I usually put with mustard tights and brown heels, as well as a huge number of different colored pencil skirts, which I'd pair with a nice white button-down. Any advice you could give me would be very much appreciated. I'm broke, so I can't buy anything new, but I have a few things fancier than what I usually wore to the office.

TL;DR: Holiday party tomorrow from 3:30-5:30pm, for faculty and staff of a school in which I worked in an office for a year. I would assume business casual to semi-formal, except to attendees will be a former Congressman and a former Senator. HALP! </TEXT>

<TEXT> This post: http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1ru7q4/can_we_stop/

I hardly go on /r/trees anymore, because it's so filled with boys (not men) and posts that just don't interest me much, but this post came up on my front page yesterday, and it got me thinking. I've pretty much only had dates recently from dating sites, because I'm too awkward to actually ask people out in person (unless I'm high, and I don't like being high in public). My profile talks about Mary Jane, because it's a big deal in my life, and I usually only respond to people who also talk about it, or at least have answered questions by saying that they smoke. 

Do you ladies look for men who smoke? I often do, like I said, but that is far from enough to make me want to be with them as anything but smoking buddies. Also, have you ever experienced being "put on a pedestal?" I have some female friends who talk a lot about how they get to smoke for free most of the time, and that they have joined a group of men smoking a bowl, just because they wanted company (this was mainly true when all my friends and I lived in a dorm and we had a smoking area for cigarettes that most of us used to smoke weed), and have been passed the bowl without asking and after having said that they were just out of a cigarette or company and weren't trying to be smoked out.

TL;DR: Do you specifically look for men who smoke when trying to find someone to date? Have you ever experienced being "put on a pedestal" for being an girl who smokes? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Interview at my Head Shop! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-11-12 14:51:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello all! I usually just lurk and comment 'round these parts, but I have a question that I think you ladies will be able to answer better than /r/femalefashionadvice , even though this is usually their territory.

As the title says, I have a job interview at my head shop tomorrow morning, and I am at a complete loss as to what to wear. I know for regular interviews you want business casual, or at least nicer clothes. But the head shop is so different from every other employer I've had, and I want to work there so so badly. The people working are pretty strictly jeans and t-shirt, but I want to make an impression that doesn't scream "she's trying too hard." Even though they dress so casually, I'm still thinking nicer pants (because all my jeans are torn up/worn out) or a casual skirt + tights (because it'll be below freezing when I need to be there) and a t-shirt (probably a Slytherin one I have because it's my absolute favorite and I feel so wonderful in it), but I'm not sure if even that's too casual.

Thank you in advance, I know you ladies know how to help another entwife in need.

EDIT: I'm also meeting the owner (whom I've never met, even though the employees know me by name and know exactly what type of papes I want), and the interview is at 8:30am (not at all hard for me to be awake for).

tl;dr: I've got an interview at my local head shop tomorrow and I have no idea what to wear. HALP! Please.

EDIT 2: Thank you so much for the help, everyone. I had the interview this morning, ended up in the black pencil skirt + black tights + Slytherin t-shirt, and I think it went really well. If anything, I showed how punctual I am, because I was there 5 minutes before the interviewer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've gone through two pairs of 5fingers and I love them so much. I had a grey/bright blue pair that I wore nearly every day for three summers, and a grey/strange army-ish green pair that is nearing the end. 

I'm generally less concerned with how my feet look because (due to years joint damage) if I do, my knees/hips/back hurt badly enough to not get out of bed for a few days afterwards. However, I just treated my vibrams like any other shoe. The green pair works really well with all the earth tones I wear, and I think all black Mary Jane-style ones are some of the cutest things ever. They really don't look much different from other black shoes, and if someone is seriously disturbed by them, they need to figure out why feet are so "gross." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not a vegetarian, but I often cook big dinners with my friends, many of whom are.

My favorite non-meat protein sources are edamame (green soybeans) and the combination of peas and pasta (together they make a complete protein.) Edamame is great because you can put some frozen beans in tupperware and they'll be thawed and the perfect temperature by lunch. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1) seriously, go to class.

2) take anything and everything that seems interesting, at least at first, to find something you're really passionate about. I'm a junior picking up Arabic because I like languages.

3) read for class and do your homework. 

4) learn to take good notes. This means (at least for me) outline style, with the main points copied from the PowerPoint and subheadings from discussion.

5) no matter how dumb you think you might sound, speak up in class. This is especially important in language classes, because it allows your professor to help you with pronunciation and grammar.

6) eat dinner at Collins. Or just go to Collins as often as possible. But I'm biased on that front (lived there for two years).

7) take a class with Aurelian Craiutu. Seriously, this guy is the best there is. He's Political Science, but teaches other classes, too. He will challenge you and won't accept bullshit. I took Modern Political Thought with him last semester and am taking Classical in the fall (Y382   381, respectively), but he also does a class on happiness that I want to take so badly.

8) don't commit dormcest. It WILL be awkward.

9) your UD advisor is going to be shitty, no matter what. Deal with it, cuz you won't need him/her for long.

10) DON'T. EVER. SMOKE. WEED. IN. YOUR. DORM. ROOM. EVEREVEREVEREVER.

Edit: 11) get a job at some point, even if it's just for a summer. You don't want to graduate with a four-year-old resume, or worse, no resume at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Perhaps I just had a shitty therapist, but all I ever got from it was "you have a chemical imbalance in your brain, sucks, don't it?" Therapy just made me focus more on the stupid things, trying to figure out why they bother me. It ended up making me feel super self-absorbed, to the point that my very best friend told me to either change or get out of her life.

I worry less about what other people currently think, but rather what they may do if I pursue a certain want. 

I suppose my biggest concern with this philosophy is that it seems like it just makes us all into selfish little twats. All I want to do is help people less fortunate than I, but I get so caught up in how I might be hurting them that I just assume that everyone is better off without me. I know it's not true, but that little voice is constantly telling me I'm a burden or a bother. I've been getting better at pushing it aside, but sometimes I just can't see the point, if it's just going to come back.

Tl;dr: maybe I just can't not give fucks, when my ultimate goal is to help others. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been lurking on this sub for a while now. Every post is full of "your problems don't matter" or "just do it" or "be confident."

It isn't that easy. Anxiety is part of my identity. It's like telling someone with clinical depression to "just be happy." It's pointless, and a little bit offensive. I checked the sidebar, and in the "how to start not giving a fuck" post, literally all of them seem like completely insurmountable goals. How do you go from not knowing what self-confidence feels like to being super confident all the time?

I'd love to take your advice. But it's like telling rabbits to stop fucking and pooping. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is the best advice on this topic I've ever heard.

OP, everyone has to deal with relationships that just aren't right. And it hurts, because unless you're a sociopath, it really sucks to hurt someone else. I had a terrible, controlling, legitimately insane SO for a while. I loved him more than I could possibly say. I still do, even just for the good memories we made together. But we just weren't good together. "test_subject2886, shut up, you're about to say something you know nothing about" was a common thread. When I finally realized it wasn't working out, I agonized over the decision for weeks. I felt guilty for months afterward.

I've now been away from him for a year, and it was the best decision I've ever made. No one deserves a shitty relationship, but they help us figure out better what we need for a healthy, thriving one. So buy yourself some Ben Jerry's and remember that you've gotten through this frog, so you know you can do it again if you have to.

Tl;dr: we all have to deal with bad relationships so we can figure out what we need. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, long story short, I make really idiotic decisions when it comes to boys.

I got played like a card by this guy for six months and all I have to show for it is a diagnosis of major depressive disorder and a short hospital stay. I decided it was a great idea to Facebook stalk him for a little bit tonight, and I ended up bawling my eyes out, just like every time I see or think about him too much.

I know that drinking my problems away will be bad in the long run, but tonight I'm killing what's left of a fifth of Captain and realizing that his new girlfriend is probably smart and funny and everything I'm not, but still holding onto the fact that she makes Sarah Jessica Parker look like she doesn't have a horsr face.

Tl;dr: fuck boys, fuck Facebook, and fuck ugly bitches. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going to give an opinion right now that I know is incredibly unpopular in this subreddit, because it's worked for me many a time.

I enjoy faking orgasms. I am a fairly orgasmic person, though. Usually what happens is that I'll be able to tell that a guy is about to come, and I start contracting my muscles. Doing that (depending on the position) also forces my hips into a position where my clit is getting stimulation, and seeing the guy feeling me get close usually sends me over into a real orgasm.

I have completely faked them during random hookups when I just knew that it wasn't going to go anywhere, and I don't find a problem with that. If you don't care for the person, an you know he won't be inside you again, you can do whatever you want, because the next person he sleeps with will be different from you and he'll have to learn how to please her specifically. </TEXT>

<TITLE> A couple quick Seche Vite questions </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-02-19 01:34:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello all!

Today I splurged a finally got myself a bottle of Seche Vite. I used it straightaway but have a few questions. I searched and a few questions were resolved, but these ones I couldn't find answers to.

I didn't run into this today, but if I need two coats of a polish to get it opaque, do I need to let the separate layers dry before putting on the next coat, or should I do them all quickly and then seche on top while they're all still tacky? I don't mean between base color and art, that question has been resolved time and time again, I mean with light colors that require more than one coat to be opaque.

Secondly, how thick is a "thick coat" of SV? I figured it meant pretty think, but I got bubbles in it today. I know it isn't from the polish underneath, because I didn't see the bubbles while I was waiting for the polish to go from really wet to slightly tacky.

Thank you all so much! This stuff really is magical. </TEXT>

My suggestion is to stabilize your non-dominant hand with your dominant one. Put your dominant pinkie on your non-dominant palm for painting the thumb, then do the same with your thumb for the others. Works for me on both sides, since I have really shaky hands. </TEXT>

Next year, I shall be able to go to the liquor store and will be doing so for the family (I'm the one who always gets the stuff for food anyway, they told me they can't wait till I can buy the booze, too). Scotch and ginger ale. Seems bad, considering teh cost of the Scotch, but fuck it, I gotta pilfer anyways. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I personally can't tell a difference between any type of condom, or between sex with a condom and bareback.

The one thing I *can* tell, is the difference between a condom with spermicide and any other type of sex. I know it's probably just me, because I am violently allergic to the stuff (like, lips swell shut and out, sitting down is really painful for a few days), but I've heard from other non-allergic people that it is drying and irritating. 

I'd say go for normal lubrication on your rubbers, in case she is allergic. Because if allergic reactions in your nose or eyes are bad, allergic reactions on your ladybits are awful. </TEXT>

I have to reference a couple works of 19th century French literature (can you tell yet that I'm a French major?) which, from my knowledge of the texts, all have to do with either "love makes life miserable" or "everything in my life sucks and I hate it all." I get to write two short papers for the class, so one is dealing with love, the other will be dealing with how literature from before modern psychology effected the idea that mental health is something that one should be at least reasonably knowledgeable about.

<TITLE> Trees are the best medication money can buy. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello trees. I recently got arrested and had to give up the herb for a few months. I want to tell you all the story of how I learned that this plant is the best medication I could every ask for.

I'm a young female ent. I'm in college. I have a family history of depression, anxiety, OCD, and alcoholism. The first three have plagued me my whole life.

I did ballet for nine years growing up, which is not a healthy environment for a kid. It forces you, from a very young age, to try for perfection in every aspect of your life, which is simply unattainable and unhealthy. At age 12 I started cutting myself to cope with the feelings of inadequacy. By age 15 I was doing it every day. At 16 I was put on anti-anxiety medication by a doctor, which made me feel like an empty shell of a person. Instead of anxious and all the other emotions, I just felt no emotions. I was a bitch, and more people than I can count called me crazy on a daily basis. I didn't have any real friends, I never saw anyone outside of school.

Right before I graduated high school, I found an old childhood friend on Facebook. The same day he added me, he messaged me telling me we should hang out. Two hours later, I was in his car with some of his friends on the way to a beautiful lake in the country. We swim for a while, then get back up on the dock. He whips out a joint and lights it up. When he passed it to me, I said I had never smoked before, and his face instantly lit up. "Try it," he said, "you'll like it."

I had never felt so uplifted and happy in my life. It was like all the unnecessary, stupid worries that had always plagued me were dissolved from my brain. I just started laughing uncontrollably, almost crying because I had never been as relaxed as I was then.

I smoked every day for a year and a half. I got arrested, and as part of the treatment program the man put me in, I have to pass two piss tests. It has been two weeks today. I feel like I did for the six years leading up to that day. I have either gotten drunk or cut myself every day. I hate it. It is unhealthy, makes me feel like shit the next day, and isn't a good thing, considering the strong history of alcoholism in my family.

I am not applying to any graduate schools in states that don't allow medical marijuana. And I hope, if any of you other ents get to feeling low, anxious, and miserable like I've been and will be for the next few months, you will read this and remember: trees can help. I'm sure, for some of you, it won't, but for me, it is the best thing out there.

Toke one up for those who haven't yet discovered this magical plant. Not even for me, for that would be selfish. I hope that, one day, no one will have to cover up their bodies to hide from the embarrassment of self-inflicted injuries. No one will turn to the blade because they will have the herb instead.  </TEXT>

Unless you went to a school with abstinence only sex education or (like me) none at all. Enough girls in my high school got pregnant that you'd think they'd put two and two together.

<TEXT> I used to be like that. I hated being on top because I didn't know what I was doing. I either sat on the guy's dick or was folded over on top of him; either way, he was still doing most of the work.

Now being on top is second only to doggy. I do a lot of moving my hips by moving my body (former swimmer, it's a lot like the dolphin kick without the legs) and what are actually very similar to a man's thrusts, but with more emphasis on the back swing (if we're facing each other). I recently had some amazing sex on top doing this, I was able to be fucked as hard as I wanted without having to ask him to go harder.

As mentioned before, though, you are still a good lay if you keep doing what you're doing. If you want to do more, try adjusting the angle of your hips in missionary. To build up strength, try dancing around when you're alone. Focus on moving your hips in a circle while keeping your top half relatively still. It's a good ab workout, which never hurts anyway. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I've been seeing this guy for a couple weeks now, but we haven't gone on any real dates. We met and hit it off really well, but didn't really hang out. Then, three Fridays ago, he happens to be part of the crew I'm leading to a party (we're in college in my hometown, so everyone relies on me to know where places are) and I just sort of decide to make moves on him. We leave the party to get smokes and he decides to bum to me for the night. We leave with his roommate to go to another party, then we end up very drunkenly wandering around campus. I end up going back to his dorm and we have sex. Next day he comes over to my dorm, we cuddle under a blanket for hours and then he spends the night. We hung out nearly every day, sometimes spending the night. A week after that first night, he invites me over to his friend from home's house and he has his arm around me for most of the night as a lot of other people from his hometown come over. I went over there again last night with his roommate and got way too drunk and the guy ended up having to take care of me, which I hate. I apologize and he says it isn't a big deal and happens to everyone.

What's bothering me is that we haven't had the 'are we dating' conversation because I don't want to rush it, nor do I really even know what I want. However, multiple people have either asked me if we're dating, or congratulated me on my new 'relationship.' I'm very confused, because I don't think what we've been doing is dating, but other people seem to think so. Are we dating? We haven't gone out anywhere together, there's just an obvious mutual interest.

Tl; dr, I've been hanging out and having sex with this guy I'm into, but I don't think we're dating, despite what other people say. Are we? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It may not be great. It may hurt a bit. My first time was great, didn't hurt at all, and generally awesome, but that seems to be unusual. I fell into the 'we had sex, now I'm in love with you' trap, although that may be because I had known the guy since childhood. 

As for getting handsy, follow his lead. Start off with a hand in his hair and one on his neck. Slide one down his chest or his back. I like to lightly massage his shoulders. Then grab his hips, pull him in closer. If he touches any part of you, it's fair game to touch the same parts of him. I really like to rub all around his cock, but not touch him until he starts rubbing in between my legs. If he's not hard enough for you to feel it through his pants by then, don't worry. He'll get there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This week I fucked a guy I've had my eye on for a while now. We went to a party with a bunch of friends, then decided to leave for another one. We were pretty drunk by the time we left the second party, and then had to make the trek across campus. We held hands and stopped on several benches just to cuddle and look at the stars. We got back to his dorm and sat listening to Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here (one of my all-time favorite albums) while making out. Things got hot and heavy and I ended up spending the night. Next day he and his roommate come to my dorm just because and we ended up sitting cuddled under a blanket outside for hours and hours. Then he came to my room, we laid in bed and watched tv for a while before fucking. He spent the night and most of the day. 

Seems less like a sexual achievement, but I have been afraid to let myself just be intimate without having sex since I got out of my first LTR. I've had hook ups, and a short fling (I had to break it off because I started to have feelings that we both knew would never be reciprocated), but I feel so comfortable with this kid. I'm just going to let it keep happening and see where it goes, but I really think I could let myself get feelings for him without it being unrequited. 

Also, he helped me with my insecurities about my oral skills -- he had to stop me multiple times because I was "just too good at it." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I also am diagnosed with GAD, and I have tripped a few times. I dropped acid the first time three days after a massive panic attack, and it went fine. It may help you to write on yourself. I have seen people put "don't panic," "it's just the drug," or "enjoy yourself" on their arms. That can really help, because, if you get lost in your own head, you can look down and see the words. 

As has been said already, don't let yourself be alone. It is good to have a sober person with you, so that you have someone who knows to watch out for you. I think LSD and other psychedelics have helped me figure things out, including the sources of my anxiety.

I hope it turns out well for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This! 
And boys, if you didn't know why they put that warning on the stuff, its because, when you have a boner, the blood is trapped in there until you soften up. While the blood is trapped, it can't bring fresh oxygen to the cells in the penis. After four hours, a lot of those cells will have died. After long enough, the entire penis will die and, ultimately, fall off.
