<TEXT> She has a very out dated macbook '09 era. I've been looking at new ones for her and I'm confused as to why a: the new macbook pro's have dual core processors and b: why is the processing power around 1.2ghz? What sort of windows laptop would be comparable? Since she is required to have a mac, what ( in your opinion ) would pose the best value?
Thanks, and many apologies for posting in the master race. You guys would have a much greater knowledge than that of other subs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I work in at a dueling piano bar and I usually miss everything that happens there. But on this night I got to see two sets of tits. One from a girl who wanted free drinks from me (she didn't get it this isn't r/gonewild ) and the other because some dude convinced her that it was a good idea to show the bartenders her boobs before they take a shot as some sort of "good luck" act. Either both were nice and made my night! </TEXT>
