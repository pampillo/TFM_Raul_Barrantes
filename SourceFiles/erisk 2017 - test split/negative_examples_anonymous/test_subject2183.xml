<TEXT> It has been an eternity and i long for the feeling of affection, to care about my meaningless things, be loved or touched by someone but i can't get out. I really start to freak out wondering if i have broken my brain, gone too far. Would my sober life now consist of me being stuck in an asylum. I am now a nutcase and this weird feeling of everything is driving me crazy but there is no escape. I soon come to grips that i am powerless to change these facts, so i might as well make the best of it. Fuck it, this feeling is good and i am good. It is what it is, everything that was and everything that ever will be. I started to feel a nice sense of comfort with this realisation, all my trip buddies are feeling the goodness and are good. I think to myself this is why i like them so much, slowly everything starts to calm down as i begin to pick the pieces up of my sober life. I realise that i am going out later, that it is a saturday; tomorrow will be sunday and so on. time finally exists and I am free to do whatever i want.

I can relate to this so much </TEXT>

<TEXT> I sometimes get so busy and stressed that I spend even an hour just sitting down and thinking in a circular pointless way trying to remember what should be done as if I am always forgetting something. I feel stuck all the time so I resort to just focusing on one thing for example studying for a statistics exam. Eventually I get into a thought loop where my mind wanders and then I forget about something important and I just feel frustrated. This has been happening for 3 years and I have been failing college as well I don't know if this is related. I feel like I have a disorder or somekind but would like some input.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Im 120lbs and I heard that low doses of DMT seem to almost always induce a bad experience and that trippers should go for a breakthrough dose such as 30mg-40mg and that it isn't scary once you are in the experience. I am aware that it is one of the most potent substances and my only experience is with acid and shrooms. I want to test the waters since I don't know what my reaction to DMT will be like.

What is your suggested dosage? to those who are experienced with dmt </TEXT>

<TEXT>  actual antidepressant


These have made me worse. Shrooms is the best anti-depressant in my experience. 


Tripping all the time in an effort to stave off feeling the symptoms of depression would be as counterproductive as any mindless drug habit


It seems to me to be a treatment rather than an addiction since the positive effects lasts for weeks after taking the psilocybin.

If anything; it has a negative effect overall in that I am unable to sleep due to high libido as well as being unable to focus on work or college. My usual routine is pmo once or twice a day but I will keep it at once a day and I will try to cut out porn if I can.

Women are still attracted to me whether I have fapped all day or am on a long nofap streak. I perform the same at college as well. I guess this is good bye to nofap but I will return every now and then to check out how people are doing. 

Good bye :) </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-05-02 15:23:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After a lont time I started to learn a couple of truths about life. Ive been thinking a lot and some important thoughts have been crossing my mind..

Anybody else think that "happiness" is overrated? We have a climate problem + we have overpopulation with 7 billion monkeys on the planet. 80% of these 7 billion live in poverty and misery on less than $10 a day. 20% who live out of poverty are overly consumeristic and unhappy. 

I think old ideas of "happiness" dont apply. I think a revolution is going to come soon in the form of either war or natural disaster and it will be about survival more than the petty "american dream".

I think studying 5 years of your life for a degree and then throwing your resume into a pool of other resumes only to find out that either the job sucks or that you can't find a job because of unemployment is a path that too many people are taking.

The last topic I would like to discuss is love. You may find that special someone and spend the best years of your life with them and you will be happy or you may find that your partner is only there to take advantage of you and ruin your life in terms of divorce and child support.


I dont know why I am rambling. I could be completely wrong. But I just wanted to discuss these topics. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Question] Toxic Black smoke </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-01 10:34:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I vaporised some weed in a lightbulb (I had cleaned the inside so there is no toxic coatings etc). I kept on heating it up with a candle just to make sure that all the thc will get out even though it already looked used up.
Some black smoke started coming out with a really bad smell and as I inhaled I felt sick and dizzy and even now (1 week later) I feel like an idiot as if this caused me some brain damage. I feel sick like I could pass out at any moment and I have been like this for 1 week now. That black smoke looked really toxic as if I was breathing in a car exhaust pipe.
Is all damage caused by smoke healed and reversed over time?
I feel like I was heating up and smoking ash and burned sugars :/.
All of this just to make sure that I dont waste thc :( </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Had a strong mushroom trip on 5 grams about 6 months ago.

I feel like we are alone in the universe and that "happiness" only exists so that evolution can do it's dirty work. I feel like everything we do will be returned to dust and will decompose. I feel like everyone I will ever know and love will stop existing and perish. I understand that consciousness is also an illusion so that we can keep on reproducing. Even though we already have 7 billion and a climate problem.

I feel terrified and alone. I have been like this for too long and I am lost.

God doesnt exist and life is meaningless. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Strange heroic acid trip report, </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-19 13:03:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I took about 5 Tabs last week apparently it was very pure stuff. During the peak of the trip I saw a vision of dancing elves with hats around a glowing box. They were dancing around in a circle. I felt as if my whole life and the whole existence of the universe was a movie and inside the box was the ending, the plot twist of the movie. The box suddenly opened and everything suddenly changed and felt different. All the pieces to the puzzle fit in and my heart started racing as if the whole universe existed just so that it could build up and produce this one glorious moment. Like an explosion all this information came out of the box in a state of euphoria for about 5 minutes everything became black this is when the trip went bad and I felt like I was losing my mind. Like I had a taste of the fruit of eden and am now being punished. Like curiousity killed the cat. After the trip it was hard to remember it in detail and only now am I piecing it together. Im fine now and im over the bad part of the trip. 

The room with the dancing elves was a bit like glowball which is a game on android.

I felt so happy and I felt so deeply connected and grateful to the universe for my life. I feel motivated to find someone special and spend my the best years of my life with them. Talk to that girl. Why? Because when you are together 40 years in the future she will wish more than anything that your relationship has gone this way. None of this bullshit negativity and depression.

You take the psychedelic and you know the effects will take place in an hour. You sit in the beach and the water starts to recede, you feel the fear and anticipation of what is about to take place. The birds flock away and the wind starts to blow violently. The fear builds and as a result you feel the need to control it so you look around but there are no trees or bars; nothing to hold onto. 

You push your hand through the sand to find something; anything to grab onto but it is useless. The sand runs through your fingers and refuses a grip. You come to accept your fate. The massive wave in the background slowly approaches and you know that you have to face it head on.

 The gigantic being destroys everything in its path. It is both terryfying but it has its own majesty and beauty. As it moves on everything calms down and you have a new understanding; you feel refreshed and clear headed. Novelty has washed on the beach and a lot of filth was destroyed in the process. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-12-03 13:03:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As you know the structures are almost identical except for the one hydroxyl group.

DMT:

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/DMT.svg

Psilocin:

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Psilocin.svg

So would they bind to the same receptors? I know that there is a big difference between mushrooms and LSD as the latter is known for binding to dopamine receptors such as D5 and D2. While mushrooms are focused mainly on the serotonin receptors exclusively.

How do mushrooms play a role with the pineal gland?

Does DMT have the same binding affinities as the Psilocin in mushrooms?

If it does indeed bind to almost all the same receptors; both experiences should be theoretically similar. </TEXT>

<TEXT> After taking mushrooms and acid several times; I feel like the majority of the human race are brainwashed and is on autopilot. I feel like not many people are doing things in an intelligent geniuine way and that most are following any impulse they come across. 

I have no interest in hanging out with my current friends, watching tv, or any tv shows, video games, youtube etc. Eating trashy foods. (This is a good thing). Right now I would prefer a relationship with someone I am deeply in love with and a mostly solitary life where I work and get my degree and explore what else life has to offer.

I am not really into conspiracy theories but I think about had a message that was on point. Also talks from speakers such as Terrence Mckenna. The whole idea about primal individual freedom and abandoning systems and culture.

<TEXT> I think the movie fight club was right I watched it back around when it came out, this lifestyle of working 9-5 or studying perpetually for exams is disastrous for human happiness. Given our origins of hunter gatherer culture and moments that required us to act quick with adrenaline pumping and "life or death" doesn't happen anymore. It's repetitive work for almost everyone whether you are in a job or still studying.

I participated in this lifestyle feeling unsatisfied and I even blamed myself saying that I was too lazy. But every day I sit down and pour hours and effort into studies I feel myself dying down to a sort of conformist lobotomized state. Tragically the day where there was a shooting nearby and police everywhere was the only moment I felt alive and aware because at least it's not the same old boring shit regardless of if it's threatening to my life or not. Something like a mastermind theif or a heist planner seems more exciting and alive.


Or if things erupt into anarchy I wouldn't mind either i'm sick of the top 1% being what they are who aren't even happy or if they look happy are chronically delusional. You might not understand what I am saying but to those who do you can definitely relate. I somewhat believe in the anarchic unabomber manifesto.

<TEXT> Being intelligent is a good indicator that they are interesting as a rule of thumb but primarily a girl that is on my level, she is not pretending to be out of my league or not submissive, i can't stand it when they are submissive, but a girl that is close, a girl that challenges me and makes me persevere through obstacles in life and grow as a person an intelligent girl would pretty much fit that as living a life together would pose the usual challengs ofcourse.

A person, when face to face isn't trying to impress you or control insecurity or isn't trying to act superior to be "hard to get" but is with you because SHE wants to be with YOU and YOU want to be right there with HER that kind of love is genuine love. TO THOSE READING THIS AGAIN MAKE SURE YOU ARE READING IN CONTEXT, DON"T MISTAKE THIS FOR ME BEING PICKY OR AN OVERTHINKER, LIFE GETS BETTER WITH EXPERIENCE AND PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO DO GREAT THINGS WITHOUT KNOWING WHY, WITHOUT PLANNING AND OVER-ANALYSIS THINGS FLOW SO LIVE LIFE AND DON"T SIT THERE THINKING TOO MUCH OR WORRYING TOo MUCH THE KEY IS TO **DO** THINGS  </TEXT>

<TEXT> *If LSD is like being strapped to rocket, learning to meditate is like gently raising a sail. - Sam Harris, Neuroscientist and New York Times best seller*

I can certainly say that after two years of meditation I can reach a state where life feels nice; I feel happy as if I am a complete person and I don't need anything that society or the media tell me I need. It feels like all I need is that state of mind and that my happiness is guaranteed. I am no longer a beta, insecure, half lost sheep.

<TEXT> My opinion from an existential standpoint:

Be warned that what is written below is very colloquial and is poorly focused on the structure that calculating and strictly logical people are used to, I refer not to the link underneath but everything after this sentence.

http://www.philosophybro.com/2010/12/nietzsches-thus-spoke-zarathustra.html[1]

After reading this and spending a lot of time with interpretations of nietzsche and satre as well as reading their well known books the idea hit me like a drop of water on my forehead.

The kind of freedom nietzsche was talking about can be understood by first looking at this statement.

"You **know** what happiness is" that's fucking right, don't consult the internet, or a friend or analyse a successful person and find out what next good decision etc etc. No YOU decide. When leaving behind religion and embracing doubt, embracing science we still don't have the kind of freedom neitzsche had in mind. This is because we doubt ourselves in the same way that we now doubt the religion we discarded, we need to consult science before making a decision as if it's the boss.

You are the fucking boss. "Don't be so egocentric?" Fuck off. You call the shots, you roll the dice, you decide when you are happy, you decide what will make you happy, you are a free spirit and therefore you have the power. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I pretty much answered all

I'll answer all of them here

Hi test_subject2183,
I would be happy to help you analyze your practice in order to modify it so that you will quickly come to experience tangible results. In order to do that I will need you to provide more precise information.
When you started practicing about a year ago exactly what did you do? Did you start with 1 hour per day and what was the step by step process you followed? Did you sit for practice once per day or multiple times?
How did your practice change over the year?
In the last month what has your practice been like?
When and where do you sit for practice? How long are your sessions?
Can you describe the session(s) you did yesterday...precisely how did you practice from the moment you took your seat until the alarm sounded at the end?
Have you had any physical injuries or mental/emotional illness challenges in the last few months? Have you begun taking or stopped taking any drugs/medications in the last few months?

Once per day, I would do it in the morning sometimes and sometimes in the evening. I would do it outside sometimes and sometimes inside the houes but mostly outside. No physical injuries or illnesses recently and no drugs or medication. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My view is that existentialism in proper practice is one great way to not waste your life. You matter but most things in life do not matter such as politics, money, morals, ethics, superiority, the law, good and evil. As you can see it resembles nietzsche's notions. Those things do matter in some sense but not as much as you. The key is to not rationalize anything.
If you have a vision, create it and don't use any excuses such as money because money is a word used to describe freedom in a capitalist society. Isn't it contradictory and ironic when you are enslaved by freedom? We simplify freedom to money and work hard to get it but we are not daring enough to explore unfamiliar territory of what it truly means to be free and create your own values. We justify money by thinking that we worked hard and deserve it therefore there is no more work to be done. But we are all too familiar with the word "money" and the idea of money; in the same way that if we learn useless facts or be active in politics we are making a difference or we are stimulating ourselves intellectually. I'm not saying they are wrong but do not be enslaved by them, do not master them either but be free of them. How to test freedom? Set a goal and go for it, if you get distracted..get back on task and become great beyond weakness. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The feeling function is auxiliary. Many of us carry an emotional weight on our mental health. After years of trying to improve my life I found something that changed my life, it resembles Freud's idea of letting people talk about their life, worries, inconveniences and desperation.

Venting. What we do is we add each other on skype via private messaging me; i'll set up a way to get all the contacts and i'll send them to everyone, we have group conversations where we vent or talk about our cluttered lives. Simple.

When I vented for 1 hour non stop I felt energetic, clear minded, powerful, highly disciplined, happy and most importantly; no longer anxious or in despair but powerful and capable. </TEXT>

"Good morning my name is Mr Balls"

The whole class laughed for 15 minutes non stop while he was standing looking all indifferent, me and a friend kept on laughing and we couldn't breathe.

Next art lesson he was balls gone. Turns out he got fired because someone broke a table in his class.

<TEXT> I don't have a passion for anything I lost interest in most things about the age of 10 (idk what happened to me maybe some event or one of my childhood operations something gone wrong) after losing it at 10; my time became occupied with philosophy and just wasting time mindlessly or on intellectual things like science and math. I know people who have a passion but it seems pointless, one friend is in love with cars but he wastes all of his money and screws himself over, he says that he loves it and enjoys it but it seems like an illusion and completely unjustified another friend is the exact same but with computers

btw how do you think I lost my passion for life and certain fields like math and technology? </TEXT>

I was worried especially for the fact that this resembles a stroke. </TEXT>

Better examples:


Looking at the time 4:30pm, it's like my brain won't recognise that it's 4:30pm and I have to say to myself 4:30, FOOUURR THIRRTYY, hmm four thirty, that's late, , I HAVE TO DO THINGS (OCD feeling when I affirm that statement to myself) I never used to be like this. One very common example, is when negotiating a price, $35, thirtty five, is that a lot of money? is that worth it (more OCD feelings to repeat it until I get what $35 is in terms of it's value. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hope this doesn't get lost in the comments.

God damn this traumatised my childhood. Even one time I had psychosis after a fever in a village. I was having a dream where I was in a place similar to the pit in the dark knight rises. There was a briefcase being opened with millions of dollars. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During this I was experiencing the worst feeling in my life it was truly like hell. I then felt like I was a tiny particle in that massive pit, destined to be there for eternity, unseen, unheard, nobody to save me or find me. (I'm an atheist now but my early christian upbringing might be related to the dream)

___________________________________________________________________________________________
 I went into automatic mode where my mind controlled my actions, I walked downstairs and started screaming, "I'm a stick! I'm a stick" I started banging my body against the wall and I managed to snap out of it. Most uncanny event that had ever occurred to me. Few years later I developed depersonalization and severe anxiety, still haven't got rid of it. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We were on a roadtrip when someone was depressed saying that he wanted to kill himself; my sister pretended to have a panic attack

** Very shallow rapid breathing, when i mean fast, the fastest you can breathe in and out. Over and over for 2 minutes (I know very very unhealthy) he stopped with the suicide talking and she stopped with the fake panic attack**

Now the bad part: she told me that she didn't feel like herself, like she had lost a part of herself when she did that, like a part of her brain had turned off. the brig problem is that i've heard of people getting perm brain damage because of breathing such as this (especially 2 minutes of that rapid breathing)

it was similar to this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SQFoyRfQGc

but instead of filling the lungs she only allowed minimal amount of air in and out very rapidly over and over for 2 minutes

what are the possible effects in the long term?

what happens to someone when they do this for 2 minutes 5,8,10 etc </TEXT>

<TEXT> For years I was raised a christian, told about how heaven awaits. Neuroplastisity is my guess as to why the feeling of death is still exciting and is something i'm looking forward to after life. I know logically now that after death the chances are it's non-existence but as a habit the idea of heaven waiting for me as a reward is still there. It's sad really because of this I feel like I can't value life. Only sometimes do I intuitively understand; yes after this it's non existence ,very tragic; live your life to the fullest!. I wish those moments occurred more often. The idea of heaven or some sort of excitement for the mystery of post life won't get out of my head! :( :/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> Once me and a friend saw a ball of flies consisting of around 4 flies; rolling around very fast, about the speed of a bowling ball. This was at school.

Several other occasions i've encountered strange things like someone throwing a pen across the classroom and it lands in someones pocket.

I used to have a tennis ball and whenever i would get lost somehow we would re-unite over and over again. (very strange reminds me of quantum entanglement or something)

I had a paper aeroplane that I threw off a balcony and it turned around and went somewhere on the hotel roof. I said to my sister "It will return to me just like my tennis ball watch"
Few minutes latter we wear a 'tang' and the plane is in the barbeque that was on the balcony.

other things: rolling a die with the same number, getting strange streaks in probability games like tactics arena I had a 1% chance of hitting an enemy that would make the difference between winning and losing, I decided to take the shot and I got it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Instead of sitting down and doing nothing, so far I've come up with:

1. Learning C++ and C#, or reading a well known philosophy book; these have to be done in the most efficient way possible.

2. Focus on doing those activities. When ever distractions arise; I make a conscious effort to focus again. This will train my brain to have discipline and endurance to focus via neuroplasticity; instead of being an ADD multi-tasker.

I still fail to convince myself why those are worth my time. I think time is one of the most valuable assets we have. </TEXT>

<TEXT> At the start of this 53 day streak I covered my glans with saran wrap. 

This was done because it's a method of restoring sensitivity and dekeratinization in circumcised guys. I have a small slit to urinate and I take it all off at night.


This 53 day streak is my first streak over 7 days and I have a feeling that the saran wrap may be a contributing factor. I fear that the saran wrap could be a negative contributing factor to me getting such a high streak because I don't feel "super powers". I've been flat lining the whole time as well, no urges at all. In my previous streaks that were around 5 days each I felt a lot of superpowers, exactly the same as the ones others would write testimonies about.

What are your thoughts and what do you guys think of the science behind my predicament? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was trying to deposit from special savings account 1 into term deposit 2 because of a slightly better rate.
Special savings accounts give you a ton of more interest if you make one deposit and no withdrawals for that month. (it's a condition for those types of accounts)

------------------------------------

 I spent days doing the math trying to figure out if I would lose more or gain more if I transferred money from the special account to the term deposit since the rate is higher on the term deposit but you violate the special account rule where you can't make a withdrawal for the month.


-----------------

Today I spent ages talking with an employee, we finally did the complex maths and I was about to come to my decision of transferring it at the expense of about $200 worth of extra interest (I would lose $200 very bad idea) because of violating the withdrawal rule. 
Suddenly clarity in my mind.

--------------------------------------

If I transfer money from special account 1 to my term deposit I will not get extra interest on special account 1 for that month.

I can transfer all of the remaining money from special account 1 to special account 2 which will then give me extra interest for that month thus saving my ass from flushing $200 down the toilet.

-------------------------------------

A simple solution to such a complex situation. I got relief and fear at the same time thinking "what if that never occurred to me?"I got to make sure this happens more often. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Then it cried out of me; "Bite! Bite its head off! Bite!" Thus it cried out of me  my dread, my hatred, my nausea, my pity, all that is good and wicked in me cried out of me with a single cry. 

The shepherd, however, bit as my cry counseled him; he bit with a good bite. Far away he spewed the head of the snake  and he jumped up. No longer shepherd. no longer human  one changed, radiant,

 * *** laughing! Never yet on earth has a human being laughed as he laughed! O my brothers, I heard a laughter that was no human laughter; and now a thirst gnaws at me, a longing that never grows still. My longing for this laughter gnaws at me; oh, how do I bear to go on living! And how could I bear to die now!***

<TEXT> [Serious]
For me in the long term I wish I knew the mechanisms of neuroscience, and how a repeating habit makes you more familiar and able. How many tasks numb your pleasure receptors and how pleasurable things are bad for us most of the time, while difficult unpleasant things are good for us. If i knew this I would have stopped the tasty food, the comfort, the gaming, the sexual videos etc.

In the short term I wish I knew about kegel exercises they provide much more freedom and many health benefits.

<TEXT>  Except that none of those are requirements except in that you want them.
 You can starve to death, dehydrate, or freeze. You choose not to, because those things suck. But that does not make it anything less than a choice both in that moment and in the aggregate.
 You don't have to have a job, you want one because the alternatives suck. You don't have to take this particular job, or keep it even when you dislike it, your alternatives just suck.
 But trying to morph the fact that you don't like your choices into something meaning "I don't have a choice" is bullshit. You always have a choice.

Looking at the big picture we are slaves to those more powerful than us, to those who are providing our needs in exchange for money which we have to work for. These governments and private corperations have taken the power to produce they have taken the resources they have grown to become huge and take up all the space and by "space" I mean power distribution, the lower you are in the socio economic spectrum the more enslaved you are because to get your needs you need to be a slave to those above you. To sum it up, the governments and ruling class have taken the power and the resources and will give you some in exchange for your own enslavement. Sure you can make your own home and grow your own food  (Although very difficult) but keep in mind that they have the power and are in control, they c

Think of this analogy, organism blue is in a room with resources, organism blue takes the resources and hides them, organism blue learns to mass produce resources and keeps them all too himself, Organism blue has an offspring and dies. The offspring now inherits his resources and power to create. Organism orange is introduced to the room, organism blue proposes to orange that he will give him resources to live and also the hope of maybe one day inheriting this power and great amount of resources in exchange for orange helping blue mass produce and grow more powerful so it's orange's survival and a bit of liberty for his time effort, keep in mind "survival". Now compare this to slavery, a slave is told "help us or we'll leave you to die here in the desert." My alternative is a society where everyone contributes, and there doesn't have to be a ruling class or if there is at least not corrupt and not in all control, this way we can all contribute and we can still make scientific breakthroughs, space exploration, etc it seems much better to the current state of capitalism.

Addressing specifically what you said: you can say the same thing to a slave and try to convince him he is free, try it, say it in your head to one of those african slaves in the US in the 1800's he can starve to death, but he chooses not to because the masters give him the tiny liberty of choosing not to, he doesn't want to be a slave but his alternatives suck as well, therefore we have some choice but it doesn't change the fact that capitalism is slavery like I originally stated you are stating anything that can change my view in a valid way.

The key: If a slave is given some choice it does not necessarily mean that he is not a slave

<TEXT> I've been getting urinary tract infection like symptoms

- pain when urinating quickly (I suspect it's from old dried up semen)
the first drop causes a sharp pain inside the penis, if i urinate quickly it hurts more and will sting for a long time, if I go slowly it only hurts a little

- after urination I will have a burning sensation and after ejaculation i would have a very dry drained feeling inside the penis area, maybe inside the tube it feels very uncomfortable,

- after urination I will feel like I still need to pee, and drops of urine will come out one by one slowly for up to 10 minutes or even more sometimes even 45 minutes

- streams would sometimes be bulky and go all over the place, like a spray or double stream I would also have slow streams a lot

i'm 18 years old and a male from australia, seen several doctors which done urine and blood tests, nothing showed up, saw a urologist even got an ultrasound of internal organs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was feeling a bit horny and needed to replace the saran wrap on my glans (restoring sensitivity for circumcised guys) when i felt a little "pop". A drop of liquid went out of my penis and i felt a mini orgasm. I started to get warm and for the next 30 seconds my heart started beating fast, my breathing got faster and it felt like i was having a mini orgasm for 20 seconds. Followed by a built up in release, i then orgasmed and ejaculated. Fucking hell 31 day streak i feel like crying and crawling up into a hole. I had plans and this was the perfect moment of my life to be successful at nofap. I know it doesn't count as a reset but personally i think i lose "super powers" after an orgasm

I can't describe what emotions I am feeling now but damn my life is truly a disappointing one </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mostly paleo, cutting back on carbohydrates big time, focusing on calorie restriction and eating less in general




-
[Much like this](http://documentaryheaven.com/eat-fast-and-live-longer/)


-
exercise is moderate cardio (3 days a week) with a lot of walking and standing (standing desk) very little sitting

-

some moderate weight exercises 3 days a week

coffee and red wine occasionally
hopefully moderate socializing
walking in  nature 

**My big concern is the reduction of carbohydrates, calories and eating in general**

i've been covering my junk with saran wrap to restore sensitivity in the glans because of circumcision, you think blocking of the meatus could make someone unintentionally successful at nofap because it is blocking the path of least resistance, the person wouldn't have to overcome and grow over their urges either so that might be bad? </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the past when I made it to day 10 I felt what everyone described, the superpowers, the energy, the feeling of being awake and alive.


Reached 31 days today and don't feel different at all. I think I found the problem. I have made myself completely asexual. My mind seems to believe that I have gone asexual rather than quitting masturbation or porn, today when I thought about fapping an intuition came from my mind like fapping is a "Disease" I maybe accidentally oppressed myself or it could possibly be some sort of flat line. from day 7-31 it has been effortless I didn't really have to try.


 I'm not really leaving the option of sexual activities with women open to myself because I feel like some or whatever superpowers I have will go away if I ejaculate or orgasm.


 I don't know what I am doing wrong, my past streaks that used to make it to 10 days each on average would make life a 10/10 but this streak of 31 has taken my life from the usual 3/10 to a 3.2/10 </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Buddhism is just another form of escapism

I've been reading a lot of nietzsche and nietzsche seems to be focused on the life affirming, endure through suffering type lifestyle while buddhism seems like an unconvincing idea of escapism, quick fixes, harmony or bliss.

Some would argue and say that buddhism is about wisdom and a peace mind, a peace mind will lead to better coping with life but i doubt that a peace mind is exclusive to buddhism i think learning to live with life as it is much like how nietzsche describes will leave you better off in the long run. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He seems to be focused on escaping reality and living in some type of artificial bliss. I would say an opposite perspective would be that of Nietzsche, a life affirming idea where people acknowledge the reality they life in no matter how unpleasant and try to live with it, try to adapt to it and overcome it, rather than escaping with your meditation, your lsd or ecstacy or even your quick fixes like instant bliss. One should get up off their ass take life by the fucking neck and be the master and not the slave. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I don't think they could have invaded the west coast. Midway would not have been the first big battle, Hawaii would have. From there it would have gone on much as it did, but at a later date. Lets say everything was delayed by a year, that we had not reduced them as much to ruins by the time the atomic bomb came into play. We had Tinian a year before we dropped the bomb- they would have been dropped on Japan on the same day as it already happened, and the war would have soon ended.
It may be that this would have drawn more of our resources from the European theater, in which case the Soviets would have ended up with more of Europe at the end. They could have beat Germany by themselves, assuming that lend-lease went on the same in the new history. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 
You: ok if you have a boner and you feel horny a few things you can do to help yourself have self control

You: make sure you are not hungry tired moody or thirsty

You: so hydrate yourself

You: use muscles a bit so that the blood goes from your penis elsewhere

You: a horny flaccid penis doesn't do much

You: and finally will power, consciously one can control everything they do, they just rationalize actions and some of them become automatic, so focus and try and control yourself, a burning monk during a protest didn't move a muscle or make a sound that's how much self control he had

You: so just remember your prefrontal cortex makes the decisions

You: the limbic system gives suggestions

You: you got anything to add to that plan?

You: how do you deal with those situations

You: rather than waiting it out specifically how do you take conscious control?

You: in detail

Stranger: well usually when I get erect I try to focus on other things or preoccupy myself, or if I start stroking my penis I'll force myself to put my hands at my sides. Also sometimes if I'm very horny and can't help it I'll play with my testicles, but not orgasm.

You: i try to re-wire my neurons, so if I am horny I would intuitively tell myself find a girl then

You: so eventually if you get really horny you will be good with women because you are so hungry for it

You: so every time you get horny ask, "how can I plan things so that I can increase my chances of finding women?

You: and if you happen to be around them and you are not feeling horny then you can say to yourself again intuitively -you had a chance-



You: the body will eventually re-wire itself to the real stuff

You: that goes for fetishes as well treat fetishes as you would treat horny urges

Stranger: good idea!

Stranger: it's just tough because I have a big cock too </TEXT>

Have sex

Ejaculate with orgasm

Loop

<TEXT> My attempt is to try low stimulation activities, these include staring at a wall and doing nothing, walking while doing nothing or reading a book like nietzsche, our lives are full of overly stimulating activities like music, movies, games, porn the idea is to challenge the brain to live with normal to low stimulation, the brain should get "hungry" for stimulation and also your creative side will wake up even more. The mechanics for one activity goes:

Walk

thought enters head

time is precious, is this thought even worth thinking about, this thought is probably a rationalization or weakness is it?

next thought comes in "an urge to play a game", is there a good reason to play that game? no

another thought "is this worth precious human seconds?" probably not

eventually the boredom will fuel the brain for neuroplasticity and creativity for self improvement

<TITLE> How to improve your brain </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-12-11 11:37:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My attempt is to try low stimulation activities, these include staring at a wall and doing nothing, walking while doing nothing or reading a book like nietzsche, our lives are full of overly stimulating activities like music, movies, games, porn the idea is to challenge the brain to live with normal to low stimulation, the brain should get "hungry" for stimulation and also your creative side will wake up even more. The mechanics for one activity goes:

Walk

 thought enters head

time is precious, is this thought even worth thinking about, this thought is probably a rationalization or weakness is it?

 next thought comes in "an urge to play a game", is there a good reason to play that game? no

 another thought "is this worth precious human seconds?" probably not

eventually the boredom will fuel the brain for neuroplasticity and creativity for self improvement

thoughts guys? </TEXT>

<TEXT> An idea nietzsche put out there that clears this up. Many complex systems such as addiction as well as life can not be summed up into steps or rules we need to think for ourselves and deal with our problems as each situation is unique. This is why he despised the stoics while they said "just be perseverant" you can't sum up life to that one statement but I agree with everything else. </TEXT>

I watched a porn video yesterday that was a porn vid that I saw a few years ago when i was 13 and it was saved on a hard drive, I had a very strong OCD type urge today to find her and then re watch the vid so that "the penis can pound the hole hard" was what the obsessive compulsion it wasn't even a sexual desire but an obassessive compulsive one much like some earlier OCD symptoms in my childhood, , also "so that maximum pleasure can be reached for her" I also wanted to know a lot about her like her age and height,

 very strange :( I am failing badly and my life is falling apart </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 
You're now chatting with a random stranger. Say hi!

You both like philosophy.

You: Hello.

Stranger: hi

Stranger: ive noticed people with this philosophy tag type "hello" instead of hi

Stranger: and put a period after it

Stranger: aswell

You: Read Nietzsche?

Stranger: yes i know some

You: Such as?

Stranger: the will to power

You: Yeah i'm interested in ubermench

You: I wake up i try to improve my life, i still scratch my hair and skin, i still pop my joints, i still can't read a 

book and focus, i still get scared and anxious and confused, i still, fap and watch porn, i still eat junk, i still 

distract myself rather than think difficult thoughts, i am trying to re-wire these things but it looks like the 

downward spiral isn't changing course thus making it even harder to quit in the future neuroscience :(

Stranger: ok.

You: any thoughts?

Stranger: what does it mean to "improve your life"

Stranger: ?

You: move beyond your illusion

Stranger: theres your ego

You: self overcome

Stranger: you asked for my thoughts

You: well honestly are you pulling some zen buddism now?

Stranger: no

Stranger: i asked a simple question

Stranger: i dont see the relation

You: my answer is the paragraph above

Stranger: are you telling me you can not respond logically to a challenge?

You: you can deduce what it means to improve

Stranger: no i wont

Stranger: because you cant

Stranger: i have no interest

Stranger: because you are now below me

Stranger: and you have proven it

You: how so...

You: now you are being an elitist

Stranger: you want to express your bullshit delusional ideas but cant defend them with a logic structure

Stranger: no im not an elitist

Stranger: im sorry your ego is hurt

Stranger: it wasnt a complex question that went off on a tangent

Stranger: it was rather simple and challenged the base.

Stranger: the base should be strong

You: Self improvement is have control over one's self

Stranger: no it isnt

Stranger: that is your subjective interpretation of it

You: Training yourself to have conscious control when second nature insists otherwise

Stranger: so you are implying there is duality

You: No

Stranger: how can you not be in "conscious control"

Stranger: how could you know consciousness beyond your human consciousness

You: Just conflicting actions with desires

Stranger: are you implying that actions arent a product of desires/

Stranger: that duality exists between them

You: No

You: ...

Stranger: so then back it up

Stranger: use logic.

You: I'm using reasoning

You: and critical thinking

Stranger: no you arent.

Stranger: you arent challenging my points

You: Your points are not pertinent

Stranger: they are absolutely related

Stranger: everything ive been saying is a response to you

You: hmm

You: I did respond though

Stranger: i didnt say you didnt

You: I don't need to back up my "no"

Stranger: but you are by saying you dont need to back it up

Stranger: fool

Stranger: basic logic failure

Stranger: again.

Stranger: and again.

Stranger: my points remain uncontested

Stranger: you go off on more tangents now

You: No, you made claims without backing them up.

You: The burden of proof is on you.

Stranger: as in where

Stranger: bring it up

Stranger: where i did

Stranger: burden of proof is on me

Stranger: thats a baseless claim in itself

Stranger: rather than being your opinion

Stranger: but yea where did i make a claim without backing it up

You: You want your points contested.

You: Show me a point.

Stranger: we are having a discussion

Stranger: so you want to switch the topic now..

You: They are questions. In which I replied No.

Stranger: no you went off on a tangent

Stranger: i asked you to back up claims

Stranger: your base was "no"

Stranger: should i leave then?

Stranger: since you cant hold a conversation

You: What claim should I back up

You: You asked me if I was implying anything

You: and I said NO

Stranger: i did more than ask questions

Stranger: i think i added statements as well

Stranger: let me scroll

Stranger: "Self improvement is have control over one's self"

Stranger: that doesnt comply with the linear logic structure of language

Stranger: so back it up

Stranger: x=y

Stranger: is what you said

You: To achieve self improvement self control over one's self is a necessary skill.

Stranger: you just changed the point you made

You: i did

Stranger: so you couldnt back it up

Stranger: i assume

You: Not the first one

You: I re stated it

Stranger: sure i will challenge this one too

Stranger: saying something is "necessary" isnt true outside of your personal truths. "necessity" is an abstract 
subjective idea

You: Sure

You: It is of high importance subjectively

You: Saying that it is not is nihilism.

Stranger: "importance" is also a subjective abstract idea

Stranger: what?

Stranger: nihilism is a paradox...

Stranger: saying life is pointless is a point in itself

Stranger: as where believing life is meaningless is a given meaning in itself

Stranger: correct?

You: No

You: "as where believing life is meaningless is a given meaning in itself"

You: how is that a given meaning in itself?

Stranger: because it follows logic. "saying life is pointless is a point in itself"

Stranger: see the irony?

Stranger: meaning is an abstract subjective idea aswell. by saying it is meaningless

Stranger: you still use meaning

You: There is a regress there. Life is meaningless -- Created meaning --- Meaning that was created becomes 
meaningless. Followed by a halt in changing states as the threshold is exceeded.

Stranger: it is a paradox

Stranger: and meaning that was created becomes meaningless is meaning

Stranger: and it goes on and on

You: Intuitively ergo Life is meaningless.

Stranger: it doesnt mean it isnt it just means it also is meaning

Stranger: its

Stranger: a

Stranger: paradox

You: how old are you?

Stranger: why do you ask the question at this point in the conversation

Stranger: i hope this wont turn to an ad hominem

Stranger: but i mean you are going off on a tangent

You: Being overly analytical can be seen as a form of escapism, using what valuable time you have to escape 
solving real life solutions.

You: You limit your intuition to logic.

Stranger: believing that anyone can be "overly analytical" is a belief in itself

Stranger: so is everything you said

Stranger: there is a loophole in logic

Stranger: and so i challenge language

Stranger: but you hold absolutes with logic

Stranger: believing there is something to escape from is abelief aswell

You: Intuitively you seem trapped here. What's the reason for challenging the fabric here?

Stranger: i would say this pattern is more confrontational

Stranger: I seem trapped, yet you are the one going off on tangents and my last related point was uncontested 
again

You: so?

Stranger: you dont reach a dead end with this logic structure

Stranger: rather a circle

Stranger: that continues

Stranger: so you can argue forever

Stranger: and that is more confrontational than escapist

You: Living lifeoverly analytical

Stranger: i dont even agree with what i type but you dont have the intellect to point out my contradiction of self
You: As a function of time

Stranger: going off on a tangent again

Stranger: more ad hominems

You: How is it an AH?

Stranger: you just stated an opinion again while i maintaing objectivity in the logic structure of language

Stranger: because it is an opinion by logics standards

Stranger: and you are using that logic structure to communicate

You: ...

Stranger: we can take it more slowly for you.

Stranger: saying "living life is better than being overly analytical"

Stranger: is that an opinion?

Stranger: are the reasons for that belief based on opinions?

Stranger: is it subjective?

Stranger: answer those

Stranger: yes or no questions

You: It's based on intuition that is not limited by the constraints you keep on building.

Stranger: you are implying that i understand what you are trying to say

Stranger: thats an assumption in itself

Stranger: a belief.

Stranger: right?

You: Objectively and evolutionarily the individual is programmed to survive and reproduce, self improvement is 
intuitively superior to over analysis which is escapism in nature.

Stranger: no. that itself is a belief

Stranger: you are holding things to be absolute

Stranger: can you not see that what you are saying is subjective?

You: Your beliefs that beliefs are to be negated is an assumption in itself

Stranger: who said they are to be negated

You: now you are being paradoxical

You: you refute "beliefs"

Stranger: no

You: you haven't backed up why those are "absolutes"


Stranger: i just point out they are beliefs

Stranger: i just said there arent absolutes

Stranger: ..

You: "you are holding things to be absolute"

Stranger: o

Stranger: why do you hold them to be absolute

Stranger: was the question

Stranger: ok

You: I don't what makes you think I do?

Stranger: because by making a statement, you hold it to be definitive by its nature

Stranger: by the logic structure that you participate in called language

Stranger: every statement is a paradox

Stranger: even saying every statement is a paradox is a paradox

Stranger: meaning, if i say nothing is absolute. i am holding "nothing is absolute" as absolute

Stranger: so it doesnt reach a dead end with this logic structure

Stranger: it just loops

You: ok

You: What is the over arching concept here

Stranger: ok

Stranger: how could i communicate it with language.

Stranger: after what i just said

You: Intuition

Stranger: intuition is a product of this logic

You: How?

Stranger: because it is an idea that can be formulated into words

Stranger: its paradoxical

You: how is it a posteriori?

Stranger: im going to use an idea that can be formulated into words to express an idea that cant be formulated 

into words

Stranger: thats what i cant do

Stranger: but i can

Stranger: because i just said it

Stranger: thats why its paradoxical

Stranger: agree? disagree?

Stranger: "thoughts"

You: indifeference

You: indifference

Stranger: if you were indifferent then you wouldnt need to say you were indifferent

Stranger: see how it loops?

You: I'm indifferent about your statement I care about stating it though.

Stranger: right



Stranger: so you arent indifferent

You: I'm indifferent about your statement I care about stating it 

though.



Stranger: after all that you still cant use the intellect



You: What?



Stranger: you defending what you initially said is just as paradoxical



Stranger: and you cant see that


Stranger: or dont want too

Stranger: w/e

You: You are the one that can't use intellect.

Stranger has disconnected.

<TEXT> "I, test_subject2183, accept the challenge of being accountable for the next 90 days to this group of Fapstronauts. I will make it the full 90 days without viewing pornographic materials, faping, edging, or having any form of sexual intercourse with my wife. I am committing to this because I love my wife more than anyone in the world, and I MUST change for her! When I prove to myself that I can endure this 90 day struggle, I will have the ability to stand strong for the rest of my life."
(You can set your own rules for these next 90 days, and briefly summarize why YOU need to change.)
We will kick off this 90 Day Group Accountability on Sunday, November 24th. Anyone who would like to jump on board with us must have this post submitted no later than Saturday the 23rd, so forward this link to all of your friends, and get the word out! I will link "Day one's" thread </TEXT>

Exercise.
Save money.
Plan for your future. Invest in it.
Wrap your tool.
Tell everyone how you feel about them because in your future they will all be dead.
Relax.
Be positive. Choose to be happy.
Surround yourself with positive, caring people that are better than you.
Practice forgiveness and understanding.
Set goals and put your entire being towards them, whatever they may be.
Give everything you do in life 100%, regardless of how you feel about it. Success is a choice you make every day; it is not dependent upon results.
You're not always right. Always assume you could be wrong. If you are, forgive yourself and move on. Don't dwell. Be thankful to those who corrected you. Ego and pride are roadblocks, surpass them.
Your entire life is defined more by what you give to others than what you have or receive, whether you want to admit it or not. Every day practice a habit of giving, even if it's something small like a compliment. You always have something to offer others, even if you don't have time or money.
Remember that you, just like everyone else, have the power to change the world profoundly. You matter. You only have one life. Make it count. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Thoughts on self improvement and nietzsche? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-11-11 11:29:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After fully understanding nietzsche i have discovered just how flawed the society around me and myself are. I found all my delusions, rationalisations, false interests, escapism all of it and it does feel terrible but I am willing to improve myself bit by bit. When exposing the overwhelming amount of flaws my mind kept on switching between giving up with a sense of nihilism (it's all going to end anyway so just live life and let it go) to the will to life and the will to power (Life happens once, be completely honest in every moment) the eternal recurrence started spawning ideas in my head, If I were to repeat this life with the lack of meaning and delusions for eternity how unfulfilling would it be? Though if there were times when I stood up and acted against delusions and become brave and powerful, then a repeating life may be worth it just for the moments of greatness. Where to begin though? When my mind is solving a problem I just ask myself, is this the most important thing I could be thinking about right now? am I spending my days truly improving my life or am I just wasting it because of escapism and more delusions? Is the question "Am i doing/thinking the most important thing in my life?" a question worth asking, is it an important question? what if it is a result of a delusion? There are so many variables that my whole life is making me feel lost and powerless but the will to life still remains </TEXT>

<TEXT> We all know it, one day we will die and then we won't exist forever.


Right now as your eyes read the words I am typing, you exist and if you are honest enough with yourself, the journey to self improvement is the best journey.

**This right here is an opportunity to walk through the desert to see how successful you are at survival in the desert. To test your spirit against the ultimate challenge: owning one's self. How long until your spirit breaks? Probably not long but instil the idea of death properly in your mind, non existence forever is the most powerful source of energy to make the hard decisions in the present moment. Stay powerful and be cautious of emotions, self pity and other forms of weakness. Finally the most important way to travel in this journey is to "pour the water on the ground" as someone else on this forum once said. The water is tempting to drink in the desert but once you realise beyond the self doubt that you are powerful enough to pour the water and continue walking through the desert then you will be on your way to sure success. When you arrive in a situation where you are tempted to just fap or just watch one more video or any types of distractions, you should identify that they are glasses of water that you should pour on the ground and keep fighting in the desert.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, because seeing things in context, the "big picture", is one of the most difficult intellectual challenges. Most lifeforms can't do it. It is our human gift to be able to juxtapose in the mind things that aren't juxtaposed in our environment. Especially intangible things like your own death. Imagining death as a thing and then placing that thing next to other things in the mind is hard work. Keep practicing.

That feeling where something you have been trying to do is placed into words and you finally feel that the meaning of such a task has been increased because someone else commented it </TEXT>

1. felt bored and was getting image like flashes of a girl from my school

2. Started to imagine her in the room getting naked wanted to have sex

3. imagined some of the ex

4. instead of studying i disabled my filters my google chrome extensions so i could google stuff about sex stories, i felt very curious to read about what sex feels like in detail

5. felt the urge to watch a girl getting satisfied vaginally it was like OCD something is seriously wrong here

6. watched porn videos of girls getting satisfied vaginally from the front (this satisfied that ocd like urge)

7. erection with a lot of precum, felt like orgasming but i had a strong urge to also stop it all and go to sleep

8. *you've already come this far close to orgasm + porn might as well orgasm*
that statement always leads me to failure, i don't know if there is some truth to it

9. came
