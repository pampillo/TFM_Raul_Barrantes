<TEXT> Myxobacteria is the most fascinating social bacteria. It [was known] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22511878) they exchange outer membrane lipoproteins to coordinate behaviors, but exchange of lipopolysaccharides to repair each other is even more striking. Myxobacteria produces many useful chemicals including antibiotics. Another proof that getting your hands in the dirt has health benefits.

<TEXT> This study looked at serious infections requiring hospitalization, not something like cold virus that we get over 50 times during lifetime. Besides, another study by [Dean Keith Simonton](http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/faculty_sites/simonton/p175wmain.html) showed that sickly kids might be more likely to become geniuses "We cannot always assume that good goes with good. We dont necessarily have the smart, stable, and fit on one side and the dumb, unstable, and sick on the other.". 

 [This study]http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0124005#sec013)
also says that "The cognitive ability might be directly affected by infections or related immune responses; however, heritable and environmental factors associated with infections might also influence the associations"

"Lower cognitive ability may be a risk factor for acquiring infections," 

"Studies have indicated that immune related genes might be implicated in cognition, and individuals with genetic liability towards a lower general cognitive ability might also be more genetically vulnerable towards infections." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Snakes and crocodiles are very efficient digesters - so we would probably look like them - no need to have teeth as the food can be swallowed whole, heads and jaws adopted to swallow objects bigger than the head, no need to be picky as we would eat nearly anything, then survive for months without food. Our social interactions would be somewhat different too, as we do use eating as a way to socialize. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The article recommends to take walk breaks, that's all. The frequency of these breaks depends on the individual. Some are better in listening to their body than others and don't need such advice, but others might benefit from it. 

Edit: Is there a better way to redirect posts instead of punishing the poster? As I understand, Reddit takes away rights to post anything new or repost after a post was downvoted, so I can't repost it. 

Also, if you read the comments to this article, some "real runners" did find it interesting - "My own experience of running competitively (25+ years) bears out the evidence in Hottenrott's study.  The walk breaks enable you to change your movement pattern, refuel/hydrate, and reset your thinking." </TEXT>
