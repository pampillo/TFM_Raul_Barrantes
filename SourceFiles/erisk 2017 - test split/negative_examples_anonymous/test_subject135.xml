You've been together since you were 15, so unless your intention is to stay together forever, get out now so that you can explore your inner self, your wants and your needs by yourself while you're still young. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Recommendation: I Am Radar by Reif Larson </TITLE>

<TEXT> It's not without its flaws and you have to push past the first 85 pages to get to the meat of the story, but this seems like the kind of book many Redditors would like so I decided to recommend it. Larson's first book The Selected Works of T.S. Spivet was better.

Here's a positive review of the book: http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/i-am-radar-by-reif-larsen/2015/04/09/77a75312-d6f5-11e4-ba28-f2a685dc7f89_story.html </TEXT>

Sipple's relatives in Detroit said the publicity shattered the Vietnam veteran, who had a history of hypertension and heart problems that led to a medical discharge from the service. He lived on a disability pension.

<TEXT> I see no evidence in this Wikipedia page of any direct connection between Sipple's decline and being outed. This doesn't remotely say that being outed ruined his life.

Sipple's mental and physical health sharply declined over the years. He drank heavily, gained weight to 300 lb (140 kg), was fitted with a pacemaker, and became paranoid and suicidal. The incident brought him so much attention that, later in life, while drinking, he would express regret towards grabbing Moore's gun. Sipple, who was wounded in the head in Vietnam, was also diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic according to the coroner's report. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My feeling is that it's a kind of hypercorrection. Like, teachers tell you not to say "me and him," but instead "he and I," so some people have a tendency to say "he and I" even when it's wrong.

In American English we tend to soften words with T's in them: butter become budder, metal becomes medal. So some people are hypercorrecting all T words to into D words even though that's not how Americans typically pronounce those words.

I've heard it in the New York metro area. I don't know if this is a country-wide thing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're right that it amounted to an occupation, but when you use that word, people who don't understand the situation probably imagine it's like Red Dawn -- the commies marching in and taking over because, well, that's what commies do! Or even like the US using WMD as an excuse to march into Iraq and topple its dictator because oil, duh. 

What was missing from moussa's posts is the context of what happened. Lebanon had been involved in a civil war for a while before Israel got involved, not to mention the fact that Syria also was occupying the country. 

It was a very complicated situation and boiling it down to "it's all Israel's fault" is simply untrue and upvoting what he wrote is a demonstration of biased ignorance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 20,000 is not a universally recognized number and the people that were killed were not targeted by anybody, they were just unfortunately there; their deaths are attributable to all the forces that were fighting, not just Israel.

According to American military analyst Richard Gabriel, all factions in the conflicts agree that between 4,000 and 5,000 civilians died during the siege caused by military activity of all sides. He states that most of the observers that were present of the ground and other relevant sources in Lebanon agree that estimates of 8,000 - 10,000 are too high.[91] </TEXT>

<TEXT> From OP's article:

In 2014, some 370 cases of sexual assault on men or boys were reported across Sweden, according to the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention, although experts believe that the actual figure is much higher.

Lumping men and boys together does this topic a great disservice because pedophiles raping and molesting children is a very different thing an adult raping another adult.

"The general perception is that men cannot be raped," Lotti Helstrm, a senior physician at the hospital told Sveriges Radio, adding that male victims can suffer even more than women.
 
"In studies, the health effects are shown to be greater for men, both in terms of physical health and mental health. There is a greater risk of a raped man getting post-traumatic stress disorder," she said, adding that the subject of male rape remained "extremely taboo".
 
Helstrm explained that men were much more likely to be raped by other men than by women and said that the experience could lead to "sexual identity" problems in future.

So for everybody who's upvoting stories about women raping men, yeah, it happens, but most rapes of men (and women) are by men. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A couple of thoughts: 

It could be that you're working so hard at listening that you're not really listening, if you get what I mean. Maybe if you relax a little and don't worry so much about whether you're looking her in the eye every minute and feel like you're participating in the conversation, you might be more likely to remember it.

Another possibility is that when you're talking, you thinking you're just talking, it's not like she's sharing anything specific that you need to know, even though she is. Maybe a good thing for you two to try is this 36-question test. They're meant to be personal questions where you open up about yourself. Maybe if you know specifically "this is what my GF is thinking and feeling," you'll be more likely to remember it.

<TEXT> Regarding the conversation thing, I get what she's saying. If you're just sitting there quietly, it makes her feel like you're not listening and/or like she's delivering a monologue, not having a dialogue. Even if you truly have nothing to contribute you can always make sure to make little comments to show that you're listening ("uh huh," "got it," "interesting," "I see," etc.) or if you make a little more effort, you can ask her follow-up questions on what she's saying.

As for the eating/ansomia, have you explained it to her the way you've explained it to us? If not, explain it again. If necessary, make a list of the places that you eat at and the foods that you eat and simply go to the next place/thing on the list whenever she asks you what or where you want to eat. Or roll a die (mentally) and pick the one that comes up. 

The dog that's not house-trained, that's disgusting, I don't know what to say about it. Talk to someone who knows about dogs.

Have you talked to her about her messiness? Was she single for a long time like yourself and got used to being a mess? If so, you need to talk to her about adjusting herself to the fact that now you're in her life and she almost literally needs to make room for you.

It could be that she is moving too fast, but remember you both are older. I'm sorry you felt you've missed out on things in life but if you've met someone you really like you'd be stupid to dump her in favor of going clubbing and sleeping around instead.

TLDR: You both need to make a little more effort to make this relationship work but if you really like each other it will (hopefully) be worth it. </TEXT>

The term "suffragette" was first used as a term of derision by the journalist Charles E. Hands in the London Daily Mail for activists in the movement for women's suffrage, in particular members of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU).[7] But the objects of the intended ridicule gladly embraced the term saying "suffraGETtes" (hardening the g) implied not only that they wanted the vote, but that they intended to get it as well.[8]

The rapid spread of Hasidism in the second half of the 18th century greatly troubled many traditional rabbis; many saw it as a potentially dangerous enemy.

<TEXT> That has little to do with it. There are areas in NYC that are becoming gentrified and it is pushing people out despite whatever rent control/stabilized apartments they may have for a number of reasons:

- It changes the character of the neighborhood. If enough of your neighbors are now white transplants from Oklahoma and not the folks you've lived with all your life, you're not going to feel comfortable there anymore and you're going to move out. Just like there's white flight, there's black flight.

- People moving in start opening fancier and more expensive stores that push out whatever cheaper stores that were there before which both reduces the number of "normal" stores in the area and makes them more expensive to shop at because the owners can now charge higher rents.

- Greedy landlords who own a lot of buildings in the neighborhood try to get people to move legally (offering them money to leave) or illegally (harassment of various sorts).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Way to misrepresent what the article said.

One of the reasons why some people believe that women are less suitable to become jockeys is that being a jockey requires tremendous arm and core strength  you need muscle in order to stay in control of your horse. Unfortunately, there are still few women who have the skill and body strength needed to race horses at the professional level.

Of course, there are more complex matters to deal with  women also often have to take a break if they become mothers, and the industry waits for absolutely no one. If a rider leaves, they just hire someone else to ride their horses for them. This creates tough competition, which leaves some trainers and owners more reluctant to hire women because of the off-chance that their rider becomes pregnant and unable to race. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The question is, how would your sister and brother-in-law react to other forms of discipline from you aside from yelling? Would they accept your saying to their daughter, "No, we don't hit people" or putting her in a time out? If they would be okay with that, try it. It takes time, but I believe even small amounts of discipline from other relatives can somewhat counteract a lack of discipline at home. 

But if they won't let you discipline their kid, you need to keep your daughter safe and if that means keeping her away from her cousin entirely, that's the way it has to be.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sexism, mostly. For the longest time women were treated like commodities so they've internalized the idea that in order to get money, it's an "acceptable" idea to sell oneself. While men have not been socialized to think that, so for a man to become a prostitute he generally needs to have fallen about as far as possible in society so that no other options are available to him (you see this a lot in books and movies about heroin addicts).

But there's also the reverse sense that women's sexuality has been suppressed for so long that it's still largely considered unacceptable and/or comfortable for a woman to do things like go to a strip club or a hire a prostitute. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just came across an interview with him that was posted two weeks ago, but I hadn't read. Here's what jumped out at me:

And it is a book that requires, like a television series, an audience. This cannot be sustained by grants  which, I've never gotten one. This cannot be sustained by the publisher alone. If the readers don't turn out for it, if the ratings aren't high enough, this will not see a conclusion.

Welp. This certain strengthens my resolve not to keep reading.

I have 10 volumes. But in writing the tenth, I ... understood intimately how to re-write the first. So now I'm going back and  it was literally a page one re-write for Volume 1, and Volume 2 was the same. 

So yeah, this is why you're supposed to finish your first draft then go back and edit. I'd be willing to read an edited version of volume 1.

<TEXT> You don't need a prologue -- you're supposed to just jump right into the story and all these bits of information are supposed to come out as the story progresses. Instead, MZD did the opposite -- gave us a lot of information and no story and no character development either. I didn't feel that I knew Xanther and her family (or any other characters) any better at the end of the book than I did after each of their first appearances. 

I don't know what's going to happen, but the orb chapters in particular made me think of Lost, which was such a let-down in the end that I regretted watching it. I don't want to go through that again. I'm perfectly willing to wait 10 years until it's finished to read it if it ends up being worth it. </TEXT>

 other people do, too
 That's why rent is expensive here; 

Earlier in the thread you were against the suggestion that people should be required to live in the apartments they've bought and here you're claiming that they do, and that's why rent is so high. You're contradicting yourself.

Rent is not high because so many people want to live here. Rent is high because rich people want to invest their money in apartments that they will never (or hardly ever) live in, which increases the number of luxury buildings built and luxury conversions created, thereby decreasing the number of apartments that would otherwise be available for people who actually want to live here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Helen Mirren would beg to differ. 

Anyway, what you're saying isn't true. It's about what people are used to and the inability to accept that just because something is what's currently done, doesn't mean that's the way it *has* to be done.

Before Bridesmaids nobody thought a female-centric comedy would fly. But ever since, they've been making more like it. Not because they're SJW's and they give a damn about women, but because they'll make whatever sells. And surprise, it sells. 

If they made more movies with actresses that were older, nobody would think twice about it and it would make just as much money as it would otherwise. Somebody just has to have the guts to make that movie and prove it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you only read 2-3 books a month, I can't understand why you'd want to major in literature. That's not what I'd call the mark of somebody who's a huge reader. I read 2-3 books a *week* and I didn't want to major in literature. I hope you're planning on changing your major. No sense in suffering through that for four years. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not about the "inconvenience," it's about the principle that United is engaging in deceptive advertising and they need to stop. Just complaining and demanding a refund is unlikely to stop them. A lawsuit (regardless of whether the plaintiffs win or lose) is embarrassingly bad publicity and brings the information to people's attention when they might not have known about it otherwise and might have been taken in. 

Also, what you missed is that it's not one person suing, it's a class action lawsuit. That means that any money won gets divided up among as many people as sign on. If 10,000 people are named as plaintiffs and they win $5 million it means that each person would get significantly less than $500 after taking off lawyers' fees. </TEXT>

As for OP's point, Shakespeare is obviously more difficult for most people than modern plays so naturally it won't be as enjoyable to read.

<TEXT> You can't make such a broad statement based on reviews of one book. You want to talk Japanese literature, Haruki Murakami is America's darling. 

You'll also have to be more specific about what the reviews were complaining about. Could be that it was poorly translated. People said the same thing about Battle Royale so when they reissued it recently, they re-translated it first -- and it still had language problems. They must have cheaped out on paying a translator and editor. </TEXT>

Conservative rabbis have extended the concept of adultery to include a husband cheating on his wife with an unmarried woman (which does not fall under the traditional definition), and are willing to command a husband to offer a divorce to his wife if she wants one, and to dissolve the marriage unilaterally if he refuses (which would not be permitted under traditional Jewish law  only a man can initiate a divorce).

Either you are misremembering what the book said or the book has no idea what it's talking about. Take your pick.

The Nazi persecuted the Jews based on race, not religion. The church played little to no part in the active persecution of Jews.

The Catholic Church mostly stood by in silence during the Holocaust while the Protestant denominations were somewhat opposed to the Nazis -- out of self-interest. They were against Nazi control of churches; they didn't care about the Jews.

I'm not sure how it got to the state that it's in today, but conceptually Chassidut has a lot to offer, which is why you find a lot of people who become religious are drawn to the less strict and more spiritual groups like Lubavitch, Breslov and Boston. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But you aren't going to marry any of those people and if you do, you'll be miserable. Any happy long-term relationship requires all four types of connection, among other things.

Most marriages are indeed not happy ones. They are "happy-enough" ones. And the ones that are miserable usually end in divorce. Some guy did a huge marriage survey and did an AMA on it a little while back. He said that the only happy marriages were between two completely psychologically healthy people. And since most of us aren't completely psychologically healthy, neither are our relationships. </TEXT>

Yes, for old or sick people, e-reading can be helpful, but most people are not old or sick. 

Among young/healthy people you're just as likely to find people who say that reading on a tablet or phone is difficult for them because they keep getting distracted as much as you'll find people who say that they've suddenly started reading more because of them.

And if you want to say that easily distracted people should get dedicated e-readers, we get right back to my original point, that now having a tablet and phone and e-reader generates a lot more waste than books.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In this fast-changing world where the components of a tablet or a smartphone are about the worst pollution there is, as compared to trees which are renewable and paper which is recyclable, do you think it's immoral or selfish for an author or a publishing house to create ebooks when there is old technology that can allow anyone to read without destroying the environment?

Studies have shown that you must keep your e-device for 3+ years for there to be any benefit to the environment over paper books. If you replace your device in fewer years than that, paper wins every time. On average, people replace their device every 2 years. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It feels really awkward to call someone for no reason, mostly because I can't stop thinking that the other person has better things to do and wants to get off the phone.

You need to trust that your friends want to talk to you. If they don't, then you might want to reconsider whether they're actually your friends or not.

I have friends that I talk to for two hours every week, I have friends I talk to for an hour a month. I chit-chat with my mother for about five minutes at a time multiple times a week sometimes. It entirely depends on what your schedule is, their schedule is, and what you have to say to each other. 

Lately I've found some of my conversations start awkwardly, like we're both being polite about letting the other person go first. I need to start being more assertive because one of my friends tends to monopolize the conversation if I let her go first.

The conversations end when it's time to go to bed or it's time to go do something such as putting the kids to bed or taking the cake out of the oven or switching over the laundry from the washing machine to the dryer. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I feel like I'm unable to multitask while holding a phone to my ear.

1. Don't multitask. If you're sitting in a restaurant with your friend you might both be eating, but you're not doing the laundry or walking the dog or sending out resumes. There's no reason why you should be multitasking just because you're sitting at home.

2. If you simply must multitask, get some kind of hands-free device or put the call on speakerphone. </TEXT>

This kind of conspiracy theory that OP is talking about really only goes back to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, which was first published in 1903. Previous to that, the sort of conspiracy theories about Jews was that they were poisoning wells and using the blood of Christian children in their matzah, not that they were taking over the world.  </TEXT>

Whether a particular type of bird flies south for the winter depends mainly on one thing: what type of food it eats.

In areas that have cold winters, some common bird foods, such as nectar and insects, may not be available year-round. Birds that eat those foods must fly south to find food to survive. Other birds that eat seeds or bugs that live under tree bark often hang around, since they can continue to find food all winter long.

<TEXT> If they weren't Orthodox Jews/followers of the Shabbos, this tragedy would not have occurred.

This is false. 

Hot plates are commonly used items. 

They are safe to use.

They are not safe to misuse.

It is not a religious requirement to misuse a hot plate.

The tragedy occurred because of their misuse of the hot plate.

Of course I know what you're trying to say, and you're mistaken. The only way you'd be correct is if hot plates were inherently unsafe and Orthodox Jews insisted on using them anyway. This is clearly not the case. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I reread your post and I just want to make sure we are on the same page: you understand they left the hot plate on on purpose right? In order to avoid using electricity/flicking a switch on their religious holiday.

Which was completely unnecessary. In other words: not a religious requirement. Most people use timers to turn them on and off automatically. There's a guy in this thread who copped to leaving his hot plate on all Sabbath. You can ask him why he thinks it's safe despite the fact that we have proof that it isn't. And if he says "because their hot plate was malfunctioning and mine isn't," then he's clearly just as thoughtless as these people. Nobody knowingly uses a malfunctioning hot plate. In fact, I'm not sure there's anything he could say that wouldn't prove that he's being thoughtless.

Sorry for the idiot comment, it was out of line. it's just such a frustrating situation my emotions got the best of me.

Thanks. </TEXT>

They found the widest gap in entitlement, suggesting that men are more likely than women to exploit others and feel entitled to certain privileges.

The second largest difference was in leadership/authority. "Compared with women, men exhibit more assertiveness and desire for power," Grijalva says.

Most people are craven sheeple and it's not remotely surprising that when somebody in power tells them to jump, they ask how high. It's a lot harder to figure out why some people act truly selflessly, putting themselves at risk in order to help or save others.

<TEXT> Recently finished Whatever by Michel Houellebecq. It had an unnamed narrator, but it was a really short book so it didn't matter. Too bad it wasn't as good as it could have been.

The beginning was an absolutely vicious skewering of office life and office workers. The middle had a touch of American Psycho to it. But then the end just petered out into nothingness. Perhaps that was part of the point, but it had more of the feeling that Houellebecq just didn't know how to sustain the story.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nobody knows. If they did, breast cancer testing wouldn't be as controversial as it is. When they pushed early detection they found more and more cancers but it didn't seem to save a commensurate amount of lives. Why? Because it turns out that a significant number of these cancers would have resolved themselves on their own and had they not been found through testing, nobody would have been the wiser. So instead we save a few more lives, but put a lot of women through hell for nothing.

Problem is, nobody knows once a tumor is found whether it will resolve itself or not so the thinking see-saws between earlier testing and later testing. </TEXT>

I don't know where you got this number or definition from. There's a concept that there are 36 righteous people among the nations in every generation and they "sustain the world." It has nothing to do with helping Jews.

There's another concept that any non-Jew living in (ancient) Israel and was pious was called "righteous among the nations."

And finally, the phrase "Righteous Among the Nations" is what Yad Vashem calls non-Jews who helped Jews during the Holocaust. It's not kabbalistic, it's just a slogan that they appropriated because it sounds good. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really don't understand why you're arguing. I'm sorry this is not something you're familiar with, but this is a matter of safety for yourself, your family and anybody who might be living with you or in your building. It's not something to be defensive about because you've never heard of it.

Do not overload circuits. Never use extension cords or multiple plugs with a space heater, and make sure the unit is not plugged into the same circuit as other electric appliances.

If your space heater is plugged into a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) and the GFCI trips, dont assume there is something wrong with the GFCI. Immediately stop using the 
heater until it can be checked by a professional if not, a serious shock could occur.

http://www.safeelectricity.org/information-center/library-of-articles/51-heating-safety/101-space-heaters

During use, check frequently to determine if the heater plug or cord, wall outlet, or faceplate is HOT! If the plug,
outlet, or faceplate is hot, discontinue use of the heater, and have a qualified electrician check and/or replace the plug or faulty wall outlet(s). If the cord is hot, disconnect the heater, and have it inspected/repaired by an authorized repair person.

 This is not a shoe advertisement. The trick, I'm now convinced, is to just go ahead and do it, whether you feel like it or not. Because you know what? YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO FEEL LIKE IT.

 Pick something you've always wished you could do. 

That's great, but I have a friend who's depressed. There is nothing she's always wished she could do. She literally has no interests aside from reading and watching TV. </TEXT>

I agree with everything you said except for the bit about Hugo Lamb. I didn't find any of it compelling. I basically had to force myself to read it, not because the writing was bad or boring per se but because there was literally no character that was of any interest or any storyline that I cared to find out how it was resolved.

<TEXT> Have you ever been sexually assaulted? Honest question, not being a twat here.

I've been bullied and my biggest "win" came through words. And it took me a long time to get there because for too much of my life I was also given the advice to just ignore bullies. 

People sometimes think they will react in a certain way, and when the time comes, it somehow isn't how it goes.

This isn't a case of being cornered in a dark alley and feeling panicked. The girl had enough presence of mind to speak up the first time, she just needs the lesson reinforced that just because an authority figure says something doesn't mean they're always right and doesn't mean you have to listen.  </TEXT>

After years of snapping up credit cards with ease, the Credit CARD Act of 2009 will make it much more difficult for anyone under the age of 21 to qualify for a credit card.

Under the new law, which takes effect in February 2010, no one under the age of 21 will be approved for a credit card offer unless a parent or guardian or spouse is willing to co-sign, or the young adult shows proof of sufficient income to cover the credit obligation.

<TEXT> For a heterosexual man in prsion, how can homosexual rape be a pleasurable substitution to masturbation?

The same way that sticking your dick in a pie or a fleshlight is. A hole is a hole. It doesn't particularly matter what it's attached to when you're desperate.

If it's to show dominance, what's wrong with just beating the crap out of the guy?

Because men are much more terrified of being raped than being beaten. </TEXT>

To a certain extent, this is an intractable problem. If the two of you stay together, one of you has to change. If he does other things that make you feel loved, then I recommend it be you. Otherwise, it should be him because there's no sense in having a boyfriend who you don't feel loves you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everything that's been said already is correct, but colonel is an exceptionally strange case.

1540s, coronell, from Middle French coronel (16c.), modified by dissimilation from Italian colonnella "commander of a column of soldiers at the head of a regiment," from compagna colonella "little column company," from Latin columna "pillar" (see column). English spelling modified 1580s in learned writing to conform with the Italian form (via translations of Italian military manuals), and pronunciations with "r" and "l" coexisted 17c.-18c., but the earlier pronunciation prevailed. Spanish coronel, from Italian, shows a similar evolution by dissimilation.

<TEXT>  For the religious Jews, their calendar is the right one, and everyone else is observing the wrong holy day.

Not true. Non-Jews have no obligation to observe Saturday or any other day as the Sabbath. If they follow a religion with a different Sabbath day, there's nothing wrong with that. 

Here's how Christianity's Sunday Sabbath developed:

<TEXT> Within the 12% of North Americans who claim left-handedness, there are some interesting demographic variations. As regards gender, men are slightly more likely than women to be left-handed, with most studies indicating that about 13% of men and just under 11% of women are left-handed (men are NOT twice as likely to be left-handed as is sometimes claimed). It has been suggested this occurs because girls are more receptive to social mores and more likely to conform than boys (although there may also be a genetic component).

<TEXT> Fifty Shades of Grey is the only "spin-off" of Twilight that I can think of  that has been especially successful. And it didn't do it by mimicking Twilight the way Charlie Bone mimicked Harry Potter. So no, I didn't respond to the wrong comment. I disagreed that the reason why Charlie Bone wasn't successful and Harry Potter was had anything to do with the series growing as its audience did. </TEXT>

<TEXT> today I read a fact that the mental condition and stress levels of teenagers is close to that of mental patients in the 1950s.

This is a widely misused quote/statistic. It was originally reported in the 1980s, then a meta-analysis was done in 2000 about studies done through 1993. I can't find anything more recent. But even if anxiety has only gone up since 1993, it's part of a continuing trend, not something that is distinctly new about the 21st century.

The only reason why things seem more prevalent than they used to be is because of the Internet and more of a willingness to admit things like depression, especially among boys.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pandora's explanation:

Free Pandora accounts permit 6 skips per hour per station, for up to 24 total skips per day across all stations. The daily skip limit helps us prevent having to pay royalties on songs that are not being heard.

Upgrading to Pandora One increases your 24-hour skip limit, but does not remove the skip limit entirely. You can learn more about Pandora One here.

A skip is considered to be a skipped song, a Thumbs-down rating, or choosing "I'm tired of this track" in the menu of the music player.

Licensing is one of the most expensive aspects of providing the service, and we must pay the full royalties for a song, even if it only plays for a few seconds.

<TEXT> Or Wizard's Hall by Jane Yolen. Interesting that the Books of Magic and Wizard's Hall came out within a year of each other. Clearly this was an idea that was percolating and Rowling caught the bug too, only it took her seven more years to put her book out.

In 1991, the author Jane Yolen released a book called Wizard's Hall, to which the Harry Potter series bears a resemblance. The main protagonist, Henry (also called Thornmallow), is a young boy who joins a magical school for young wizards.[74] At the school "he must fulfill an ancient prophecy and help overthrow a powerful, evil wizard."[75] However, Yolen has stated that "I'm pretty sure she never read my book," attributing similarities to commonly-used fantasy tropes.[76] In an interview with the magazine Newsweek, Yolen said, "I always tell people that if Ms. Rowling would like to cut me a very large check, I would cash it."[77] Yolen stopped reading Harry Potter after the third book, and has expressed dislike for the writing style of Harry Potter, calling it "fantasy fast food".[77][78]

I saw your comment below in the thread and at least where I'm from, boys are much more likely to get their cheeks pinched than girls. It's a different dynamic than you (and possibly) OP is describing.

Each week we focused on a different aspect of writing (e.g., character, plot, description) and we had to read a short story that illustrated this technique, write a little in class and do a homework assignment. Maybe because one week per technique wasn't enough or maybe because I'm not the kind of person who can produce a story on demand, but I felt this was completely unhelpful.

Though I did eventually develop a story idea that has a ton of potential and I've been writing about it ever since, so at least I had that going for me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is completely untrue. Popcorn is actually quite healthy and has tons of nutritional value. It is an excellent snack.

And the facts speak for themselves: a single portion of popcorn contains more antioxidants than all the fruit and veg most people eat in a day, as noted in a study by Scranton University. Antioxidants keep molecules harmful to cells in check, and are present in many fresh fruits and vegetables. Popcorn also has a large amount of vitamins; folate, niacin, riboflavin, thiamine, vitamins B, A, E, and K, as well as being a source of iron, potassium, zinc, and polyphenols which contain the antioxidants to fight off cancers and cardiovascular health problems.

<TEXT> This article is a mess. 

The reason why relationships can't be based on explicit exchange is because hardly anybody can handle the truth about themselves or anybody else. Not too many people are going to be honest about their failings as a friend or partner, and in any event, most people are willing to put up with their loved one's failings even to the extent that they put up with abusers.

But it's also because in every relationship, there's always somebody who loves/gives/does more and somebody who loves/gives/does less because there are no two people who are exactly alike and are in exactly the same circumstances. </TEXT>

Fat doesn't conduct heat well, so while it does insulate your body, it feels colder to the touch. So wherever you have larger fat stores, those parts will feel colder.

<TEXT>  if you have rule out any name associated with a saint, that's a lot of names. 

Yes, that's right. Traditionally Jews gave their children Hebrew names and then at some point they added Yiddish names, which tended to be translations of the Hebrew name. Like Tzipporah-Feigie, which both mean bird. And then when English names came around, they tended to give English translations of the Hebrew names like Rivka-Rebecca. 

I've known Jewish people with Gaelic names and all kinds of European names, so it's odd that Nicholas specifically would be off the table.

Nicholas isn't off the table. Like I said, if you eat ham and cheese, it really doesn't matter that much what you name your kids.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a couple of friends who have Fridays off for different reasons and the way it works is that Thursday night is for shopping and Friday is for preparing for the Sabbath. They never use those times for leisure activities. (One is single and the other is married with children, so you can't even say that it's the fault of their situations. Their situations could not be more different.) 

If I were offered the option of having off on Friday but not Sunday, I would not take the offer.

And for secular people, they'd adjust to having Sunday off instead of Friday pretty easily. Considering that hundreds of millions of people around the world have off on Sunday, it's not like this is some kind of impossible thing to deal with.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since you posted this 18 hours ago, I'm going to assume you're not a Sabbath-observer. As a Sabbath-observer, having Friday off does not make more sense. While it's nice to be able to have the whole day to prepare for the Sabbath, that's exactly the problem. The only thing you can do (especially in the winter) is have time to prepare for the Sabbath. So if you want to go to the beach in the summer or hang out with some friends or go to a concert on Saturday night, you're not going to be able to do that.

Having Sunday off works better regardless of whether you're a Sabbath observer or not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a name that's strongly associated with Christianity. So any Jew who really cares about being Jewish and transmitting the tradition to the next generation would not give their child that name. Anybody who's a ham-and-cheese Jew will do whatever they want.

From the Greek name  (Nikolaos) which meant "victory of the people" from Greek  (nike) "victory" and  (laos) "people". Saint Nicholas was a 4th-century bishop from Anatolia who, according to legend, saved the daughters of a poor man from lives of prostitution. He is the patron saint of children, sailors and merchants, as well as Greece and Russia. He formed the basis for the figure known as Santa Claus (created in the 19th century from Dutch Sinterklaas), the bringer of Christmas presents.

Due to the renown of the saint, this name has been widely used in the Christian world. It has been common in England since the 12th century, though it became a bit less popular after the Protestant Reformation. The name has been borne by five popes and two czars of Russia.

If it's possible that she's not hungry, you might try delaying her feeding time by half an hour or so and see if that makes a difference. 

If she's playing a game, you have to put your foot down and tell her that if she spits out a bite, you can't give her another one. And if she spits it out again, you take her out of her chair, tell her that dinner is over, and you walk away. This should get the message across more than just telling her over and over again that spitting out your food isn't a good game. </TEXT>

Well, not necessarily. It is calories in, calories out, but if you can effectively change the calories out, you don't necessarily have to change the calories in. So while crunches certainly aren't going to do anything, but if a sedentary person starts walking half an hour a day without altering how much they eat, they will lose weight. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree. LOTR is tough reading; ASOIF is easy reading. LOTR is high fantasy, ASOIF is low fantasy as it de-emphasizes the traditional fantasy aspects.

OP: If you don't like LOTR, you probably won't like any other high fantasy books.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not that I doubt that this is true, but how do they compare with religious people of similar ethnic, economic, and regional backgrounds? Not to mention the fact that in some parts of America, it takes a bit of guts to be secular, so it wouldn't at all be surprising that people who don't care about following the crowd aren't sheeple and don't just fall in line with what other people are thinking and doing. That's not about religiousness or secular-ness, but personality.

<TEXT> Sometimes knowing what you want to do is instinctive, but sometimes it's about sitting down and asking yourself what your interests are, how you envision your future life, and what you're willing to do to make that happen.

A lot of people don't really know themselves, didn't pay that much attention in school, haven't gotten much guidance from counselors or teachers or parents, and are frankly unable to imagine that someday they're going to have to pay for their own Internet connection. So when you feel like a perpetual adolescent, there's no real pressure to figure out what you're going to do, especially since sometimes what you're *going* to do isn't necessarily what you *want* to do, but it'll pay the bills better than what you *want* to do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The article is about a woman who lost a baby and six months later she was still grieving and depressed and she thought there was something wrong with her because she hadn't gotten over it yet.

I'm stunned that anybody would think this. From the article:

[Kubler-Ross's] model is still deeply and rigidly embedded in our cultural consciousness and psychological language. It inspires much self-diagnosis and self-criticism among the aggrieved. This is compounded by the often subtle and well-meaning judgment of the surrounding community. A person is to grieve for only so long and with so much intensity.

Really? Do you think this is broadly true? I think that most people know that losing a baby is about one of the most traumatic things a person can experience.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Twilight and Dragon Tattoo were both supposed to be examples of popular bestsellers, and if you think that about Dragon Tattoo, I imagine you don't tend to like any popular bestsellers. If that's not the case, what would you name as a good popular bestseller?

I think either is a good example of a typical bestseller. Twilight is YA and Dragon Tattoo is a translation and honestly, I question whether it would have been published or at least have been as big a seller if the author hadn't died. Good examples? John Sandford, John Grisham, Mary Higgins Clark, Maeve Binchy.

I thought Lisbeth was a believable character, and of a kind that we don't get to see very often: a woman who is ferocious, who fights back for herself even though she has been shat on basically her whole life, who is probably on the autistic spectrum.

I didn't find her believable at all. To me she came across as roboticly strong except when the author needed her to be pathetically weak. And she could not have been on the autism spectrum or she could never have done that undercover thing.

It was wish fulfillment in the sense that Larsson did wish his magazine would get as big as Millenium, but that's a much more interesting wish than "oh I want this 'perfect' creepy stalker vampire boy to like me".

Not that bit, the bit where pretty much every woman finds Blomkvist so completely irresistible.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't like the high/middle/lowbrow framing because it implies that there is some objective scale of taste determined by how smart a book is.

I'm not sure what you mean by smart. The "brows" are pretty well-defined. Low-brow is romance and James Patterson, middle-brow is your typical bestseller, and high-brow is literary. It has little to do with quality or goodness, though 99% of low-brow books are pretty bad, but probably an equal number of middle- and high-brow books are also bad. Just because something is literary, doesn't mean it's any good.

 To me, good taste is more like being able to identify the best in a given genre in as many genres as possible.

That's even more subjective.

good taste is knowing the difference between The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and Twilight

While obviously Dragon Tattoo is better than Twilight, pretty much everything that's ever been published is better than Twilight, so that's not saying much. Good taste is knowing that Dragon Tattoo is overhyped, overlong, sexist, and a Gary Stu wish fulfillment fantasy just as much as Twilight is a wish fulfillment fantasy.  </TEXT>

- The Complete Cosmicomics by Italo Calvino. It started out clever but then it kind of got repetitive and annoying.

As for books I did finish, the worst book I read was The Contortionist's Handbook by Craig Clevenger. Thanks for nothing, Redditors who recommended it. Even though it was a short book (like 200 pages), it was still 180 pages too long. It would have been a good short story. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't like the word "good" in this context. I prefer highbrow, lowbrow and middlebrow because I know people who who likes classics and that's considered good taste, but I don't think they have good taste in books at all -- they just happen to like overly wordy and descriptive writing. In other words, it's just a personal preference, not a recognition of the value of classic literature.

I think I have critical middlebrow taste. I read a lot of popular bestsellers and the like, but I rate most of them as being average and not particularly good either because the story is bland or hackneyed or otherwise uninspired and/or the writing is.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm surprised Gravesend is the most expensive of the southern Brooklyn neighborhoods.

One of the most surprising bits of data was the Syrian orthodox enclave within Gravesend. While Gravesend averages $470/sq.ft., the section between Avenues S and U, averages $2,000 per square foot. Houses sell for $1012M, putting it among the most expensive neighborhoods of the city by median price. (And if one simply averaged the entire neighborhood, this interesting enclave wouldnt be visible. At a time when developers and brokers are creating unnecessary new neighborhood names to promote emerging areas (the cringeworthy ProCro and Bedwick come to mind), this area constitutes such a different market that it actually merits a different name.

Oh. So they cheated, in other words.

I'd like to see all the neighborhoods in a chart. The maps aren't really that helpful. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, waist size is not the gold standard for deciding whether someone is healthy or not. Let's see some blood tests, blood pressure, cholesterol, that sort of thing.

<TEXT> That's correct usage.

You just have to take out the other person's name to see if the sentence still works. "I went to the whorehouse for a good time" versus "Me went to the whorehouse for a good time." 

So take "The restaurant gave John and I a discount" -- "The restaurant gave I a discount." Clearly doesn't work, so it's "The restaurant gave John and me a discount." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wikipedia:

Evidence of dedications is provided back into the Classical antiquity. Besides the wish to express their gratitude towards a certain person, the authors often had also other reasons to dedicate their work to a particular person. Well into the 18th century, it was not usual for publishers to remunerate the authors; authors tended to be paid or remunerated as one element of a patron-client relationship, in which the author-client paid tribute, in the dedication, to his or her patron. A typical writer dedicated their book to a high standing personality -- to Frsts or bishops -- or to a city and tried to gain some money through this practice.[2]

In many cases the petitioner was lucky and received a gift from the patron. In some cases, the writer groveled before the patron and a formal dedication "contained often a very elaborate and submissive affection".[2] In some cases not only the authors tried to get some money, but also the printers tried through dedications to cover a part of their costs.

The dedication is not to be confounded with the handwritten dedication of a single copy: the presentation copy.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedication_%28publishing%29#History

I don't think it's essential at all. There are plenty of books that don't have dedications these days. If anything, I'd say author thank-you's have become longer and more popular, where it seems like the author thanks pretty much every person they've ever met.  </TEXT>

As for the system, it sounds flawed because your girlfriend doesn't sound like she really wants it to be this way.

<TEXT> You actually did something interesting, unlike OP who did next to no analysis. Most of these graphs are largely uninteresting and unhelpful.

I once did a study of the books that I read and found that they fell into three categories: Books of authors I'd read before, books that I added to my to-read list based on information I'd read in magazines or the Internet, and books that I took from the shelf of the library without knowing anything about them in advance. 

I found that I tended to like them in just that order, which lead me to taking books off the shelf much less often since it's much less likely that I'll actually end up liking them. Admittedly it means I might miss something great, but I'm willing to risk it considering my to-read list is around 300 books long. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just regarding the writing, Brandon Sanderson didn't have a good handle on the language of WoT. I felt like he used a lot of anachronisms.

As for the story: There were major character deaths that barely merited more than one sentence. 

There was a 900-page battle with this group of people that barely had a single mention in the past 13 books and really had nothing to do with anything. Why was book a 900-page battle? How about a story? With a plot?

And worst of all, Rand's final win against the Dark One had really no impact whatsoever. I read it like three times and I was like, that's it? The same with the breaking of the seals. It was the opposite of epic.  </TEXT>

Not as bad as the finale of Lost or the last book of Harry Potter or the last few books of the Dark Tower, but definitely one of the worst endings that I've encountered. Lots of other series that I've heard ended badly I've avoided, and this is why even though I read and liked a Game of Thrones, I'm not reading any more books until I find out that the series ends well. **I will not be suckered by a fantasy series ever again.**

The one thing that WoT has left me with is mild PTSD. Every time I see the word "shifted" in any context, I flinch a little.

<TEXT> How exactly do they find the statistic of false rape reports?

Here's a Wiki article that talks about various methods: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_accusation_of_rape

The problem here is that you insist on calling someone who was either proven innocent, or where the case was dropped due to insufficient evidence, a rapist.

Well, as I said before, rape is a difficult crime to prosecute in many cases and it is very rare for a person is shown to be factually innocent, so it is safe to say that the vast majority of cases where a man or woman claims to have been raped, it is most likely to be factually true.

As more and more people are educated about the availability of rape kits and dna tests

Except the problem is that more and more rapists are using condoms in order to avoid DNA tests.

Honestly, I don't know what can be done about all this. I don't like anything people are saying these days about rape prevention. None of it seems remotely helpful. But I'll be damned if I can think of anything better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, you're telling me that of the 46 that are reported and only 12 are arrested, that the other 34 as well as the 54 that were not reported are definitely rapists?

As I just posted in another thread, the incidence of false rape reports is considered to be from 2-10%. So if you want to say of the 46 reported rapes, 4.6 are false reports, that still leaves 41 reported rapists. And when you include the 56 rapes that aren't reported, which even if you want to reduce that by 10% as well, that's still 3 out of 91 rapists who do jail time. 

Rape is a crime that is very hard to prove and it's not helped by the way rape victims are treated by system. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A few things that haven't been mentioned: Kids take their cues from their parents. So in a lot of families, the parents aren't eating healthy, but they try to force their kids to eat healthy. A big thing is to model for your children healthy eating.

Another thing is not to give them unhealthy snacks or meals more than once a week and to reinforce to them that unhealthy foods are a treat that you get on special occasions. I know families that give their kids unhealthy snacks every day or let them have soda with every dinner and then wonder whey their kids don't want to eat their vegetables.

And finally, a lot of parents don't start feeding them normal food when they're very young. But that's when you have to start -- as soon as they are old enough to eat real food. Unfortunately too many parents wait until the kid gets older and by then it's too late -- they're already used to the taste of bland pap.

So to sum: Eat healthy yourself, start the kid young, don't regularly indulge their desire to eat junk.

But if it's already too late and they're already a bad eater, you're basically stuck. There's very little way to undo it short of extravagant bribes, and even that I have found does not work on very picky eaters. </TEXT>

No it doesn't. It says that 3 of 5 convicted rapists do jail. What I posted is that 97% of all rapists don't do jail time. That number includes rapists who were not convicted.

The infographic says: of 100 rapes, 54 are not reported. Those rapists don't do jail. Of the 46 that are reported, only 12 rapists are arrested, 9 are prosecuted, 5 are convicted, and 3 do jail. Three of 100 rapists do jail time.

<TEXT> Only three out of every 100 rapists will ever spend even a single day in prison, according to a new analysis by RAINN of Justice Department data. The other 97 will walk free, facing no consequences for the violent felony they have committed. 

While the percentage of rapes reported to police has risen in recent years, a majority  54%  still are not reported, according to the Justice Department. But increasing reporting alone won't solve the problem: only about one out of four reported rapes leads to an arrest, and only about one out of four arrests leads to a felony conviction and incarceration.

But if you don't like that, here are a couple of other sources:

It would appear from Numbers 31:2627 and Deuteronomy 20:1011 that prisoners of war could be, and were, taken into bondage, but it has been contended that no prisoners of war were ever taken into private slavery (Kaufmann, Y., Toledot 1 (1937), 651).

http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/slavery.html

In Kadmoniot Ha-Halakha, Shmuel Rubinstein (Kovno, 5686) writes (chapter 22): The gemara (Kiddushin 25a) teaches: 'There are twenty-four protruding limbs of a person, for all of which a slave is set free, and these are: the tips of the fingers, toes, ears, nose, penis and breasts... Rabbi says: Also testicles. Ben Azzai says: Also the tongue.
The situation of a slave in ancient times was truly awful. He was like an object owned by his master, who was free to do whatever he wanted in order to force the slave to perform hard labor day and night, and to use him for all kinds of perverted purposes. The master could beat his slave mercilessly for any major or minor wrongdoing; he could permanently maim his limbs without fear of any punishment. For any purpose desired by the master, the slave could be blinded. Herodotus writes (4:2) that the Scythians used to blind their captive slaves so that they would work in producing butter. And there were several other such purposes for which slaves would be struck with blindness, TO THE POINT WHERE PUTTING OUT EYES BECAME A SYMBOL OF SLAVERY. Likewise, prisoners taken in war were blinded as a sign of slavery, and this was done particularly to kings and officers of the defeated army, as a sign of revenge and enslavement. For the same reason, Shimshon was blinded by the Philistines (Shoftim 16:21), and this is apparently also the meaning of the words of Nachash the Ammonite to the men of Yavesh Gil'ad: By this condition I will make a covenant with you: if you all put out your right eye (Shmuel I 11:2), as if to say, In order that you will be slaves and prisoners of war to me. For the same reason, King Tzidkiyahu was blinded by Nevukhadnetzar (Melakhim II 28:7), and this is also the meaning of the words of Datan and Aviram to Moshe, Will you put out the eyes of those men? As if to say, Are we considered in your eyes as slaves, prisoners of war, that you will exert your power over us and to do us whatever you wish, to drag us wherever you decide? This arrogance on the part of the enslavers seems to have lasted until much later times, explaining even Herod's blinding of Bava ben Buta (Bava Batra 4a).

<TEXT>  In fact, the entire concept of a POW is largely a modern development

It's not. 

Here's an interesting essay: http://www.academia.edu/3291535/_Rise_Up_and_Kill_Him_First_On_Modern_Attempts_to_Create_a_Jewish_Ethics_of_War_Nova_et_Vetera_10_2012_pp._1183-1213

Goren finds the Talmudic and Mishnaic sources more relevant to moderntimes in their debates regarding issues such as the treatment of prisonersof war and of enemy fatalities:

The ethics of war of any military in the world is demonstrated prima-rily by two categories: (a) the treatment of war prisoners; (b) the treat-ment of enemy fatalities. The contrast between the behaviour of thePeople of Israels army and the other armies at the time, regarding boththese issues, are outlined in the Bible and the Talmud . . . there is clear evidence in the scriptures that the People of Israel treated prisoners of war, including those of foreign armies, mercifully . . . This behaviour was well known among the nations of the world which were neigh-bours of the People of Israel . . . </TEXT>

<TEXT> Interesting etymology of the -crat ending.

-cracy 

word-forming element forming nouns meaning "rule or government by," from French -cratie or directly from Medieval Latin -cratia, from Greek -kratia "power, might; rule, sway; power over; a power, authority," from kratos "strength," from PIE *kre-tes- "power, strength," suffixed form of root *kar-/*ker- "hard" (see hard). The connective -o- has come to be viewed as part of it. Productive in English from c.1800.

<TEXT> Some of you might remember from a little while back that I was doing some amateur shelf reading. Someone recommended that I avoid doing non-fiction and I wholeheartedly agreed until today. I was looking for a play and discovered the non-fiction was in just as bad shape -- if not worse -- than the fiction.

The play I was looking for was listed in the catalogue as available but was nowhere to be seen. Which was not surprising considering what I found. It might have been anywhere. 

There was one thing I didn't understand. A dual-language book of poetry had the Dewey Decimal Number of something like Gle 891.621 N Dhomhnail. (I don't think this is the exact book, but it was a similar number.) I couldn't figure out what the Gle was supposed to mean so I just left the book on a shelf and hoped somebody who worked there would find its correct home, which, now that I'm looking in the catalogue, appears to be on a different floor entirely. 

I have the feeling that this poor little book will never find its home. And nobody will ever take it out because it's not where it's supposed to be and then it'll get weeded because nobody's taken it out in X number of years.

Oh the humanity!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's been a while since I've read them, but IIRC in Very Bad Deaths and Very Hard Choices by Spider Robinson a character had uncontrollable telepathy and couldn't stand to be around anyone except this one guy. (Not romances.) I didn't like them as much as I wanted to, but I'd generally recommend Spider Robinson so long as you're willing to put up with blatant political preaching. </TEXT>

When they went to commercial, the screen was supposed to go blank and the mikes were supposed to cut out, but the first time they went to commercial, the mikes stayed on. They kept talking. I don't think anybody embarrassed themselves, but what they said wasn't really meant for public consumption either.

Point is, the camera and the mikes are controlled separately. You assume that when the camera is off so are the mikes, but obviously it's not always the case and there's no little red dot to show you that the mikes are off. </TEXT>

Also, not everybody learns a foreign language from a native speaker. My French teacher in high school was American and her French accent wasn't that great. So it's not like I had anywhere to learn a French accent from in the first place. </TEXT>

Not by a lot, but on Amazon, almost every distribution of ratings is the same: A huge amount of 5 star reviews and then fewer and fewer of the rest. While on Goodreads the distributions don't have any kind of pattern. 

But I don't really find overall ratings all that helpful anyway. Usually it's the 3-star reviews that have the most objective reviews and you can get 3-star reviews on both sites. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-11-10 03:15:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's not a perfect book. The mystery is actually the weakest part of it and the main character, Claire DeWitt, can be a little off-putting, but the whole thing is so unusual, mystical, thought-provoking, richly evocative of post-Katrina New Orleans and even occasionally laugh-out-loud funny, that I thought I'd give it a rec.

It's vaguely reminiscent of The Boy Detective Fails by Joe Meno, so I'm going to give that a mention too.

<TITLE> Thoughts on "books for non-readers"? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-26 21:13:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> You'll often hear people say something like "I (or a friend) doesn't really like reading, but I like book X." I think of these books as "books for non-readers" and I was wondering precisely what is it about these books that appeals to non-readers in a way that other books don't? 

Also, is a book that appeals to non-readers similar to books that I call "brain candy" -- books that are light and fluffy and silly and require no brainpower to process at all, mostly romances but not necessarily?

Your thoughts? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Excessive worldbuilding </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-22 01:34:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It seems to me that a lot of SF and fantasy today engages in excessive worldbuilding to the extent that plot and character development almost take a back seat to description. The most notable example of course is Harry Potter and I think this is the reason why when people finish certain SF or fantasy books they wish for more is because the worldbuilding is amazing but the meat of what a book is supposed to be is lacking.

By contrast, things like LOTR, Star Wars (the movies, not the expanded universe of books), WoT and GoT do not have such extensive worldbuilding. They tell a story and when it's finished, it's finished, and you feel satisfied with it. "I wish WoT was 20 books longer" said nobody ever.

Conversely, Discworld has fairly extensive worldbuilding but you also feel satisfied at the end of most books because Terry Pratchett is great at telling a story and giving you interesting characters. 

Edit: Now that I think about it some more, I see that I can't name as many series off the top of my head as I thought I could. My memory's been influenced by the many threads bemoaning the fact that people can't get enough of X or Y world that must make it seem more common than it is. But the point still stands that it is entirely possible to engage in excessive worldbuilding to the detriment of the characters and story. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Mr. Mercedes versus the Cuckoo's Calling </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-21 17:06:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As I was reading it, I felt like Mr. Mercedes was Stephen King's answer to the Cuckoo's Calling. When a character named Trelawney popped up, that confirmed it for me.

I think that Mr. Mercedes was the better book. Though Cuckoo's writing was a bit smoother -- some of the dialogue in Mercedes was eye-rollingly bad -- Mr. Mercedes worked better as a mystery. Stephen King uses all the conventional techniques and even comes up with a couple of new ones, while Cuckoo came across like Rowling didn't know the first thing about conducting an investigation. And while the characters are a bit silly in Mercedes, at least they're vivid. As soon as I put down Cuckoo, I couldn't even remember how the mystery got resolved, let alone anything about the characters.

I read that the Silkworm is better than Cuckoo and a sequel to Mr. Mercedes is coming out next year, so I'm hoping they both will be improvements.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Goldfinch is not a very good book (review, contains minor spoilers) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-21 01:27:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First the good. Besides for the utterly boring first 70 pages and the weak, college freshman essay last 70 pages, most of the middle was fairly engrossing. Also, I laughed a couple of times.

Now for the bad. It was engrossing, but not good. The writing was weak and unedited, as judged by the spelling errors and inconsistencies, and by the plot errors and inconsistencies. She repetitively described New York using an overabundance of banal and seemingly randomly-chosen adverbs. 

The main character, Theo Decker, is a cypher. He tells us what he's feeling, but we never quite feel it ourselves. He doesn't particularly have much agency either. He mostly allows himself to get dragged around by whatever dynamic person who's around at the moment. 

The plot is incredibly weak and relies heavily on having a death every 200 pages to advance the story and/or a Dickensian coincidence. In fact, toward the beginning of the book, I was sure that this had to be a parody of Dickens, it was that bad. Later it seemed to be a bit of a Harry Potter AU fanfiction and when Theo's friend Boris starts calling him "Potter" and does so for the rest of the book, I felt entirely vindicated. There also a lot of retconning. She wrote the book over a period of 11 years and I think it shows. 

It's too bad the book didn't end with Theo successfully committing suicide. Then it might have been compared to Shakespeare or Greek tragedy and would be more meaningful for it. Instead we're treated to a long and pointless essay about art, which does nothing to life the book from its mediocrity. In 770 pages it says absolutely nothing original or insightful about art, humanity, or anything else. I am completely baffled why it won the Pulitzer. 

One positive review I read started with something like "I can't explain how much and *why* I liked the Goldfinch so much." If even people who like the book can't explain what they liked about it, it can't really be all that good. It might be appealing, but appeal and quality are not particularly correlated.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Amateur shelf reading Part II </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I originally [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2191s4/amateur_shelf_reading/) about my amateur shelf reading in /r/books because that's where I learned the term, but apparently nobody there was interested, so I decided to give you guys a shot.

Last week I did some shelf reading at my library and found a bunch of misshelved books (see previous thread). I decided to do it again this week, but I only managed to get through three shelves on one bookcase because a library worker started hovering around and I felt self-conscious. 

So now I'm wondering if somebody noticed the post or they noticed the books I'd left to be properly shelved and had the brainstorm that maybe people who actually work there (whether as employees or volunteers) should actually be doing it? If so, it's really awesome that I made an impact.

This week I looked at Par- to Patterson. Most of the misshelvings were relatively minor, though I did find a Sarah Pekkanen in there.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Review/Recommendation: The Patrick Melrose novels by Edward St. Aubyn </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-03-30 21:39:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Plot summary from Wikipedia:

Five of St Aubyn's novels, Never Mind, Bad News, Some Hope, Mother's Milk, and At Last, form The Patrick Melrose Novels, republished in a single volume in 2012. They are based on the author's own life, growing up in a highly dysfunctional upper-class English family, dealing with the deaths of both parents, alcoholism, heroin addiction and recovery, and marriage and parenthood.

They're sort of depressing and nihilistic at times, but the prose is clever, funny, easy-to-read, and thought-provoking. The best books are the first and fourth, which are written from a child's perspective. 

The other books are weak (especially the second, which comes off like a re-written Bright Lights, Big City, and the third which barely seems to have Patrick Melrose in it at all) but despite how much you pity but also despise Melrose, you feel compelled to follow him on his journey. 

The last book is a bit old hat, like the author ran out of new things to say, but it ends on a high note that doesn't lie and say that everything *is* okay, but that it very well might be okay, after all this time, finally. So you feel glad that it really is possible to transcend even the worst kind of childhood and upbringing.

Highly recommended for people who are interested in the subject matter, particularly the British upper class.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> After the discussion last week about shelf reading and my admission that it was unlikely that I would ever formally volunteer at the library, I decided to do some shelf reading on an amateur basis. It was pretty gratifying and I intend to do it again.

I did this during my lunch hour so I only had time to look over two bookcases. The books ran Sta- to Stevenson. In the two cases I found minor misshelvings such as SteiNberg ahead of SteiMberg; SteelE ahead of Steel; a book of essays that nobody seemed to realize was non-fiction and will probably be misshelved for the rest of its poor little life (because good luck trying to convince a library worker that it needs to be reclassified); some slightly worse misshelvings such as Strohmeyer; also Inferno by Dan Brown. 

Yup, Dan Brown. In the S's. 

Can't wait to see what'll turn up next. 

ETA: There were other errors but I don't remember them all. Some misshelved books I put in the right place, others I left out depending on how easy it was to find where they really belonged. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Novels versus plays versus movies </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-02-21 21:38:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I hope this is okay to post here; I figured you guys would be more familiar with plays than other subreddits.

(Background) I was writing a story that suddenly occurred to me would work better as a play, which is bizarre because while I've written a number of (unpublished) novels and took a couple of stabs at writing a screenplay, I've never been particularly interested in plays before. Plus, I've read plays, but I haven't seen too many performed.

(Question) So, what is your take on telling a story in a novel versus a play versus a movie format? Is there a particular type of story that lends itself to one format over another (aside from the obvious like action movies couldn't be plays)? What is the selling point of a play?

(Also) Would anybody be able to recommend to me plays with approximately five characters?  </TEXT>

For example, Friday I read Where'd You Go, Bernadette by Maria Semple, which is a modern-day domestic dramady set in Seattle, and Saturday I finished The Abominable by Dan Simmons, which is a historical drama/thriller largely set in England and Mount Everest. But both books have a connection to Antarctica. 

I didn't read these two books together on purpose, in fact I didn't know that Antarctica figured into Where'd You Go, Bernadette -- I took it out from the library without even reading the book jacket. 

Has this happened to you? </TEXT>

<TITLE> New pedestrians barriers at 96th and Broadway manned by traffic agents </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Seems they're trying to prevent people from crossing from the middle of the street, except I didn't see it stopping anybody but me because I was afraid the traffic agents would give me a ticket -- except they weren't paying any attention to what people were doing. (Do traffic agents even have the authority to give people tickets?)

Theoretically this is a good idea because far too many people cross when the turn signals are green and I'm amazed that nobody's gotten run over in front of me yet, but at the same time, the way this intersection is set up, if you wait to cross legally to get to the train station, you'll be waiting for much longer than if you cross in the middle. There should be a legal diagonal crosswalk light. 

I'm pretty annoyed right now.

ETA: And now they've added a big flashing sign saying not to cross, to use the crosswalks. Like, duh, as if people don't know that. But the traffic agents are gone.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm reading Blue Has No South by Alex Epstein. It's a book of really short stories, flash fiction, I guess. I'm finding them incredibly hard to understand. Here's one story. What do you make of it?

The Man Who Lived in an Elevator

In his last years in the elevator old age had disposed of his hair (in the mirror he saw the reflection of a caveman whose hair was turning white). His children, who were ashamed of him, used to stop him on the lower floors and give him pictures drawn by his grandchildren.

ETA: If you're interested, you can read almost half the stories on Google Books.

<TITLE> How old does a book have to be in order to be considered a classic? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-10-27 18:22:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There was a recent thread that had a list of classic heroines and one of them was Katniss. The Hunger Games was published in 2008; it cannot possibly be considered a classic yet.

I was thinking that a book can't be considered a classic until it's been in print at least 20-30 years. In other words, it needs to be read a generation after it was published. (50 or 60 years would be even better -- two generations after it was published.)

And if you want to talk about a series, it's 20-60 years after the *last* book was published, not the first.

Your thoughts? </TEXT>

<TITLE> A successful mediocrity versus an ambitious failure (Danielle Steel and Kate Atkinson) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-09-30 00:01:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This past week I read Life After Like by Atkinson and First Sight by Steel and I rated them very similarly (3/5 stars and 3.5/5 stars respectively). 

Atkinson's book is ambitious, creative, and fairly-well written, but overall it's just not that good. The characters and relationships aren't engaging, the basic story has been done to death, and the most creative aspect of it didn't pan out in the end.

Steel's book is pretty bad, actually. It's a dumb romance, dumb characters, fairly bad writing. Though there were a couple of plot twists that I genuinely did not see coming and that's what kept me from rating it lower.

So in the end, I slightly preferred First Sight because I wasn't disappointed by it. I knew what to expect and pretty much got it. To me it feels worse to have my hopes dashed by a book that turns out to be overhyped. 

How do you feel about books that don't live up to the hype versus mediocre bestsellers that do what they're supposed to do? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Inspired by [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1kxsut/goodreads_drama_what_do_you_think_about_rating/) post about rating a book you haven't read. 

How do you feel about someone writing/posting a negative review of a book that they deliberately haven't finished because they didn't like it?

Is it fair because not wanting to keep reading a book is a pretty good indication that there's something not good about it?

Or

Is it unfair because maybe if they'd stuck with it, they might have liked it in the end?

Or 

Does it depend based on what they didn't like about it? 

Or

Something else? </TEXT>
