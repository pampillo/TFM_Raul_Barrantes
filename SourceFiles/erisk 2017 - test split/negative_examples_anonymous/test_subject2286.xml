While authorizing Congress to levy taxes, this clause permits the levying of taxes for two purposes only: to pay the debts of the United States, and to provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States. 

The only way a tax could be illegal would be if it was levied for some purpose other than to pay the debts of the U.S., or to provide for the common defense and general welfare of the U.S. </TEXT>

3) Or that those 9 people aren't really dead, but are being hidden away somewhere?

<TEXT> Some of the new measures taking effect will include mandatory job training and minimum weekly work hour requirements, both despised enemies of lazy government leeches.

So let me get this straight, the assumption here is that if they are required to work in order to continue receiving welfare, that these people will not continue to receive welfare and will instead go out and get a job so that they will not have to get a job in order to continue receiving welfare benefits?

In 1948, the Democratic President Harry S. Truman ordered the end of racial discrimination in the U.S. Army, proposed the creation of a permanent Fair Employment Practices Commission, supported the elimination of state poll taxes (which effectively discriminated against poor blacks and whites in voting), and supported drafting federal anti-lynching laws.

<TEXT> Good. I like this. It makes me happy. People who refuse to buy health insurance screw over the rest of us when they run up huge medical bills they can't pay by causing the hospitals to charge the rest of us higher prices to make up the difference which leaves insurers no choice but to raise our rates. I'll be glad to see them voluntarily paying higher taxes that they could have avoided by simply buying something that they needed to buy in the first place. They're no better than people who build their house in a floodplain and expect FEMA to bail them out every ten years.      </TEXT>

<TEXT> If your options are

a) Your child must quit school and work or they will not eat and will always be employed in a low paying job because they are uneducated and their children will also not go to school because they too must choose working over an education.

or

b) The community will pay for your child's food so that the child may remain in school, receiving an education which will allow them to make more money as an adult and not have to choose between having their children working or getting an education.

Would any parent say "No thank you, I would like my children to remain uneducated and poor"? </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the 12 months since the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., almost every state has enacted at least one new gun law, according to a database compiled by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Nearly two-thirds of the new laws ease restrictions and expand the rights of gun owners. 

http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/12/10/us/state-gun-laws-enacted-in-the-year-since-newtown.html

If most of the new laws enacted were at the local level and "eased restrictions and expand the rights of gun owners" seems like NRA would have had more of a motive than the government. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is no such thing as "Reverse Discrimination", yes sometime black, hispanic or asian people discriminate against white people, but that is simply discrimination, not "Reverse Discrimination". The opposite of discrimination would be when someone doesn't discriminate against anyone. There is no such thing as reverse racism or reverse prejudice either. Using terms like "reverse discrimination" supports the racist myth that only white people can discriminate or be prejudice.   </TEXT>

Absolutely, we did two deployments, Higbie said. We did one in 2007 and in 2009. We did this foreign international defense over there, and its not effective. They dont have the accountability, and the understanding, and the actual fortitude to fight an enemy like ISIS whos dedicated. Theyre willing to die for this cause.
