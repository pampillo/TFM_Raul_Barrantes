<TEXT> Bad prose: E.L James, Stephanie Meyer, a fair portion of contemporary YA fiction. 

Good prose: Most any classic, Stoner^^^1, McEwan, Never Let Me Go^^^2, The Kingkiller Chronicles^^^3.

(A lot of these are maybe somewhat opinion but I think in the most, they hold up)

1. By John Williams (Not the composer). *Read it!*

2. By Kazuo Ishiguro. *Read it!*

<TEXT> Yeah. I thought it was pretty obvious (with the new look) that it would be a different Joker origin. Nolan didn't quite go with canon anyway for Ledger. And then WB put a new spin on Leto's joker with an alternative origin. 

They pretty much had to do that, though. So it wasn't so similar to Ledger/Nolan. And so it fit in with the comic-book arc.  </TEXT>

I don't mind that they're doing something different with him. And I don't blame them for taking steps to differentiate between the last incarnation so recently after it.

<TEXT> Compared to some of the more recent trailers, it feels like SS and BvS have been very bare. I know SS is more of a teaser, so we'll have to wait and see on that one but so far so good.

The spray paint on Superman for felt like it was just putting the audience into the right point within the film - so we know how that film-universe feels about Superman. The God imagery did get a bit too much in Man of Steel, so I do hope they tone down in this one. Especially with all of the controversy about him.

My feelings with the Joker is that it's too conscientiously different from Ledger's. They've looked at how Nolan does it and then contrived to go in as far the opposite direction as possible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Isn't Aquaman in it too? Whoop! 

I understand what you mean about Superman and his motives. But to me it looks like it really will be Batman attacking and Superman defending. Then, when humanity turns on him, he might just take it all out on Batman, who is kinda provoking him, and kick his ass. 

I never really had a fault with Man of Steel. The whole reason to side against Zod was so as not to doom an entire race. That makes sense. So now that he's saved Earth, the humans turn on him, and Batman is at the forefront of that. That feels like Superman's motivations to me.

I'm just excited to see how it goes in with the Suicide Squad, and the Joker. Well, not just excited. Also excited. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think McEwan's longer novels aren't as good as his shorter ones (except *The Children Act*). So I liked *The Cement Garden* and *On Chesil Beach* a fair bit more than *Atonement*. I think *Sweet Tooth* is the exception to that rule, because I quite liked that, a touch more than Atonement. I couldn't even finish *Solar*, but I might come back to that one now I'm a bit older.

And if you do do it, at least you know how to take care of it. I wouldn't skimp out on washing it thoroughly. Twice as thoroughly as any other tattoo you have. </TEXT>

Also, if you are heavily tattooed the last thing you want/need is some squiggly uneven black mark messing it up. Because - let's face it - you're not going to do a fantastic job :/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> People like Anita S are barely journalists though. In the case of Anita S, she isn't even talking about games that could be described as even approaching journalistic. Reviewers, and magazines (both on and offline) entail journalism. You're suggesting imposing restrictions on people who don't need restrictions. People like Anita S (to use your example) are well known within the community. Any decent journalist the viewers would know to trust thanks to word of mouth, and would therefore not need these checks.  </TEXT>

And then just learn it. There are plenty of free tools to learn how to use them, and just make something. If you get Unity the 'Tornado Twins' have a brilliant tutorial covering the entire basics for Unity.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Breaking into the industry isn't easy. And you might think with all of these indie games clawing for air every five seconds, you might find a place. But the thing is for every game there's another hundred guys trying to break into the industry. For every game another dozen never get finished.

Learn a skill, make yourself stand out. You have to do something. Programming. Art. A lot of indie studios take on writers now. Look into it. It's something you can do as a hobby on the side. Learn Unity or Unreal Engine. Practice making your own stuff. It's difficult. Hella difficult. I failed at it. But, hey, who said dreams ought to be easy? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The thing about DC is that it absolutely feels like their shoe-horning characters together to compete with The Avengers. That might not be the case. But a film with introducing a new Batman, Wonder-Woman and Aquaman might be a bit much.

As for the suicide squad...the entire trailer felt like just a frame to introduce The Joker at the end. There was nothing else to it. A few character snaps and then Leto. And my concern for Leto's Joker is that it's possibly going to be based mainly on ensuring that it isn't like Ledger's uber-succesful one. This isn't a criticism of the film, just that trailer. There's also no way that we can see as much of the characters SS as we would want to. So some are going to get left behind.

And I like that DC are being more gritty. I love the MCU but I'm really dying to see something else. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's pretty obvious to say we spend far too much time on social media. On the internet as a whole. Googling things to find out even the simplest of questions. 

Say what you will about what this has done for society because, assuming there isn't some colossal catastrophe, we have a fixation with documenting every single thing we do. And sure, it's annoying now, but in a hundred years, historians will be able to look back and pinpoint this time as the first time that history was never a huge question mark. They'll be able to look back and see perfectly what we were like, what we did in our spare time, how we felt about everything. We have photographic proof of the food we eat, and the things we liked to watch. We have videos of what we used to do, and looked like and sounded like. For the first time we don't have to guess and assume and put together tiny pieces of a much larger puzzle piece, because it's all there, laid out for future generations.

And that, to me, is pretty damn exciting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Abhorsen trilogy is like this. The second installment, Lirael, is longest, and Abhorsen, the finale, is the shrotest of the lot.

Also The Night Angel Trilogy gets shorter by each book. 

I also think this is quite a trend with YA where the original idea only fills up the first book, and the rest is just meandering bullshit - clasping at straws to drag the bastard out into a trilogy.

Also the 'The Passage' series. It isn't finished yet but the second book, 'The Twelve' is about half the size of the The Passage, the first one. The last book isn't out yet,  :'(, so we'll have to get a final count for that.

These are just the books I can look to my bookshelf and see.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There have been times when It's been late and I've had to stop writing because I have scared myself. I guess that's stupid, but I scare easily. 

Just, when you write your serial novels where you want to put them for people to read them on the web. You said forum host, not sure what that means.

I just assumed you had a kind of a strategy for putting them on the web. Where to put them, how often, how to make get max views, that sorta thing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We don't know what the year is. I can load, cock and fire an assault rifle in seconds, but I cannot read a clock. Signs I have read on my campaigns tell me I'm near a place called London. I have never seen the ocean, very few of us have, so I have never left this place. 

First there were the wars. Then we lost people. Then towns and cities were leveled. Then, there were no more countries. I have counted the days I have marched between seeing one green thing, and another. The rest is brown, dead earth and grey, oppressive skies.

Another sign says I'm in London proper. The building's here are the tallest I have ever seen. Though the bones penetrating free from the top of their brick tell me they are no longer as tall as they once were. We will put an end to this war. Not that I, or my parents, or their parents, had any damn clue what we were fighting for. Here we will meet the factions, and we will lay down our arms, and we will dance, and drink. 

The water here is black, and it swallows our weapons and erases them from existence. We spend the night building bonfires, hunting wild animals and drinking the fermented apples and grapes we have brought with us. I meet a girl. And two weeks later we have fallen in love.

There are no more wars. No more enemies. Only allies, and peace. We are left alone, this dark-haired girl and I, to explore this London on our own.

Three weeks later I meet a man whose name I never learned. And when I see him in the arms of my dark-haired girl I attack him and beat him to death. 

War is reignited. There is no war without love. And there is no love without war. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The room is unnervingly silver. Each wall is a blacked out window and the two subjects feel that through each, eyes are watching them. The room is perfectly square, with a silver table lining one side.

This surface is lined with knives and tools. Each brand new, never used. A circular saw (plugged through the wall and out). A scalpel. A butcher's knife and a meat cleaver. A wire saw. And others.

In the middle there are two surfaces, beds. Again, silver. So shiny and clean that anyone leaning over it would see their reflection staring back at them perfectly. These beds are unremarkable except for the cuffs designed to hold arms and ankles in place, and the bands to stop the person moving entirely.

But the most remarkable thing, as the subject enters the room, is the person standing up and strapped against the only wall that wasn't a window. It was a he, middle-aged and insignificant looking, if not entirely unattractive. He was bound to the wall by his hands and feet and chest, and gagged. He stares at the newcomer mournfully, his eyes a perfect display of pain and sorrow that the new subject couldn't help but feel guilty for. Though without reason.

From no where comes a buzz of static, and a voice. 'Hello, subject 12.This is subject 11. Can I just confirm that neither have you have ever seen each other before in your lives?'

They both shake their heads.

'Good,' the voice continues. 'The purpose of this test is simple. Subject 11 here will die.'

The person across the room visibly shakes and audibly moans, echoing loudly.

'You, subject 12, may stop that. What you cannot stop is him getting hurt entirely. Across the room from you are some utensils. The rules are simple, and the decision is entirely up to you. If you do not harm yourself, at all, subject 11 will die. Slowly, horribly and painfully. If you, subject 12, were to say pick up that knife there and cut off your finger, subject 11 might only lose both his arms. Cut out your eye, and subject 11 might only lose a hand. Understand? Inflict greater pain on yourself, and you will save the stranger a lot of pain himself. The door behind you is unlocked, you can leave anytime you want. Good luck.'

5 grand. And all it might cost you is an arm. The ad didn't say that.

The second subject crosses the room and looks at the instruments laid out in front of them. The man watches their progress. Watches as they gently finger each item. Subject 11 coos as they brush past the circular saw. Cowers when they pick up a bread knife. 

*What to do, to save the life of a stranger?*

*Is my life,* thinks subject 12, *worth that of a strangers?*

They pick up the scalpel and threaten their eye with it, so close they can see the edge. They drop it. They press the trigger on the saw, and it whirs to life with the crisp, robotic sound of ear-splitting whirring. It goes back on the surface. They place their finger over the edge and raise high the meat cleaver. Hesitate. Put their wrist their instead.

*Is it worth it?*

Back goes the meat cleaver.

*Am I worth more than this man?*

Usually both if I can squeeze them in. And I try and do that till 5. Then it's read for a few hours, mooch on Netflix, eat my tea, and play a game on Xbox or read some more or watch a film. </TEXT>

By format do you mean non-chronology? 

Possibly. Hard to say. Like I said the non-chronology was the result of something's not working together, that eventually turned out to work really well when I looked at them from a different angle. It wasn't wholly intentional. Why? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dreams are fascinating because even though we understand that REM sleep is our brains way of cataloging the events of the day. And the reason why our brains wierd out in the night is pretty well known, why all these things come together and allow us to run through (seemingly) absolutely random stories and events, with somewhat clear images and emotions, we have no idea. But our bodies are so used to this that the brain paralyzes itself during sleep so we don't enact these dreams. That's pretty...fascinating. </TEXT>

Also, having things online doesn't stop them being published. Of course, you'll have to take them down. But no one would forgo a piece of writing because it was on the internet.

<TEXT> If you're definitely going to change your story vastly, then making as resolute an outline of the changed version as possible. You want to make the merger as streamlined as possible. It depends if you want this new draft to resemble the original at all, or not. If you do want to, then just write an outline of changes. Otherwise go full draft.

I've never rewritten something from scratch no. I spent three years writing my novel no way I was going to rewrite the damn thing. But I did spend a year editing it.

You have to be aware of the limitations of your novel. You don't want to spend the next two years reworking this, if you would benefit more from moving on to something else. That's what I had to tell myself. After a year of editing, the novel wasn't getting any better, into the drawer with it. It's definitely something worth doing, rewriting the novel. But give yourself a doable time-frame, and don't ever extend it. Stick to it like your life depends on it.  </TEXT>

One is someone who calmly explains the benefits of each system, and why, perhaps, the PC is a better choice, if the asker is so inclined.

Then there are the people who blindly bash away at people who have asked what console to have, spouting mindlessly to get a PC, without any real reason why. The kind of people who don't make cases logically, just blindly declare PC is best for them, and therefore everyone.

Also because, for a post asking about consoles, you have to take a step back and say "Yeah, consoles are great, but have you thought about a PC, here's why..."

They don't do that. If they did that I would be fine with it. It's just when they spout *"Get a PC"*. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is commercial, and I know of authors who have recognised that and entered the market for purely financial reasons, but I don't think this is the case for all writers. 

Once something gets popular, say, Twilight, a lot of people try to emulate that success, so we get a market saturated with emo vampires. Now Meyer, who is the most successful, isn't to blame here (except for Breaking Dawn). The original trilogy was fine, and she, as a previous author, wasn't just writing for the money (except Breaking Dawn). Those that came after her, copying her, did. 

Otherwise, you are perfectly correct. </TEXT>

All of these taglines on their own are pretty awesome. And they stand up as solid novels. But the tagline doesn't extend to the sequels. So they has in a sub-plut (post-apocalypse - evil government, post-apocalypse - evil government, post-apocalypse - evil government)+ and that's how it plays out for the rest of the sequels

+I didn't choose all three of us because they embodied those theme. I chose them because I have read them all, they just so happen to have the same *freaking* antagonist!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Structure is sitting down every day at a certain time and writing. 

This is a craft, it's art. There is no shortcut to getting better, no trick or roundabout way. There is only one: to write. Everything else is...arbitrary. Except reading. 

Look up what everybody's advice is about how to get better at writing. It's not to enhance your vocabulary (which is a side-effect of reading widely and reading well), it's not to read as many 'how-to-write' books as possible (9/10 of which are BS scams anyway). It's to read and to write. That's it.

You want a goal? 500 words a day. If you can put in more time, go for higher. I try and write a thousand. If I'm feeling good, I can pump that out in an hour. Then I move onto my scripts, or writing my games. If I do all that - back to my novel.

You might benefit more from books on writing than I do, I've always found them a waste of time; purely because I could be writing instead. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The technique and ideas for editing have already been pretty thoroughly laid out by others, so here's my two cents.

Traditional publishing and self-publishing are nothing even remotely alike. Don't throw yourself at one or the other. Research and research and research thoroughly. Written accounts, agents accounts, testimonials. Everything, for both sides.

As it stands you have to have a super duper amount of faith in the project to pay someone to work on it. 

Even more pertinent: you don't have to worry about any of this until the book is finished. Nothing else matters till then. 

Good luck :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everything you're going to try and do will be to improve it. It's going to change a lot of in editing either way.

I think the best thing to do would be to summarise the plot in bullet points, and then create a list of events that you would change, and then see which one you prefer, which you hate. Once you can see an overview of the new canvas you might see how much you like, or dislike, the new version. 

If it changes that's fine, so long as all the changes are for the best. Of course at this stage it might be good seeking other people's opinions, because if you're unsure how to move forward on your own it's always worth just getting a second opinion :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is a cost, that's why I have to ask.

I'm a writer. I'm writing a novel, and I'm working hard on it. I'm writing a short film, and I'm writing for some indie game developers as well. I'm doing everything I've always wanted to.

But I got made redundant, about two months ago. 

I have enough money saved to keep me going for a few months longer, if I'm careful with it. But it won't last forever.

So my question is; should I continue doing what I'm doing, and pushing myself to fulfill my dream? Or should I get a job? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The best time's I had with my friends were on Halo/Halo Wars online. (We used to kick so much ass one Halo Wars, were unstoppable). Me and a friend got super-amazing at SSB on the gamecube, and later the Wii, to the point where we were so matched out fights would last half-an-hour. But other than that, it was all online regardless. 

And Nintendo still do that. Most of their games (Mario Kart, SSB) cater to a couch co-op market. 

I don't think I miss sitting at my friends house drinking cheap beer we had nicked from our parents, I miss that time of my life in general. The gaming has little to do it. 

And I think if I were to say what I missed specifically it would be the nostalgia speaking. There was nothing explicitly amazing about gaming except how I approached it as a young child new to it all. 

I would have liked to have seen games be introduced, and be influenced and been a part of the industry at the time when it was new, and they were just setting the rules. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Andromeda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udAL48P5NJU)

This is a compilation of images taken with the Hubble telescope, and gives us the most in depth image of Andromeda ever. The image doesn't just do it justice so I've linked a youtube video.

The video selects a portion of Andromeda, somewhat on the fringes and zooms in. And the image just keeps getting noisier and grainier and it keeps happening, and thousands of dots just keep appearing and appearing. And then you reach a moment where the noise falls apart and you realise that all those tiny pixels you mistook for grains...are fucking stars. 

[Also this heartbreaking image, and the story behind it is a really fascinating. Worth looking into, and about the photographer as well.](https://iconicphotos.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/kevin-carter-vulture.jpg?w=700 h=466)

<TEXT> Missed out on?

Gaming is as good as it's ever been. It's at its peak, better than ever. We have different platforms to purchase games. Making games has become so much easier, leading to an incredible rise in the Indie gaming market, which has given us some of the best games ever made, and allowed hundreds to pursue dreams they otherwise might have to have given up on. I can whip out my phone and play a game any time. And I can do it for free. 

The technology is incredible, everything that gaming has to offer is mindblowing. Games are being incorporated into education and healthcare. The console and gaming market is a thriving economy that employs thousands of people globally, and reaches thousands more to give them an outlet of entertainment that can't compare to even a decade ago.

Narrative, and characterisation, alongside fleshed out gameplay have come to a head and that's amazing. 

I honestly wouldn't wish for anything else.

<TEXT> First of all, before you separate yourself from your novel for a month, here's what I recommend. Read through it now, and just correct any grammatical mistakes, typo's, just all the little things. While the novel is still fresh in your head. You'll be thanking your old self in a months time after spending so long away from it.

The thing is your first draft is meant to be malleable. The editing stage is the point where the book *changes*. You have to sit back and look and decide what serves the story best. It might turn out that involves changing a whole lot, but hey, your story doesn't deserve any less.

It might take a lot of time to do, so it depends how much time you want to put into it. I spent a year editing my novel for nothing to happen with it. You just gotta do it. Don't hesitate because it's a big undertaking, or because your attached to your work. Gut that manuscript till it's bloodless. It's a hard thing to do, but it absolutely must be done. 

Best advice I found when to stop editing? When you find yourself changing things back to what they were originally, stop. You just gotta see what's best for the story. And if you change it only to discover it was better as it was before, now you know. Just change it back, and then leave it for good.

Also, just want to point out the *vast* distinction that has to be made between Pixar and Disney. They are not the same thing. Pixar are incredible, Disney are not. 

Not a shot at the OP, but Inside Out is *not* a Disney movie.

Keyboards were actually invented to make the user type as *slow* as possible. That's why they're so random. On typewriters, if the user typed too fast the machine would jam. So keys were placed in non-alphabetical order, and as random as possible to slow us down. Then we just got used to them, and they never changed. </TEXT>

When I had my first PC it was still on dial-up. We used to have a farm game that played the song "B-I-N-G-O". If you know/remember that song.

<TEXT> I'm mad about the scene in the book. 

The thing is, that is the *worst* trilogy I've ever read. And I've read Twilight. The Hunger Games is a good book. Catching Fire and Mockingjay are both totally, absolutely abysmal. So some of that hatred bleeds over into the films. 

I'm not mad at the films. Catching Fire was a good film. I'm against splitting the third book in two because *it's absolutely fucking awful, and* nothing *happens*. So the third film wasn't the best. But I'm waiting to see what they do with the third one. They've maintained a fair level with the films so I think it's only fair of me to expect the finale to be not totally awful. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Titanfall had giant robots. COD might be doing better than it, but that's purely because the game already has a solid fanbase. Possibly (assuming here) made of pre-teens who don't really know a lot else about gaming so they stick to it. 

Team Fortress 2. That's a solid example of an FPS done right. I also quite liked Evolve. I know that isn't *quite* the same. But running around and hunting a giant monster is far better than running around and hoping you can start shooting someone before they start shooting you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> AW is a touch better but is still at it's core: run around firing your gun. And...AW shifted the format a bit and they added verticality. But they were too late to the verticality game because Titanfall was all over that. So at it's core it's still COD just with a pinch of Titanfall, and a smidgen of the power-ups from Halo 3. Which...isn't enough. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If meat (red and white) forms a dietary staple, then...yeah. Need it to be kinda healthy. And sure you can replace it with pills, but those won't carry you through the same way.

It's not a matter of cooking. Well I should include pasta. I'll let you have that. I'm just not fond of veggies. 

I'm pretty sure that ethics is by its very definition without facts. Ethics and morals mean something entirely different for two different people. I mean, anything can aim to make a claim factual, that doesn't make it a genuine fact. I would on principle disagree with anyone or anything who tried to convince me I had to bend my beliefs to suit what they have decided. 

Are you implying we should be spoon fed our morals and ethical beliefs? Sure, some of what we take is given to us by our societies and we take that, we don't have a choice with that. Everything else we're pretty much left to decide for ourselves. </TEXT>

Quantum physics(well, any science) /= ethics. My own opinions and ethics and morals I'm quite happy to decide by myself. And, just as a result of life, those things will change for me, that's just what happens. People I meet might change them, opinions are meant to be flexible. But at least I'm not being spoon fed everything I ought to decide by myself.

Don't worry, Withcer 3 is nothing like it.

The feel of Skyrim and TW3 are nothing alike. TW3 is much heavier, much more demanding. Both storywise and gameplay wise. But the worlds are equivalently epic and comparable. 

Just yeah...Get The Witcher 3. If you like high fantasy, especially TES, you'll love this. Also, you should play TW2, not to play TW3, just because it too is an awesome game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was raised a catholic, attended wholly catholic schools, and was confirmed into the religion as a teenager.

I don't believe in God. 

I don't think that God is important as a figure that *exists*. But just as something to put your faith in. To give the feeling of something bigger than yourself, that exists outside of you. It's a comfort. And, even as an atheist, I think churches, mostly, are great things - when done right. Their the only real figure that promotes peace, love and charity on any scale, I think, societally, that's important.

<TEXT> I came across something which is a great way of measuring classics. Which is to compare it to the things that were out when it was published. The Catcher in the Rye was the first of it's kind, and whilst I don't think it's aged well, it certainly is/was deserving of it's classic status.

But you've actually hit on the reasons why the book is a good one. 

 he spends the entire book whining about how his life and choices are all some one else's problem.

Because he doesn't want to face responsibility. He doesn't want be an adult, as he says; a phony.  He isn't, as a character, meant to have a redeeming feature. That is his character. And yeah, nowadays, it's not very interesting, but *that is his character.* He's stuck in a loop. Stuck between being a teen, and being an adult, that's why he wants to be *The Catcher in the Rye*. 

John Green explains it better. If you want to get anything out of the book, [watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R66eQLLOins) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whether or not the top starts to fall isn't important, because GET THIS:

*The top wasn't Cobbs totem*

This isn't my own theory, this is one from the internet...

The totem was his wedding ring. Now we know the Top was Mal's totem to begin with. But at the beginning of the film exposition-Arthur explained that anybody else knowing anything about a person's totem negates it. *But Mal is dead* you say? Well, she isn't. Not to Cobb. Who constantly sees her to the point she is the antagonist of the movie. The top being Cobbs totem totally negates it's existence.

But, for the shrewder ones among you, they will have noticed Cobbs ring. In the dream, he is wearing it. Outside of the dream, he isn't. In the ending scene, he isn't. The top doesn't decide it at all.

In fact Nolan has said that the top wobbling at the end isn't anything to do with the dream or not. It's to do with how little Cobb now gives a crap about the dream, the dream-world and his past life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, so, first time I've ever changed strings (yay). I don't even wanna mention how long *that* took. But anyway...So from what I've heard the strings will keep on popping out of tune, and that's fine. At what kind of time will that *stop* happening? So if it continues for longer than it ought to I can probably but it down to the strings being buggared (my own fault).

Also, so the strings need to stretch. Should I give them a while to get used to being stretched, even a little bit? Should I wait until tomorrow to play on them? Or are they good to go - just be prepared to keep on tuning them?

Any other advice or tidbits I missed out which are important? Thanks guys. </TEXT>

<TEXT> http://gamejournalismjobs.com/

This is a great site, the one I got my job from. Just don't hold out for paid work. I wrote seven articles, and got paid $.70 so...You just have to be willing to work for free.

Never heard of that Neverwinter Nights module. :)

Having a degree is certainly a boost. My degree is in film (which helps for screenplays) but not prose (which is why my novel was so important). You just have to find the right assets you possess and plug them. 

The thing about working in the industry is that it breaks into two compartments: Design, and programming. Programming is obviously...just what it says. Design covers modelling, texturing, concept art, an entire haberdashery of jobs. But nothing that commits to writing. Most studios pull writers from designers who work in another department. Like I said, not a lot of studios have dedicated writers. You could get an intership, sure. No problem. It would be mostly office work, which is something you could do. Your difficulty then comes in where to take it from the internship. You can't program, or design. If they don't need a writer, you're out of luck and stuck as an intern. 

This is why I recommend the indie route. There are a lot of indie companies out there who have formed from the previous workers of AAA studios. You probably won't start there, but you can work your way up there. It *is* a ladder. Unlike AAA gaming a lot of of indie games do put emphasis on story, and will hire a writer to allow their meagre staff to work on programming and design. That's why it's so good. If you write a game and it breaks out (mine is out in three months, here's to hoping it's successful), then you could get jobs coming to you. 

Oh, also, I've been working on this game for over a year. Coming on to two. I joined the game after they'd been working on it for nearly a year. Don't expect to have a gaming portfolio built up quickly. If you can prioritise work, and work efficiently, you can join multiple games and have a number of games released roughly the same times. Which leads me to...

Most of the jobs you join will collapse. It's the nature of the work. I've joined over 20 companies, some have just never been able to stay in contact, of their ideas are too ambitious, or the team just implodes. If you can work out quickly which teams are likely to stick at it and which aren't, you'll do yourself a big favour. Mostly the best way to check is to look for if the studio has anything previously released.

Also, look into GDD's, writing crowd-funding campaigns and other writer-y things. Again, it's all to put into the portfolio. You want to convince the team you're the best person so show them you can do more than write a story. Anything that involves words, you can cover it, you're the guy to do it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> YES YES YES YES!

I didn't get this until last year, which was a couple of years after it 'resurged'. Not reading this book the moment it piqued my interest was a mistake. Normally when I finish a book I mull it over and decide how much I like the final product, whether or not it approaches the level of my favourite novels. But with this I was a few pages in and I just *knew* it was amazing, that it would go on to be one of my favourites. The prose was consitently beautiful throughout, each stage of his life was heart-wrenching and human and true. I was so surprised by how amazing it was, because it was just fantastic. No one could have expected a novel to be so good. It set out to do something unique, and it really delivered! 

I would love someone to write something so in-depth about a life like that in modern times. Would be a really interesting look at our society. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I always give my characters two things:

Values, and

Motivations.

What does your character value? What motivates them? For characters enduring a journey, that's a large part of it done. I know that characters aren't always that simple and there are shade of grey. So introduce bi-values and bi-motivations. At the end of the day we are all just trying to keep a hold of what we value, and what we want (how motivated we are to get what we want though...)

Creates interesting arcs as, when the story develops, their values and motivations change. Or one changes but not the other.

A lot of the time these two coincide.

<TEXT> Understand. You won't get hired to be in the industry. You won't. Not a chance. There are a small handful of companies who hire dedicated writers, and, I'm sorry, you're not going to land a job straight away writing for Irrational Games.

Indie games though, that's the way to do it. But understand that every single writer, who doesn't know anything about *making* games and just wants to *write*, is trying to break into the indie scene in the same manner, it's super over-saturated.

Here's what I did:

write stories and write screenplays. Demonstrate you can write both prose and dialogue. If you can hand in a properly formatted screenplay (alla Celtx) all the better. I had a completed novel underneath me when I started to apply. It demonstrated I can stick to a task, and won't flake. It was also in decent condition, and I was pretty happy presenting it as the main part of my portfolio.

Get your hands on Unity or UE and learn basic game programming and modelling. Nothing heavy, just enough to understand how everything is working under the hood. Be aware what the rest of the team is doing, and, above all, understand the limitations of the medium and that *the story never, ever comes before gameplay*. If you can show that you have a basic knowledge of Java or a C language, or of art and model design, it again shows a willingness to learn and get involved. I'll tell you why this is important. I write big, I like big scenes that are incredibly cinematic, but I know they can't be made. I understand how the team are limited, by time (mostly) but also by the engine limitations and priorities; and making sure the game works comes before the story. If you are writing, and you understand that something won't work, you can save a lot of time and hassle by understanding that an idea won't work, and just hand in a more tame version.

I found work for an online gaming magazine, and wrote a few articles. Show dedication to the medium, show insight and passion. Again, a good portfolio helps for this.

Breaking in isn't easy, you really have to make yourself stand out.

I think that's everything...

<TEXT> It never struck be as being anti-religious for the sake of being anti-religious. I actually don't think it's a reflection on Christianity because Christianity didn't exist. It's an interesting idea about how the religion could have formed, and the new testament. Without it ever really being a bash at religion. It just removes the miracles and makes Jesus a normal man. Which I think is ok. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure. Just appreciate the ramifications of your protagonist expecting his younger sister to enjoy being raped. Sure, he doesn't understand, and the audience will get that. But you've still got to write it. As long as you don't dwell too heavily on it. Perhaps her screaming is him first realising something isn't right, it's not the same as all the other times. The catalyst for him to start panicking and *really* worrying about his sister. 

So phrase it as "something was wrong, this wasn't like the others times."

Than; "The others had liked, why didn't my sister, I thought she would like it."

Everything will be ok. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Then you lose his innocence. You can take it multiple ways. It's possible he's familiar with sex, but being familiar with the concept of rape could be a bit much.

I think that even if he understands what is happening it hinges on him not quite grasping why it's such a wrong with to do? Am I right? If he's just upset because his sister is crying, and in pain - that'll do. He doesn't quite understand *what* it is exactly that's causing that. He just understands its something bad. 

Maybe he does understand. But just think about what kind of an edge you want the scene to have. You can make it excruciatingly sharp if he's very innocent and doesn't understand. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To the contrary, holding down a blog would likely significantly boost your productivity towards a story.

Let's face it, you can't spend an entire day writing a story. You'll burn out, or get bored, inevitably procrastinate. But, rather than not be writing, you could be writing a blog post. This will break up your writing, going from story to blog and back. It'll keep you in the right frame of mind. As mentioned, if you work in tidbits about your novel (even just progress, anything you're struggling with) it'll keep you motivated and on point. You won't be working on the novel, but you'll be thinking about it. Kinda passively working on it - in a way. Having an audience might be significant boost to your writing as well. Keeping a blog is fun and an audience gives it a point to exist: if you're writing about your novel, that point to exist comes over to your novel. You're more motivated to work on it.

I hope that made sense. I'm sorry if it's all gibberish.

To summarise: keep blog, it will help. Focus less on it. 

Maybe update once a week. Don't write too much. You have to give yourself a break from your novel, nothing wrong with that. So put that break into a blog. Stull being productive. </TEXT>

Titan doing wall of dawn and the quote is fine. Just think about what you want and where, and what it might entail.

Also, don't forget you might not like the game when you're older. You really have to think about the future with a tattoo as niche as a gamer tattoo, and with as much detail as the one you want. </TEXT>

The two I'm struggling with are: D, and Bm.

There isn't enough space on the neck to play the D chord, is there a more efficient way than using all three fingers? I'm always pushing one finger off the fret, so one string sounds muted.

Bm is just a pain in the ass, looking for hints and tips.

<TEXT> I had a dream about a mouse. It was a really messed up dream. Let me give you some backstory - just a little. There were two mice, siblings, and their mother. I had been looking after these mice all day, but they kept on running away. My day had consisted of myself looking for these two tiny mice. Just the siblings. Sometimes I'd find them, and they'd get away again. I had to look after them, that was really important. When they were lost I had to find them.

I don't know what happened to the one. But I was with people, and they asked me if I was hungry. So they went and got fish 'n' chips while I sat on a wall, looking on the floor for two mice. I hadn't seen them for a long time - and I was very worried.

Eventually the others returned and they passed me a folded up paper bag. I opened it up and out popped this nose shape. A tiny mouse shaped nose. But it had been battered and deep fried - like a fish.

I know that sounds fucking stupid. But as this tiny orange nose-shape poked out it hit me that it was the mouse. And then it hit me again that someone had fucking deep fried it. Had probably boiled it alive and battered it. And then someone had given it to me. Knowing full well I was meant to look after them.

I forgot about it in the morning. In midday I was reminded, I nearly broke down into tears. 

I don't think I've just felt so...helpless, like I've ever lost something so totally, and failed so miserably. Just opening that bag and seeing that nose, and being hit by so many realisations. It really fucked me up. I still get sad about that mouse, sometimes. </TEXT>

So I bought the cheapest one Amazon and it just arrived. It's bright purple (which is kinda awesome), and the strings are plastic and shit - but hey, I got what I paid for (less than 20). So, if I stick at it, I'll go and buy some decent strings. And if I really stick at it, I'll buy a decent one and really go for it. For now I'm letting the strings rest (apparently they need a bit of stretching after tuning), so I'm gunna leave it alone for now and see how if it sounds any better later on. Whoot. Back to learning 'Do I Wanna Know' on bass.

Edit: it's really strange going from tuning a ukulele to tuning a bass...Like, *I have to stretch now!? This neck suddenly seems so long!* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, that's the thing about Fahrenheit 451. It's pretty universally loved.

I just didn't like the writing or the execution. He had a great setting and a really good idea and it just...felt like he didn't do anything with it. But I think if I read it again I would appreciate it more. I went in I think expecting something different, so if I read it with my head in the right place I might enjoy it more. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Generally the aim of a thing. If things are generally seen as high culture - such as books. That's so. However something done solely for the pursuit of money regardless of any art...

Maybe that doesn't declassify from high culture. Maybe it does. 

Same for anything. Film sequels made for bullshit money. Films are high culture, but are also art. 

I don't care who likes what. I don't have anything against twilight, or erotic fiction in general. If something is done for a purpose, great. If something is done for money, then it ought not be culture at all.

Yes, I've opened myself up to a lot of backlash. I know that's a flawed argument. I would rather support a low end-indie film like 'Ink' than a blockbuster film made-for-money like 50SOG. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember when I first got my original Xbox. Way back when. I really wanted to play the first Halo game. I'd heard great things about it, but the person who sold me my xbox had lent it out, and was waiting to get it back to give it to me.

I thought I could wait, and not play my xbox till I got Halo. But I got a pile of games with it. Midtown Madness. A Rayman game. A few others. But, most interestingly of all I got a game called...

Morrowind.

I didn't know what this was. The cover was a title and a symbol. And I refused to play it, waiting for Halo. I put it off. I would go over and pick up the case and look at it. For some reason I was strangely drawn to it. There was no reason for me to like it. I was young, mostly new to gaming, never really played or heard of anything like this. Didn't know what an RPG was. After a while I thought *"Dammit, I'm just gunna play this game. I can't stop thinking about it, sod Halo"*

It. Was. Amazing. It still is to this day one of the best RPG's I've played. It changed how I viewed and played games, what stories I wrote and how I wrote them. Introduced me to the concept of games being more than racing, or platforming. 

I never did get Halo. I didn't play the first one until the MCC came out on XB1. 

Also Fable 2 on Xbox 360. The only reason I got a 360, and fuck was that an amazing game. My mom got me a really good 360 (there were about two dozen version (at an estimate guess) and I was worried I wouldn't get the right one). But my Mom pulled through and got me the best one, and my Grandma got me Fable 2. First Christmas I didn't spend with my family, I was playing Fable 2.

Also Crash Bandicoot on the PS1. My parents tricked me and my sisters and pretended we had nothing. Then unveiled it. I got Space Jam. My little sister got Casper. And my big sister got Crash Bandicoot. This was in...'96?? From that moment on I've been a gamer.

Tl;dr: Morrowind for Xbox. Fable 2 for 360. Crash Bandicoot for PS1. </TEXT>

I was meant to work on my game today. I didn't. Thankfully my lead isn't too demanding just yet, and I still have time. Though I think the workload is going to smack me, and hard, when it comes. This is just for the demo. This isn't even the whole game.

Ooh! I did get to play bass. Didn't quite learn a new song but I perfected two I had been practicing and started a third.

I nearly went out a bought a ukulele for the shits and giggles - because secretly everyone wishes they could play the ukelele. Right?

About 75% less productive today than I wanted to be. I got an assignment for my *other* game today, which isn't too hard, so I hope I can chuck that out tomorrow...

I'm certainly skeptical because the inherent flaws are immediate, but I'm willing to give them a chance and see what they've done to sort them out. I don't trust expo demonstrations, I really don't. So I'm going to keep my eye out and see what happens, and how it expands, and, most importantly, on what they have to say about the gameplay.

Otherwise, it looks awesome. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Given the spate of absolutely abysmal releases recently (or not-so-recently), when a studio like CD Projekt Red comes along and does everything perfectly, they're praised. Rightly so, they even included a little slip inside the game thanking people for buying their game. That's how you do a game release right. 

Then on the other hand you have a game more typical of a AAA release: buggy, unfinished, poor quality. Complaining is the gamers way of striving for something better than what we have. 

TW3 proved that it can be done, and be done perfectly. It's easy to slate a bad game when a few weeks back we had one of the best releases in recent memory - and for a truly excellent game. 

As for frame rate issues for TW3. I got it on XB1 and I've hardly ran into any issues. </TEXT>

They used to rent out the bottom floor to holiday-makers during the summer-period, that's how nice and big it was. There was this tree we used to climb (my siblings and many, various cousins). About 2-3 acres of garden just to run around in and play. It was amazing. Really great time.

Anyway a few years back they moved out - the place was too large to look after and my grandparents were getting on. Next thing I heard it had been knocked down and a block of flats put in. That sucks.  </TEXT>

This one I have a plan for. And I think maybe a plan is better. Certainly this second novel has more depth, and more is happening underneath. The characters come together and intertwine better than in my first one. Purely because I've got it all planned out what exactly my two main protagonists are doing. Even when they're not together I know what they've been doing in the absence. 

Haven't not completed this novel I can't support a structured plan entirely - but the way things are going, I'm happy to endorse a plan. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I should have guessed that. Ah well, I answered another question for you for free :D

This novel it's about malevolent spirits. I'm heading towards a very difficult scene, that I've been slowly working my way towards sentence-by-sentence for weeks. I'm there now, just a few more details. So it's been slow progress. 

You sound like you're already aware of how bad it is to rewrite, rather than just finish. So I don't have to warn you about the pitfalls of rewriting constantly. Whatever you write you're not going to be happy with it. It's not meant to be good. It's not going to be good. It's never going to be good. Leave it be, that's how it is with everyone. It doesn't matter how many drafts you write it's still going to be the same, and you'll never like it. You have to edit it into shape. That's where it all starts to come together. When you edit it. Not when you write it. </TEXT>

* Put poetry on Figment/Reddit for feedback (done - awaiting feedback)

* Convince others to start YouTube channel with me.

* Check Shooting People [film jobs]

* Check IndieDB [indie-game jobs]

And that's it. Just do all that and my life will head in the right direction. Not. So. Easy.

<TEXT> I'd say you could possibly come back to DA after The Witcher 3, but I just think it would be so flawed after playing TW3 - an unadulterated masterpiece.

I'm sorry to have put you off DA. It started well, but didn't hold it. I wanted to like it but couldn't, so I know what it's like to have to drop a game. Let's just say - if you do drop it - I'm saving you a few hours that will only end in heartbreak. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Story is better. Combat is better. Protagonist is better. Quest system and quests are better. There isn't as much variety within the biomes - and I have to give Inquisition it's due, those dragon's were impressive. But The Witcher has better gameplay, and a more polished look. There's also less time sorting through your party to see if the trousers your mage has on is as good as the one in your pack. You only have to look after Geralt; infinitely easier. The story in The Witcher holds together tighter, even when you're away from it for a while doing Witcher-y things and side quests. 

This is all The Witcher 3, Witcher 2 is somewhat different. But if you're playing 2, finish it, it's a great game. Then move sharpish onto 3. Which is an amazing game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't write a strict outline. Write a basic one, a bare one. Chart down the major points, and nothing in between. This gives you absolute freedom to do anything in between. You have the main points down, and those are the turning points, you just head from to the other to the next. If a new character comes in, there's space to do that, if one dies, there's space for it. If something totally significant happens that you hadn't counted on, that's fine, just as long as you're heading to your next key point, you're on track.

What really matters is this: graphics don't make or break a game. Now what's an amazing game? Shadow of the Colossus. Not the best looking game. But it's one of the best that will ever be made. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, this is perfect.

That's it, I'm done. There's nothing more I can say. I few itchy word choices, but that kept the tone low and somber, rather than edgy and sick, which is what I would have gone for. 
The pace is good, the style and narrative is spot-on, absolutely perfect.

But I think the first three lines aren't as strong as the rest of the poem. I think you use those to find your voice, and it doesn't come through until the fourth line. That's my only critique. 

Thought I'd return the favour for *My Dreams are Fire* but this is kinda so perfect it belies critique.  </TEXT>

The novel is called Loki:

Loki is a born and bred survivor, having been chased for fourty years he is confident his abilities will keep him alive and out of their hands[*]. A shocking death and a surprise ambush from one of his old kin may just knock everything he knows out from under his feet. His pursuers are growing more and more desperate, and he might finally have to resurface to face them once and for all.

*generally don't know what to do with this. Their hands is too vague, but I'm trying to not be too specific.

<TEXT> Things didn't turn out as planned.

That's an understatement.

It makes me feel sick to the stomach,

and I can only just see it from your point.

But see it from mine!

If you were in love with someone else

You wouldn't give me a second though,

Wouldn't think to care how I feel...

But it was me you loved, me

You left someone else for.

I could call you a fool,

Say it was your fault,

That you shoulder the blame.

*

But Ive always been a realist:

This is my burden, and my fault.

Fuck the lessons, we dont want to be kids anymore.

But thats out of our hands, and so that's what we are: kids.

Prone to mistakes, slaves to feelings.

Greedy, malicious.



I should have seen this from the beginning.

Should have known how it would turn out.

Should have predicted the tears.

But I couldn't care for your heart,

because I don't have mine:

When you're in love that's what you give away.

*

I won't make excuses, you deserve more than my childish 
cowardice,

Trying to worm my way out of it, with no where to run.

I told you what I was like, you chose not to believe me.

Unintentionally I taught you the hard way what I was truly like.

And now I've lost myself trying to see myself for what I truly am.

Nothing, nothing.

That's what you would have seen me as.

*

I meant every kiss  if it's any condolence,

If you can believe, for even a second, anything that comes from 
my mouth,

Kiss or words. But I'll leave it up to you to decipher true from 
false.

Though I deserve nothing but your hatred.

And if it means anything, yes, shivers swept down my spine the 
first time we kissed,

And I enjoyed the moments that we shared.

But I couldn't keep it up,

Because somehow she got back into my head,

into my heart.

And I want you to know if I could have chosen, 

I would have thought things through, and, for now, I would have 
picked you.

*

I want to end this poem saying

I'm in love,

but not with you.

And it doesnt matter, as hard as you wish,

It's not you, and it never was.

I always loved her, I always will.

Neither of us will get what we want, 

thats the way it's going to be.

<TEXT> My dreams are fire.

And, Oh, how I have

dreamt.    



And the rage, and the passion, and the

Heat, and tongues of that fire

Had licked my conscious desire;

And I knew that in that one, tiny

Infinitesimal, minute moment

I could be more than this.

And yet.

And yet.

Oh, but still

That it were possible to be all 

My dreams

Have foreseen.

And not this, 

Hollow,

Impassioned being

Of caged-fire

And dewy eyed 

Desire.

<TEXT> So, we are meeting again.
You. You who still haunt my

Every waking hour

To you I am to blame

For this shell I call home.

For whom I blame for this neglect, destitution.  



I am a man.

I am a boy.

I am a human.

I am everything you

Should have known

You would leave me as.

You who are so bitter,

So spiteful. You who would

Break skin for the malevolence,

For the colour: blood.

And unto me you left this

Learners scar, 

So you could be a poet.  



I am a poet,

You are a fool,

You are a child, you are

The neglectful little 

malignance that is the 

abode of my every whim.

You are the little malicious 

Greed that left me to thirst

As you fed this fire.

This pen wouldnt fit so 

Perfectly

In my teeth if you hadnt

Shown me how to hold it.  



You are not a man,

You are not a boy,

You do not consider yourself human.

You are an object,

Arent you?

And how I hate you,

I hate

I do not hate those scars

On your arm,

Not so much as

Your fathers disappointment,

But a lesson you taught

Yourself

Well.

How alive we are.

Just you and me.

I am the form you wish you had,

But having said that

There will be more poems

To come.

<TEXT> Love the poem, excellent imagery.

But I feel it would benefit from punctuation. That is really my own opinion, and discard if you wish. But for me the poem is slow, it's thought out, and it reads meticulously, it rewards the slow reader. But without punctuation there's no pace, or style, it's just one solid read through. No chance to break, and consider, or think about what's been wrote.

Just my two cents. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Interesting start to the poem. I love it! :D

Feedback: I get that you're repeating yourself, reinforcing that the recipient is a 'cunt'. But the repetitions doesn't read well with only a comma. Try placing a full stop there. It rounds off the first 'cunt', and reads easier for the second one. Equally keep the comma, and remove the second 'you're', but I think it reads better with a full stop, as it is.

Third line: That rhyme, it's distracting, because it's the first rhyme in the poem (pretty much the only one). It feels a touch forced, and very much out of place. I get what you're trying to say, and, this is my own personal input, I didn't like it, it felt wrong. Perhaps try rewording it, find another word for defeat?

Fourth line: Touch of interpretation here. Does the person come back shrouded in' love you never going to know?'. Or is it a separate line, a second taunt. Might need breaking up, or the meaning you want (conjoined, separate) made clearer. Love the line after that.

A lot of comma's in the sentence after that. Which reads fine, it's not a fast poem. It's mostly when it comes out of 'year' into 'sitting contempt'. The whole line might need tweaking, it reads fine without any comma's between weeks, months, year, but I see what you're going for with all of those comma's. Here's an idea, try separating the list with dashes;

 and share in the revelry, but tonight - as in the past weeks, and months, and year - I sit in contempt of love lost...

Reads a touch smoother, but doesn't detract. Even if you don't take on board that idea, I think there's still something there that needs doing.

Great poem. Perfectly angsty, eye-catching beginning, and it doesn't wane for a second. Excellent final line, really homes in what the entire poem is about, and makes it count; a perfect ending. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A poem about night terrors? Most awesome! Wonderfully captured, I might add. 

Start: amazing, the alliteration really draws you in, rolls off the tongue, easy to read. Perfect. (Missed capital on 'Your'). 

Not sure what that dash is for between 'you are sure - has been bestowed'. I found it kinda distracting. It reads fine without it, and I don't feel the need for it in the least. 

That first sentence, second stanza, is pretty long, a real mouthful. Perhaps put a full-stop after 'bestowed' and remove the 'as'.

has been bestowed. You resiliently calculate the servitude of the coming episode.

Works really with the 2nd person theme, as well.

At the end of the second stanza you switch from past to present tense in the last section;

where an ugly face it showed, an even uglier grin it bares. 

This is fine if you want to say that in the nightmare it showed an ugly face, but awake an 'uglier grin it bares'. However as it reads it feels like the same, descriptive sentence, that switches tense.

Air capture? Interesting phrase. Respiration, perhaps? 

This section: *'each of your ex and inhales'*. I read 'ex' as something different, and got confused, I had to go back and then I realised you meant exhale and inhale. Easy solution, bring them together: *'ex-and-inhales'*. Makes it read faster too, which keeps up the pace, and makes it more obvious that floaty 'ex' is joined.

Third stanza: you've got a comma, a single word, and a semi-colon and I can't quite get my head around you want it to be read. The comma speeds up the pace, it could easily be a full-stop but isn't, so; read faster. But the semi-colon immediately slows it right down. Read through that sentence, get a feel for the pace, and what each punctuation does to the line, and reel it in. 

I would recommend a full stop between 'each thumb' and 'as the fear sets in'. It rounds out that last sentence, makes the 'knows it's nearly won' much more significant as it stands on it's own. It's also a long sentence that would benefit from the break. 

Fourth stanza. It wasn't until this point I realised it was about night terrors. Which is nice, because the first portion is entirely me wondering what is happening, and then suddenly realising. The poem is *absolutely* fine as it is, but consider what it would do to the poem if you made it more obvious what it was about from the get-go.

Your third sentence reads like running water *and then* you hit that darned semi-colon before vile. You don't need it, it reads fine without it, it reads better, in fact. It really just brings this whole, wonderful beat you've got going in that sentence to a jarring halt, when it could continue until the sentence ends. Without that semi-colon, that is my favourite sentence in the whole poem. 

Excellent, spine-chilling end to the poem, the rest is perfect.

You know I really liked this piece, it's actually superbly well written, and you've such a finger on the pace, it's controlled ever so tightly, you just let it slip sometimes. The word choice is great, I love it.


(It's possible you didn't intend it to be about night terrors, that's just my interpretation. You can correct me if I'm wrong. The critique stands, except that one bit about introducing the night-terrors sooner, it's all good) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello. My feeling is that you wanted *judging* to stand out more on it's own, so consider putting a full-stop after expressionless. It breaks judging off, and brings it more into it's own which I think is what you're heading for. It reads the same, just with a bigger pause.

I just want to bring attention to these two lines:

Swallowed by the sea of masqurade masks,

But yours broke long ago.


The first sentence is alliterative in two cases (swallow, sea. Masquerade, masks). And the sentence is smooth, and flows. But then it completely changes pace when you get to the next sentence and suddenly *'but'*. I think with the alliteration you can get away with the hard sylablles, (especially the 'sk' on 'mask'), but that is ruined with the, short, heavy 'but'. Perhaps change it to 'though';

though yours broke long ago.

Reads a bit smoother, coming from the alliterative previous sentence. I understand 'though' might change the story a tad - though the meaning is just as implicit. So if you don't go with 'though' I do recommend tweaking it a touch to something that leads off of the first sentence a bit smoother.

The rest of the poem is pretty darn great. I would say *perhaps* a semi-colon after 'smoulder', but I'm not sure if I'm reading that right, so it's entirely up to you.

Rest is awesome :)

P.S misspelled masquerade as masqurade (I'm sure it's just a typo, though). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I really liked this. Read it a few times and I like the story, it's different and unique and well written.

Not sure if it's a reddit thing but having it written like this it messes with the rhymes, which is fine - the rhymes come through - but it messes with the beat of the piece as well. Which, for a rhyming poem, you don't want. So consider playing around with the structure, seeing what works, what you like, and what suits the beat and those rhymes best.

Also, that comma after the semi-colon on the first line:

 No reason is there to fear, What we see and what we hear.

It works better without the comma. But then you've capitalised the W in what, so I'm not sure what you're trying to say. 

Otherwise, excellent =]

<TEXT> Aaww ah, man. Back in the day Runescape was *the shit*. I think I've played that game more than any other game - count it in months not hours or days.

If you liked Skyrim - you'll like The Witcher. Shadow of Mordor was a brilliant game, but not absolutely similar to other open-world-high-fantasy-rpg's like Skyrim or Dragon Age. 

If you want to start on *decent* fantasy - you can't do better than The Witcher. In fact you've played Skyrim, easily 2nd best. Now all you need to play is Fable Anniversary and you've hit the trifecta. (Though DA1 is always worth a play through). 

If you haven't played a lot of MMORPG's, you might like TESO, I don't know. It depends what else you've played. If you haven't a lot of MMO's - like I have - you might really like it. When you play almost all of them, they all bleed into one. I'm just waiting for the next big one that *does something different!*

Being objective there was nothing particularly wrong with TESO. It ticked the right boxes, and it was a really nice feeling to be back in Morrowind.* Just that it was generic and samey as every other one. TLOTRO and WoW included. Atlantica had a different feel to it, and different combat. FLYFF is one of the most gorgeous MMO's out there, and the aesthetic makes it feel vibrant enough you can slightly overlook that it the gameplay is the same as every other game. Aion does a lot of things well, but at it's core is the same as every other MMO. The only two I haven't played but really want to is Wildstar, but, above all, Guild Wars 2. But I ain't paying for that when I expect I won't like it.

*Morrowind is the third installment into the TES game, and is better than Oblivion, and only marginally not-as-good as Skyrim. It's starting to show it's age (has done for years) but it's one of the most vibrant and alive worlds for a game you can imagine. It's TES so the story is good, and it plays the same as Skyrim, but without the dragons. To offset the dragons the explorability of Morrowind is top-notch. This is mostly helped by the fact it isn't based on medieval England, which most every fantasy game is (and even The Witcher is guilty of). Honestly if you want a superb fantasy game outside of the limits of medieval-england-fantasy, look no farther than Morrowind. 

P.S This whole message is based on *fantasy* RPG's. Sci-fi, and otherkinds, aren't so much my expertise. </TEXT>

Ok.

You honestly want to compare that generic, tripe, pieceofshit "game", that really is just fodder for your HDD to waste. To what is, hands down, one of *the best* **games**, *not just open-world, or rpg,* **game**.

Get. The. Witcher.

Also, don't consider TESO. Really not a good MMORPG. The best MMORPG I've ever played (and I've played pretty much every one) is Atlantica. Also FLYFF.  Aion is a good shout, but there isn't much too it to separate it. Same for Rift. Wildstar looks like it might be good (one of the few I haven't played) and it's going f2p soon, so worth checking out once that happens.

Let me just enamour the Witcher 3 some more. Name an open-world game. It's better than it. Fantasy RPG's? It's the best. Over Dragon-Age and (dare I say it) Skyrim. You've been waiting for proof the new gen is worth investing in: VOILA! </TEXT>

I hide behind this viciously by saying I never tried and put all the effort into my novel, instead. I put him down by saying "well I was smarter than you in High School" which I know damn well ain't true.

So like I said I don't know if it's an inferiority complex. But whenever I feel...inferior, I lash out like an asshole and try and put myself above him, if not about the same thing (say, academically) then about something else. And I don't like being an asshole.

And yes, it makes me super competitive, and sometimes a sore loser - but I know when I'm going to be beat, and I don't mind if I foresee it. Usually it makes me just not want to compete.

Inferiority complex? Or asshole-ism?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dwarf Fortress is hella intimidating, I'm looking into it myself but it might prove too much.

Yeah, sorry about the minecraft thing. I think once it gets into it it will separate from MC quite drastically. By the looks of it it's much more of a "town-sim" to MC's "build-for-the-shits-and-giggles." </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Stoner, by John Williams*. One of the best books ever written. And the most in-depth look, the most human showcase in any book I've ever found. It essentially follows the life of one man, William Stoner, from birth to death. Truly an amazing book. But it does take place mostly early to mid 1900's, so it's not a contemporary setting, if that detracts anything for you.

I also recommend the hard-back edition with the grey cover. Not only does it look nicer, it's also the best binding *ever*. And how many books can claim that accolade?

Also, though to a lesser extend. *Humans, by Matt Haig*. It's about an alien who inhabits a human body and has to come to terms with what it means to be human. It's not a heavy book, and makes for a pretty light read. It has its moments, but it's not quite an in-depth look at the "human experience" as you might want. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't like AC1 to be honest. Far too repetitive. But AC2 was amazing. And I liked Brotherhood, and Revelations. Ac3 was a colossal disappointment, which I didn't even finish, because it wasted the first few hours of my gameplay as *not even the main character*.
(It also skips over how hundreds of years of generations are Assassins but then suddenly, *templar!*,).
Black Flag was simply great. And they really fucked up with Unity. Not just because it was shit, but because they took out the core mechanic that made Black Flag amazing.

But I am interested in the new one. I've been saying they should set one in London since AC2, so I'm pretty interested to play a title set in my own home. Having said that, will definitely be checking reviews before I get it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wrote my whole novel this way. Just had loose ideas of where it was heading, but in general the entire novel happened organically. 

It took me longer to write than it should have. I think that's how you pay. What took me the longest to write wasn't the writing, it was trying to figure out which direction to take it in.

My new novel I sat down, spent two months planning it out, making everything fit, so it worked and I had a decent plan I could follow. I haven't sunk my teeth into that project yet but now I know it won't take me as long. There are scenes that are harder to write, some I don't want to write. And that was true in my first novel, so I didn't write them, I put it off. Now I have a plan I know exactly what is going to happen in that scene, I've come to terms with it, so I can just get down to it. 

I don't want to say planning is the best way to go until I've finished my current novel. But having worked on a novel that I wrote organically, I wouldn't support it wholeheartedly.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah I think your right about that. I just don't think Bane was any kind of follow-up to the Joker. If Bane had come first it might have been a different story, the problem was that he had to follow Ledger's Joker. Nolan dug himself a hole with such a brilliant villain, and a great film. There was no way the third film could have competed against it.

Having said that TDKR is by all standards a decent film. And you have to respect the shit out of Nolan for actually ripping a plane to pieces, rather then hollywood-ising it and using CG. The rest of the film could have been shit (it wouldn't) but that remains one of the best opening scenes to a film ever. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's hard to say without reading the previous Sapkowski novels, or playing the original 2 TES games. 3 if you never played Morrowind. 

Morrowind was an entire construction in it's own. They wrote novel after novel of information for that game, just to create backstory. The world has been growing since the very first TES game 'Arena'. For contemporary players - who perhaps joined at Oblivion, or even Skyrim, there might not be a lot to offer. 

Equally, people who only joined the game at The Wild Hunt might miss out on a lot of the world only gleamed through either the original novels, or the first two games. 

I think what settles this is where they came from. TES was never meant to be more than a game. The aim of its construction was, above all, to make a game that was as enjoyable as possible. It was built on the idea of *there's a goblin, here's a pointy thing.' And the world has been growing ever since.

Unfortunately, due to the polish origins (I don't speak Polish) and the fact I joined TES shortly after Morrowind's release, and the Witcher during the seconds 360 release, I don't know as much about The Witcher's backstory. However the depth of the world can be seen as thus; one is aimed at gamers. At the time of Arena's release this was a bunch of teenage boys. The Witcher however aimed immediately at a more adult market, went into the world darker and with a more likeable protagonist. (The world only shines as bright as it's protagonists). 

So if you want to compare each world as a whole, the political intrigue, character division, and depth of the beasts lends The Witcher strong marks. TES draws far too heavily on medieval England, and populates its world fairly predictably. I would have to go with The Witcher.

However if you were implying to only question the *game* worlds of Skyrim vs The Witcher continent as seen through their flagship games - you would have to go Witcher also. This is however an unfair question given the years between releases. 

Skyrim set out to do something fantastic, and it did. It remains one of the best fantasy RPG games of all time. It might still hold the mantle (DA:Inquisition turning into something of a colossal disappointment). And Wild Hunt has the technology (and brilliant studio) behind it to really push the boundaries of what they can do. The world is more alive and aesthetically stunning. Skyrim I felt was better to explore - you were more likely to come across something you wouldn't expect to. Whereas in the Witcher - Geralt's entire mode of life is to find and kill monsters, which takes a sheen off finding and killing monsters when you approach it with a calculated, almost contrived mindset. 

Having said that, I would much rather explore the world of The Witcher - not just for it's aesthetics, but for the people, the fantastic monsters, the quests that are more than just 'kill, x 10' (though those do exist).

So yeah, I didn't expect this to be so one-sided when I set out. I though I would back TES far more than this, but, hands down, The Witcher.

Having said that, let's see what Fallout 4 produces. Which will give us a neat idea of what the next installment in TES will be. Bethesda are one of the best studios going and I trust what they produce to be excellent.

<TEXT> So a question I came up with, that I like to ask people:

You have the choice to undergo a procedure to get superpowers. The chances of it working are slim, and, if it doesn't, you'll die horribly and slowly of radiation poisoning. So - is it worth the risk?

1) You don't get to choose the superpower. It could be anything. It could be great (super speeds, flying) it could be crap, like controlling cheese or something.


2) You can't kill yourself if the procedure fails. You have to suffer. That's the point.

Dying a slow and horrible death worth even the slightest possibility of gaining superpowers? Let me know. </TEXT>

But now I'm scared to quit unless the game throws me back a few hours. Every solution to the issue seems to risk losing my entire save file and the hours I've put into the game already.

Anybody else ran into this issue? Apparently it's not just affecting the Xbone but PS4 and PC as well - though the PC fix seems easier and more likely to not mess up the game.

I mean, otherwise a really excellent game. Cheer me up, gamers =[ </TEXT>

<TEXT> Kvothe is one of, if not the, most compelling characters I've ever read. You haven't met Ambrose yet but when you do, you'll loathe him just because Kvothe does. When Kvothe doesn't succeed, I've never felt so bad for any character, nor wanted one to succeed just so much. Rothfuss does a brilliant job of making you sympathise with Kvothe on a really human level. And that is excellent.

But yeah, mostly he is an utter badass. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Biggest hurdle will be not having anything to offer.

Can you design, or draw or program? Perhaps an internship is the best way to go. The industry is so damn saturated these days that you need to be above the best to even be considered. 

UE4 is a great way to go, and learning on your own is rewarding. But difficult. Ridiculously difficult. I tried it. Programming is hard, and modelling is hard, and GUI and sprites and textures are hard.

It's a lengthy process but one of the most rewarding you'll ever do. Just gotta stick at it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To me his emotional growth was spearheaded by the *other charlie*, and that his own emotional growth was subdued, especially compared to his intellectual growth, by his traumatic childhood experiences. His emotional growth wouldn't have been so impeded were it not for his childhood trauma, and how it came to him so slowly, piece by piece so he could never come to terms with it in one go. That kept his emotional level at that of a child, far more than his intellectual growth. Emotionally he was at the point where he could sleep with Fay, but due to *other Charlie*, he couldn't sleep with Alice. 

I read the last fourty of thirty pages in one go, so I got pretty much the events leading up to his decline, and the decline itself in one go. When his sentences fell apart, and his spelling decline, that when it really hit me. Harder I thought than it was going to, because everyone saw that coming. It was just before the decline when he said he could never go back to being, as he put it, retarded. And then during his decline he said was much happier in his current state, that was what got me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I felt a good takeaway from the book was actually about introversion. For a book about a super-genius it was about 100% more existential than I thought it would be. 

But yeah, particularly towards the end the book took a pretty dark turn, and it did bottle-neck the message into: stay stupid; stay happy. 

But the book was really only about Charlie, I didn't perceive it as an allegory for anything, I never read through it thinking there was a message it was trying to get across. It was a ride, and a good one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depends if you want to live-stream it via twitch or make a let's play YT channel.

As far as live-streaming go, there's really no reason not to stream live from the Xbone, it cuts out the middle-man (PC) and is just nifty and a lot more stream-lined, with faster streaming speeds, which means higher quality.

Capturing it is another story. There really isn't any way to do it other than with a capture card (heretofore called CC). CC's can cost a fair bit of money, but you do, of course, get what you pay for. Like I said mine was 100 but is one of the best on the market. Especially for the new generation, like the Xbox one. 

If you give me an idea of the kind of format you're going for - what you plan on doing. I can give you an idea of the best way to do it, if that helps. 

If I'd have stuck with it however my plan would have been to stream and LP both. Stream games that are more drop-in-drop-out. Games on COD, silly run-throughs, shorter, possibly indie, games. And then do YT LP's of the more serious plays, the story driven games, or the longer ones. I suppose the plan was to create a larger fan base, and, of course, play as many games as possible, and get the most from each one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Live streaming from PC? *OBS*. Easy to use and connects straight to Twitch account. There is also *Xsplit* but that isn't as recommended. 

Of course Steam has its own streaming now, so you can use that.

From consoles? The new generation (Xbone, PS4) have twitch apps you can download and stream straight from console, all you need is internet and a mic. Kinect can also be used as a cam if you want (I assume PS Move can too). 

From older consoles? You might need a capture card. I own the *Game Capture HD*. The card itself cost me 100 quid, but the program to stream is free. Comes with all the necessary cables and works with every console I've tried it on, which is everything but the Wii U (though it does have issues with PS3). Also, it should work fine with the Wii U, I just haven't tested that one out yet. There are cheaper alternatives. 

Ah...I think that's everything covered. 

Of course then it comes down to production values. I have used a Guitar Hero Mic plugged into my laptop, and that worked fine, better than the built in one. But if you want to look pretty, I recommend a decent webcam and mic. They can be somewhat cheap, depends what you want. 

Editing is also super easy these days. But if you, again, want the professional sheen I recommend Final Cut Express. It's pretty much iMovie or Windows Movie Maker but a bit hyped up. It's approaching professionalism. A little bit more pristine is Final Cut X, but that'll set you back more than a bit. iMovie and WMM do the job fine, and to start out with, they're perfect.

As for content; that's down to you. There are plenty of guides out there. </TEXT>

Eh...probably spoilers.

You know, I'm pretty ok with reading about torture. But I guess it was just so casual in this case. The rat and the cheese and the pipe (if you've read it - you know what I mean).

But what got me most was when he killed the dog. I think it's a human thing to dislike cruelty to animals (it's why dogs rarely, if ever, die in films). But Bateman killed that dog and his owner didn't even realise and when he did he was so upset. I mean - he didn't have long to be upset but still. I just went and gave my dog a big hug :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> The thing about the possibility of life is you have to consider the countless billions of *tiny* things that came together to make life on earth possible. And then there's the big things. A planet colliding in earth, breaking off the crust which formed the moon and threw us onto our axis. If Saturn wasn't where it was we might have been wiped out by an asteroid millennia ago. And then there's the small things. Countless small things. Billions. The size of the earth. The distance from the sun. The amount of water on the earth. If any of these things were out by 5% life on Earth could not exist. 

Billions.

But then consider that there are *billions of* **galaxies** *each with* **trillions** *of stars and potential planets.*

The universe is simply too large, and there are too many things out there for life somewhere else to be *impossible*. I find the idea that the exact same conditions couldn't have been replicated ludicrous. There are enough galaxies for there to be thousands of earths, and millions of planets with alien-species nothing like humans, living on planets nothing like earth.

Yes there is life out there. It can't be any other way. </TEXT>

So, if you're British, what do you think sets us apart from other countries?

If you're not British, what do you think sets us apart from your country, that you do differently to us? And not just the base stereotypes, we're not all goofy, monocled gents.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sometimes perhaps it's best not to prioritise writing. Perhaps it's best to take a break from writing, take a step back and collect yourself and your thoughts. Just read, or watch something, just do something easy. Stick to your exercise, but if you find that writing is inducing more migraines, best not to push it. 

Of course if you do want to push it, and writing might make it better, I find goals don't help. Sensible goals or not, you don't always make them. I find it's best to just try and sit down, write for as long as you can until you've had enough, and be happy with whatever you've written. After all it's something, a paragraph is better than nothing. 

Like I say: Progress for its own sake. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Someone who *actually writes*, and writes consistently. 

It's true there are a lot of people who research and plan and they talk a lot about writing, and they imagine they are a writer, yet they get surprisingly little *actual writing* done. I've met people like that. 

You don't have to write well, or be published, or for anyone to read it. Just write consistently, whatever you can and whenever you can. I think that's all there is to it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got out of a long term (5 year) relationship a few months ago. It was a massive adjustment to lifestyle. 

I suppose you just gotta make it through the week. If you can postpone the official, end-all conversation till then, more's the better. Unless you just wanna get it over and done with, of course, which is understandable.

And people change, no doubt about that. I've got a lot of memories of my ex, we did a lot of things together (both our 18's and 21st, first-time holiday abroads, etc), but there's someone else out there who's worth more than that. I heard something once, which I hold on to; there's someone out there making memories right now that they will later share with you, when you're together. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whatever Indie scene (game, movies) I really have never minded supporting it. I would feel happier paying your 25 or my 16 into the Indie world than into Hollywood. (Having said that, the AAA game industry is heading down hill).

I expect Cineworld do. There's a premium of about 2-3 extra for 3D and glasses purchase on top so that's a bit of a rip-off. But at least the more people who use cards, the more they *know* for certain they will take in each month. The cinema trade - another business I don't mind supporting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I heard someone say on the internet before that love wasn't worth it, why would you want the pain? And the heartbreak? I said why wouldn't you? Why would you want to feel nothing? And go through life hollow? Why wouldn't you want to feel pain? I would rather feel pain than nothing at all.

Savour the end of a thing. Embrace that you're about to start a new chapter in your life, and - for better or worse - that's pretty exciting. Just remember that for all the pain, at least it's something, at least it's a drive to move you forward and keep you going. It's just about the fight. 

Pain makes life worth it. Not just because without it happiness is meaningless. But because it's separate, and it owns itself.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have the Cineworld card - I pay 16 a month, and then make sure I get my monies worth. At 9 a ticket, I only need to see two films to make that worth it. Which for me is no challenge.

The thing about where your money goes depends on where the movie came from. Let's accept the majority of movies come from Hollywood, and screw them - they're rich enough. Look at Indie films, or British films, and devise how much money goes to them. They tend to get limited releases, and odds are they paid a lot of money to get that film into cinema. 

Honestly, it's hard to say where the money goes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Might I recommend a different way to edit? Go through it now just for grammar. Nothing big, just the odd run-on sentence, and a few misplaced comma's, small, grammatical errors that are nonetheless important. You want these things fresh in your mind to edit them, so they make sense how you want them.

After that, give it *at least* two weeks. More is better. You want to be as far away from the novel as possible for when you edit. And after that time, you'll be glad you cleaned up the grammar because it suddenly makes a *lot* more sense. Which is good because hopefully you've forgotten about most of the novel from your separation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because there was only so many races. Men, Dwarves and Elves. 

As far as the rings of power go, the One Ring doesn't count. The others were created by Celebrimbor but the one ring wasn't. 

I expect Tolkien had a very specific reason, and it most likely died with him. 

Also; there was more than three races of elves. The rings were made before the Third Age, so before the obvious division of the Elves (Lorien - Galadriel. Mirkwood - Thranduil - and Elrond.) When the rings were made the houses of elves were crazy everywhere. There were 5 families of dwarves to begin with, and they remained the most popular. Durin (the line of Thorin in the film and book versions of the hobbit). And men had pretty much been devised into Numenor. Though that race was split into two. Sauron does gloat however that of the 9, 3 were Numenorean lords.

It might been a display of power. The Elves were the most powerful, and it would have been risky to control too many. This is less true for dwarves, and really not at all true for men. </TEXT>

At the centre of every galaxy, including ours is a *super massive black hole*. That's why galaxies have such bright centres, stars are being pulled in. Of course, we can't see black holes, so how do we know there's one at the centre? There are stars that we can observe moving at impossible-to-fathom speeds, being flung around a single point. There's nothing that can move such a large, dense star, unless it is a super massive black hole. And the star is being slingshotted around it. </TEXT>

Cleopatra lived closer to time of the moon landing than the building of the great pyramids.

Recently (unless it was a hoax), a new *biggest-thing-in-the-universe has been discovered. Previously it was the *Sloan Great Wall* - a cluster of super galaxies stretching 1.2 billion light years across. (No, you cannot fathom how big that is). Recently, the Hercules borealis wall (or similar name) was discovered, a cluster of super galaxies measuring **10 billion light years across**. Why so significant? Because in a universe *supposedly* no older than 14 billion years old how can something have become so large? The discovery of something so big could totally change how perception of the age of the universe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I spent a year editing my own novel, read through it and edited it more than ten times. I was pretty damn thorough. And it's vastly changed, almost all of it. And I like the beginning, and it works well. But when I get to reading the end the difference in style and how much of a better writer I am at the end is so noticeable. I don't notice a sudden change half-way through the novel, or anything like that. It's a smooth flow. I actually quite like seeing how I had grown over the three years it took to write. Like a growth chart.

I mean, the book is shit, but at least I have visible proof it made me a better writer. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Into my sister's room is it. 

It's not very small either. Thick and black and just sat there, on the floor. I had planned on trapping it under a bowl for the night, but couldn't even approach it to place said bowl. Far too risky. And I don't want to sleep in there with it either. So...here I am. If I hadn't stayed up *tonight* and tried to finish my book this wouldn't be a problem.

Christ, I hate spiders. Oh, my fear of them isn't normal. It surpasses plain phobia. I really, *really* need to see a doctor.


Edit: IT IS HERE. IT HAS FOLLOWED ME! IT HAS SMELT AND SEEKS MY FEAR!

It came out onto the landing. I stared at it for a while, watching it, as it circled around and came closer to my room. I threw a show at it to little effect, and when I tried to step on it, deciding to act rashly rather than further succumbing to fear, it ran away. I screamed as it ran off, hiding now in my sister's room where I won't follow it. I could cover the bottom of the door, securing it, but not without risking the thing running out whilst I do so. That would too close. Now I am shaking, sat here watching my sisters door for it to return so I can end this. It is 12:30PM. I have work at 9. I am shaking from fear. I won't sleep with it still alive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I woke up this morning thinking *"Right, time to kill of my 7-year old sister,"* and when I read what I had wrote about her that hit me. 

The best line I've ever written is six words, and hits me everytime I read it. (It's the very last line in my novel, no you can't read it :D).

But someone said "No surprise to the writer, no surprise to the reader. No tears from the author, no tears from the reader." What you feel, the harder bits to write, put that into your writing, emote, and it will make it all the better. Part of being a writer is utilising that. If you feel for your characters, the audience will. If you don't care about your characters, how can you ask an audience to?

<TEXT> I found that writing a short story in the same universe as my own novel was a huge help. Almost to the point where parts of my book *couldn't* exist without it. It was vital. 

If you're struggling to write, write a short story, then if you drop it, it doesn't matter so much. You can evaluate your strengths and weaknesses, and get a feel for your world. 

Writing is just that. Writing. It's enduring the worst day and sitting your ass down and writing. It's realising that inspiration and motivation are entirely *useless*. You will never be inspired or motivated to write, but you just gotta do it. There's nothing more to it. Sitting down and let the words flow.  </TEXT>

That's just the appreciation of literature. But, of course, it is all terrible without editing.

I edited my own novel for a year. That included removing 18k words and reading it over more than ten times. Three times out loud in its entirety. That sure as hell put me off editing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would recommend whatever works for you.

I find that whenever I'm not particularly in the mood to write I just sit down. And three sentences in I'm lost. People always complain about writer's block without even trying to do anything about it. Just sit down and write and once you've got a little bit down you'll get lost in the story, and then that's it, you're writing. 

If you're only writing novella's there's no pressure to write a lot at all because it won't take as long to finish. If you feel happier just sitting down writing no more than 300 words, that's fine. If you want to write one hundred, and take a break and write another hundred, do so. If you sit down for a while and stop and realising your approaching 1k, I wouldn't be surprised, but that's great. Do whatever is easiest. If you want to try for a larger amount, but can't reach it, be happy with whatever you've done. And strive for a little less tomorrow. Or push your damn hardest to reach your word-goal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally I dislike prompts. They're never your own ideas, and they're never as good as anything you could come up with; if not by virtue of being purely *your own.*

Yes, I recommend loose planning. A solid direction to go with enough room for your characters to breathe. However, if your characters go off the rails, follow them, don't ever bring them back. Just follow it through. Eventually it will lead back to a major event. I introduced an entirely new character this way who didn't exist until the moment my other two characters stumbled across him - he just appeared to them and to me - and he was pivotal in the final scenes. It really changed the whole book and for the better just because he was in it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't read Japanese novels I'm afraid. I did read The Buried Giant, by Ishigurio, but that doesn't really count does it? Though it was a decent read. 

But they aren't really those kind of spirits. I've tried my best to keep them separate so they are purely my own spirits and they adhere to the fictional rules of a fictional religion I have full control over. It's important to the story. And though I have in some cases constrained myself with my own rules, I need to know how they work, because I have to keep tabs on the effect they have on the characters. 

However, Japanese culture and spirits are something really interesting to me and I will look into those two authors, if you have recommendations... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, inspiration is almost wholly useless. If I'm not inspired at the beginning of a story I won't write it down. Inspiration will take me through maybe 3,000 words. I think in one case it got me to 8,000 before I lost interest in it. 

The trick is to write without inspiration or motivation - they're both too fickle to be trusted. Those few ideas you get, see them through to the end. If you don't get a lot of ideas, make the most of the ones you have. Push through them without inspiration. That's the best thing you can do. It's the only way to finish anything really. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Try writing something short. It's a really good skill to get the context of a situation in just that situation alone. If you want to write a certain scene that's more interesting to you, then do it. To conjure up smaller scenes and see if they can come together is basically how everything I write begins. This novel was three small ideas, and then I had a big idea and then I worked the smaller ideas into the big idea and brought them all together. That's just the second stage in the idea process. 

For my first novel I didn't organise. I had an idea of the major events and just drove my characters into those events. I didn't like planning because thinking up what happens next is much more exciting, because I know only as much as the characters do what happens. Because of that, and a lack of plan, the novel went off rails and finished at the 125k words mark. 

This novel I've planned out, though somewhat loosely, and allocated each part 30k words - 90k altogether, which is a much better place to stop a novel. To organise this I simply wrote down my ideas into a pad. I wrote a short story set in the same universe, revolving around the spirits, and a lot of the religion came from the ideas I got whilst writing that short and that religion was monumental in planning the novel. It was just back and forth a lot on a notepad. Filling in plot-holes, creating character arcs, looking at a wide overview and fixing any issues. Whilst trying to take the characters into the best, and most interesting, places. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No. But a fictional and extinct religion does exist in my book. It plays a super important part. And the rules that governed the religion (and therefore spirits) I had to set up before I could properly work out what happened in the book. Any time I made a step forward with the fictional religion was a huge break-through in the story.

But real religions, no. I wouldn't anything I wrote to be seen as an allegory or a message involving religion, that's not what I write about. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But you don't want anyone reading your first draft. You want to make a manuscript as polished as possible before anyone reads it. Just so your feedback isn't just warning you about issues you could already have edited out; that renders the feedback wholly useless. There's different stages, and editing without any external influence is one of them, and followed immediately by getting someone else to read it.  

If you can convince someone to read your work and look at it the right way - an overall view rather than a view critical towards style, then you might be ok.

<TEXT> It's really become an archetype now that we readers of high-fantasy (mostly) want long series. They prefer reading a longer book.

Publishers prefer series. They're more likely to gain momentum (and therefore money). It's a safe gamble that if a person likes the first book they will read the rest of the series. More money for publishers, more sales for authors.

Also the whole world-building thing everyone else mentioned. 

Mostly, I think, because scale and epicness can't be measured in a single novel, or two. Harry Potter uses all 6 books to lead us to the intense finale. Who hasn't enjoyed seeing Westeros unfold tale-by-individual-tale? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This just shows that you're writing normally, and, as mentioned, you are taking it seriously. If you weren't questioning yourself, and thinking you were doing badly, you wouldn't be writing properly. That's how it is. You're like me, like a lot of writers. You like having written, but you don't like writing. Your friends sound like they enjoy writing but fuck 'em, everyone writes differently. Everyone writes different things and to get different things out of it. It doesn't matter. Stop talking to them. You're writing and if you're not writing by yourself then you fail at it by default. Writing is inherently lonely, and I'm not saying that to sound angsty, I'm saying it because I know the best way to get anything is done is to not get distracted by, or involve, anyone else. 

No one expects your novel to be a grown up. It's a first draft, it is a baby. *Do not ever expect anything else*. You are not a good writer. You write for infants. And you **edit** your book into adulthood. First draft is gunna be crap. Second is only marginally better. I worked on my own novel for an entire year and went through more than ten drafts (I could have shot myself). Parts of it are unrecognizable from the original and that is such a good thing I can't even tell you. 

Writing isn't easy, you just gotta sit down and do it, take breaks if you want, though I'm sure you feel they are anti-productive and therefore undesirable. So just write, push through it. If it feels like you're writing shit, that's fine. If it's slightly better - but still shit - that's even more fine. It's gunna be shit until you edit it into oblivion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The ability to self-evaluate can't be understated. Eventually you're going to want people to read it over and evaluate you work for you. Getting an opinion other than your own is above essential. The thing is a lot of your flaws you might work out naturally. A lot of your writing flaws you might edit out - and that's what editing is for. 

Like Stephen King said - "write with the door shut. Edit with the door open." 

My advice is to continue working until your manuscript is as perfect as you think it can be. Any weaknesses you feel are in it, address them as best you can. If you don't, any feedback will be just to tell you to fix things you could already have fixed, rather than any issues you actually have in your writing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's the thing, if we advise you to do one, and you try and write it, but aren't convinced you wanna write *that one*, you won't write it.

Write all three. Bring them all together. The last two could stand as a single-plot on their own. If you make the society perhaps dystopic it's not too hard to put in some time-travel there as well.

I'm not going to give you ideas, that's cheating. If you want to write professionally idea generation is a massive part of that. It's not just the genesis of the idea or conjuring up the opening paragraphs. It's coming up with the entire novel and it's a skill that comes with practice.

Of course, if you're not writing professionally ignore my advice. Almost all of my advice tends to be geared towards people who write seriously, rather than just as a hobby.  </TEXT>

Had licked my conscious desire;

And I knew that in that one, tiny

Infinitesimal, minute moment

I could be more than this.

Oh, but still

My dreams

Have foreseen.

And not this, 

Hollow

Impassioned

Being

Of caged-fire

And dewy eyed

<TEXT> So. We are meeting again,

You. You who still haunt my

Every waking hour

To you I am to blame

For this shell I call home.

For whom I blame for this neglect, destitution.

I am a man.

I am a boy.

I am a human.

I am everything you

Should have known

You would leave me as.

You who are so bitter

So spiteful, you who would

Break skin for the malevolence,

For the colour; blood.

And unto me you left this

Learners scar, 

So you could be a poet.

I am a poet,

You are a fool.

You are a child, you are

The neglectful little malignance

That is the abode of my every whim,

You are the little malicious 

Greed that left me to thirst

As you fed this fire.

This pen wouldnt fit so 

Perfectly

In my teeth if you hadnt

Shown me how to hold it.

You are not a man

You are not a boy

You do not consider yourself human,


You are an object,

Arent you?

To which your derision is 

Well with no bottom.

They always seemed justified to treat you 

differently.

And you are the bitter 

Little worm,

As I am the bitter 

Little snake.

As you were so drowned in your self-pity.

I am still wet from your 

Macabre, oh-so philosophical 

Insights.

Shallow as a piss puddle

If you must.

The puppet on the strings

As you were,

But I see that not.

God I hate you,

I hate

I do not hate those scars

On your arm,

Not so much as

Your fathers disappointment,

But a lesson you taught

Yourself

Well.

How alive we are.

Just you and me.

I am the form you wish you had,

But having said that

There will be more poems

To come.

<TITLE> You know what really annoys me about the YA genre? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-12 18:54:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> How the majority of YA books have to have some reference to 'The Hunger Games'. Fuck off Hunger Games, those books were terrible. What was a fantastic YA trilogy? The Maze Runner. Let me just go over to my copy: *"A must for fans of the Hunger Games"*. The Hunger Games wishes it could be half as good as The Maze Runner. Westerfelds *Uglies*: *Before the Hunger Games there was...*. Because even a book published before THG still has to live up to it. 

So it's not so much the books as the covers. I just dislike that a book can't stand on it's own merits, it has to be likened to something else which is, in this case, **vastly inferior**.

(Yeah, ok, I really, **really** hated the last Hunger Games novel.)

But it's true with any trend. Any book that becomes popular others have to try and steal that glory. I just want good books to stand on their own merits and not have to attempt to steal the fame of others. It's cheap. 

I'm sure there are more examples but I can't think of 'em right now.

tl;dr: when book covers reference whichever series is the most famous right now. I hate it.

<TITLE> Whether or not to attempt to publish </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-11 13:55:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's a difficult thing spending four years on a novel and then, at the end of it, stepping back and realising it's probably, most likely, kinda, just a bit shit. 

It is my first novel, and I've spent about a year editing it, but no one else has actually read it, which I know is a huge flaw. But is it worth attempting to publish it if I feel this way. Traditionally publish I mean - sending it out to agencies to seek representation. Worth it just in case? Or not all, shove it in a drawer and forget about it?

I'm not scared of rejection, not at all. That isn't the case. If I decide to at least try, then rejections will just be a part of that, I accept that. It's more about how I feel towards the novel. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why do you think Neil Gaiman's books are so popular?

His writing style? Content? Imagination? Worlds? What made him so astronomically popular, in your opinion?

And I do just mean his writing, not so much his Twitter or Sandman series. I just mean his novels and short story collections.

<TEXT> So I'm planning on starting a let's play soon. I can record output from consoles, and record film. What I can't do however is sync up video from a DSLR to video-game footage. Any hints about how to go about doing this?

Note: Recording from consoles, anything used to record from computer can't be used. I have software to record from console, but no way to use an external camera with it.

I don't want to use my webcam, because I have a HD DSLR I would rather use. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've always shunned books on how to write. My thoughts on this have always been: "A book can't teach me how to write. The only way to get better at writing is by writing. And all the time I've spent reading, I could have spent actually writing."

But I'm starting to think otherwise. Is it ever worth reading a book teaching you how to write? If so, recommend some. I'm really considering it.

<TEXT> Finally defeated Father Gascoigne. Even though he slaughtered countless times (I spent all day on it yesterday) that was still *such* a good fight. So few games get me feeling so tense, sitting up nose to the screen, got his beast form to a slim amount of health, and so *close*. Got him in the end. First time I tried today. Obviously just needed a break.

Now - back to shitting myself exploring previous unexplored territory.

<TEXT> My intention is to write a blog post - or, more likely, a series of blog posts - focusing on writer's block. Breaking it down, understanding what causes it, and, ultimately, how to solve it - in as much as that is possible.
I can only rely on my own closed opinion of writer's block to formulate theories, and that won't do. So I'm looking to crowd source opinions and get as much information from as many people as possible.
In general, just tell me about your experiences, but I also want to know what you think it is, how you suffer from it, how often, how it affects your work, and what you do to get over it? </TEXT>
