<TEXT> Well known? Maybe. Accessible to all types of folks across socioeconomic levels (below mid-middle class [making a distinction between various levels of middle class]), I highly doubt it.

As conservative as this article is, it brings up another good point.

Poor people can't pay toll violations. Rich people can. Rich people also fund these toll road projects with investment and government subsidies.

<TEXT> Sobriety is "not" something to promote... people that want/need to quit weed need to find out about a community somewhere...

I disagree, but completely respectfully. Addiction is scourge on our world, and people need a way out. A community does that.

As for what normies do? I could give two shits. Half my family smokes weed and they handle their shit fine. Legalize it for all I care. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So... here's one.

I take a toll road sometimes. But in order to do that, I have to sign up for a pass online. The pass has an infered signal that tracks when i use the toll road and charges me either per month, or everytime I use it. Also, I don't have to have the pass in my car. My car is registered online.

If you don't have the pass, a computer, and a debit/credit card, you kind of can't drive on the same toll road as me. There are no coin machines or employees. It's all electronic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to be addicted to... and you may not believe me.... but weed.

Smoked about 5 years since turning 18. Was sloppy. Not productive. Desperate. Ended relationships, friendships, and ties with family in pursuit to get high. Almost went to jail a few times. Contemplated prostitution. Pretty familiar with CraigsList. I sadly could go on and on of the terrible decisions I made. To quote MC Chris, "Weed is by my side, it's always been there."

Been sober almost 2 years now. Sobriety isn't for everyone. It's kept me sane.

<TEXT> Here's our story...

I had an OK cupid account, and in my bio I wrote about dog grooming/breeding and the conservation of endangered species, two things I care deeply about. So he messages me:

"Tell me about how you would groom a panda."

He's cute enough, so I do. I tell him about their habitat, their thick coats, their behavioral tendencies in capitivity, animal husbandry, etc.

He's dumbfounded and we make little banter after that.

Fast forward three weeks... I'm sitting in English class, and I see him on Scruff, but I didn't put two and two together, I hardly remember talking to him on OkCupid. We talked for days straight.

So we agreed to coffee. I looked like a disheveled mess with all my books and notebooks for school. He thought it was weird that I called him versus texting him about a change of coffee shop.

It was an awkward first date, I was head over heels for him, he was mildly interested but needed me to wow him.

We were saying our goodbyes, he said he was sure we'd just be friends until he saw me lean on my car, like in the movies. One leg on my car, one on the ground, confident. 

He asked me for a kiss right then and there. </TEXT>

I also saw roofs so thick that explosives used to not penetrate them, bomb shelters every 10 yards, 18-22 year old military members on constant patrol, fences and concretes walls not to block out the Palestinians, but to stop snipers. 

They live on the edge of oblivion for the Jewish people to have one country. One home. One place to raise a family that is their own. 

I don't know how this centuries old situation will work out, I just pray peace comes soon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes! The Incan orchid! Such a beautiful dog breed, though if you are to get one, only use positive reinforcement, as both breeds can be quite sensitive to negative tones and volumes. Very intelligent and intuitive breeds. They are warm and soft to the touch, requiring sun screen, sweaters, constant water and yearly vet visits to limit skin damage. Loss of teeth is quite common, as is acne and skin cancer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you disagree with the idea of AKC purebreds, look in to landraces and pariah dogs. They are bred for job and function, and not appearance. Bali street dogs, Canaan Shepherds, Central Asian Shepherds, Armenian Gamprs, etc.

Surprisingly, Russia is and has been on the forefront of good dog breeding in this regard. Form AND function. Not cuteness and marketability. 

These ridiculous American designer dogs and overbred AKC dogs will be the down fall of respectable dog breeding.

<TEXT> Just brush your cat. Honestly. That's all the issue is. If the groomer sees a matt, they can shave it out.

Whether your cat is happy or not is sheer anthropomorphism. Aside from hormone levels, you'd have no idea. 

All this aside (which I am right, I see it everyday), it probably doesn't matter anymore, because your cat's coat is at this point trashed and unsalvageable, like a blonde that gets platinum hair dyed every single month. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lil Debbie,

I don't know how many other gay men feel this way, but you've been a huge inspiration for me through out the years. It sounds odd, I know, but you just ooze raw empowerment, and don't give no fucks. So thank you so much. You've helped me out of some dark places, and brought up the volume on some of the better times in my life.

Can you discuss some of the writing process, maybe some of the inspiration, for
your album Young Bitch. Since you've released it for free, I've been listening to the entire thing daily. Me and You is like my theme song now.

I really hope you're high as fuck right now. You got mad love coming from the Valley.

Well. Um. Yea definitely gay! Tried the ole' gay to straight conversion therapy out when I was younger, not my cup of tea.

But I appreciate that immensely! Your grandfather was a wise man.

Something my great grandmother once told me before she passed away...

 I lived on a farm in Ohio. We had goats and pigs, chickens and cows, dogs and cats; you should of seen the place, it was beautiful. If I have one regret in this life time, it is not writing about this farm. I always wanted to write a book, at least a diary from that time. I painted it, sure, but I never wrote about it's magic.

I've been writing since then. Sounds like you've lived a life and a half. Could be an interesting read, even if just for yourself years later. </TEXT>

They have high maintenance grooming requirements and need frequent exercising. They are prone to animal and small children aggressive behavior if not properly trained.

They moved their website, but i can assure you the breeders are still there. They land sled run their dogs near Ortega Highway in San Juan.

<TEXT> That's actually not true? Some of the best breeders for siberian huskies live in San Juan Capistrano, CA. They get groomed regularly, are constantly hydrated, and exercise daily.

EDIT: Another great breeder for malamutes lives in Simi Valley, CA. But please, I'd love to see actually scientific, scholarly, peer reviewed sources to back up your claim. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dachshunds, corgis, basset hounds, chihuahuas, shibu inus, they all make the list of cry babies and nightmares.

Huskies, which are my favorite breed (my dad used to breed them, and they currently have one), are bad. I've had every bodily fluid on me from a husky. They are wild, dramatic, territorial, touchy, judgmental, and of all the dogs to groom, they are my favorite. It's like an adrenaline rush, will I die? Will I get mauled? Will I get bit? Or will I get cuddles? Who knows hahaha 

Edit: one of my favorite haircuts to do are schnauzers and wheaton terriers. Both difficult dogs to deal with at times. </TEXT>

Another source: I groom dogs for a living! The hair usually grows back, but after a few repeated 'summer time' clips, will never look the same. These breeds were meant to have long coats. Blowing out the undercoat with a force dryer (which your groomer can do) or just providing some routine good ole' brushing should do the trick! Plus, it'll get rid of all that shedding. (Shaving a dog won't, it will just make the shedding hairs smaller)

EDIT: I've also have owned siberian huskies my entire life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do groom dogs, yes.

What i tell my clients? Brush the dog once to twice a week, for your dog I might suggest a slicker brush, Amazon has a wonderful one called Miracle Brush, I love it. For dogs that shed, horse racks are good or furminators, though I'm careful with those as they cause brush burn.

Bathing once a month or every 6 weeks helps with smell, making sure the dog is 100% dry after each time they get wet will ensure a good smelling dog. Mold occurs when an undried dog is allowed to naturally air dry.

Brushing would also deal with avoiding mats and plant material in the fur. Also, if you walk in to a grooming salon, they will quickly spot shave mats out for a low, low fee, and it's usually a walk in service, no appointment needed.

Double coated dogs have two coats, a fluffy under coat, and a coarse top coat. The common misconception is that shaving a dog cools them in the summer. This is false. The natural hair actually protects from the sun, and when thoroughly brushed out, allows air to naturally channel through the hair follicles. A common example I give is a german shepherd. When you shave a german shepherd, the fluffy undercoat is typically trapped, creating a webbing affect. As the top coat attempts to grow out, the bottom coat prevents it in certain areas, giving that choppy appearance your pup has. This can also lead to acne, over heating, sun burn, and increased condensed undercoat for micro-organisms to thrive in.

If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. I love helping fellow dog owners out. </TEXT>

Like you sort of said, these are carefully formed flocks, split repetitively to perfect dimensions, allowed to grow out.

If you want to.... not have those... you shave the dog. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not try to remove matting this heavy with a brush or demating tools. That's cruel and causes a lot of pain to the dog.

Your dog has severe matting? Bring them to the groomer or the vet to be shaved down. Then, brush your dog 1-2 times a week. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So as a groomer, I can comment on this...

Bathe them a few times a year. Like 4-6. Each bathing session takes a total of about 12-14 hours (drying included in that). Each flock must be soaped and dried individually for best result. 

If one of the flocks starts to smell of mildew (like an old tent) my suggestion would be to take off that specific flock, though I know groomers that might use tar and sulfur shampoo, a vinegar 10:1 solution, or some Nature's Miracle solution.

Edit: Since a lot of people are asking about the drying process, I found a vet's blog about his Pulis, another corded breed. Here's some of his tips.


The length of time he needs to stay in the dryer will depend on the form of the cords - how densely each cord is packed. Never use heat for drying a Puli. Being strong willed, a Puli is capable of objecting so strenuously to being mistaken for a lobster that he fusses himself into heat stroke, not from the heat of the dryer as much as the heat of his frustration. The safest and most comfortable dryer is as follows:

Build a platform tall enough to set a large (18") high velocity fan underneath.
Obtain 2 fans with a lifetime guarantee - like a Patton fan - and set one underneath pointing straight up. (See why you want that guarantee?)
Place your dogs cage, which should be of the small mesh construction, upside down (if necessary) over a hole cut in the top of the platform, just a bit smaller than the dimensions of the cage. Upside down the pan can be left out without the Puli falling through the cracks!
Place the Puli in the cage and position the second fan in front and at the same level as the cage. Turn on both fans, and retreat from earshot for the appropriate number of hours.
Dont worry about the Puli in this arrangement if the crate is secure on top of the stand and the stand is securely built. I usually do this before bedtime, and leave him in overnight. This is a sufficient length of time to dry most dogs, at least if the wringing and sweatshirting have proceeded as above, and hes usually the most comfortable one in the house; a breeze in his face, white noise, the cage hes used to sleeping in anyway (well, in some cases). If its cool where he is add a commercial dryer on top to slightly warm the air - thats all it will do with an open wire crate and two fans. You really wont endanger your dog with this setup.

You definitely do have to rig up something like this if you are going to keep your Puli in a full corded coat. You may be able to tolerate the smell of your darling if he isnt completely dry, but believe me, no one else will and you will be guilty of smearing the reputation of the whole breed! Could you live with that knowledge? If you dont dry him thoroughly, in 2 or 3 days, bacteria will bloom inside the warm, damp centers of the cords, and your Puli will reek. Itll be much worse than he smelled before the effort and agony of the bath. After youve removed your guy from the drying cage, check him again in a few hours to see if capillary action has pulled moisture out to the dry outer layers from still wet inner layers. If so, in again for another 3 hours or so. He hates it when he reeks and people avoid him, and you will pay for it! </TEXT>

I think I've angrily snapped at like 3 of my friends (not best friends, but friends non the less) and 2 acquaintances.

Maybe it's because I'm not going cold turkey? Maybe it's that i'm using nicotine replacement therapy? (gum) I just can't stop telling stupid bitches off, and it's really hurting the people around me.

All the while my coworkers and boyfriend think I'm doing amazing. They just don't see how my friends see me right now. </TEXT>

Clinical factors associated with rape victims' ability to testify in court: a records-based study of final psychiatric recommendation to court.

http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/L-CJSpoor.htm

 The O.J. Simpson murder trial provided us with a snapshot of a system that is heavily biased towards money -- even more so than race. Without his Dream Team of lawyers, O.J. would have been convicted of murder within a matter of weeks. Indeed, trial lawyers everywhere conceded that death sentences have been handed out on lesser evidence. The counterpoint to this observation is the true-life movie Dead Man Walking. In the movie, white death-row inmate Matthew Poncelet tells Sister Helen Prejean: "There ain't no money on death row." 

 The rich have several important, if not decisive, advantages when it comes to handling the legal justice system. They can afford bail, which allows them to conduct their own investigations and prepare for trial. They can afford better attorneys (by itself an enormous edge), better expert witnesses, better private detectives, better alibis. In fact, rich corporations or individuals often threaten to put up such a huge legal battle that courts often seek to plea bargain away or even dismiss the charges. 

 There are two ways that sentencing is biased against the poor. First, the rich either write or lobby for the very laws that purport to oversee their behavior. Harsh sentences for the poor are softened whenever legislators write them for the rich, even though their crimes may be many times greater. Second, judges have shown themselves reluctant to make common criminals out of the community's best and finest. Both of these biases have created wide disparities in sentencing. For example, millionaire Jack Clark received no fine and only one year in jail for cheating stockholders out of $200 million. Yet in the same courthouse, a minimum wage worker who had stolen $5,000 received four years in prison -- that is, 160,000 times the punishment. (13) 

 A study of federal and state courts found that the poor were not only found guilty more often, but that they were not recommended for probation 27 percent of the time, compared to 16 percent for the upper classes. The poor were also not given suspended sentences 23 percent of the time, compared to 15 percent for the upper classes. 



"Circle-jerk" or not, you live in a fairy tale land. Economic disparity in jail sentencing is a thing.

<TEXT> Hi, thanks for doing this AMA.

I have heard a lot of about the russian bloggers, bots, propagandists, scoring the web for topics on the Ukraine/Russia issue going on (my intense condolences by the way, my prayers have been going out for those suffering these atrocities). 

I was wondering if you believe any of this misinformation is going the other way as well? Ukrainian nationalist in comment sections on news articles marking up facts, etc.

Another question, I've heard of people staying in the worst hit of cities, even after bombings and rocket fire, looting and crime, still staying in their home towns, sometimes even unable to physically leave due to old age, or simply attachment to the towns themselves. When I heard this, I thought the Ukranian government would be making mandatory evacuations, and providing shelter to those displaced (e.g. refugee camps). Are people being helped leaving their towns? Should they leave, and if they aren't, why, other than reasons being speculated? </TEXT>

Shibu Inus are high energy, been used for hunting small game for years. Chows, while not so energetic, definitely have a job. Protecting large spaces, patrolling. 

My siberian husky, similar spitz like mentality, strongly dislikes being constricted, limited in mobility. Even as a dog groomer, I muzzle him start to finish.

The only thing that calms him down, allowing me to man-handle him or put him in any size kennel I want? Exercise. A jerby-jerb. He get's out his 'husky drive', I don't have to deal with his anxiety. Just another idea... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a lot of difficulty socializing and handling stress in a healthy way my first.... pretty much 3 months.

You got some good ideas though! Exercise, MA meetings, prayer, meditation, drinking tons of water, not drinking caffeine or alcohol, all great things that have worked for some people!

I also liked having a creative outlet. I like poetry, personally. So I wrote a lot. Loud music. Playing with neighbors'  dogs. Eating my favorite foods. Sex with my boyfriend all the time (Idk i guess my sex drive came back 100 fold). Channels to move our emotions. Escapism, no. That's what our pot smoking was. This is giving our interests a chance to come back with the weird, awkward 'pink cloud' of the first 3 months.

It's a weird and kind of awesome time.

Mandatory, congrats on being sober! Woot woot! </TEXT>

<TITLE> A little story about a rare breed dog I met at a coffee shop. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-26 22:35:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Spotted a male Romanian mioritic shepherd dog at a coffee shop. I only know this cause the owner told me about his breed history and personal story.

He flew to California on AirFrance from Transylvania. His brothers are herding dogs (this will be an important detail in a bit.) He hates squirrels with a passion, but instead of biting them, he bats them like baseballs with his monster paws.

In Romania, he has three brothers (probably more but the breeder keeps three males). The brothers are raised together with the herder, the flock, and a donkey. The donkey is sometimes the first line of defense from bears and wolves. If the donkey is attacked by a bear, the brothers get in formation. Two brothers will distract the bear by barking and swiping their paws. The third brother will sneak from behind and attack the bear's back legs. This could go on for hours, with the bear then running away, never messing with said flock again.

As the owner was telling me this story in a thick Transylvanian accent, the dog was circling me, he was working me. So cool. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That you are two completely separate people with two different sets of beliefs, opinions, and personalities. I feel like I'm constantly telling my friends (who are in the early stages of a relationship) to be more accepting of their partner. If they want to keep a Grindr profile, that's their deal, not yours. If they don't want to go to church, that's their deal. If they think your brother is a self righteous douche-nozzle, then that's their opinion and you have to respect it.

I don't think I've cried as hard watching something as I've cried watching the footage from American soldiers shot in Germany at a concentration camp. Watching germans pile bodies in to holes. The look of apathy in their eyes. The jews trying to walk to get water, thinner than sticks. Those were my people. They were my blood.

The insect released a chemical that tasted EXACTLY like Big Red. I've been on the search for the binomial nomenclature ever since, as my guide just nick named them 'cinnamon bugs'. 

Habitat: Leaf litter near stream beds and riparian forests.

Size? Color?: Not exceptional large, I believe it was either all brown/tan/patterned, though it may have had red markings.

Any ideas? </TEXT>

<TEXT> so in california, the californian fan palm sheds its fans along side its trunk, like a scarf on a neck. this insulates the tree at night, where temperatures in the desert can drop below freezing. this creates refuge for a plethora of animals that can eat the fruits, carry the seeds, help pollinate the plant, and give nutrients to the soil.

some other cool facts about them, they are exactly the correct height to protect them from columbian mammoths, their top predator, once upon a time. the native americans would seek the trees out, as they grew where the water was. they would burn the dead fans on the trunk to scare all the little animals away (think snakes, mice, spiders, bats, birds, etc.). </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The main difference between animal emotions and human emotions is that animals don't have mixed emotions the way normal people do. Animals aren't ambivalent; they don't have love-hate relationships with each other or with people. That's one of the reasons humans love animals so much; animals are loyal. If an animal loves you he loves you no matter what. He doesn't care what you look like or how much money you make.

This is another connection between autism and animals: autistic people have mostly simple emotions, too. That's why normal people describe us as innocent. An autistic person's feelings are direct and open, just like animal feelings. We don't hide our feelings, and we aren't ambivalent. I can't even imagine what it would be like to have feelings of love and hate for the same person.
Some people will probably think this is an insulting thing to say about autistic people, but one thing I appreciate about being autistic is that I don't have to deal with all the emotional craziness my students do. I had one fantastic student who flunked out of school because she broke up with her boyfriend. There's so much psychodrama in normal people's lives. Animals never have psychodrama.

Children don't, either. Emotionally, children are more like animals and autistic people, because children's frontal lobes are still growing and don't mature until sometime in early adulthood. I mentioned earlier that the frontal lobes are one big association cortex, tying everything together, including emotions like love and hate that would probably be better off staying separate. That's another reason why a dog can be like a person's child: children's emotions are straightforward and loyal like a dog's. A seven-year-old boy or girl will race through the house to greet Dad when he comes from work the same way a dog will. I think animals, children, and autistic people have simpler emotions because their brains have less ability to make connections, so their emotions stay more separate and compartmentalized.

Of course, no one knows why an autistic grown-up has trouble making connections, since our frontal lobes are normal-sized. All we know right now is that researchers find "decreased connectivity among cortical regions and between the cortex and subcortex." The way I visualize it is that a normal brain is like a big corporate office building with telephones, faxes, e-mail, messengers, people walking around and talking -- a big corporation has zillions of ways for messages to get from one place to another. The autistic brain is like the same big corporate office building where the only way for anyone to talk to anyone else is by fax. There's no telephone, no e-mail, no messengers, and no people walking around talking to each other. Just faxes. So a lot less stuff is getting through as a consequence, and everything starts to break down. Some messages get through okay; other messages get distorted when the fax misprints or the paper jams; other messages don't get through at all.

The point is that even though autistic people have a normal-sized neocortex including normal-sized frontal lobes, our brains function as if our frontal lobes were either much smaller or not fully developed. Our brains function more like a child's brain or an animal's brain, but for different reasons.
When the different parts of the brain are relatively separate from each other and don't communicate well, you end up with simple, clear emotions due to compartmentalization. A child can be furious at his mom or dad one second, then completely forget about it the next, because being mad and being happy are separate states. A child hops from one to the other depending on the situation.

You see the exact same thing with animals. Strong emotions in animals are usually like a sudden thunderstorm, They blow in and then blow back out. Two dogs who live together in the same house can be snarling one second, then go back to being best friends the next. Normal people need a lot more time to get over an angry emotion, and even when a normal adult does get over a bad emotion he's made a lasting connection between the angry emotion and the person or situation that made him angry. When a normal person gets furiously angry with a person he loves, his brain hooks up anger and love and remembers it. Thanks to his highly developed frontal lobes, which connect everything up with everything else, his brain learns to have mixed emotions about that person or situation.

Having a vet or a groomer grind your dogs nails is great. Especially since it's behind a wall/door/curtain and you don't know what's going on.

If you can't spend an hour with your dog a day, I can't fathom why you'd have a dog. Champion dogs cost $2,000-$3,000,000 (See chinese bred Tibetan Mastiffs). 

The benefits of long walks are numerous. Better behavior indoors, ample bonding, cardiovascular health for you and your dog, a great way to meet neighbors and other dogs in the neighborhood; I could go on. </TEXT>

I guess I say that because it's a nail grinder. Such as, "Hey Debra, yea we did the blueberry facial scrub and oatmeal shampoo, with medicated conditioner, expressed the anal glands, grinded the nails, and gave him a teddy bear head with a half inch on the body." It's a bad habit.

So thanks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For dew claws, bring them to the groomer. Sometimes they won't even charge you, it's so easy.

If you must do it at home, get a nail clipper [example](http://www.amazon.com/Safari-Professional-Large-Nail-Trimmer/dp/B0002ARQV4), and look at the dew claw closely. If you can see the quick, cut above it. If the nail curves, cut after the apex of the curve, the top of the curve, at a right angle (like 2:00 on a clock). If you cut the quik, don't panic. Use some Quik Stop to cauterize the cut, numb the slight pain, and stop the bleeding by holding on the area with the septic powder for 15-30 seconds. Though the professionals are always best! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yea, the reason I posted this tip originally was that a lot of dogs don't like their feet/paws/nails being man handled. It can be traumatic. I wouldn't say a barbershop and a grooming salon like the one i work in are analogous, because my clients don't speak the same language i do. Most don't know whats going on. Long walks and a little training (touching the paws often, using your cell phone on vibrate on the paws and body) can go a long way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree! It's just not a luxury most people have when we get really breed specific. Ex: Ratting, agility, herding, sledding, swimming. Though they all can be done!

OC, California has a herding pen in... Santa Ana I believe with sheep. San Juan Capistrano has dog sleds for huskies. Tons of agility clubs all around the area. And the beach. For dogs like my lab that love to swim and surf.

But only some activities will wear down the nails. Walking/Running/Jogging will. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It can be for some dogs. If a groomer or vet in the past hit the quik (blood supply) it can resurface past emotions and freak them out. Also, their paws are central in feeling the world around them (Ever hear a dog can 'predict' an earthquake?). Myths aside, they are sensitive areas. I said this in the other post, about 5 in 15 dogs i see in a salon loss their shit. Long walks and a little training prevent that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In a perfect world I completely agree!

Though when you groom dogs, and 5 out of the 15 dogs you groom in a day lose their shit when you trim their nails, I tell my clients to walk their dogs more! Bonding time, cardiovascular health (for both of you), better behaviors in the home; there's tons of benefits to wearing down your little pooch.

Some other tips, play with your dogs feet. Let them know you can touch them. Also, put your cell phone on vibrate and hold it to their paws and body. The buzzing will get them used to clippers and nail dremels. I've seen it work wonders. </TEXT>

As a dog groomer, I get happy when I see a dog walk in to the salon with healthy nails from long walks. It's 15 minutes I don't have to spend doing something most dogs aren't comfortable with. Nothing is worse than nails that are so long, they actually curl in to the pads! </TEXT>

Edit: What would I do if I could financially support a dog(s)? I would buy from a breeder, and make sure I had enough money to continue a blood line. But I'm a groomer, and plan on becoming a breeder. So... our needs differ. </TEXT>

Like I'll teach the new person about our clients and the area (And apparently some of the buyers think I'll teach them how to groom for free?!?!?!?) Also included in this package, are kennels, the tub, a grooming table, dryers, and all of our 6 years worth of clients.

I want to stay. I like the salon a lot, and the dogs we get are amazing. I just don't know what to do. This week, my boss is already packing up her stuff and has a friend that has the key to let buyers come by. So essentially, I don't have a job this week. I'm just going to people's houses that call me. 

With all this in mind, please, please, please, someone make some sense of this situation, any advice would be wonderful. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was in 6th grade. I woke up in the morning and saw my mom crying in front of the tv. She told me I still had to go to school. Everyone was talking about it on the bus. I remember joking about it, making nazi and muslim references to it with a mormon friend of mine.

I got to class and every single teacher had the tv on. If they wanted to do the lecture, they'd just turn the volume off and continue with the lesson. One teacher, being a veteran and having his brother overseas already, scraped the entire lesson and just had us watch the news. He told us on a later day that he would like to put Osama Bin Laden in a chair and have pigs eat him alive, like in Hannibal. 

A few months later, we went toilet papering in our neighborhood. Got the wrong house (we thought it was an acquaintance of ours), but it ended up being a muslim family. Cops were called (I ran). My brother and friends told us the family thought it was a hate crime, some sort of retribution for what happened. My friend (the mormon one) made them cookies, and everyone cleaned up the mess. All was well.

But those were some fucked up times man.  </TEXT>

In that sense, gender and sexuality are two different things. 

It's all really complicated and hard to explain. I might suggest popping in to an AskReddit and be like, "wtf, someone explain this to me." That could be funny.

Edit: Oh, also, genitalia are none of your business. I couldn't think of a nice way to put that, but it's true. I have been put down for asking about that myself. Good way to get smacked. I don't suggest it. </TEXT>

Apparently it looks like LA jail is one of a few that do it at all. And with a few new laws going forward in California about drug related crimes, and segregation based on race (sexuality and gender seem like safety issues to me, but whatever), its really anyone's guess what will happen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, hence the deletion. I'll be civil. 

So before it was more mainstream to be gay, lesbian, whatever, individuals that didn't fit within gender archetypes didn't have the luxury of being in the closet. Men with higher pitched voices, intersex individuals, women that had no interest in feminine things. These people were the first to be out, and were usually ostracized for such. They probably didn't want to 'look' or 'act' queer, because it could mean death, imprisonment, your life getting turned upside down. People within a percentage of our population don't fit gender archetypes, it's most likely a mix of genetics and upbringing. Some parents know their child will end up gay. Some are thrown for a loop.

The world is a funny thing, but it takes all the colors to make a rainbow.

And i was being a dick. So here's my take. My apologies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Nina! Dedicated listener and supporter of my local NPR station (KCLU),

I have a question about same sex marriage. My partner and I are both young, and have been flirting with the idea. When it comes to the news though, we're both extremely confused what's going to happen. Both the states we currently live in have legal same sex marriage, but what court case would take it to the Supremem Court? Why was it such a big deal that the court passed on hearing the case before them?

Again, thanks for doing this AMA! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I simply think too many people are misdiagnosed, or are really addicts, and not suffering a mental disorder, and then some are doing both, and some are neither, just like doing drugs...

And enough is enough. Let's take away a BIG problem, for an entire year, and see what's left, BEFORE we pump people full of pills and put ideas in their head of diagnoses. Maybe? </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me, the hardest time was the first 3 months. I had to understand why they were difficult, so I read a lot of material on withdrawal symptoms. A lot of which can be found on the Marijuana Anonymous website.

Also, out of sight, out of mind. I didn't keep mementos or pieces or pretty bongs.

I drank a ton of water. I limited fatty foods. I kept in contact with people that would support me, and just eventually stopped talking to the ones that rather me just smoke with them. It was less deliberate, and more natural.

I got a job as soon as possible, to eat up my time. I'm already a trained dog groomer, so it wasn't that difficult to find one. Especially since by month 4, I was pissing clean. Problem was, most of my grooming was done high, so their was a bit of relearning to do that I'm still dealing with a year later.

I can't really tell you much what to do, but if you have any other specific questions, I can tell you what worked for me.

<TEXT> You raise an interesting point, taxation and dogs, specifically gun and working breeds.

Back in Europe a hundred or so years ago, working dogs and the sort were not taxed. They had their tails docked to prove it. 'Pet' dogs had full tails, and were thusly taxed.

Modern day licensing has nearly wiped out canine rabies in America, and can be very helpful in returning dogs to owners when lost (micro chipping yeah, but again, not everyone does that). 

I think of it as a dog census. In the grooming world, that break down of breeds that are registered pretty closely matches what I see in the salon. It's good to know what breeds come in in my community to know what tools and the like I'll need to buy.  </TEXT>

Not everyone in LA County, or anywhere, registers there dog. Plenty of reasons. Illegal immigrant, bench warrant, conspiracy theorist, tons and tons of reasons. Also, they don't believe in rabie revaccinations?

Another thing, these least common breeds, are the only one registered in the county. I didn't see that breed but it is most for sure in LA somewhere. Just not on this data sheet of registered list for one reason or another.

Faith? God loves you no matter what. He made you in his image. Period. Not religious? Ignore that.

But just everyday, one best friend after the other, it gets better. People you trust you tell. People that don't need to know, you don't. Most will support you.

Love? When it comes, it'll come. Probably the internet. Scruff, grindr, OKCupid. But not always, as in the words of Frank Sinatra, "Love is a many, splendored thing," and can happen anywhere. Having a network of friends and people you know who are also gay or bi can be a life saver.

Coming out is an everyday process. It is safer in this country then ever before. Our brothers and sisters love us, and it's truly a brighter day.

I'll be rooting for you man.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, very late to the game, but i thought I might throw in a few things about myself.

I was addicted to weed and alcohol... and pills were fun. Mostly weed. 2 rehabs (1 outdoor wilderness), 4 hospital stays, and a host of doctors visits. Compounded with me being gay and lacking common sense, I was a high risk for everything and anything. I was in it balls deep for about... 6 years, with breaks in-between.

I moved with my partner to a new state, created a new hell for myself, went to a hospital (like seriously, being catered to is what gets me off, hospitals, doctors, rehabs are like icing on an awesome cupcake of addiction), and i said enough was enough. I started in a program, left the hospital early, and have been sober for...

...about a year and a few months. I moved from my partner to continue my sobriety and job searching and education and yadda yadda yah adult stuff, but we are still dating, and i'm going to fly out to see him tomorrow.

Weed addiction is a serious, sometimes deadly issue that gets swept under the rug because of how low risk the drug itself is. People don't die from smoking weed, but they sure as hell can ruin their lively hoods. 

Well. That's my $3.50. Hope to strike a chord or two. Cheers.

Edit: My life today! Forgot that part. Well, no medications, pray daily, gainfully employed for most of my sobriety, and have great relationships with family and friends. Still dress like a stoner. It's hard to shake off lazy fashion. </TEXT>

These look like garbage. Put your clipper on low, and train your dog proper. Use a cell phone on vibrate. A back massager. An electric tooth brush. Work up to a clipper on low without using it, just having it on. Baby steps.

Sorry to sound so harsh, but this isn't the victorian age, my dear.

Edit: I have ONCE seen these on a dog grooming group, but no one even used them. They are antiques from a bygone era.

Some times bitches will just not take to the puppy and eat the puppy dead or alive. Mastiffs have a propensity to swollen teets. If a puppy clamps down on one, she could 'disown' her puppy, prey instinct comes in to play, and she will eat her puppy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> YES it's called a [miracle brush](http://www.amazon.com/Miracle-Coat-Slicker-Brush-Large/dp/B000QFQFTY), buy this, it will make your life better.

Also, while you're at it, invest in a greyhound comb. It has two sides. Use the wide toothed side to find matts, which you shave out with a clipper with a #10 blade. The fine toothed side will be used to check your work. DO NOT USE THIS TO DEMATT. Also, DON'T USE SCISSORS TO DEMATT. (I yelled this, I actually yelled this).

Next, for double coated dogs, i use a [Furminator](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040QQ07C/ref=amb_link_411281542_2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER pf_rd_s=center-3 pf_rd_r=1Z56KSWBNPYGAMPQEFR2 pf_rd_t=101 pf_rd_p=1776751902 pf_rd_i=1296335011) and a [Zoom Groom](http://www.amazon.com/Dog-Zoom-Groom-Choose-color/dp/B000RGKU7K). Furminator is a blade. Don't do the same area for too long, your dog will get skin irritation. It gets out the undercoat. The zoom groom is good for top coat, and the dogs love how it feels.

Hope some of this helps.

I would also look in to mobil groomers to come to your house. You may have to drop $100, but it'll be worth it. Promise. We professionals know best. </TEXT>

Think about it this way. 5 people are bigger than 1 person, or higher. This group of 5 people is a bigger 'thing' than yourself. This belief in the bigger group than yourself can be powerful. Group mentality. Faith in something bigger than yourself. It isn't a God, isn't a bunch of Gods, it's a bunch of people.

H.G. Well's 'The Island of Doctor Moreau' and all those movies it got turned in to. - Scientist has an island of human/animal hybrids.

I'm absolutely sure I'm missing some other films.

Also, don't get me wrong. I was pumped about this film for months. I love Kevin Smith, and I'm glad it got him funding for 'Clerks III', so word. I found the film hilarious and sickening at the same time. So many kudos.

My beef? It's not original. It may be funny, it may be unsettling, but it isn't original. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My one year free of weed </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-21 03:21:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's been a crazy ride for sure. I just want to share some of my story and experiences. Maybe some one else went through some of the same things as I did. Maybe you're going through it now.

I started smoking weed at 16, I was a musician so it felt natural. I preferred cigarettes and alcohol, so I never got too sucked in. I crushed on most of the guys I smoked with, they made me feel a false sense of validation. I stopped briefly, and by the time I got to college, I fell in love with mary jane again. Or at least the people passing me the blunt.

One day a friend told me, "Hey man, you know you need to buy a sack at some point, right?" It hit me like a light from heaven; holy shit, I can buy weed. So I did. Again, and again, and again. I couldn't afford college after another year, being out of state, and too depressed to work, so I left. Shit got worse.

I smoked all day, every day. Medical grade, all the time. I went in and out of programs and rehabs, mostly because I liked the alcohol, weed, pill combos. Years went by. I was moving at a snail's pace.

I ended up moving on a whim to another state, and ended up in a shitty relationship in a shitty apartment. Fuck, the weed there wasn't even that great. But I put my game face on, and bought frequently from H dealers. Never any hard stuff. Just weed.

I had an epiphany after I had some money stolen. I invited a bunch of friends over (fitting). We smoked. We drank. We popped pills. And I cried. I cried because I lost not only my money, but because I lost myself. I called 911 on myself, went to a hospital, and left after 3 days.

23, in the middle of a new state, and trying to stay sober, was insane. I couldn't sleep most nights. I stopped drinking caffeine. I was desperate for friends. My boyfriend and I fought constantly. But I kept my goal in mind, just fucking stay sober.

I had the insight to leave the state, and plan my next move. I found a town I liked, with a career program I liked, and moved on in. Still fresh in my absence from weed, I was still overly talkative and couldn't find enough ways to spend my time. Unemployed. Lonely. A mess.

I made friends were I could, kept looking for a job, and prayed. I prayed all the time. Sometimes with other people, mostly by myself. Some people find it weird for an LGBT man to be spiritual, but fuck, that's all I had going. My family slowly starting respecting me again. I got phone calls from people that cared. I was moving forward, and people took notice.

Finally, after all the job searching, I got a job I loved. Soon, a new car. Soon after that, I broke up with my long distance boyfriend, and I was dating normal people again. Things still affect me, but I have the emotional willpower to handle them like an adult. Life isn't so much a roller coaster, more so a stroll over the sand dunes at a beach. Every moment more beautiful than the last, even if I can't see the ocean from my point of view.

I can't really dish out advice. I don't feel like that's my place. I can just share what I've gone through, and it was hell. I wouldn't wish that upon my worst enemy, even if that happens to be me.

Life today is beautiful. And i'm glad to be hear to share it with you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fog rolling over roads so you can't see straight,

Bats clouding out the cave exit a few feet ahead,

Sand storm hitting at 62 miles per hour face first,

A river torrent opposing your swim as you move up stream;

Intangible, it's all just impossible to put my finger on.

I don't even know if our love was ever real.

Maybe it was just all in my head, my weak and fragile head.

Regardless of what I experienced, I walk forward, blinded.

I don't walk back and ask for help, I simply walk forward. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Any one else feel like this?

I slack off on going to meetings and keeping up with my marijuana sobriety, and the guilt just builds and builds until its all consuming and I treat people around my like 'things' and not people.

I had a friend tell me he wanted to relapse this morning because of an exboyfriend he was trying to get in contact with was ignoring him. That could easily have been me. I obsess over people. I try rehashing old relationships and getting butt hurt about it. I just broke up with my ex and now that guilt is building on my guilt of not going to enough meetings.

So I let go. I just go to a meeting. I let go. I go on a date with someone else. I let go. I pray and write poetry. I let go. I write to you guys seeking our shared experiences in marijuana sobriety about what guilt means to you and how you deal with it. 

Thanks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It takes hours to dry a Komondor or Puli (not sure which one it is, my guess is Puli). I've heard about 12 hours. Plus you have to dry each dread individually. Also creating the appearance takes years of parting and maintaining. Once you have the pattern set and each dread about an inch wide, it maintains itself to an extent. They make great herding dogs, especially the black ones, because Hungarian farmers can see them easily inside their flock. They've even been known to jump on the back of the sheep just to get them to move. They're awesome.

As for me? My boyfriend still smokes. It sucks, but I really don't care and he doesn't rub it in my face. He doesn't do it around me, and when we were living together, he had his weed, bongs, and pipes in a separate cabinet that i wouldn't go in to.

Personally? I would not live with people that smoked weed that I wasn't in love with (as in people that I have been inside of, or have been inside of me... American Dad reference...) I know I'm a sucker for peer pressure. "Come on man, do it, do it, you know you love it." "Fuuuuuuuuuck, I do, how'd you know." **BAM** Almost a year down the drain. It hasn't happened. But it could.

<TEXT> Congrats on coming to this conclusion! That's awesome to hear. I'll tell you a few things other people have told me.

If it's fucking you up, don't do it. Weed, alcohol, pills, whatever.

Don't worry about cigarettes. They aren't good for you, they cause health problems; that said, you have bigger fish to fry. Staying marijuana free, money, family, friends; if the future holds you not smoking, then it will happen.

We aren't fortune tellers. We don't know what tomorrow will bring. So brace yourself, and live a single day at a time. Sometimes a minute at a time.

Again, congrats.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Edit: I only identify as a recovering marijuana addict, though I've done other things. I choose complete sobriety of most mind altering substances.

My one year of sobriety is coming up soon. I don't usually open up about my journey too often, but today I had a moment. 
I went shopping for cold medicine, and caught myself actually reading ingredients.

"No, can't buy that for such and such reason."... "No, people get messed up on that"... "No, that'd make me feel weird, forget it"
I realized, not only do I feel like an old person, but I feel like a person that takes personal responsibility for what goes in to my body.
May it be cough medicine, or THC, or vodka, or that one weird pill my friend gave to me in high school at our church small group; sobriety is a complete overhaul of all of your previous beliefs, dispositions, and experiences.

I'm better for it.

With that, I still have no idea how I'm going to celebrate my one year, but I will.

BTW you sound like a champ. So, rock on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From what I've seen of him, this sadly doesn't surprise me at all. The church I used to attend prides itself in being able to speak every language, being able to convert every culture to evangelic christianity. Think of that. Aspects of cultural significance gone for ever, meanings to phrases, prayers, songs, poetry, forever evaporated. Because my religion is right, and your religion is wrong. I wish we could all be right :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm in the, "I don't see why this is a problem" camp.

I groom dogs, and plenty of people bring their dogs in to the salon like this. I wish more would. Dematting a dog is akin to torture, and long haired dogs like Cavilers can easily get dirt, grass, seeds (sometimes growing), twigs, poop, fishing hooks, gum, ect. stuck in their coats. Then we have to shave your dog and get yelled at after.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They could implement dogs on to those farms. Such as the [Anatolian shepherd](http://www.dogwork.com/anatolian-shepherd-cheetah) that has been used in Botswana and South Africa to protect cattle and sheep from cheetahs. These are centuries old techniques that absolutely work.

Wolves were here first. We have to manage our resources responsively. That includes hunting, preservation, reintroduction, and capital gain from our biodiversity and ecosystems. 

As a hunter, think about it. Big game parks, all over the great plains. Coinciding with ranches, state, and national parks. Hunters benefit. Local economies benefit. Tourism benefits. It's a win win for everyone, when done correctly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can you cite a source? I've just never heard of humans successfully replacing natural predators, I could be wrong though.

Edit: And the reason to return these megafauna is to return (for example) the great plains to their natural state. Large animals eat large amounts of plants, which are hunted by large predators, which die off to feed large scavengers. All of which returns nutrients to the soil. VERY, VERY simplified. 

We also have fossil evidence to date a lot of those animals back as well. Pre-humans. As in 13,000 years ago. Not very long at all. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I am giving a book as a gift to my boyfriend (us getting back together?) and need suggestions on a) a good place to look for rare-ish books online for a good deal b) a good philosophical piece that's spiritual, yet digestible to your average joe </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-23 01:48:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First off, yes, I'm getting him a 'omg, we're back together' gift. weird. But let's move on. And bare with me, book suggestions are needed.

A)

1: He's a fan of The Jungle Book movie, which is a pretty sweet animation. I just thought it'd be cute to go a step further and get him a first edition of the original, or a later edition with some age to it that he'd like. Maybe I'm thinking in the wrong direction. Any who, where a bouts could I find such a book for a good deal? In that same arena...

2: Disco Bloodbath by James St. James. Made impossible to find by Party Monster. We are a gay couple, and he's seen the movie and all it's horrific glory, and thought it'd be a sick find. I don't even know where I'd begin to find such a thing, and how much it's selling for. Is it too risky? Is the Jungle Book idea better? You tell me...

B) Scrap both of those ideas. Something philosophical? He was a philosophy major for awhile, and enjoys reading on the subject quite a bit. Very spiritual. Almost nihilistic. But I know for a fact he doesn't like pompous, or over the top eccentric language. Down to earth. Readable. Hopefully positive. I'm more of a 'tangible sciences' type of guy, so I really have no idea on what would be good. Help?

Overall, which idea do you like best, which is doable, and maybe what suggestions you might have.

Oh yea all online! 

Thanks r/booksuggestions!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a dog groomer, and sort of late to this one.

I've been grooming for around 2 years now, but when i started as an apprentice, my instructor wanted me to shave the hair out of a bulldog's pads (they have short hair, so this doesn't make sense, though i believe the dog stepped in something that gunked the hair together that the bath couldn't get out, I digress.) 

Well, I was doing my job, and as bulldogs normally do, he donkey kicked me. Except I had clippers in my hand. Well the clippers went flying. I fumbled them in the air for a few seconds while they were still running, and the clippers, just for a millisecond of a second, landed on the dog. They made a three inch line of no hair, on a dog that never needed to see clippers for a groom in its entire life (maybe a #50 or #60 blade for surgery prep, again, digressing.) Fortunately my instructor was cool about it, and explained it all to the owners, and took the blame herself. Could of been like a million times worse. But then again, I'm not sure the hair will grow back normally. Bulldogs are weird. </TEXT>

We broke up a few months ago, and got back together. My jealousy had a lot to do with it. I get pretty mad when he hangs out with his other gay friends. Especially older ones that are in open relationships. I've curbed it to some extent, because I know he loves me. I want him to have friends, and wants the same to me.

<TEXT> This made me sad to think about. Well... I got STD tested before I dated my first boyfriend at a christian testing center. We started dating, and then the results came back. It said I was HIV-1 positive. While I freaked out and got tested over and over again (even the state health department got involved), my boyfriend stayed by my side, well aware he might test positive as well. Every test came back negative, and I, understandably, lost my shit over the next 6 weeks. Finally, they were able to tell me I was negative. The whole thing of me losing my shit mentally, and this whole 'we both have HIV' thing threw a wrench in our relationship, so he broke up with me. Which I get. Completely. It was both of our first relationship and it was just totally fucked up by me. We've both moved on and done better and bigger things. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The little koala



Our story begins deep within a forest that was big, tall, and smelled clean all the time. The sky was always blue and the sun was so hot you could cook an egg on a rock. The leaves were crunchy, and the birds were real loud. They sounded just like in the movies. What does this sound like to you?


On one of these big, clean smelling trees, slept a little koala. She was small and grey. Her eyes closed shut and she snored, sometimes itching her little back with her big koala claws. A parrot looking bird called a cockatoo landed right next to her and woke her up with the birds loud squawk.


When the little koala awoke, she wasnt happy. She was grumpy from her nap. She likes to sleep all the time. The little koala was now hungry and grumpy, and wanted to drink some milk from her mother, so she called out to her mother. It sounded like coo-coo.


She looked to the left. She then looked to the right. Her mother was no where to be seen. All she could see was that loud cockatoo that woke her up. She began to cry, because now she was grumpy, hungry, and sad. Where did her mother go? Didnt she know it was time for the little koala to eat?


The cockatoo looked at the little koala with curiosity. This made the little koala even more grumpy. The cockatoo came closer, and closer, and closer. The little koala swatted the bird with her big claws, but the bird wouldnt go away. Off in the distance, a bunch of odd sounds finally scared the bird away. They were coming closer!


Bark, bark, bark, bark, the little koala had never heard the sounds before. They were new sounds, and they were scary sounds. They were getting louder, too! The little koala started climbing up her tree, as far up as she could climb with her little koala claws. The animals that made the 'bark bark bark sound were close.


She was so scared! She closed her eyes real tight, and imagined her mother was holding her close. Nothing could get her if her mother was there. Just like that, the barking stopped, and the scary animals ran away. She was still scared, but glad they were gone. She started climbing back down the tree, when all of the sudden she was stuck in a net!


The little koala fell from the tree inside this net, and she scratched and scratched so she could get free. She used all the strength she had in her little koala claws, but nothing worked. She soon gently fell to the ground, and was surrounded by a tall blonde woman that smelled like flowers. The little koala began to cry.


The woman quickly wrapped the little koala in a blanket and held her close. The little koala was less scared.
Im sorry, little koala. You must be so scared. Lets get you some food and a nice place to sleep, away from those dogs. Everything is going to be alright.
The little koala felt a little better from the sweet sound of her voice.


Just like the woman had said, the little koala was safe with her. She was no longer grumpy, and she was no longer hungry. The little koala wasnt mad, and she was no longer scared. She had a new home, with lots of other little koala friends, and she could still climb the clean smelling trees and sleep, just like where our story began.

<TEXT> It gets better once you don't test positive for THC, which could be a few weeks, or for me, a few months (I'm not fat, I'm big boned.... lol I'm not fat). 

Your symptoms of withdrawal will take about that amount of time. [Marijuana Anonymous' website](https://www.marijuana-anonymous.org) has a great section on what to expect with withdrawal. Some things i experienced? Mood swings, outburst, being thirsty, decreased then later increased appetite and weight gain, insomnia, paranoia, lethargy, believe it or not, these are normal. Your body is getting rid of THC, you will be weird. It looks like bipolar, schizophrenia, clinical insomnia, which you may or may not have, but you need to properly detox before getting the best diagnosis. Thank god I waited, cause I'm (mostly) good now and don't need medication for much of anything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's good man! I might even go a step farther though... It sounds cold as fuck, but friends that still smoke? I might just hangout with them less. Or if they do, let them know it can't be around you. For any reason. I mean I still have friends that smoke, just only a very select few. And they don't smoke around me. My boyfriend smokes as well. And I NEVER let him do it around me, he even keeps all his gear in a cabinet I don't go in to normally. What has happened, is that the people that smoke bud moved on. They didn't have a codependent in me, so they just found other people to blaze with. I'm better for it, they weren't real homies. Day.... 323 or something? I should probably know that. </TEXT>

Going on walks will become your best friend. Realize that you can only live day by day. Your goal is to not smoke JUST for today. You are not a fortune teller. You could pick up a joint tomorrow. But just for today, you won't. And that my dear friend, is amazing.

<TEXT> He wasn't much to look at,

The ragged, mange'd tiger.

Let's just say the years took a toll.


The cat had a strip of forest,

Grandfathered in, gifted, with

The occasional sika fawn, food.


Moving forward wasn't an issue,

And survival was second nature

When cornered with a hunter's gun.


Though on each side of the land,

Were two other tigers' territories,

Neither aware of the other.


He knew both of them intimately,

One of lust, adventure, new beginnings,

The other of a boundless, philosophical depth.


To turn your head to the wind,

Was to smell the latter in memories,

Or the former in pure hormonal drive.


How can a beast be tamed to a decision?

How can a baffoon even think decisively?

How can a bundle of sticks catch a flame?


More importantly, and quite obviously, 

How did the fellow get to be so lucky

As to have to ask God on advice for love? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys!

Well to start out, i first smoked pot when I was around 16, to get closer to friends I may or may not have had crushes on. Well music sort of replaced that, so I didn't smoke really until college, and I met more attractive people whom I wanted attention from!

Soon, it wasn't about friends, it was about feeding my monster (I'm the monster). Reisin tokes from pipes that weren't mine, stealing from friends, digging through my car carpet to look for little nugs, hitting up people to hook up with ONLY because I wanted to smoke (I think that counts as a form of prostitution?); I was a slob. I had this chick that worked at a clinic tell me I was on the lower end of the pot smoking pyramid. I agreed not knowing how right she actually was.

So I went to rehabs. 3. When I was 19 (outdoor wilderness... sweet), 21 (hospital?), and 22 (mostly heroin junkies there... fuck). Nothing worked. I seemed to get out, be sober for awhile, then just kind of meet up with certain people and it'd be back to square one. Well most recently, I was sober, working a great job, then just kind of got desperate. Met a stoner, moved across the country with him, and surprisingly (not surprisingly) my life turned to shit quickly. So I quit. I quit pot, quit him, moved back, and got my life back on track.

I've pissed off a lot of people in my life. I make amends when I can. I find prayer helps. Working. Being proud of my work. Dating has been considerably less stressful and oddly enough, people find me more attractive? Weird. It's also weird to look at that number. 320. A lot has happened in those days. First 2 months I was still basically a train wreck while I detoxed. I got over it with a good diet. But it just zoomed by. Life has gone by, with or without pot. Now I'm just aware of it. The haze has been lifted and I can exist within the days passing by.

So. Thanks for existing. Thanks for not smoking pot. And thanks for reading a little bit about myself that i don't normally get to share. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok few things

1) I would always go the professional route, 10 lbs australian shepherd should only be about 50 bucks.

2) If I was absolutely strapped for cash (and wasn't a groomer), I wouldn't use clippers on the dog, especially a double coated dog like yours. The hair grows back badly, ruins the top coat. I would skim the butt area, where the most hair grows, with the clippers. I've used a 10, but you can make mistakes easily. If you don't want to make a mistake, use thinning sheers to make the butt area behind the back legs look uniformly rounded. Then, I would make the outline of the dog even (the back of the front legs, the chest, the undercarriage) with thinning sheers. It's a great, natural look. For the clippers, I would clean the anal area (one inch each side to make sure poop doesn't get stuck), the bottom of the paws (scooping out the hair gently), and that's about it. #10 blade, I use a #40 on the feet, don't do that. I would not shave this dog, and i would beg a client not to either. This is a brushing dog. Lots and lots of brushing. Make sure the dog is 100% dry before doing any of this, and clean 100%.

Edit: Tired of hand scissoring? Skim with a #10, just do it at your own risk. You may make holes.

Let me know if you have any other questions. </TEXT>

Spring, the Dongyang streets often inundated with strange taste. Dongyang people say that this is the boy egg taste, but also the taste of spring. 
Do not want to surprise people familiar with the matter: the boy with the boy in urine is boiled eggs, eggs, eggs in the spring of stalls selling all over the lad Dongyang streets. A fifty-one lad expensive than ordinary eggs boiled eggs, can often sell out of stock. 
Do not underestimate this one boy eggs, it was named Dongyang intangible cultural heritage. 
Classroom door 
The boys in front of a plastic barrel "hush hush" 
Dongyang city in an elementary school, recess, a bunch of little boys crowded in the hallway outside the classroom noisy. Do not think that what they are playing new stuff, they are urinating. 
In Dongyang, this old custom has been formed: the street vendors who sell eggs boy or boy eggs to cook their own people, will be carrying a plastic bucket to a school boy to collect the urine. 
Students who long ago got used to this, one to three grade boys to urinate, he will align the plastic bucket outside the classroom. School teacher, also acquiesced in such behavior, they will always remind the kids not to pee in a plastic bucket during cold sick. The children came obedient. 
Boiled eggs and cook boiled eggs almost boy 
The most critical time heat 
Oddly enough, although this season has filled the stalls sell eggs boy, but every family believes their own unique taste. 
Li aunt runs a stall selling eggs boy. Her husband went to a nearby elementary school is responsible for daily pick boy urine. She is responsible for cooking and trafficking. 
In front of her stall, a briquette stove is hard to give steel cookware is heated. Pot head "water" looks yellow, which also had a little foam afloat. Li aunt to wash eggs one by one into steel finishing Guo Lifang. 
"After this road to boil, put all our eggs out, knock crack the shell, and put into cooking. Over time, then up and down to change the location of the eggs, add fresh boy urine. This repeated, with different fire , cook the whole day and night. "When it comes to the process of boiled eggs, and Li said the aunt, principle and almost cooked boiled eggs, and time to master the furnace is the most critical. 
Some people say eating addiction "really sweet", some people feel that "stinks" 
With urinary boiled eggs, what would taste? 
Yesterday, 12:00 many people coming and going on the road, Dongyang urban revitalization, visit the lad egg eaters natural lot. "Good food, I eat 10 it one day." Liu Dongyang several years ago with her husband came to life, "had never eaten later after eating a hooked." 
If one sentence Dongyang preference for boy eggs, friends, "surname eggs" on the microblogging put it very well - the lad egg taste is the taste of spring. 
But not all people are good this one Dongyang. 30 years, a native of Lee boy did not eat eggs, "that I can not stand the taste, I thought of nausea, stinks." 
Boy eggs fill it? TCM each saying: be careful to eat, no objection 
Dongyang in many people's eyes, with a boy in urine cooked eggs, spring tonic of choice. Boy selling eggs will always tell you, boy eat eggs, spring would not be sleepy, summer does not heat stroke. 
But to say this thing is going to fill a number, maybe the doctors would be more objective point. 
"Boy has a long history of eggs in Dongyang, previously poor living conditions, to do farm work, to make himself something only the eggs, while urine sediment over time, will form crystals, which is equivalent to a crystalline called 'white people' of traditional Chinese medicine, can nourishing yin, bleeding governance silt. "Dongyang City Hospital medical director Wu Yunhua introduced this boy eggs. But she also stressed that not everyone is suitable for the boy to eat eggs, depending on the individual's constitution. 
Jinhua Central Hospital Nephrology Master Ren Huangjian think, urine is the body's waste discharge, substantially free of substances beneficial to the human body. Therefore, he does not advocate everyone to eat the boy eggs. 
TCM  Jinhua City Hospital director said that, in ancient times, the boys often used as medicine introduction of urine, but modern health perspective, children boiled eggs in urine is always less hygienic. "But boy eating eggs has become Dongyang local customs, I do not advocate nor oppose it." 
Reporters also learned that the boy has been named Dongyang egg Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2008. In this regard, it is  Intangible Cultural Heritage Protection Center for  said that he collected information lad eggs and handed application. Finally, Dongyang folk art leadership team nine members unanimously adopted, after two weeks of publicity, Dongyang city government official under the document. 
Future, but also to declare non-heritage boy eggs or Jinhua, Zhejiang, it? Gong Mingwei said being no such intention.

<TEXT> This sounds like I'm talking to a college freshman holy shit. I work. I've been around the block. I work with dogs all the freaking time (also went to college). I don't know what your credentials are, doesn't sound like they're based in anything but trolling. I thought this was a cool groom. Doesn't hurt the dog. AND it has Nintendo characters on it. So cool. So I post it on r/gaming. My intention wasn't to argue with children. </TEXT>

<TEXT> idk about that, standard poodles are pretty well behaved, intelligent dogs. if they didn't stand still for this, they wouldn't have been picked to be used. the whole process takes weeks, usually in short sessions of an hour or two at a time. i think it's great, and the dogs get spoiled.

<TEXT> Take a bowl, put in some flour. Put a one or two pinches of baking soda and salt, any spices you want like pepper or cumin, whatever. Mix it dry, then slowly add water. Slowly mixing it, until it is doughy, not running. You want to be able to knead it in your hands (having flour on your hands help not get them disgusting). Do it for like... 5-10 minutes? Then flatten it in to small patties. Put the patty away from the flame, but close enough that it gets cooked, and here's the kicker, right on the ashes. What?! But then I'm eating ash! No, you pat it away after the bread cooks, plus, a little ash never hurt anyone. It's awesome, amazing, and great to eat with beans, hummus, meat, whatever. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not confusion if they've come to terms with their identity. Heteronormative culture tells you because of your genitals at birth, you fit in this corner or that corner. That's what has people confused at a young age. Their brains tell them what society says is not true. That constant chastising of a person's personal gender identity, such as saying a woman is not a woman, because she happened to be born with a penis, is transphobia. With or without whatever genitals said person has, it's not your business, and it's not a determinate factor of that person's gender identity or sexuality. </TEXT>

"... Craig, calm down, I'm her- OH MY GOD. WHAT DID YOU DO CRAIG?! OH MY GOD WHAT DID YOU DO?! TELL ME!!! GODDAMNIT CRAIG, WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER?!"

Craig sat there sobbing. Throwing his fist at the ground. Screaming. Torrents of tears fell to the ground already splattered in blood.

"Oh my god Craig, we have to get you out of here. There's going to be cops, investigators, detectives, I mean our finger prints are over... wait. She wrote something. This bitch wrote something."

Just staring is erecting.


This group drinks,

And grunts, and talks,

And I want her innards.


She's carrying,

And I can see it,

I just need patience.


I wait till they leave,

She walks off,

I follow her breath.


The bitch tilts and cocks,

I balk and dive down,

She keeps going.


I'm hot, I'm sweating,

It's a hundred degrees

And my lips are on-

"BILL!!! BILL!!! I GOT EM'! BAG'D THAT HUGE WOLF SONUVABITCH!"

<TEXT> Mars is such a cruel place to live.

Don doesnt use my name, just keeps me locked up in this little cage all day and night while he fiddles with colonizers, mining for riches as I soil my cage.

My names Bethany; you should remember that, that and Ive been trafficked here for fucks and giggles.

Well, its been about 4 months since Don found me on a personal ad, drugged me, raped me, trapped me in a small box, and kept me in his work building on the Mars colony.

I only know where I am because of passerbys shooting the shit about the glories of space expansion.

No, I cant talk back, hes got a ball gag in my mouth, Don isnt that stupid.

I also know something thats quite interesting about the room Im trapped in, and that is that it contains quite a large amount of explosives.

I dont like to toot my own horn, but I know a thing or two about blowing buildings up to high heaven, in this case THE heavens.

During his last fuck-and-go, I managed to fiddle up a spare lighter from the sleaze bag's pocket and jam up my well, you get the point.

So Im going out with a bang. </TEXT>

Well I was grinding one of the dogs nails, and I looked away for a second to answer a coworkers question, and she didn't like me just holding up her paw. She growled for half a second and snapped her jaws about an inch from my face. I heard her teeth. Finished the nails quickly. Took a break immediately.

3) Procreation and advanced societies don't necessarily correlate. "First World Countries" tend to have fewer babies, not more. More birth control, abortion, planned pregnancy. Essentially, people fucking in the butt.

4) First Nation Americans, Tahitians, Mesoamericans, Indians, I'm sure I'm missing a few others, but shoot, send me a message and i'll send you towards a whole bunch of historical websites on gay and transgendered relationships and social structures throughout history! Yay learning!

5) Try using the word gay. 'Homosexual' comes off as offensive. Makes me feel like I'm a monkey in a cage. But what do I know. I'm just a gay man in a straight man's world. </TEXT>

Shelties are the shit! Make sure to find a good breeder, as recently, the breed standard has been for a narrow cranium, which has lead to a whole host of neurological disorders.

Other than that, need plenty of mental stimulation and exercise, basic to groom, just daily brushing, bath every few weeks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Bill!
I grew up watching your shows in the classroom, and those shows helped blossom my interest in science throughout the years to such an extent! Thank you so much.
My question relates to extinct/endangered species and this current Holocene extinctionary period, and what we can do to prevent some of the loss.

I understand that certain institutions exist that preserve endangered and extinct animal DNA and bodily samples, such as [The Frozen Zoo at the San Diego Zoo](http://www.sandiegozooglobal.org/what_we_do_banking_genetic_resources/frozen_zoo/), with the hopes of maybe one day being able to recreate these species, such as what they did with the [Banteng](http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Clone-of-endangered-species-succeeds-Angus-cow-2656880.php). You hear people talking about wanting to bring back the mammoth, or thylacine.

Some scientist, such as [Dr. Paul Martin](http://www.amazon.com/Twilight-Mammoths-Extinctions-Rewilding-Environments/dp/0520252438) actually wanted to sustain large numbers of ice age megafauna on the U.S. continent, brought in from other parts of the world.

My question is this: do you believe our resources are better spent conserving the life that currently exists on this planet, further preventing mass extinction? Are these ideas of resurrection too 'sic-fi' and farfetched to be beneficial in the name of biodiversity? 

Again, thank you so much for inspiring generations of kids around the country.
Cheers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A zebra, probably a Lybra, she was caught in my gaze

Like her distant cousin in pun, his starstruck.

Now a thirsty tiger like myself can't pass

A thick slice of that rump roast toasting in

My stomach by the moonlit sky on cocaine,

So of course I made one of those "Purrs you

Folk seem so interested, fascinated by; innocence.

That fat beast got on her fours and crawled

Towards the worst motherfucker in that place,

I proceded to lick my lips in anticipation, excitement.

Hours to the powers of infinite Algorithmic numerals

Passed by as I could taste that smooth red nectar,

That rotting smell in her nether region that enthralls,

Orchestrates the crowds to pull a Wagner Finale.

As my dead mother once snarled, "Patience, shithead.

And oh how she was so on the forehead! 

Seize the night!

I couldn't hold myself; claws extracted and my muscles

Pulsated in the direction of the flesh I was tearing off.

All I needed was a good grip, just the tip to tip the

Domino towards her larynx and esophageal passage.

Crush wouldn't even begin to describe the sounds that

Exuded out of her meat hole, snout flaring; fireworks.

I was bathing in showers of punctured pipelines giving

Oxygen not to her dying vivacarcass, but to my brain.

Puss, bile, feces, lymphatic fluids, bacteria I can't even say,

It all tasted like the best ecstasy I ever bought from a South Korean.

I mean honestly I'm surprised no one else said anything,

How embarrassing, there must of been sixty, seventy, other

Large Organisms in that same room, not to mention smaller

Non-invited creatons, protazoa, shit that can live for millennia.

I could of swore some of my saliva with that zebra's amniotic

Fluid got all over a Brown Hyena here for business, his markings

Only added to the stench of the carnaged carrion caf-carnival

(It's pretty much Lucifer meets your pretentious local French coffee place).

Some aardvark tried smelling up the flailing body, but I made it

Clear with my urine that my domience was in this territory.

And her breathing stopped.

Well someone had to break the ice, you know all those carnivores

Were in that kill from head to toe to tail to vestigial sense of empathy.

The plant eaters took the chance to sneak in some round two and three

Cud chewing, or in the various Rodentia, Lagamorph, anything else

Not so fucking flinty that I couldn't outrun a scary thought,

Whatever weed grows in the ever blood filled cracks in the grey

Cement layed on the backyard patio, I told him to do wood panels.

Everyone was in a feeding orgy, death brought life and some great

One on one on two on one on three beastial, primordial sexual

Encounters of the thirteenth kind, unlucky to the fallen soldier,

God Bless the flesh we are about to produce into skat, not rats.

But wait,

You are sitting on your pedestal thinking, "What a crazy tale, 

You corky, illmanered feline of an endangered speiciest deity.

You talk about death and violence like the weather, promotion,

Remotion from the motion you stir in our community, THE CHILDREN!

Sir, I'm pro-you-gonna-die, and that watermelon of a sense of morality

You're juggling on your head neglects one major factor.,

You can't run the jungle with out killing some fuckers.

Heads getting a roll, dinner plates go to my mate, you do you

And I'm gonna go ahead and do me while I finish this bitch Zebras

Blood covered tang smeared all across my nose;

CAN YOU SMELL THE FREEDOM? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Nope. I have heard of some terrible "get 'em any way you can" anecdotes (such as barring entry onto sports teams until they take a 'special bath'), but always within the context of such practices being morally reprehensible. We also have rules for potential converts, such as not baptising those who are underage without permission from their parents.

<TEXT> A flight going from Cairo to Johannesburg was about half-way through their trip. Out of the blue, the captain made a startling announcement,

"Folks, it seems as though we are having some engine troubles. Now please remain calm, and we'll have an update in 15 minutes."

Obviously everyone is freaking out. 15 minutes go by. Captain makes another announcement.

"Ok seems as though one of our engines has failed. We are going to make a landing at the nearest airstrip. We'll give you another update in 15 minutes."

People are still freaking out. Another 15 minutes go by. Captain makes his announcement.

"It seems as though the second engine has failed and we're losing altitude quickly. We will be throwing out the luggage to lighten our load. Hopefully this helps our situation."

Utter pandaemonium in the cabin. The captain's voice hushes the people.

"It seems as though we are still quickly losing altitude. We do have emergency parachutes, but only enough for a certain amount of passengers. Now to be fair, we will call upon passengers alphabetically. If your group is not called, then you will receive a parachute. Sound good?"

The passengers begrudgingly agree.

"Now, A, will all the Africans please raise your hand."

No one moves a muscle.

"Ok... B, will all the blacks please raise your hand."

Again, no one moves.

"Fine, C, will all the Coloreds raise your hand."

Still, no body raises their hands. 

A young boy, confused, looks around, and nudges his dad.

"Dad, dad, aren't we all of those?"

"Shhhh, son, quiet, we are Zulu." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was in Costa Rica on a river boat tour, and our tour guide just randomly jumped out of the boat without explanation. He jumped from mangrove to mangrove, until he ran to a tree about a hundred meters away and proceeded to climb up the tree. He grabbed a branch, shimmied down, slowly made his way back to the boat. With him, was one of these [guys](http://cdn1.arkive.org/media/7C/7CD5F38B-EC21-4B40-8914-DCF40152145B/Presentation.Large/Pygmy-anteater-in-defensive-posture.jpg), and my love for the silky anteater began.

I kind of forced him out of the closet when I would sleep over at his house and wake up with him, oops). So before my dad even got around to meeting my ex, my ex boyfriend sent me a picture of his gigantic penis to my phone. My dad happened to be cleaning, stubbled upon said penis picture on my phone, and proceeded to cuss me out and argue that i break up with him immediately. Yay! </TEXT>

I went on an exchange program to Bavaria in Southern Germany, where I 'attended' [Gymnaisum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium_(school) for two weeks (it was sweet, we got to go to whatever class we felt like that day). Well... one day i felt like going in to a history class. I didn't realize it at first, but after a few minutes, enough of the little german I knew clicked, and I realized I had walked in to a very in detail class discussion about the holocaust. I mean, man, they talked about things I didn't even know or think about. Ideology, methodology, specific locations, names/dates/times, etc. I was startled, but grateful the truth was out there for the next generation of germans.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, so as a gay guy, I've actually thought about this a lot. 
As a child growing up, it's hard feeling comfortable in your own skin because everyone else around you seems so normal, and ironically being social and making close friendships with other guys, just makes you feel further alienated and alone. 
So the conversation, "I can change", "I can get cured", "This is happening for such and such reason", replay over and over again in your young, still developing brain.
Then the delusion sets in of, "Well, what if I woke up one morning, and *BAM*, I was only attracted to chicks." It's a sick fantasy I held on to, almost until I came out. 
My answer? I would of probably tried to make it national news, and get other people cured as well. Why let others suffer internally if there was a way out? If I could stop suicide, or drug and alcohol abuse, or a kid from becoming homeless or a prostitute?
Alas, now I'm out, and **proud as fuck**. </TEXT>
