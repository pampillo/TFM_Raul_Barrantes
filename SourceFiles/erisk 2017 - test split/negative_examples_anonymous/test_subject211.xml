<DATE> 2015-07-01 12:45:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It seems as though whenever there is a monotheistic religion introduced to an area it seems to dominate. We saw this in various places, such as Christianity supplanting Hellenic, Germanic, Celtic, and Slavic beliefs. We saw Islam supplanting Zoroastrian and African pagan beliefs, and we saw Judaism supplanting polytheistic beliefs in Judea. Why does this trend seem to also carry though history? As whenever Europeans colonized a new area of the world the natives seemed to usually convert very quickly. Is there a reason Monotheistic beliefs have so much more power over people? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just because there were a lot of them doesn't mean they weren't centralized. When I say centralized I simply mean that the way the governments of those nations worked was by having a series of small scale administrators running the nation and paying nearly all of their collected taxes, men etc forward to the Emperor. Contrast that with CK2 Mechanics in which there are relatively few larger lords who take cuts of everything from taxes to levies. The closest analogue China would really have with CK2 mechanics would be having the Emperor control all of China in his demense, but due to the nature of CK2 that just wouldn't work. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly the Feudal aspect is why I don't think it would work. At the time of CK2 China was operating under a centralized Empire rather than a Feudal society. The reason I don't think China would work is because they didn't even have Feudalism (at least not in the sense of Europe and the middle east) </TEXT>

For instance, I go to the offers page click on something that says (roughly) "Sign up for X brand gift card!" - 50 SB. I follow the link, signup for the card and provide all my information, and then do a ton of surveys before getting to the end, checking my balance and 90% not seeing it change. Is there a reason?

<TITLE> After the end Americanist election glitch. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-14 22:45:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm playing as an Americanist character in the 'After the End' mod and I control what is pretty much the largest realm in the game. Other than some characters down in Florida I also control all Americanist characters and provinces. So, the president of the USA died a few years ago and since then I have been campaigning the become the next president. I have the overwhelming majority of votes, with over 1000 whereas my closest competitor only has 80-ish. But the problem is that the election has been running for the past 5 years. I tried restarting my game twice and it didn't fix the glitch. My best guess is that it hasn't triggered the 'elections nearly over' event yet, so it hasn't ended the elections.

Anyone got any ideas to fix this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I Think the reason why so many Americans, as well as myself, are against the idea of paying the tax because it's non-optional and it's very likely it won't benefit you.

Think about it, if you're a young American who has no real health problems and rarely needs to go to the doctor then why would you want to pay for a service you're most likely never going to need? Or even worse, if you're someone who is struggling to get by paying for things like rent or food, then how are you going to survive when you're now being forced to pay for health insurance?

And then there's the fact that people who have health insurance would never want to switch to national healthcare, think of these peoples mentality's, it goes from "I make money and i'm successful so I can ensure that if I ever get hurt I'll get proper medical care" to "I make money and i'm successful so now I have to pay for other people to get medical care.

Really I think you just need to look at it from all the perspectives you can think of and realize that to a lot of them national healthcare is unappealing and it's not just them being evil and mean. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-03-03 08:38:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys, so I just fucked up a few minutes ago, lemme explain.

It's 2 in the morning and i'm 16, I have my own room and laptop, it's a simple laptop, a chromebook, but it does what I need it to do. However, I'm also a heavy listener of music and as such have a nice pair of over the ear headphones. So i come into my room, I had just gotten back from using the bathroom after trying to fall asleep for the past four hours, but try as I might I can't sleep.

As I come back into my room I decide that sleep isn't happening so I instead opt to go to grab my computer and surf the web. I begin surfing and after a while I decide to put on some music, I check to make sure my headset is plugged in. Now, my headset has two plugs a USB and an audio/mic cable. I can feel that it's plugged into the USB port but the audio cable isn't plugged in so I quickly fix that, however my chromebook only has one input that works as either a mic port or an audio out port.

I plug in the audio cable, not really looking, and pull up [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IwmYAdgU18) The song starts up and I notice it's a bit quiet, so I bump up the volume on my chromebook until it's at full volume, at this point it's listenable and I'm pleasantly rocking out. About 2 minutes later my dad bursts into the room, yelling at the top of his lungs about how he has work tomorrow and I need to turn that down immediately.

I'm confused for a moment before I look down and notice that... My mic cable was plugged in instead of my audio out cable.
Since I had noise cancelling headphones I hadn't noticed them yelling at me to turn it off, and I hadn't noticed that it was so quiet even at max volume because I had those on...

TL;DR: Mix up mic input and audio output cables for my headset and end up blasting Rock music at full volume at 2:00 in the morning. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I'm making my first map and when I upload it it get's all glitchy. I checked online on how to make borders and it showed them using the division, whereas when I drew it I drew the borders of every province without using division in inkscape. Does this mean I did it wrong and have to re-do the whole thing using the division method, or is there a way I can salvage my map?

BTW. From what I can figure, the problem is that in Inkscape the borders for all the objects overlap, creating problems with the borders. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A new vegas DLC where you travel to the heartlands of the leigon. Inside the totalitarian regime you can either choose to help Caesar suppress a large rebel, or, you can support the cause, bring down the harsh dictator and creating a new series of smaller states. Yet another option would be to fight both sides for your, or the NCR's gain.

I'd really love to see this because the legion is so hyped up in the vanilla game and we see so little of it in the game that it's honestly a bit of a tragedy. Bethesda missed a golden opportunity with the legion, think about it, roads, aqueducts, law enforcement, all of these are things that are mentioned in the base game and never delivered upon. It'd be awesome to see all the public works built by the romans that Caesar surely would've recreated.

Plus, it would give a nice moral lesson and parallel history, the rebels representing barbarians and the legion representing the legion. Because after all...

Rome. Rome never changes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd like to see a situation where we'ed get to see the public works built by the leigon. Think about it, if caesar is actually basing himself off of the old caesar's of the roman empire then he would surely adopt one of the practices the romans were most notable for. It'd be nice to be able to go a bit deeper into leigon territory to see things like roads and aqueducts and water purification systems. That's part of why the old empire was so successful. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, If you want to make a new omegle then it's gonna be *pretty damn difficult.* First off, do you know how to even create a webpage? You'd need to have a good understanding of CSS, HTML, probably Ruby, Javascript, maybe PHP. And you'd have to understand how to organize a database effectively. Next, you'd have to get a host. I doubt your internet is strong enough to hold more than 100-500 people in your web server so you'd have to get a pro hosting company to help you there.

Then would come the trouble of hosting the server, making sure it all runs smoothly and efficiently. Server management, making sure you don't explode, etc.

Then you'd have to attract people. If you just want to be able to talk to around 10 people then you might as well just get an IRC going. If you want to attract the kinds of visitors that omegle gets then you'd have to have some form of viral marketing going for you. 

Alright, your server runs fine, the webpage works and looks good, you've got a couple thousand people on and it all looks good. You go to chat with someone and they say "ASL?"

Well great. Now you have to moderate it to get rid of people like that. Good luck having any freetime at all because you're so pre-occupied with making these people behave.

Alright, let's say you put filters in place to auto-block these people. Well, they all leave, after all the people who just ask "ASL" leaves (Which is 90% of omegle) you'll be left with a couple hundred to a thousand people who actually want to talk.

But guess what! they don't want to be on anymore because now 90% of the population is gone and there's no one to talk to.

So good job, you've got maybe 30-50 people on at a time who are actually good to talk to. Talk to them. Eventually you run out of strangers and everyone gets bored.

Now, if you keep paying the server bill then people may, occasionally pass by your site, pop in and see that it's a ghost town and then promptly leave.

Is this what you want? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alright. This is what I got.

http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Power_Warping

Hoo boy, the ability to warp the powers of most super heroes would mean I could simply make them into normal humans. I believe this power would also let me increase my own strength; meaning i'd probably just make myself incredibly strong and make my enemies weaker than myself. I imagine it'd be a bit like a soul suck ability.

http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Interface_Creation

This is pretty boring. I'm not sure if i'd use it in a battle honestly. It may be useful to give myself some sort of HUD. An optical overlay with stuff like a tracking system would be useful for mid-combat.

http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Multi_Strike

This would be pretty fun. Finish off my opponents this way. If I were to decrease my enemies strength and raise my own then this would probably be my way of manually fighting them. I'd not be able to resist shouting "Ahtatatatata" while I did it though.

I that with the first power alone I could oneshot beings like superman. Against god-like beings it may be more difficult but presumably I could use my powers on them too. </TEXT>

Or look at the sierra games, they also focused quite a bit on story and many came out before the first super mario bros.

All I'm saying is that story has always been a major part of gaming. </TEXT>

But the reason I picked legend of zelda and battery saving as my example was because it's semi-well known that zelda introduced battery saving and was more relate-ible for most people in the thread. </TEXT>

It saved your progress and meant games could go from one repetitive task capable of repeating infinitely and meant for a single round to be over in one sitting to large, epic games.

Do you think stuff like skyrim, deus ex, civ, or bioshock could exist without saving? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't mean martial arts that grant super speed, strength, sense, Etc. But rather are there any martial arts that use pressure points as their main way of combat? I know many martial arts use pressure points but only at the more advanced level and as more of a side to the main technique. But are there any martial arts that use pressure point almost exclusively? </TEXT>

<TEXT> i'd recommend just meditating. Don't try and do anything advanced just sit in a comfortable spot, if you have it the put on some calming soft music at a relatively low volume. Sit down in your comfortable spot, it should be somewhere where you can relax and no one will bother you, though if you can then try and have atleast some sunlight coming down on you.

After you find somewhere that works, sit down, with your music on and sit in whatever position is most comfortable. I sit in the classic cross-legged "buddhist" position but it really doesn't matter so long as you're comfortable, you can relax, and your spine's straight. Speaking of which, when you sit down. Make sure to keep your spine straight, this is very important and should never be neglected.

After you sit down in a comfortable position close your eyes and begin breathing slowly. Inhale for two seconds through the nostril, hold the air in for two seconds, exhale for two second, and keep the air out for 2 second. Repeat this cycle while clearing your mind of stray thoughts. The way I do this is by recognizing a thought in my brain and simply easing it away, once your mind is clear begin relaxing your body, continue breathing deeply and straighten your spine while concentrating on a body part and visualizing it slowly dissipating into nothingness. start out by doing this to your fingers and then your arms, feet, legs etc until your entire body is relaxed.

Now that you're relaxed simply continue to breath and keep your mind clear of stray thoughts. If you had any objectives then you should do them now. Keep your mind clear, your spine straight, and your breathing stable for about 15 minutes. After a decent amount of time has passed while you're relaxed slowly begin to move your body parts, wiggle a toe or a finger and slowly bring yourself out of the meditative state.

After the meditation I'm usually a little sore from sitting for so long so just get up and walk around a bit, eat some food and have something to drink.

Don't worry if you can't do all this on your first try. It took me several weeks of meditation to be able to do it regularly. Once you can do this easily and quickly (5 minutes or less to get to meditative state) then you should be able to do most other rituals.

<TEXT> I'm in a similar situation, I've beaten the game 10 or so times now, I've gone good legion, bad legion, good NCR, bad NCR, Good house, Bad House, all 3 independents, I've played through all DLC 15 or so times. I've reached lvl 50 3 times and my first save has every unique weapon and all the gold from the sierra madre as well as all locations visited.

It took me about 100 hours to do that one save file and I have about 600 hours altogether in NV but the ending...

I mean, they could've just released a DLC to continue it like they did with 3. I think the reason they didn't do it was because it was too ambitious. They'd have to make hundreds of different version of the mojave because even doing something slightly different changes the ending. To measure up they'd have to make sure your decisions are reflected everywhere. That'd take way to much time and way to much money for one $15 DLC to make it worthwhile. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fallout: New Vegas. The game was amazing and definitely ranks up there in my top 10 games of all time. Probably my top 5 even, but when I finally beat Lanius and general Oliver congratulated me I expected something... More, it just plays the epilogue and you have to go back to a save from before the battle at hoover dam. This was exactly what people didn't like about Fallout 3 and I understand they didn't have a post game because of time-restraints but....

I wish they had atleast had a DLC which continued it. The ending was okay, but in comparison to the rest of the game it just left me feeling empty and wanting more. </TEXT>

The guy you're talking about, (no idea who he is BTW) could use his aikido but he would only be able to do it as quickly as a normal human being, he couldn't jump 50 feet in the air he could jump 5, He couldn't punch through a concrete wall but he could punch through an interior wall.

<DATE> 2014-07-28 00:53:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Every real martial art including all major styles fights along with all fictional martial arts. All martial arts gets the greatest ever practitioner of the art to represent them, if a martial art has it's practitioner be stronger than a normal human athlete (IE: Kenshiro or Goku), they will be scaled down to only be able to do what a olympic athlete human can do. Ki blasts are allowed but they can't be any stronger than a punch and take twice the effort of throwing that punch physically.

If a martial art involves the use of weapons as a requirement (Like kendo or fencing) they will be given a standard quality version of the weapon made of either metal or wood, however, martial arts which have weapons as optional (Like aikido) are not given weapons and are only allowed to use their fists.

No rules are enforced so hits to the groin and gouging of the eyes are perfectly fine.

The arena is a large, flat stadium with more than enough room for all competitors.

Round 1: All real martial arts in a team VS all fictional martial arts in a team.

Round 2: Free for all, all martial arts against each other, alliances can be formed but only one can stand at the end.

Round 3: free for all in which fictional martial arts are no longer allowed to use any form of ki/energy attacks.

Round 4: All competitors are given SMG's, Automatic shotguns, and chainsaws, which art lasts the longest. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I myself am in a very similar situation to yours. I too live in a christian household and I'm thus, unable to perform any rituals beyond meditation before bed. What I'd recommend is thus. If you want to contact your guardian demon, either find a time when your family is gone and perform a summoning ritual then. Or try and astral project. By astral projection you could seek the guidance of a guardian demon. However, what I would most strongly recommend is to simply wait. You've already made admiral progress simply by recognizing these truths and by partaking in power meditations, no one expects you to do anything more. Simply keep meditating and wait until you're old enough to move out of your families house. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Being a magician/warlock just means you use ritual to somehow gain power. Aesthetically being a magician/warlock just means you somehow internalize your power through ritual and end up becoming a stronger person IE: you become more motivated, you begin working out more. stuff like that. (I can't elaborate very well on the subject as I myself am a theistic satanist)

Theistically being a warlock/magician is invoking satan and his demons to help you in a task IE: Attracting money towards you through ritual. Or you use meditation to program your own aura to do something IE: make people more attracted to you. Personally I prefer the later option as it empowers you more and gives you more control.

If you have any more questions PM me with them. [Here's a list of spells that I often use in meditation but they are by no means the only spell. experiment and find what works for you. But remember affirmation is probably the best way to program your aura](http://www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/Satanic_Magick.html) </TEXT>

<TEXT> /u/weaslelord found something interesting over on /r/gaming. Here's a direct quote from his post.

Looks like for whatever reason the Dota site has a countdown built in to it. This is what the URL that the TF2 site is hitting: http://www.dota2.com/jsfeed/timeuntilpdt?time=17%20Jun%202014%2017:00:00[1] (at which point they then do stuff to update the countdown and such). No Team Defense of the Fortress 2 unfortunately. Not this time, anyway.

What he's saying is that the timer isn't contained on the TF2 site but is rather directed through the DOTA website. this indicates that this timer **MIGHT** (and stress the might) have something to do with DOTA as well as TF2.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alright, can we just end the discussion here? It's obvious we'll keep going over why sacrifice is or isn't wrong ad infinitum.

The only reason the sidebar said what it said was to give an example. It wasn't saying Satanism *couldn't be about these things* but rather that hollywood often sensationalize's the activity's of your everyday satanist.

We could go on and on for years about how the sidebar is worded and whether or not it's dictating what satanism is or isn't about.

So let's just stop here and say we're both wrong in some respects and right in some respects. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Changed the sidebar again. I'm starting to feel i've lost my integrity at this point.

As for the sacrifice. Why would satan want an animal dead? If he demanded sacrifices then he would be just as corrupt and evil as any other god. not only that but what could sacrificing say a goat possibly do for him? It'd serve no purpose and the goat would have died for no reason. not even to be eaten.

If you're an atheist and you sacrifice a goat then it's the same thing. All your doing is appeasing yourself and in the process you take a goats life. Hence, something I don't do myself but if you really feel like you have to go ahead. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I took your advice and changed the bit on the sidebar (I didn't actually write the sidebar, /u/bb411114 did btw)

As for the bit about sacrifice, the reason I don't agree with sacrfice is because killing the animal serves no actual purpose. If you slaughter an animal to eat it at least you have a reason to kill it. Same thing with coats.

Now for sacrificing it to satan lets look at it in 2 ways. First let's start with the theistic ideology: Why would satan want you to kill an animal for him? There's nothing the animal dying actually does for him, also Satan is kind and caring. The animals are just as much his followers as you or I are. so why would he wish for them to die?

As for atheistic sacrificing. If you don't even believe in a higher power what's the point of killing an animal? to appease yourself?  if you're doing it simply to make yourself feel better then you might have seriously rethink some of your life decisions.

As for drinking blood. If both parties consent to it and agree that they wish to drink each other's blood then I see nothing wrong. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What the sidebar was talking about was how many parts of our culture talk about satanism in a way that makes people think it's all about sacrificing virgins and eating animals hearts. You can see this is the way satanism is presented by many media outlets who just want to make a quick buck and sensationalize our faith. hence the "hollywood style depictions" line.

The message wasn't you shouldn't be allowed to but rather that's not what most sects are all about. If that's what you as an individual do as a way to express yourself then I'm not going to stop you for the express reason of "That's not what satanism is about." Though I am ideologically opposed to sacrifice myself because of moral reason's. I'm not going to stop you.

TL;DR It's not saying you can't. It's saying that the sensationalized hollywood version of satanism isn't what every satanist is about. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Gordon Freeman with his full arsenal from half-life 1 VS Gordon Freeman with his full arsenal from half-life 2 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-15 00:23:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The opponents:

Gordon freeman from HL1:

* A scientist with a PhD in theoretical physics from M.I.T working at black mesa research facility in new mexico. he is a highly intelligent individual with enough brains to out think an entire alien invasion. He has about average physical strength though he seems to rely on his H.E.V suit for a lot of it.

* The H.E.V suit or hazardous environment suit full-body set of armor that protects from radiation, chemicals, bullets, and falling. It has a built in morphene and anti-venom dispenser as well as a gieger counter, zoom in feature, and flashlight. It allows a human to lift heavier object, sprint faster and longer, and even hold their breath for longer.



 Gordon Freeman from the end of half-life 2 episode 2:

* Similar to the on from HL1 but with more experience, also if he were to get his hands on the old Gordon's weapons he could use them perfectly whereas old Gordon couldn't do the same.

* The H.E.V suit has been modified to use auxiliary electricity from a small self contained generator. This allows him to run faster and swim longer. His flashlight uses yet another power source that can last for around 5 minutes. The upgraded suit also features improved armor and zoom enhancement.
 



The weapons of original Gordon are:

* a Glock 9mm pistol. (drawing from the same ammo as his SMG)

* a .357 magnum 6 round revolver with a speed loader.

* a Franchi-Spas 12 pump-action bottom loading 12 gauge shotgun.

* an MP5 submachine gun with a 50 round mag and a small on. contact grenade launcher mounted below the main barrel. (uses the same ammo as the pistol)

* 10 five second frag grenades.

* 5 remote detonation satchel charge's with detonator.

* 5 laser-tripwire mines.

* a laser-guided RPG with 5 explosive rockets.

* a crossbow with sedative darts and a long range scope.

* a gauss gun which can be charged to fire extremely dangerous energy energy beams capable of taking out a helicopter in one shot.

* a gluon gun which  fires a steady beam of high density energy, only has enough ammo to fire for around ten seconds.

* a hive-hand, a weapon used by aliens which fires small tracking bullets one at a time or rapid fires 8 non-tracking bullet's quickly, can only fire 8 bullets at any time but bullets are quickly regenerated.

* snark's, small alien insects which, when thrown go after an enemy and bit them, they explode after 10-15 seconds doing damage to all around them. though there is a chance they'll go after the user.

* And of course the classic crowbar which can be used for anything from breaking locks to opening crates to smashing skulls in.

The weapon's of the new Gordon are:

* A crowbar, simple, efficient, beautiful.

* A USP match 9mm semi-automatic pistol.

* A .357 magnum 6-shot revolver with speed loader.

* A Franchi-Spas 12 pump-action bottom loading 12 gauge shot gun.

* An MP7 SMG with a 45 round magazine and grenade launcher attached beneath barrel.

* A zero-point energy field manipulator, (or gravity gun for short) can pick up large and heavy objects and launch them.

* An overwatch standard issue pulse-rifle, Fires high caliber rounds at a high speed, extremely accurate, can also fire a ball of enrgy which disintegrates any living think it touches and should it fail to do that it bounces around off surfaces and explodes after a few seconds.

* An energy crossbow which fires a super-heated piece of medal at long range, has an extremely accurate scope.

* 5 MK3A2 high explosive grenades.

* A laser guided RPG with 3 rockets, capable of taking down a gunship in 3 shots.

* An antlion pheropod which can be used to control antlions to make them attack anything the user wish's.


The arena:

The opponents start out in a flat sandy field with a few antlions under it which are *not* in mating season.(they're not agressive just because you walk on sand) Surrounding the fields is a large forest with several combine building in it which house resupplies for ammo and health/energy. beyond the forest is an endless wasteland with no way to quickly cross it.
 
Both opponents start with full health and suit energy as well as full ammo and all of their weapons. New Gordon can use all of old Gordon's weapons perfectly though old Gordon would be using new Gordon's weapons for the first time.

It's a fight to the death and their both determined to win it. So only one question remains.

<TEXT> Spiritual satanist here. I'll elaborate on the chakra's in simple(ish) terms. If I leave anything out that you'd like to know feel free to PM me with more questions.

First. Imagine your body has energy flowing through it. Like water the energy goes from the top to the bottom following the path of least resistance. The path of least resistance in the human body is along the spine, you can see this purely medically in that the spine is where all the impulse travel going to the various muscles in the body's.

Chakra's a simply places where the energy bunches up and forms large pools of energy. Each chakra is attached to a humans emotional state in some way, the flow of energy affecting how you feel emotionally.

As the energy goes down it follows a path similar to a rainbow. with high energy violet rays where the energy starts and lower frequency after it has been diluted somewhat. This is why the chakra's are portrayed as (from top to bottom) violet, blue, cyan, green, yellow, orange, red.

[Here is a chart which displays how the chakra's are laid out as well as what emotion their commonly associated with](http://www.colourharmonie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/7-chakras-in-the-body-symbols-and-meaning-1024x810-meditationgongs.net_.jpg)

If the chakra's get a blockage in them it can seriously mess up the flow of energy in the body. the lower chakra's being starved and the higher chakra's being bloated with energy. This is why so many spiritual satanist's practice yoga, so as to clear up blockages and balance the energy in the body as well as increase overall power.

Now let's go into what each of the seven chakra's does.

First let's start with the lowest chakra. The root or the [Muladhara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muladhara) chakra. It governs all animal aspect of the body. Eating, drinking, sleeping ETC. It is also the most violent chakra and the one with the lowest vibration. It is also the chakra linked with fire.

Now onto the 2nd Chakra. The sacral chakra or [Swadhisthana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swadhisthana) this rules the animal urge of sex. Not many focus on empowering this chakra but this is probably the least developed for most people simply because of how society looks upon sex. And how many people associate sex with regret.

Now the third chakra, the solar plexus chakra or the [Manipura](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipura). This chakra is dominated by the son and is the one closest to satan. It also helps rule intuition and psychic energies. It is associated with fire.

Now the fourth chakra, the heart chakra or the [Anahata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anahata). This chakra is associated with all emotions but especially love. this and the sixth chakra are greatly over used in the new age culture, such that many new agers are imbalanced with this being bombarded by energy and focusing less on other chakra's. (remember balance is key)

Now onto the fifth chakra, the throat chakra. Or the [Vishuddha.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishuddha) This chakra rules expression. having an active throat chakra generally means your good at singing, painting, writing and other creative arts.

Now the sixth chakra, the Third eye chakra or the [Ajna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajna). This chakra is probably the one you've heard the most about as many just spam it with energy trying to develop psychic abilities very quickly. This chakra rules foresight and intuition as well as telepathy and telekinesis.

And finally, the seventh chakra. The crown chakra or, the [Sahasrara.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahasrara) This chakra rules your spiritual side and is your connection to the universe at large, as well as satan and the other gods. someone with a large amount of power in this chakra is usually very religious and connected to the earth and other around them.

Sorry if I left anything out but I had to condense over what would normally be 100,000 of letter's into a more manageable size (sorry if there's any spelling/grammar errors)but there's a LOT of stuff I left out. I encourage you to research this stuff yourself and form your own opinions of what lies before you on the path ahead.

[If I might recommend a good starting point](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheSpiritScience)

[Their episode on chakras](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhX6LoNZdAc) (they go pretty in-depth)

[And obligitory link to my groups website so you can check that out if your interested in satanism](http://www.angelfire.com/empire/serpentis666/HOME.html)

Thanks for reading through this incredibly long winded post (my longest one yet)

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Two rounds. both of which see the combine opening a portal in a relatively flat area and having one hour of prep time before the avengers get there.

Round 1:The avengers team from the first movie VS a (somewhat) small amount of combine forces. let's say, 10,000 or so. the combine are equipped the pulse rifles, mounted machine guns with kinetic barriers in front, SMG's, Shotguns, and grenades. (no gunships though.)

Round 2: The entire avengers team with all current and past members from every piece of avengers media (the comics, the movies and if there is any other media I'm not thinking of) VS A larger force of combine soldiers of about 50,000 normal combine soldiers with the gear listed above and about 10,000 elite combine, gunships, dropships, turrets and those tank/truck thing's. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The hammer and sickle design was the symbol of the soviet union representing the two main jobs in the union and giving power to the proletariat.

China never had that design. Also. I'm not even sure if the soviet union ever existed in the fallout universe meaning that that symbol might not even exist.

Anyone who saw you with it would thing your crazy.

<TEXT> How to change hit sounds? I'm currently playing a game with an un-armed character called Ken. Fist of the north rawr. Using the fist of the north rawr gauntlet as my weapon to destroy my enemies.

My question is this. How do I change the sound a weapon makes upon contact with an NPC? I looked in my steam FO:NV folder and couldn't find a folder for weapon sounds. If anyone knows than it would be much appreciated to tell me how.

(I plan on changing the hit sound for the fist of the north rawr weapon to the fast punching sound from the fist of the north star movie.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Try updating your video drivers sadly I can't direct you to the website you would do that at as that list is a list of possible specs and not absolute ones.

But say you got the model with the GeForce GT625 2GB then try searching "GeForce GT625 2GB video driver updates" into google without the quotation marks. To find out which card you have open up your start bar and right click on "My computer" on the drop down menu click properties and the window that comes up should have an option somewhere that says "Device manager"* click on that and expand the menu that says display adapters. Take the name that appears there and search google for video driver updates for that card. Install the updates and all of your games will run smoother not only NV.

*If your using win 8 then use [this guide](http://pcsupport.about.com/od/windows-8/a/device-manager-windows-8.htm) </TEXT>

<TEXT> This sounds like a pretty good idea. And once fallout 4 is released and a large influx of new people start playing 3/NV then it could serve as some form of guide for beginners.

I might as well contribute a tip myself.

Whenever your going through the wasteland at early levels, always pick up any junk you see so long as it doesn't over encumber you. You can always sell it for some caps. Even seemingly worthless things like dinner plates can help you when your saving up for that new gun. </TEXT>
