<TEXT> Simply just think it is a beautiful movie. The cinematography is phenomenal as well as the acting. Also love how it is about everything, such as knowing your place in the world, how others view you, what an ego can do, and mostly love how it explains what is flawed about modern blockbusters and movie goers and how most Michael Bay type explosion extravaganzas are just pointless cash grab, but Birdman really is a piece of art in my opinion that I have been waiting a long time to see. Hopefully that answered your question! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I like the Pixar movie "Cars". It's not my favorite Pixar movie of all time but I definitely do not think it is shit or isn't up to par on Pixar's usual films. I thought the movie was about much more than just winning a big race. To me it was about a full of himself race car who discovers how to be humble, grateful, and makes some quality friendships that he never would have made prior to his entering of Radiator Springs. That's just my opinion on the movie I simply want to know why some people don't care for it. Cars 2 was shit though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It kept me entertained from start to finish and the last thirty minutes of the movie felt like authentic Jurassic Park and it had the best ending I could have possibly hoped for. I had no problems with the acting, at some points the CGI looked a little cheesy but still did not take away from the film in my opinion. Were there some flaws? Yes. In the grand scheme of things did I think it was a solid action movie that excited me almost as much as Jurassic Park? Absolutely.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My build goes: 

Warrior Tabi
Executioner
Hide of the Urchin 
Witchblade 
Runeforged Hammer 
Qin Sais 

I think this is the perfect balance of defense, damage, and attack speed. It is important to have attack speed on Vamana because if you buy a creeping curse you can just simply obliterate your enemies. Then hide of the urchin corresponds with Vamana's passive so well, and Runeforged converts protection to damage which adds on to that. Hope this helped.

<TITLE> Scariest moment of my life. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-22 16:51:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Last night, me and my friends were all at at one friends house. We were going to smoke when it got darker and his dad went to sleep. His dad finally crashed right around 3:30 maybe 3. When the time came me and four other people had left to walk about a half a mile down the street to go to the woods where this was an old barn. I had smoked there before so I was familiar and had known it was a safe but two of the three had not. At every single sound they would say "What the fuck was that? We need to get the fuck out of here." Me and the other friend would say "Relax its just the sound of the earth." We had really good weed and we had done about two bowls and the three of us were really stoned. Unfortunately, we had a friend who usually was fine to smoke with but this time out of nowhere he started wobbling very subtle. I had noticed but didn't think anything of it, but then he started to turn ghostly white and I started to get a little worried. He then started wobbling like crazy and just in a faint whisper he said "catch me". He fell and hit the back of his head on the solid ground and he just blacked out and were all screaming his name hoping for him to get up because we knew if he had passed out we would have to tell our friends dad and possibly go to the hospital. Fortunately, he had awoken within the next thirty seconds and we had one friend hold his hand and walked home and we had gotten back to his friends house and played super smash bros after our blackout friend had fallen asleep for the night. Although we had gotten away unscathed it truly was one of the scariest moments of my life. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> League of Legends has it, Dota 2 has it, what about Smite? I know some may think that it could be a disadvantage; but I disagree. I mean, if you and another friend of yours want to join a ranked game and duo or just play together so you don't feel totally alone. Also, everybody else can do it as well. So pretty much everyone can get an advantage if they chose to play with someone. For me, it is more of just a comfort thing of knowing your friend is in the same game with you. Plus, you may work well with your friend if you two were to duo. It just discourages me because about 5 of my close friends all play smite and we constantly do premades, sieges, arenas, and assaults. Occasionally if someone isn't on we will play conquest. What do you guys think?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Sisters drug addiction and my moms struggle. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-04-08 04:38:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to post on. If it isn't give me the right one please but anyway. In January my family and I had discovered my sister had developed a nasty addiction to heroin and prescription pills. We sent her to rehab and she had gone for 4 months and she had just gotten out last week. The day she got out she relapsed, she started using cocaine. She had confessed to my parents and I. We had no clue what to do, so we started taking part in IOP (intensive out patient). She goes 3 times a week and gets tested, she has been passing but even so my parents have been super anxious, my parents are divorced. My dad does not show too much emotion but he does eat a lot of sugar and he has diabetes which is clearly not good for his health. My mom who I live with predominately has been pushing a lot of home renovations on herself and I. She said to me today "I rearrange furniture in my own house cause it is the only thing that I can control." I can't get it out of my head, it is just something that I thought was so deep. She does everything around the house and pushes way too much work on herself. My sister is in Vineland and then off to Woodbury if anyone knows where that is. I'm so anxious and so are my parents. Anything we can do you guys think we can do to calm our nerves? Thank you. </TEXT>
