<TEXT> At first I took offense for your comment, but in reality I shouldn't. You are absolutely correct that it is my fault for not taking the time to learn to read a book right. Upon further research, it isn't just me. The screw tape letters is just a hard book to comprehend, and that is the case with a lot of college freshman (based on amazon book reviews).
I'm not trying to stray off from the fact that you are correct about my laziness, but upon further inspection of your profile comments, you are just a redditor that takes satisfaction in humiliating others. Every other comment on your profile is mean and negative.  

Edit: Also, I made it pretty clear that it was a bad decision of mine to do what I did. I didn't ask for you to reiterate it. I asked if there were discussion groups for particular books where people like me can ask questions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, r/books, I am going to be 100% honest. I have never read a book in middle school or high school. I used spark notes for all of my quizzes and tests. This is now coming back to haunt me, but for the most part I am understanding The Golden String ( an autobiography). However, The screw tape letters is the most confusing thing I have ever tried to comprehend in my life. I know it is a pretty popular book, but for the life of me I have to study each and every sentence. What should I do? Are there any discussion groups that are linked to a book you are reading? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Im using the 960 just for premiere pro at a resolution of 2560x1600. I have gamed with it before, and it does run games like dota 2 and league maxed out at around 45-60 fps maxed out at native resolution. Triple AAA titles, not so much. Battlefield 4 is really only playable at 1600p at low/medium settings. 

tl;dr: 1080p gaming: 960 would run all games (with a few exceptions) at ultra settings 
         1440p or higher: 970 (would run all games at 1080p on maxed out settings easily). Turn down some of the graphics settings if you are playing at 1440p.

<TEXT> You can build a piratebox! It is basically your own personal cloud that requires no internet service to connect to. It uses a wireless router that emits a wireless signal (~$70), a storage medium (usually a flash drive around 16-128gbs) and a rechargeable battery. Once you have it all set up and flashed the bios, you can set it up with or without a password for people to connect to. When you turn it on, it should emit a wireless signal that most devices can connect to (the same way you connect to a wifi signal) and upload or download files that are stored on the hard drive. It is definitely a nice addition if you want to start a little intranet at your school for people to get answers to homework, or listen to that new song everyone has been talking about it and it happened to be uploaded by somebody around the premises. 

edit: Also, there is no app the devices have to download to upload or download files. You go to the internet browser on the device and the page that is pushed out by the piratebox automatically loads so it is web based. No downloading required. [Here is more information on what a piratebox is and what it does in more detail](http://lifehacker.com/5746102/build-a-pirate-box-for-mobile-and-secure-file-sharing) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I bent the ones on my z97n wifi motherboard by putting the usb 3.0 header from my case in the wrong way. It will bend the pins so bad if you dont line it up because there is a blocked off pin on the cable to "prevent" it from going in. I tried a straw and it was a bit to big, so i used the mini straw off of some canned air and carefully bent the pins back. Luckily, they work perfect now. </TEXT>

Just because you like to play games does not mean you will like to make them. That field is a big money maker for the small "ITT Tech" schools and they know that. So many people want to go into game design that you have to be the cream of the crop when it comes around to getting a job, or you have to hit it big as an indie developer. If I were you I would seriously reconsider your job path.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, definitely go with the 7770ghz. Go to pcpartpicker.com and filter the gpu selection out and it will find you the lowest price. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What is your budget? The best value for a gpu right now is the gtx 760 for the 200-300 dollar price range(if you SLI 2 of them together, it is a great deal more powerful than the 780.). If you want something sub 100 dollar range, get the 7770 ghz edition. The ghz edition ironically goes for less most of the time than the regular 7770. If you aren't looking for cuda cores for programs that will utilize them (adobe after effects, photoshop, fireworks, etc.) or are wanting to sli 2 or more gpus together then go amd. The 7770ghz pulls about 60 fps on high on battlefield 3 with buffs like anti-aliasing turned down. Hope i helped you out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, there are hardly any IDE interface ssd's and at that, it does not utilize the full speed of an ssd. You will have to buy another sata3 cable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As an AT T customer, i get a constant 20mbps down speed on my uverse line. Also with wireless, i enjoy having the ability to use data while talking on the phone simultaneously. Something other carriers can not provide. (try to call somebody and then go to google if you are on verizon and make sure your wifi is off).  I live almost right under an at t tower and get 35-40mbps lte data :). </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can say all you want but it is inconsiderate of people around you that have to get up and go to work in the morning with less than 5 hours of sleep. The mother and the person that used ignorant words like "fuck and hell" in his story length paragraph is unacceptable. If you have a child with mental disabilities, you should think about people around you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The pentium being a dual core, yes it would put a good limit on the 760s capabilities. I would go with at least a 3220 (it's a dual core with hyperthreading) if you are on a tight budget. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If he's gaming, he won't see the 30$ difference in the 6000 series.  It performs about 3% better in games than the 4300.  Also,  in response to not witty, the gtx 760 is nearly equivalent to a gtx 670. Your CPU is probably bottle necking your 760 slightly, but it's nothing that would be noticeable and I wouldn't go buy a new CPU over it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pcpartpicker.com is probably the site.

My general rule is:
CPU: if your using a gtx 760 or above go intel (4670k or 4770k are great CPUs)

If you go with a budget CPU anything up to a 660ti, go with the amd phnom ii x4 965 be or fx 4000 series.

Gpu:  if you are going to do 3 1080p monitors or go with one 1440p monitors, go with 2 gtx 760s in sli. If you are using one 1080p monitor, something from amd should suffice.

The gtx 760 has the best price/performance ratio at the moment and you can sli 3 of them. They also have a very high frame buffer so you won't notice microstuttering much. 2 gtx 760's in sli perform better than a gtx Titan for 500$ less.

Storage: Samsung 840 pro series for ssd.  Western digital caviar black for hdd.  I personally go for raid 0 hard drives over one ssd, so I have storage (2tb vs 128gb-256gb) and some speed to go along with it. 

Monitors: yamakasi cat leap. Find it on eBay, best value for a 120hz monitor.

If you need more help, go to the forums on pcpartpicker and go to partlistopinions wanted. I'm a regular on that sub forum and a lot of other people would be glad to help you :)! </TEXT>
