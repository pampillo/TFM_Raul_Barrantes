<TEXT> I can only partly understand your feelings OP. I'm 18, and my very first girlfriend, I had started dating at the beginning of December. She came off as quiet, but when she got used to you she would talk your ears off. She also warned me. Of how her past would be extremely difficult to work through. Like you, I thought I could handle it. But I was naive. I didn't go through the things you did (the late nights with her extremely depressed), but I did fully realize what 7 years of self-harm can do to a person. And how utterly and hopelessly depressed some people can be. I couldn't bring my self to love her the way she needed. It was far too taxing for my very first relationship, and it honestly scared the hell out of me. The self-harm made me push her away. I also tried to end it as soon as I realized, because I didn't want her feelings for me to deepen to the point where she feels the need to end it all. I was torn up in the break-up, and what made it worse is that I'm positive that instead of helping her condition, I only added more scars to her body and heart. It's a rough life. Good Luck to you man. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm currently struggling with a similar situation, and I can tell how she feels about me; but I am uncertain as to how I feel about her. It's a horrible feeling to think that you may be leading someone, who actually cares for you, on a fruitless journey, and how you may have to end the relationship sooner so they don't get hurt as much. </TEXT>
