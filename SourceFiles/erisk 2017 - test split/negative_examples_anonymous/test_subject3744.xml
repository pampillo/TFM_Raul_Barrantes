<TEXT> Doing a google search on the name "Dato Osepaishvili" is very interesting. Found a twitter that was created in 2011 and could be the same as OP pic that is 4 years younger. Accounts linked to a facebook and twitter accounts are all from Georgia. Not very legit solid evidence that it isn't a fake identity that has been created and has been used for other things to promote fake likes and followers.



Edit - /u/mario0318 did an extra click that i didn't and [found something even better to debunk this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3dj26p/this_was_my_friend_dato_osepaishvili_he_died/ct60lyb)

<TEXT> Did some searching because i have damaged some plastics with it before. I have used it in car audio for years to clean glue and stains from carpets. 

Found [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/1xurvh/ipad_cleaned_with_acetone/cfex21o) that explains which plastics are vulnerable to acetone. 

Acetone is great at dissolving common domestic polymers like polystyrene, polyethylene, PET etc, alcohols are pretty crappy at it. Acetone is also more likely to swell even specialized polymers

Also found [this on another forum](http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?70,84367,85439#msg-85439) that says it will dissolve acrylic which your counter top was most likely made of.

Hopefully someone that knows chemistry can explain why.

<TEXT> I'm normally not, but if you didn't start [being the prick first](https://www.reddit.com/r/rickandmorty/comments/3bk0he/episodes_1_and_2_are_leaked_from_season_2/csp73x0), I wouldn't have been an asshole. Maybe if you had any reading comprehension you would understand that my first comment was never saying anything about hulu. 

Yes your comment that i first replied to was about sitting through 30 second commercials was no big deal. My reply was stating that i have sat through so many commercials in my lifetime, i will do the most i can to avoid them completely. Had nothing to do with hulu.

You don't watch 18 minutes of ads on hulu, you watch 18 minutes of ads on cable. 

I never said anything about watching hulu.

Honestly, big deal. Perhaps many of you are younger, but if you told me 20 years ago that I could watch practically any show I wanted at my command for practically nothing ($8/month is nothing), and all I had to put up with was a few commercials, I'd have shit myself. It's not hard to put it on mute for 30 seconds. Seriously, there's worse things that could happen to you in life than having to endure a short ad.

You never even mention hulu in the comment i replied to. You could have been speaking of any streaming service. That's why i pay $11 a month for netflix. I don't ever want to see a commercial unless i absolutely have to. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You might have active sealife on the coasts and near the surface. You won't have life at the bottom like plants where all the chemicals settle. 

This is a problem associated with every delta in the world. It's just worst because the Mississippi river basin covers 47% of the continent of the US.

<TEXT> Your right. Most of the area around the Mississippi delta is pretty much dead. There is a ton of shit that comes down that river like pesticides/fertilizer used in agriculture that has killed a vast area of life around the delta.

Edit to add sources

http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/encyclopedia/dead-zone/?ar_a=1

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_zone_(ecology)

The area of temporary hypoxic bottom water that occurs most summers off the coast of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico [13] is the largest recurring hypoxic zone in the United States.[14] The Mississippi River, which is the drainage area for 41% of the continental United States, dumps high-nutrient runoff such as nitrogen and phosphorus into the Gulf of Mexico. According to a 2009 fact sheet created by NOAA, "seventy percent of nutrient loads that cause hypoxia are a result of this vast drainage basin."[15] which includes the heart of U.S. agribusiness, the Midwest. The discharge of treated sewage from urban areas (pop. c 12 million in 2009) combined with agricultural runoff deliver c. 1.7 million tons of phosphorus and nitrogen into the Gulf of Mexico every year.[15]

Edit - Should point out i'm not arguing the spill itself, but that the dead zone exists. </TEXT>

Did i say anything about hulu?

I hardly ever watch TV, only live tv i watch is pretty much sports. 

How do you think the content creators fund their projects?

No shit sherlock

If i like something i will actually buy the DVDs instead of sit through even a few 30 seconds commercials on hulu.

I will wait months to watch something on netflix instead of seeing it the day after it airs even with a few commercials.

<TEXT> In CA is illegal for them to expire unless they were given out for a promotion or to employees.

Most gift certificates and gift cards sold by retail sellers for use with the seller and its affiliates cannot contain an expiration date or a service fee, including a fee for dormancy.

and is pretty much considered legal tender, since it basically is a pre-paid credit card.

Any gift certificate sold after January 1, 1997, is redeemable in cash for its cash value, or subject to replacement with a new gift certificate at no cost to the purchaser or holder.4 Effective January 1, 2008, any gift certificate with a cash value of less than $10 is redeemable in cash, which includes currency or check, for its cash value.

<TEXT> In 2009, Congress passed the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act, which set consumer protections for gift cards based on many state laws. The law provides that gift cards cannot expire within five years from the date they were activated and generally limits inactivity fee on gift cards except in certain circumstances, such as if there has been no transaction for at least 12 months. The federal law creates a floor for regulation and leaves room for state regulation on redeeming gift cards for cash and unclaimed property provisions.

Is the burning sensation normal? I'm assuming it is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I estimate that this was retired only after 8 years. I worked in a plastic factory and I assume that this would do 4 cycles a min. Times that by 60 for an hour, times that by 24 for a day ( most plastic factories run 24/7 due to the fact that the injectors would fill with hard plastic if left off over night ) then times that by about 365 gives you about 134 million bricks. Now I say 8 years cause there is down time for maintainiance and colour changes. If anyone has a better time frame I would like to know what you think.

Even just watching the video made me want to slow down seeing the traffic merge. He practically drove into her blind spot.

Don't get me wrong, the PT is completely at fault.

<TEXT> If OP were to apply the brakes (not slam on them) and make a move to the left lane, that PT wouldn't have hit OP. Why is his first reaction to just honk the horn? If you are a defensive driver you would be letting off the gas and slowing down and ready to hit the brakes moments before OP just honks his horn. OP didn't even try to slow down even after he honks.

Even if there was a car in the next lane that OP hits trying to evade, he has video evidence he was trying to avoid an accident.

20 years of driving defensively i haven't been in any accidents, and have been in OP's situation many times. Don't expect other drivers to be paying attention at all times, especially when they are merging in the lane next to you. </TEXT>

hoping the impact might be a bit lighter

OP had enough time to realize what was happening for him to honk his horn, instead of making a controlled maneuver to evade. By the time the other driver has time to realize what the honk was for, OP could have got into the other lane. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why didn't you try to evade him instead of honking your horn?

Edit - ~~I'm not going to try to argue this anymore~~, this accident could have been avoided if OP was a defensive driver.

edit2 - Just realized that another comment was downvoted to hell for saying the samething.

/u/Malfeasant describes [this perfectly](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roadcam/comments/3ackon/pt_cruiser_owners_are_the_worst_drivers/csbiu80). If any of you have ever ridden a motorcycle you would understand. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Even if this quote "rifle behind every blade of grass" isn't really made by Isoroku Yamamoto, it speaks the truth.

 In 1960, Robert Menard was a commander aboard the USS Constellation when he was part of a meeting between United States Navy personnel and their counterparts in the Japanese Defense Forces.
Fifteen years had passed since VJ Day, most of those at the meeting were WWII veterans, and men who had fought each other to the death at sea were now comrades in battle who could confide in each other.
Someone at the table asked a Japanese admiral why, with the Pacific Fleet devastated at Pearl Harbor and the mainland U.S. forces in what Japan had to know was a pathetic state of unreadiness, Japan had not simply invaded the West Coast.
Commander Menard would never forget the crafty look on the Japanese commander's face as he frankly answered the question.
'You are right,' he told the Americans. 'We did indeed know much about your preparedness. We knew that probably every second home in your country contained firearms. We knew that your country actually had state championships for private citizens shooting military rifles. We were not fools to set foot in such quicksand.' </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cigarette breaks were an intermittent part of my work day.

Every job i've had let me choose when to take my breaks, didn't even matter if i went out and have a quick smoke whenever i wanted.
I've never actually tried to quit. The longest i went without a smoke was 2 days after 15 years, and that was because i was in jail. 

I have a computer in my garage for i can smoke n surf the web. Just rearranged my room to fit my desk and computer in there earlier. Desk and computer are going in tomorrow and will try to quit cold turkey. I just happened to catch your post on /r/all/new and wanted to give you support.

<TEXT> HOWEVER, the video does show several other people attempting to either get the girl off the ground (interfering in police work), or something a bit more nefarious.

Would agree the actions leading up to that point would warrant a show of force, but think he should have defended himself with pepper spray instead. He was putting himself in danger trying to detain someone that was "running their mouth."

The good news here is that no one was hurt.

Couldn't agree more

<TEXT> Even if he is right, just shows that this community and HOA have views that go against the grain. Yes it might be private property and they had every right to call the cops. The way it was handled was the opposite of what the nation saw as right. 

The blame really comes down to the original person to tweet out that there was a pool party. A young inexperienced promoter decides to turn a private pool party into a rave and have a DJ show up? Would seem most of the blame would be on the original graduate, that lives in that community, that invited a couple friends over against the rules of that community. </TEXT>

The Games were also financially successful raising more money with fewer sponsors than any prior Olympic Games, which left SLOC with a surplus of $40 million. The surplus was used to create the Utah Athletic Foundation, which maintains and operates many of the remaining Olympic venues.

<TEXT> Traffic on the 5 can move at a fast pace. About 10 years ago i was driving north to see some friends. Had a corvette pass me doing about 100 so i sped up and just matched his pace. We probably went 50 miles at that speed, granted i had a radar detector and i guess he did as well. The vette crested a hill and immediately started to slow down, as soon as i crested i got a laser warning. After we were out of view we sped back up again.

I've even seen packs of 5+ cars being pulled over by a single CHP before. </TEXT>

<TEXT> US heavy bombs are all now gps guided, they don't need to carpet bomb like vietnam anymore. B-52s can hit a separate target with each bomb it has at the same time.

In WW2 the US didn't have precision bombs. Altitude and wind currents would miss targets by miles. That is why whole cities were bombed. The only cities that were bombed were considered industry that supported the Axis,  cities weren't carelessly bombed at random.

<TEXT> The group was founded in 1949 and grew organically before expanding rapidly through a series of acquisitions in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and was formerly known as the Ratner Group.

Gerald Ratner who built it from 130 stores to 2500, a previous CEO, made possibly the most famous gaffe in twentieth century British business when he explained to a major business conference that the reason why one of his products was so cheap was that it was "total crap". He then went on to unfavourably compare some of the company's earrings with a 99p prawn sandwich. His remarks were gleefully reported by the media, The company lost over 500 million pounds off its share price and consumers subsequently avoided the Ratner branded stores, nearly 300 of which were closed between January 1992 and May 1994 as the group went through a financial restructuring. Ratner resigned in November 1992 and the group changed its name to Signet Group plc in September 1993.

The company moved its primary stock market listing from the London to the New York Stock Exchange on September 11, 2008, changing its name to Signet Jewelers Limited in the process.[4] The firm also moved its country of domicile from the United Kingdom to Bermuda on the same day,[5] although it retains operational headquarters in the Jewellery Quarter, Birmingham.

Company have a bad name? Just rename it and move it to a new location.

Investigators say the man used a cigarette lighter to ignite gas fumes when he got back into his car.

"My initial impression is based on the fact he was at a gas station, it was probably gasoline, we got some samples we took from inside the car and will send out to the state arson lab to see what exactly burned up inside there, said AFD Capt. Andy Reardon. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I have to say that I liked the other ones better. This was too blatantly political for my taste.

Hopefully they are going to attack both sides in the same way because they are pretty heavy handed. The Mitch McConnell video is the same.

This video is part of the first 3 they made, probably testing the waters on what they can say. The yoga guy was made only yesterday. In the comment section they are asking who they should make one for next. Hopefully they get more neutral as they make more videos. </TEXT>

 You local gas station pumps don't give you the amount of gas that you paid for, you realize this and report it to the county. They send out the county weight and measurements department and test it.

Find a group that includes other parents with autistic kids. Hopefully find some friends within that group that can relate to your family. I'm sure they can help with a vacation that can suit your family and needs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't think looking at their own reflection is a good example. Maybe kittens that have never seen a mirror before react to the reflection but that is just their nature running into another cat they don't recognise. I've never had any of my cats after their first experience with a mirror react that way the next time they experience it. My cat Pizza loves to sleep in the bathroom, and most of the time when you come in he will look at you through the mirror. When i start getting close enough to him he will turn his head and look at me directly.

Wasn't there a "Through the wormhole with Morgan Freeman" episode where they were talking about when humans become self conscious? One of the big factors was recognizing themselves in a mirror? </TEXT>

The building's security guard, who is stationed at the entrance, noticed the beagle dog was acting odd before they entered the building's elevator, according to the property manager. At that time, the security guard watched a live video feed from the surveillance video located in the elevator on a monitor stationed near the entrance desk.

safe to say it is the right company. </TEXT>

Do you have a source for that? I searched and the best results were all on whack job conspiracy sites and it wasn't even a real source. I've worked on elevators and i hardly doubt that.

Was there black smoke in the OP video?

<TEXT> [This map](http://i.imgur.com/8cSk8ye.jpg) shows it better than i can explain it but it isn't exactly to scale. Mainly has do with geography of the area of the LA basin. The southern most point of the california aqueduct ends at [silverwood lake](https://goo.gl/maps/Xk0Je) which feeds the high desert mainly Hesperia/Victorville. You can see the aqueduct in the top of the google map link.

The colorado aqueduct feeds into [lake Mathews](https://goo.gl/maps/qQgvj) in Riverside. You can't see the aqueduct in the supplied link because it mostly runs underground after it reaches the mountains [around here](https://goo.gl/maps/JwVJF) via the San Jacinto tunnel.

On the first map i link, i live in that area marked as groundwater to the east of LA. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No shit? If you are aggressive on the way you pursue them it is just going to make them drive even more insane. Exactly what this video shows. He could have tried to keep his distance which at the 4 minute mark he was told to do so but ignored it. Even saying traffic wasn't as bad as it actually is, if you can't safely narrow down a search area after you break off a pursuit, then you don't have enough officers that clearly are needed.

It isn't like the bank robber went in and shot the place up like north hollywood. Once he robs a bank the FBI are involved, no reason to jeopardise my family or your family to capture a guy that can get away with a few thousands dollars only to be captured in a better and easier way later. Why escalate a deadly situation even more by provoking a suspect? Up until the end a single officer was in pursuit of a vehicle and it caused more danger to the public than putting a dangerous bank robber into custody.

edit - I love how you immediately downvote because you disagree

Edit - Even at the 4 minute mark the other officer says to disengage the pursuit and the main officer says copy, but continues to pursue when it gets the most dangerous.  </TEXT>

The original key goes inside the box and gets hidden in the dash, then has a transmitting wire that feeds the unique keyfob up to the cylinder. You can use any kind of metal key after you set this up.

<DATE> 2015-05-12 09:07:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The two recommended to me were [Buffalo Grass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouteloua_dactyloides) or [Zoysia grass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoysia).

Currently most of my lawn is at least 4 different types, Mostly invaded by crabgrass, which  results in [this](http://i.imgur.com/C98MKpw.jpg). After renting an industrial power rake.

My whole lawn has a mixture of permanent shade and sun.

Please help...

edit - i know St Augustine is used around here a lot, will have to use the identification tool to find how what types i have currently, the shaded areas are different type than the ones in the sun. I also need to get rid of the shade that is currently there, the two trees that provide the shade are very old and termite infested. They are on the curbside, and would have to get the city to remove them. </TEXT>

Edit - i worked a service job so it wasn't always from west LA, it was wherever my day ended, some being better than others. At least if it was bad enough i could get a motel room somewhere and be compensated for it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Youtube and netflix have been giving me all kinds of problems lately. In the last 24 hours they have slowed to a crawl and don't even load. The last year or two i have had the same issues but never this bad. I feel like verizon is trying to piss me off.

http://imgur.com/a/vWgHc

This happens with any of my systems including xbox and playstation. I've reset my router, but with my limited knowledge the tracert says it isn't even my end of the network.

thanks

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I don't have pictures at the moment, but can take some tomorrow.

While researching what product i should get, i came across [this.](http://www.alphasystemsinc.com/ProductCare) 


 Rubber roof (also known as EPDM) membranes are smooth. TPO and Alpha-Ply roof membranes have a haircel texture, which can be likened to an orange peel.


Was looking at [this product](http://www.epdmcoatings.com/rv-roof-repair.php) and it says 


 For Fleetwood models with ALPHA roofs you will need to use the ProFlex Primer



I'm pretty sure mine is a TPO/Alpha-Ply type roof since it is a Fleetwood and then would need to put down a primer before the rubber coating. The top of the RV is black in color and is not smooth so this makes me think it is not a rubber roof.


This seems the best way to fix it. 

Edit - am back from getting beers </TEXT>

<TITLE> Insulin options for a diabetic cat? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-18 00:07:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was curious what everyone else uses for insulin for their cats. I've been using a bottle of lantus since my vet diagnosed him with diabetes, but it is almost out. The vet said he had ordered it by mistake and would let me have it for $50. When I checked the price for a bottle at the local CVS they want $230.

I've been told about many other options but would like some input from the real catlovers.

<TEXT> I've noticed a few new accounts that have been posting lately in /r/pics and /r/funny and saw a familiar routine with a few of them. Going through the post history of these accounts led me to

/r/usedcarsforsale which is a fairly new sub and if you notice all the posts being made are by user accounts that are only a few weeks old.

if you look at some of the users that post in that sub, you will see that they are trying to post generic photos for exposure and also post the used car ads to the used car sub.
