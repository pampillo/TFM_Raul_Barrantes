<TEXT> Frag, your sarcasm is quite hilarious, but you're missing my point, and inventing another. I didn't say anything about the game needing to be "happy fun time." I understand that there will be bandits. It's the fact that the zombies are completely unimportant to these guys. In a real *zombie* apocalypse, yes, there would be bandits, and people battling each other, but they'd have to account for the zombies. How is this not obvious? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand what you're saying quake, but the game is a zombie sandbox for a reason. Am I wrong? These firefights are interesting to be a part of I'm sure, but the guy has a zombie right on top of him eating him and he basically ignores it. How is that not ruining the game? He isn't playing it how it was intended to be played. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm inclined to agree. When you take out the zombies you just revert to Arma. It's so boring that way. These players are the kind of people that ruin the game. It's a zombie mod, not a new map for arma.

<TEXT> After watching every season of gossip girl it makes me think that if we were born with a trust fund we would have grown up differently, and choose different paths then we are on now.

That said, someone said something about college. I can hardly afford it now. I would never have to worry about tuition again, and i would just learn. Then use that knowledge for society. 

At least that's what i say. I don't know what i would do of i *actually* had money. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have to disagree with him (PREPARE THE DOWNVOTE CANNONS) because grades are extremely important when it comes to scholarships for me. I have to maintain at least a 3.2 for one of my scholarships, and a 3.5 for another. Kids will complain that teachers will test over something they didn't cover, and usually it's just the dumbass kid not paying attention, but I've experienced it myself. I write down every word the professor says and everything he writes on the board. Sometimes you get a bad professor who actually does not test over what he teaches. Also, this is just for me personally, but when I get bad grades when I work extremely hard not to, I get extremely down trodden, and I feel like I'm in the wrong major. Grades are very, very important to me, because if I lose my scholarships, I lose not only my education but my apartment as well, and then I would have to live with my parents, and nobody wants that!

I understand hand outs are the bane of the education system, but for the people who actually do study hard for the grade, then get shafted due to poor test questions, I can also understand the frustration and anger. Luckily, as I get farther into my degree, I'm escaping the graduate students who are only copying a paper to the board and have no idea what they're talking about. This professor sounds like he thinks he knows everything, which would be frustrating as well. Especially that term "mommified." That's very unfair to the single moms or even the ones who aren't who work extremely hard to raise their kids right. 

Quick edit: I do have the ability to think by the way. We are given concepts and we have to think of how they work and where they came from. Even these things aren't on the tests sometimes. I'm in engineering, so that may be part of it. </TEXT>

The first one is pointless but I'm adding it anyway. It just shows what I get when I am at the storage tab. Clicking Disk Management gives me the second image. I opened the disk's properties window in case you needed that. I have the option to change drive letter and paths in case that's important. Thanks for the help so far!

Also, the disk is slightly transparent in the first image if you look at the My Computer window. Idk if that is relevant. </TEXT>

We all suffer in some way or another, but if we stick together we can get through these things. I'm growing used to relationships being the way they are, but I look at the many people who have great, lasting marriages rather than those who are single or are divorced.

<TEXT> This story was awesome and really cheered me up for the first half. I know the ending is completely awful, but reading the first half made me feel like their is some awesome things in this world when you disregard the bad (I know that isn't easy). I'm not telling you to just ignore what happened with that girl. I get incredibly low when this kind of things happens to me. But you always have those things to be proud of.

Music was my thing for a long time. I was in a band, produced an EP. Things were going good. Then, I had to go to college (because lets face it, the band wasn't going anywhere), and my dad wouldn't pay for college if it meant I was going for anything music (btw, he is a good dad, he just knows that I had no chance). I'm very jealous of your life right now driving the car you drive and being in a successful band.

I hate when people tell me to look at the silver lining when I'm angry or feeling down, but I know it's the best thing to do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a human that has lived with sight for at least 20 years of my life, I can confirm that the moon does in fact illuminate the world by reflecting the light of the sun. According to DayZ, the moon is a large white dot in the sky that hardly does anything else. I would understand the extreme darkness of the night during a new moon, but there would seriously be MUCH more light, even in the woods, when the moon is out.

Source: I've been outside where there are no other sources of lights (buildings, lamps, etc.) and I could see things.

Okay I know I'm joking a lot, but really. Any word on a *little* bit more light for us night walkers? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sorry, I feel like I should add to the conversation now that I'm at a computer. Connor, if it's not too late, here are my suggestions, and the way my team does it:

 - First of all, if you're going to use DayZ Database, be warned, it's not 100% correct. We use it, but we're careful. Here's what you do. Go to the wiki entry ([UAZ dayz wiki](http://www.dayzwiki.com/wiki/UAZ)) of a particular vehicle, let's say the UAZ. Scroll down and look to the right under the picture where it says rarity. This tells you how many to expect. If it doesn't give you an exact number, just make an assumption. If it says rare and their are 8 spawns on the map, assume 2 or 3 exist.

 - Second, use your dayzdb map to search for the UAZ only. Hit each of the spawn points. This is slow, and not perfect, but it's a good way to check if vehicles are on the server. If you play a low pop server then they will most likely be there. There is a chance they will already be gone, but that's just something you'll have to deal with.

Another way to do it is to uncheck everything except vehicles on the dayzdb map and follow the south coast starting at kamenka, and check every spawn along the coast of Chernarus. A friend and I did that and we didn't find one until we hit Solnichniy. Finding vehicles is a slow process, just keep at it. If you think you are just absolutely not finding vehicles that should be there, it's the server. Find a new one.


Pretty reliable locations for me: Vyshnoye for the GAZ and the south, slightly west bicycle spawns. GAZ has always been there for me, and the bikes are usually there.  </TEXT>

My fear drives me to do better so that I'm not put in an impossible situation. Take hold of it and use it to take charge of your life.

My friend lost 170 pounds once. He told me the thing that helped the most was watching his diet closely, but he also took thermogenics. To my knowledge they increase your internal temperature helping you burn fat faster, or something like that, and they're safe. You could definitely try those if you're looking to lose wait. Gets a lot more out of a simple treadmill work out!

There are plenty of jobs that will hire you without a high school education. They may not be glamorous, but you have options at least. I may be wrong because I live in America, but I bet Australia is a pretty good place too. You could try to work for a [video gaming company out in Australia since you have a passion for video games.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Video_game_companies_of_Australia) That link is a list of companies in Australia you could look into it. You'd probably need some coding education from a university before that pans out, but at least it's a goal!

Any good ideas? I was thinking something like tiles, but the tiles would have to be big so the grout isn't in the way. Lighter would be nice, but not necessary. Any ideas would be great! I can take pictures of the actual desk if need be. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Temperature isn't active as far as I know, but if you swim long enough you can catch a cold apparently. You have to take antibiotics to counteract that, which are apparently quite rare.

If it makes you feel any better, I left my vehicle hidden among some trees the other day, and ran up the hill a ways to log out for the night. When I logged back in, I spawned standing in the vehicle, with a broken leg, and when I tried to move backwards I instantly died. The game has it's bugs, but I think we can still enjoy it! Just learn what the bugs are, and try to steer clear of them, like driving an ATV over a bridge. That is also apparently instant death haha </TEXT>

<TEXT> First of all, the pain indicator is when your character goes into shock. That wears off after 5 minutes and doesn't go away until then. Shakiness is pain which can happen from a lot of things, like a broken leg or just being hit by a zombie. Take painkillers to shop the shakes. You can be bleeding without needing painkillers, and you can be in pain without bleeding. Just make sure you're not bleeding first, then take care of everything else.

Second, vehicles are very buggy. Your tractors seem to be the worst I've heard. Buses and cars can run over fences without really taking any damage. General rule of thumb for me, if you can't fit through a town without hitting something, go around it through the grass. Good luck bru_tech </TEXT>

Though it's painful that she won't say it back (I swear she was going to, she basically said she loved me in different words [I love everything about you, etc.]) it's something that she needs to hear, and it's the truth. I feel it, and if it takes the rest of my life to show her she is loved, it'll be a life well spent to me.

<TEXT> From what I've read, seen, and experienced, it does. A friend of mine has recently been hit with depression and I've been doing a lot of research reading books and talking to professionals about it so I can learn how to help her. They all claim that it is something that can be treated.

Also, for a personal experience, both my father and sister have bipolar disorder/manic depression, which though they are not exactly the same as depression, they are similar, and both are better with medication. I know relying on medication isn't always something people are interested in, but I'm willing to bet it's better than the alternative.

Stay as positive as you can and seek professional help, they're professionals for a reason! One of my favorite proverbs: "However long the night, dawn will break."

I laughed pretty hard at this, as did the hundreds of others who upvoted it.

Let me break it down to you why it is funny. Any typical week on Reddit (maybe any day), there is a time where there are posted about three or four successful posts that follow the same paradigm. Then, like clockwork, someone posts a joke that fits the paradigm but doesn't fit the same use of the previous posts. This guy did it flawlessly, but because he is not Trapped in Reddit or Shitty Watercolor (no offense to you guys), you guys grab your pitchforks. Calm the fuck down and just laugh and move on.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> While in a populated (16 or so) room, one of my buddies got shot from the tree lines, while my other friend and I were looting a small room. We closed the doors and sat and waited, planning our escape. We do not usually kill. My buddy is a hero and I'm making my way up there. 

We didn't want to engage, we just wanted to flee. Before we open the back door to leave, we hear, "Hello? Is anyone in there?" in an eerie voice. Buddy takes a knee watching the back door with a Mk.48 and I prone watching the front with an AK-74. As soon as I see him open the door I unloaded my entire mag into his head, which was perfectly lined up with my crosshairs. He runs into the room, I reload while my friend fires the Mk.48 into his chest. As he is running back out I unload on him as he says, "Okay, I'll close your door, sorry."

Friend calls out, "Hacker, back out!" So we both Alt+F4. I know you guys don't like that, but we're not losing our survivors to a hacker. Is it most likely that this guy was a hacker since he would not die with that much lead in him? I don't really know how to identify them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've only seen the A-10/Frogfoot in the games so far (I'm not a jet pilot). They do okay against it. If this helps, I've used the gunner's cannon on the helicopter, it did around 27% damage after firing probably 3 or 4 full volleys against it, not missing. It takes about 6-7 stingers to take it out.

The gunship's ability to kill everything with one hit with almost perfect accuracy is what makes it so aggravating. If the pilot is on top of things (which isn't hard to be), the pilot can kill anyone at the plants, and anyone spawning trying to take it out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not one to complain about Battlefield often, but the AC130 is a serious problem. Don't comment if your not going to be constructive. 

"YOUR A STUPID FAGGOT NOOB."    or
"LEARN 2 PLAY"
comments are unnecessary.

The gunship is way too powerful. The splash damage is too high. It kills people inside buildings without completely obliterating the buildings. It respawns practically immediately after it is shot down. It requires at least two Stinger carriers to effectively bring it down before it annihilates your whole team, with the explosives perk. Then you need a support gunner to fill you up as soon as you're out. That takes three men out of the battle. And it can kill you when you spawn in deployment.

It needs to be either A) Nerfed to hell, B) Completely removed from the game, or C) only allowed on certain maps/game modes with a much lower spawn frequency.

Downvote me if you have to, but I want opinions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It did sound like you were attacking me, and I apologize for fighting back, I was still frustrated by the game. Yes, good thing I know now, won't leave home without it! It probably was a proximity thing. I'll be as cautious as possible next time.

I think the difference between us on point 2 is that I play in empty servers every chance I get. I, unlike most people, prefer to play a zombie survival game rather than a bandit survival game, because I sincerely believe humans won't be murdering each other in the apocalypse but trying to stick together. We read somewhere online that certain vehicles were vanishing on certain versions of servers, and we tested it to verify it. They respawn back where you found them, without your items in them, but in the same condition (fuel, wheels, etc.) as you left them. 

"3." Okay, I admit. We were virtually making out... We'll stop that...

I haven't learned the aggro ranges for zombies when it comes to sight yet. It seems a little uneven at times so I prefer to hide rather than walk through towns.

All in all, have an upvote for giving me advice. I'm no longer frustrated so I can take your advice willingly and not feel like you are disagreeing just to disagree. Thanks biscuit! </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. Yeah, didn't know what Morphine was at this point. Never had to use it until those moments. I was in third rounding the corner, and he happened to be at the corner of the door right as I turned it. It didn't have to do with my cautiousness.
2. I disagree about the searching the outer woods. I never do it, and most of the players I ever see are playing in cities or the inner woods. I'm not stupid enough to hide it in the inner woods near cities. We don't play on highly populated servers anyway. The bus wasn't stolen, it vanished because of the known glitch.
3. We stick close to each other so we know where each other is located, and we role play. We were walking down a thin alley that didn't have much room to move around. Your argument is invalid. We don't play PVP anyway.

There is no reason to ever crawl unless you're role playing or goofing off.

I 100% disagree with this. I usually role play, so yes I will be crawling, but even if I'm not, it's usually the only way to go through a town during the day without being seen by a zombie.

Finally, we play the game to make it feel real. Killing myself and respawning is stupid and not enjoyable. If my leg is broken, I have to have my buddy come back to get me. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Day one, I'm doing fine, enjoying myself with a buddy. Have quite a few cooked steaks, good enough weapons. We're in a barn, and when we're ready to leave, I crouch walk out the door (no zombie sounds at all), and one appears around the corner right when I exit and when he turns to me my leg is instantly broken. Luckily buddy killed him, but it took an hour to get to a place that had morphine (we were near the sobors, and guess what, no morphine anywhere).

Day two, find a bus, go hide it in a very, very remote area, and when we come back, it's gone. If someone took it, that's fine, but the area was remote enough where it seemed like it just vanished because of how the game works.

Day three, crouch walking with a buddy, skirting the left side of a small building, him on my left, and all of a sudden I die from what I assume was him pinching me against the wall. We were hardly moving, and I was probably at 10,000 health, good on everything. I just died instantly.

Same day, a bit after I respawn from the above death, I'm crawling through a doorway (forgive me for being ignorant to this happening) and I break my leg somehow. Crawling straight through it mind you, not trying to turn or anything. Friend is all the way up at the NW airfield, and has to run the 10,000 meters to get to me and administer morphine. I was crawling towards the Cherno hospital (spawned near Elektro, made it to the southwest end of Cherno before I broke my leg). He beat me to it.

Hours of games lost because of random broken legs. Needless to say, first priority every day now is having 20 morphine in my bag at all times.

**TL:DR - Break my legs and die randomly from the environment acting unnaturally. This being addressed in the standalone?**

PS - I love this game, and I hate to complain. But I want to play it in relative peace, and these bugs make me afraid to move anywhere close to my buddy, buildings, etc. </TEXT>

It's just silly how they did that. We wanted to get everything ourselves too, so we never used the international trading system thing. I will be buying the new games, but SS had the best interface imo. Transferring pokemon in boxes with the touch screen? WHY REMOVE THAT? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I want to play again so bad... But I was so close. We both were. We need maybe 30 more Pokemon to complete the National Dex, but they're the stupid ones like Spiritomb or the ones you can only evolve after you have fed them skittles on Route 40 at Sunrise while holding twelve ethers in your backpack. Should we leave our games as they are, monuments to hours of hard work and determination, or should we allow ourselves to experience the joy of starting the best games out of the series over again?

Btw, we have no shinies, but I got the Pokerus, and we have the code-only ones like Mew, and we also have the ones that you have to work for like Feebas. </TEXT>

It was only last Sunday when she was over, smiling, and we were perfectly fine. And she doesn't lie well, so I would know if she was hiding something. Is changing that fast common?

<TEXT> **TL:DR: My girlfriend was diagnosed by a therapist with depression, and she is trying to push me away. I read that that was one of the symptoms and I need to stop her from doing that. What should I do?**

My girlfriend just started seeing a therapist (she has been to one session, her therapist was sick so she had to cancel the second) and she was already diagnosed with depression on the first visit. It's extremely frustrating for me right now because she is trying to push me away and isolate herself because she thinks she is just going to bring me down. I'm afraid she will push me away until she thinks I won't want her back no matter what I say.

I don't know what to do... Should I just be patient with her and hope the therapy sessions work? We were very serious about our relationship , and not three days ago everything was perfect. She all of a sudden snapped one day and completely locked up. She lives a bit away from me so I don't get to see her as often as either of us would like, but it's mostly because of her work schedule. She works way too much, so much that she pretty much works dawn to dusk six days a week and she doesn't have to, and it hurts her sleeping schedule.

She is at the point where she already won't listen to me because she thinks things are hopeless and just wants to give up. She isn't normally like this. She is usually the happiest person in the world, bringing immense joy to anyone around her. I'm worried about her well-being. I need to know if I should just be patient and let her do what she needs to do, or if I should prevent herself from pushing away the people in her life who care about her. I'm at a loss. Please, someone help me. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I managed to reach the Chernarus International Airfield about an hour ago, armed with a crossbow and two bolts. After killing a couple of zombies and two of them unfortunately falling on top of the bolts, I was left without those precious arrows I love so much. With a useless weapon, I decided to discard it in the bushes and grab my ax.

I spent a good amount of time searching the ENTIRE airfield. Not a building was left unchecked. The first weapon I found was an AKS Kobra, which was great, but I *really* wanted a silenced weapon. So I left it be, and continued to the other end of the airfield. After finding about 6 AKs and AKMs, a shotgun or two, and about 3 G17s, I decided to make my way back to the AKS with a Kobra. After reaching the spot where I had originally found it, I discovered I had somehow managed to completely overlook an M14 AIM lying in the same building. Tears rolled down my face. I still feel new to the game, and this was the greatest thing I could have found.

I leave the building (I assume was the barracks) and head to the tall hangar building. I climb the ladder to the very top most point and decide to try out my rifle. I snipe quite a few zombies, amazed at the accuracy of the weapon, only to hear grunts like I was hurt. I thought, there is no way a zombie could have gotten me. I was surrounded for sure, but I know I was at a safe distance from them up the ladder I had climbed. The glitchy polygons were getting annoying, so I disconnected and reconnected from the server. Don't know what I thought that would help, but at least the zombies were gone.

I head down to the roof below and look over the edge to see a survivors body. Those were the grunts I heard. I felt so bad. He had an AK on him and perhaps he was saving his own life by not shooting me in the middle of a zombie-infested airfield, but it seemed more like he was hoping I would befriend him and fight alongside him. My jubilation at finding a rifle and practicing with it brought the hordes around him, before he could climb the ladder, and he was murdered right under my nose without me knowing. I could have helped him. I had plenty of cooked steaks, bandages, painkillers, and some morphine I found in the Elektro hospital. I did not want his sacrifice to go to waste, so I grabbed the GPS off his body, left the rest in case he came back, and headed into the forest to take a break.

**TL;DR: I got you killed at the NW airfield for firing my new rifle and I'm very sorry. I took your GPS. I get lost easily... Sorry again.**  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I started 4 days ago. My fear of zombies is so great I was too crippled to play the first three days. Those first moments consisted of me finding a hatchet, but being too afraid to approach a zombie. Being too afraid to enter the woods. Being too afraid to enter towns. Basically, the coast was my sanctuary. By the fourth day, I found myself on the far West side of the island, near Zelenogorsk, with one fellow survivor.

After 30 minutes of running towards the north western edge of Zelenogorsk to find a lake that we were told would be there, I happen across a truck. This truck belonged to no one. It was spawned, missing two tires, no engine, and an empty fuel tank and damaged hull. We spend the next two hours moving back and forth between Zelenogorsk, the lumber yard, and the location of our truck, finding the necessary materials to repair the vehicle. When we finally finish, I'm armed with an Enfield, he a shotgun, and our truck houses our high quantities of sodas, cans of food, and essentials, like bandages. It also held our M4A3 and a CZ 550. This truck was sanctuary. We made the decision to rendezvous with two other friendlies at the far Northeastern edge of the map, where they had no vehicle and wanted to be transported.

After 2.5 long hours, we hop in our truck and begin the arduous, treacherous journey. After successfully navigating all the way to the final town on the map just before our destination, we're ambushed, the driver dies instantly, and I smash my face into the dash when the truck crashes, killing me.

It literally destroys any chance of me enjoying this game knowing that, no matter what you do, everyone on DayZ is evil. After playing for so long, being at 12,000 blood, to die in a split second, it will never seem worth it. I thoroughly enjoy this game, but why can't anyone work for their own things? There are plenty of vehicles on the map. We spent hours fixing up our old truck. Whoever that was in Krasnostav today, on server US 1832, I will never stop playing until you are dead. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **TL;DR:** My new employers are Christians running a business completely unaffiliated with religion. Asked me religious questions in interview. Don't necessarily share beliefs. Can they legally do anything about it?


I live in Kansas if that matters (law-wise). I was recently hired to work at a business that sells car tires. It's not a church, it's not spreading the word of God, but they're obviously Christian owned (paper on the door asks people to not swear, then follows with Bible verses).

Anyway, when I was in my pretty laid-back you-already-got-the-job kind of interview for this particular business, I was asked if I was sleeping with my girlfriend or had any illegitimate children running around. As a redditor, I don't know what a girl is, so I said no. He then follows by saying, "You don't have to be a Christian to work at HerpDerp Tires Co., but we do have prayer time in our meetings. You can participate if you want." I'm like, okay, fine, that's your thing. I'm just worried they might find some reason to fire me if I disagree religiously.

Also, while I do believe in God and was raised Southern Baptist Christian, I can guarantee I don't share my beliefs with these people. I need a job though or I can't afford my rent, and this was a great opportunity. Am I safe, or is there some legal reason that they might be able to fire me in the future? </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's also true. I didn't really define either. Assuming all was completely annihilated somehow but everyone didn't die in the process, then we would be stuck at square one. However, if everything is just wrecked from bombs or some other WW3 type destruction, then we would have the rubble to use to rebuild. We would have to separate each element in the rubble, which would also take technology though. </TEXT>

If you said, "Hey, I wasn't sure if you got my message, but etc," it won't sound as good (funny) as if you said something like, "Hey [girlname], I was busy stalking your page the other day after we met and realized I really wanted to get to know you past what Facebook shows." Throw a smiley in or something. This worked for me, but my girlfriend has a stellar sense of humor, so as long as the girl you're going after would find that funny, go for it.

<TEXT> If you can be funny about it, there isn't a limit, but she may just be busy. Facebook makes stalking easy, since it now shows you if the other person has seen your message. Don't think she is ignoring you, be confident she just didn't get time to reply if anything. I think 48 hours is generally a good rule of thumb.

Onto the girl, she likes you already. I have no idea what she is like, but you could try something forwardly cute. It's easy to message people on Facebook, so ask her to a movie. She'll likely be confused, so you then say that you'll both rent the same movie and start it at the same time, and you two will talk on the phone while it's going. **Ask her for her number then** and you can have a sweet, long distance date that way. You have her number, she'll hopefully like the gesture, and you can go from there.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Hey r/cars. I need advice about buying the right car, and the internet outside of reddit cannot be trusted. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-07-02 17:16:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **My short background:** I don't know much about cars. I've driven my mother's hand-me-down Mazda MPV since I could drive at 15 (I'm 20). My favorite car used to be the RX-8 but a friend of mine got one and he was kind enough to update the world with every problem he ever had with the car, which was just about daily. Even driving the way I do, easy on the car, that car seems too much of a hassle.

**Current situation:** I'm looking to buy a car in the near future, as the radiator in my van has a life-ending crack in it and is out of commission. We could easily replace that, but it doesn't seem worth it. So my plan is to purchase a new car. I just need to make the decision on appearance or fuel economy.

I am a fan of the newer Camaros, but I'm on the fence about getting one or some really great Hybrid car. I've heard hybrids aren't worth it for numerous reasons, but I want Reddit's opinion. I wouldn't be driving the Camaro like a racecar, I just love the appearance of it. I feel like it would be a better decision to get a car with great MPG. If the hybrids aren't worth it because of their downsides I'll probably stick to the Camaro. If I'm getting a car for MPG then the appearance isn't that big of a deal. Advice?

**TL;DR** Need a new car, are hybrids actually as good as they're hyped to be, or should I stick with something I like to look at, like a Camaro? </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is a martial arts movie I'm trying to find the name of. A friend of mine is trying to find it again but she can only remember some of it. Apparently every scene has a color scheme, where all the fighters wear the same colors as the background. She says it's extremely vivid and colorful. Like the background will literally be made up of a sea of yellow flowers while the martial artists will be wearing all yellow robes. I know that's not much to go off of, but she said most of the scenes in the movie are like that, which should pretty much give away the movie if anyone has seen it. I have no idea how old the movie is. If anyone can help me figure this out I will forever be grateful. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're actually quite wrong. I was a server, and my wage was $2.15 an hour, but if I didn't make at least minimum wage they *did not* make up the difference.

And if you think washing dishes or cooking food is more difficult than being a server you are dead wrong. Serving is one of the hardest jobs. You can't really know how truly awful it is until you've been a server. I would work 12 hour days without enough time for a break or lunch, constantly on my feet moving throughout the restaurant serving six or more tables at any given time. When it gets that busy, people get irate because they don't get served in time. The servers' job is not only to carry plates. You have to keep a lot of people happy, keep their drinks filled, check to make sure they have everything they need at basically any given moment during their meal.

You're absolutely insane if you think servers get paid too much. Please, *try* to be a server for a month and you'll completely change your mind. </TEXT>

*Coat* the bread rolls in herbs, don't just dip one side in, they're so much better that way.

Proof to about 13", they shrink when they bake.

Always wipe excess cheese off the baking forms, it'll save *literally* hours of cleaning later

Last, bake them so that they're light brown, still visibly green from the herbs, and the cheese isn't burnt. You all suck at this part a lot and the bread tastes awful because of it.

In regards to the post, I think the beacon would be overpowered if everyone could spawn on it. Imagine if all 12 soldiers or even 32 spawned on it at once. It would be extreme mayhem. The idea would be cool, helpful, and useful, but way too powerful. They would have to put a security measure on it, like a half second or full second spawn delay between each spawn if they made this possible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would like to hear any of your more unusual moments where your first reaction drenched you in the fear that you would soon meet your demise, but your valorous Battlefieldian mindset brought you through to victory. Here's mine:

Today I was capturing point Bravo on Caspian Border, when a large tree on the C side of the capture point was knocked down somehow. The tree pinned my soldier so I could run around between the branches, but I was trapped within them until it disappeared. In all of my long hours since the game released in October, this has never happened to me. Meanwhile, through the brush, I witnessed a jeep with two men drive up, and a third soft target following close behind. I quickly threw on my big boy pants, locked and loaded, and screamed my war cry as I fired on the jeep's driver first, killing him, then his gunner, with a few (probably lucky) shots. The third man discovered my hideout but I used my prison to my advantage, using the branches as a shield, successfully luring him one way so that I could shoot him in the back and rain victorious, just prior to the tree vanishing. I successfully held Bravo while hiding in what I had assumed would be my grave, and now I want to hear your stories. Anything is fine, but preferably the strange. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can watch the graph update every second. Does it calculate it in reference to the prior speed? Or through some other equation? If what you're saying is true then the graph it supplies me while it's downloading the torrent is a farse, and it's not showing me real speed data.

The way I'm making sense of what you're saying, is that when the transmissions are interrupted, the speeds decelerate, which is why they fall, until they can connect to another peer, where they begin to lift again? Let me know if this is a completely false assumption. </TEXT>

Why does the download speed fluctuate in the pattern it does? I don't know much about the way internet magic works, but you can explain it in full science if it is easiest for you and I'll google the words I don't understand.

Edit: To be clear, that last line was a joke. I'm sure I'll understand however you explain it. Thanks for the replies so far!

Final Edit: Among the other good replies, 3brushie answered my question completely. I'd link to his comment, but not only do I not know how to do it the Reddit way, but it's also only about 10 inches down the page. Thanks askscience, I hope we can do this again sometime. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I realize I'm probably pretty terrible at this game, but its very tough for me not to die as a wizard on act 3 in *normal* difficulty. I use ice armor, crystal skin, wave of force, spectral blade, and arcane orb.


First off, I don't like the idea of elective mode. I think you should play the game as it was originally intended to be played. Am I just going to have to get over that?


Second, any strategies for me as a noob for surviving? The spear throwers, demons who stick they're arms in the ground, and fireball spitting bat things kill me pretty fast, because I can't move away fast enough to not get hit. Any advice would be awesome!


Btw, I believe I'm level 24, (away from my pc right now) and I don't play often because I'm more of a console gamer. Help me get back into diablo!


Edit: Thanks so far for all the helpful tips. It looks like I need to go ahead and buy auction house items (something I was against) and use elective mode (something else I was against). Ill give these a try </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks everyone for the replies, especially fuzzybootz. I figured Diablo wouldn't have VOIP, but it sounds like his computer will be fine. He bought it about a month ago, but it's a low level g7. It has a quad core processor at 1.5 GHz, and his graphics card is an AMD Radeon HD 6520g. My small amount of knowledge tells me he will be fine, but I've never actually ran a weak computer, as I've only owned the one I built specifically for being awesome.

Another question if you don't mind:

* On classes... I don't want to match my friends, and one is sure he will be a wizard. I like the monk if I can't play Wizard, but he looks like he can be boring. What do you guys *think* I should play as, since I know no one has played these specific classes yet?

(More background, I play a mace and shield wielding Nord and a dual-wielding Argonian assassin on my PS3, and I played a High Elf mage on PC and a healer for a month on WoW. So I pretty much like any class so far.) </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey everyone, I'm new to r/Diablo, Diablo in general, and really Reddit in general, and I was hoping you of the community could give me some pointers. I would have been eight when Diablo 2 came out, so my parents never let me play it. Now that I can make my own adult choices, I'm picking up Diablo 3.

My questions:

* What quick info should I know about the lore of Diablo?

* What voice communication system do we use?

I like Skype, but I'd prefer an in game system if there is one, so my friend's internet/processor aren't affected.

* Does Diablo demand much on lowest settings?

My computer will run Crysis on max, so I'm not worried, but my buddy's laptop isn't very powerful. I just want to make sure if he has to use Skype, his processor won't be too bogged down even with Diablo at it's least. He is also afraid it won't run it. Our fingers are crossed.

* Will this game be worth it for me?

I know you are all Diablo fanatics, being that you're here, but I hate wasting money, having so little of it and all. I play Battlefield 3 religiously, Skyrim just slightly less, and I own every Pokemon game (that's just to brag, not to show my gaming style). Played WoW for a free month, liked it, but couldn't afford the subscription.

Thanks in advance for any good replies. I want to be ready in exactly 12 hours. haha

Edit: Formatting! Thanks fuzzybootz! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Part of Jesus's message was revoking the false-preaching made by the Pharisees at that time. Man had created a right-and-wrong separate from what God initially told them. The religious leaders at the time (not much unlike Catholic priests today) were far from what God was about, and Jesus came to abolish that false-Church. When the description refers to "the differences between Jesus and false religion," it isn't saying Christianity (the Jesus part) is better than other religions, it is referring to Jesus calling out, so to speak, the Pharisees on their falsehoods. They put themselves in places of "God-appointed" power, which was false. 

The definition of religion is what is becoming confused here. And when he says he loves the church, he is saying he loves the idea of what church is supposed to stand for, like unity through faith, or allowing anyone in (Jesus was around the "bad" people more than the "good"). Church in our time has again fallen into a man-made invention, interpreting the Bible in such a way that says we should be against gay rights, etc. Christianity is the following of Christ, but the Christianity he is calling religion is the term man gave to the religion they follow, which has fallen away from the path that leads towards Jesus.

tl;dr - Definitions are getting mixed up, and mixed together. Be careful of that.

IAmA Christian Scientist, but I'm no theologian. This is how I interpreted the video myself. I'm not claiming that I'm right, since I'm obviously quoting the Bible, a book most of you believe is nonsense. This is the logic that makes sense to me. If I said something that doesn't make sense please pick it apart. I'm new to reddit and I'm trying to find welcome here in /r/atheism even with the beliefs I hold. </TEXT>
