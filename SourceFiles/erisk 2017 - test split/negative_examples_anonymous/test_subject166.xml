<TEXT> I just watched an expert on C-Span who wrote a book on The Bill of Rights.  She went back to the discussions at the time and said it was ALL about well-regulated militias and not at all about personal rights.  The militias were run by states and were designed to keep the states free of the potential tyrannical control of a central government.  http://www.c-span.org/person/?carolberkin </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, but I had a friend who was asked to drive while the cab driver was making out with her friend.  They were going to a restaurant in the Bay Area and were afraid they could nor get a cab back, so invited the driver to dine with them.  He hit it off with her friend and was asked to drive while they got in the back of the cab. If you knew my friend, you would be laughing on the floor to hear the story. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Democrat or Republican?  I think there is room at the local level, or more opportunities if you want to travel.  I would make myself known at offices of elected officials and the party you are associated with.  You could get hired as a representative or hear about a 501(C)(4) position associated with policy.  Find a new candidate, do some fundraising to pay for your salary, get your candidate elected, then start your own consulting firm.  You could start out as a political writer like Jon Ralston.  You can get government jobs.  If you are a Democrat, check out Organized Karma.   If it doesn't look like there is potential in the long-term, go to law school.  I had a poli sci degree and worked mostly in nonprofits, but there were other options had I pursued them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I worked as a job counselor for 8 summers for a federally-subsidized Summer Youth Program where about 1,000 kids worked for nonprofits, schools, etc. for 8 weeks during the summer.  Some even worked as firefighters.  This program operated for years and Congress kept reducing it to almost nothing,  It gave young people the opportunity to see how the working world works, and many of those kids went on to become successful, productive citizens.  I think it was worth it.  They also had a short-term program for adults - and when the economy was down, more money was allocated.  You may not like it, but it keeps people in the job market, the money gets spent in the community and we all do better.  I hate this trajectory we are on.  All the money now goes to the rich in terms of tax cuts.  And contrary to what many believe, they are not necessarily the job-creators.  We subsidize the rich with their low-paying salaries through tax benefits, and in making up the difference in low-wages with welfare, food stamps and medical. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I voted yes on all three.  The legislature is unable to pass a tax to help schools.  They had time through many sessions to come up with other options.  When they don't do anything,  we have to wait another two years until they meet again.  In the meantime, nothing is done.  We have to do what they are incapable of doing.   25% of the children in the schools live in poverty.  I do not have children, but believe that all children need a good education.  Teachers also have a great investment in their education and need to be paid a decent wage also.  I believe they cannot recruit enough teachers because the starting salary is so low.  This is crazy.

Mining has not been taxed since the State created its constitution. They had lobbyists even then and wrote it into the state constitution that they be exempt from taxes.  They have had their free ride and now need to contribute to the state's wellbeing also.  

I voted for the Court of Appeals, but do not have a passion for the issue.  I just can imagine that the other courts are backed up too.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of my favorite life stories:  We had a welfare rights march in our town in the 70's.  There was another group who organized an anti-welfare march.  A year or so later I was at our local legal services office as a volunteer and I recognized the leader of the anti-welfare march at the office.  He had experienced a heart attack, lost his job, then his wife and his home.  He had no health care, and was seeking legal services.  His life had literally fallen apart.  I remember speaking with him and he regretted the role he had played when fighting these "welfare mothers". </TEXT>

<TEXT> A couple of points:  I do not believe it is a ponzi scheme; Ponzi schemes run out of investors eventually.  Social security will not; benefits would be reduced first.  It is NECESSARY unless you want to support your parents late in life when they are not able to work.  Finally, I wished I had taken a video of my republican congressman also who also called it a Ponzi scheme at a town meeting.  Republicans don't really want to get rid of social security - they just want to get their greedy hands on it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recently went to a conference with a friend (out of LV).  She lost her wallet TWICE before we landed at our destination.  They paged her the first time and she got it back.  We boarded and she left her wallet again(!) on the plane.  This time it when on to another destination! The airlines mailed it to her at our hotel so she did get it back before we left town, but most of the money was gone.  She did her ID back though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I appreciate the chart.  I am old and still want some type of entrepreneurship project.  I still am working 40 hrs/week, but want to give it one last go.  Just haven't found the project I want to throw myself in to. (I did help create a few great nonprofits when I was younger though).  Also, I want a partner to review things with, share responsibility.  I've been looking for a good partner to conspire with, and everyone seems to be too busy doing their own thing.  I'm not giving up however! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Teachers are unionized, and probably one of the largest unions in the US.   Unions are probably one of the biggest contributors to democrats also.  Kill the unions, kill the Democratic Party.  It's political. Too add to this, teachers are highly educated and for many years were underpaid.  They learned that they could lift their standard of living by working together, unionizing.  And they have done better that they did before they were unionized. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm assuming when the term welfare is used in this discussion, that it includes welfare and food stamps.  Remember that welfare is time limited - maximium 5 years in the US from the welfare reform law passed  during the Clinton administration.  Most welfare recipients are young single mothers, and if not working, are required to attend vocational training or volunteer 20-30 hrs/week.  2-parent households are required to meet a 35 hr/week requirement.  Those unable to work must have a doctor's statements. </TEXT>

It is an interesting story too that I only learned about after reading about it online at UW.  The varsity team couldn't go to the Olympics (i don't remember why), and the JV team took their place.  They were not expected to do well, but won the Gold.  My cousins took me to a bar at Northgate shopping center last year to show me a full wall mural of the team! </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, it is not a ponzi scheme.  Ponzi scheme runs out when there are no more investors.  As long as people continue to pay in to the system, there can always be social security.  Also, they can raise the rates or cut benefits a small amount, but people will continue to be paid.  Also, think about supporting your parents when they are old and unable to work.  Isn't it better that they can remain self-sufficient in their old age?  And how will you feel at that age?   Ready to work until you drop? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would love to see a reddit map of precincts, and recruit reddit captains for each precinct.  That might be a project worth working on!  Move-on had a great project one year (not sure why they didn't continue it), but I was able to download every voter in my precinct and contact them either by phone or in person.  I am biased and support democrats (at least good ones).  It would be cool to target democrats in republican districts and see if is possible to flip the district.   Also, I noted on a previous comment that I would target medicaid-eligible people also who are unable to sign up for medicaid as their state did not accept medicaid expansion (21 states?).  These people could seriously benefit from voting in their self-interest. </TEXT>

I can't address your questions, but I heard a recorded phone call on an old tv show (Investigative Reports I believe) that wowed me - where one mob person told another that the hit was on for JFK.  I was also convinced by Thom Hartmann's book - http://www.amazon.com/Legacy-Secrecy-Long-Shadow-Assassination/dp/1582435359
By the way, I think I found the Investigative Report show also that covered it:  http://www.amazon.com/Investigative-Reports-Jack-Anderson-JFK/dp/B000FKP0TG

I know that you know that democrats became republicans after Jim Crow - part of the well-known southern strategy.  And I personally believe that voter ID laws are an attempt to restrict minority voting.  And there are a lot of people who believe this or the republican party would not be 90% white, or that Romney would get more than 4% of the minority vote.  
The whole concept of limited government is bizarre to me.  It is my belief that the Articles of Confederation failed because they didn't give the federal government enough power to function.  We also fought a civil war over states rights, and the South lost!  Can't we just let the issue die and get on with it??!!!  Sorry about the 18 day response - I don't check this area of reddit frequently enough...I do appreciate your response though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Several things:  To lose weight, I have to cut way back and exercise.  I lose weight and need to cut my calories again to lose more weight.  I don't think I can cut them any farther!  I also have a history of yo-yo dieting.  I always end up weighing more than before I started!  I think if I would have worked out more when I was young and never dieted, I wouldn't weigh what I do today.  I don't know if that makes sense, but that is how I feel.  It is also a lot of work and takes more time than I want to spend on the topic.  I do know I would feel better though. </TEXT>

No, they are moving their corporate headquarters to counties like Switzerland to specifically avoid American taxes.  They probably have a better standard of living there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why do fiscal conservatives vote republican anyway?  They say they are fiscally sound, but if you look at it historically, they are not.  They spend it different ways - mostly for military, and usually end up with a lot of ripoffs due to deregulation.  Reagan is a prime example. Cut taxes, expand the military, deregulate (which killed Savings and Loans and created a huge ripoff of HUD which cost billions.))  Democrats at least have a plan for pay for what they spend and try to monitor spending.  They also realize that peoples rising boat lifts the whole society. </TEXT>

But he was just a fast-talker - just like you are writing about.  I knew his wife.  Not sure if he is around today.  I think the only license you would need is a straight business license (but I'm not an expert).  UNLV offered a class one semester on handicapping and I made my husband go - it caused a stir (not sure I remember why), and they never offered the class again.  That being said, there is probably room for a smart handicapper.  The ones that publish in the paper have always sucked.  The really good handicappers work for the sportsbooks setting odds in the first place. </TEXT>

They systematically worked (and there could be multiple ways to do this) to increase the costs of studies to restrict enrollment in schools and  to keep students and graduates so indebted that they would stop liberal arts studies and wouldn't have time to protest social injustices anymore.  They also worked to stop professors from getting tenure (where they could say what they believed without threat of losing their jobs) to adjunct professors who could not even support themselves any longer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is a company that is hiring 500 people by Friday.  You need to apply online, then go prior to Friday for interview.  I have their location at my office but it is on the 6000 block of Las Vegas Blvd. So. Maybe you could call and get their address.  They are interviewing and hiring on the spot.  40 hrs x 12/hr.  At least it is getting back into the work force.  http://www.c3connect.com/ </TEXT>

You usually have to start as a bar back.  There is a bartender's union also.  Not sure if they are accepting new members, but it might be worth a call to check them out or to see what they recommend.  This is not a job, but the best I can think of right now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually, I think that "Dog Whistle Politics" stated that 96% of Romney's vote came from the white population.  In terms of membership, Yahoo says whites make up 90% of all Republicans.  
http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080619075211AAEZsTi
"Dog Whistle Politics" did say that Romney won the white vote of every age group which surprised me.  I thought youth had become more liberal.

"Dog Whistle.." also reported that the Democrats have not won the white vote for President since 1964 since LBJ was elected.  You may know that when he signed the Civil Rights Act, he predicted that he may have lost the south for the Dems for a generation.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson

This caused Republicans to develop the Southern Strategy under Nixon. Two Republicans former chairs have apologized for that strategy:

Ken Melman, former chair apologizing for the party using the race card: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/13/AR2005071302342.html

Michael Steel, former GOP chair apologizing for the party's use of the Southern Strategy:
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/22/michael-steele-for-decade_n_547702.html

You know, I'm white and don't like to hear this either, but sometimes the truth is painful.  I really recommend this book. C-Span had an interview with the book's author.  You can watch an interview at: http://booktv.org/search.aspx?For=dog%20whistle%20politics

I calling someone a liar is not the best way to disagree.

<TEXT> He's right.  The Republican Party is 96% white, and the white population is diminishing as a proportion of the population.  Two former Chairs of the Republican Party have apologized for the party using the race card.  The party is fundamentally flawed.  I just finished reading "Dog Whistle Politics" and recommmend it for people who want to understand it.  Rand Paul is not a libertarian either.  He has some issues that he sounds great on, but then there are other issues.... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Interesting concept.  I used to think they had not been in control of  congress for so long, they didn't know how to govern. When they did control Congress, they did a terrible job on it. I still believe that they don't know how to govern, but how we got there may be different than what I thought.  We do have a problem with the constitution and giving them more representation than they deserve.  I'm not sure we will ever get them out. </TEXT>

I started walking - a little more each day - and did leg presses at the gym to get my strength up.  It took a while, but easily got up to 3 miles/day x 6 days/week - 20 minute mile - about 1 hr/day.  I only lost 30 lbs, but my pant size went from a 20 to a 12.  I stopped and it all came back very quickly.  I'm having trouble getting motivated again, but I know it works.  My doctor was really pleased with my vitals. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Las Vegas willl be a part of nationwide strike tomorrow demanding better pay for low-wage workers. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-08-29 05:48:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Join thousands of fast food workers as part of a nation wide strike to demand better pay and better treatment. Low-wage workers are having a hard time making ends meet while corporations such as McDonalds, Wendys, Burger King and KFC are making billions in profits. Theyre paying poverty wages and keeping the entire economy down.

 There will be strikes in the northwest and downtown Las Vegas from 6 to 11 a.m. on Thursday, August 29th. We will be dividing into two shifts, as we understand most people cannot attend the full day. 

 WHAT: 1st shift
 WHERE: PLAN  Las Vegas, 708 S. 6th Street, Las Vegas, NV 89101
 WHEN: 5 AM

 WHAT: 2nd shift
 WHERE: PLAN  Las Vegas, 708 S. 6th Street, Las Vegas, NV 89101
 WHEN: 9 AM

 For more information on the strikes contact:

<TEXT> Years ago, we had an anti-welfare march in our town with people who think just like you. I was volunteering at our local legal aid office. One of the leaders of this anti-welfare march was there seeking assistance. He had had a heart attack (no insurance), lost his job, then his wife. He was trying to get some help. He regretted his previous stance. The lesson is that we are all one step away from poverty.  I now work at a welfare office.  When jobs were available, we had a lot less clients. People on the whole prefer to work. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He is absolutely correct.  The amount of Social Security one receives is also based on your top 30 yrs of earnings - and you need to earn $20,000/year substanial earnings for the year to count more than $0.  I see too many jobs paying minimum wage to $12/hr which will never help to contribute enough earnings for social security.  And comments here are right too, we can never get enough people out to protest.  We have to find a way to get the do-nothings out of congress and keep the good ones. I'm so frustrated too for people - yet alone myself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I put $3000 in a 401K in 1990.  It is still worth $3000 today.  For those of you who who don't believe the article, I urge to to check out the Frontline video on PBS.  Nebraska conducted a 20 yr study and came out with the same conclusion.  People will not be able to retire on a 401(k). And Social Security is not a ponzi scheme because we should not run out of workers investing the system.  A ponzi scheme runs out of investors.  I do worry about there being a lack of work permanently as a way to distribute money throughout the society.  If we do not have work, we will all lose and the whole economy will fail, not just social security.  I've spent a lot of years looking at this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Years ago, we had a welfare march in my town to protest some of the policy decisions from our state that cut many people off the rolls.  There was also an anti-welfare march to support those policy decisions.  I later met the leader of the anti-welfare march.  He had had a heart attack, his wife left him, and he lost his house.  He was trying to get legal assistance when I met him.  It could happen to any of us.  Oh, and by the way, I just wish I would hear as much complaining about corporate welfare which probably surpasses all of the welfare programs - and generally ends up in just a few pockets. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of course, I know what percent of taxes people pay.  Did you know that the top rate use to be 90%?  Money has been devalued on purpose!  I saw the head of the manufacturer's lobby on c-span during the Bush administration saying that was their goal.  They want goods to be cheap enough for Americans to afford them.  They also want to pay less for wages.  The bottom 45% pay a higher percentage of their wages in payroll taxes.  I think the low-income tax credit was a subsidy to businesses to be able to pay low wages to workers and still make huge profits.  I think in a sense that is what the Obamacare is also - a subsidy to companies like Wal-Mart who do not want to pay for health care for thier workers.  So we were all paying for it anyway, at hospital emergency rooms.  I worked at Welfare and saw the flyers Wal-Mart was giving to thier employees to go apply for medicaid.  What is right about that?  There is another submission I saw on Reddit today that says poor people get the same amount of GDP as do the rich in terms of tax benefits.  Found it:  http://www.reddit.com/tb/15di1o
 And contrary to some people's believes, the rich are not job creators.  It is only a race to the bottom.  We do better as individuals and as a country when we are all doing well, not just a few. </TEXT>

Social security isn't even a part of the budget.  Boomers paid 110% more than they should have to cover the costs of social security.  Americans LOVE those programs and will pay for them.

<TEXT> You needed the spending to avoid a huge depression.  They used to call government spending "priming the pump", when private enterprise is not spending, government needs to spend.   It didn't cost much in interest rates.  Republicans screamed about the deficit during Clinton years - and poof - it was gone in no time when everyone went to work.  It is higher now, and it will stay high through the boomer's retirement, but it is not so excessive as to break the county.  Wiki "the two-santa theory".  Large Federal spending has been historically higher under republicans.  They don't mind big-government, they just mind big-government money being spent on regular people.  They love the military and contracting with private enterprise.  We can go off the cliff, then the republicans can vote for a tax-break for 90% of the people, just not the rich. </TEXT>

She may be able to chek out if they ever hire on HIB visas, or whatever. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is totally corporate-controlled by state statute.  A co-worker had it installed on his home at an upfront cost of $50,000 (probably close to the value of my house).  He got a $15,000 rebate from NV Energy which was the exact charge of installation (and he turned it over to the installers).  I found a group online in suburban Washington D.C. was able to start a co-op with an average cost of $1,500 per house.  You can't do that here without a change in legislation.  I would be up to working on this with people who want the law changed, and have just recently started to talk with people about it.  By the way, my co-worker pays $8/mo now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was young, we used to take the turn at Glendale going north (off the highway heading to the Valley of Fire and Moapa), and would go to Warm Springs.  In those days, they had three swimming pools open to the public.  I haven't been there in almost 30 years now, and the last time I saw it, one was privately owned, and the other two pools were empty.  I'm not sure what it is like today, but it looks like it is a wildlife area now.

Second, I went to a meeting at the Health Department to promote my grant for a community health center.  The room was packed.  I thought the people there were to comment on my half million dollar grant.  No, they were there to speak against a $10,000 family planning grant.   I was stunned.  I also thought Watergate would end it because it seemed so bipartisan, but it didn't, only made it worse. </TEXT>

Lots of grant writers don't.   Look at the RFP (request for proposals).  If you know interest groups involved in the projects, ask them if they have any sample proposals to use as guidelines.   Funders generally tell you what they are looking for - and what information they want from you.  I used to joke that it was a term paper with a budget.

<TEXT> I met a photographer from NG.  He had written at least one book about his career there, which I gave as a gift, so unfortunately, I can't remember his name!  He started out there as an intern and was eventually hired by them. It's been a few years now, but he had worked for them for over 25 yrs.  I think he also had 2-3 covers on the mag.  Sorry, this is the best I can offer! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love Bill Clinton but he did a lot wrong because he caved to republicans on important values.  We got the terrible trade bills like NAFTA that offered no worker protection, he signed the bill to get rid of Glass Steagal which paved the way for the crash.  And remember how they harrassed him to death with the special prosecutor, finally impeaching him.  Now, they act like he was a saint. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are structural problems in the Senate.  You need 60 votes to get anything through.  With  Ted Kennedy being  sick and then dying, the Senate didln't have 60 votes.  Pelosi passed a ton of bills in the House that couldn't pass in the Senate.  Dems are not like Republicans.  It's hard to get 60 Dems in the Senate to agree on anything.  I do think Campaign Finance reform would help.  Both parties are too tied to fundraising, lobbiests. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He's not on the ballot for another 4 years (Senators have 6-yr terms, not 2-years as in the House).  The Senate has some flaws that make it impossible to govern without a 60 vote majority.  Getting rid of incumbents won't help.  They have learned that term limits only turn government over to lobbiests and bearucrats because they are then the only people who understand the system.  This is not what you want.  You may want to work to change the rules.  I saw an article once (wish I could find it) that it is also possible for the House to be highjacked by a small minority (like the tea party) so the House is unable to get anything done either.  Ideally, you want majorities of the same party in both houses to be able to get things done.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Romney didn't run for a second term because he had a 31% favorability rating.  Additionally, he vetoed 800 bills passed by the Massachusetts legislature.  I didn't link the stats, but you can find them fairly easily by googling them.  So much for bipartisanship.  We have to end this plutocracy.  Our only hope we change the constitution or find a way out of this pay for play system, and save the middle class.  Otherwise, we will all lose. </TEXT>
