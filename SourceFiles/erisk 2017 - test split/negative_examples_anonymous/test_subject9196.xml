<TEXT> We had an Android Wear watchface for few months, but it was using old (now deprecated) API and we took it off store.
Currently we are working on:
Hardware clock, updated Android app with many neat (I hope so) features, and then Wear watchface.

Sorry to put this on the end but we are rewriting whole app to make rending clock faster and more flexible to many situations, and then we can work on watchface with awesome performance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry if it sounded off putting.
My previous posts was mostly - tinkering is awesome and I really recommend it (even if you "end up buying mine") as you will have tons of fun, and maybe we have missed some important thing.
Also I already developed (for now a beta part) an API for 12hours to allow 3rd party devs to play with this, as I can find one, two... uses for this but I'm sure there are tons more. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Once I find a bit of free time I will make a (probably) medium short story how it went from idea (3 years ago) to current state (and hopefully to product on the market).

Let's just say it was a lot of tinkering, seeing what works, what doesn't, what we should improve, what are key aspects, polishing design, polishing design etc.

And don't get me wrong, attaching LEDs to a clock was easy but for example figuring out that it is good to move from wall clock to desk one is a better idea was tricky part. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know what kind of app are you making, but I would recommend going through Google flags apps like Gmail, Newsstand, Play Store itself and check things like button presses. They do not have touch. Even Google Maps sound is limited to voice commends which is key-feature.

One app that I'm aware that stands out is Facebook - sound on refresh, but they are big enough to push their own ideas across platforms.

I'm not sure how it looks currently but at some point also Twitter from what I recall had some sounds on refresh list. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not a source but considering your example (button clicks) -  don't do this. For one simple reason - many users have build in system sound for click on touch screen (ex. LG by default), which will be supper annoying.

Or just offer simple way to turn it off.

Also it is not common to implement sounds in apps (if we consider UI - as refreshes, buttons etc.) probably in most cases only notifications are "loud". Of course this doesn't apply to for example music apps for obvious reasons. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi,
I installed Duolingo on my grandma tablet and she started learning at amazing peace and eager. Started with 0 language knowledge around a month ago.
Her native language is Polish and Duolingo offering Polish-English course was a big plus.
My guess was to start with movies in English with Polish subtitles as probably her reading skills are better than listening. Other idea is to convince her to go for special course. What are your recommendations for older people? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know where you live but in my area apart from Hackathons (which probably aren't best fit for you as you are looking for a not that rapid developing) there are dozens of meeting to solve some problems in society - for example http://kodujdlapolski.pl/ which means "code for Poland" and in most of their meetings there are at least few ideas and always too little dev people.

Another idea is to take some popular Android app that is abandoned for a while (bad UI, slow etc.) and make it much better - just be aware of trade marks etc.

Also probably /r/Android or /r/enterpreneur is better to give you just an idea for an app. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I use Win 8.1 (came with win 7 - uh). 
HDPI is fine, now using FullHD on 24" is a pain ( a bit joking but hell, you get addicted to hdpi).
There is no many issues with hdpi - mainly scaling in not round way ( 100% is supper small, 150% is fine, but 123% for example is blurry in many place), some installers are a bit blurry but I hope with Win 10 it will be a bit better (also steam application is not hdpi-friendly). Probably HD on 14" is just enough but QHD is only version that was available here in Poland with i7. </TEXT>

Screen could be more bright, touchpad one or two times (since 2 months) had some problems - trackpoint not, restart helped.
Overally happy but 8GB is a bit of pain, 12GB would be perfect. Would buy it second time - also LTE is super nice (even if before buying it wasn't key feature) having 1GB per month for 15$ a year is super nice fallback. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, shop looks decent, if you are not sure what kind of stuff they are going to buy just make sure to order a "KARTA MAXI" card as using that they can choose from any store listed on their site. So they can use it in bookstore or any other kind of store.

I don't know where do you live but 200PLN is a decent amount for present and for sure they will be happy with it. Just to put amount of money in perspective in McDonald's cheeseburger is 5PLN if I'm correct, average lunch in Warsaw (capital, so it can be lower in other cities) is ~20-25PLN. However electronics etc. are in the same prices as in any Western Europe country (just add 15-20% to USA prices as we got way bigger tax). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, we can order from Amazon.co.uk but for some products there is no shipping to Poland. However most products are ok.

Also you can search for "karty podarunkowe" which is "gift cards" and look for some other store as well - depending on interests.
I would suggest looking for merlin.pl (mainly bookstore), empik.com (similar, probably bigger=more items), or agito.pl (as Amazon, however everything is sold by one company).

And keep in mind that if you buy for example Google Play card (awesome because we got access to movies and ebooks lately) they are sold for particular country so you have to look for "polish" one. </TEXT>

CoolMaster Quickfire Rapid - good, "standard", cheap (one of cheapest), and same manufacture as Filco.

Other than that - Leopold 660M, to Europe is one of cheapest options if you like such layout. So which keyboard is "the cheapest" depends on that where you live.

For example in Poland SteelSeries is one of cheapest (90$), and next is Razer BW Tournament (120$). In Europe you should also check Das Keyboard as it might be good option to go. </TEXT>

<TITLE> 12Hours version 2.0 - I worked hard for you guys! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-19 20:39:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Maybe some of you remember [my widget \(12Hours\)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tajchert.hours) that I posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1uvt84/made_a_clockwidget_with_events_marked_as_colored/) 4 months ago.

After a long time I have done bigger update that add thinks such:

* Languages (Polish, German, Portuguese, Chinese, Italian, Spanish, French).
*  **More than one instance of a widget** - go and put 12Hours everywhere!
*  Second custom touch action for a widget.
*  **Custom colors!**
*  New skins (and more yet to come).
*  Wizard when adding a widget
* Optimization and code cleaning so next features will take less time.

I know that there is still much to do, but would love (as last time) feedback and advice on what features I should focus on, and what you would like to change.

That is my "thank you" for you guys, as only because of you it became popular (around 130k downloads).

disclaimer I would take a look at each (even down voted ones) ideas and opinions but things will be implemented not earlier then 2-3 weeks, because I discovered (by making that widget) that it isn't good to write code in a rush./disclaimer

EDIT: I have made some **G+ group** with access to beta releases and to discuss new functionality, submit your layout to include into app etc. -[HERE](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/108716578003125422667) </TEXT>

But don't rely on nursing job in Poland - English teacher would be a better choice, and if possible try to merge those two - look at Medicover/Lux Med (private clinics) as they possibly are looking for such people (or maybe translating medical literature to Polish, or teaching medical students).

Good luck! </TEXT>

Just use ongoing notification for such actions. I think it is a wise move as my 95% of use of sw2 is only notifications.

<TEXT> 1) Yes it is a problem, probably I will go with making borders around each event, and smaller event will be on top. Not ideal but almost close to it.
2)Color sync is on its way. Title/description would be hard, and I don't have ready answer to that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1 - It is not a bug, at least not of my widget (heh, probably every dev is saying that). I can't get event after it was created, otherwise I would have to check database very often = battery drain. So I use minimal widget update time = 30minutes, and after that event will show up, or you can remove and add it.
2. Will do, thx, I saw that but has forgotten.
3. Will change - in next versions there would be normal activity as there will be more options to set - customization! </TEXT>

So Razer was quite good choice considering situation. I own black widow tournament edition (love tkl), and now I'm considering buying Shine 3 TKL with browns. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Story:http://www.wykop.pl/wpis/6622222/kupie-pizze-2-za-10-000-doge-mieszkam-w-olawie-mow/

It's polish portal similar to reddit, a guy with nick "noisy" asked somebody to ordered 2 pizzas to [Oawa](https://goo.gl/maps/6JWSz) offering 10k in Dogecoins.
A guy "SharpNieSharp" took a challenge and ordered them, a special ask was to write "Dogecoin" on a box.
Pierogi (dumplings) was an extra thing - personal choice of SharpNieSharp.



Edit: If you need any translation - just ask (exam tomorrow so I will do anything apart from studying).  </TEXT>

I would say that only downside of camera is a fact that it protrudes from body, so I often put finger on it - and then lens is dirty. So remember to swipe with t-shirt it before taking an awesome photo :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you know any wireless charger (iQ, would be used with Nexus 5) with an extra USB port in it?
So besides the phone (wireless) I can charge a mp3, or a tablet without getting under the desk. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Germany have them - code on each kitkat (outside) - bought 6 of them, and no prize.

Poland - they are but competition page says 1 more day and 20h to start of a competition. And code is going to be on a receipt/bill (so as I understand 1 per one shopping, not per bar).

Italy and Austria - I haven't seen them, when I checked 1 week ago. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Keep up with Google guidelines - for sure app using G+ multiplayer are not worst due to matter of used service. Take a look at Osmos HD multiplayer - quite nicely done!

I don't know how it is in your country/surrounding but more and more my friends started using G+ as it is more hmmm, lets say 'professional' (less family) and it is connected to your phone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some story behind that gif:
It was during EURO 2012 in Warsaw - when hosts (Poland) was playing with England - game was postponed. But there is a roof which (even despite that forecast was saying that it is going to rain) was left open.
As a result of waiting for the game, two guys run on pitch - they were arrested, but later on (as I remember correctly) their charges were withdrawn. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got few pairs of headphones (always 'in ear' ones) which have same problem - one from pair is broken, in some of them it start working when you hold cable near jack (where cable ends, and jack starts) at special angle.
Is there any easy way to fix them? So far I was always buying a new pair (all of them last around 5-12 months), but it's enough! </TEXT>
