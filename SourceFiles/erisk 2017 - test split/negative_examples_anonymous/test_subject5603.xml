<TEXT> The Congressional Research Service found that the vast majority of unauthorized immigrants do not fit in the category that fits Trumps description: aggravated felons, whose crimes include murder, drug trafficking or illegal trafficking of firearms.

I don't disagree with the idea that we'd be better off with less illegal immigration. But it sure seems to me he's exaggerating the criminality of illegal immigrants in some rather heated language. And he's ignoring another group of criminals. The most frequent crime involving illegal aliens is employing them.  Somehow I rarely hear these secure borders advocates talk about cracking down on illegally hiring immigrants. Seems to me fewer employment opportunities for illegal immigrants would do a lot more to reduce their numbers than any wall on the border. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have two issuesv with your argument.  'Many Republicans like Rand Paul' doesn't consist of very many Republicans.  Only a [dismaying small percentage](http://www.businessinsider.com/10-percent-of-republicans-think-climate-change-is-human-caused-2015-7) of Republicans believe that climate change is caused by humans. Secondly, 'strong capitalism' isn't going to fix climate change by itself.  If you want a market based solution to climate change, you need to provide some incentives, some way to profit from addressing the problem.  There was support for that among republicans in the past (solutions like cap and trade), but it's virtually non-existent now. </TEXT>

A 2004 Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel investigation found the law would cost Wisconsin $1.8 billion dollars over 25 years and bring prison spending to par with the states university system.

<TEXT> For me , it was mostly just listening enough to get familiar with his music. Some years ago I had a long commute and and old car with a broken radio.  I had a copy of Free Jazz in the car, which I though was OK, but pretty strange. But for the entire week I kept forgetting to bring another cassette out to the car, so I probably listened to Free Jazz nine or ten times , and by the end of the week I couldn't remember why I'd thought it was weird.  

The analogy I use for Ornette Coleman (or other forms of outre music) is to compare it to painting.  If you went to a museum and were expecting to see realistic visual representation and found yourself in a roomful of say, Jackson Pollock and Paul Klee, you'd probably think.  What is this crap, these guys can't even draw.  But if you spend some time with it , you realize they've decided to take the art materials and do something completely different, something with it's own logic that is completely different from representational art.  I think Ornette Coleman more or less reinvented jazz music, the way some visual artists reinvented painting.  (Don't take this analogy too far or it starts to break down.)  </TEXT>

Walker and Republican allies in the Legislature gave themselves no cushion for error in their bet that broad tax cuts would jump-start the states economy and more than pay for themselves.  When the new projections didnt materialize, we put ourselves into a hole, Knapp said.

<TEXT> Here's an idea, let me know if it seems to match up with your experience.   For 10/11, you're probably not getting the best people in the American labor pool. But for the visa workers, 10/11 is much better than they'll earn at home.  Hard working people from Mexico want these jobs. If you were able to pay 20 an hour for laborer jobs, I would guess you'd get all the competent hard working Americans you'd need.

Or that his intention was to [divide and conquer](http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/in-film-walker-talks-of-divide-and-conquer-strategy-with-unions-8o57h6f-151049555.html)  Wisconsin's unions.

<TEXT> Walker would like us to believe that the state's dismal economic performance on his watch is everyone else's fault. He's blamed Jim Doyle, Barack Obama and Mary Burke among others 

I never understand why politicians can get away with this.  They make ludicrous promises (Walker promised his policies would create 250K jobs) and when they fail to deliver, it's everybody's fault but their own.  Arrant puerility, and it's coming from people who are leading the country. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Judging from my own experience, I'd say classical music (in the widest sense of the word) would gain a bigger audience if the performers and promoters started presenting more 20/21st century pieces.  For listeners coming from a jazz or rock background, I think Stravinsky, Glass, Shostakovich, Whitacre or (insert your favorite modern or  contemporary composer here) are much more readily accessible than music from the Classical and Romantic Eras.

<TEXT> The [most authoritative study](http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-04-17/kansas-governor-brownbacks-lab-for-steep-tax-and-budget-cuts) of the effect of these measures is a January report by the Kansas Legislative Research Department, a nonpartisan arm of the legislature. It found that revenue isnt keeping up with expenses even after cuts in spending on K-12 schools, colleges, libraries, local health departments, courts, and welfare. If nothing changed, the research departments numbers show, the states general fund would have a shortfall of about $900 million by fiscal year 2019, or 14 percent of expenses that year. The states constitution requires a balanced budget, so either taxes will have to go back up or spending will have to come down even more. **The tax cuts dont pay for themselves,** says Duane Goossen, who served as state budget director under both Republican and Democratic governors. **That just is not happening.**

But I doubt any number will rattle the true believers.  Tax cuts are always good, and any contrary evidence is denigrated or ignored. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like Sara Palin, Walker plays the politics of resentment quite well. Wisconsin's biggest economic problems center around the still shrinking manufacturing economy, but Walker's managed to convince part of the electorate that Wisconsin's problems are the over-educated liberals, overpaid civil servants and welfare recipients.  Meanwhile he's greatly reduced public services, ended many employment protections, and has ground down Wisconsin's education system, which was one the finest in the country.  He wants to makeover Wisconsin into the low wage model, typically found in the reddest states. I see the strategy he's using, but why people keep falling for it, I wish I understood.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This comment from Temuzjin summed it up pretty well

To create jobs, you generally need supply of goods and demand for goods.
A rich entrepreneur who hires people to make goods helps with the supply side. These are commonly called "job creators."
However, you could just as easily call a guy who buys a loaf of bread (or another good) a "job creator" because he or she helps with the demand side. Without demand, jobs that supply goods soon become unprofitable, which means that those jobs vanish. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Telling us they're the 'job creators' was another pretty good one. People have been falling for that one for decades.

Edit: I don't think I've ever posted anything on Reddit that recieved this many responses, 
(some of them quite good). So, while I have your attention, please let me elaborate a little:

Take your investment capital and try to run a successful job-creating business in a place that lacks.

- a government that enforces contracts

- a government that protects you against physical assault and fraud.

- Government services (Take your brilliant idea for a business and open it a place with crappy roads
and no public transportation.  Or for a real challenge, a place with no public water and sewer.)

- competent employees (who in America, have usually been educated at public expense)

- or most importantly, customers with money to spend

Sure investment capital plays a role in creating jobs and wealth.  But it's not the whole game.  The conservatives have exaggerated the role capital plays in the economy, and used it as a reason to justify low taxes or public giveaways to business, to reduce the rights and protections of employees, and policies that reduce labor's share 
of the [national income](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/why-labors-share-of-income-is-falling/l).  </TEXT>

Instead of admitting that the projection might have been off the mark or that no Governor has enough control over an economy to make such a promise, (or even, heaven forbid, admit  that his policies might not give the results he expected) he's always blaming the protesters or the media or Obama or just about anyone else.

<TEXT> Lucian Leape, an adjunct professor of health policy at Harvard Universitys T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told PolitiFact, "I think these data are reliable, and the ACA (Affordable Care Act) deserves credit." Leape, who has been studying preventable hospital deaths since the early 1990s, credited improved data collection and the work of Partnership for Patients, "which has been a serious  and successful  effort to engage hospitals in achieving specific goals, such as reducing infections." **He said its the kind of effort he and others called for a decade and a half ago but "never got before the ACA. Hospitals were improving their safety slowly on their own, and this gave it a big boost.**

But what does he know about correlation and causality? </TEXT>

<TEXT> In other words, hospital deaths in general were already on a downward slope prior to the health care laws passage; its just accelerated since then. The authors of the report that Obama cited also hedged a bit on the causes for the decline, writing that "the precise causes of the decline in patient harm are not fully understood."

Seems to me they addressed that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would say that "low cost methods of manufacturing fossil fuels from plant/animal waste" is a form of renewable energy.  Replacing coal (which is the real problem) will probably be a multi-pronged solution, a better grid, using natural gas in combination with solar and wind, or maybe a solution we can hardly imagine or think possible.  I don't think the Wright Brothers thought their invention and those barely functional automobiles would replace the train as the main methods of transportation in America within a few generations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not long ago cellphones were unaffordable for most people, and a computer was something at a university or business that you waited for a turn to use. The communications and computer power we all have now were almost unimaginable just a few decades ago, and at a far lower price that very few anticipated.  I would argue we could effect the same change in energy.  A couple of decades of research and spending could change energy production and distribution completely, the same way communications and computing power have changed. Sticking with the fossil fuels is looking backward, like insisting that an IBM 360 mainframe and a AT T landline will serve all our future needs.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem isn't going to fixed by taxing the wealthy, it's going to fixed by changing the economic system. Between [1979-2007 period, after-tax income of households in the top 1 percent of earners grew by 275%, compared to 65% for the next 19 percent, just under 40% for the next 60 percent, 18% for the bottom fifth of households.] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States#Post-1970_increase)

<TEXT> Yes, it is a bit hyperbolic, and I believe I first read the remark about studies about health, which are particularly polluted with sponsored 'studies'.  But it is also true that industry looks for scientists who are already inclined toward the viewpoint they want. (I'm not saying the scientists themselves are dishonest. I assume they legitimately believe their arguements.) You notice these industries didn't pick a random professor of atmospheric science to study the problem, they funded the one who was likely to say what they wanted to hear. Sponsoring studies with an outcome in mind that would be to your own financial and political advantage far more 'negligent to science' than some skepticism about a study and its funding sources.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No not really.  Studies sponsored by an industry tend to support what the industry wants.  They look to hire researchers that are favorable to their industry, and if the results aren't too their liking, they're not required to publish them. 
Obviously, there are studies from independent sources that aren't biased, but generally they aren't sponsored by anyone with an agenda.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't have an on-line source for this, but in The Empire of Liberty (Oxford History of America) page 577 reads "Although some of the founders ... were fairly devout Christians, most leading Founders were not deeply or passionately religious and few had much of a spiritual life ... Most of them, at best only passively believed in organized Christianity and, at worst, privately scorned and mocked it."  The leaders of the Revolution were more often men of the Enlightenment than men of the Bible.  
And on page 578 ... "it has been estimated that scarcely one in twenty Americans was a member of a formal member of a church."
The importance of religion ebbs and flows in American history.  As you point out it was very important a number of the colonies I should have said revolutionary , not colonial America), and would rise again during the second Great Awakening, but at the time of the revolution and the nation's founding, American was a largely secular place. (And I've oversimplified the situation in my summary here.  Get a hold of the Empire of Liberty if you want to learn more.  You'll be better informed about the early years of America than almost all your fellow citizens.)

<TEXT> Thanks for the correction, I should have said few rights.  However, while illegal immigrants have rights under the law, the fear of arrest and deportation often means they are afraid to exercise and assert their rights, and have de facto no labor rights.

<TEXT> This is about my favorite comment about work and success. (Not too surprising. I hear you guys who go to MIT are pretty smart.)  I can look at my own career, and I see I've done reasonably well and worked reasonably hard, but luck (my first job happened to give me an opportunity to learn an in-demand skill ) and good judgement (choosing what tech skills to learn next) have had more to do with my success as hard work. There are plenty of people who have worked harder than I have and have a lot less to show for it.  </TEXT>

Furthermore, the travails of workers in rich countries are, in important ways, the flip side of the gains above and below them. Competition from emerging-economy exports has surely been a factor depressing wages in wealthier nations, although probably not the dominant force. More important, soaring incomes at the top were achieved, in large part, by squeezing those below: by cutting wages, slashing benefits, crushing unions, and diverting a rising share of national resources to financial wheeling and dealing.

<TEXT> Education is only mandatory through 16 in most places, but every state I know of provides free education through 18 (or completing high school.)  It's generally held that it's in society's interest to provide education beyond the age when you can drop out of school, and as the world demands more skills, I would argue that extending that further would be in our best interest. 
If Walker is saying that public investments will pay for themselves, like helping finance a public stadium, it seems  that education returns the investment several times over.  Look at the relative incomes of places like Mass or NJ , which spend many on education, vs Mississippi or Alabama, which skimp on it. (Funding public education is really one the oldest debates in US History. Places like New England have always favored spending heavily, the southern states have always opposed it.
I don't know the details of the endowments, but places like UW Madison are also (research centers)[http://www.warf.org/about-us/background/history/history.cmsx ] At least in Wisconsin, it looks like there is a pretty good return on the money.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A weakened IRS is yet another way to push income taxes down.  If business owners and investors are routinely able to understate their income with little chance of an audit, their effective tax rate falls. Income earned through wages is harder to hide, leaving them taxed on their true income. Why the Democrats never make an issue of how Republican anti-IRS policies enable tax cheaters, I can't understand. </TEXT>

But usually they claim to be champions of free enterprise, but find a reason for an exception for themselves or a favored group.  (Paul Ryan on the bank bailouts is a particularly egregious example of this.)  And when something they don't like gets a subsidy, say alternative energy, they throw a fit about favoritism and crony capitalism.  (And I realize I'm generalizing.

Its not expanding the earned income tax credit, but rather pushing a Wall Street wish list for tweaks to weaken the Dodd-Frank financial reform law of 2010.

<TEXT> While wages and incomes have stagnated in the United States (as well as in Japan and large parts of Europe), they have not done so everywhere. In Canada, a broad measure of incomes has risen about 10 percent since 2000, even as its fallen here. In Australia, its up 30 percent  .... What are Canada and Australia doing differently? For starters, they are doing a better job with mass education. They have near-universal preschool, and they both do more to get low-income students through college. In Australia, college is free. Increasingly, the report says, a college education is similar to the high school education of the past  necessary for a prosperous life.The efforts to create a more skilled work force in Canada and Australia (as well as Sweden and some other countries) have led to better jobs  and stronger pretax income growth.
Beyond education, these other countries do more to intervene in the free market on behalf of the middle class and the poor ...Middle-class stagnation is not preordained. No country has found a magic bullet, but many are doing some things better than the United States  and have the better results to show for it.

So which party in the US supports these changes to end middle class wage stagnation ? Doesn't sound like the Republican Party platform to me.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Meanwhile Democrats, who should naturally have the upper hand in any honest fight for the increasingly populist American electorate, were too busy running away from President Obama to embrace the effective aspects of his agenda. As Andrew Sullivan wrote on Election Night, If you wonder, as I do, why Democrats never actually defend their policies or even achievements in power, and run solely on some poll-tested social issues, then your bafflement will likely only increase tonight, as mine has. The New Republics Alec MacGillis noted that in the three states that saw the biggest coverage gains under ObamacareKentucky, Arkansas and West VirginiaDemocratic Senate candidates shied away from pointing that out. And all lost badly, MacGillis tweeted.

Do you think the Democrats will ever offer the electorate a real choice?  Or are we in for more years of 'not quite as horrible as Republicans' as our alternative? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah it  was pretty goddamn disappointing.  Do they really think it's not worth their while, or do they really think there is no difference?  But there's nothing else to do but keep trying to get them to show up.  (More of them will in 2016, almost assuredly. ) They'll vote more when they get older (everyone does because they realize how much politics impacts their lives), and hopefully won't turn so goddamn conservative when they age.  Or maybe something will energize them.  Minority vote was low for a long time, and now it's picked up (some places African American voting participation is higher than among whites. 
I also try not to put too much blame on anyone group. A whole lot of the democratic coalition didn't show up, not just younger people.  Why working class whites never figure out they're electing their worst economic enemies and keep voting Republican, I'll never understand.  And why the Democrats don't draw the contrast between themselves and Republicans in sharp focus, I don't get either.  If they did, they might get a few more young people excited about voting for them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Parental expectations and involvement are the most important ingredient to success in school. (I knew someone whose father was a  massive steelworker who was determined that his children would do well.  She told me there was never any question about doing homework in her house.)  But the isolation of inner city students has a big role in the failure rate and making the schools dysfunctional. I live in a smaller city, not big enough for us to have segregated ourselves too much economically, and all four of our high schools have a significant population of students from impoverished families. (At my kids high school there are students from both the wealthiest part of town and from a couple of rather grim housing projects. ) While the schools have their issues, all of them are reasonably successful and manage to serve economically diverse populations. But that kind of high school has disappeared in most larger urban areas.  Instead we have some schools that serve almost exclusively impoverished students, which clearly has a multiplier effect on the difficulties and discipline issues.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd agree with some of your statement. Building a nice high school building might make it easier to learn, but it doesn't guarantee successful outcomes.  And unfortunately, far too many lower income families don't understand the need to take schooling seriously. 
But ,
1) High school is too late. Student are far better off going to good elementary schools and a lesser quality high school. What a student brings to high school matters more than the school itself.
2) Isolating the poorer students tends to reinforce the social problems. Of course you're going to see more gang activities in one high school if it's the only school attended by kids who tend to get caught up in gangs. If the staff needs to spend a lot of time on disciplinary and violence issues, there's that much less time and resources for teaching, and more disruption. Students who are not disruptive themselves wind up with less education, through no fault of their own. 
3) The quality of the staff probably matters more than the building.  I know in my town we had one elementary school that was barely functional, until they replaced the principal.  The place still has it's issues, but it's a whole lot better. I obviously have no idea what the staff is like in the schools you mentioned, but I think better teachers tend to avoid the worse schools.

Although I disagree with much of what you've said, I think it's a well written and thoughtful comment. Keep at it.

<TEXT> Ruth Ginsburg, in her dissent on the supreme Court decision,  has a different view about Texas IDs.

Texas will not accept several forms of photo ID permitted under the Wisconsin law the Court considered last week. For example, Wisconsins law permits a photo ID from an in- state four-year college and one from a federally recognized Indian tribe. Texas, under Senate Bill 14, accepts neither. Nor will Texas accept photo ID cards issued by the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Those who lack the approved forms of identification may obtain an election identification certificate from the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), but more than 400,000 eligible voters face round-trip travel times of three hours or more to the nearest DPS office.Moreover, applicants for an election identification certificate ordinarily must present a certified birth certificate [which] can be obtained only at significant costat least $22 for a standard certificate sent by mail.

<TEXT> 1) If the legislators pushing voter ID were truly worried about voter fraud, they would make provisions so every voter had an ID. When you have laws in Texas that make a gun ID valid for voting (more often owned by conservatives) and a student ID not valid (a group that tends to vote more liberal), it strains credulity to think it's only about voter fraud.
2) In person voter fraud is insignificant, less that a rounding error. I'd be far more concerned about who counts the votes.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Despite the conflicting nature of these left and right analyses, there is a strong case to be made that they are, in fact, complementary and that they reinforce each other. What if we put it together this way? Automation, foreign competition and outsourcing lead to a decline in well-paying manufacturing jobs, which, in turn, leads to higher levels of unemployment and diminished upward mobility, which then leads to fewer marriages, a rise in the proportion of nonmarital births, increased withdrawal from the labor force, impermanent cohabitation and a consequent increase in dependence on government support. The major roadblock to synthesizing competing explanations has been  and continues to be  political polarization. Vested interests on the left and right have delayed, and in some cases prevented, recognition of the overlap between liberal and conservative hypotheses, and have pointedly ignored evidence that contradicts their preconceived partisan positions.

Most of what you need to know about the causes poverty in America and our inability to reduce it in a few sentences.

<TEXT> The fourth view, closest to my own, is that the problem is fundamentally one of economics and economic history: Having been formally shut out of much of the economy until within recent memory, African Americans simply lag behind the average. The relatively fast economic advancement of other minority groups, such as Vietnamese immigrants, does not negate that premise: The history and position of black Americans is fundamentally different from that of immigrant groups. American institutions expended a great deal of effort to help assimilate and advance Vietnamese refugees, while many of those institutions had spent a solid century after the Civil War working to prevent the assimilation and advancement of African Americans.

I'm rather surprised to see a paragraph like this in the National Review.  I wonder how many of Williamson's fellow conservatives agree with it. Not many, I'd think. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As John Stuart Mill, the British political economist, argued, people should be free to do as they please, provided they dont cause undue harm to others. But greenhouse gases have already caused great harm and threaten much worse. Mills cost-benefit framework provides no reason for thinking that someones freedom to escape the small burden of CO2 taxation should trump other, vastly more important freedoms. To the contrary, he said, restrictions on individual liberty are needed when the health and safety of the great mass of people and the purity of the natural environment are at stake.

It makes good economic sense to be a climate change denier if you're a heavy CO2 user or producer. If you argue that the problem doesn't exist, you can't be harming anyone else, and you don't need to pay to clean up your messes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wasn't commenting on the on the proposal, but on Ryan's veracity. It seems to me that people who I've found to be dishonest tend to stay dishonest (and I don't care if you're talking about finance , romance or politics), and you should look at any proposal from such people skeptically. Perhaps you've had better experiences with reformed prevaricators than I have.    But turning to the proposal itself, I'm surprised by how much there is to like in it. Lower incarceration rates and increasing the EIC for childless adults, if it were any Republican but Paul Ryan suggesting this, he'd be getting jumped on for having become a squishy moderate.  There are also a number of dubious ideas, such as replacing programs with block grants to local governments.  I would imagine that places like Minnesota and Nebraska we'd see well run programs with impartial administrators, and in places like Chicago and Louisiana you'll see the grants abused for political favoritism, if not actually stolen.  There's also one genuinely laughable idea, life coaches.  We've had 'life coaches' for the poor since Jane Adams' Hull House, except for they're called social workers.  Relabeling them life coaches isn't going to make it any easier to transform people's lives. But here's the real problem with Ryan's plan.  Do you see any discussion about the change in [ income distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States )   in the United States over the last 50 years?  In fact, hit crtl-F, type in distribution and see how many times and where the word turns up.    How can you claim to be discussing 'Opportunity in America' and how government programs have failed  to end poverty and ignore the fact that the income of the lowest quintile has fallen so greatly compared to everyone else?  Perhaps the problem isn't really the personal pathologies among the poor, or the ineffectiveness of government programs, but a increasingly unfair economic system.  I suspect that Ryan doesn't want that discussion started, so he's hiding the ball here. Its just his latest in his long line of distortions ,dissemblings and dishonesties.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> But where Ryan and others get it wrong is in their pervasive assumption that all you have to do to get a job is want a job. In this regard, here is what you need to know about work requirements: in the absence of strong labor demand, such requirements are a recipe for more, not less, poverty.

Why is it so hard to understand?  Do conservatives think the unemployment rate went from 4.7% in January 2006 to 9.7% in January 2011 because Americans became lazier and less willing to work over those 5 years? </TEXT>

The comical political starfcking that is its primary raison d'erp has finally crossed over into $10 meth-whoring on the Singapore docks. Once a mere surface irritation, Tiger Beat On The Potomac has finally crossed over into being a thickly pustulating chancre on the craft of journalism. It has demonstrated its essential worthlessness. It has demonstrated that it has the moral character of a sea-slug and the professional conscience of the Treponema pallidum spirochete. Trust me. Stephen Glass never sunk this low. Mike (Payola) Allen has accomplished the impossible. He's made Jayson Blair look like Ernie Pyle.

WASHINGTON  It was one of the final pieces of legislation **signed into law by President George W. Bush**, a measure that passed without controversy, along with a pension bill and another one calling for national parks to be commemorated on quarters.  This is a piece of legislation were very proud to sign, a White House spokesman, Tony Fratto, told reporters on Dec. 23, 2008, as the president put his pen to the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, named for a 19th-century British abolitionist. This program has been very effective around the world in trying to stop trafficking in persons.

But reform conservatism must still prove itself to be more than a slogan, more than a marketing campaign, more than that new pizza box. The Reformicons can be part of the historic correction the conservative movement badly needsor they can settle for being sophisticated enablers of more of the same.

Right now reformers have no meaningful influence in the Republican Party.

I love these articles. The authors never seem to pick up that the Republicans **never find something they would like to do instead**. Or rather they always want to do the same thing instead, which is lower taxes on the wealthy.

Although some gun-rights advocates talk as though gun control were a modern, 20th-century invention of an increasingly meddlesome government, the historical passages in Gunfight suggest otherwise. Not only did the nations founders balance gun rights with public safety needs, Mr. Winkler says, but the wild, wild west wasnt all that wild. According to the research of one scholar he cites, almost everyone carried firearms in the untamed wilderness, which was full of dangerous American Indians, outlaws and bears, but in the towns where people lived and businesses operated, there were often blanket ordinances against the carrying of arms by anyone. One of the towns with strict rules was the notorious Dodge City, Kan. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ripping off a song you heard by another performer and trying to take credit for writing it? Here's [somebody else](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Got_My_Mojo_Working#Litigation) who did  that .  It's as old as the blues, and probably almost as old as music. 
Still I think Led Zeppelin has been notably egregious in borrowing and not giving proper credit.  The worst case  was "Bring it on Home", where Robert Plant imitates Sonny Boy Williamson for the first verse and chorus and the song's ending, yet Williamson and Dixon received no credit. (Jimmy Page tried to dismiss it an homage to Sonny Boy, and claimed it was 'only a few seconds of music'.) Compare them to the Rolling Stones , who covered many old blues songs and always gave credit, used blues bands for their opening acts and even got Howling Wolf a slot to perform on Shindig!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure, but let's also remember that the OWS was a genuine grass roots movement, not an astroturf outside funded movement like the Tea Party.  I'm inclined to think social movements often sputter out a couple of times before they catch fire.  It's not like civil rights movement began the day Rosa Parks decided not to give up her seat on the bus.  If OWS turns out to be a only catalyst, that might be all America is ready for.

<TEXT> As he observes, the most radical pro-ALEC governor is Walker, whose tax-cutting and anti-union zeal has propelled him into the race for the GOP Presidential nomination for 2016. His state's economic performance has been dismal, as ALEC's own figures show. Walker predicted that his policies would result in job growth of 250,000; so far he's fallen short by more than 94,000. 

And if that's not enough.

What's worst about these ALEC policies, Chinn reports, is that the relentless budget-cutting they require leave crucial state services, particularly education, gasping for breath. That's a formula for long-term decline, not growth.

The Republican party, mean-spirited and short sighted.

<TEXT> If you want to read a refutation of this article, read the New York Times article it [links to](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/26/business/economy/making-sense-of-income-inequality.html?_r=1).  Especially the last few paragraphs. 

One of the plausible consequences of rising inequality is that it allows the 1 percent to take control of the political system, purchasing the power needed to maintain the status quo. If that is the case  and there is plenty of suggestive evidence of this  the widening of the income gap would prove irreversible. Mr. Jencks describes the state of the debate between friends and foes of inequality in these terms: Can I prove that anything is terrible because of rising inequality? Not by the kind of standards I would require. But can they prove I shouldnt worry? They cant do that either. That, alone, is enough to spur action. Something that looks bad is coming at you, he said. Saying that we shouldnt do anything about it until we know for sure would be a bad response.

That last statement is also a pretty good argument for starting to make the adjustments needed for climate change, starting now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Studies show that as many as 11 percent of eligible voters do not have government-issued photo ID. That percentage is even higher for seniors, people of color, people with disabilities, low-income voters, and students. Many citizens find it hard to get government photo IDs, because the underlying documentation like birth certificates (the ID one needs to get ID) is often difficult or expensive to come by. At the same time, voter ID policies are far more costly to implement than many assume. Instead, Improvements in voting technology and modernization of our voter registration system will both increase efficiency and close the door on mistakes and fraud.

Even the [National Review](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/375765/rand-pauls-foreign-policy-situation-room-or-dorm-room-rich-lowry) and [Right Turn](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2013/04/29/dont-be-a-jerk-sen-cruz/) find these 'gentleman' lacking. And Ryan seems to missed some basic rules in his upbringing, [about telling the truth](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/post/paul-ryans-dishonest-speech/2012/08/30/16bb62d8-f24f-11e1-adc6-87dfa8eff430_blog.html). </TEXT>

<TITLE> If you require every American citizen to read one book, what would you chose? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Empire of Liberty](http://www.amazon.com/Empire-Liberty-History-Republic-1789-1815/dp/0199832463) is my choice.   Misinformation about the Founding Fathers intents and America's early years are used to justify all brands of nonsense.  It would be harder to get away with if we all had a basic understanding of our history. Well written book too.

Edit to include the book title, not just the link. And I missed a word in the title 'If you **could** require...' </TEXT>
