<TEXT> Its something that's been talked about for years and every major sport has huge alcohol sponsorship and advertising how much longer until you think they ban it? 

Personally I hope they don't unless another sponsor is ready to take its place as they do give the sports a ton of cash and I don't really see who would be willing to put that much money into it.  </TEXT>

a few things about the gameplay that you might not like

potions can't be drunk during combat you have to drink them beforehand (this includes potions like swallow)

no climbing or jumping down unless there is a certain spot the game allows it

no fast travel or horses </TEXT>

i get that i have a lot of skills and good armor and what not at that point but some of the monsters and even high level enemies put up a better fight than him

i didn't even need to use a single potion as it was just way too easy to dodge and when he was using magic he was basically a sitting duck

was a bit a of a disappointment after everything you had to do to prepare to fight him for him to go down so easily </TEXT>

abbot was able to capitalise on that so changing it now wouldn't be a good idea.

i know many people on this sub would want to see a greens style approach to it but that's not what the greater majority of voters want and it could lose votes for whatever party tries to do it. </TEXT>

really sick of the parents that just allow kids to run around screaming in public and make excuses like they are finding their voice or we where all kids once.. those excuses just mean they are bad parents that can't control their kids

<TEXT> no one is getting fired they are taking a paycut on the already high wages they earn (some are on 150k or more)

besides the ceo taking a paycut to keep paying workers the same amount of money is not going to fix anything they would still be losing money as costs would be the same

just because a CEO has money in the bank doesn't mean they have to run the company at a loss that would just lead to workers getting fired in the long run when they lose more and more money </TEXT>

<TEXT> it's declining and has been for a while it's the whole reason why there was that meeting to discuss changes and why so many past and present drivers are suggesting ideas to make it interesting again.

sure there are fans that love it how it is but without new fans coming in the sport can't survive.

the biggest complaint i see from people who are not diehard fans is that it's boring and predictable, it's not helped that it went from 4 years of vettel domination (even with those 2 close years) to the current 2 years of utter complete Mercedes domination.

so would i he was jailed for threatening to kill asio and other government staff and traveled to Syria during the Arab spring

he clearly supports ISIS and has no place in civilised society

if he's left unchecked he could easily become the next man monis

you can easily switch to part or full time after school or stay casual if you have uni and make money

my guess is some people quit after they turn 18 because they don't want to work in fast food anymore due to embarrassment or something </TEXT>

We just came out of 4 years of red bull to go straight into 2 years of complete Mercedes domination (who knows if the same will happen next year)

some teams are struggling to even finish a race.. Rosberg doesn't have what it takes to challenge Hamilton, the Ferrari's have improved but not enough to pose a threat to the Mercedes and we have yet to see a good vettel kimi battle because something always fucks it

williams not good enough to keep up with the ferrari so we can expect the same results each race 1.hamilton 2 rosberg 3 vettel 4 kimi 5-6 bottas/massa

seriously getting over the glitches this fucking game has (not to mention the lag)

<TEXT> progress rewards are 2500 vials and 1 iso 3500 vials 2 iso 10 iso and last prize premium portal and 10 ISO

the entire event (and leaderboard) is based on how many enemies you can kill.. 

doens't matter if you score 20 million it's based on the amount of enemies killed

not sure who gives the bonus if there even is one... i've got 80 enemies so far and i'm in 486th place don't play often enough to score higher in events like these </TEXT>

<TEXT> i try to use my highest level spiders with a bulletproof as the main one due to the abilities of near miss and extra points from enemy kills.. 

my multiplier is 33 and if i have a good run i can get around 2.5-3 million average runs if at least 1 million

other then that it's just down to luck.. only use ISO to continue a run if you are sure you can get a higher score for a good prize otherwise it's just a waste </TEXT>

just score enough to get them on the daily leader board or try to get 50 iso-8 and buy the discount ones or get them in events

i think they increased it because it's 50 ISO-8 but it's hard to achieve
i wouldn't mind if it was less ISO-8 so more people could actually have a chance to earn it </TEXT>

the amount of iso-8 you need to level up is ridiculous and you got to be lucky to get 4-5 of the same premium card and another 2 to level them up

obviously geared to get people to pay otherwise it would take months to even get enough (other endless runner games aren't this bad)
