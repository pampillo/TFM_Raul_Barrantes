<TEXT> Bro. Just go full speedo brief. I know it may seem weird but the difference is astounding. All my teammates wear them and all professionals do. If my suit is exceptionally loose I might wear another brief under it but that's rare. Try it. Forget what other people think and play like a champ. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If its a technique problem make sure you are correctly using your arms in your approach. Also make sure you are bending your knees enough and riding the board up making sure you get enough height up. If all else fails, leg workouts like squats, lunges, etc. will help you with height. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really don't know too much you can do because I believe it does partially have to do with hand size. However there's hope that maybe your practice balls are a bit worn. Our team sets aside 3 balls that are top notch and only designated for games, so maybe that'll help your cause. Also maybe just work on some ball handling skills in practice. For instance not picking the ball up on top, or maybe turning your hand during your pump fakes to so it wont fall out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The main goal is to ride the board up. I used to throw my dives early and hard and ya I would get around because it was fast but my height would suffer. Give it a strong push and don't throw for your dive until the board is finished pushing you up. It's hard to get the timing but after a while with someone watching you you'll get the hang of it. </TEXT>
