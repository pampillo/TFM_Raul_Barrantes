And for y'all that think that's rude.. I'll tell you why it's not.  Some of the subreddits have changed in the past few years bc of lies and false posts.  Look at r/food for instance.  All u see these days is stock photos with watermarks cropped out, and people claiming they actually made it.

<TEXT> Hey, fellow WVD!  When I was diagnosed at birth, my parent's didn't get too involved, but as I got older I wanted to learn everything there is to know.  I also used to work for NHF, so if you have any questions, feel free to PM me.  

[National Hemophilia Foundation](http://www.hemophilia.org/Bleeding-Disorders/Types-of-Bleeding-Disorders) is a good start to understand the basics as well as other bleeding disorders.  Also, you can 1.800.42.HANDI and ask for any VWD educational info.  They will send it to you free of charge

I would also contact your local chapter depending on what city/state you live in.  They will be a good resource for you depending on the types of programs they offer. 

If you don't know yet, you must learn to self infuse.  Your HTC should teach you this.  

I'm sure other people in this sub will chime in.  Good luck and no worries </TEXT>

Maybe it was b.c there wasn't much to cheer about, but I don't remember getting annoyed since I didn't mind listening to him on KNBR.

Clearly, the sign didn't matter as the passengers (mostly Chinese) all used the toilet.  About 2 hours into the ride and the entire bus smells like a septic tank.  Literally the entire bus smelled like shit and none of the Chinese passengers seemed to mind.  It was still day 1 of the trip </TEXT>

Another topic I like to bring up at sports bars is the excitement Curry brings to the NBA.  The last time I felt as though a player could dominate a game was MJ/Kobe.  There's times when everyone stops what they're doing and just watches Curry drop 3's from downtown.  The last player to capture that kind of excitement was Jordan.  And please, this is not an comparison of players.  Just a comparison of how dominating and exciting these 2 players are </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you're able to create+ taste what was posted, you could work at any restaurant in NYC or in the world.  

The chefs that work at Eleven Madison usually go onto opening their own restaurants and those joints become well known.  

I get that a carrot seems so simple.  Having lived in different countries, I realized how much better produce is compared to the US.  

Perfect example?  Chicken sashimi in Japan.  Unheard of here right?  But what if the chicken was killed that morning by a person that specializes in certain breeds and its been handled for generations.  It tasted so clean, I had nothing to worry about. 

My point is, the food that you're used to, depending on where your from isnt comparable to what your seeing in this post </TEXT>

Shooter sandwich, In and Out, charcuterie and cheese are all front page click bait.  Funny thing is, some of the pics are stock photos!  Some go even as far as cropping out the watermark.


What I'm trying to get at is, there's the older reddit population (30+) and younger generation and its evident when you read some of the comments in here.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Daring to go out on a limb here and risk the divide, but I think the demographics of r/49ers goes something like this:  Old timer fans, and New Generation fans

Early days fan born late 70's-early 80's= Fortunate to witness multiple Super Bowls, Joe Montana, etc...I myself was lucky to see this.  

Newer Gen Fans= Abysmal years Nolan, Singletary, etc..Then its Harbs and Kaep and we got ourselves a new team, new identity.  

I'm not dogging either one, but you can tell the discrepancy when reading posts and pics, comments, whatever.  But you did bring up a very good point, which is football discussions are very hard to relate in this sub.  I believe it's the generation divide amongst the fan base.

<TEXT> The year Baltimore won it all, John Harbaugh fired his O.C midseason.  Unheard of, and ballsy, but it was the move that put them over the top.  Keep in mind, the O.C Cam Cameron was Harbaugh's close friend.  

Now flip the script and look at Jim.  He's loyal to a fault, which most likely cost him his job.  He should have been held accountable and I wouldn't to waste/risk next year retaining Jim and watching the same anemic offense we have for the past 2 years.  

his is the difference maker between the 2 brothers.  Jim is rowdy, ra-ra-ra, and loya, John is on the sidelines, composed and calm but rational.  There's some eerie similarities between SF+Baltimore, but the Ravens are coached way more efficiently with far less talent that SF.

We have a win now mentality, and our window is closing quickly.  Again, I really don't think Jed and Trent are that petty and sensitive that they're letting jim go simply bc they dislike him.  

We're taking a humongous gamble here, but seeing how progressive we've been in literally every other business scenario, I'm at peace with this.   I for one can't stomach another dismal offense, and waste another year which it sounds like was going to happen since jim refused to let roman go </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm with you re Balke, and although he has made many good picks, the person prior to him is worthy of mention.  

Scott Mclouglin was the G.M before while Balke was the understudy.  Most folks jump to praise Balke, but let's not forget how who the person was before.  
And no surprise, after Sf fired Mcloughlin, Seattle hired him for a quick second.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Posted this in a similar thread:  
If you look at the past 3 seasons, it's been a different team in stark contrasts.
 Year 1, Harbaugh and Roman simplify the playbook and cater to Alex strengths. Remember the genius naked QB bootleg against the Saints in the playoffs? Where has that gone? The offense that year was pretty dismal at times, but we played really disciplined. There were a lot of shits, 2 TE sets, etc. Low scoring affairs, but the D was monster that year.

Year 2, we unleash Colin and the read option. Now the O is passing down the field more often, letting Colin run wild. In all the midst of it, the play calling changed and started to see more delay of games, weird run calls, etc. Let's not forget the last play of the Super Bowl.

Year 3. In the off season, both Harbs and Roman both agreed to clean and simplify the calls and terminology. What happened to our 2TE sets, or jumbo package for ground and pound?  How come Kap still throws 90+ mph fastballs to his receivers only a few feet away?  All these what and why ?s </TEXT>

<TEXT> My own take on this, and from what I observed living in not so great areas, i.e West Oakland and Riverside County.  When it gets hot, people like to drink more, that's a given.  

I noticed the liquor stores got busier, and the prices of 40 oz's dropped a little.  It's a cycle that doesn't stop.  People get drunk, sometimes get more irritable bc of the heat, drink more because their irritable, etc.  

Then you mix that with violence, and with school being out kids being bored, and it's a perfect recipe for crime.  I have no stats on this, just personal observation, but it's a theme that occurs every summer.  And chances are, the hotter it gets, more violence.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> where on this post was it noted that I didn't credit the F.O?  With all these moves being made, and the F.O trying to win a championship, if these moves end up being disastrous, who gets the blame?  That was the message of this post 

You can claim we had the best starting line up, which is arguable.  I don't think we do, nor do we have a championship roster at this moment.

<TEXT> With GS being in the news spotlight and all, we are now under more scrutiny than ever before.  One thing I'm curious about is the "blame game"  that might happen if we don't win, or exceed expectations.  

For instance, we had a bad bench and blame can be put on Myers and company for providing Mjax with such a shitty 2nd group.  I will give Myers some credit for the trade of Steve Blake.  However, we went into the season with Toney Douglas as the back up PG.  Did he really think that was going to work?  

So the question is, at what point is it more a personnel issue (meaning players and how they're utilized) and a coach issue?  I'm expecting us to make major roster moves this summer, and if the trade doesn't work in our favor, who gets the blame?  I guess my point is, how many freebies does Myers and West get?  Is Lacob so blinded and so awe struck by his F.O that he won't hold them accountable?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Look I get it, drivers can be ruthless.  I drive everyday in this city and try not to block the box, but when you need to move out of on coming traffic there's not much you can do.  The car in front can move as much as possible, but the Times Sq area is a cluster.  Unless you have driven that area, its almost impossible not to break laws.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> The flip side is most of the people that come to NYC only stay for a few years, maybe 10 tops.  Although there is a constant rotation of in/ out, the native folks get the short end.  

I told this to someone earlier, although I may claim NY as my home, home is really the people that have roots here.  Those folks likely won't be leaving this city, and it's not by choice.  This realization made me become way more tolerant of this city and of the people.  .

The fact that thread got upvoted is ridiculous.  This summer alone I saw 4 Smith threads, which shows fans aren't over it still.  In fact, 1 Redditor even made the claim, "Alex Smith is still one of us"  
I question the Smith fans. Straight UP.   </TEXT>

That being said, can people recommend reasonable hikes and places to check out without it being too strenuous.  Also, what are some good hotels within a 45 min drive outside of Yosemite?  It seems as though most are inside (all booked) our they're super far like 1 hr 30 min (Oakhurst, Coarsegold). Is there something in between?   </TEXT>

Ahead in line were a couple of young grungy looking kids, no big deal.  They leave, and we're up next.  Both kids leave their ATM receipt behind.  Curious me goes and picks up their receipt to peak.  Low and behold both kids savings account was over 400K.  Now I'm not generalizing that all young cats in NY are trust fund kids, but that day confirmed just the ridiculous amount of wealth that people in NY are running around with.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a double edged sword with Lee.  In all his years, whenever he's forced to play center, he doesn't do well match up wise and #'s wise.  However, stick a center next to him and he flourishes.  Less pressure off him to perform, plays decent weakside D, and gobbles tons of boards due to the Center boxing out.  I still think you keep him next year, but wouldn't be surprised if we trade mid way next year, especially if we're not doing good as a team </TEXT>

You display zero knowledge of the game, and it's obvious you can't get enough of Alex's dick.  Wait till week 3 next year when Alexis will be getting booed off the field.  I'll be waiting to hear your excuse then.  "Oh it's because the Chiefs have no O line, he has no weapons"  GTFO kid </TEXT>

The idea is to cook all the of outward facing meat fibers to kill of disease that may have made contact.  Since these diseases dont penetrate into the flesh, deep frying or poaching for just a few minutes will kill off disease.](http://tonguecheek.com/2010/05/ask-a-chef-can-you-eat-raw-chicken/comment-page-1/)

2 years ago in NYC, I was busted for smoking a joint on the street. The court decided to offer an A.C.D (Adjournment of contemplation dismissal) if I didnt get into trouble after a year. My case would then be sealed.

<TEXT> The road to the Superbowl goes thru the Giants.  Alex played em 2x, and failed.  I'll give the benefit of the doubt from last years's depleted receiving core, but this year he has weapons.  

If Harb was able to get a player with a low ceiling and get him to max out, how far can he take a player with a much greater potential?  Our coaching staff was so clever and amazing with Alex, just imagine what they have in store for Kaep.  They've been game planning for Kaep, they will put him in situations to succeed.   </TEXT>

We ride n die as a team, no throwing anyone under the bus.  It's not about, "Alex wouldn't have made that mistake, or Kaep was too young"  I'm done with this rant, let's go Niners.   </TEXT>

Ill give some benefit of the doubt to Alex last year bc of the depleted receiving core, but no excuse for this years giants game.  3 int's, and that's with suped up WR's.

But from what I've seen, kaep has done it more than Alex has in his given time. Whether he can do it for more than 2 years up is remained to be seem, but you can argue that there is a qb debate .

<TEXT> At the end, the goal is to win a Superbowl.  And right now, what's standing between us and a Superbowl is a QB IMO.  My point of "pulling the trigger" means that we push the ball and make plays.  Not go for the safe read that Alex does over and over.  

I never mentioned once about entertainment in my post.  I'm saying Kaep is making plays, and is doing so in ways I haven't seen Alex do in the last 7 years.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been watching the games.  What I didn't emphasize in my post (which I should have) is that in 1 game, we saw Kaep pull the trigger more times than I've seen Alex.  

You provided proof in your post with plays he did, but in all honesty you're bringing up 2 plays from 2 different games.  .  I know it's only been 1 game with Kaep, but again he's not shy and he's pulling the trigger on plays.  The game you mentioned 80 yd bomb with Ted Ginn, Alex also missed a wide open Delanie Walker post 1st play of the game.  
And that's where I notice the contrast of QB's.  Alex is safe, cerebral, will not push it down field.  Kaep makes plays with his feet, often improvising which results in bigger plays.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exactly this.  Not once have I ever seen Alex try and throw the 20 yard out pattern towards the sidelines.  Or go for the bomb.  If you watch the replay again, kaep does exactly that on the initial drive.  

Alex might have the "cerebral" aspect of the game, but kaep makes plays period.  Kaep has "it".  Alex, not as much  </TEXT>

I took his advice to heart, and really pushed the boundaries.  To summarize, I met a amazing woman and got married last year.  As for my friend (the one with the advice), he came to NY with less than 1K in his bank account and minimal experience as a stylist.  He know styles hair for all the major fashion shoots, is known and respected internationally.

<TEXT> My counterpoint.  Lived in the hood before, have hood friends, have done hood shit.  None of that shit scares me.  What does scare me is folks like you. Reasons why below

You're general stereotype reasoning of "pencil thin mustache, earrings, little thug lingo"  shows me just how fucking unintelligent and ignorant you are.  Which gives me enough reason to understand, that you don't know what it's like to be on other side. You'll never know.  Most of us on here are fortunate enough not to.  But it's views like yours that exist and to know you could be in a higher position than the kid in the video and therefore use your reasoning and judge the kid negatively

In your case, your broad based assumptions, along with your narrow sighted views are what enrage me, and will lead me to call you out on your BS.  The cops have no right treating anyone like that.  The kid should suffer and get harrassed because of another person with the same background committed a crime?  Your god damn right you go no problem with what the cops did, because you'll never fuckin get it.   </TEXT>

I can tell you straight up my friends that live in the hood, have pride. They don't consider themselves anything, nonetheless victims. You're making a assumption.  

This topic is all about the kid, and how he is perceived.  You said he walks and talks like a thug.  What's your basis?  This debate is about how you should explain yourself.  B/C if you truly think this kid is what a thug embodies both external and internal experience, you would be terrified thinking every single male youth in the inner city is a thug.  I disagree with every point you bring, not because of you.  Because there is no validity.  You're trying to sink this argument down to something else.  So, care to explain more?   </TEXT>

Grades might not be distinguished the same as beef (prime, choice, etc) but fresh fish that I was eating daily in Japan+NYC was "sashimi grade" compared to the places you've worked i.e (farm rasied)  Dunno where you live, but in NYC where I work and live, sashimi is flown in from Japan+Australia daily.  

I agree places like Whole Foods will get away with their "sashimi" but scientific fact, when the brain of the fish is pierced and lactic acid is minimal, you're getting the best of the best.  I know that's what I'm getting.   </TEXT>

I haven't done a background search on myself yet, but from what I've read the ACD is sealed from any outside sources.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Busted last summer on the corner of Bleeker and Bowery.  3 of us were passing a joint around on the street, cop car pulled up and arrested us on the spot.  

The time frame last about 3 1/2 hours from beginning to end.  After getting printed, processed, and what seemed like an eternity, we were let go.  My court date was 2 months later.  That lasted 15 min tops, judge gave me a A.C.D (Adjournment for Court Dismissal). End of story.

<TEXT> I was fortunate to go to private school bc my parents (japanese) believed in good education.  About 90% of my classmates were white, (wealthy white) while the other 10% were asian+black.  I was able to attend bc of finanical aid.  At a early age I saw firsthand just how different a mindset these kids had vs the minorities.  It was self entitlement and this general attitude of being spoiled and saying/doing outrageous shit thinking it's completely acceptable. 


The one thing I still get annoyed with is when I deal with entitled rich white punks who think they run the shit.  It's a certain arrogance and mindset that exists.  Now that I'm living in NYC I see it 24-7 especially around midtown.  My friends and I like to call them Chad's + Brad's and or Wall St Douchebags.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to work for a home health care agency, part of the job was to deliver meds to people with chronic illness.  One client was a 17 year old with severe arthritis which prompted him to be dependent on pain killers.  Month by month I noticed his orders of opiates began to increase not only in quantity but strength.  He began to lose weight fast, and his skin color was pale from being indoors.  It got so bad  there would be times I would go over to his house and while we were talking he would doze off in mid sentence.

One day during my delivery, I pulled him aside and told him my concern.  Of course this could have totally gotten me fired bc it really wasn't any of my business, but I felt the need to say something.  It was a short stern talk, and really didn't expect much from it.  

A year later, and I moved to NY and I get a friend request from him on Facebook.  My eyes began to water as I looked thru his pictures.  Not only did he move out of his home, he got a job working IT, became super fit and tanned.  He thanked me the talk because no one else (not even mom) gave a shit.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Backstory:  Last nite I left the front window open in my living room, woke up in the morning to find the screen window busted open and 2 of my wife's lap tops missing.  The laptops were sitting on the couch.  It was a pretty brave move on the burglars part, only because he would have had to actually open a gate, peak in from a ledge, and then break the screen.  Either way, it was a shitty feeling, and we should have known better.  


So we decide to call the cops, 4 huge dudes (more like gorillas) came in did some paper work, told us a detective would come by to do some prints.  They told us not to touch a thing because its all evidence, blah blah, and handed us a "incident information slip".  They gave us a # to call to report this matter in order to receive a complaint report #.  We've tried calling this number all day yesterday and today, no answer.   


I'm in no way expecting to find my laptop, I know its a lost cause.  But is this really the case where cops come in, give you a slip of paper and act like they're working only to have you run in circles?  Why couldn't they issue a Report # on the spot so a file could be started?  Anyone else have similar incidents?    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exactly this.  I'd like to know the backstory to this.  Was there hardcore texts being passed back n forth?  Were they drunk as hell?  It was their first time hooking up, and they went dominant rough right from the start.  That's an open invitation right there.  I'm not saying what the guy did was right, but there's many variables that come into play here.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> What kind of messages were said back and forth leading up to this?    Clearly this guy took it overboard and violated you, but if you showed signs of wanting to be dominated and taken, this goes both ways.  This was your first time hooking up, you're gonna be going 100 m.p.h with excitement and such.

You've got to pony up a little bit and think what drove this guy to lose it.  Was there booze involved, how many texts back and forth were there, nature of conversation, etc.  Cops are gonna be all over this asking you how you even allowed him to enter your house and hook up?  As much as you are the victim here, when the cops question you and the incident, you need to make sure everything adds up.  There is a huge grey area when it comes to this unfortunately.

Long story short, the moment we landed we broke up which was Valentines Day.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Japanese fella here.  Although the dad is clearly being abusive, it's sorta common for the men to just yell at their wives.  It's Old School mentality.  Is it right?  Absolutely not, but the mom doesn't have alot of options. It's not like here in the states where there's support groups, organizations etc.  Sadly, psycho social support in Japan is not on top of the list.  

And unless there is complete followthru, I actually disagree and she shouldn't inform the organization.  She's only staying for a year or two tops, it's a different dynamic she's witnessing than if she were there for 5 years.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm simply calling you out on your "I'm from Texas" statement.  Your references of beef, eggs, and music are all 1 dimensional.  If Texas was even remotely as diverse as SF, I wouldn't even trip.  
 
For example, what's Texas eggs? Drenched in oil, butter, add tons bacon, potatoes.  I don't have an issue if you don't like Japanese eggs, but again I wouldn't bet the house on anything culinary from Texas.  Who is your famous chef?  Tim Love, cmon now.    

Texas Music, first that comes to mind, twangy whack ass country music.  Again how many dimensons?  I can say legitimately that SF is diverse and we can back up our arguments across the board from music to food.  And yes I'm also Japanese so I do know the culture and the gentle complex flavors that are associated with our food.  

Finally fuck the Cowboys!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Grades might not be the best motivator for learning, but as a whole we've taken out the concept of competition + challenge.  Now this might be due to the fact I grew up in a Asian house hold where grades were the end all be all.  But I notice these days, we coddle our children too much where there are no losers.  Watch this piece on 60 min about "Millenials"  and you'll see the result happening.  (http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/11/08/60minutes/main3475200.shtml)

The motivation has to come from parents, but grades can be a motivational booster.  Who doesn't want to score the least amongst your friends in class?  It's competition, something we've abandoned and have now let kids feel entitled.   </TEXT>

As for the cabbage part, I like doing with a modern twist.  Slice cabbage and saute in olive oil, S+P.  Meanwhile reduce some balsamic vinegar til reduces and becomes a syrup.  Drizzle balsamic over cabbage, drink the other 2 Guinness and begin bar hopping.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're question is 2 part.  #1, 49ers are contenders.  Week in and week out we play competitively, enough to make the game close.  

Which leads to #2.  Alex Smith IS not the 49ers.  He's not greatest, we put him in situations that'll help us win.  Call it what you want, he manages the games and he makes enough plays.  But our Defense is legit, enough to be considered a contender.  Our special teams is elite, and our Run Offense is one of the best.  All those make the 49ers contenders.  If you don't agree then you're watching another type of football.

<TEXT> I was at The Venitian in Las Vegas for a bachelor party.  A bunch of us were partying in the room with strippers, booze, drugs.  
The strippers weren't the hottest, and their attitude really sucked.  They were demanding $$$ for bullshit, for instance 50.00 per dance, 100.00 for their clothes off.  We got sick of them quick and kicked them out.  That pissed them off because a few minutes later, security knocked on the door.  They forced their way in, and raided the place.  5 ginourmous guards stormed in shouting at us demanding to show us where to drugs were.  Luckily we flushed the coke, but couldn't hide the weed.  
They found the OZ of weed, took all our pics with us holding our drivers license, and that's why I can never step foot in the Venitian again.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Occupy Wall Street, Typcial American Behavior?   </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-09-28 16:40:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My thoughts are very raw on this matter.  Just a few weeks ago, the whole city commemorated 9/11, by remembering the brave fireman, cops, citizens etc.  There was a feeling of peace, respect, and more importantly UNITY.  The whole world watched as we mourned and came together as a city.   
Fast forward to Occupy Wall Street, and it's like we took a 180 degree turn.  Now don't get me wrong, I am in full support of the protests, and hope their voice is heard globally.  And yes, the COPS fucked up on this.     
Having lived in NYC for 2 years now, I've concluded NYPD is a bunch of assholes, and there is almost a sort of pedestal these guys expect to be on after 9/11.  Now after this last incident, they're rep is back to being shit, and there's a feeling of "Us vs Them"  
As a society, when 9/11 comes around again next year do we all have pity and bow our heads to pay respects to Cops?  This ass backwards behavior US has is least surprising IMO.  And once again the whole world watches as we collide and crash against each other, making us look juvenile and incapable of handling crisis.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Not literally...

Usually my approach has been direct, sometimes too much. The way I see it, if the girl bites then game one. There are times it gives off the relationship vibe too early, which has come back to bite me in the ass. How do I change this up so I can still appear interested without giving away too much? The backstory to this was that I met a amazing girl that just got out of a relationship. I tried taking the slow route, but it ended up backfiring. And I knew she was into me.

She's turning 28 next month, I'm 33. I'm pretty blunt usually, sometimes too straight forward. It kinda got awkward with the last girl, but at least it cuts the BS. I also wear my emotions on my sleeve, good or bad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Backstory**I met a awesome girl recently at a friends house. The only kicker was that her and her bf just broke up recently. I was getting the vibe the whole time we hung out, so I thought. A few weeks ago I got enough brave juice in me to ask her out, she said yes and the following weekend we hung out the whole time.

Knowing she's still fresh out, I acted my best and did not push at all. Ironically, this back fired as she made the move on me. We hooked up, things were great. I thought it was a amazing weekend, shared stories, similar upbringings, partied, laughed..everything.

So then a few weeks pass by, we talk on the phone briefly, was kinda awkward but didnt' think much. Then 2 days ago she asked me out, only to bail on me later. Today I get email saying she only wants to be friends. So with the info at hand, was I the "getting over my ex" booty call?

The only thing I can think of is that I might've given off more a relationship vibe than anything else. I did make her a mix cd, and a short story I wrote. I figured it was a worthy gamble. Also all this happened in NYC, a city unlike any other, where dating can be absolutely amazing or fucked. Often times in 1 week!
TL;DR Met a amazing girl that just broke up with her bf, I hook up with her although I didn't make the first move. Developed feelings, now she wants to be friends.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> A few weeks ago I met someone amazing (the white rhino), you know the kind where you can't stop thinking of them, that rare beauty you run into once every few years.  
We've hung out a few times, nothing serious, but I've been getting the good vibe overall.  She even informed me things weren't going well with her bf, and sounded as though things were going to end. (I didnt even ask her) Last time she even said, "I probably won't be talking to him" 
So last nite I finally summoned up the courage to ask her out. Although it didn't come out the smoothest, I still put it out there.  She responded, "I'm still with him..trying to work things out."  I asked how that was going, and all she said was "it's going"...Of course I tried to play it cool, and told her to let me know if anything changes.  
My question fellow Redditors.  I can handle the rejection, but was I missing some huge sign that I wasn't aware of.  Was this a flat out no, or do I still have a shot in the long term?

<TEXT> The backstory:  I recently met someone pretty amazing, we've hung out a few times so far, and my gut is telling me she likes me.  We went out last night, got pretty buzzed, danced alot.  I went home and ended up drunk texting her.  Nothing insane was written, but I did say I want to hear her story over dinner sometime.  I woke up today realizing what I did, immediately regretting it.  Sorta chickened out I feel like.  I feel like I might've killed any momentum, and she hasn't texted back a reply.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The backstory:  A good friend of mine passed away in Dec due to cardiac arrest, he had pulmonary hypertension.  (33 y.o)  Three years ago, he met the love of his life, until the dumb whore went to Costa Rica and cheated on him.  The bitch got pregnant as well.  When she came back, she moved out of his apt and out of his life.  Fast forward today:  My friend's facebook page is still up and running, (his parents decided to keep it) people like to leave messages, posts, pics etc.  

Out of nowhere, this girl comes out of the woodworks and starts posting.  Everyday it's something, "I miss your touch, smile..."  Yada yada yada...Attention starving whore

Bottom line it's pissing me off now.  Only a few of us knew she cheated on him, everyone else thinks she's some sweet gal.  Out of respect for his FB page, I'm not going to bust her out.  But I can send her a message.  I need input on this.  Call me out if I'm accused of being a troll.  

TL;DR:  A girl who cheated on my friend who passed away is leaving annoying Facebook posts on his page.  I can see thru her B.S.  What should I do?   </TEXT>
