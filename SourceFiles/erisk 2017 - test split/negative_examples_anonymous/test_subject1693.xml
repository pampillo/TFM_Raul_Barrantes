What  I did (and this works for my google chrome browser, not sure if it works for anything else) is install this thing called Hola! that helps me browse from other countries. I just tried it with the NPR website and it worked. But you should really count your blessings at least you have a chance to see Tame Impala live in Australia. Hope this helps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Listen to Title Fight's album Hyperview. It's alternative rock but it's almost minimalist. I would suggest it if you enjoy listening to music as an aural experience since they play around a lot with the acoustics of the thing and make it sound very ambient for an alternative record, which is interesting to say the least. It's as if the sound kind of surrounds you from all sides as opposed to just going in your ears laterally, if that makes sense. It's also a very cohesive album so if you hear it in one sitting you'll enjoy it even more. Or if you can wait until July then listen to Tame Impala's new album it's called Currents. Or if you can't wait listen to some of the songs on it that are already out. They're a wonderful mix of, well, you can't really pin Tame Impala into a genre they're just great. They're basically every 60's and 70's band you ever loved reimagined and reconstructed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My Bloody Valentine has not necessarily gotten better with age, but when you have a phenomenal record like Loveless coming out in 1991 and then 22 years later being able to put out M B V in 2013 with similar results really says something. It's really hard to top Loveless but M B V definitely makes me want to pull my hair out trying to choose between the two so that says something. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly you can't hate on Ariana Grade for her song Love Me Harder. It is a great pop song, especially the production. But while you're on The Zombies, Time of the Season is amazing. The Beatles' I'm Only Sleeping is great. Honestly my definition of pop is pretty fluid it kind of merges into indie if you're going into the 21st century, in which case I would recommend The Virgins' debut album. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you like indie check out The Virgins, they have some very catchy tunes. If you like 80's or 90's real alternative Teenage Fanclub is great (I Don't Know and Don't Look Back are my favorites). But if you want something more current check out Pity Sex they have an album called Feast of Love and a song on it called Drown Me Out. Also Title Fight have a song called Your Pain Is Mine should satisfy your cravings. Please let me know how it works out! </TEXT>

<TEXT> You make some good points, but again, if he hadn't done that stuff then he would be dead himself, so he was just making that choice so I think the ends justify the means. I'm no saying he's right, but there has to be some "relatability" to him because he was always put in the situation where he had to make that choice. As for shooting Mike, yes he was wrong in doing that because "he didn't have to". But Mike was willing to kill Walter just a few seasons ago on Gus' orders. I say if someone smites you on one cheek, smash them on the other. I'm not saying the guy was a saint, and after reading all your comments I would venture to change the title of the post to something a little less polarizing, but he didn't deserve everything that happened to him-- and Vince Gilligan always said that Breaking Bad takes place in a moral universe, one where everyone gets what they deserve. My heart broke when everyone he loved turned on him and his family betrayed him and he didn't deserve that because he was a victim. </TEXT>

<TEXT> LOL I think I will actually I'm excited for someone to prove me wrong. Not that I know I'm right, that's not what I meant. I just would like someone to convince me of their opinion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good point. Thanks for your reply all my friends are just jokingly calling me a sociopath. But, although I forgot the context of Mike's death, I have to say Mike, although likable, wasn't entirely innocent. He was prepared to kill Walter before so it's not like he didn't adhere to the self-preservation idea. He was always a liability and he could have ruined everything Walter worked for. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes most definitely I would. I would hang out with everyone who I know will be famous but keep a low profile for the most part. The Greek philosophers, Jesus, Shakespeare, etc. Then when the 20th century starts I can have my real fun and meet every cool musician. If I get bored then I'll just fake my own death. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't rank these but I would love to see them on the list. 
The Stooges (by the Stooges) was released in 1969. I love how Ron Ashton did so much with like three chords. The bass held its own while Ashton would masturbate for like five minutes and Iggy would sing the most ballad-y song ever. Everyone talks about Raw Power but they forget this album.
MBV (by My Bloody Valentine) was released in 2013 and sounds so peculiar and nice.
Innerspeaker (2010) by Tame Impala is so ethereal sounding and haunting you have to include it. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I don't think Walter White did anything wrong </TITLE>

<TEXT> I recently watched Breaking Bad and enjoyed it a lot. But the whole time I was thinking about how Walter did nothing wrong. Yes, he killed Jane and orchestrated Gail's murder, but I don't think he was wrong in doing that. Jane put him in a position where it was either her or him and his family. I don't lie to myself and pretend to be righteous, when given the choice, if someone put me in a position where it's them or me I will choose myself. As for Gail, Wlater didn't actually pull the trigger, it was Jesse (not that he was wrong either). Gail was a liability and you can't blame either Walt or Jesse for choosing themselves over someone else. You can't forge a connection with someone and pretend that you would sacrifice yourself over them.
I don't know, I've spoken to my friends and no one agrees with me but ultimately the gist of my argument is that we shouldn't lie to ourselves. If we're given the choice to either die or have someone else die, we will choose the other person. It's self-preservation and it's a natural instinct that we shouldn't hide from or be ashamed of.

Edit: when I said recently that was a bit of a stretch. It has been like a year since I watched it so I forgot about the whole killing Mike and poisoning Brock stuff, but I stand by my statement (albeit not as strongly as before). </TEXT>
