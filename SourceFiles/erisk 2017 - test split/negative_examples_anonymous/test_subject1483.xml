It would be a lot easier for the user to give the command and for the console to hear it. The camera in the kinect is still used of course to identify the person giving the commands.


It';s just a small thing that will make the experience a lot nicer. People wouldn't have to be shouting across their living room, instead they could speak into they're mic.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Edit: thanks for the downvotes guys. #progress.


So for people who use the Kinect, they know that when the TV is a bit too loud the Kinect cannot hear you, which is understandable.


My solution is simple and could be done with a software update. Allow Kinect to hear your commands via the headset.


I would make the Kinect user experience a lot more tolerable, as a lot of people enjoy blasting game volume to get immersed and not being able to use the Kinect properly when doing this can ruin a game if Kinect commands are allowed within the game.


It's a small thing I know but it's a small thing that will make the console feel a lot more responsive. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Xbox One Multi-screen Windows 10.? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-14 15:16:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For a long while now I've been wanting Xbox to make multi-screen a feature on it's console. [This latest image I've seen](https://i.imgur.com/HJ0QMju.jpg) makes me want it even more.

 nbsp;

Now I'm not sure about the capabilities of Windows 10 on Xbox One but is this something that could be done? Or is it more on the hardware side of things? Maybe an official Xbox multi-screen HDMI splitter?

 nbsp;

I'm just brainstorming ideas, but if anyone has any info on the matter it would be much appreciated.

 nbsp;

Edit: Damn. Thanks for the info guys! </TEXT>

If his story is true (which tbh is believable compared to other stories on the internet) then he got screwed over by bad/ negligent customer service and Gamestop should correct that.


But then again, that's just like my opinion I guess.

<TEXT> Black Flag is the only game I think they did right apart from the first 2. For me it is the one that looks most different to the other and therefor gives it a different feel. 


At the beginning of Assassins Creed I was really excited for the series. Imaging every game would be set in a completely different time period and country (i.e Egypt during the reigns of the Pharaohs, China during the Ming Dynasty, England during the Industrial Revolution, America during the Revolution etc etc) but every game from Assassins creed 1-3 felt the same. They took too long to realise the potential of the series.


Also on another note, wtf is up with Abstergo Entertainment?? I hope it really hasn't come to that, I hop I have to take them down in the end (Haven't finished the game yet). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok fine it's not the worst one made, yes I was being a touch dramatic but it was just really infuriating because it felt like a step backwards instead of forward. Now though since it wasn't included in the last game they are more likely to not have the option again in this game. Match customization was a big part of the game for my friends and I so I apologise but I fell quite strongly since the WWE games have been a part of my life since forever. </TEXT>

I though each game would be set in a different time period in different parts of the world, granted it technically was but they all felt the same. I was hoping for one in China during the Ming dynasty, another in Egypt during the time of the Ferros etc etc. Instead we got the crap that they spewed out Abstergo Entertainment **FUCK OFF** </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was re-watching the latest Top Gear season last night. It was the episode where they go to Australia and have to herd some cattle using their cars. The farm they were on was ***3.2million acres***. My "country" is 2.5 square miles (circa 1600 acres). You can fit my entire country 2000 times into that one single farm.


Australia is fucking massive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Those are the ones that are available right now for preview members. More will be added in the very near future once Xbox can strike a deal with developers. Aslong as developers say yes we should be seeing fully capabale backwards compatibility with all games in the very near future. But before any of this happens we need Windows 10 on Xbox.

Backwards compatibility will hopefully allow you to play any 360 game you own, natively on your Xbox one (provided that developers give Xbox their permission to use old games for free on the new system). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree the UI needs changing but that isn't the way to go about it. On console it would take you forever to get to your current gear as each tab take a second or 2 to load.


The best method would be drop down lists like they have on the bestiary, alchemy tabs etc. This way you can select the category you need without having to load everything else up on the way. It will give much easier access to your current equipment as you would only need to flick right once and you can add many categories without it looking like a cluster fuck. 


They were so close, yet so far. They had the idea just didn't implement it where needed.


Any ways that's my 2 cents. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not the same thing really. That was giving you extra in-game money, this is giving you exclusive weapons that deal more damage. You could make 1,000,000 in GTA in a couple of hours, you will never use these weapons unless you get the pre-order bonus. It will kill the pvp especially since it's at launch, a few players will have better gear form the start because of this bullshit.

Please don't give this game any more promotion. They are already trying to sell us exclusive DLC which gives paying players an edge in battle with extra weapons and equipment. We as a community have to stop promoting such bullshit practices by developers because if we don't no one will.

<TEXT> Not what you are asking but my most recent and surprising glitch was in Witcher 3. **SPOILERS AHEAD** It's when you are travelling through worlds with Avallach [Ciris elf friend, not sure how to pronounce his name] and come across the world with the deadly gas. If you manage to get down onto the lowest level [there are various ways of doing so] You can explore the world, there's nothing there but you can have a run around the ["titty mountains"](https://account.xbox.com/en-gb/screenshot/cd36820b-eed1-4b83-8067-3c73fe5d6465?gamertag=kiwi1990 scid=de360100-3ae5-4fd5-a7da-9d3d6b481c3d) as I like to call them.

Also my favourite was in World at War where you could go under the map on that tank map and kill everyone from below whilst guarding the glitch entrance with claymores etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just because something looks like it may be a threat does not give the officer the right to murder a civilian. The police have to completely change their manner of conduct to keep in par with the military style of policing that they seem to love so much. Before a single shot is fired you must confirm that the "enemy" is armed and dangerous. A good way of doing this would be making an officer confirm with his partner before opening fire. Instead of just thinking he's a gun totting bad ass sheriff saving the town. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I've been a PC gamer for 5 years now, in that time I've gone through 3000 worth of hardware. Why? It's my hobby, I like doing it. Do you need a 3000 PC to play games? No. No you don't.

 nbsp;

And this is exactly what I mean, you will end up wasting more money than if you had bought a console. Yes I know he claims it is his hobby **but** that is exactly what it becomes for everyone and that my friend is where the money goes, you will end up upgrading parts and spending a lot of money.

<TEXT> I agree about the prices for games and subscriptions, they can be a bit outlandish but I'm happy to pay it if it makes gaming a simple and enjoyable experience. Also don't get me wrong either I have nothing against PC gaming, to each his own. What gets me is when people claim PC gaming to be cheaper than console (strictly talking about the rig). I paid 350 for my console and that will last me for the next 5 years or so. I highly doubt you can build a PC for that price which will play all the games that come out in the near future without having to upgrade a few components. I just don't see how it can be cheaper apart from game deals and subscriptions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Buy the time I have to buy my next console you would have spent the same amount on parts on your PC. PC gamers are constantly swapping out parts because the next game they play requires a better graphics card or more RAM etc etc. Don't get me wrong I have nothing against PC gaming, I just don't like it when people argue that it is cheaper than a console because at the end of the day it really isn't. You could future proff your PC at fit in top of the range parts and then yes it would last a very long time without needing an upgrade but for that price (around 1500-2000) you could buy the next 3-4 generations of consoles. </TEXT>

I have searched everywhere, been doing so for a good while now but no luck in finding the god damn key.

 nbsp;

It is the chest in the room with the door [The only room with a door in the entire elven ruins] and also had two ghosts protecting it, but none had the key. Does anybody know where this key is?? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey OP I have an idea for the inventory if you would like to add it in. Drop Down lists like used in the Bestiary and Alchemy tabs. They could still keep the same format as now (i.e weapons and armour, usable items etc) but just add subsections (i.e Oils, bombs, potions etc). That's my two cents, nice list hope they see it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok so I have a treasure hunt which you receive in White Orchard. I never read the letter as I was new to the game and had no idea what I was doing. Now I'm nearing the end and have this treasure quest I cannot complete because I must first read a letter I found at the beginning of the game which I sold not knowing it was important and ofc I have no idea who I sold it too. So yea just keep them, they weigh 0.01 so there is not point in getting rid of them. Hopefully the will update the inventory menu and make a separate section for notes   books. </TEXT>

Unless we can convince our respected towns to change the names of the street our neighbourhoods are on to Crimson street. Then we can both fight crime in Crimson Street but none of us will have to move. but first lets have that cake...it's a crimson cake.

<TEXT> Firstly, welcome back!! now onto the matter at hand.


Games: I don't know what type of games you like but I suggest Witcher 3 [obviously] and Dying light. With those two games you have a solid month of gaming ahead of you. Also Sunset Overdrive if you like the outlandish type of games. EA Access is also a really good idea to get, 20 a year and you have access to all the games in the vault (currently includes FIFA 15, NFL 15, NHL 15, NBA Live 15, BF4, Plants V Zombies and a few others) plus 10% discount on all EA digital purchases.


Accessories:Adapter for headset if your using a third party headset, plug and play kit **and** thumb grip for the analogues (I cannot stress enough how much better this makes the controller).


Happy gaming! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow. Getting downvoted because of a joke comment, lighten up assholes!!

 nbsp;

Edit: Forgot to answer your question. No I have not read the books, but that has nothing to do with what I said. I'm not arguing the fact that Geralt is an established character with a lot of history. What I'm saying is the way I play with Geralt is different. Am I not allowed to play the way I wish to play? Because I'm pretty sure that this is the reason for the game being multiple choice with many different outcomes, so that the player can play the way he/she desires. </TEXT>

Still a few levels away from being able to even attempted that quest though. </TEXT>

My map looks too bare especially Novigrad the biggest city in the game has one blacksmith showing in the whole of it, which to top off, is Hattori who is unusable unless you do his sidequest at level 20 something. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No but sometimes yes. You can play it without a problem but it does reference the history of the series a bit. Do as I did, play a bit and get a feel for what's going on in the current game and then go back and watch some youtube vids or read up a bit on it and you will get the full picture in no time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, I admit when I'm wrong. You can build a PC for the same price as a console. But let's be honest here, who would actually want to play with it? Who would not fork out the extra cash to upgrade a few components? And there lies the problem with PC gaming, it is a never ending hole which you keep chucking your money into. I buy my console once, and for the entirety of that consoles life I will be able to play all the games they release for it, you won't. At some point a game will be released where you need certain amount of RAM or w/e and you will have to buy it on top of the game you are buying it for. I just don't see it worth the time and money just to play with better graphics and mods. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Or buy a PC which for every new game that comes out you need some new component to run it because you have the wrong graphics card or not enough RAM to run that particular game.

<TEXT> A PC will set you back a lot more than a console. no matter what anyone says it's just not true that gaming PC is cheaper than a console. Yes you could build a gaming PC on the cheap but you will be on the lower end of performance and will eventually end up buying more and more components to upgrade your PC to handle the next game that comes out. Where as a console will run any game for the reminder of it's life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If I could single handedly kill mobile gaming I wouldn't even hesitate to do so. You guys do not understand how much a loathe mobile fucking gaming. The reason being my god damn friends.


Every fucking chance they get they are glued to their fucking screens playing some new and normally retarded game in which all you do is tap or swipe, currently it's MK X. The reason I hate it so much is because it is non-stop, literally any second they have they will be on their phones ignoring every one around them. The worst part is when we are in my house playing xbox, when it's not their turn to play instead of watching the others play and provide some conversation they will bring out their fucking phones to play those stupid fucking games whilst waiting to play another game. It's fucking sickening and I'm really raging against mobile games atm so much that a lot of what I've said doesn't even makes sense. **RAGEEEEEEE** I wish I could punch the creator of candy saga in the face, that bitch/bastard started it all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never heard of Witcher until this game and no I don't think it's necessary to play the game. So far I have understood a lot about what's going on. What I suggest you do is read the little booklet that comes with the game. It gives you some decent backstory. The only problem I've encountered so far is a part of dialogue which I had to recall what I did in certain events in the prior games, I just winged it. </TEXT>

On another note never use a trimmer near your shaft!! I made the horrible mistake once of using a trimmer for my ballsack and I ventured to far up, the guard was on but that was no help. The trimmer caught and sliced a bit of skin under my shaft. I was too ashamed to go to hospital or anything so I put a plaster on it and it eventually closed. That was a really worrying week. </TEXT>

<TEXT> although I agree with the notion of letting people do what they wany the whole don't pre order "campaign" on Reddit atm is to try and get people opinions to change, it's not an order but a suggestion. If we keep pre-ordering and companies realise this all they will do is cram amazing trailers and rumours down our throats in order to get all our pre-orders then they really don't have to do much more. They can produce a mediocre game and still make bank. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The build up to the finale was pretty intense, the run through the sewers in particular had my heart racing. The climb up to the tower was also pretty good and tbh the QTE wouldn't have bothered me that much **if** it weren't the only bit of fighting in the finale. A nice trap room full of zombies that you had to clear to get to Raiz would've been a lot more entertaining and would've made the final QTE tolerable. I'm not not mad, I'm just slightly disappointed that there wasn't one last final "fuck yea moment" when you finish clearing the room of zombies and stop to admire your work. </TEXT>

But in all seriousness though IMO modding isn't really gaming and that is why I don't believe it belongs here. Modders could create a sub and have a modding community on Reddit to help each other with mods and show off their work instead of this current circle jerk (that rhyme was free, then next one I'm charging). Also to replay to the actual point you made the answer is simple, the game was new back then...1 and half years ago. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When you left things took a turn for the worse. Mother didn't look at dad the same way for not being able to find you, their marriage got rocky quickly. She started having an affair with our neighbour Mr.Bonobo and sadly contracted AID's. She tried to hide it from dad but he found out eventually like he always does. When dad found out he couldn't take it and he left us a note telling us he is going to take a long walk...into the enchanted lake in hope he could join his lost son once more. I told mum that dad had moved out of town to spare her because her AIDs had gotten really bad and this would've just pushed her over the edge. Unfortunately she lost her battle soon after and I was left all alone at the age of 9. No food, or money I did what I had to do to survive, I sold my colours to any one who would take them, how I miss them. They were the only thing keeping me going but survival was more important than living at that point in my life so they had to go. a few years of begging on the streets later I finally landed my first real job in a McKFC, the pay wasn't great but I finally had warm food daily. Slowly but surely I made my way up the ladder and I am now based in the Headquaters on a farm in Kentucky. I have a wife and 2 kids of my own now and I'm finally in place where I fell good about my life. Until you showed yourself all these years later and reminded me of the past suffering you caused you selfish son of a bitch. I'll be seeing you soon....very soon. </TEXT>

Then when they react, as they always do, you guys seem surprised. I'm not saying do not do it out of fear, I'm saying do not do it out of respect.

<TEXT> Meh, once I found out this was going to be AR and not VR I lost all interest. Don't get me wrong it's an amazing piece of technology but let's stop fooling ourselves into thinking this is made for gaming, because it's not. Gaming is one of the last things this thing will be used for and it's a real shame they didn't focus on VR instead. Imagine playing GTA V or Dying Light with VR. As the article says it one of the games it is focused on is Minecraft, a game played by kids who obviously don't have money to buy this thing. I don't know it just feels like they are telling us what we need instead of providing us with what we want. </TEXT>

I was screaming at my TV for him to throw a left but unfortunately it didn't seem like he heard me. The few times he did throw a straight left instead of jabbing with the right first he would get Mayweather unprepared. It was frustrating to watch because the match was there for him to win but he lacked aggression and pressure. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> SO I decided to try my hands at installing the ROM myself with a lot of help from the internet but unfortunately I have come up short.

 nbsp;

These were the steps I followed:


-Root the phone


-install custom recovery system


-install ROM + GApps + SuperSu + Camera Fix

 nbsp;

At the moment I believe I have successfully rooted my phone using Odin and the CF auto root file.


The next step was to install a custom recovery system. Which according to Odin was installed successfully.


Now I have to get my phone into custom recovery mode to install the ROM and other files but this is where the problem lays. Everytime I attempt to get into recovery mode it skips it and goes to download mode instead. 


I've been nearly an hour now trying to get into recovery mode with no success. Please help!!! 

 nbsp;

**Update 1**: Ok so I flashed a new recovery system and I am now using Clockworkmod. I wipe all the caches etc and then go to install the ROM, it installs in seconds [which isn't very promising] and then gets stuck on a black screen with slightly animated piece of text saying "android" and then nothing happens. 


My phone is a Samsung Galaxy s3 Neo i9300i. I've tried various ROMs now, does anybody have experience installing a version that works on this model if so could you provide a link?? 


Also I technically have no phone at the moment so if I could get some answers that would be great!!

<TITLE> Essentials for buying a Wii U </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-22 21:00:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I finally got bored of my Xbone [until halo 5 releases] so for the meantime I thought I would get myself a Wii U.


Here are the things I'm getting: Wii U Mario Kart 8 Bundle, Smash Bros, Wii U Pro Controller and a Wii Mote.


Is there something I'm missing or am I good with that? Any other games or accessories you guys would recommend??




edit: Thanks guys for all the suggestions!!


Heres my final verdict: 



Battery pack sounded like a good idea but I have a mains outlet right by my sofa so its not a real necessity. 



Deffo going for the screen protector [better safe than sorry]



Mario 3d world seems like a must



Bayonetta 2 and some other games mentioned eg Monster Hunter etc sound like fun but the reason I'm buying the Wii U is more for local multiplayer so I'm going to give those a skip, for now.



Gonna try out that virtual Console thing



I'm sticking with my current controller set-up, only because this way I will have one of each type.

On the network connections page there is now only the bluetoith connection and ethernet. Ive tried to the best of my ability to set up a Wifi but I cannot crack it.


I then located the broadcom folder and found the driver installer but it will not run. After the first step it message appears saying "wizard was unable to find any drivers for this machine".

<TEXT> Hi Guys,

Im wanting to set up game sharing with a good friend of mine and I just want to make sure I have all the correct info before we start the set up.



We both want to have each others games on each of our consoles. So my guess is we would have to put his account on mine and set it up as my home xbox and then do the same on his xbox but with my account.


Is this correct?? I  know it sounds like a stupid straight forward process but I just want to be 100% sure that this is the correct way to do it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reddit is a community full of weird and wonderful people, unicorns and others, and i'm guessing many of you out there have weird and wonderful Christmas Traditions.

My tradition is watching Nightmare Before Christmas on Christmas Eve.

What have you got reddit??

Edit: MERRY CHRISTMAS!!

<TEXT> ..and today we all receive this amazingly worded e-mail from one of our work colleagues. It had me in stitches, hope you enjoy!!

"On visiting Jason's cake this morning  to help myself to a piece, I was  aghast though probably not surprised that one of our number had  helped themselves to all of the pieces of Flake that were, as of yesterday, generously decorating the top of it. 

I was left with a sadness not only at the loss of the flake but on consideration,  that one of my erstwhile colleagues could have done such a thing 

On further reflection I think perhaps we should dedicate one of our CPD sessions to Professional ethics with a particular emphasis on birthday cakes

<TEXT> ..Staring aimlessly at reddit and clicking every link on the page as one does on a Friday when there is not much work to do when all of a sudden I catch myself staring at a pair of immaculate busty titties. You are probably thinking to yourself "and how is that a fuck up? you've just seen titties"...well unfortunately for me the only woman who works in the office (who also happens to be my manager) was standing within eye shot (trying out a new phrase there). Needless to say she wasn't amused, I have to go see her at the end of the day. Not the best way to start off your weekend :(

TDLR; got caught looking at NSFW posts at work by manager who is the only woman in the office...i think I'm screwed


these are the titties in question, please do not open at work...learn from my mistake!!..


update: link got removed due to violations
update: I thank America for inventing the 3 strike system. I still have a job but a strike against me and a manager who thinks im a perv...got off lightly tbh :)

<TEXT> This is not really a new topic or something I have discovered, we all know about this and how it's getting progressively worse. More and more game developers jump on this money making bandwagon and we "the consumer" are left with a bigger hole in our wallet with each new game release. In most cases we end up paying for the game twice in order to have the complete version. I am just getting sick of it and it is starting to put me off gaming. I know a lot of people will tell me "well you moron just don't buy the Season Pass. You don't need it to play the game". I know i do not need it, but i want to enjoy every aspect that the game has to offer, which is something i do on all of my games. I do not like leaving a collectible uncollected, a map not being fully explored, a power not gained I want to see the whole game, the game i paid for when i went to the shops and bought it. Being a gamer is just getting increasingly more expensive with every year that passes and tbh i do not know how much longer many people, including myself, will be able to fund this hobby. 

Do you feel the same? Do you differ? Any ideas of what we as a gaming community can do to raise this point with game developers? C'mon Reddit lets pull together on this one! </TEXT>

<TITLE> A Gay Man join the Navy </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> ...and has just set off on his first tour. Whilst travelling across the Atlantic just hours after setting off, he starts to panic at the thought of what were to happen if the ship were to sink. Walking around the ship with a worried look on his face he passes by a captain. The captain can see that the new recruit is worried and asks;

Captain: What is wrong recruit?

The Private looks at him and asks:

Gay Private: What happens if the ship sinks??

The Captain smiles and replies

Captain: Not to worry, we would send out a distress call and the US Navy and Coastguard will come to assist us. Now get back to your duties.

The private seems relieved by this answer thanks the captain and continues on with his duties.

The following day they are quite a bit further out to sea and have reached international waters. The private is having lunch when he realizes he cannot see any land in sight, this gets him panicking again. Luckily for him he stumbles upon the same Captain and asks him;

Gay Private: Captain please tell me again what happens if the ship would sink.

Captain: Again? Ok then...well this time seeing as we are in international water we would send out an 
international distress call and the closet vessel to us would come and assist.

The recruit, again happy with the reply from the captain, continues having lunch worry free.

The following day they are finally nearing enemy territory and activity on ship is getting to a high in preparation for entry into the territory. All this hustle and movement on the ship is making the gay private nervous again. He starts searching the ship for the captain so that the captain can reassure him again. 

He finally finds the captain who is extremely busy with preparations and slowly approaches him. 

Gay Private: Captain?

No reply

Gay Private: Captain!? 

He says a little louder, yet no reply.

Gay Private: CAPTAIN!!!!!!

Captain: WHAT!?!?! WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT CANT YOU SEE I AM BUSY??? WE ARE ENTERING ENEMY TERRITORY!!

Gay private: thats what I wanted to ask...

He says hesitantly

Gay private: ...what would happen if we were to sink now?

The Captain, frustrated by this point with everything that is going on around him and the fact that this is the third time he has asked and shouts back at the private

Captain: WELL WE WILL BE FUCKED UP THE ASS WOULDNT WE!!!!!?!?!!?

The Gay private blushes, smiles and replies..

Gay private: I cant wait!!

The father replies "oh, it's just a saying son... like when some one is caught stealing, we say they have been caught red handed, even though their hands are actually black."
