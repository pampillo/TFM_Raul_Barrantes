<TEXT> I love this. Reminds me of the JFK quote about being a liberal. 

"If by a "Liberal" they mean someone who looks ahead and not behind, someone who welcomes new ideas without rigid reactions, someone who cares about the welfare of the people-their health, their housing, their schools, their jobs, their civil rights and their civil liberties-someone who believes we can break through the stalemate and suspicions that grip us in our policies abroad, if that is what they mean by a "Liberal", then I'm proud to say I'm a "Liberal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> this is a little excessive, but I think the point that u/MrFactualReality is trying to make is that Bernie has stood by his policies for his entire career. He marched on Washington with MLK, he has fought for LGBT rights since the seventies, he was/is against the Iraq War, he is against TPP. Sanders stands by his views and does not flip-flop. I think Hillary with TPP is what definitely sold me on Bernie, she took awhile to respond to it (and still has not?), while Bernie came out against it since the whole debate started. I also see her more as a moderate than Bernie, which is why Bernie appeals to me more, as I am more of a progressive. One last point, the whole 2 billion dollar fundraising goal by Hillary is not something I am a fan of. I think these are the points that u/MrFactualReality was trying to make, but was taking a much more rash stance against her. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with this claim, from personal experience. I could not go to my top school I wanted to due to cost. The school I wanted to go to was higher ranked and had tougher admission standards than the school I am attending now. Yes I was still able to go a university, but the cost was why I chose a university with lower admission standards and a lower academic rating. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am probably going to buy a few things from the store in the next few days, probably a shirt and few buttons, I was curious about shipping times? I have seen that people on here having been posting that it has taken 4+ weeks and I go back to college in a little over a month and was curious if it was still taking that long so I could know where to ship my order to (my college address or home address) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember in season one Marty had the horns above his head in the poster, and I looked back on the promotional posters from season 2 and found this.

The crow in the middle of the road has to be a reference to the Birdman, right?

Edit 1: By Birdman I mean the bird mask that has been shown/worn in both episodes of season 2. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bernie a few days ago on NPR (these quotes are taken from an article written on The Hill):

 Talking about cultural divides in this country, you know, it is important for people in urban America to understand that families go out together and kids go out with their parents and they hunt and they enjoy the outdoors and that is a lifestyle that should not be condemned...if anyone thinks that gun control itself is going to solve the problem of violence in this country, you're terribly mistaken...so, obviously, we need strong, sensible gun control and I will support it. But some people think it's going to solve all of our problems. It is not."
