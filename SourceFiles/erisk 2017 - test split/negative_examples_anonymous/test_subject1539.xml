<TEXT> Cheers for that, though it's a directive to improve:

conditional upon the ability of the member state to demonstrate that the non-charging for water services does not compromise the purposes and objectives of the Directive

Or to put it another way, we don't have to charge if we can fix it otherwise.

We're not **obliged** to impose charges, we're obliged to impose **changes**.

'Technically correct' it may be, but nevertheless we are still not obliged to charge for domestic water.

We are certainly not obliged to spend over ~1 billions in Euros putting in meters rather than repairs. </TEXT>

There's a ruling due in [April](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/what-is-the-eu-test-on-irish-water-about-1.2010287) and if Irish Water doesn't pass it - then all Irish Water's spending goes back on the government balance sheet.

This injection of investment might have a role there. </TEXT>

Our constitution separates the powers of politics and the powers of policing from each other.

<TEXT> This lad is a clown.

I will selectively target his on-record statements as a demonstration of his clownhood, though there are many more and selectivity isn't really necessary:

["People are very apprehensive after six years of hardship. They are tired of charges and **that mood is being exploited by the same people who gave you the anti-bin charges protests**, Rabbitte said. And **remember where the anti-bin charges protests led to   it led the privatisation of the bin services** and it led to people not being able to pay.](http://www.thejournal.ie/irish-water-pat-rabbitte-1754730-Oct2014/)

The privatisation of bin charges (this was in Dublin) were due to the use of a veto by the then chair of Dublin City Council.

That chair was held by [John Tierney](http://www.broadsheet.ie/2014/01/21/ever-bin-had/)

If the name rings a bell, it's because he is now of charge of Irish Water.

So according to Pat don't protest Irish Water because that might precipitate privatisation and the guy who did that to the bins is now in charge of Irish Water. Hardly the argument of someone who knows what he's talking about.

<TEXT> Ok, just to dispel some of the "that's bullshit" ideas - hypnotism does actually work.

It cannot make you do things very outside your moral range, e.g. murder, though it can make you do things that you'd consider doing if you were drunk for instance.

It induces a very relaxed state of mind, if you refuse a suggestion then that relaxed state is broken and you're back to normal. Hence, people often follow the suggestions to keep the relaxed state. That's the ELI5 of it.

As to, 'should I partake in stage hypnosis' - no you shouldn't.

It's often very embarrassing after the fact, can cause major sleep pattern disturbance and is best left to people who are qualified in it and have a medical professional reputation to lose if they screw up.

There are many anecdotal and some serious investigations into bad outcomes days afterwards in otherwise healthy people.

As a technical definition, falling asleep can be considered self-hypnosis.

Don't let someone (unqualified) mess around with something essential to your brain's healthy routines.

If only this were surprising.

It makes 11 recommendations to the Government and has asked it to report in 18 months on the steps it has taken to implement the recommendations.

So a problem for the next government, and probably not a problem at all - as it won't be acted on.

<TEXT> I really want to try one of these, but having an 'appointment' window to do so seems either bull-headed or even a little suspicious.

Are they nervous of selling all their stock too quickly, running up a production line only to be left with unsold stock, being exposed as a sub-par device, or do people have to be 'current' enough to know how to get them   thus create some kind of artificial 'cachet' for them?

I reckon the way to sell these needs to be a bit more like an R-Pi or Odroid.

Sure they're kind of niche for a while then let them grow via their communities.

Not gate the opportunity to simply try them. I really want a genuine Linux phone to succeed - just let me buy one when I've the cash. Don't tell me when to have the cash ready. </TEXT>

I'll see what they're like closer to the time, as well as keep an eye out for the chancers running as 'Independent FF, FG or L' - that one really winds me up.

Which reminds me, I'm going to see if I can get people interested in banning those stupid posters from the town at the weekend. I think it should be one board in the town and one poster per candidate on that. It's 2015, they can use the web and / or canvassing.

<TEXT> Good for them.

I don't think that was the case during this debate though:

["The report stage began at 11.50am on 10 July, and was adjourned at 5am the following morning. At about 2.40am, as deputies were awaiting a division, Tom Barry pulled ine Collins, a fellow Fine Gael TD for Cork East, onto his lap."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_of_Life_During_Pregnancy_Act_2013#D.C3.A1il_stages).

So either the vast majority of the drinks that night were ordered between 5am   5.30am, or those 331 drinks were spread through the Dil's working hours.

I've little to no time for people who drink on the job. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great idea!

The 'Lapgate' [tally](http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/lapgate-fails-to-call-time-on-dail-bar-drinks-254568.html):

The Members Bar can stay open for up to an hour after the Dil has finished its proceedings, and on the night of Lapgate **served until 5.30am** as the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill was discussed and voted upon by TDs.

Takings in the Members Bar  exclusively reserved for TDs and senators  for that all night session amounted to 1,440.80.

Till receipts showed that 331 alcoholic drinks were downed by Oireachtas members during the session.

These included 105 pints of lager at a cost of 493.50, 74 pints of Guinness, totalling 318.20, 22 pints of Smithwicks costing 94.60, and 31 quarter bottles of wine amounting to 170.50.

Thirsty TDs and senators also knocked-back 31 bottles of beer at a cost of 145.70, and forked out 118.90 for 29 glasses of gin and vodka, and 85 for 17 brandies.

The adjacent Visitors Bar, where TDs and senators often entertain guests, and other Oireachtas staff and accredited media drink, also had a roaring trade that night, taking in 3,572.

<TEXT> The Catholic Church has plenty of money. If they didn't you'd think that over the last 13 years they would have asked the Vatican for a loan. It's not remotely broke. The Vatican Bank had ["a net profit of 87 million in 2012"](http://www.theexpgroup.com/blog/success-blog/vatican-bank-publishes-first-set-accounts/) on assets of 5 billions.

I think they're just running out of road, the part-true / part stalling-tactic of claiming complicated ownership structures has bit them on the ass. Now they'll have to sell more of what they can sell and they'll still be short.

Anyway, the church is extremely fortunate to have been giving such an easy time of it. It's not like they deserve it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Article 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights 

states:

Men and women of marriageable age have the right to marry and to found a family, according to the national laws governing the exercise of this right.

That is not an attempt to define Marriage. It is stating the right of Men   Women to marry.

Nowhere does it state a limitation on what gay marriage can be, should be or is.

All you've done here is state that the ECHR has nothing to say about gay marriage.

Please remember nuance while you are advocating a two-tier citizenship for Irish citizens in Ireland based on sexuality.

<TEXT> Well, we don't have to wonder. We can just look at the UK which has a few decades of privatisation, and let that guide us:

["The universal experience of water privatisation in the UK was a sharp increase in the cost of water. On average, prices rose by over 50% in the first 4 years. The first 9 years produced an increase of 46% in real terms, adjusted for inflation. The details are shown in the table below."](http://www.psiru.org/reports/uk-water-privatisation-%E2%80%93-briefing)

Plenty of data   review on that site, worth a look.

The TL;DR is that privatisation has not improved efficiency, has not brought prices down (the reverse happened) and that infrastructure improvements never materialised or were quite delayed and of poor quality. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I use an Odroid U3 as a desktop and it's great! Works for days   days, isn't crazy slow or super fast. More than capable as a desktop replacement. I've been using one for ~6 months. I use another as XBMC + TV Computer.

The C1, on the other hand, I can't imagine is quite the same. It's considered ~30% less powerful. I haven't got one yet though, so I can't tell you for sure.

Though for casual surfing (no flash video) and simple office tasks I'd say it would be very good value, just not super fast. 

Using an eMMC rather than an SD card is essential for good speeds on either.

This would bump the price up a bit, ~30 for an 8gb eMMC.

I'd place the C1 as a good way to turn a 'dumb' TV into a Smart TV, but not for everyday office use. The U3 is fantastic as both, I can tell you that from experience. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Enda Kenny has denied that his Fine Gael colleague had any role in shutting down a Dil debate on alleged Garda malpractice last week

This reminds me of the McNulty appointment fiasco, where 'nothing untoward' happened - only to be followed a week or so later with 'the appointment fell below our usual standards' and 'unnamed FG officials' causing the problems.

Whatever about Shatter's involvement, I wonder if Enda is on record denying that **he** had any role in shutting down the debate?

edit:

The letters are [here (pdf)](http://www.merrionstreet.ie/en/ImageLibrary/20150103OHigginsInquiryDocuments.pdf), and the journal has a summary [here](http://www.thejournal.ie/enda-kenny-alan-shatter-letters-1918378-Feb2015/)

There's plenty to read, though during a quick look I saw this from an Alan Shatter letter pg 25 of 33 - "it is my view that the rule of law and the constitutional principle of the separation of powers should be upheld and respected".

I still think that via Brian Purcell either Alan Shatter or Enda (perhaps both) got Callinan to resign. We should ask all involved. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In fairness to my pal, she was correct.

The exchange is one of the earliest ones enabled, the lines clearly running across the road to the exchange and were dug up enough times too. It's Eircom's responsibility to ensure the d2ds know the locale.

On a personal level, I'm with Digiweb and my neighbour's with Eircom. The only difference in our lines is where they split at the two houses. I get my fibre upgrade in 6 days all done, and no drops. My neighbour waits 6 weeks, and it takes 3 months to get a stable connection.

I reckon Eircom's problems are fairly ingrained at this stage. Though in fairness, I think they're also in a bad position - responsible for almost the entire infrastructure and trying to be a regular telecom company at the same time, with plenty of ethos / staff left over from its public utility days. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know for sure.

There's as much concern as to patents, seed ownership, cross-breeding rights, corporate monopolies on essentials etc. as there is to GMOs themselves.

As for the genetic modification side, I'm inclined to think they're safe.

Though then I remember about 15 years ago, a group scientists declared sections of our DNA 'junk' that had built up over the aeons of evolution. This became a widely held viewpoint, but then about 5 years later - the view changed to the 'junk' being part of epigenetic transmission from one generation to the next. So very much not 'junk'.

That all made me think that genetic modification is perhaps still to young a scientific endeavour for anyone to say for sure at this stage.

Plus, I think it's often a solution looking for a problem.

We produce more food than we need, we bin so much of it, we use land inefficiently - all the while there are many techniques for growing plants in hostile environments, soil remediation, the city farm in Japan that's producing huge quantities of food with drastically lower water requirements. All these things without a GMO in sight, and thus none of the legal ownerships concerns.

I think the medical / environmental concerns can take a back-seat to the reality that we really don't need them.

Replace your "not broken" apt-gets with our internet-dependent breakables, special low-price today prior to the awkward climb-down later.

Mr Varadkar also insists that Ireland's health service is not "third world". He said such descriptions are because there is a "confidence problem" in the minds of the public.

The highest number of patients on trolleys only just a couple of weeks ago, a nurse's strike - all a confidence problem?

<TEXT> Very viable :)

I use a Pi as my main stereo, hidden away inside an old radio cabinet.

I use [Rune Audio](http://www.runeaudio.com/forum/) as MPD server, plus it comes with a nice UI for control from phones, tablets, pcs ...

Two things to note though:

The sound from the Pi is not great unless you add a DAC (it's really hissy without it) so I don't consider a DAC optional for this kind of setup. I went with a [Wolfson Audio DAC](http://www.element14.com/community/community/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-accessories/wolfson_pi), it's designed for the Pi and Rune Audio has built-in settings for it.

The other thing is large collections. I had a much easier time after splittling my collection into folders of just less than 10,000 songs each. Scanning, and quick playback was much better then.

The sound is glorious   clear. And for the price, I reckon impossible to beat.

What galls me is that while government wants more   finer grained data on citizens - the same government wants less   lower quality information known about it.

This is a pity as it would greatly assist citizens with sanctioning under-performers, removing government waste, evaluation and of course making informed decisions when voting.

<TEXT> I think out of any group, anywhere - there will always be those willing   wanting to go to extremes.

That only ~25 people have left Ireland to fight in Syria, or 0.07% of muslims in Ireland have done so - fits that idea.

It would be great that that tiny group didn't, but I don't think making policies for such outliers / edge cases is ever going to stop something which is part   parcel of human nature. However much we wish it weren't.

Plus, the very good news is that 99.93% do not.

<TEXT> Steam will get a big boost, showing off their steam machines and controllers over the year.

Console-only gamers will be very tempted to cross over after a mediocre and limited 2014, seeking the greater variety of games available via Steam, GOG etc.

Ubisoft will learn nothing, as they don't have to, their games sell anyway.

Though 2015 will probably be a bumper year for second-hand sales, as the lemons of 2014 get dumped into the stores by the end of this month.

By the end of 2015, Ubisoft will finally be in trouble for their QA issues after the Division sells next to no DLC. At least one of their divisions will be fully closed.

Nevertheless, 2015 will be much less salty. Adventure games will grow in popularity and books will become more of a primary source than movies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's not much I can help you with there, sorry.

Though, just on the simple process side of things:

I had it enabled on both pi's but when adding sources there is nothing under the UPnP option.

There should be nothing at that point, not directory type lists or files.

For the 'just in case' , repeat the step till you get to that same point and then press 'left' on the remote or 'c' if you've a keyboard and if a dialog box appears then press 'enter' / 'ok' / 'select' / 'scan for content' or click your mouse.

I know it sounds simple, but it's how some of the menu actions work.

From a technical standpoint, what you're looking for is the norm for me and most of my friends - it's very doable.

Also, I use the 'quartz' skin - so if you haven't changed them yet, I'd swap over to that for the Pi, it's light   quick. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Were you able to connect to 'UPnP (Auto Discover)' using add sources?

It comes up when you choose UPnP at the add sources stage but don't choose anything after - just it, and then it will be listed as a source. Click on that and any UPnP will show up, you should be able to connect from there. Both R-Pi's will need the 'connect via UPnP' and similar options ticked, of course.

Anyway, that's only one method. Plus UPnP won't get you posters, plotlines and other metadata - network shares will.

The better methods would be using SAMBA or NFS network shares. First way to do that is possibly your home router, if it's reasonably new it should have a NAS or 'File Sharing' option. Enable that on the router, plug the hard-drive into it and then back to your Pi. This time you'll be adding sources via the 'Windows Network (Samba)' or 'Network Share (NFS)' option and if the router's done it's job, you'll find all your folders in there and select them as you would in the same way as if it was a connected hard-drive.

If the router can't help you there, then you'd need a home-server. So that's typically an unused PC / laptop, or something like the Pi (though usually not super fast enough) or Odroid U3, it's not a massive piece of work - but a bit longer than a reddit comment. There are loads of guides online, but the quickest solution is with your router if it has such a function. So try that first. </TEXT>

The best way to learn is to have actual conversations, so you've got to stick to speaking French and only ever use English when you can't explain it with any other French you know.

Any HDMI port will do.

At home, I've a home server so all the files come across via NFS.

Plus, it's CEC compatible so if I'm just using XBMC then I use the TV remote.

To think last year I was only using a Pi with a HD plugged in directly for my XBMC needs. Now I'm all home-servered up with a completely silent set-up (before the Pi it was a PS3, so the drop in noise levels is much appreciated).

I look back at how I used to do things wondering what kind of digital savage I was back then ;)

The odroid really helped me step up my game.

<TEXT> Not precisely the Pi OS versions, the Odroid chips are different. So you wouldn't be able to flash a Pi OS on an Odroid.

There are loads of OSs to choose from though, even Android if you feel like it - have a look:

http://www.odroid.in/

I've both some R-Pi and odroids, I use the Pi for XBMC, security cams, web radios and I use the odroids for all of those things plus home server, desktop computer and general workhorse.

There's DOSBOX, of course Android games and a whole bunch of other ways to emulate. July's Odroid magazine has more details:

http://magazine.odroid.com/

I love both machines, but certainly the odroid U3 is more useful and I imagine the C1 will really give the Pi a run for it's money.

I don't need one, but I'll have to get one to see how it compares to the Pi. If it's like the U3, then I doubt I'll go back to the Pi for much. </TEXT>

I definitely recommend getting an eMMC though - they're really fast. All the images on the site will fit on the 8gb eMMC, so you don't have to go for the bigger and more expensive ones. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm over 6 months with it as a desktop, and I love it!

I don't need to stray past Libre Office for my admin stuff (work for myself), all the linux end is a breeze unsurprisingly and it's all really zippy at it.

I do find Chromium better than Firefox but otherwise I can't see much of a compelling difference from the X86s I have and which I'm using less.

I love bringing a little cigarette box size pc, wireless keyboard, HDMI and power-supply around instead of a laptop. I can grab it all in one hand and people are amazed that such a little thing can do so much (though they probably don't realise that their smartphone is much the same thing).

Standard programs open quickly and work well, they need customisation as does much in Libre Office and some GNU apps in general but no deal breakers so far. It's a joy to simply clone a working system and install it for people.

I'm not a database guru by any means, so I'm not going to speak for that. Though if bulk converting XHTML is anything to go by, the U3 is no slouch.

The devices can take mishandling in a way I wouldn't do with a laptop, or a Pi for that matter.

The limitations I've found are linux-general instead of Odoid-specific, e.g. Flash videos, Excel to Libre-office macros etc.

As a home-server, I'm still trying to break it with genuine use-cases. I won't ever go near a shop-bought NAS after using the U3.

I'd say for everyday use, the XU3 isn't needed - a U3 will easily do anything a 300 - 400 laptop will (outside of GPU instensives, e.g. gaming) and take up next to no space.

Plus it's low energy needs means less heat and no fans - the joy of silence.

A remarkable piece of kit for 99 to my door, so I've ended up with 3 of them ;) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm typing via a U3 right now as my desktop / surfing computer, have another as my TV pc / XBMC box - and another as my home server which can take much more than I thought it would. Great little things.

Fell hard for the U3, the XU3 looks amazing though I've saturated any need for more mini-PCs at this stage. 

The C1 looks very tempting, hard to justify a Pi when this is available. I wonder if this is Hardkernel's response to not getting any more Pi chips for W model.

The only drawback for me is that while the [odroid forum](http://forum.odroid.com/) is great for help and news, it is bewildering for new-comers.

Finding the latest images / software can be a pain without checking huge threads to see if there are patches or better solutions than the immediately obvious links. There's a lot of cruft left over from previous versions and solutions which I think should be archived off to a distinct section of the site.

That said, I wouldn't be without them now.

For those who are thinking of taking the plunge, do go for the eMMC options over the SD card. The SD card is fine, and is a handy way to test images etc but the eMMC is much more pleasant once you've settled on an OS, set-up etc. The images will all go on an 8gb eMMC.

I gave one to my non-techy brother as both an XBMC tv solution and a TV pc, loves it and with the little wireless keyboard I gave him more than able to navigate around.

All hassle-free, just told my landlord what Digiweb needed to do to the house - he was thrilled at the idea of an upgrade out in the boonies. When I moved Digiweb uninstalled the receiver etc. from the old house.

I checked with Eircom when I moved to that old house and their answer was a flat-fee of 300 "for works" although the wiring was complete so I would have paid that cash simply for activation.

The landlord wasn't going near such a bill - and neither was I.

There was even a dial-tone when I plugged a phone into the obvious socket in the house.

And so my dislike and distrust of Eircom was born.

<TEXT> I'm not sure how true this still is (or was) but a French friend told me that come results time and assuming a minimum achievement in grades, students went to the universities they liked and basically queued for the courses they wanted to enter.

The completely unsuitable were weeded out by the 1st year exams and too bad for them then - they were gone.

It sounds like a nightmare, but also sounds like those stymied by choices made in school have a chance to redirect their trajectories rather than sticking to what their 5th year subject choices confined them to.

I made a mess of uni the first time, and it wasn't until my mid-20s I decided to try again. Much better then.

Sometimes I wonder if a deferment for a year, combined with a tax-break on any work during that year towards future education fees etc. would really help students choose a course they genuinely want, while giving them a very good reason to enter the workforce first.

That year of work being the impetus and awareness to pick a course they really wanted, rather than being swept along with the pressure to get a degree first then experience later. </TEXT>

Even with very sensitive cases in Ireland theyre not prosecuted in camera, said TJ McIntyre, lecturer at University College Dublins school of law and chairman of advocacy group Digital Rights Ireland.

The companies would be prosecuted in secret, and would be unable to disclose their objections publicly  or even the fact that they were being prosecuted.

Indeed, it's also not a "huge percentage" - it's a significant percentage.

My point being that Irish companies (the vast employers) are at a competitive disadvantage because of loopholes they're not big enough to exploit, while MNs are.

We could have a home-grown eBay, Google etc. but we'd never get past the start-up phase as the tax decks are stacked against.

12.5% is great, let's keep it that way and let's have a free-market that obeys it. That's competition isn't it?

The usual figure given for multinational employment is between 25   30% - though as we can see from the total labour workforce it's ~7%.

Even at 25%, the vast majority of Irish people are employed by Irish companies who would struggle to get a team of accountants and lawyers together to avail of tax loopholes in the same manner multinationals do.

Was it beyond reason to simply send them both the Irish   English text at the same time?

They are the Department of Arts, Heritage and the **Gaeltacht** after all.

<TEXT> here are some Irish sites

First up, blogs.telegraph.co.**uk**

tell me more about 'how i know nothing about Ireland'

I just have, but here are some more, children in Ireland are not taught anti-semetic or anti-Israel anything in any official sense.

That some schools take their own view, bear in mind your examples are based in very religious areas of Ireland, isn't right but then we don't check out schools every day with every teacher and I doubt any country does.

Though in my schooling, the very same system, we were given a very positive view of Israel and Israelis.

I still have a fantastic series of jewish artwork on my walls reprinted from a very old jewish calendar. My brother spent considerable time in kibbutz and is still in contact with people he met there.

I still can't believe you think a .uk is an Irish site, are you trolling yourself?

With regard to your sources, there are practically all blogs and opinion pieces. </TEXT>

Though, more seriously, your point about the courts is well taken.

If the pay, pensions etc. to people such as Kerins and Flanney were simply stopped - they would have to go to the courts to get satisfaction.

So in turn providing an opportunity to explain in front of a judge and the country why the government feels uncomfortable giving them any more money in light of their actions.

It is the public airing of these issues that makes K   F squirm - the government doesn't seem to scare them at all. </TEXT>

The internet may be socialising young people into near-absolute conformity when they have not yet developed sufficient maturity to realise what is happening

And Rock Music will lead to Satanism, yadda yadda yadda ...

Nevermind taking it as an argument to remove religion from students' school education as **it may** create a near-absolute conformity when they have not yet developed sufficient maturity to realise what is happening.

It's another missed opportunity from Breda to have a sensible debate or write a coherent piece on the variety of influences that are literally at everyone's fingertips, not only the school-aged.

<TEXT> Useless.

I was in a minor fender-bender the other week, 3 distinctly different cars.

After 15 minutes getting everyone's tax details etc., the Senior Garda still didn't know which car belonged to who and accused one of the drivers of giving him incorrect info. Until it was pointed out to him that he was looking at the wrong car.

Never mind the Ban Garda sent out around the town on her own, got a coat thrown over her and beaten up. She was sent out on her own again a few weeks later.

A local thug who assaulted a Garda in the station yet is still free as a bird. Though there's also a laundry list of property damage and assault cases against him.

Utterly bloody useless.

They must be able to de-rail the political campaigns of anyone they choose with simple innuendo, shame   embarrassment. They'd keep evidence of wrong-doing, if any, as a trump card.

So if someone wants to get into politics in the US without their say-so, they would have to avoid all interent   voice coms from the day they were able to use them until the end of a successful campaign - i.e. next to impossible.

And:

It was confirmed yesterday by Taoiseach Enda Kenny that Irish Water is to be taken out of the control of the Department of Environment, which is now run by Labour's Alan Kelly, and brought under the auspices of Michael Noonan's Department of Finance.

<TEXT> I'd like to know the reasoning / market-forces behind the Price of New Games in the EU region (Sterling prices too), my views:

* All main platforms are x86 based these days - I thought this would have helped reduce dev costs and so prices.

* Game assets are built high-res to ensure PC porting (if not already done on PC beforehand anyway)

* It's making me avoid release-day purchases as I can spend that 25 difference on many other games, and frankly other things in life, especially when I can't see a 25 improvement in next-gen games overall.

* It's not just a Sony thing, so apologies if this sounds targeted, but at the current prices I won't be getting release-day games anyway.

* The Second-Hand market is having a field-day with this, so I can't see how the current pricing is benefiting devs.

* Counter-point, games like Watch_Dogs are selling anyway - but I can't be in a small minority, so I reckon a 'market-starvation' effect will be short-lived and ultimately will back-fire.

I've gone from being a regular release-day buyer on the PS3 (where new games are 50 to 55) to a definite second-hand buyer on the PS4.

The games haven't suddenly become 25 better or more interesting, the reverse if anything.

So the lull in gaming for me will probably last till December, when I'll be able to buy games for a reasonable price.

So glad I went for Wolfenstein at 50 on release, rather than Watch Dogs at 75. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good, better than yesterday morning which was a false no-hangover followed by the real hangover in the afternoon.

Nonetheless managed to go to a debate on the 'right-to-be-forgotten' at the Hay festival which while more introductory than anything else was still interesting.

Susan O'Keefe recounted the story of a teacher who told her students to bring an embarrassing photo into school the following day and they'd put it on the school gates.

The students were understandably horrified. To which the teacher replied 'well you put them up online everyday' and the students seemed to get the point.

The representatives from Google   Transparency International were good too - the debate could have gone on for hours I reckon. Probably just as well that it didn't though, the hangover came back with a vengence. Naps were had.

So today I'm all sparkly, up at 7 trying to work out why my home-server is in a mood (or at least the powerline plugs are) and looking forward to the food tent's Beer   Tapas thing at 6 today.

Kinda wish it was earlier. </TEXT>

<TEXT> All terrible awful things and seemingly intractable in terms of negotiation. But did Hamas spring from nothing? No it sprang from how they feel they are treated.

It doesn't forgive their views or aims, but it does indicate how to weaken them as a driving force in this lengthy conflict. If Hamas are the obstacle then the solution is stop letting them have causes and events they can point to for support.

NI isn't like Israel, but once UK forces killed civilians in Bloody Sunday the conflict radically altered. Similarly, Israel's sometimes disproportionate responses to provocations and Palestinian violence gives Hamas all the cause they need to garner more support.

Cooler heads have to prevail, or the conflict really will be endless. </TEXT>

<TEXT> All very important distinctions in history, but the point I wanted to make was about the possibility of similar solutions, or at least the real possibility of a solution. Something NI didn't have for a good while.

Nothing improved in NI until everyone decided the negotiation table was better than attending funerals, and preventing further radicalising events.

As for calls to genocide by Hamas, they are crazy and also not every Palestinian.

Calls to wipe out Catholics / Protestants / Republicans / Unionists haven't vanished in NI either but the anger   grief necessary to create those views has reduced.

tl;dr - Negotiations are the only way out, anything else will be genocide for one side or the other. And if that happens, 50 years from now threads like these will still be posted.

<TEXT> A better negotiation position is never going to be a bad idea. Hamas' election wasn't going to be a welcome development but it was entirely predictable.

Hamas being elected is a revenge vote, not entirely unheard of in Israeli politics either - or anywhere else for that matter.

Furthering settlements will further the appeal of Hamas and their ilk.

Guerilla warfare is insidious and does not need a 'nation state' to support it.

If Hamas is to be stopped, then their supporters need to be given a better solution. Nobody voted for the IRA in NI, they voted for Sinn Fin - the political wing associated with the IRA but not the IRA. A debate still continues about how much hair-splitting that actually was but it was enough to keep the ball rolling to peace.

It's not a fast process, the 'Troubles' in NI were decades long.

Margaret Thatcher signing the Anglo-Irish agreement wasn't something her manifesto suggested when she came to power but it happened.

Yet afterwards was no picnic at all - there were still bombs and horrific violence. Nonetheless without it, there wouldn't have been grounds to find a more lasting solution.

It's a bunch of people who know the final jigsaw picture, but not sure of where the pieces they hold go. Yet they don't give up, because they want their grandchildren to have better lives. </TEXT>

It's time to try something new, overdue really - nobody is feeling safer.

Hamas are lunatics, shooting stone-throwing kids at a border is also lunacy. There's no gain in any of these tactics on either side.

If the idea is that one side should 'win', both sides will lose something.

What international investors will decide on the region if they think their business will blow up or that they must pick one over the other while risking retaliation from the side they didn't pick.

It's not going to be remotely easy, but both sides vote for people to fix this not prolong it. The begrudgery won't end for years, but as the NI process has shown peace needs to come first - the pointing fingers can come later.

An Israel and a Palestine that can live together will be a much stronger force in the region than one that wants to destroy each other. </TEXT>

It seemed intractable and pointless in NI, but endless grieving is much worse than making elected reps sit at the table for years if necessary.

Plus, the current solution in NI didn't involve border changes - but a real assessment of the damage caused to both sides by both sides.

The 'who is at fault' argument has lost its usefulness. Let the next generation be a bit less used, and a bit more educated.

Bit by bit progress, not blow by blow status quo.

<TEXT> This man is a menace to Irish society.

First he picks Greyhound for refuse collection against the advice of **all** Dublin City Councils.
Greyhound have their registration in the Isle of Man with its more generous tax options, as well as a laundry list of court cases against them.

The Isle of Man is, coincidentally, also home to a number of pension and investment funds that specialise in Refuse   Recycling. Pension   Investment funds being more focused on end results (profits) than working conditions, living wages etc. for any company in their portfolios.

Surprise, surprise - here we are a little later with 30% payroll cuts being mooted for Greyhound employees who have now gone on strike as a result. Is Greyhound part of an investment portfolio? I don't know - but it sure looks like it.

Then Irish Water and its mystery charges which were meant to be detailed this week, after several other 'deadlines' have been missed. He infamously stated that he didn't know all the costs involved or why Irish water was spending so much money on consultants. Though simultaneously insisted that his department knew all the costs involved.

The free allowance for Children is also to be cut apparently, but we don't know those details either.

Let's not forget his commitment to reducing quangos and increasing transparency in county council spending - only to then shelve the report on it and, naturally, create a new quango instead.

The man is not remotely true to his word, his actions have had consequences that range from the frankly suspicious to the stunningly callous.

It also worth noting that in his declaration of interests to the Dil he has **no** assets, apart from a gifted membership of the K Club. No house in his name, no investments of any kind. Or in other words, someone who could be very easily persuaded by a tempting bribe (assuming the declaration to be honest).

<TEXT> Well, project Morpheus will be great for games just like the Oculus Rift will but of course that's not the only thing VR can be good for.

Something like 'Second Life' with a VR interface seems like a logical next step and potentially a VR killer-app, but Sony are unlikely to get or ask for detailed Second Life data. The solution, they made their own.

Ok, Home was a bit more basic but it still had plenty of valid data points they could analyse: PSN ID data, movement through Home-space itself, spending habits if any, network congestions in a shared 3D world and even simple collision data (very handy to know for VR to avoid nausea).

Home got such derision and sneering it was hard to see why Sony kept at it, unless it provided useful data for some other purpose. My guess is that that purpose is shared with Project Morpheus.

Someone or some company is eventually going to make the first commercial   global 'baby Matrix' and I think Sony want to be in with the best chance they can.

I don't think Facebook bought Oculus just because they could - they want FB users to 'walk' via Facebook   Oculus through a global VR world.

I think Sony have been giving a 'baby Matrix' more thought and work than Facebook: e.g. PS Move, 3D in general and Morpheus itself.

That task would be much better with actual 3D world usage data. It just looked like Home so none of us really noticed.

<TEXT> Yeah. I'd assumed there was some EU preference not to go the electricity route as telecom companies would have lost massive amounts of business - and lobbied accordingly.

It reminds me of debate over the Hydrogen fuel-cell car or the Electric Battery car - both have their plus points. But one already has infrastructure in every house in the country, so I'm guessing we'll end up with the other, Hydrogen, because lobbying.

I reckon fuel companies don't want people charging batteries with solar panels and the like because there's no money in that for them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think this says more about E3 than No Man's Sky. 

Many AAA ~~games~~ publishers seem to follow Hollywood (teasers, trailers, reveals ...
) rather than capitalising on games' unique opportunities with a Hollywood flair.
 
The AAA scene is hamster-wheeling on pre/se-quels. 

So I'm waiting till games reach the bargain-bin as there's no rush to play re-skinned games anyway. Though these days that means little against pre-order sales.

I hope No Man's Sky is great and maybe it becomes the 'Forbidden Planet' of sci-fi gaming.

Yet for every 'reveal' of any game I see - I think of one of the first reddit comments I read:

Got 80 fine, went to local Garda station told "you can't pay that here, go to the Post Office".

I went to the Post Office, and it wouldn't scan in - the barcode fading more each time a scan was attempted. Then the number was typed in manually, but the system glitched as it had partially processed one of the supposedly failed scans.

Nothing more to do in the Post Office, I went back to the Garda and explained and they said a new fixed fine notice would be sent out.

Then a new notice to say the fine had gone up because I hadn't paid the first one. I called to explain what had happened and yes a new notice would be sent.

Never happened.

Mr Donnelly warned that Taoiseach Enda Kenny can now set the inquiry's terms of reference, decide who is questioned, exclude certain events from consideration and **even veto the final report.**

I wish someone would find definitive evidence that Enda was in league with Alan Shatter over Garda cover-ups, then we could have a GE sooner rather than later.

<TEXT> I'm not sure either way if McGuiness overstepped the bounds of his role by suggesting resignations. I imagine he's supposed to wait till the PAC produces its report. Though that sounds extremely frustrating.

Anyway, is there not an equivalency between McGuinness 'politicising' the PAC, and Enda unilaterally creating a majority on the Banking Inquiry terms-of-reference panel?

Surely if McGuinness is at fault, then Enda is too?

Am I getting this wrong or has Enda reached new bionic-asshole levels of hypocrisy? </TEXT>

"Past vote weighted and adjusted for spiral of silence" which I'm assuming is what point #5 in the first slide means.

"weighting back 50% undecided to how they voted in past elections" - They looked at previous polls and examined how the "Don't knows" ultimately voted in previous general elections and then added that trend into the results. So the difference between the number of first preferences in the new poll and the final seat tally is a combination of the new poll's data weighted for the likely decisions of the "Don't knows" on election day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Enda said 

our legislation is very strong and **ethically implemented** and we will defend that robustly.

How are effective tax rates ethical when Irish companies pay 12.5% while it's 0.14% for Google and 3.7% for Apple? How is it ethical for an Irish government to treat Irish companies with this disadvantage?

We can't compete in these areas because of the huge advantage given to these companies. If an Irish government wants a vibrant, successful home-grown IT sector - then don't stack the deck against them.

Irish companies employ the vast majority of people in Ireland 70%. That's the sector we should be helping.

<TEXT> Mr Justice Cooke found as not convincing the accounts that an **wireless AV remote control device for audio and video equipment in GSOC** was connecting and transferring data to an external Bitbuzz hotspot in a nearby caf.

So that was the type of wireless device everyone was wondering about - a remote. And GSOC were certain they'd no Wifi devices in their office. Did they not know the equipment came with a wifi remote? Why were Verrimus worried about it then? It's good to have the report done,  better have a look at [all of it](http://cdn.thejournal.ie/media/2014/06/gsoc-report-final-redacted.pdf) though.

edit - Plenty to read in there:

9.81. The Commissioners expressed the view that the suggestions made in the Rits Report
seeking to undermine the Verrimus Reports are not credible. Furthermore, **the series
of third party efforts made to influence the evidence to be given to the Inquiry by
Verrimus are unexplained and of concern.** They expressed the view that There is no
credible expert opinion that disputes the existence of the threats identified by
Verrimus.

Well, it looks like getting Rits involved was the BS move many thought it was.

<TEXT> Certainly, and we can't all become experts in every field - so we rely on news outlets to at least do some hours of research before coming to conclusions.

It's probably not an example of sinister politics but these 'lazy journos' will become unwitting stooges if they (or we) don't cop on.

e.g.

RT: "Analysis of the cases shows people treated for this infection **are four times more likely to have consumed untreated water from a private well.**"

thejournal.ie: "People treated for VTEC **are four times more likely to have consumed untreated water from a private well.**"

The original [HSE report](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/Campaigns/wellsepa.html): "**Analysis of cases shows that people treated for VTEC are four times more likely to have consumed untreated water from a private well.**"

There's nothing wrong with quoting a report, but they both seem to avoid it.

Interestingly enough, the HSE report cites its own sources which in [2009](http://www.hpsc.ie/A-Z/Gastroenteric/VTEC/Factsheet/) makes no specific mention of private water-wells as a vector (though this coincides with the EPA's reporting period of its 30% claim) while another HSE source from [Oct 2013](http://www.hpsc.ie/A-Z/Gastroenteric/VTEC/VTECandwater/) - leads to a claim that "Untreated private water supplies are an important method of spread: VTEC patients are **3 or 4 times more likely** to consume untreated well or other private water than people who do not develop VTEC".

Nevermind the statistical weirdness of comparing VTEC via one vector versus those with no infection, rather than those with VTEC infections via other means.

Anyway, it looks like vague reporting based on skimmed reports compounded by out-of-date and conflicting reporting periods. May as well throw in political interference, it's a mess anyway. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Aye, Air Quality measurement and reporting was my job for a while.

There's no chance I would have kept the job by asserting dangers with data that old.

At best I think these reports are overstating a known issue, at worst I think they're serving a viewpoint that does not have any current evidential support.

What I do believe is certain is that RT   the.journal et al have copy and pasted rather than spend an hour or two looking at the source data / reports.

I think the OP is on point with regard to a 'lazy journalism' approach from RT etc.

Is it on point with regard to a politically vested interest, who knows? In RT's case it wouldn't be the first time.

I don't think these concerns should be dismissed automatically.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Very possibly, though we don't know how much the water will cost per litre yet ;)

Though for [the numbers](http://www.independent.ie/business/personal-finance/want-to-dodge-water-bills-with-a-well-heres-the-drill-30053308.html), it's around 4,500 to 5,000 - you can get a grant which will cover no more than 2,031.58. So around 3,000 all in.

If water charges are at the estimated 420 per year, then ~7 years using as much water as you like! Of course if the water charges go up, then it would take less time to recoup the investment. Plus it won't have that taste of treatment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If it's the 'local lunatics' you mean - then my town has a few plastic-bag men. They just walk around most days, frequently with a plastic-bag that has little or nothing in it. Though perhaps it's for company or purpose on the huge amount of walking they all do.

There's probably a business opportunity there for people who need their dogs walked, and for these poor souls to have better company on their walks, plus a bit of canine therapy.

I think the Fall had a song about them, 'Carrier-Bag Man', decades later they're still going around. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Which is one part of voting for the EPP I don't understand, from the above link:

* Strengthening of the common immigration and asylum policy and integrating immigrants

Voting for an EPP candidate means increasing the chances that someday immigration is dealt with by a central, federal authority - not nationally.

A possibility I imagine a lot of FG voters wouldn't like.

We can see it in France where the huge vote for the Front National stemmed from this very issue. Marine Le Pen has made stopping further EU integration her #1 priority because she believes the EU will take that national immigration decision away.

Front National scare me much more than the EPP, though I reckon a lot of people in Ireland would want to keep immigration decisions at the national level just like FN do - yet have voted EPP anyway. </TEXT>

Also, the initial surge in adrenalin / panic at the start of an exam subsides after ~15 mins. So if you spend the first 15 mins, checking the questions you're going to answer and preparing them. You should feel much calmer for the rest of it.

It was argued the  Minister, in seeking to amend his claim, was seeking to "gloss over" serious factual  inaccuracies in his original statement of claim. These inaccuracies had not been properly explained by the Minister, counsel added.

Mr Justice Paul Gilligan ruled the Minister was entitled to amend his statement of claim. The case will be listed for hearing before a Judge and jury at a future date. </TEXT>

Meanwhile Sherlock, a TD for Cork East, has re-entered the race having **earlier this week ruled himself out** of both the leader and deputy leadership contests.

I want to [be] part of the process of renewal of this party, he said in a statement.

To do that I feel that the position of deputy leader will allow me to assist to rebuild the organisation. 

I believe I have the energy and the capability to try this agenda with a new party leader and I look forward to the election taking place.

Labour is not singing in a chorus on the leadership elephant in the room. 
A Labour councillor who has lost his seat on Kells town council in Meath has said that Eamon Gilmore should go as the leader of the party if he has any respect for the membership and the people on the ground. Having served on the town council for ten years, Brian Collins was eliminated this morning at the Navan count centre having polled just 395 first preference votes. He said: Im gutted for myself but its been humiliating nationally."

<TEXT> From RT 11.32

Pat Rabbite has said he thinks Eamon Gilmore should continue as leader of the Labour party. He said he did not know if there will be a leadership challenge and said he was not aware of any moves against him.

They'll be in even more trouble as a party if they don't let him go surely.

<TEXT> [Jared Diamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse:_How_Societies_Choose_to_Fail_or_Succeed) was fairly worried about Australia's prospects nearly 10 years ago but I doubt he expected Tony Abbott:

["The final chapters of Collapse are devoted to the contemporary, developed world. The perilous state of the Australian environment gives Diamond reason to suspect that Australia may be the first developed state to collapse under environmental pressures. This may initially seem absurd to many Australian readers, but Diamond demonstrates convincingly that societies typically collapse when at the height of their dynamism and affluence, because that is precisely when resource demand is greatest."](http://www.theage.com.au/news/Reviews/Collapse/2005/02/23/1109046981193.html) </TEXT>

But I thought the whole point of the peace process was: to stop any more violence, and any more recrimination.

I think that first part has more or less happened - so I'm going to accept the second to ensure the first; as wrong as that may be - it's better than more bloodshed.

I have 3 cameras feeding into the Odroid and use 'motion' to sense   ftp the images. This barely stresses the Odroid.

They're fanless, quad-core 2gb-ram little beasties with no more of a learning curve than a Pi. Also, they're a tiny bit smaller than a Pi.

I keep the Pi for XBMC   hobby projects. The GPU hardware drivers on the Pi makes them slightly better at XBMC than an Odroid.

But for server, desktop-computer   game-emulator purposes the Odroid is very hard to beat at the price. Plus, the [forums](http://forum.odroid.com/viewforum.php?f=75 sid=10ba83ada948d9cf878eaeaa83530e9d) are great. Do go for an eMMC card if you buy one, much faster than the SD card option. </TEXT>

Plus, we don't need this speculation at all. We can just ask 'Alan Shatter   Officials' when the meeting was held and check their diaries.

I'm sure the Taoiseach doesn't drive around on his own either, so wouldn't the driver service have a record of where he was that day and when they drove him there?

<TEXT> Yeap same day as Sinn Fin are asking about.

I'd be inclined to go with the harmless interpretation that "I wasn't in Dublin until around 4", grand, the meeting in the Shelbourne was at 4.30; plus "Sunday morning meetings are rare, but I wasn't in Dublin at all." [at that time, but I was in Dublin later].

However, considering the early morning Shatter meeting was in the diary for the 23rd and is about the Garda business - it's all seeming a little suspect. Alan Shatter had no intention of resigning back in March. Plus the idea that the diary is filled out retrospectively is bad practice or just smoke-screen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a cash-grab when it's not being used for its stated purpose. 

PRSI is used to provide for you if you fall ill   can't work or lose your job (i.e. social insurance)

I'm for water charges in principle   practice, but as a conservation and infrastructure maintenance measure. Not this cludge from a government that still hasn't told us the cost per litre. Do they not know or are they not saying? Well, it's election time so I'm guessing it's both.

Putting in meters rather than fixing the leaks first, tells me this is more the prelude to privatisation than an environment resource measure. No commodity suits the needs of hedge funds better than water - people will always need it. And the push for privatisation has been going on for some time.

* [The World Bank and the International Development Bank highlighted **water privatization as a requirement for the Bolivian government in order to retain ongoing state loans**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_privatization_in_Bolivia)

* [The World Bank and water privatisation: public money down the drain](http://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/2008/09/art-562458/)

* [Even as the World Bank Group continues to promote water privatization, its own data reveal that a high percentage of its private water projects are in distress. Its project database for private participation in infrastructure documents a 34 percent failure rate for all private water and sewerage contracts entered into between 2000 and 2010](http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/4/water-managementprivatizationworldbankgroupifc.html) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't let [Superintendent Foxtrot](https://imgur.com/Sc8af2c) have anything to do with your life (page 306).

And from [RT](http://www.rte.ie/news/2014/0509/616164-guerin-report/):

The report concluded that Mr Shatter did not heed the voice of Sgt McCabe despite the high esteem in which he was held.

Mr Guerin said that was despite the minister having specific statutory powers in the area of complaints from members.

Mr Guerin said there was a "near total absence" in the papers he had examined of written records of submissions made, or advice given, to the minister by his officials.

He said he had seen no written internal records of decisions made by the minister.

Guerin said the approach adopted "had the result that there was no independent investigation" of Sgt McCabe's complaints.

He concluded that the absence of written records was a "matter of some concern", saying it appeared that the minister had acted "on foot of advice received by the commissioner", without that advice being questioned or analysed.

That is atrocious, Shatter looks like he completely sided with whatever Callinan wanted. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I reckon that's a completely accurate way of looking at this blast from the past.

Here's another, Eamonn Gilmore will say anything while not in power to get votes - he's just a politician after all and not exceptional in this regard or example.

Yet this can tell us 2 things:

* Eamonn hitched his ride to the Workers Party on principles of a fair society / water provision that he no longer adheres to.

* He has yet again (his Lisbon treaty flip-flop) kowtowed to an EU directive over and above the directive's intent (reasonable decision making reforms / water conservation) and decided it's more about cash for institutional fuck-ups. Or at least, let his 'betters' instruct him so.

In any election there are 'turkeys voting for christmas' - e.g. the ~17% who voted FF in the last election - but Eamonn's turkeys and christmas are movable feasts. He doesn't have to worry though, his policy choices do not have to read as any egregious compromise for the country. He'll simply blame the majority partner with a 'what would it have been like without us' reasoning. He may be expecting the limited communication abilities of 80s here, as his stance won't wash in our internet era. 

I've heard plenty of secondary school students get riled up about this blithe indifference to the net, netizens and it's technorati. As if the net's only an exaggeration-engine and not also the 'printing-press' with a power Irish newspapers envy.

His eyes are on his life after politics. I think his leadership will retire what 'Labour' is left of the Labour party, and his party seems fairly fine about it.

That Ireland's electorate vote via reflex, in pluralities, is a daily awful reminder that the Dil is us. We have done this to ourselves to a very large part.

That is no excuse for the failure of its cheerleaders, such as Gilmore though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In fairness, all of those points are **their job** - for which they are paid more than adequately.

Have we reached a point where we expect so little from the Dil that TDs turning up and doing what they're elected to do is laudable?

Here are some other achievements:

* Held a referendum on a stability fund that we can't access a year and a half before we would have needed it anyway. Losing a negotiating position in the process.
* Asserted the need for a pay-cap in public positions, which is then flouted by the Taniste.
* Let the Minister for Justice mislead the Dil after he revealed a TD's penalty point situation live on national TV. None of which jeopardises his job.
* Failed to address the shortcomings of the Data Protection Commissioner which has now lead to the drafting of new EU laws, one of which is specifically designed to avoid the need for EU citizens to go through that Irish office to make complaints.
* Allowing a debt defaulter to be in charge of the country's biggest budget which, surprise surprise, he can't balance.
* Failed to address the egregious loopholes exploited by foreign multinationals which sees a certain company pay 0.14% in tax, instead of 12.5%. Meanwhile Irish companies the absolutely vast employers of people in Ireland see new levies, taxes   rates while remaining on 12.5%. Corporate welfare at its finest.
* Introduced a Property tax   soon a Water charge which makes a mockery of maintaining basic social welfare rates and rates of income tax.
* Increased school classroom numbers which are now the highest in Europe.
* Fails to acknowledge that much of recovery in this country would not have been possible without the ~400,000 people who have left Ireland over the past 5 years for work. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm against it as the consequences of failure could lead to the irradiation of an entire province. Plus our electricity demands don't require a nuclear power station.

To look at Germany, Spain   Portugal achieve 40% upwards of their needs via renewables last year - it would seem irrational of us to go with nuclear.

Then the cost of the radioactive waste disposal is a bill our childrens' Ireland have to pick up, and most countries with the capacity will not accept another country's waste. IIRC there are ships with nuclear waste which simply circle the globe while governments fight over who is going to take it.

I think nuclear is a solution to a problem we don't have, and there are better solutions available. Finally, when a country with the engineering expertise and reputation such as Germany reckons they can do without - why would we join the nuclear party when everyone else is leaving for very good reasons. </TEXT>

I've no interest in this government or any other one privatising domestic water provision by stealth. And it's unlikely this can be anything else, plus I really don't appreciate having to pay for the metering such companies will have to rely on. In fairness, Phil Hogan is in charge of it - and we all saw the suspicious fiasco he caused with Greyhound.

On a more general note, I'll do my upmost to make sure that any issues that effect the whole country will be "trawled in the media" at every opportunity I get.

Of course, in case anyone has forgotten here's a [little link](http://www.broadsheet.ie/2011/06/01/say-it-aint-so-eamo/) to just how two-faced that travesty of a TD truly is. </TEXT>

The user who creates the majority of these images 'robroy' is fantastic, so asking in the forums would be the best thing.

The first image should fit the bill. I'd certainly start with the images from the forums, rather than creating your own isos, as they work 'out of the box' and take away most of the fiddling around for drivers etc.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I absolutely love them. Versatile and small, I'm setting one up for a friend who wants a pc on their TV and I'll be able to velcro the odroid to the back of the tv for extra tidiness.

Here's a quick comparison [photo](http://i.imgur.com/hQ7KFAx.jpg), U2 on the left and the U3 on top of the Pi. I'm not sure they sell the U2 anymore.

If you do go for one, I'd also get an 8gb eMMC card rather than boot from an SD card - the eMMC are really fast. 

Though it's very handy for testing to use SDs and a lot of people have SDs sitting around unused. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I use an Odroid U2 as a home server, NAS, book server, torrenting machine, motion server and all of that barely stresses it.

They've upgraded it now to the [U3](http://hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php) (an extra USB port, slimmer profile). It's $59 before shipping and is even slightly smaller than the Pi :)

There's loads of tips and projects on the [forums](http://forum.odroid.com/) too. I use one as my main desktop too as they're fanless and silent.

Just to add, I still use my Pi for XBMC as its gpu is better at 1080p than the Odroid's, though not by much. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's the Last of Us for me.

I enjoyed Bioshock: Infinite, its weaker parts are better than many other games' good parts - but I think the game doesn't work as a complete experience in the way TLoU does.

B:I has nowhere near as much tension, and so doesn't pull you in or make you care to succeed / survive to the extent TLoU does.

Often during B:I I felt like I was wondering around a deserted museum. A museum filled with glimpses of the game that could have been, and I suspect a game that was diminished so it could be coded for current-gen consoles (e.g. the difference between the final game and the initial [years old trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajCiS0_ssLE) which still to me has more tension than the acutal game).

I felt I played all the game that Naughty Dog wanted to make and I would have played hours more of it.

I was glad to reach the end of B:I and kinda finished it just to see the end for myself - I was ready to finish the game hours earlier.

<TEXT> Do you think the XB1 has more compute units in the GPU? Wouldn't MS have mentioned that by now? I guess they can't seeing that it was an MS engineer that let slip the info that the XB1 has less.

As for the 'current leaks', that refers to the GPU clock speed. I'm sure if it was a differentiator between the consoles, the console with the higher speed would have announced it already.

If there was an XB1 tech-spec sheet with the same level of detail as the PS4 then we could all settle the differences between the two, when are MS going to reveal more details I wonder. What's the delay?

<TEXT> See for yourself: 

http://www.anandtech.com/show/6972/xbox-one-hardware-compared-to-playstation-4/2

On the graphics side its once again obvious that Microsoft and Sony are shopping at the same store as the Xbox Ones SoC integrates an AMD GCN based GPU. Heres where things start to get a bit controversial. Sony opted for an 18 Compute Unit GCN configuration, totaling 1152 shader processors/cores/ALUs. Microsoft went for a far smaller configuration: 768 (12 CUs).

Microsoft cant make up the difference in clock speed alone (AMDs GCN seems to top out around 1GHz on 28nm), and based on current leaks it looks like both MS and Sony are running their GPUs at the same 800MHz clock. The result is a 33% reduction in compute power, from 1.84 TFLOPs in the PS4 to 1.23 TFLOPs in the Xbox One.  </TEXT>

I'm sure it could be put to use when games aren't running. Though with the consoles expected to be on shelves in 5 months, these drip-feeds of info better not be what developers are also getting. </TEXT>

To be honest, I think the article creates as many questions as it answers.

A detailed one-sheet spec from MS themselves would be handy at this stage, the speculation won't go away until there are some solid numbers.

I won't be getting either console until they've been 'out in the wild' for a while anyway. Though if details don't come soon - I'm betting that MS could end up with a warehouse full of lemons by January. Word spreads a lot faster than it did 7 years ago. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The PS4 hardware has clear advantages.

The XB1's response to these apparent advantages is its eSRAM - if this works as planned it should balance out, some to most of, the hardware differences.

There is only 32MB of the eSRAM available. So it has to used for something important, and also something that isn't (in data terms) very big. Probably data that needs to be quickly delivered and then replaced with an updated version and delivered again. Software will have to be written with that in mind.

If the eSRAM can't be used like this or if it's too tricky to make it useful that way - then devs might avoid it and the processing of the game will suffer. PS4 games would look better and cost less to get looking that way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not that the TV part won't allow me, but that the licensing agreements across Europe are so problematic that there isn't even a standard Netflix catalog.

As for sports, I don't think there's any hope Microsoft can provide on that while even fully licensed national stations can't agree with each other pan-europa.

Plus each nation has its list of national free-to-air sports events that must be shown free-of-charge. Disallowing Microsoft from showing them to Xbox Live only subscribers - not a business incentive for them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, I know there's no solid info - yet when Kinect came out initially there were similar claims to have 'not-abandoned-the-core-gamers'. That didn't pan out and neither did a ground-swell of Kinect fans.

Microsoft will be in a great position if/when they've 8 new games to tout at E3 for the X1 but they don't have a previous delivery on promises to back it up.

Sony have presented many PS4 exclusives already, and they haven't shown the machine yet.

It's all very crazy, but either PR companies are toying with them both for shits/giggles/profits, or one of them will have some pointless advertising bills to pay.

I'm in Europe so the TV part of the X1 won't sell it to me - there needs to be very compelling games; the spy-in-the-cab isn't helping either. </TEXT>

<TEXT> True, but I don't think Microsoft used this as a springboard to E3 - now they really have to bring the fireworks.

Yesterday's announcement should have encouraged many more enthused people for their E3. I think it's creating the opposite. </TEXT>
