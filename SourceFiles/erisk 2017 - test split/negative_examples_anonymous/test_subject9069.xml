<TEXT> Okay, in this book I'm working on I have character A and B. They're sisters. A is a button down, rule-following, reliable salt of the earth type who works the family garden, and B is a more devil may care, adventurous one and the parents tolerate it because in her adventures she has made the family more money than her sister. Both of them want to leave home but the outside world is too big and scary since their village is surrounded by vast jungle and on the other side of that are strange communities. One day there is a huge crisis in the village and in the end, both of them are instrumental in saving the day. 

Which sounds more interesting as a postscript: 

A. Characters A   B, having proven to themselves that they're up to facing the dangers of life head on and left their family with enough money to get by without them, plunge into the largely unknown darkness seeking new sights, new experiences, etc. Character B is more outspoken in her enthusiasm while B is more quietly excited. 

B. Character A finds that now that she's experienced real danger, she's more of an adrenalin junkie than her sister, who learns that real danger isn't as much fun as the trouble she used to get in. So  Character A wants to set out on this adventure and Character B goes along to look out for her sister and to not look like a coward. 

Thank you for your time  </TEXT>

Anyway, if the sacrifices to keep the "Gods" happy affect every country in CitW, they can effect every religion. Different types of religious/supernatural figures are featured in the movie and various supernatural means are used to defeat the monsters that get unleashed (e.g. the Japanese kids putting their pursuer back to spiritual sleep) One of those in question can be the God/Satan of Christian theology. That hand that emerges at the end of the movie? That's Satan's or a being like it. And then he made his way to LA for This is the End.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lately I've been walking to and from work while wearing a sleeveless shirt. As a result, my arms have tanned while my torso stayed pasty white. This morning I did some work digging up a shrub in an undershirt and missed putting sunscreen on both my upper shoulders. So when I took my shirt off, I had chocolate arms, strawberry lower shoulders, and vanilla upper shoulders and clavicles.

Tried to take a picture but my camera's a potato so it didn't really photograph very well.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yesterday there was this guy who looked in pretty decent shape. He was there for awhile with someone and as far as I saw he was just doing a typical workout. But seemingly with every rep, he would make a "HHHRRRUUKK!" noise like he was about to vomit. It didn't sound like physical exertion. And he did this for half an hour, really loudly every time. I wasn't the only one that noticed him either, I heard other people commenting on it. So weird.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I need music for a short film and was curious about your opinions on this. While there are some excellent scores like the one for Psycho or Suspiria, they never really make me scared because the music is so good that it becomes thrilling instead of creepy. To me the most effective music I ever heard in a horror movie was the score for Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which is really ugly and uncomfortable: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3odOfyPz8L8

Would you recommend going more for music that's easier to listen to or going more the discordant and creepy route?

<TEXT> You know, an older Alex DeLarge deciding that he's bored with going around inflicting the old ultraviolence and that he's going to go live a normal life. 

I always thought that was kind of fucked up in how nihilistic it was. That it's supposed to be alright that even though DeLarge was a murderer/rapist, it's fine now because he's stopped and all his victims should just let it go/be ignored. But anyway...

Isn't that kind of inconsistent with how human beings really act? Don't psychopaths not just bored with what they're doing in real life? Isn't it much more likely that DeLarge is just going to keep raping people than that he'll just stop committing crimes?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Watching Jupiter Ascending, I was thinking about how wonderful it all looked, but that the movie's insistence on a fairly generic adventure story kept getting in the way of fully enjoying it. I wondered what movies out there would best allow for just immersing yourself in it, and it seemed to me that it would probably be character pieces and/other eye candy comedies. Are there any like that which come to mind? 

I know there are options like Blade Runner and Dark City, but I was hoping for a break from the more dour stuff.  </TEXT>

It's like my health saw that I was making progress on self-improvement and decided I needed to be tripped up. Like the extremely shitty chickenskin, the terrible teeth, and greasy hair weren't enough ways for my body to keep me unattractive.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know how I managed it, but when I went to see Gone Girl last year, I knew literally nothing about it except that David Fincher had directed it which I believe massively enhanced the experience for me. I still don't really know what some upcoming new movies are about, but I've heard excellent general things about them so I'm looking forward to being able to go into them blind as well. 

This goes completely against my old habits where I would get excited for movies and read several reviews of them, and in hindsight the process would diminish the movies a bit when I saw them in.

<TEXT> I mean Davos. He's well-played and a compelling character, but it seemed like a bit of a cheat that he survived the wildfire explosion when he was so near he could see wildfire leaking out the back of the ship. With him dying, it seemed to give more resonance to the fleet being destroyed and it gave more of a human face to all the people that died in that scene. As is, the main character we've gotten to know who died at that battle was Davos's son, who was kind of one-note and unlikable.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dude, we've seen Arya lose every time she holds up a sword against an armed opponent on equal footing and we've seen Brienne get rough and tumble while moving pretty fast. She could keep up with Jamie (admittedly when he was rusty but he was still probably in better shape than Arya.) 

The Stark Girl would meet her butcher's boy.

<TEXT> I was just watching Interstellar with my brother and he described to me afterwards how towards the end, he was thinking "end! End!" I asked him if what was happening was bad or uninteresting or something, and he said no, but he just felt like the movie should be over. 

I really don't get people watching movies like they have to be film critics. I don't care if a scene doesn't drive the plot forward or if the "peaks and valleys" aren't timed out properly or whatever. I care how interesting the scene I'm watching is or if there's a likelihood based on previous scenes whether it will become interesting. That might say more about me than it does movies, but it just seems like caring about a movie's pace is just giving yourself a reason not to like it.  </TEXT>

I make a couple thousand off stuff I do online and have $30,000 saved up, but I've been worried it will all just crash and burn and then have to move back up here with a worse job. 

So have any of you tried moving away from a town you're tired of, considered that a problem, etc. How'd it work out?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wrote a quick story for NoSleep about a child predator, and people were suggesting a sequel where the guy gets punished because in the end of my story he's still in control of the situation. 

My take on horror is that doing so would weaken the story. That kind of moralism feels cheap and too clean. Like, in reality, I get both the feeling a lot of perpetrators get away with it, so having a punishment in this situation feels off, even though it's a supernatural situation. It also feels like it goes against the point of the story to make people feel uncomfortable. 

Of course people will claim that's an excuse to make exploitation, but I mean solely in regards to how fictional characters are treated.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In another exciting, stupid chapter in "/u/test_subject9069 Goes to the Gym," I tend to go late at night and stay for awhile because I have a lot of calories to burn and a lot of other people have friends or whatever so I feel lonelier being around a bunch of other people. Because the lights are motion activated, apparently I can use an elliptical in the corner and the lights will go out. Last night at like two a.m. another guy showed up who looked like he was in his forties and heavily balding. He seemed surprised to see me there cause the lights were off and I guess he had the same social anxiety I do only much worse, because he went and hid in the bathroom, periodically coming out briefly in his gym clothes before seeing I was still there and going back inside. 

Guess I should start coming in earlier.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Last night I couldn't sleep so I went to the gym. I kind of lost track of time and was still there when the bars closed and people began coming back to the dorms, the gym being near campus. I was on an elliptical, my favorite exercise machine in the world, which faced out one of those windows. 

Now several times, people have come up in front of me and either mocked me by making exaggerated elliptical-machine-use- gestures, mostly I assume because they're drunk or maybe I look weird using the machine at 2 in the morning. 

Last night someone came up to the window again and started doing those little handwaves people do to look cute. I didn't really look but I'd gotten sick of people doing the arm pumping thing at me so I flipped her off. Then I looked over and saw it was by far the most attractive person who'd interacted with me in years looking kind of hurt that I'd done that, and then she turned and walked away. 

Obviously she was probably condescending to me for being the weirdo in the gym at that hour and even if I'd smiled waved back it wouldn't have meant anything, but still, *shit*! 

So, what are some of the ones you've experienced?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You probably aren't an artsy type, but my thing was I found a guy who had an art project he had trouble with finding anyone else willing to help him. He was as insecure/creepy as I imagine people find me, but I just concentrated on getting our stuff done so it wasn't a bother.  Boom! I had an instant wingman and even though I didn't get laid, I know it makes you much less off-putting to women to show up to place with a companion. 

Then after graduation he moved away and since then I kind of lost interest in socializing and projects since about last year.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Mine is kind of gross and obviously the sort of thing a teenager would come up with, but here it goes:

I had a scene where a sort of newly met couple were sleeping together. The girlfriend wakes up, can't get back to sleep, then realizes she's going to fart. So she gets up, goes to the bathroom, pulls her pants down and does it, and then wipes before going back to bed. 

Now, I thought that this was a character thing that would reveal how fastidious and insecure she was in an interesting way, but it kind of came out of nowhere in regards to the rest of the story and struck my "beta readers" for it as so weird and stupid that they actually got mad at me about it. 

Yours?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> My Last Camping Trip </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-31 21:26:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> One day in September of 1983 we decided to go on a patrol camping trip so that wed get some prizes at the end of the year. Our scout troop owned a campsite up on top of a big, rocky hill. It was just our rotten luck that when we agreed to meet to start the campout, there had been a steady rain going on all day that didnt look like it was going to stop for hours. But our parents were all either going away for the weekend or thought rain was no reason to cancel a camping trip. Anyway, it was just barely going to be warm enough for this to be our last chance to have a patrol campout that year.

There were four of us trudging up one of the thin paths on the hill with our limited gear under dismal green ponchos: Me, Eric, Tony, and Sam in that order. We were miserable and irritable except for Tony.

We had reached a point where we enjoyed hurting Tony. Tony was one of those kids that get put into Boy Scouts of America only because they have a parent that wants free babysitting. I imagine most of the time his mom mostly talked to him by yelling at him, and the only way he knew to relate to the rest of us was to annoy us. He was also the youngest guy in my patrol and the shortest so it was fairly easy for us to bully him, especially when we thought he was doing his best to bring it on himself. I think Tony was delighted that the rest of the patrol was already on edge so it would be easier for him to get a rise out of us. At that moment he had decided to focus on Eric.

Eric was a real goody-goody most of the time. He was a pretty good athlete and an A student. Im pretty sure that at fifteen hed never had sex, a puff of anything, or any booze. But he loved beating on Tony as much as the rest of us did. That seemed to be his only vice, and frankly, it kept the guy from creeping me out by being too perfect. Hed certainly looked ready to give someone a beating when I glanced back at him during that little hike.

"Hey, Eric! Tony said. I glanced back over my shoulder. Tony had run up next to Eric like a puppy dog cause he knew otherwise Eric would ignore him. There was barely room on the path for him to do that if he turned himself sideways.

What? Eric said.

I can read your mind! Sometimes Tony would be weird or still like a little kid when he pestered us.

Okay. Eric said. I looked forward again.

Think of a number! I can guess it! Tony was pitching his voice up.

Okay. Eric said.

Its thirty! Tony told him.

No.

Youre just saying that. Really I was right. Wasnt I? Huh, wasnt I? From the sound of ponchos rustling, I assume that Tony began to push against Eric. He would do that for minutes on end if youd let him. Sometimes he might even start humping your leg if you were another scout.

Get away from me! Eric said. I didnt see it, but it was obvious even before I turned round what had happened. Eric thoughtlessly pushed Tony away, just wanting the little creep off him. As narrow and slippery as the trail was, he had pushed Tony off it. Tony screamed as he went down the very steep portion of hill, almost catching several trees before having his legs tripped out from under him by a stump. The stump was unfortunately only a little uphill from a large sandstone rock. Tony went into it headfirst with a sound of a loud crack! I stared at him for half a minute or so then, and he didnt so much as twitch from what I could see.

On my god. Sam said after a long silence, which seemed to snap the rest of us out of it.

Lets go help him.

Yeah. I said. Back then, this meant running down there to carry him to the nearest house out of the park since cell phones for kids were still decades off. I tried to start down the trail but Eric was still standing in the way. He turned to me.

Weve gotta tell people what happened right, Sam stopped and looked over at us. Eric looked down at him. We need to tell everyone that he slipped and fell, got it?

Weve got to help Tony! Sam shouted.

And we will! Eric said. But first, we need to be clear that were going to tell everyone that he fell, right? You got me, thats what we tell everyone?

I dont know, I said, I didnt see it happen. Eric looked and me, and nodded. That seemed good enough for him. Then he looked back at Sam.

You pushed him. We have to help him,  Sam said in bewilderment. Sam had never been the cleverest guy in the patrol, but I would have thought hed have the sense to play along under the circumstances.

We will! Eric responded. But first, I need you to say that youll tell everyone that he slipped and he fell! I nodded desperately at Sam, gesturing for him to tell Eric what he needed to hear so that we could get down there to try to help Tony.

No, Sam said. Eric stared at him.

Alright, Eric said. Lets go. We walked quickly, not about to run for fear of slipping and falling like Tony just had.

It wouldnt have done you much good anyway. Sam said after a little while, apparently trying to help Eric feel better. Tony still would have told everyone you tried to kill him no matter what.

Yeah, but thats Tony. Whod have cared if the rest of us had our story straight? Eric answered, his voice flat. He seemed to speed up from behind Sam.

Which way do you think would be the fastest to- HEY! Eric grabbed Sam. Sam yelled as Eric dragged him to the edge of the path.

Say it! Eric shrieked. Say that youll tell everyone that he slipped! Eric sounded more scared than he did intimidating as he held Sam at the edge of the path, seemingly ready to let him fall.

Fuck you! Sam yelled and he began to flail. He hurt Eric more than I would have expected, judging by how Eric grunted. Maybe it was pure adrenaline, but Sam got free somehow and began pushing him to the other side of the trail, right into a cliff.

Jesus Christ, stop fighting! I yelled at them. I might as well have been speaking Chinese. I took a few steps closer and saw there was murder in both their eyes, so I stepped back. Sam got his hand on Erics chin and pushed his head into the rocks behind him as hard as he could. Eric was really trembling then, like an old man with Parkinsons. It was as if he was experiencing a panic attack in the middle of a fight. Even so he wasnt going to just take Sams beating. He grabbed Sam again and kind of picked him up like Sam was a tackling dummy and then charged forward blindly, Sams poncho over his face. He misjudged the distance to the edge of the path and both Sam and he went rolling down the hill. They struck trees with sickening noises as they fell to a level area.

They were much more fortunate than Tony. I could see their movements and hear them screaming when they stopped falling down the hill. But neither of them even tried to get up.

I walked as quickly as I safely could down the trail and then looped back round to where Sam and Eric were. Both were yelling for my help at first, but as I proceeded down the trail, Eric abruptly went quiet.

My legs broken! Sam told me as soon as he saw me arrive where theyd fallen. The bones sticking out! It was true. His poncho had folded up and I saw the bulge in his lower left pant leg beneath the knee. Blood had soaked through his pants with the rainwater.

Hey, Eric said flatly. His lack of emotion made me look over at him as Sam screamed at both of us. I think I hurt my spine. I cant move my legs. I cant feel them. From what I could see of how his body was twisted, that might well have been possible. I didnt know then how Eric could be so emotionless about it, but in hindsight of course he was in shock if not in psychological denial.

Alright, guys, Ill go do what I can for Tony, and then Ill get help for everyone. I said. Sam screamed at me that that was the wrong thing to do, that I should leave the park to get help immediately. For all my first aid training, I didnt know if either of us were right. I thought maybe there was something I could do with the first aid kit for Tony, whose injury had seemed the most severe. Maybe Tony had vomited and I had to clear his breathing passage. I had to check on him. I tried to reassure them before leaving. Sam swore at my back as I ran over to Tony while Eric remained quiet.

I ran to where Id seen Tonys head hit the rock. I had walked by it on hikes and camping trips numerous times and knew the rocks and trees. Id seen the rock that Tony had hit his head on numerous times and knew when Id reached it. When I did, I froze for what felt like minutes.

Tony was gone.

There was no sign hed been there except for some blood had pooled by the rock where hed struck his head. It was still wet and red on the sandstone. I looked around and called for him. I ran a short distance each way around the rock. I didnt see a sign of him. Not a footprint in mud, a drop of blood. Anything.
I something else as I searched. Sounds seemed to be fading away. I could hardly hear the rain around me. I couldnt even hear my footsteps in the shallow puddles on the ground. I couldnt even hear Sam although I had been seconds before. My own voice seemed muffled to my ears. I had been afraid before, but Id never known the sound to fade away like that.

I began to feel something. Not the feeling you get when youre being watched, but the one you get when someone you fear is standing right over you. I turned, and there was no one there, of course. The feeling didnt let up. It seemed to grow stronger and stronger. There was nothing to hear, not even my own breathing or the beat of my heart.

I ran back to where Id left the other two scouts, as fast as Ive ever run towards anything. Slowly I could hear again that Sam was still screaming in pain and cursing out Eric. Eric barely moved his head to look at me when I arrived. Sam went quiet after I told them of Tonys disappearance.

How? was all Sam could think to say. I felt that sensation again of a presence all around me again. It was faint but noticeable.

I dont know. Sam, how are your arms? Can I carry you out of here pack strap style? I had two years and eighteen inches of height on Sam, so I knew I could carry him out. Sam said I would. Whatever presence I was feeling, he seemed aware of it too through his pain and he didnt need to be sold on being taken out of the park, painful though it would surely be. I got out my first aid kit quickly, left my pack on the ground, and hastily made him a splint. He screamed as I lifted him up on my back.

Wait! What about me?! Eric asked, some emotion back in his voice. I glanced over at him. His eyes were wide, and his skin was becoming pale.

I can only carry one person. Well get you help as fast as we can.

But, what if whatever made Tony disappear Looking back on Eric, I find it hard to fault him now. He was just a kid. Hed made a mistake, meaning only a little if any harm. The a smaller amount of harm that wed all inflicted on Tony time and again. Then hed seen all his life, all his accomplishments, his future, all about to be tarnished because of what hed accidentally done to someone we all mostly thought of as dirt. He overreacted like probably many of us would back when we had little life experience and perspective of a guy in his lower teens. But at the time, I just glared at him for a second as he lay twisted and helpless on the ground, reaching up to me.

Maybe you deserve it, I told him. I turned my back on him and began carrying Sam out of the park.

Hey! Im sorry! I didnt mean to hurt Tony! I wasnt going to drop Sam! I was bluffing! Im sorry! Ill do anything you want if you get me out of here! Ill give you everything! Please! Dont leave me alone! What was that!? Theres, theres something out here! Come back! Please! I swear that Ill do anything! Please! Pleeeaase! Come back! His voice faded quickly, and the sound of rain and Sams pain resumed. As I walked, the feeling of that presence faded as well.

I had almost a mile to go in the rain before there would be a house with a phone, and Sam was moaning and wincing practically with every step. I made slow, frustrating progress for a few hundred yards before I slipped and landed heavily on my left knee. Sam screeched in my ear after his upper chest his my shoulder.

I think I broke a rib back there! You cant carry me like this! I didnt know how he could have broken a rib and only started to feel it now but I wasnt about to argue. As carefully as I could in my anxiety, I placed him on the ground in a sitting position and switched the carrying style to firefighter carrying style so that he was mostly over my shoulder.

Is that better? I asked him when Id hoisted him back up. He had winced again as I held him up.

It still hurts, but its better. We rounded a curve on the trail and were approaching a fairly gentle slope where the parking lot was situated. I thought of it then as the end of the park. Sam had begun to feel easier to carry, so I felt then Id be able to make it out of this forest.

I remember that since Id been in the park many times before, and even with another scout on my back being carried like this who was constantly voicing his pain, things were coming back to normal. Whatever feeling Id experienced over where I had thought Tony disappeared was going away. Things began to feel so normal that the idea Tony had just gotten up and walked away and emergency services would soon find him was believable. I guess what I felt then was that all I had to do was carry Sam and then it would be up to the adults to take care of all this.

Oh Jesus, Sam suddenly said quietly. Run. Run! Run! Fucking Run! Before I could ask or turn to see what I was to run from, he struck me as hard as he could on the side. He did this again and again, even after I started running. It was difficult to run even a few steps with such a heavy, awkward weight. It became easier when I noticed something that was already too familiar: Sams voice became quieter even as he thrashed and screeched more shrilly on my back. He might have said what it was or described anything about it, but within seconds he was as muted as my silent steps in the puddles on the pathway.

I reached the bottom of the incline. Sam was convulsing then, which I felt was a sign that whatever I was trying to flee was getting closer. He was still hitting me in the side, but it was weaker and more erratically.

The path up the hill was full of loose rocks and gravel. In weather like this it was impossible to keep a solid foothold, but by some miracle I was able to run up it and maintain a hold on him even as he practically seemed to be trying to break free and I was trembling. I remember thinking that I faintly heard something then, something like a splash. That had to be a good sign.

Halfway up the hill I felt a horrible sensation in my feet. They were going numb. I remember not understanding why, and even with all the momentum I had built up, my feet landed awkwardly, like Id slipped on ice but still landed on my feet. I barely had time to feel pain in my ankles because they went numb as well. I was barely able to stumble forward before the numbness climbed up to my knees. My legs were useless then. I fell forward practically face first.

Sam got free even with his fractures, flipped over, and crawled up the hill. I tried myself. I could feel the numbness had reached my ribcage by then, but dragged myself across the rocks. I remember perfectly the sight of Sam dragging himself too while twitching and trembling as he crawled.

A force hit the back of my head that felt like a construction beam dropped from a crane. My face went into the ground, rocks stabbing into my cheeks hard enough to break the skin and I seemed to lose all fight and flight instinct. I just lay there like a breathing corpse. Even if I hadnt been numb I didnt have any energy, any hope, any understanding of what was happening to me. I didnt even have the courage to lift my hood up and see what was happening around me.

I dont know how long I lay there. The numbness left me, but I still didnt lift my hood. So little light was coming in under my hood that night might have fallen and I wouldnt have been able to tell. A long time later, the rain stopped. A longer time after that, I began to hear again. I heard birds tweeting, cars driving by from what sounded like miles away. I didnt move.

After a long time of only hearing the sounds of nature, I heard footsteps approaching me. They stopped suddenly, and then clearly changed to those of someone running up to me.

Are you alright? An old man whose name I dont remember said as he leaned over and pulled my hood back. I looked up at him, rocks still stabbed into my face. He winced as he saw it. Christ, kid. What happened to you?

I dont know, I said.

I still dont know. I dont want to. I know that Eric, Tony, and Sam were never found, nor was any trace of anything that might have made them disappear. I learned even that reluctantly. Look for answers? Hell, I dont even go near forests any longer.
Staying away from forests isnt enough. I have developed a need for sound. Always. After a minute without the hearing something, I feel anxious. Sleeping without it is impossible. If whatever got my fellow scouts comes for me, I want as much warning as I can get.

That brings me to the reason Im sharing this: Lately, even with music at full volume and me screaming my lungs out, Ive been experiencing minutes of silence. At home, at work, out driving, when Ive gone on visits, Ive been experiencing it.

Its been many years since the the end of my last camping trip, but it seems like Im about to feel that presence again. When it wants, I believe it will make me experience a silence that will never end.

<TITLE> Gym's really awkward </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-31 21:05:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So last night I went to it for the first time in like six months. There were some extremely attractive women there and it's not a big place but since they looked about 19 and I'm 28 (and out of shape) I knew they'd really rather not be leered at by me, and "leering" when you're the creepy old guy means "looking at at all." So for an hour and a half I had to look away from these people in a fairly enclosed space. 

I don't mean to whine "boo hoo, I didn't objectify/gawk at a bunch of strangers!" or that I deserve "nice guy" points. It just becomes really awkward when you get conscious of how there are some people you really want to look at people but know the decent thing would be to not. 

I should go later when the place is cleared out.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I recently learned of the graphically updated Resident Evil game. I know that since then zombies and stuff have become a bit passe and its odd, static third person camera angles clash a bit with modern standards, but to me it still worked really well. Plus I'm sure many of you know about this but I thought the little tweaks to change player expectations on when and how certain actions would happen worked.

So what other games is this being done with? Is Alone in the Dark   supposed to be rumored to be getting anything like this or that sort of thing?  </TEXT>

I frankly don't know how to acquire weed and even if I did I'd be too nervous to get it, so it's not really on the table for me to find out first hand.

Nice subtle pun. 

Anyway, for me, it's cartoons being literally hooked up to pumps, air tanks, whatever, and floating or bouncing around. As ridiculous as it might sound, characters being drawn becoming fat does nothing for me. 

Obviously this is impossible in the real world and when people photoshop it happening to real humans, I personally find it unpleasant but I don't really begrudge them for it.

<TEXT> Seeing it. I assume what happened was during a period when my brain was developing my sex drive while I was really young, I saw it happening in some cartoon and that somehow got mixed in with my impulses. 

But as far as I know, that might be debunked Freudianism.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. I never would think Cracked going "SJW" is one of its problems. I'd say it's real problems is when it reports inaccurately for the sake of clicks. Jason "David Wong" Pargin has numerous articles full of complete bullshit if you actually research them (particularly his private obsession with insisting being overweight is untreatable except through surgery, which his own sources don't condone anymore, or his "Monkeysphere" article.) If a writer reports honestly and gives the facts accurately, it doesn't matter to me what their agenda is. 
2. I assume that was a dig at J. F. Sargent. Well, he was always nice to me but I remember a lot of factual holes being poked in his article about video game prejudices. I haven't read much by him since that I can remember, so I don't know if he does more thorough fact-checking now. 
3. I think Cracked is way better than it used to be.  Much as people get all nostalgic for 2007, that was when Cracked reported straight up horseshit sometimes because they didn't have to cite sources or when Pargin would say a suicide note without a suicide was "gay."  </TEXT>

2. Yes, they often alter written articles. I've had my points about people completely flipped because editorial thought it would fit the tone they wanted better. I would have preferred they just send it back to me with a "do over" note as that would have encouraged me to do more proofreading at a younger age.  </TEXT>

3. Listverse doesn't force in certain prejudices against acceptable targets. The fetish art article above would have had a much more judgmental tone if Cracked had accepted it instead. 
4. As a reader, Listverse puts all its content on one page.

<TEXT> Women drinking when they're looking for casual sex. I am not saying women who have bad experiences as a result of their impaired states deserve anything at all that happens to them but I don't understand why you'd do that in such a risky situation. It just seems to increase the risk of being assaulted, contracting an STD and/or getting impregnated, or having sex with someone you wouldn't want to if you were sober.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm not trying to claim I'm a badass or anything, I just have a thing that if something is going to creep me out, it usually needs to be ugly or aesthetically unpleasant some way or I'll think it looks good. 

For example, I think the images this artist posted (NSFW) http://imgur.com/a/mg9l5 are more beautifully done and awesome than they are creepy. Even this http://i.imgur.com/noEpc2T.jpg is more moody and atmospheric for me than it is cool, but that might be because I used to take walks in the early morning when it was often foggy like that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know and have listened to multiple people who love bad movies in person and through podcasts. They will talk about generally traditionally masculine subjects like sports and the like, but when they talk about bad old movies, they won't shut up about hairstyles. Like if they mention Road House or some bad cult movie from the 1980s, mullets and such will come up. I have heard so much about the rat tail Anakin Skywalker has from people that hate the prequels, 1970s hairstyles for movies from that decade, and so on. I have never heard people talk about this in regards to good movies.

<TEXT> That's the most generic comment I've ever seen on any genre. I've seen this said about anime, comic books, comic book movies, tv shows, folk music, etc. There will always be people who dislike the way things currently are because they don't realize there was lots of forgotten junk in the past and think the past was better because only the classics remain. 

Name any era of horror and there's lots of obscure terrible content that can be pointed to as evidence that at that time people weren't exploring its potential.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know calling us autistic or aspies is something countless people online can't go ten minutes without doing, but this is a sincere questions without malice. /u/ScalSaver noticed some points in a recent thread about the character: 

she doesn't pick up on facial cues quickly, if at all.
but she doesn't quite get that other ponies don't know what she knows (= bad theory of the mind)
She has difficulty understanding what other ponies are thinking.


That seems a pretty reasonable case, whether or not it's intentional. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-12-29 22:54:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My brother insists that Pinkie Pie works better when she's actually a kind of compassionate being. She's supposed to be so desperate for parties and fun because it's the only way she knows to try to make others happy. That's why it's supposed to be so important to her when she gets her cutie mark that her family like her party set up, and that if she only cared so much about candy and stuff she could have just entertained herself. That's also why when no one's around she goes so crazy. 

I argued that it makes her too much of a goody-goody and that she needs to have some selfishness and such. She's also kind of stunted and oblivious at the end of the day, and she'd be less compelling if she's so selfless.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know that cancer is actually many diseases that sort of get lumped into one category. Let's just say one that would be most feasible for a small, underground organization to make.

This is for a story I'm working on in case you're wondering. Profit margin isn't really an issue since the characters involved are driven by ideology. Also the characters are intended to be chemists themselves and thus can steal and bribe to get materials not normally available.

Thanks for your time.

<TEXT> Obviously it barely matters that the characters in MLP are horses, but just around the time I was joining the herd I got a quick gig feeding and watering horses for a family. They really weren't that nice, with only the oldest one being willing to let me pet it at all or anything. 

One thing that stands out in my memory about that gig was one night it got horribly cold, like -7. I lost a bit of sleep worrying about how cold they'd be in their stables. Then I showed up and let them out for their feeding, and one of them started rolling around in the snow. I should have been she was okay, but I remember being pissed that I'd  been worrying about this horse and then it felt like she was unwittingly rubbing in my face what a waste that worry had been.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> How would you recommend adapting this story for a short video? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-27 01:16:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay, I am in talks with the [White with Red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl4kgoeSbNo) director to adapt a short story. It's tentatively entitled "Please God" but that may change. 
[Here's the story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up2JBb_d8GY)

TL:DW: a guy wakes up in a room strapped to a bed. Someone comes in and tortures him purportedly because he was having an affair with the wrong person's wife but actually because this is the torturer's fetish and the tortured person is indulging him because he thought this would be the ultimate act of love. 

So, which of these approaches would you recommend: 

A. Prolonged POV shots (Not a gopro, I think those tend to shake too much to properly simulate vision) to make it more immersive. 

B. With conventional multiple camera setups because then people pay less attention to how the video is being shot and more to the story and acting. 

Thank you for your time.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I understand this is borderline out of the question unless I guess some company thought they could knock out the big names and replace them with their own to make the games essentially long ads. I guess it's more about whether you really need that footage of gameplay to really know how good a game is. 

Personally speaking I've never really just rushed out and bought a game on the basis of a Let's Play video versus a written review or a trailer, but this isn't about me.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Taken from username Cookie Monster's comment on an article about the movie: 

"One more thing that make Star Wars work so well, that only just occur to me for first time, is that it not try and shoehorn in romance. Luke and Han both flirt with Leia, but story never about one of them getting girl. Leaving that storyline to Empire Strikes Back work well, because second installment not have to do as much world-building and have room for romantic subplot. But it also make Leia something other than prize for hero to get at end of movie. When she and Han do get together, they on equal footing, because first movie already establish her as independent person.

They're either explicitly made to be unintelligent and loose or repressed and boring, particularly the ones in Seduction by Design.  I believe I've seen a couple of hers fail the Bechdel test, even.

<TEXT> I was bullshitting with my brother about the show while we were doing an errand and we mentioned the whole "Lyra/Bon Bon" thing. He wondered if you could show like a same sex couple in the show. Not something like it's central to the episode and it becomes a very special episode which would bore the shit out of kids, but they're just there and maybe they've adopted a kid or something. 

On that note, since there are a lot of conservative parents out there that watch the show, are there any controversies like that or was it only the Brony thing that kicked up any dust?  </TEXT>

I saw Sarah and heard her many times before I believed she could be real. She hid in shadows, edges, and in corners of my vision. I would hear walking quietly and cautiously around the house at night--breathing, crawling through the attic, everywhere. Sometimes she would shriek or weep for some time. Everytime I saw her, she was carrying some kind of stuffed animal with her. She was here when I moved into the house. Shell be here as long as the house stands, perhaps longer. 

I know why Sarahs here. I learned about it by reading up on my home at local history at the library. What I read in this old newspapers... well, I had thought I experienced a bad childhood, but compared to hers mine was idyllic. Her father would be revealed by a postmortem to have suffered from a brain tumor at the time when he went mad. His madness drove her mother to leave the home, and he seemed to direct his rage towards his own body and her. She was not allowed to leave the home for her last few days as he became obsessed with a butcher knife. He apparently found many occasions to use it on her and himself. . 

Her life ended in something Ive seen reenacted many times now. On the last night, holding her stuffed bear to give her courage, she walked out into the hallway, a cut on the back of her hand opening as she squeezed it. She went to ask her father to let her leave the house. He must have gotten up and killed her then, because when this part of the haunting happens, she falls on the floor and begins to bleed out. 

I first saw her... reliving this experience that I finally believed she was real. When I saw her walk in to the living room that night, she was not a mere ghost of light or smoke. She was as physical as I was, though I still dont understand how that was possible. She was looking off to my left as she begged her father to let her leave even though I didnt see any sign he was present. 

I let this happen to her once. The second time she came down the hallway to beg the empty air to let her leave. I yelled at her to run but she didnt seem to acknowledge me. When she stopped her plea, which meant her death was imminent. I ran over, picked her up without thinking about the implications of what it meant, and carried her away.

I was expecting what I did to mean nothing: That she would just bleed and die in my arms again. But apparently, somehow, moving the body she had beyond reason from the room prevented her from dying again. I put her down in the bathroom and she was looking up at me, still alright 

I can hardly claim to be her savior, though. Shes still dead. A short time after I carried out of the living room, she still faded away and resumed the same pattern of haunting the house, even the part involving walking into the living room to ask her father to let her leave, as if nothing had happened. Well, almost. 

Just an hour ago, she came into the living room again, looking the same as always and holding a stuffed animal the same as every other time. She looked like she was strangling it. I had moved the chair to where her father must have had his, and she looked me in the eyes as she approached. 
	
Hello, Sarah, I said as I got up. 	

No. Please, no, Sarah begged as I approached. 

Theres no one but me who has to see her. Theres almost no one who would believe this pretty little girl is still on this plane of existence. No wonder I didnt believe she was real. 

How could I be so lucky?

I didn't ever play it as a child, but I was surprised when I looked back on it at how well the graphics of The Curse of Monkey Island held up when I tried them a little while ago. I also liked some of the stuff in King's Quest V more than I would have expected for how primitive it is and for how difficult some of the gameplay can be.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I and a guy in Las Vegas are in preproduction on a short based on this story: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up2JBb_d8GY (with permission from the author)

The TL:DW of it is that the story is about a guy being tortured because he had sex with the wrong guy's wife. 

Now, if it were your job to shoot this, would you take: 


Option A: Shoot it conventionally with closeups, fairly conventional shot lengths, etc. 

Option B: POV shots from the victim's perspective, ideally only two of them if possible. 

I imagine I don't need to go into any details about the pros and cons of each option.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> To my mind "Salad Fingers" was boring as hell because it was badly animated and had some lousy artwork, so it just seemed predictable that he'd go with creepy or whatever since it gave the impression he wouldn't be able to draw anything else. It was that or just have everyone say fuck or do the kind of juvenile humor that would appeal to Newgrounds people.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I work at a library and love the hell out of my job. EXCEPT when I have to work the kid's section, because the books are so skinny and the shelves always so out of order that it takes forever to shelve anything. 

Today we got a big delivery of MLP books. A couple other librarians were talking about it, marveling about how they couldn't keep them on the shelves. One mentioned she saw this thing about how she learned there is non-pony MLP fanart (like when the Mane Six are drawn as donuts or whatever) and wondered aloud what else there might be. I  said "if it's a noun, there's a My Little version of it." And she was quiet for a second and then said "ARE YOU A BRONY!?" I said "not so loud." 

I thought then "Ah ha! Now she'll find me creepy and not let me work in the kid's section, but probably not enough to fire me!" I thought I was free of my least favorite part of my job. Then she said "I love you even more now!" 

Dammit! The ONE time I wanted it to make me look like I shouldn't be around kids!

<TEXT> *The following document was forwarded to me from a person who works with the Minnesota State Hazardous Response Team. The informant said its extracted from a word document that is the only evidence that it was within their power to take from the scene of an unconventional, classified emergency action. The reason the informant gave for sharing this was that it might be in the public interest that word of the emergency be made available before official disclosure.*

*[I've also converted it to audio format for the blind.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzJVdvogLIs)* 

Badum. Badum. Badum. Badum. Badum.

Im typing this in what was a cabin in Cook County, Minnesota. Its forty miles of wilderness to the nearest town and at least ten miles to the nearest other cabin. Youll hear all about the place soon on the news. Or maybe not. I dont mind much either way anymore. Its more likely youll hear some version of what happened to me, eventually. Theres a reason I had to go to a place like this to hide my face while I waited to disappear. Theyll want there to be some version of what happened to me to tell the public.

This started three days ago. The fridge started making a horrible grinding noise, so I got the manual out. There was no phone to call a repairman for it and I dont have a connection to the internet, or I would probably have tried to get in touch with someone a thousand times already during my lonely periods. Anyway, the manual said it was a problem with the vents in the back around the fan getting clogged. I pulled the fridge from the wall, removed the vent cover, and saw that the fan was surrounded with dust and hair. I cleaned it out.
I might not have noticed the moss then, but I was so bored at the time that I decided to clean it much more thoroughly than necessary. I felt along the bottom of the metal frame housing the fan and then recoiled. I thought Id electrocuted myself for a second, but I knew that what Id felt was not electricity from past experience with hotwiring.

I felt it again. It was smooth, warm, and soft. It was quite similar to human flesh. And there was something else about the thing I felt down there that differentiated it from any known mold.

There was a pulse like you can feel at someones neck or wrist. Id felt pulses enough back in the day that it was the first place my mind went when I felt that sensation. And along with it, I felt a very light spray emit from it, like if you squirted cologne on yourself from way too far away.

I tried to tear it out and get a look at it, but it was too firmly attached. Frustrated, I went and got some drain cleaner which dissolved the patch quickly. When I cleaned out the remnants it a red sludge. It was just like the leftovers from when I and my associates used lye on a body.

Like many things in my life I was able to rationalize that pretty easily. There were probably plenty of molds I wouldnt recognize. I knew I had seen red funguses somewhere on television or something. The pulse could have been my own. If you use your thumb when taking someones pulse, youll end up feeling your own. I convinced myself Id felt something similar to that.

Badum. Badum. Badum. Badum. Badum.

Taking off the gloves after the last of the sludge went down the sink, I realized I hadnt washed my hand before putting on the glove after I felt that faint spray. I absent-mindedly sniffed it weakly. It smelled surprisingly good. Like chocolate and flowers. Of course I washed it off, but I was surprised at the time that it smelled so nice. In fact, I felt a little happier than I would have expected after washing it off.

Early the next morning, when there was just enough light to make the inside of my cabin a dark blue, I heard the fan for the fridge again make a horrible grinding noise. I stumbled out of bed, pulled the fridge away from the wall again, unplugged it, and then I froze. I could smell chocolate and flowers.

I thought I might have been smelling things and maybe seeing things through bleary eyes. A glass of water sounded like what I needed to clear my head. I drank half a glass then poured the rest out. Although I couldnt see into the sink properly in the weak light, I realized there was no gurgle of the water draining.
I turned on the light above the sink and saw it.

There was a mass that had grown out of the drain. It was slowly, rhythmically expanding and contracting slightly like it was breathing. A large blue vein was visible, straining against the skin.

I bent down to get the drain cleaner. My hands were trembling as I tried to unscrew the lid. Even then, I knew it was useless. What I had done yesterday had merely left this thing to regrow in the u-pipe or somewhere. Surely pouring more drain cleaner onto an even greater mass would hardly stop the growth. But it was all I could think to do at the moment.

As I poured a bit of drain cleaner onto the moss, its surface spasmed. It released a powerful spray of whatever that scent was. I couldnt force myself to keep pouring. I was became fully relaxed even as I stood there trying to kill some being of skin. The moss gradually stopped spasming even as the drain cleaner slowly stopped eating through it. It seemed, at least to me, like it was relaxing too. It released more of that wonderful scent.

Badum. Badum. Badum. Badum.

Its okay. I understand. Im not mad at you. Thats what it felt like it was trying to communicate to me. Even then I knew I should have tried to tear out the plumbing or leave the cabin for somewhere else on foot, but I wanted more of that scent. I felt the best I had since Id started hiding up here.

I stood over the sink for a while, just breathing in that odor. I could no longer care what was in that spray which calmed me so. I looked over at the fridge vent. I could see little bits of the flesh moss growing out through the vents.

Since then, the moss grew and grew faster as it went. It now coats the inside of the cabin like soundproofing, For how loud it is, the sound of the mosss pulse is very relaxing, like the nature sounds people play to help them sleep. Its the badum sound Ive found myself typing a few times as I write this. I imitate the sound with my mouth as I do.

Acid is beginning to leak from large pores on this flesh moss. Its not strong enough to eat through metal but anything organic that it touches is being dissolved. The soles of my boots are almost gone now. I can feel the skin on the bottom of my feet beginning to be eaten away as well. But what matters most is that the moss has continued to spray that wonderful scent even as it releases acid. Im in pain, yet I dont mind.

The mosss pulse is speeding up. I think it wants to digest me faster. I am considering lying down in the acid to help speed it along. Its the least I could do for it.

Badum, badum, badum badum badum badum badumbadumbadumbadumbadumba

<TEXT> Moments in movies where a camera movement or the way a scene was lit  made you laugh. 

One moment that comes to mind for me was Tropic Thunder.

SPOILERS

Ben Stiller's character is taken hostage and forced to sort of perform as his character Simple Jack. He is put in a humiliating outfit and constantly beaten to do so. When his rescuers arrive, he says he doesn't want to leave because he's finally found his audience. When he says that, there's a shot of him where there's a light on his face that makes him look kind of movie menacing. It was hilarious to me the contrast between his slapstick treatment and how now he was feeling empowered and menacing.  </TEXT>

I must have bought way too much into the idea that the dad was neglectful, because there's a scene where Schwarzenegger has to pick his kid from out of a crowd to give him a toy, and I seriously worried "Oh no, is Schwarzenegger going to be able to remember his kid's *name*?!" That or I was weird as hell.   </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-10-09 00:20:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I really didn't get that. Isn't that going to make them enormously more expensive and risky, going to clash with your expectations, make it harder to sell the special effects, etc. When your target audience is usually kids or nostalgic adults anyway, wouldn't you assume they'd prefer the look of a cartoon if the cartoons became classics anyway? 

Sure, it paid off a few times like when movies like George of the Jungle became hits, but it seems like the risks and bombs would outweigh that.  

EDIT: I mean, why, if you're going to reboot a franchise, would you adapt it live action instead of as a cartoon? I should have clarified that more. I certainly get the nostalgia aspect.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-10-01 23:53:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ive been an atheist for a long time, and I spent a long time trying to get my mother to see the light. She never seemed to pass up an opportunity to buy a new book or dvd by Joyce Meyer or some other self-help huckster who would tell her what she wanted to hear about needing to stop worrying and put her faith in God. I tried to convince her that God as a concept was irrational, that her religion was built on lies and bad ethics.
 
That stopped yesterday. 

Mom called me up out of the blue and pleaded for me to come over. When I arrived, I let myself in and saw she had taken everything Christian she owned, from bibles to plates with The Last Supper on them, broken it all, and assembled it all into a cross in the middle of the living room. There was blood drying on some of the broken glass. 

Mom, what is this?! . 

Dustin, she called from her bedroom, I need you to pray! I was getting out my phone to get an ambulance while jogging to her bedroom. The door was locked. 

Unlock this door, Mother! 

Pray!  Really, truly, pray! She screeched at me. I paused and whispered a prayer that Mom be okay. I have never regretted doing anything more in my life. I have never felt secure, alone, or hopeful since then.

There was a voice that reverberated from inside my head while I stood outside her room.

<TEXT> A. A Christian is drowning in the sea. A boat comes up the crew tries to save them, but he says "no, God will save me!" Later another boat comes up and tries to save him again, but he insists that God will save him. Later a third boat comes along. The Christian is wheezing, gasping, almost exhausted, but manages to wheeze out "no, God will save me!" Then he drowns. In Heaven, he asks God why he didn't save him. God says "I sent you three boats!" 

B. An atheist is drowning in the sea. Getting desperate, he says to himself "Okay, God, I know I've never believed in you before, but if you save me, I'll not only become a believer, I'll become the best believer. I'll go to church, do my best to never sin. Please save me." Then a boat suddenly appears out of nowhere with a crew getting their life saving equipment ready. The atheist says "Never mind, God: I got this!"  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I finally saw this film and I couldn't believe how forced and overwritten some of the dialogue was. Like "fuck me gently with a chainsaw" roles terribly off the character's tongue when just "fuck me gently" would have been so much more natural and quotable. 

Did the screenwriter ever claim that the dialogue was supposed to be like some sort of satire of kids trying to sound cool? Is there any indication the lines were supposed to be legitimately cool? Dean is clearly supposed to be a deconstruction of the idea of being cool and edgy, so I thought the idea was kinda legit.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You must not have actually read it. 

"Tusk has a lot going for it. Michael Parks has a knack for making Smiths overwritten speeches sound like prose-poems, and Smith doesnt squander that assethe lets Howes long, winding stories anchor the movie. And that Mr. Tusk costume is genuinely horrific, with bloody scars and a general ungainliness that makes the Wallace-walrus look like hes in excruciating discomfort. (Theres a scene about three-quarters of the way through Tusk where Howe forces the man-beast to learn how to swim, and the combination of Wallaces panic and what he finds beneath the water is as terrifying as anything a veteran horror director couldve staged.) Tusk also has some subtle touches that speak to Smiths personality"

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When I opened my eyes in that cabin and I felt the straps on my arms, legs, and across my torso holding me fast to the bed with a tarp beneath me, you better believe I was praying to God for help. It was a one-room building with paneled walls and a musty smell. I must have been where whoever brought me there was sure no one could hear anything that would happen. In the far upper corners there were ceiling mounted cameras aimed at me, red lights on. Along the far wall there was a table with a green plastic sheet over it. There were the tips of instrument handles visible on the table. 

I struggled against the restraints, barely able to move my hands and feet. I screamed and struggled for what had to be at least a minute. I stopped only at the sight of the door opening.

A man stood in the doorway. He was six feet tall at least, fit as an ox, and a little bored. He wore a surgical apron. When I saw that, I began screaming again. He didnt respond as I alternately begged him for mercy and threatened him. He went over to a laptop the cameras were connected to and made some adjustments. He walked over to my side then.

Shut up! he yelled at me, his tone more annoyed and exhausted than angry. I complied.

Okay, checking, checking, audio test, he said. He went back to the laptop and played back what hed just recorded. After a nod of satisfaction, he picked up a piece of paper from next to the laptop. He looked from the paper to me as he read.

Hello from the husband you fucked along with her, he read robotically. 

E-Ellen? I said weakly. Is this about Ellen? But she said that- He looked up at me and I stopped speaking again. He shook his head slightly and continued.

Did the bitch even tell you about me? Are you still hoping youre gonna escape? You still thinking the man who strapped you down is just gonna scare you? Ive seen too much of you with her to ever let you live. Youre gonna die really slowly. Were are gonna watch everything. Youre not the first other man to stick his cock in her but you will be the last. He sighed, crumpled up the paper, and tossed it on one of the tables as he made for the instruments hed laid out.

Without so much as another glance at my face, he came over to me with a scalpel. He spread my largest and second toe on my left foot, and began to cut the webbing. I had never experienced anything like that before and showed no strength in the face of it. I shrieked like an animal.

Make him stop, I thought. Please God, make him stop.

He seemed finished with my left foot and made for my right hand. I tried to clench it into a fist but that did nothing to slow him down. He went for the flesh between my ring and pinkie finger and began to cut. I was dimly aware of mucus touching my lips as I tried to scream.

He stopped after an eternity and stepped back, breathing heavily. I faintly heard the sound of him peeling off his gloves. I begged him to not to continue while he got on two replacement pairs of gloves without acknowledging what I had to say.

He came back to me with a surgical retractor in one hand and the scalpel in the other. He grabbed a section of my lip below the nose in the retractor and pulled it. He pressed the blade of the scalpel against my lip and began to cut.

I couldnt take any more. I hoped hed forgive me.

Medulla! I screeched as loud as I could. Immediately he stopped. He went back to the table hed kept his instruments on.

Okay, hang in there, Joe. Itll be over soon! Ive got the tetracaine ready! Almost immediately after he took away the pain, he got out the kit to give me the stitches. While he was doing that, I actually fell asleep from sheer exhaustion. 

*	*	*

So now Im at our home. Hes downstairs doing the laundry, insisting on doing all the chores now. I dont think Ill be able to walk properly for a few days, but we have our story for how I got injured like this for our coworkers. He has all the written and video evidence he would need to show that it was consensual and that he respected the safety word in case I decide to go to the police or anything. Not that I would do that. 

He told me he was more than satisfied with what wed done. He really liked the little bit Id come up with about Ellen. Thats left me pretty satisfied too. Anything for him. I love him so much. I should have let him go farther. Next time Im sure I will. It wont be for some time of course. 

He's got a partner that will let him live out his fantasies. He didn't dare tell any of his old lovers about this fetish. He didn't hesitate to stop when I said the word. He loves me.

I know this goes far beyond a normal S M relationship, but it doesnt matter. He's never going to do this to anyone else. Not to someone who doesn't know the safety word. He's definitely never going to just keep going until I can't say the word. He loves me.

I haven't just given him a taste. I haven't made him want to go farther so much he won't be able to stop next time. He loves me. Hes not going to cut anyone else. Please God, hes not.

Please, oh please God.

<TEXT> No, it's really mostly obvious bullshit. Accomplishments and skills do not make people [inherently happier](http://www.nj.com/parenting/index.ssf/2014/08/post_42.html) so your pie in the sky hopes that all you have to do is get a job with specialized skills or a promotion so you can fuck someone and its all better. That metaphor of how being a "nice person" is useless is obviously Pargin justifying his own and other people's dickishness based on professional desirability. Creating stuff often doesn't "increase your value as a human being" most of the time because many of us don't have the means to make our products do anything or share them with significant numbers of people or have a significant impact on those we can reach.    

I think people are overly impressed by this article because he isn't offering easy answers, but he's still offering simple answers that aren't true. Read his article about stuff you don't learn in school and he blatantly admits in there that he lucked into the position at Cracked that compels anyone to pay attention to him.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Silent Zombie Comedy? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-28 01:21:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've had this idea for the past few days and I wanted to know what you guys around here would think of it. I don't know if it would benefit from actually being shot like a silent film. 

The premise would be that some modern equivalent to Charlie Chaplin's Tramp character would be in a zombie outbreak, more or less going about his usual business by basically dodging zombie hordes through a series of improvised setups and gymnastic abilities. One day he runs into a female survivalist who is the last of her group. He becomes smitten with her and imagines her as a delicate flower despite her in reality being tough and completely uninterested in him except for he knows how to get where she wants to go safely. As they make their way there, she insists on killing zombies (sometimes gratuitously) but he is completely abhorrent of the idea, arguing that some day they might be cured. 

That's all I've got in mind for the story right now. I just wanted to see the reaction around here to it.  </TEXT>

The overlap is incomprehensible. I'm sure someone will claim it's like being a fan of this show, but it's really not. It would be like if Pinkie Pie squealed incoherently for nine minutes out of every episode and the camerawork was swooshy and swirly and practically meant to be headache inducing. 

Edit: Judging by the feedback, it's not a Brony thing but a Facebook thing. Cool. Thanks for your time!   </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-08-12 01:06:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There was a copy of one of the Swamp Thing comic books at my library. In it there's a page showing the many ways an evil force's power is supposed to be infecting and corrupting the world. One of the images in it was a couple little girls putting their kitten in the microwave and being just about to start it. 

Someone had taken a pen and just scribbled out that panel, but you could still see what was happening. It was the only panel they had done that for even though others featured people and other animals being murdered. I was bewildered that apparently someone out there was the kind of person who would react that way to the though of a kitten being killed but would still read overtly horrific comic books and get that far into it. 

I've also seen a few Stephen King books with pentagrams drawn in them, but that just seemed like kids messing around.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Was a wild deer playing with/attacking me? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-04 22:21:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Last night I went on a walk through the local park. At one point there was a  clearing with a fawn on it. It sprinted away as I approached by the path took a turn so I started to walk away and it stopped when it became obvious I wasn't approach it. Then it started to gallop after me. I thought this was kind of weird so I just sort of yelled "Hey!" when it was only like two feet from me and it stopped. I looked past it and saw that its mother had showed up and was eyeing me. After staring at me walking away a few more seconds, and turned and galloped in another random direction. 

I certainly knew better than to touch a wild deer, but is it likely that fawn was going to do anything to me if I hadn't yelled something? Like, I don't know, bump into me or bite me or some territorial "playful" thing?  </TEXT>

"Look, I got plenty of troubles at home and at work. The only time I can relax is on the bus. You think I want to read stories like 'Synagogues Vandalized Again' or 'Property of Jews seized?' Not when I can read the Nazi newspapers and see 'Jews Take Over the Banks!' or 'Jews Take Over the Universities!' That's *me* they're talking about!"

<TITLE> Which of these stories would you prefer be made into a game? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-26 22:36:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was going to make a fairly crude MLP game with 2d sprite graphics (hired out, I'm well aware of my limitations as an artist and a bit overpaid.) Which of these stories sounds like a more interesting game: 

A. Twilight and the others of the Mane Six experiment with a spell Twilight Sparkle found in the archives to make them "more their cutie marks." Instead of making them better at those things, they end up literally turning into those things (Applejack becomes a pony made of apple, Rarity becomes a crystal statue, etc.) Fortunately Twilight had a book of cures on hand if something went wrong. 

So the games are really minigames where you try to cure the ponies of their different states, with different levels of difficulty and different reactions from the ponies (i.e. Rainbow Dash could think it's awesome that she's a pony made of rainbow-colored lightning with a mane and tail of cloud and would try to avoid being cured.)  

B. The Princesses decide to let the changelings into Equestria under close supervision to bring about peace between the two cultures. The idea seems to be going as well as could be expected at first (like a few changelings can't help but try to pass themselves off as ponies, but they get rooted out quickly.) Then Queen Chrysalis of all ponies reports that there seems to be an epidemic of it happening that she can't control. It's up to the player to get to the bottom of whether the changelings are really innocent, under something else's control, if it can be made to work, etc. 

I'm loosely planning that it would be a matter of trivia games to sort out who's real and not and a point-and-click beyond that. 


Thanks for your time!   </TEXT>

<TITLE> I'd never hallucinated before. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-30 17:37:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I had never hallucinated in my life before this. Ive rarely gone a night without sleep, Ive never had a recreational drug stronger than a cappuccino. Im not ill in anyway that Im aware of. The most severely Ive ever been medicated is when I got prescribed zoloft my freshman year at Pescadero High for about two weeks for mild obsessive compulsive disorder. Believe me, Ive gotten a second and third opinion from psychiatrists and neurologists and theres nothing wrong me. Nothing they can find, anyway. 

It was a night three weeks ago. The moon was full enough that places without any street or house lights were dark blue instead of pitch black except for in the shadows when I biked to Moms. I always biked to her place because it helped reinforce the impression that I was trying to get in shape. 

The layout between my Mothers place and my apartment is like this: her place, then down main street for a bit, then turn left into the dog park, up the big hill in the dog park, into the apartment complexes, through the smaller park, theres the post office, go along the beach path for a few hundred meters, then Im home.  

Everything was unusually pleasant as I started riding from the home and down main street. I remember that I checked for my cell phone only to find it wasnt there. I recalled then that Id left it to recharge in my kitchen then and felt dumb for not taking it with me to recharge at Moms.  

When I reached the dog park, I made my usual try at surmounting the hill, but as I said, Im not in shape and about a third of the way up I switched to walking the bicycle up its main trail on my route. That trail is surrounded by thick undergrowth and really pretty underlit, with just a single lamppost lighting it. Out of nowhere I heard growling in the undergrowth. I barely had time to look back and to my left to see a dog come sprinting onto the path. It was a German Sheperd breed and the most furious animal Ive ever seen. Its ears were flat and its fangs were bared and dripping, as if it was attacking out of hunger instead of just anger. It was on me in a second.   

I was extremely lucky and apparently the dog was extremely stupid. When it leapt up at me, it got caught on the bike that I had been walking. Its jaw snapped close enough to me that a gob of its saliva landed on my shirt but it didn't injure me. I was just barely able to keep the bike upright so it stayed. Before it had a chance to back up and try for me again, I heard someone yelling "No!" in a scolding tone. A huge guy, at least a foot taller than me, grabbed the dog by the collar and pulled it away. He still seemed to struggle for a few seconds but then the dog sat and just growled and snarled at me. 

As I processed what had just happened and then got a hold of myself, I saw that the man that had just gotten the dog under control was just staring at me. No look of worry that his dog had just attacked someone, no apologies, nothing but a blank stare at me as his dog growled between his legs. I waited a moment for him to say something or at least move. 

Control your goddam dog! I told him just to break the silence. He didnt respond, although his dog barked stood again and tried to charge at me, but the owner held it strong. I climbed back on the bike and strained my way up the hill, not wanting to look too weak to pedal the bike in front of the guy Id just yelled at. 

After something like that, I was on the lookout for stuff as I pedaled out of the dog park and into the apartment complexes. There was no one out walking but plenty of cars and trucks driving by. Everything felt normal, pleasant even, but of course I was still a bit shaken. I think I felt lucky for a few seconds there that I hadnt pissed my pants when the dog attacked.

As I pedalled past the first apartment building in the complex, I saw the first person Id seen just out walking that evening. It was a woman of roughly thirty with very deeply tanned skin and wearing one of those Islamic headscarves. Her eyes were very, very wide and her movements were unnaturally stiff. She looked at me as I approached her as if she thought I might be about to attack. 

Feeling both still a little paranoid but emasculated I stopped and dismounted. 

Maam, are you alright? I asked, thoughtlessly walking up to her, probably exactly wrong for approaching a scared person. 

Oh, yes yes! she insisted with a rapid nods while backing away from me, making a big phony smile. 

Are you sure? I said dully. 

Yeah. Im fine. Thank you for asking. As she said that, she began to walk forward again, giving me a wide berth. When she passed me she turned her head round to look at me, her smile gone and her eyes still wide. When she did, her eyes... they seemed to elongate across her face. Her left eye seemed to curve up and around her temple and her right extended down and around her cheek, both the whites of her eyes and the pupils and irises with them. I would have just thought I was misinterpreting what I was seeing, but when the left eye elongated up to her head scarf, it went under it instead of being superimposed over it as I would have thought in a hallucination, She paused as this happened, letting me have a good long look at what I thought I was seeing. Much longer than I would have wanted. Then she turned and continued her awkward walk, looking normal from the back. 

I didnt know what to do for a moment. Should I just run up and try to see her eyes again? As I said earlier, Id never hallucinated before. I felt lucid if extremely uneasy then. I decided to just keep going on my errand and then go home. I guess I wanted to continue thinking that it was an anomaly with my vision and that everything was normal. 

I started biking past the apartments. Despite my apparent desire to continue as if things were normal, I was looking all around me for something else out of the ordinary. This unfortunately caused me to look in some of the apartment windows. Most of them had their blinds or their curtains shut, but every once in awhile there was one I could see inside. As unpleasant as it might sound, I looked into each one I could as I rode by. 

I went by several open windows with nothing out of the ordinary happening in them, but something I think I saw in one window made me slow down. It was hard to describe, but I thought I saw two people that seemed to be standing back to back for some reason. But when I stopped and went back a little, I saw that the two were doing what looked like a regular dance of some kind, probably practice for some show. I dont know. I got going again, feeling like I was letting my wil imagination convince me to do some skeevy things. I tried to stop myself from looking into the next open window to give the whoever might be in there privacy. What I saw instead made me squeeze my brakes with a death grip. 

There was an old, heavy man sitting on a couch. I remember he was wearing a white undershirt. Other than that, all I had time to see was what he was doing: He was cutting his face with what looked from the way he was holding it like an exacto-blade. He would push it against his cheek, chin, nose, forehead, twitch his hand and leave a cut, then slowly move the knife to another part of his face for another cut. He was looking off to his left with a contented expression while he did this like someone watching television without any particular interest. 

I watched him do this for what felt like minutes on end but was probably less than half a minute. I remember twitching a couple times looking at this from how painful it looked. I have no recollection of having ever seen anything like that before. I was becoming sick to my stomach at the sight of his cuts and the blood dripping down his face and staining his undershirt. And I tried, but I couldnt convince myself I was hallucinating. 

Out of nowhere, he turned and looked at me. He glared and made to get up, his blade still in his hand. I imagined he had to be getting up to come after me. I must have unconsciously lowered my feet to the ground, but I tried to lift my feet to the pedals. In my desperation to get out of there, I missed the pedals. I looked down, this time, and got a trembling left foot on the pedal. I looked back at the window to see if he was coming for me. 

There was no sign of him. I hesitated for a second then. He might have been behind the door, about to get outside only a few steps from me. But I decided then that even if I was seeing things, I would need to call the police when I got home. Even if I was seeing something, there was a possibility there was in a man in that apartment that was on...I dont know. PCP, maybe. Or at least was a chance I was watching disturbed man hurt himself. So I looked quickly for the apartment number, which was 204, and then biked away. I didnt hear the sound of any doors opening or any feet pounding for awhile, so by around the time I got out of the apartment complex I felt safer. 

That feeling did not last. There was nothing down Main Street that was out of the ordinary, so I think I slightly convinced myself Id just been seeing things again. Not enough that I didnt start to work through in my head what I would say to the police when I called. But when I reached the small park that would lead to the post office before the beach trail that went home, it happened. 

I heard the rapid tapping sound of footsteps behind me. I looked behind me. Empty street, but I definitely could hear that sound. Then I heard a growling and snarling noise. I didnt see it, but I thought for sure that it was that same dog from the hill. Itd broken free from its strange owner and had tracked me down and was coming after me, still not visible even in the light of the full moon. 

I started pedalling as fast as I could. The Veterans Park didnt have any hills like the earlier one, but that dog still seemed to be gaining on me. It was barking and snarling like it had lost its mind as it seemed to be going faster than me even as I put my back into it. I stood up on the pedals but the sound of snarls and growls just seemed to get louder. 

I looked back behind me, and there was still no dog to be seen. It was only feet behind me now from the sound and getting louder. I remember for some reason why, after seeing those strange things earlier today, am I only hearing this goddamned dog? Still looking behind me I heard the sound of what seemed to be a dog jumping forward and the growling coming right at my face.

I dont know if my bike hit something or what happened exactly, but I found myself falling over and hitting the ground hard, my ears full of the sound of a dog attacking me. The snarls and growls made become so loud now that they hurt to hear. They were accompanied now by the sound of skin-tearing and gnawing, as if the dog somehow had my entire head inside its jaws, like it was killing me. I could open my eyes and see there was no dog, I could feel my cheeks and know there were no teeth sunk into them, that certainly the dogs jaws wouldnt fit over my head. But I still thrashed around and screamed on the ground and held my ears as tightly as I could from how painfully loud it was. I dont know how long I heard that dog attacking me, but I remember how it stopped perfectly. Instead of just stopping like youd imagine a hallucination to, I heard the sound of a dogs paws as it backed away. panted and lipped its lips, then sprinted away. 

I felt around my head again, checking once more for blood. I wasnt injured, of course, save a bruise on my leg and elbow. But I checked it again before I tried to get my leg out from under the bike and sit up. It was dead quiet for awhile as I caught my breath and tried to get my nerves back under control. When I finally climbed back on my bike, I was trembling so hard that I immediately almost lost my balance. But slowly, awkwardly I got out of the park and continued pedaling home. Naturally I completely forgot to drop off the dvd at the post office. 

I was on the beach path that leads to my apartment. It was still really bright for the dead of night. I mention that because theres sort of a beach of rocks about the size of office chairs that goes on for hundreds of yards between my apartment and the post office, and it was bright enough that I could see all the individual rocks. And I could really well make out what was in the rocks. 

It was a little girl, like not a toddler but not quite at adolescence, that looked like she was in a floral print dress. She seemed to be just sort of climbing from rock to rock and her hands and feet. I was afraid and not sure what I was seeing anymore, or i probably would have called to her and asked who let her play in a hazardous place at an hour like this. As it was I was I didnt even want to look at her. I told myself she probably was taught not to talk to strangers or that she wasnt real to justify not so much as talking to her. When I glanced over and saw that she was waving at me, I turned away quickly.

HI! she yelled at me in that kind of insincere but chipper way kids do. I didnt acknowledge her. I was looking forward at my apartment. It was a deep bluish gray in the moonlight and it had never looked so much like home. 

I heard her scream. It was not the sound of a kid yelling out of excitement or just for attention. It was a sound that was choked at the end. Something cut her breathing off violently and awkwardly. But I knew with the disturbed way my imagination was going at the time that I did not want to look over at what I was imagining was happening.

Helpfff! she screamed, something obviously muffling her ability speak. I wasnt 	going to look. I heard something like a hideous collision against rock, a sound with a crunch like something was being broken and skin was being torn. I kept my eyes on home. My imagination wasnt going to hit me with some vision. Then I heard the voice sound as if she were lifting high into the air as she continued her muffled begging for help. I guess it seemed to me that such a thing couldnt look real, that it would probably look ridiculous. Whatever it was, my curiosity compelled me to look up where the sound was coming from. 

What I saw was a puff of blackness against a cloud brightly lit by the moon. The blackness quickly dissipated as the scream abruptly ended. I was faintly aware of two objects falling to the rocks below. I couldnt make out what they were at all, but I had a feeling they were the worst part of all that had happened so far. That of all the things that Id looked at that night, those would two fallen objects were what I would most regret seeing. 

When I got home, I called the police immediately about the man in the apartment, assuming it was the thing that would be most likely to be believed. When they asked me if there was anything else they should know, I bit my lip and admitted that I had seen a little unsupervised little girl on the rocks near my apartment. That was all I felt there was to tell. I didnt sleep that night but I forced myself to stay in bed with my eyes shut, not wanting to see if my imagination had something else in mind. 

The next day, the police called. They wanted me to come in for questioning. What I learned down at the station was that there was nothing suspicious reported in Room 204, there was something of interest found on the beach. A girls clothes matching the floral print I had described were found along with socks, a shoe. A few questions later, they mentioned that they also found blood with bits of skin in it. I wasnt about to mention the things I heard and the small but unbelievable thing I saw, and I think I could tell from their body language that the police didnt believe me but they hadnt found any evidence that implicated me. So now Im under suspicion for the things I saw and the things I reported. But thats far from the worst part. 

When I started this, I mentioned that I had never hallucinated before that night. Well, now I do, and I know I am. Ive seen my eyes twist around my face in the mirror but felt my face and realized its normal. Ive heard that dog growling around and chewing my head when Ive tried to sleep. Ive seen that girl again, though from a distance every time since I dont know what she looked like. I see the man with his face still bleeding through apartment windows. I had gaps between seeing and hearing them that were long enough in the first two weeks that I occasionally had hopes the sight and sound of them was gone, but in the third week its become constant enough that I know thats not going away on its own. 

So thats why Im posting this online. If you know anything about any of this, who that person in that apartment might have been, who that girl was, any of this, let me know. I havent slept in days and I havent had much peace. What the truth is seems less and less important as time goes on. I just, I need to know why I saw what I saw during that night ride.
