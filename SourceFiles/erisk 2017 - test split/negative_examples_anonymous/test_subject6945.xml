<TEXT> No chance. I went to the last rally more so as a spectator, and the behavior on both sides of the rally was disgusting. 

I saw counter protesters assaulting and spitting on people.  

I also saw the reclaim Australia people screaming racial slurs and trying to intimidate people in smaller groups. 

Honestly it was an embarrassment to say the least. Both sides should be ashamed of themselves. Neither were proving anything except that people are arseholes no matter what side of the argument they are on.       </TEXT>

Anyway i snuggle up to my sleeping partner and try to wake her with a gentle grind.. After about 2 minutes i hear a faint meow. I lift my leg and look under the blanket to see my poor indy with a horrified look on her face. 

Poor little fucker.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, so around three weeks ago my partner and i moved into our first home that we have brought. 

Tonight i used the ovan for the first time  and to my suprise it doesnt work. Turns on but does not heat hup. Took 3 hours to heat up frozen pasties. not cook, just warm them slightly. 

Anyway, does this land back on the original vendor or realestate agent? Or am i boned? 

Cheers in advance.

Edit: Thanks heaps guys. Ill try my luck with the agent tomorrow otherwise ill cop it. Hopefully its not something major! It's been so long without a roast dinner :(  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know this will get burried but fuck it

I wad standing in the waiting room outside of the operating room while my partner was being preped for her C section.

It was abit suddern, the baby was breached, waters had broken so she was rushed into surgery 

I was given scrubs to change into so i could go in and be with my partner, but the 10 minutes i was waiting in this hospital ward with absolutly no one around ( it was 5am) was the most scared i had ever been. I had shit going through my head at a million miles an hour. 

But once they pulled him out and i heard that tiny little cry and saw him look at me everything just washed away. No more fear, no more worries. It was just him.  </TEXT>

Please just remove the battery and don't touch anything untill you do. Expecially  with mechanical mods as you have no way of knowing  whats happening.

<DATE> 2015-01-12 04:22:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi, 

i have a few [juices here from VE](http://i.imgur.com/C6smCER.jpg) that iv mixed to 3mg, I'm not too fond of them and no one i know really likes them so i just wanted to see what i can get for them.
 


I have some Grandpa Joes - 40ml

Caramelised  tobacco - 30ml

Watermelon Slush - 15 ml

Ghost blaster - 12ml

Death by guava - 28 ml 

Cinnamon cookie - 13ml 

All measurements are guess's but i think they are accurate enough.

Please don't mind the labels on a few of the bottles, i tried steeping in a slow cooker on the keep warm setting which worked like a charm but the bag i put them in had a hole which damaged the labels.   

If there is anything you like let me know, i live in Melbourne and would rather meet up to trade but if thats not an option shipping can be arranged. 

Cheers. 

Edit - I'm not too fussed on what i get for these, i cut my losses long ago and am just clearing out, ill take any sort of juice that tickles my fancy (3mg preferred) just let me know what you have :)    </TEXT>

So here I am, relaxing and enjoying the view for about half an hour when I look around and realise the reason I have such an awesome view is because im at the highest point in a 2 km radius.

 Yep, sitting on top of a huge metal frame thats supporting this tank, in a fucking lightning storm. 

Now i don't exactly know,  but that could be considered pretty fucking stupid.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> http://www.gofundme.com/flrd1k
 
This is my mum, she has not been dealt the greatest cards in life. Although she worked her arse off as a single parent working her way through university while raising 3 kids.

 Her passion in life was nursing and was on her way to becoming a midwife. It was all taken away from her due to a debilitating injury at work that left her unable to go on with her career. After the accident and unavoidable surgeries that followed, she was left with a difficult battle with depression and other medical issues that really impacted negatively on her way of life. 

Now because of her previous qualifications (which are now usless to her) she is unable to qualify for government funding or assistance to help pay for a course to be able to return to work and generally improve her life. 

She was always worked so hard and selflessly for my siblings and I and I just want her to be able to do that. So please, if you could take a minute to have a look and help an amazing person out of a shitty situation. 

Thanks </TEXT>

All shops iv worked in have supplied them but its hard to keep track of the condition of the tools when everyone else is using them too. Also a dial indicator and base. Very easy for them to be damaged and no one says anything, potentially causing you trouble down the track.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It still is pretty common. I lost a friend of the family recently to dravet syndrome, she was only 11 and basically minutes after she passed there were photographers there who work for the hospital and asked the mother if she would like some photos taken, she said yes, and a few of them were actually used at her funeral.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Basically I'm interested in having a session in a sensory deprivation tank, and would like to know if anyone here who has done it in or around Melbourne and could suggest somewhere to do it? After a quick google search most of the stuff I have found is for myotherapy and pain relief sort of thing, not sure if they would cater for someone looking to chill out.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> struggling to find a suitable FIFO job in the mining sector. anyone have some advice?  </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-04-21 02:46:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> as the title explains I'm struggling to find a suitable FIFO job in the mining sector. 

I am a qualified fitter and machinest with a wide variety of experience, but I'm having trouble finding work in the mines. 

mainly due to the fact I'm unsure of where to start looking, Iv tried all the main job search sites but can't seem to find anything suitable or within my qualifications, most jobs Iv found have been for high up supervisor jobs and such, and seeing as Iv only been qualified for 7 months I doubt I will have any luck with a job like that. 

all I have been hearing about is this "mining boom" where so many people are getting these amazingly high paid jobs, but I can't find them! 

so if any of you have any advice on how I can get my foot in the door I would really appreciate it! :)
