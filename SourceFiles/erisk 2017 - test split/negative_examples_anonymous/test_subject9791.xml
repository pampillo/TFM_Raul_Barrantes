<TEXT> It's also a TV Channel in Malaysia costing RM10.60 (2.80 US Dollar)

The cheaper price means that you don't have the VOD option and you are stuck with what they show on the network

http://www.astro.com.my/whats-on/channel/wwe-network-hd/285

As you can see, they are just looping 3 or 4 shows a week. But since  the PPV is cheap (it cost around USD10 before this, so it's now 5x cheaper I just buy it for the PPV) </TEXT>

<TEXT> On something different, but quite similarly weird when talking about modern F1, Benneton and Schumacher tested an all wheel steering F1 car, where the rear tyres angles inwards when the front tyres is steering.

In theory it should mean the car is more steerable. In practice, it was not faster than a normal car. The system was ditched and the FIA promptly banned it (only two front tyres can steer the car rule)

Found the article: http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2007/03/22/banned-four-wheel-steering/ </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-07-15 06:49:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Everytime Cena is on commentary, it bores me. He has this calm, droning voice that never changes no matter what happens in the ring. He tries to get people over, but for some reason his timing is off and he cuts off other commentators and tend to talk over them. 

Last night during the triple threat match it was really annoying to hear him. Thank god the match itself is good that he was easily filtered out

There are people like William Regal, that is calm on commentary but makes it work. He managed to convey enthusiasm and character in his commentary no matter how calm he sounds. But not Cena. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depends on your definition of real. Racing teams change ownership and rights throughout the years that it's hard to really keep track on who carries which legacy. IMO only Ferrari and Williams are still who they are as they were when they started. 

even the current McLaren is actually continuation of Ron Dennis's Project four racing team that merged with the original McLaren racing team but they kept the McLaren heritage. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. There should be an incentive to finishing higher, hence why the point gaps will always goes smaller the lower you finishes. 

2. A close point gap means that a consistent driver  a fast driver. You could end up with a driver that does not win any race in the season finishing top. Something that happened once in Moto GP's 125cc category when the champion never won any race that year.


3. Reason 2 was why the current points scoring system was introduced. The previous point scoring system was criticized for not giving the "winningest" driver the most points.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1 - They wanted to

2 - No TV station wanted the WCW brand. AT ALL

Vince wanted to keep the WCW brand as a seperate entity as his roster was too big. But there were no TV station that wanted to carry it due to the stigma it had. He offered the network that carrying SmackDown at the time to put WCW on SmackDown's slot, but it was quickly shot down. Hence we had that stupid invasion angle and the death of WCW. But we have the roster split down the road, just as Vince wanted </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a good opinion. but there is a reason LU can pull it off. For one, they are taped for a while back, and hence, why they could produce all those awesome looking camera angles and such, because they have time. Try being live, or taped with a time constraint (taping that is needed to be shown in a few weeks, instead of month for example) and I doubt it would still keep the same feel

Also it's too niche. I for one could still suspend my reality while watching TNA/WWE/ROH, but with LU, you have to watch it like watching a TV series/soap opera. There is no nagging feeling like something would blow up and change the industry, like the pipe bomb, or Jeff Jarret's GFW invading TNA. That reality factor IMO is severely lacking at the moment </TEXT>

Note that they are not actually perfect tho. There are some cases that WWE's style is better. For example when Finn was outside slamming into KO on the barricades, They followed Finn from behind, making it looks slower and less impactful. WWE under Dunn would shot it from the front making it look like it was a high impact move </TEXT>

<TEXT> No. Thing is Vince TRIED to keep the WCW brand. WWE planned a WCW PPV a month after WM17, and they even wanted to take off Smackdown and put WCW in it's place, but nobody wanted to touch WCW with a 10 foot pole at the time. It does not matter who bought WCW at the end, it would have died </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree. Behind that "marketing" racing team, most likely lies a real racing team that works hard to win and have a passion for racing. For example Red Bull Racing is nothing more than Horner's own Arden Racing Team. Similar to Marussia, who is just the sponsor, the real team that runs the racing outfit is Manor. Sponsors comes and goes, but these people and team will remain, albeit in another name when the time comes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> All wrestlers have that "opening identity" that makes it easy for people to recognise who the wrestler is from just a few bars.

Most of Jim Johnston's music has this style. They range from a signature sound; Austin's glass shatter, Mick Foley's car crash, Undertaker's gong; or a signature line that is sung; The Rock, BA Billy Gunn, The Big Show; those songs were easy to identify and would always instantly make you recognise who is coming out </TEXT>

Also VR won't give them any advantage. It's slightly more laggier, as well as drivers don't even have much range of head movement in the cockpit in real life means there is no reason for them to use it </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be honest, I only caught the last 5 hours of WEC last weekend and seeing a Porsche so far in front, it was like watching F1

What annoys me tho was the commentary

"**More people are now switching from F1, because of factors such as sound**"

But most of the Diesel LMP1 car was totally SILENT, and usually the ones with the awesome sounds were from the GT class.

"**More and more F1 drivers seem to be coming to WEC**"

But that had been always the case. 

"**WEC provides wheel to wheel actions!**"

From what I understood that only happened up til nighttime, where the Porsche pulled a lead, and most of the overtaking after that happens in the pits

<TEXT> Lots of reason

- Weather. The FIA need to make sure the race avoid the most extreme weather that the hosting country could achieve. This could be the Monsoon in Malaysia or the extreme summer in other places

- Tradition. Some races are traditionally in that date. For example Monaco is always near the end of May, and would usually be at the same weekend as the Indy 500. Canada would always follow it next, and then LeMans. If they can help it, they would usually make it that way. I think Brundle was saying that the FIA would usually assign the Monaco GP's date for the year, and work out the rest of the races from there.

- Host circuit calendar. They also need to see if the host circuit will have a free slot. Can't really plonk the race in a weekend where the host circuit has already agreed to do another race can we? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cena was supposed to face Rock at Wrestlemania. CM Punk challenged Cena, if Cena lost, CM Punk will get that shot instead.

So we have a PPV Tier match between CM Punk and Cena on fucking RAW. It was so good because they busted out moves that they would never do. Punk with a piledriver and Cena with a hurracarana (kinda botched but that's beside the point). 

It was awesome because storytelling wise, they both want to win, and they are digging deep using moves that one would never imagine them to do

<TEXT> Gotta disagree. I live in Asia, which is quite far away from US as you can get, but during AE, most of the males in the schools watches wrestling. Heck, majority of the grown up does as well. And at the time we did not even get RAW on free to air TV (only Superstars that have RAW recaps, RAW was on cable) but that did not stop kids from emulating The Rock, Stone Cold or Undertaker. 

What's more amazing was WCW was virtually non existent, even tho they were as large as WWF at the time. This is due to WWF's reaching out to oversea countries knowing that they would get more money while WCW which was bankrolled by Turner decided that they don't need outside exposure. And even without the Monday Night Wars, WWF still manage to gain mainstream appeal in my country.

The day I knew about the Monday Night War and WCW was when they were showing the episode of the Radicalz debuting on RAW, and a local newspaper that had a wrestling column suddenly talked about that defection </TEXT>

IMO the current live timing on the browser is good because not only it works for desktop browsers, but it also works for phone browsers as well

2 - The Live Commentary tab also has radio messages, some which are not even shown on the telecast

3 - Depending on who shows F1 in your country, they would also carry additional channels. For example, Fox Sports in Asia has a dedicated Onboard, Pit Lane and Track Map for each race that is accessible from their website </TEXT>

Quote #160 

"Chris Jericho's final WCW match was 7/21 in Peoria, IL in a tag match teaming with Eddie against Kidman and Mysterio. Before the match, Jericho said that if he got pinned he'd leave WCW. Misterio than said everyone already knew it was his last night in WCW. (After the match) all four hugged in the ring. There were fans in near tears, as was Jericho. Kidman started a Jericho chant. Jericho said that he was overwhelmed by the response, but he still thinks that Peoria sucks" - The Wrestling Observer Newsletter: August 02, 1999

<TEXT> Hi Alex, 

First off, how different is driving an F1 car compared to a LeMans/endurance car?

Does it effect how you approach race? How do you pace yourself?

And how is it racing in a car shared with someone else? Does some leeway has to be taken when either drivers have a disagreement?

Thank you </TEXT>

<TEXT> Those games that were based on the original Gmotor/gmotor2 engine (rFactor, GTR, GTR2, GT legends, rFactor2, Shift, Shift2, etc) has an easy way to know where to brake when you turn off the racing line. Look for the darker patch of tarmac on the road. That's your braking point.

In any cases the patch is similar to the other color of the road, start braking where the rumble strip starts </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is the logical step for Kunos. The success of Project Cars must have something to do with this decision. I'm actually happy as this means that the PC version will also have more contents. 

IMO though, the console and the PC version will not be quite similar. Modding would certainly be a PC version only. Most likely the console version will be a separate game altogether? 

ISI did this with the F1 Challenge game, where the playstation version differs highly from the PC version </TEXT>

Without both assist, one need to think where to brake without locking up, and when to throttle out without spinning, hence anyone that wants to stay on the black stuffs tends to be more diciplined </TEXT>

<TEXT> - More CDN across countries, like for me in Asia, this is waaay smoother than Twitch
- Silky smooth Google connections
- Everyone has a youtube app on their phone, you don't need to install a third party app to view it
- Monetization. 
- All of your streams are archived, and encoded by Youtube automatically

There are a few kinks (I feel that they could make this easier for game streamers, right now it's targeted for people who are doing things like concert and such) but IMO once you get the hang of it, it's miles better than twitch </TEXT>

The best I could do for now is a 1:20. Lot more time to be found tho. I still yet to soften the suspension  and increase diff lock.

But the hardest thing is in real life, Monaco is lapped with a super soft tyre. PCars only has one tyre compound and it's suited for every circuit so that means it's harder than what  you would use in real life, hence slower </TEXT>

Sami is certainly still working injured. He needs a longer off time and in the meantime, they need another top level face since Hideo is also out for 8 to 6 months. They have already plans for Uhaa to debut slowly, so why not get one of the most hottest property right now to debut and take over Zayn/Hideo's role?

I always use that during online races where new drivers would use the upper non banking section and I would just swoop through and overtake them. There is a LOT of time to be gained there

I'd say the heavier, brushless motor means that you have a better control on your steering (no more gear meshing feeling) and you will get better road feedback as well

Also the stock rim that comes with the set feels awesome and robust </TEXT>

<TITLE> Penalty and Corner Cutting in Project Cars is Pure Bollocks </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-15 05:44:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was racing online at Bathurst last night. I was on pole, and was looking forward to a clean race since the other guys were fast on the straights, but my car was fast on the twisty bits, hence I would be out of harm's way when cars thread the needle on the top of the hill

But it turned into a sham quickly. At the start, the guy in third jumped the start, and hit me. Not only that I have now a broken car, I ALSO have deemed to jumped the start, even tho it was not my fault. 

As I trundled along avoiding the mass accident on top of the hill as I expected to happen, I pitted, sure to be able to challenge for some consolation places. 

But due to the auto pit exit, the bloody game said that I cut the corner when exiting the pits. And I have a bloody 1 MINUTE penalty. 1 minute! How the bloody developers think that 1 minute is a good penalty for corner cutting?

Now that I have lost a lot of time for that penalty, I have to pit for a second time to fix my car, and I thought the first penalty was my own fault, so I slammed on the brakes before the manual control was handed back to me when I exit the pit lane. But lo-behold! I was given ANOTHER BLOODY 1 MINUTE PENALTY.

TL;DR: Corner cutting is buggy, and the penalty should be lessen to 5 seconds </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can't seem to adjust the brake balance in the car. I've been locking the rears on the Formula A and usually I would shift the brake balance forward for corners that i have this issues. but it does not seem to work as my rear keeps on locking. 

Manually shifting teh brake balance in the pits works, but then I would have an overheating problem as I can't shift the brakes to the rear.

Anybody else having this problems? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Had some issues with Logitech Profiler and Project Cars. When the game starts, apparently Logitech Profiler (running in background) would crash, and restart. This will lead to the game being forced back to the foreground. In some rare cases, the game would not show up even if you click on the icon on the taskbar

Solutions:

If you are using logitech peripherals like controller and steering wheel, run the game in Windowed mode. 

Either that or uninstall Logitech Profiler altogether if you're not using any Logitech peripherals </TEXT>

<TEXT> Physics told us it wont happen. To do quick release system for engine would introduce high stressed parts, especially on the drivetrain. That does not include the fact that they need to unplug and replug the fuel line, which introduce danger. 

The only real solution would be to make the whole rear detachable. But that would mean a weaker monocoque they wpuld flex and roll and in the end disintegrate the car. To renforce it would mean added weight. And there is no way they would want a heavy car because that would offset any advantage they would have in the first place </TEXT>

An engine much more complicated. Considering that the modern engine now is ICE, where it interconnects to each other, and more importantly connects to a drivetrain that connects to the rear of the chassis. That would at least take an hour of work. </TEXT>

My settings are
Deadzone: 0%

<TEXT> Yes. That's what I thought as well. Pirelli won't want the Silverstone debacle again, as well as the FIA. Imagine a team using the SS at Sepang, and it hit the cliff in the middle of the lap sending the car careering off. Won't be a good PR </TEXT>

<TEXT> Did you change controller type? When you set it at gamepad/joystick, the game change the input based on how long you press/hold.

Changing it to Wheel makes it use analogue input instead </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah. The map will have track numbers on them so that they can easily identify and which corner when communicating with engineers

Some teams have them on the steering like so:

<TEXT> It was made by ISI. The base game engine (gMotor) IS a full blown simulator and was used to make: -

- rFactor (gMotor2)

-- rFactor team version, which some teams uses for promo purposes on roadshow. McLaren uses this. Also Formula E road show uses this modded version at all of their races.

-- rFactor Pro, of which some F1 teams like Red Bull and Toro Rosso uses for their simulator. 

-- rFactor 2, an updated version of rFactor with DX11 support

- GTR/GTR 2 (gMotor2)

-- Developer of GTR, Simbin/Slightly Mad Studios went on to make NFS Shift and Shift 2 with only some game engine, with graphic updates. 

- Reiza Studio's Stock Car Extreme, Formula Truck and Copa Petrobras. (gMotor2)

<TEXT> I don't agree to an extent. What's the best flowing track on the calendar? Hungaroring. The drivers love it because once you're in the groove, it's like riding a roller coaster driving there. But we all know how hard it is to overtake there. 

While a circuit should be blamed, some of the problem also lies with the cars themselves. The dirty air syndrome was always something the FIA had tried to get rid of, every time they introduce a new rule. But every time they do, engineers find a way to gain more downforce in areas they could, which in turn, introduce back this problem. The rulings for 2009 for example was introduced due to this as well as various ruling there after, but almost always, the teams manage to churn out a car that still has this problem.

Combined that with Pirelli tyres that does not last that much (because oh, people want to see tyres that does not last) you have team that err on the side of caution and instruct the drivers to drive within a certain constraint.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> awesome and good wallpaper material as well. did you render the on track pics? because those those looks damn realistic.

the design is brilliant, even tho most wont adhere to FIA rule and / or make no sense (single pillar for the front wing?) but concept car never meant to make sense.

<TEXT> Meltzer believes that Lesnar was fully informed of the new plan before he signed his new contract last Tuesday.

This I think is the most crucial part of that. It shows that the creative already had it planned, but kept it from both Seth and Reigns. The decision might even be because of Bork himself, as he might have refused a new contract if he was pinned.

Reigns and the whole Anoa'i family might have been told after Royal Rumble that he would win, but they changed heart after all the heat he is getting, which makes sense with all the dirtsheet news we are reading

Or, this is just an elaborate April Fool by Meltzer </TEXT>

<TEXT> The irony is the BBC needs him as much as he needs the BBC. 

The reason that Top Gear works is that Top Gear buys most the cars (with taxpayer's money mind you) they feature on the show (except for special cars like from Ferrari), hence when the presenters gave some bad reviews, car companies can't retaliate. This is what makes Top Gear special, as they can basically say what they want without repercussion, something other car shows, which the cars are sponsored, can't do </TEXT>

- animation is as good as it can be, but the CGI sometime looks overdone. I love how the crowd was animated/CGI'ed. They do not look copy pasted, but looks like a crowd of individuals

- I know the manga was kind of funny. But I never expected they would keep it in the movie. Lucifer/Ral adventure was kinda weird to watch, but man it was funny

- After watching this, now I realised why Char/Casval hated Amuro. He was the original angsty, emo kid in a death machine and Amuro stole that gimmick </TEXT>

Officially it's to stop both team to one up each other in term of the engine power in a race, which could lead both engine to retire prematurely (the ICE need to last 4 races) </TEXT>

<TEXT> It started in the 90s I think, when a driver has to nominate which tyres they would use in the race. The tyre manufacturer will bring two compounds, a prime (which would be the safe tyre) or the option (a softer tyre that would be faster but won't last as long). 

Once you made the decision, you will be stuck with it for the whole of the race. As you can see at this moment in history, there is no reason for tyre mismatch, as you're stuck with one compound of tyres!

The Option + Prime combo usage was decided by Bernie to spice up racing, as seen from it's highly effective use in America's CART series. A lot of people have asked if they can mix and match the tyre compound, as every year you would hear Martin Brundle mention it at least twice. But the FIA had shot down the idea quickly as it would be "confusing to the viewers".

Note that not only you can't mix the tyre compounds, but you also can't switch which tyre side. For example you can't switch a left front tyre to a front right tyre. Juan Pablo Montoya's McLaren had it's front tyre mistakenly switch around, and in the race he complained that the car felt like it had a puncture.  </TEXT>

Most of the ex drivers or the one inside the business are good pundits, or opinion givers, but they are not writers. It's a different thing talking compared to writing an article piece. 

I do still read the magazine tho, because sometimes there might be hidden gems, really good articles that you did not expect to read. But those are rare and few.

<TEXT> Give him any kind of car, and he will drive it. While Alonso can be said to have a similar ability, Hamilton seems to just be able to get in the car, and just drive it, while Alonso might need more time to learn the car. 

I was impressed with Hamilton in 2009. He managed to wring that POS McLaren to places and wins that it was not supposed to have. It might be that during that time he used the car to learn how to drive on the edge, but yet save fuel and save his tyres, two thing that he was really bad at in 2008 and 2007

I still rate Alonso higher as he is the most complete package on the grid today, but I really love Hamilton as the pure racing driver </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think Crofty and Brundle were talking about what can be considered as taking an advantage, and Brundle explained that the stewards would see the sector times and their own racing experience to judge wether or not a driver gains or loses any advantage. 

Since Hamilton lost a lot of time on the first sector, he was deemed to have made a mistake and nothing more was thought of that </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's hard not to get coverage without ads. Bernie charges A LOT for F1 broadcasting, and stations usually cover this cost by selling ad slots. Sky basically could run the coverage without ads because they can cover up the losses through other channels, and even then you have ads during free practice and qualy, and this is in a country where the F1 viewers are usually high

For North America, where the F1 viewer numbers are usually less than Europe, they have no choice. They have to have the ads. But if you find them too obtrusive, I suggest emailing them and suggeting them to make a side by side window for the ads. There are a lot of other sporting events where the ads are shown at the same time with the main sport. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Hopeful Asian Talents for F1 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-03 11:08:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> F1 has long been dominated by European drivers. But once in a while you would see drivers from other continents, like Australia, South America and North America making a name for themselves in the sports. One continent that has the least amount of drivers competing in the sport is Asia. Currently, only Japan's Kamui Kobayashi is representing Asia in the sport. 

Let's take a look at up and coming prospects from Asia that might one day end up with a race seat in one of the F1 teams in the future

.............................................................................................................................



**Ma Qinghua** (China) - 26 y/o

**Sponsors:** *Unknown*

**Current Drive** Citron Total WTCC (*WTCC*)

The great hope of China, Ma was the Chinese chosen driver for the ill fated A1 Grand Prix series. He has a lot of European single seater race experience under his belt, and was the test driver for HRT and Caterham. Now driving for Citroen in the WTCC series. Is the first Chinese driver to win a WTCC round when he won in Russia

**Chances:** *Slim*   


................................................................................................................................



**Takuya Izawa** (Japan) - 31 y/o

**Sponsors:** *Honda?*

**Current Drive** ART Grand Prix Team (*GP2*)

A former Formula Nippon driver for Team Aguri, Izawa made a name for himself in the Japanese touring car race series, Super GT. Made a jump to European single seater this year as a driver for the highly rated ART Grand Prix team. Has had a lackluster season, but he had his first podium finish in Hungary after Colletti was penalised. 

**Chances:** *Slim (Might end up having a test driver role when Honda joins F1)*   


................................................................................................................................



**Rio Haryanto** (Indonesia) - 21 y/o

**Sponsors:** *Pertamina*

**Current Drive** EQ8 Caterham Racing (*GP2*)

Raced in single seater series in Asia and Australia, Rio made a move to European single seater in 2010 competing in GP3. He was mightily impressive, even winning a race in Turkey, and winning two more races in 2011. Was Max Chilton's partner in GP2. Considered a fast driver, but needs more experience under his belt. He is also the first Indonesian driver to qualify for a Superlicense. 

**Chances:** *Moderate (Pertamina might buy him a seat in the future)*   


................................................................................................................................



**Kimiya Sato** (Japan) - 24 y/o

**Sponsors:** *Unknown*

**Current Drive** Campos Racing (*GP2*), Euronova Racing (*AutoGP*)

A young and upcoming driver from the land of the rising sun, Kimiya amazingly started his single seater career in the UK with the Formula BMW racing series before going back to Japan. He was the runner's up in the 2009 All Japan Formula 3 National series, before making the trip back to Europe to join the Formula 3 Euro Series. Runners up in the AutoGP championship last year, and now racing in both GP2 and AutoGP. Currently leading the AutoGP championship, but having a torrid time in GP2. 

**Chances:** *High (Honda might find him the best bet to give a racing seat to a Japanese driver)*   


................................................................................................................................



**Sean Gelael** (Indonesia) - 17 y/o

**Sponsors:** *KFC Indonesia*

**Current Drive** Jagonya Ayam with Carlin (*F3*)

This young driver from Indonesia made a fast rise in his career. Only started professional racing in 2011, racing in the Asian Kartin series where he finished third. Wasting no time he moved to Europe just two years later competing in Formula 3. Currently in his second year of F3. Still has yet to show his rumoured potential.  

**Chances:** *Moderate/Low (Unless he shows results in the next few years, it's doubtful that he could break into F1, especially since Carlin is one of the best racing team in single seater. Considering that his sponsors is not really a traditional name in motorsports, they are most likely not to pay for his F1 seat)*   


................................................................................................................................



**Jazeman Jaafar** (Malaysia) - 21 y/o

**Sponsors:** *Petronas*

**Current Drive** ISR Racing (*Formula Renault 3.5*), HTP Motorsports (*Blancpain GT Series - One off race*)

Malaysia's hope for the future, Jazeman competed in karting in both Malaysia and Europe. Was one of the few drivers given a special leeway when he wanted to join Formula BMW Asia due to his really young age. Won the championship in hist first year, he then moved to Europe, competing with Raikkonen Robertson Racing. He then moved to Carlin to drive for their Formula 3 team. Had a lackluster two years before finishing second in British F3 in 2012. He then moved to Formula Renault 3.5 for again Carlin, before he moved to ISR Racing this year. Has a couple of podium in Monaco and Spa as well as finishing 5th in the Spa 24 hour race this year with HTP Motorsports.

**Chances:** *Moderate/High (A Petronas Motorsports development talent and might be given the test seat for Mercedes due to the close relationship with Petronas Motorsports and Mercedes)*

FAQ

**What is this?**

It's a *free* streaming site that I use to stream sports from my home. I actually use it so that I can watch my own TV when I am at the office, as I usually work 10~12 hours a day 

**What will you be streaming?**

Sports, mostly football and motorsports. Priorities for Formula 1 and Arsenal, in that order.

**What is the quality of your stream?**

Due to location (I am in Asia, and I am streaming it to a Ustream server in the USA) I limit the stream to 720p, 25fps, 1.5Mbps. 

**Why Ustream and not (insert the streaming choice of my liking)**

Because it's easy, and it can be watched by everyone no matter if they are on a PC or on a mobile phone. Also they are a bit lax on DMCA takedown. And if my stream do get taken down, registering another account is really easy. Also it's the fastest non pay RTMP streaming service that I have tested

**What is the channel source?**

Malaysian cable sports channel. So you won't get the same pre/post match thing that you would expect or get from UK channels. Also be prepared for last minute changes and fuck ups. 

**Are you making any monies from this?**

I do put some google ads on the site, but I don't actually care, as the monies from the ads can barely pay the monthly fees for internet and cable tv here. Also doing this to help fellow Gooners and F1 fans

If you guys have any questions or request, go on ahead! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Mid-season. Rate the drivers up till now </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-28 15:10:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Now that the summer break is here, how would you rate the drivers up till now?

Nico Rosberg

Calm, smart, and calculating. Took his chances and took it well. It's not surprising that he is leading the championship. But if there is an achilles heel, it's that he needs all of his engineers input to make his driving faster, and IMO this is what could derail his championship run at the end of the season


Lewis Hamilton

Definately the driver to watch. He is unlucky not to be leading the championship. But honestly the two drivers from the back of the grid to the podium in Germany and Hungary was the drives of the season. For the people who disagree, I would like to remind you that he drove in Germany with brakes that he hates, and in Hungary with a rebuilt car that he have no idea how it feels. He could still pip Nico at the end of the season


Daniel Ricciardo

Revelation of the season. Calm and adapted to life in the Red Bull like duck to water. If it's not for the Mercedes total domination, he could be up there fighting for the championship. Next year he will definately be closer tho. Expect more wins to come this season yet.


Seb Vettel

The loss of the blown diffuser hits him more than any other drivers on the grid. Still not being able to adapt to the new car, nevertheless he has been calm and mature. Other than the "tough luck" moment earlier in the season, he is quite okay with his teammate being faster. Might end up finding his form again after the season resumes


Nando Alonso

Best driver in the grid in not the best car on the grid. Flatters the Ferrari more than it actually should. The second half of the season would see if he stays at Ferrari or find a better team. 


Kimi Raikkonen

Struggling. That is the only way to describe him this season. And his bad back is definately not helping. Add to Ferrari's questionable tactics and strategy he finds himself in places he should not be at in the first place. Might be his last season in F1.


Valterri Bottas

Next great Finnish hope. Finished the half season with a lot of good drives. Took his chances and shows that he is faster than his much older teammate. If Williams can find more speed in the car, then he could find himself a win in the second half of the season, especially if the Mercs trips over each other


Felipe Massa

Guy can't seem to find a break. His bad luck, especially at the start of races seems to be much more worse than Hamilton's. Struggling to keep pace with his teammate


Jenson Button

Missing Hamilton's setup input. Does not help the McLaren is shit. With the departure of Whitmarsh, his place in the team is also under threat as Ron is not really his largest fan. Might be his last season with the team, unless he can turn his season around


Kevin Magnussen

Started the season with a podium but slid back. Shows some flashes of speed. But still does not show anything special, yet.

Only selected races were recorded by me due to various reasons

- No race 1-3, as I had not acquired a capture card when it aird
- No race 10, as my cable provider did not air the Friday's race, and never aired a repeat of it.

All races are in 720p, 50FPS, at around 5mbps bitrate.

<TEXT> It's interesting to see that everytime the fuel graphics comes out, it's Lewis Hamilton (and to some extent, the Williams) that is using the least fuel than anyone else during a race weekend.

This combined with the ability to still post competitive time is really quite amazing considering that people says he is an "all out driver". This could play into his hand later in the year if he needs some more power when push comes to shoves </TEXT>

1 - How do I lessen tyre wear? In career mode at China, I noticed that my tyres were wearing out faster than other cars, even tho I was using throttle modulation to make sure there is not tyre spin out of the corners

2 - Why does the car feels like it's understeering? At Spa I am loosing time entering Bruxelles and Pouhon waitng for the front end to grip, even when the AI can just accelerate out from there.

3 - Any wheel setting guide? There is not much feel when the tyre is losing grip

4 - Is it normal that the AI are different from each track? I was winning around 40s at Melbourne and Sepang, but Hamilton was right at my tail in Shanghai no matter what I do or how much I push </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why More Fuel Still Leads to Fuel Saving By Teams </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-04-07 04:51:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 2014 is an interesting time. New rules, and except for Mercedes, other teams are still struggling to understand how all it works. In this time of chaos, many ideas are thrown around trying to find something to "Spice up" the race again. One of this was "raise the fuel limit so they can go flat out from start to finish"

Now this might seem logical at first glance. This season, cars are limited to only 100Kg of fuel (or ~140litres, depending on density). This means that teams are forced to save fuel and can't push as hard as they like. More fuel = less saving = faster racing right?

But what if I said that idea is not accurate? Remember the fuel limit? It's kind of helpful that the FIA uses "100Kg" as it shows that the fuel is actually quite heavy. C'mon, try dragging 100Kg around and tell me it's not heavy. And if you were in any physics classes during your school days, you know that weight does influence things.

First, let us refresh back on what extra weight can do to a race car. Extra weight means that you will have a higher lap time. Also tyre wear would be higher due to the grip needed to fight the momentum of the cars in during cornering. Another thing is braking point is also extended, due to momentum of a heavier car.

There is also the repercussion of driving flat out all the time. It induces unneeded wear on the parts of the car, and also puts strains on the drivers as well. Tyres wears out faster as well due to overheating.

Now let's imagine a race, where one car is given a 200Kg limit and another is given a 100Kg limit. During practice, the car with the 100Kg limit could lap an average 0.4 per lap faster than the one with the 200Kg limit. Just 0.4 per lap. Not much faster. They entered a 50 lap race. The 200Kg limit car is pushing all out, while the 100Kg car is saving fuel. 

Since the 100Kg car is saving fuel, the lap times is now actually similar. There 200Kg car is pushing and pushing. But wait, by lap 12 the 200Kg car needs to pit since the tyre is now toast. The 100Kg car meanwhile eaked out to lap 18 before pitting. A classic case of a 3 stopper vs 2 stopper. But since the lap times are similar this actually means the 200Kg car already have a 20s disadvantage due to an extra stop it has to make

The race goes on and both cars are now lapping faster. But the 200Kg car still needs to make up that extra stop. Having nothing to loose, it keeps pushing full throttle, now lapping a tad faster than the 100Kg car

Final stint, and now sprint to the finish. The 100Kg car is now pushing more due to saving fuel at the start. But since both have now used much of their fuel, the lap times are dropping to a similar level. The 200Kg car is spewing brake dust everytime it's brakes for a corner though. Due to the heavier car, the brakes were working harder and is now nearly finished. Things does not look good in the engine side either. A decision must be made, and the pit called to the 200Kg car, asking him to slow down to save the car. 

The above example might not be accurate, but it does gives an idea that more fuel does not really mean better racing. During the days of yore, teams usually underfuel or use the minimum fuel that they can to have a lighter car that might have to save fuel at the start but could push at the end. Upping the fuel limit it worthless if the teams themselves does not even care

The only way around this in theory is to introduce back refuelling, which would mean the cars could still fuel low, but does not have the danger of running out of fuel. But this does introduce another problem. Cars that are already fast on fixed fuel like Mercedes, could end up going faster than they are.

In the end there are no easy and simple solution for better racing. It's made even harder now that armchair fans are more vocal with ideas that they have no idea about using social media. Nothing is as simple as it seems, especially in the complicated world of Formula Racing </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me it was an ironic thing of can't affording a console. My family never even had a NES or FAMICON or anything like that. It was after I got into secondary school (or high school in relevant countries) that I first came upon a computer, in the lab, with Starcraft on it. And a friend of mine taught me how to play it. It was not long before we joined a computer club, and spent the evening on 8 player LAN playing starcraft and need for speed. 

A few years after, while the playstation is considered affordable, I still can't afford it. Thankfully cheap Cyber Cafes were popping up, and we were then introduced to the original Half Life. It was not long before we discovered it can also do multiplayer. When Counter Strike came into the picture, consoles are long but forgotten.

So thank you console for being so expensive that I had to play the PC. It introduced me to Multiplayer and better graphics </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-03-19 00:20:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Here's something to chew about. Kevin Magnussen's top speed of 316.9KM/h at the Australian GP was a massive 6KM/h faster than last years's top speed of 310KM/h managed by JE Vergne, and at Australia where the straights are quite short, this is quite an acheivement. It also proves that the straight line speed is still there for the new car, and the only thing that is holding them down is the harder Pirelli tyres and lack of aero grip through the corners.

As the years goes on, engineers and designers should be able to claw back some of this deficit. Although how long do you guys think they can acheive 2013 lap times? For me personally I think it could be as quickly as the Japanese Grand Prix, or as late as middle of next season. But one thing's for sure, the "the cars are 3 seconds a lap slower" would be a thing of the past before long </TEXT>

<TITLE> Two days after hyped by Titanfall, I'm back to BF4 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-03-11 22:30:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was really hyped to play Titanfall, but after two days of playing, I am back to BF4. Reasons?

 Smaller maps and less players. While I have nothing against small maps, the 6 vs 6 kills me off after being used to 32 vs 32

 Less emphasize towards team play. Everybody just plays for themselves. Even on a small scale server BF4 has more tactics

 You can spend 15 minutes just waiting for someone to join in for campaign. You have someone leaving the lobby? Resets everything. 

 Multiplayer server search is also broken and unbalanced. Level 1? Let me lump you with other level 1 players, while the other side consisted of level 20++ players. 

 Also, you can stuck with six players on either Militia or IMC, and you can't send half of them to the other side. Honestly battlelog is miles better than this

 Hit detection is much worse. You can run into things that is not really there, and swear you shoot someone just to see him one shoot kill you back. And this is with low ping and feels much more worse than BF4's "netcode"

Welp, as shit as BF4 is, it's still a better game for me honestly </TEXT>

<TEXT> Might be my location (SE Asia) but trying to play campaign, it's like I have to wait at least 15 minutes before I can even play as the server tries to find players. And when we do find players, we have to wait 90 seconds, and as the clock counts down, someone disconnected, and the counter resets. 

Not only that, for other modes, EVERYONE is on attrition that I waited for 1 hour at the CTF mode without anybody joining. Heck, I was lumped with 4 people in IMC and we were perplexed as why not split two and send them to Militia.

Also network needs better hit detection. I was killed countless times by someone that I shot first but when I look at the killcam, I was not even moving or shooting the other guy. This is with ping lower than 20 at all servers.

<TEXT> For the past two days now, randomly when I use mortar, there was no kill confirm even tho I kill someone with it. The kill does count towards your total kill in the scoreboard, but you won't get the 100 points for killing a person. All the other bonus, like Kill Streak End, Multi Kills, Squad Wipe, etc are shown, hence how I know I was killing with the mortar most of the time.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Job Threads/Core, linked to the crashes? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-02-22 11:25:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ever since BF4 was updated to be able to use Mantle, I've been running the graphic overlay command to tell wether or not I am running D3D11.1 or Mantle. One of the information that the overlay tells are the Job Thread, how many threads that are being used by BF4.

Usually BF4 will use threads half the number of your CPU's core, for example, a quad core CPU will use two threads, while an 8 core CPU will use four. Mantle usually use one extra, so this means 3 and 5 respectively.

What I notice after that fucked up February patch that lead to some maps (Dawnbreaker, Locker, Metro) crashing is that I won't crash on a PC that are using more than two threads. I have three different PCs, an Intel i5 2500K, an AMD A10 7700K Kaveri, and an Intel i7 4700K. Only the i7 does not crash on DX11.1 mode, since it's an "8 core CPU", thus BF4 are running on 4 job threads. 

I will however get crashes on the i5 and the AMD A10 on DX11.1 mode which are running only 2 job threads. Using Mantle which bumps the Job Thread to 3, game runs fine without crashing.

Might be something to look into by DICE </TEXT>

<TITLE> So beta testers, what do you think Respawn should change in the full game? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-02-17 17:25:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> While this beta test is to stress test the servers, we are also in a way testing out all the other features of the game itself. Now what do you guys feel that need to be added/changed in the full game once it comes out? Balances or fixes?

For me

- I prefer the hold to zoom for iron sight and the press once to engage feels too like... COD. I hope there is an option to turn this off (either that or I did not go through the option long enough)

- Matchmaking should be done by player rank. I hate when one side is full of level  10 while the other sides are full of 1s and 2s. I was lucky that my first few rounds were with high level players, but after that I grew frustrated quickly when I was thrown in with lower leveled players. This was worse since Respawn turned off chat in beta so I can't tell them to spawn the titan at the same time.

Other than the too COD like feel of the game, I have nothing much to complain. I do miss a game that is larger and more tactical but I am saving my views on that after the full game comes out </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tested on my rig, and I can confirm that this is a D3D error. Was using SLi GTX680 and keep crashing at Locker, Paracel and Dawnbreaker after the update. Changed to single card and it did not help. Changed to borderless and it did not help

Swapped to an R9 280X, and still crashed. So I changed to Mantle, and restarted the PC and now it works. I am still not amused with DICE tho. What I can surmise is that their Mantle compatibility fix is map specific, and it broke some Direct3D setting </TEXT>

<TITLE> Team balancing needs to be made smarter </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-02-10 06:08:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The built in team balancing options for servers right now is quite basic, and once it detects that one team has a number of more players, it will take the first person that has been killed on the other side and bring it to the unbalanced side. 

This, while is logical sometimes can be infuriating, moreso in RUSH and OB. Three times in Rush, I died after arming an MCOM to see I was moved to the other side. There was an ironic moment when I died arming the last MCOM with the ticket count is less than 10, and I was moved to the other side to see my arm lead the other side to victory, while I was given a lost, even tho I was the one that armed that last MCOM.

For me, this is what I think should be done for team balancing

- No player movement should happen in RUSH once the tickets are are low enough (15 or less)
- Players who died PTFO (capping, arming a bomb or MCOM) should not be moved
- Players that has a high number of captures/MCOM arming or defending or bomb arm should be given "less priority" to be moved

Feel free to add your idea, or fix mine </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Remember when the time that mortar was really overpowered? Dice patched. Now mortar can't be reloaded by support pack, and surprisingly, whomever using mortar can't reload grenades. I kinda understand that logic of losing mortar would loose it for that life. but not having the ability to reload grenades as well is kinda annoying since once your mortar is dead and you are out of grenades, your options are limited to your primary and secondary weapon. There are times that I can't even help my teammate who is in a pinch since I don't have any projectile weapons anymore.

So Dice, please give back the ability to reload nades. I will do anything for you. I will even post good reviews of BF4 on youtube if you want me to </TEXT>

1 - Open regedit

2 - Browse to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE  Software  Wow6432Node  EA Games  Battlefield 4 (64 bit) or HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE  Software  EA Games  Battlefield 4 (32 bit)

3 - Add new key in Battlefield 4 named "Xpack1" 

4 - In Xpack1, add a new string, name: "Installed" value: 1


Go back to Battlelog and voila! you can now join the previously unjoinable servers </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since the Recon class in BF4 has the PLD, as well as the ability to "zero" the optics, I wonder how long does it take til two recons work in tandem, with one using the PLD to gauge how far the target is, and the second one will snipe accordingly. 

This combo in theory would be faster (since only one recon is scouting, so there is not time wasted between switching from the PLD to the rifle and then adjusting the scope) and much more safer (spotter can also watch out for other threats incoming) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Some Question About Activision </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-09-15 03:06:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Newbie gamer here. Basically, why does game titles from Activision rarely have any price drops, if at all. I've seen many games, sometimes even new ones that were being sold, usually during "sales" or "promotion" periods for just the fraction of the original costs. I remember buying Tomb Raider (2013) during a promotion period for just 10 bucks, and yet I rarely seen Activision's game drop near this price range. Was hoping to see an at least 75% discount on the Activision sale this weekend but the most was only 50%, and even then it's only for one title per day. 

Is it because the games by Activision deserve the price that they are selling them at?  </TEXT>
