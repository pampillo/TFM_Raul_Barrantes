<TEXT> I have a daughter.  She's now in her 30s, but when she was younger, she wanted to "model".  I got her an agent and a manager.  She did a few photoshoots, and got a couple local tv spots, soon got tired of it and went on with her life.  She's nurse manager at a hospital in Atlanta, GA now.

Let this be a lesson to all of you.  Always hire professionals, never do anything without a signed contract up front, a deposit and a lawyer's blessing.  Work with a legitimate agent and manager.  Communicate with everyone you know about what your plans are.  Leave your cell phone number, itinerary with your manager and check in ever 30 minutes when on a "shoot".  Never travel alone to a shoot.  Always go with a friend, your agent, a parent, a trusted companion.  Always have a backup "plan b" incase it goes wrong. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think cheating is wrong, but I don't think society should punish cheaters, rather I think it's up to the couple to question the reason why they are together, and be honest about it.

For example, my wife and I lived together for almost 8 years before we were married.  I was working at the military base and a teaching hospital in Seoul, South Korea.  We enjoyed being together.  We had lots of sex, traveled all over the world and rarely ever talked about marriage and children.  Eventually, we decided we were ready to talk about children and then we formed a legal bond in order to protect them (we got married).  We had five children together, one died in a car accident in 1995.  We have three sons and one daughter, and seven grandchildren.  I'm not saying ours was the way to do it, just saying that if you're up front with the person you are with about what you hope to get out of the relationship (sex, partnership, money, security, family, travel partner, etc), then you will last longer.  We've been married 29 years! </TEXT>

The Fed buys all the stuff and rebates all the coupon income back to the US Treasury

It doesn't matter if rates go sky high. The Treasury issues the debt, the Fed buys it coining new money (digital form) receives the interest income and turns around and hands it right back to the Treasury.

A closed and nested circle jerk.

This is not an assumption, guess or proposal, it's how the thing really works.

A self-funding Ponzi. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 63 year old MD here (raises hand).  Dieting doesn't work long term.  If you want to see your daughter all grown up, the #1 best thing for you is walking.  Every day.  60 minutes or more.  Uphill.  Get your heart rate up to 150 or more.  If you want, you can try to keep your calorie intake down to 2,000 a day.

1. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.  Make instant oatmeal cereal (get the bucket of plain oatmeal, cook it in a little pot, covered with water.  you can toss in a handful of nuts (protein) and raisins (sweetener).  Serve it with plain nonfat yogurt and fresh fruit.  Water for beverage.

2.  Lunch: skinless/boneless chicken or turkey is easy to cook - get the breasts or leg pieces, throw a few in a pan with olive oil, garlic or onion and mix up a big bowl of salad greens, fresh tomato, cukes, shaved carrots, whatever you like.  Put the chicken on top and serve with home-made salad dressing.  I take a bowl and mix 1/3 cider vinegar (or red wine vinegar), 2/3 extra virgin olive oil, 1 tsp onion powder, "italian seasonings" to taste, mustard and salt to taste.  Takes 2 minutes to make and tastes delicious.  Beverage: water.

3.  Dinner.  Something light - soba noodles with veggies is a personal favorite, or kimbap or even bibimbap.  Beverage: water or a glass of red wine.  Dessert: fruit.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember when the internet started.  I got my first desktop computer in 1987.  It was an 80/88 with dual 5.25" floppy drives, no hard drive and ran DOS.  My brother in law at the time gave me a 500mb hard drive for my birthday and helped me install it.  It came with a 13" color monitor.  A couple years later, I "upgraded" to a 386 with GEOS gui OS.  Kind of like Windows, but cuter.  It came with AOL, which, at the time, was the only way to get online.  

A lot has changed in the years since.  I think the #1 thing I disliked from the beginning was any spam or advertising.  You could see it from a distance and avoid it pretty easily back then.  When the first adblockers came out (they were individual programs you had to install on your hard drive), I used them all.  Now you can easily install extensions in Firefox and Chrome and there are dozens to choose from...also blocking facebook and google tracking, hiding your IP/Location and much more.  I use them all.  I don't want to be tracked or sold to.  Never did and that is never going to change. </TEXT>

Take this whole Ellen Pao thing.  Someone didn't have the whole story, but made up the parts they didn't know about (that Pao fired Virginia), the whole site blew up and everyone was against her, forcing her to resign.  Turns out it was someone else named Alexis who fired Virginia, and it had nothing to do with Pao.

Keep it up.  You're what's shitty about the world today. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Benjamin Fulford talked a lot about this on his blog 5 or 10 years ago.    Just do a Startpage search for "benjamin fulford new world order putin china brics" and you'll see the articles I'm talking about.

This was planned all along.  

But what does it matter?  Unless you're the CEO of a major corporation, or a the head of a Union or something, there's not much you can do and it won't affect you all that much.

I'm assuming most of you guys are young, probably in your 20s, maybe 30s, correct?  I'll be 65 in 2 years and then I'll retire and be on my merry way.  I guess if you're under 30, you'll be living in an interesting time.  You'll be seeing some strange things happening in the market.

Me on the other hand, I'll be dead. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Millenials (people born after 1985) are living at home with mom and dad.  They are not buying homes and they don't have good jobs.  They have HUGE student loan payments/debt and almost zero cash flow.  That means they are not buying cars or refrigerators or any of the big ticket items.

And the boomers (people born 1945-1963) are dying off.  By 2020, almost 76,000,000 people will be unable to make any sort of large purchases...

That leaves people born between 1964-1985, sometimes called Generation X.  This is the generation that can afford to buy stuff.  And there's only 82,000,000 of you.

The American birth rate is way down.  Millenials can't afford to leave mom and dad's homes, they can't get married and they don't have jobs.  That means they are not having kids.

We're shit out of luck unless we do something drastic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wonder to what extent was Ellen aware that they were using her as a scapegoat?  She seemed genuinely distraught about the result of all of this.  She replied to my first message, but not my second, which means she's probably quit Reddit altogether, and who can blame her?  I doubt she'll be back.  I didn't read all of the vitriol posted about her, but I guarantee you, even an old fart like me would be devastated if even a percentage of that were directed at me!

As to your comment about her being an Asian and Female, I remember early articles where details about her relationship with a married "black" male were cooked up.  This is meant to light a fire in certain circles where Asians and Blacks should never mix.  To a skeptic like me, this kind of negative press early on set the stage for people's dislike for her, that somehow she was not to be trusted.  Of course they presented no evidence in these articles.  And I prefer to give people the benefit of the doubt. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Obviously I believe you're incorrect, otherwise I wouldn't have posted it.  I'm hardly a troll.  I think it's a genuine question that a lot of people think.  For those of you who are not aware, 84% of American citizens are religious, something like 79% of them are Christians.  That's 286 million Christians in the US alone.  I guarantee you, ever single one of them is asking this question.

Now you may think they are nuts, silly, or just plain wrong, and I would agree with you generally.  But how are you going to change their minds?  

It's a topic worth discussing in greater detail and just removing my post because you think it's "trolling" or "disrespectful" just buries a potentially worth-while discussion in my personal and professional opinion!   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well I am an ER doc and most of my staff are nurses.  We use palm top devices for notating and keeping track of most things.  I do have a desk at home, but I rarely use it any more.  When I sit, it's to take a load off on a break.  Even our staff use hand-held devices.  The only people in my hospital that sit for their work are people that interface with the client support system...that is still pretty antiquated.  But it's changing.  For example, an IT firm from Boston just made a presentation last week about how the whole interface (registration, questions, scheduling, billing) system will be automated with touchpads and software within 2 years, eliminating the need for people to sit at desks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Holyoke, MA has more churches per square mile than any other industrial city in this New England state.  When the factories moved to Mexico and later China, the tax base in the city dropped by a huge percentage.  The city had to find a way to recoup its loss, so it forced the churches out (in subtle ways).  Many of them have been converted into public housing and private businesses, replacing some of the tax revenue and eliminating the waste. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But crazy porn nonetheless...According to [VH1](http://www.vh1.com/celebrity/2007-05-09/bwe-exclusive-jared-fogle-the-pornography-guy/), this is nothing new:

"Well, it turns out in college, the All-American Jared was known for something entirely different. According to our source, while studying at Indiana University, Fogle ran a very successful pornography rental company out of his bedroom. His porn collection was vast and extensive, and Fogle took his business pretty seriously. A video would run a patron a dollar a day (cheap!), and people would come from all over to take advantage of the deal. Needless to say, Jared had enough porn to keep his customers happy." </TEXT>

Some problems:

1.  it's slow - any way to speed up the action (witcher runs in slow mo, etc)

2.  mouse is really sensitive, even on the lowest setting it spins witcher around if I'm not careful

3.  key bindings say "none" - do I have to set key bindings on everything or is there a default setting?

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The population is going down across the board, and teens are not looking for jobs (recent NY Times article).  76,000,000 Americans are either retiring soon (including myself), or are already retired (the Baby Boomers).  Where's the incentive to have children now?  America's birth rate is the lowest it's ever been, 12.7 per 1,000 people in 2013.  

We're not having babies and we're dying off.  Millennials and teenagers are not looking for work.

I suspect that many of these old jobs will disappear as people resign from them </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good point.  If they are all god fearing Christians...I wonder about other things Leviticus has outlawed and what they've quit because of them:  

1  Burning any yeast or honey in offerings to God

2  Failing to include salt in offerings to God

3  Eating fat

4  Eating blood

5  Failing to testify against any wrongdoing youve witnessed 

6  Failing to testify against any wrongdoing youve been told about 

7  Touching an unclean animal

8  Carelessly making an oath

9  Deceiving a neighbour about something trusted to them

#1 - we've already outsourced most of our jobs to Mexico, China and India.  Nothing new here

#2 - copyright is already a thing.  you will be fined if you sell something that's copyrighted without permission, you may even go to jail.

#3 - admittedly this may be bad, but inspections in the US have been bad for over 30 years.  In my state alone, there is only 1 inspector for over 1,000 funeral homes and veterinarian hospitals...some of these places haven't been inspected in 10-15 years.  

#4 - as a medical doctor in a busy ER, we are already seeing how much control pharmacy companies have over the hospital.  It can't get worse than it already is (bad)

#5 - from the language of the article, it is not clear whether or not environmental protections are indeed affected by this.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I came to Reddit about 8 years ago from Fark.com  There were only a few hundred people using it at the time.  It was a great community.  I remember when people started comparing it to Digg...that was a huge kerfuffle when that all happened...and a bunch of top Digg submitters created subreddits here and became bigwigs again and the controversy and the naysayers and the whiners... this is just another "thing" and those people who are upset most by it will leave as they did during the last two or three "things" that have blown up on Reddit in recent years.

Meanwhile, I'll stay here, enjoying the site as I did 8 years ago. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's the OP's original text

The original thread where this all started: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/345ssr/rconspiracy_new_queue_moments_ago_notice_anything/cqriaap

The more recent thread where it was discussed: http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3bf43o/the_modtalkleaks_continue_major_moderators_caught/

If you dont want to sift through the above threads, the TL;DR is this: He got caught using alts to upvote and agree with himself as well as creating SRD threads to discredit the sub. Despite the indisputable truth, Flytape bullied the other mods into removing his ban, thus calling into question his own motives for allowing someone who clearly works to discredit a sub that "he cares about" to continue to shit up everything he posts on. Now they are both lying to cover up the trail.

Blacksunalchemy has now deleted those accounts even though there are artifacts of them still around (such as the redditfun link you can find in the thread). At the time of the instance, I sent several mods the info and they all agreed that he was, in fact, clearly engaging in this behavior, but Flytape continues to bully them and protect his "buddy".

He is now back on a new alt, GorgleGoo, and started gaming the sub to try and establish credibility by posting in his own thread here: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3bmwac/cops_livid_over_proposed_police_reform_measures/csnno6v

Fortunately other users noticed this strange behavior and called him out on another thread he derailed here: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3bmqbt/pentagon_changes_laws_of_war_to_declare/

He follows the same MO every time: 1) Disrupt and derail the conversation with garbage. 2) When this is pointed out, claim to be an honest arbiter for the truth. 3) If that fails, then claim that you are an innocent victim of these baseless attacks!

One thing that I noticed and found extremely curious is that, on his new alt, he used an acronym that I only remember seeing one other place: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3bmqbt/pentagon_changes_laws_of_war_to_declare/csoaxzk

I consider myself a CT

This immediately brought to mind another user who constantly disrupts and harasses others on the sub, CT_Warlock. This would follow the naming convention that he likes of dark wizard stuff from MagicTG blacksunalchemy and nomed_yob (boy demon). 100% proof? Nope but just another coincidence that I thought should be pointed out.

Furthermore, lets also not forget that he likes to claim to be a video expert. He draws signs in photoshop for a living as he has freely admitted several times. Nothing wrong with that. This, however, does not make one an expert in video, which he claims to be in order to make the invalid argument from authority in order to debunk others. I, for instance, am a materials scientist, but I dont claim to be an expert in rocketry just because they also call themselves scientists the whole idea of that is absurd. Example of him debunking the faked ISIS videos here: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2thvuu/debunked_the_latest_isis_video_of_two_japanese/

Since we cannot count on the mods to help the situation on this subreddit, and even have to question what motivation Flytape would have for defending a user who was caught red-handed gaming the sub and posting SRD threads to discredit the sub, I think it is only prudent that the userbase be the ones to police themselves.

Great job to those in that thread who caught on quickly to his games and called him out. We need to be the change that we want to see. Keep up the good work, guys.

We Are Change (although they have gotten worse over the last year or so, linking up to InfoLiars too frequently for my taste)

The Intercept

Of the MSM, I read the New York Times headlines, and other related sites, just to get a sense of what's going on.

I skim the new posts off GLP to see if anything grabs my attention (it's mostly junk, but once in a while something interesting appears).

Then just a shitload of other middle-of the road sites that are too peripheral to mention here.  I read between the lines and don't take anything too seriously...I read them to get a general "pulse" of what's happening

Also a lot of unsourced stories that are probably hoaxes and frauds.  Consider anything from Infowars, prisonplanet, alex jones to be an outright fraud; and anything from Veterans Today to be at least 40% lies (according to Veterans Today Editor, Gordon Duff).

Sure people here are less likely to believe whatever latest crap is being trundled out by the main stream media, but there's a lot of alt media crap posted here also. </TEXT>

<TEXT> a colleague's ex wife lived there after the divorce (for about a year).  She said it's infested with druggies, drunks and old people.  avoid it if you can

If you're looking for affordable, yet not too bad, check out:

1.  Belchertown - yeah it's more pricey now than it was 10 years ago, but just a step down from Amherst.

2.  South Hadley - you can find something foreclosed look on Zillow for the latest.  It's a typical new england town full of rednecks and nimby's, but a nice place to live.

3.  Turner's Falls/Montague - yeah there's drugs up there, also poverty, but it's turning around.  Has a nice artist community and is relatively safe.

4.  Shelburne/Buckland - pretty far from everything, but if you don't care about that it's a great place to live

5.  Leeds/Williamsburg/Goshen - see what you can find for housing.  Sometimes you luck out.  Pricier than Belchertown, but close to Northampton.

Places to stay away from:

1.  Ware/Three Rivers/Palmer/Ludlow 

2.  Springfield/West Springfield

3.  Agawam/Westfield

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I play a mandola.  The stretch is not much more than a mandolin.  I can stretch to the 7th fret without too much trouble.

I own two mandolas.  One is a Hora, made in Romania.  Not very nice, about the same price as the truly mediocre Trinity College.  The other is a Big Muddy/Mid Missouri which is a little better, but not much better.  Look around on Craigslist, sometimes you can find a Gibson mandola for around $1800 or so.  I've seen them as low as $900 with some slight damage.

Another idea for you is mandocello.  Of course it's significantly different than a mandolin in every possible way, but closer to a bass. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was one of the first few hundred users of reddit...came here from Fark actually, I can't remember when it was, probably 8 or 9 years ago.  Anyway, I've had 5 accounts banned so far.  I'm actually surprised this one hasn't been banned yet.  It certainly is on some kind of a list, however, because I can't post to certain subreddits, and have to wait 9 minutes to post or comment in others.

So what you do is set up multiple accounts based on what your interests are.  Install a VPN like Tunnelbear and use different browsers, clear your cookies each time.

Or leave.

<TEXT> We all were issued a release from the CDC when the outbreak was first announced.  I don't have a pdf of it as it was printed and handed out as part of a packet of UP documents at the hospital.

Also, in answer to your other question: I'm not in Korea, so no.  But it is on the news here in western Mass, which if you think about it, is pretty incredible.  I mean, we're a tiny fraction of the state...yet we get coverage about the MERS situation in Korea.

<TEXT> I'm an ER doctor in western Massachusetts (USA).  This outbreak was caused by someone with an attitude like yours.  This man, an elderly doctor, didn't follow universal protocols when he returned from a trip overseas, ignored his own symptoms when they began to present themselves, and was part of a system that preferred to ignore/hide a potential threat rather than treat it seriously.

Is it warranted to say that the Korean culture is largely responsible for this outbreak?  Probably not, but it certainly is a contributing factor. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The only people infected so far were patients or visitors of the major hospitals where the vector went originally.  The problem is, it has a 10-15 day incubation period, which means most of those people could very well have already infected someone else.  I think they've quarantined most of the exposed people, but some have slipped through the cracks of course.

I suspect if you stay out of the hospitals, was your hands and don't touch anybody else you don't know, you'll be fine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because we have this thing called "affirmative action" where if you are of an ethnic minority, you get preferential placement in most publicly held positions (police, fire, education, hospital, government, etc).  I don't mean to sound racist here, but that is why most of the people you see working in government offices are black women, two categories given priority over every other one.

<TEXT> Everyone here is going to talk about the seasons/weather, so I will just say get ready for traffic.  You said Lowell, which is a former mill town north west of Boston.  There's a University there and a couple community colleges holding the city together IMHO.  Not much of a nightlife unless you call banging down bud lights with your bros until 2 in the morning a nightlife.  Sure there are concerts and whatnot like any city.  I guess you just have to move here and check out the scene.  But be prepared for poverty, drug use (especially heroin), a lot of crime. </TEXT>

He always wanted a guitar, but both his mom and his Aunt forbade him from becoming a musician because of his loser dad (a professional cruise ship musician).   </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's slow, but it works.  Every time.  

You've probably heard about one of our great musical historians, Chief O'Neil of Chicago.  Right?  He was an incredible dude.  Seriously.  He couldn't read music, but he remembered melodies by "rehearsing" them over and over in his head like you or I "rehearse" addresses or telephone numbers.  He would follow people around on street cars in the city, listen to the tunes they were singing or humming and go back to his office where a colleague who could write music wrote them down.

<TEXT> PAO comes from the chinese name Bao

Last name origins   meanings:

Chinese: there are three different surnames that are Romanized in pinyin as Bao. Other Romanizations include Bau, Pao, and Pau.
Chinese:  this character also means abalone, but the name comes from an old place name. The area of Bao was granted to a chief counselor of the state of Qi during the Spring and Autumn period (722481 bc). His son took the place name as his surname and was called Bao Shuya. Bao Shuya was famous for his lofty moral character and was skilled at delegating authority, eventually becoming the first Chief King of the Spring and Autumn period.

Chinese:  this Chinese character means to wrap or package. The name is derived from the name of Shen Baoxu. Shen Baoxu was a senior official who lived 2500 years ago in the state of Chu. When the state of Chu was attacked by the state of Wu, Shen Baoxu went to the State of Qin to beg for aid. There, he reportedly cried for seven days and nights until the duke of Qin was moved to help rescue the state of Chu.

Chinese:  this character means (violently) sudden. It comes from the name of Bao Xingong, a duke during the Yin dynasty (14011122 bc). </TEXT>

Once we are gone (18,000 of us a year until 2020), these old paradigms will be relegated to traditional religious customs.  But Generation Z is largely non-religious (40% according to a recent Pew study), further rendering this influence negligible.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I believe it was inevitable that this happened.

First we needed online 24/7 with all the social anonymity it offers (nobody can see you're a girl or a boy when you comment or share)

Then we needed a couple generations to grow up with that permanent access

Young women of this generation (post 1995) have learned that what they say and do online is as good or as valid as anybody else.  It's probably the first generation that is completely empowered to be whatever they want to be without the judgement usually associated with sex/gender.

I think it's a good thing and I'm eager to watch and learn </TEXT>

If your instrument is not sounding well, consider a set up from a real luthier.  A new (solid) bridge, a neck adjustment, different strings, fret work, a new tailpiece...all of these will have more of a demonstrable result than a piece of metal that clips onto your instrument.

FWIW a good set up is a requirement whether you play a cheap chinese instrument or a handmade luthier built one </TEXT>

Sam Harris talked about this for a time in a Joe Rogan conversation.  See if I can find the link.

<TEXT> Heroin is made from poppies which grow in Afghanistan.  Here's a website that describes how it is made: http://opiophilia.blogspot.com/2012/12/how-heroin-is-made.html

You can't have heroin without poppies.  Sure you make make similar drugs in the laboratory, but they are very expensive and require government subsidies to support production and distribution.

Would it make sense to go to the places where poppies are grown and destroy the farms that grow them?  That or regulate their production and sale? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whale watching or go to the beach and walk the length of it (can take several hours - bring a knapsack for things you collect and some water).

Mass Audubon also has a reservation in Wellfleet that's pretty awesome...nice trails for hiking, a boardwalk, also a beach area.

Not a lot of "shopping" to do per se, unless you're into cheap knicknacks you can buy just about anywhere </TEXT>

<TEXT> It used to be fun to quest and do dungeon runs.  Now it's super easy to quest, the loot is mediocre and the more advanced levels only have a few dungeons.

Also, part of the fun was getting to the dungeon.  Now you can just port in, do the dungeon, and get out.  Random dungeons don't have any teamwork any more.  In fact, the tank is usually ignored by dps and often not healed any more. 

Well, I guess it's a new game.  2006 was what, 9 years ago?  There's a new generation of players now and they're not the same...don't have the same gaming ethic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> WOW has gotten cringeworthy - the lowby levels (below 70) are easy-peasey, so children are playing them.  And, yeah, they act like children.  The upper levels (70+ are yawn-inspiring.  5 dungeons per area, the quests are annoying and the loot is insipid).  Honestly don't know why I bother playing that game any more.

Guild Wars 2 is slightly better, but you can't explore the unlocked regions, there are no boats to explore the seas, and there are no mounts, so if you're into exploring, as I am, you're SOOL

<TEXT> I never really got into the comments or discussion except here on /r/conspiracy and /r/korea my two favorite subreddits.  The reason for that is it's so anonymous.  Nobody knows if you're a shill or a real person.  Now there are tools to check your reddit stream and get a sense of whether you are real or not.  I use that service before commenting.

Mostly I share posts that are interesting to me, my comments lately have been mostly negative.

And I don't give a shit about karma.  Downvote me all you want...karma is useless IRL </TEXT>

<TEXT> My wife and I own a house and some land in Amherst, MA.  We've lived here since the 1960s.  We love it.  It's racially diverse (I'm white an my wife is Korean), a great place to have a family and grow up (my kids stayed in Amherst and they have their own kids now).

I'm 63, I'll retire in a couple years.  My wife and I have talked about moving to someplace warmer because it's so frikking cold here in the winter.  This last winter was especially bad.  But all of our family are here and it would be a burden to them for us to move away, so I think we'll stay.  Besides, we have a huge house and lots of land.  My wife is an avid organic gardener and we have fruit trees, berry bushes and several gardens.  I'd hate to give that up.

I can't speak about small business ownership.  I work at a couple of the local hospitals which have their issues in management, but overall are excellent.

Like I said, I've owned property in Amherst since it was cheap.  It's very expensive now, but you can find more affordable real estate in Belchertown, which is not too far from here, or South Hadley which is a bit farther, but also a very nice place to live (my youngest daughter lives there with her girlfriend - yes it's gay friendly).

Hope it helps </TEXT>

I like a lot of what [James Corbett](http://reddit.com/r/CorbettReport) has to say, but of course he's not "news".  I read my local papers online "breaking news" pages, and have the [Breaking News](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.breakingnews) app on my android.

For lels, I like [GLP](http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/pg1) and [/pol/](https://boards.4chan.org/pol/)

AMHERST  The University of Massachusetts Amherst is in discussions with the Dalai Lama to have him speak at the university this fall.

Nancy Buffone, the universitys executive director of external relations and university events, said the university was in planning mode.

Were expecting a visit in the fall, thats all I can say right now, Buffone said Thursday. Were in very intense planning.

The details of his appearance at UMass are still being worked out.

The Dalai Lama, Tibetans exiled spiritual leader, last came to the region on May 9, 2007, to speak at Smith College and receive an honorary doctorate from that institution.

He was welcomed that day by both Hampshire and Smith colleges. The Five Colleges run an exchange program with the Tibetan universities in exile in India. The Dalai Lama also spoke privately with members of the Tibetan Association of Western Massachusetts.

With a good education, facilities and warm-heartedness, a person becomes fuller and, I think, better equipped to face problems, he said to a group of thousands at Smith. Education gives us guidance, and warm-heartedness gives us the proper use of all our knowledge.

Constance Kassor, a lecturer in the religion department at Smith and the current director of the Five College Tibetan Studies in India exchange program, said she is pleased the Dalai Lama will likely return to the Valley.

Its a really exciting opportunity, especially for our students, Kassor said Thursday.

Some students who have participated in the exchange program have gotten to meet the Dalai Lama and have a private audience with him, Kassor said.

Anna Lee White, a senior at Mount Holyoke College, participated in the program in January 2013. During her stay in northern India, the Dalai Lama visited the university for a week to give public teachings, she said.

It was incredible to attend these teachings along with thousands of Tibetans, White wrote in an email to the Gazette.

During her groups private meeting with the Dalai Lama, White remembers how many groups were waiting to see him, but how calm, friendly and curious he was with everyone he spoke with.

The group before them were all blind Indian children, and he gave each of them a hug before saying goodbye, White wrote.

I remember him telling all of us that he hopes that someday we would have the chance to travel to Tibet and continue learning about Buddhism and see what it is like there ourselves, she wrote.

The experience led her to return to India the following year for a semester and she will be studying Hindi in India next year after graduating in May.

She will miss the Dalai Lamas visit, but hopes to hear about it from her sister, who attends Amherst College, she said.

Elena Read, a senior at Smith, also participated in the exchange program in 2013.

She said the Dalai Lamas teaching sessions stuck with her more than the private visit with him.

Much of the teaching focused on death, and living with the awareness that one day each person will die, she said.

The only certainty in life is that it comes to an end, Read said. And so to kind of not waste time, I think that stuck with me pretty strongly.

Tibetans believe that the Dalai Lama is the reincarnated being of the Buddhist patron saint of Tibet, known as the Bodhisattva of Compassion, according to the Dalai Lamas website. Bodhisattvas are beings who have chosen to become reincarnated rather than achieve nirvana so that they can serve humanity, according to the website.

Born on July 6, 1935, in northeastern Tibet, the Dalai Lama began education as a Buddhist monk at age 6.

In 1950, the Dalai Lama was called upon to lead Tibet in the face of a Chinese invasion. He went to Beijing for peace talks with Mao Zedong and other Chinese leaders 1954, but was forced into exile in 1959 and has lived in Dharamsala in northern India ever since.

The Dalai Lama has spoken to the United Nations and governments of the United States and Europe, seeking for Tibet the status of an independent nation and a place of peace. He has advocated for non-violence.

He has traveled to nearly 70 countries on six continents and received more than 150 awards including, in 1989, the Nobel Peace Prize. He has also written or co-written more than 100 books.

While the Dalai Lama continues to be the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people, he is no longer the political leader, having transferred that authority to a democratically elected leader in 2011.

<TEXT> For about 15 years, my wife and I donated $500 to the western Mass food bank, so whenever I would see homeless people on the street, I'd convince myself that I'd already done my part.  While I still think donating to the food bank is a good thing, I've changed my thoughts on what to do when I encounter someone on the street.  I now give them whatever cash and loose change I have in my pockets.  Sometimes it's only a couple bucks, sometimes it's a few hundred.  I'm always going to be better off than them, so why not share what I have?  Honestly I don't care where the money goes, and I'm done with judging people on the choices they've made in their lives. </TEXT>

If you're a hiker you'll want to check out the Metacomet Monadnock trail which is nearby, also the Robert Frost Trails.

Speaking of Frost, there's a museum for him at Amherst College

And if you're really into writers, how about the Emily Dickinson museum on Main St? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the bulb show is still going on at Smith College greenhouse.  Worth checking out.

Thornes Market is fun.  We take our grandkids there.

Just walk up one side of Main St and down the other.  There're lots of cool shops to check out.  

Head over to Downtown Sounds on Pleasant St and check out the instruments for sale there.

If you're into music, Turn It Up has used CD, also on Pleasant St.  

A2Z is a hobby/toy store on King St if you have kids that's a fun place to visit. 

A couple nice galleries in Noho.

Amherst doesn't have much to see for tourists.  There are a couple book stores, but the selection isn't great.  I guess the thing I like about Amherst most is the Fretted Instrument Workshop, a great music store with guitars and mandolins and banjos.

<TEXT> OP do you know how government agencies get money for their budgets?  By spending every penny they have!  I worked for the city of Boston in the 1970s.  You could tell a government worker because they would push all of the paper, delay as long as it was legally possible and "hide" whenever they could.  Government workers take the maximum # of breaks that exist, take all of their vacation, and sick time, and know every loophole that exists to keep from helping you or doing their job!

So I'm not surprised to read your story, and I'm positive there's no conspiracy here </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think there's a conspiracy here...Sure it makes sense to put your rant in /r/conspiracy because there are fewer rules here than the rest of Reddit and the mods are generally great guys.  There's a shitload more "democracy" in this subreddit than the rest of the site!

But what I'm saying is, this is just one of the swings of the site...it's going way to the right now and will probably go this way for a couple more years before it swings back the other way.  I should know, I was here when it first started...I learned about it from a FARK link for chrissakes, back when Mike Arrington had just started Techcrunch as a blog...do you guys remember when there was a forum on that site?  With conversations about startups and great new social media sites.  Those were the days!

Reddit used to be this tiny FARK imitation site where you could vote, share and discuss any fucking thing you wanted without moderation, kinda like 4chan, but with a better setup.

I guess some of us are waiting for the next thing, but for right now, we got /r/conspiracy and that's good enough for most of us :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Slaves That Time Forgot

John Martin
Global Research
May 29, 2012

They came as slaves; vast human cargo transported on tall British ships bound for the Americas. They were shipped by the hundreds of thousands and included men, women, and even the youngest of children.

Whenever they rebelled or even disobeyed an order, they were punished in the harshest ways. Slave owners would hang their human property by their hands and set their hands or feet on fire as one form of punishment. They were burned alive and had their heads placed on pikes in the marketplace as a warning to other captives.

We dont really need to go through all of the gory details, do we? After all, we know all too well the atrocities of the African slave trade. But, are we talking about African slavery? King James II and Charles I led a continued effort to enslave the Irish. Britains famed Oliver Cromwell furthered this practice of dehumanizing ones next door neighbor.

The Irish slave trade began when James II sold 30,000 Irish prisoners as slaves to the New World. His Proclamation of 1625 required Irish political prisoners be sent overseas and sold to English settlers in the West Indies. By the mid 1600s, the Irish were the main slaves sold to Antigua and Montserrat. At that time, 70% of the total population of Montserrat were Irish slaves.

Ireland quickly became the biggest source of human livestock for English merchants. The majority of the early slaves to the New World were actually white.

From 1641 to 1652, over 500,000 Irish were killed by the English and another 300,000 were sold as slaves. Irelands population fell from about 1,500,000 to 600,000 in one single decade. Families were ripped apart as the British did not allow Irish dads to take their wives and children with them across the Atlantic. This led to a helpless population of homeless women and children. Britains solution was to auction them off as well.

During the 1650s, over 100,000 Irish children between the ages of 10 and 14 were taken from their parents and sold as slaves in the West Indies, Virginia and New England. In this decade, 52,000 Irish (mostly women and children) were sold to Barbados and Virginia. Another 30,000 Irish men and women were also transported and sold to the highest bidder. In 1656, Cromwell ordered that 2000 Irish children be taken to Jamaica and sold as slaves to English settlers.

Many people today will avoid calling the Irish slaves what they truly were: Slaves. Theyll come up with terms like Indentured Servants to describe what occurred to the Irish. However, in most cases from the 17th and 18th centuries, Irish slaves were nothing more than human cattle.

As an example, the African slave trade was just beginning during this same period. It is well recorded that African slaves, not tainted with the stain of the hated Catholic theology and more expensive to purchase, were often treated far better than their Irish counterparts.

African slaves were very expensive during the late 1600s (50 Sterling). Irish slaves came cheap (no more than 5 Sterling). If a planter whipped or branded or beat an Irish slave to death, it was never a crime. A death was a monetary setback, but far cheaper than killing a more expensive African. The English masters quickly began breeding the Irish women for both their own personal pleasure and for greater profit. Children of slaves were themselves slaves, which increased the size of the masters free workforce. Even if an Irish woman somehow obtained her freedom, her kids would remain slaves of her master. Thus, Irish moms, even with this new found emancipation, would seldom abandon their kids and would remain in servitude.

In time, the English thought of a better way to use these women (in many cases, girls as young as 12) to increase their market share: The settlers began to breed Irish women and girls with African men to produce slaves with a distinct complexion. These new mulatto slaves brought a higher price than Irish livestock and, likewise, enabled the settlers to save money rather than purchase new African slaves. This practice of interbreeding Irish females with African men went on for several decades and was so widespread that, in 1681, legislation was passed forbidding the practice of mating Irish slave women to African slave men for the purpose of producing slaves for sale. In short, it was stopped only because it interfered with the profits of a large slave transport company.

England continued to ship tens of thousands of Irish slaves for more than a century. Records state that, after the 1798 Irish Rebellion, thousands of Irish slaves were sold to both America and Australia. There were horrible abuses of both African and Irish captives. One British ship even dumped 1,302 slaves into the Atlantic Ocean so that the crew would have plenty of food to eat.

There is little question that the Irish experienced the horrors of slavery as much (if not more in the 17th Century) as the Africans did. There is, also, very little question that those brown, tanned faces you witness in your travels to the West Indies are very likely a combination of African and Irish ancestry. In 1839, Britain finally decided on its own to end its participation in Satans highway to hell and stopped transporting slaves. While their decision did not stop pirates from doing what they desired, the new law slowly concluded THIS chapter of nightmarish Irish misery.

But, if anyone, black or white, believes that slavery was only an African experience, then theyve got it completely wrong.

Irish slavery is a subject worth remembering, not erasing from our memories.

But, where are our public (and PRIVATE) schools???? Where are the history books? Why is it so seldom discussed?

Do the memories of hundreds of thousands of Irish victims merit more than a mention from an unknown writer?

Or is their story to be one that their English pirates intended: To (unlike the African book) have the Irish story utterly and completely disappear as if it never happened.

None of the Irish victims ever made it back to their homeland to describe their ordeal. These are the lost slaves; the ones that time and biased history books conveniently forgot.

The man facing down Putin's aggression as secretary of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council is Andriy Parubiy. He oversees national security for the nation having previously served as security commandant during the anti-government protests in Kiev.

Parubiy was the founder of the Social National Party of Ukraine, a fascist party styled on Hitler's Nazis, with membership restricted to ethnic Ukrainians.

Its kind of strange, because in the last five days of the bombing and shelling, we havent seen a single militia compound that has actually been hit. Every building that weve seen been hit by the Ukrainian mortars have been civilian buildings. We personally seen at least over 40 different civilian buildings bombed, that includes a school, an orphanage  we were in an orphanage the day before yesterday that was hit  and the very many large apartment buildings, like the very big apartment buildings have been hit . Some of the apartment buildings  its not like the Ukrainian army miss-aimed or something like this  the same buildings when they are bombed, they hit them very hard. We spoke to one woman who said that in the night a few days ago her apartment building was hit with ten different mortars.

<TITLE> Q: What are you waiting for? A: The Collapse </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-04 14:55:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There will be no collapse.  AT least not in the way you imagine it.  It's not going to be like "Dawn of the Dead" where suddenly chaos erupts everywhere, and the preppers grab their bugout bags and go in the woods.  The ongoing zeitgeist that one day lightning will strike and the proles will rise up is another method of control.  It's far more insidious than that.  Read "The Hollow Men" by TS Eliot and you'll understand.

You'll just notice that every day things will become a little more expensive.  Prices will go up and down, but this constant will always remain: you will need to work longer for less and less.  Young people finishing college will be told at their graduation that "The only way to the top is to start at the bottom," only to see the bottom get lower and lower every year.  Job security will cease to exist as a concept.  YOu'll notice the size of houses and apartments will begin to shrink whilst the price of housing rises.  More and more it will become challenging to find food that doesn't taste rather bland.  You'll see your friends and family less, and one day find that doesn't bother you much.  Marriage will become rare, as will children.  People will begin to indulge themselves in digital fantasies, never actually experiencing the real world.  The modern human will have no religion.  No dreams.  No desires or wants beyond the immediate sating of his bodily desires.  No beliefs beyond the arithmetic (and even that will become a grey area).  One day, still many generations from now, your descendant will walk into a voting booth, and there will be a single choice for him to checK: "Yes."  And every day he will be told from the moment he wakes up to the moment he sleeps, "You are stupid, you are ugly, you are weak.  But together we are free, prosperous, and strong."

That is the true nature of the collapse: the reduction of the modern American man to a feudal serf, incapable of feeling love or hate, and unable to recognize his own self-worth.

<TEXT> Has this been in planning since Obama was elected?  Just recently there has been a huge political push to overthrow the United States government by its own members, and high ranking members of other nations. Obama has "failed" the military industrial complex by recalling troops from the Middle East and by not sending in troops during the "Syria chemical weapons" debacle, and Obama has "failed" Israel by not being more firm with Iran. Saudi Arabia is at risk of being exposed as a direct financial supporter of the 9/11 attacks, and Rand Paul had a speech about how Saudi Arabia is no longer an ally of the United States.

Netanyahu has been working directly with members of the US congress in an effort to overthrow Obama. 
http://nypost.com/2015/02/18/bibi-why-im-speaking-to-congress/

"Why am I going to Washington? Because, as prime minister of Israel, its my obligation to do everything in my power to prevent the conclusion of a bad deal that could threaten the survival of the State of Israel. "

This means that Netanyahu doesn't believe Obama is working in the best interest of Israel, so he's working directly with members of congress to ensure that something happens to change that fact.

Rudy Giuliani, who was in on the 9/11 attacks, has directly attacked Obama
http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/19/politics/rudy-giuliani-obama-america-love/

Rudy Giuliani: Obama doesn't love America

Giuliani, a lapdog, has been making a big scene about Obama. Conservatives love Giuliani and believe everything he says. 

Giuliani states that Obama was influenced by Communists
http://nypost.com/2015/02/21/giuliani-obama-influenced-by-communists-since-youth/

Rudy Giuliani doubled down on his claims that President Obama doesnt love America in an interview with The Post Friday  claiming the commander-in-chief has been influenced by communists since his youth.

DHS intelligence report warns of domestic right-wing terror threat 
http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/19/politics/terror-threat-homeland-security/

They're carrying out sporadic terror attacks on police, have threatened attacks on government buildings and reject government authority.

The DHS was given unlimited power after the events of 9/11. Saudi Arabia has been linked with al-Qaida and the American public wants the "missing" 28 pages of the 9/11 commission reports to be declassified. Netanyahu has stated that 9/11 was very beneficial to Israel. These entities are trying to overthrow Obama and take control of America. Expect a false flag attack in the coming weeks, if not sooner. Afterwards the DHS will launch their plan to incarcerate any that oppose the coup.
