<TEXT> Nofap won't magically make you into a better (wo)man. You won't magically start to see girls queue up around you. Your muscles won't magically grow but nofap does give you the drive to make these things happen. It takes time and persistence but in the end you will be more confident (and clear headed) but only if you force yourself into certain situations.

You won't get a girl by sitting on reddit all day. Just go out into the world and meet people (I know, I know easier said than done but it's possible). And I know  it sounds cheesy but just be yourself. Girls must be sick to death of sex obsessed men who just want to get into their pants. Talk to them like you would anyone else and you might find that you really like her. Don't get down if you get rejected a few times.

You won't find going to the gym any easier (if you're new there) and it won't make lifting any lighter but it might give you an extra drive (and a way to get all of your energy out without fapping) and it will make you feel better afterwards. 

So go outside (even if it's just for a walk, make yourself walk for one or two hours everyday) and you might be all the better for it. Learn to cook there are quite literally millions of videos on youtube! Start drawing, if all you can do is stick figures, who cares keep going (every master was once a begginer). Learn a language, play and instrument, volunteer! There's so much ***you*** could be doing right now, so go and start. 

Nofap is about persistence and patience and hard work and it won't pay off unless you make it. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm not going to write a review of any kind, I'm just going to talk a bit about this book.

I'm really into history, I've read and studied for hours on end about all sorts of things. I spent a long time studying the time periods between 1850-present (although I love ancient history and, well any history really). I heard for years that I should read: "All Quiet on the Western Front" but I always put it off because I was reading sonething else. I finally got round to it. 

When people talk sbout Germany the topic always seem to turn to Hitler and often people are severely under-educated on the subject matter. I really feel sympathetic for the German people of today. They don't feel pride for their country because of what happened.  


Anyway, the book focuses on a group of German soldiers during the first world war and it really captures the essence of innocence lost. Even though the book is a work of fiction it tugs at the hearts strings because to many people went through these situations. It shows that the German troops were just as annoyed about the war as the allied countries. 

It also captures the feeling of camaraderie that was the high point of life in the trenches, like I said this is not a review but I do feel like anyone interested  in war, history or simply looking for their next read should pick up this book.

<TEXT> So I walked in on my brother, let's say, jerkin the gerkin'. I immeadiately closed the door but he was obviously embarassed which reminded me one (of the many reasons) that I'm abstaining from fapping. 

The embarassment on his face showed me how shamed he was. People talk about it like it's normal and healthy and that "everyone does it" but if these were true then why do people get so embarassed when the subject matter comes up?

I'm writing this cause I've seen a ton of posts recently about people who are edging. So if you consider it try and get it off of your mind and if you start think about the pain you'll feel if you continue. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 'How you holding up?' Asked my mum as we arrived home from my best friends funeral, she died in a car crash just over a week ago

I look at her and she can tell I'm hurting:

'I'm, ok. I'm just gonna go up to bed'.

She leaves me as I retreat to my place of solace. I lie in bed and think about all the stuff we did together, we were friends practically since birth. Her name was Liara and she was only sixteen! 

I fall asleep and dream about my recently deceased pal.

Bleep.

I hear the familiar sound alerting me that I've just recieved a text message. I take my phone and stare in horror, the screen reads:

"1 unread message from Liara"

A million and one thoughts rush through my mind and I finally decide to open it, it simply reads:

'Hey'

I immediately respond:

'Who is this?'

Bleep

'It's me, Liara, wanna do something later'

I reply straight away

'I don't know who's doing this but it's not funny, have some god damn respect for the dead' send.

A tear fills my eye.

Bleep.

'What do you mean respect for the dead? Are you feeling ok?'

The text message makes me want to punch something, someone is using my best friend, my dead best friend's phone to taunt me!

'I don't care who you are, just stop. It's not funny!'

The phone rings after I send the last text. Caller ID says it's liara. I answer it and practically scream the words:

'Fucking stoo it, Liara was buried less than two hours ago, don't you have any fucking respect!!'

'What are you talking about, I'm right here' replies the person on the end of the phone... Liara.

'Wh-what?! How. We, we burie-' I reply in shock

'I don't know why you're acting so weird, I'm fine, it must've been a nightmare'

I convince myself she's right but I'm still shaking from the shock. Then she says something, something Liara would never say...







I would continue but I have to go, nice writing prompt though. </TEXT>

"I love you pewds you're so funny!!! :D :D D"

<TITLE> A creepy old man in a cold room in a nightmare in an old house [UPDATE] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-19 21:53:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So here is what I wrote in the original post

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

When I was a kid my family and I moved to the countryside. For the first four years we lived in a small town which was fine but we eventually moved, quite litterally to the middle of nowhere. It was this one street town with like 4 houses. It was ok because I spent most of my time indoors anyway (I've always been indoors-ey). The house we were living in was big, much bigger than anything I had ever stayed in before (before we moved to the countryside we lived in a suburban area of a city with a pretty big home, then a small town, then the middle of nowhere). Most of the bedrooms were upstairs but there was one down stairs. Everytime you went in it it was cold, when I say cold I mean it felt like ice, you could always see your breath. So, as a rule, I stayed out of there. The rest of the house was awesome and my brothers and sisters and I had a pretty cool time living there but I started getting horrible feelings whenever I went near the cold room: My eyes would water like I was going to cry, I would get a sore chest. I always tried to keep myself calm by explaining to myself that it was just me, I got a sore chest because of my asthma, I had watery eyes because of some other reason I'm sure I found less than convincing. The part that gets creepy was when our kitchen was being remodeled. Because of the layout of the kitchen we had to move the fridge into the cold bedroom untill the remodelling was finished. I couldn't stand going in there and eventually I straight out refused. You see I spend a lot of time with my two dogs (who were younger at the time) since I'm almost always inside and whenever they went near that room they would show their teeth and raise their hackles, which they virtually never do. One night I fell asleep and had this nightmare. In it I went into the room to get something as fast as I possibly could but then the door slammed shut and I couldn't open it for the life of me. On the other side my brother was trying to force it open. Then this man appeared he was clothed in a huge black cloak and started mumbling words I couldn't make out before he started choking me. I woke up coughing like mad and had, what I call, a "mini" asthma attack. I told my mum the next morning and she starred as if looking through me not at me. Then she said: 'XboxG4mer I had the exact same dream' She never wanted to freak me out so straight away she comforted me by telling me it was just a dream. I kept having the same nightmare and I never asked her but I think my mum did too because after a couple of months we moved away. The man in the dream was old but looked wholly evil. I don't know what happened in that house but there was something about that room. Nothing could warm it and the eery sensations I got when near it were stronger than any I've ever felt.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

UPDATE:



So I spoke with my mum about the house. She said she felt the same (she has gone through quite a lot as far as paranormal sightings go) by that I mean she has seen her fair shair of... whatever you want to call them. She said in her dream it was her being choked and she woke up in a state of sleep paralysis. When she managed to get back to sleep she had the dream again but this time I was in the room and she was trying to get in. 

The house was built around one hundred years ago. The village used to be pretty popular, it had a mining tunnel, a school, a bar, train station and more but when we lived there it was dead.

I should also mention that it was pretty foggy in my mums mind. When I brought it up she remembered it but it was lime she hadn't thought about it in a long time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Back then women were seen more as objects than people. They were there to feed the family, keep the house inviting and raise the children. Nothing more, they were essentially second class when compared to men. So it was thought that the younger the girl the more children she can have. 

This goes back further, if you look at ancient greece women were not to dabble in mens affairs (yet at the same time in troy women were living the life of luxury!!). 

Of course society progressed, things like medicine and science with it. It was realised a girl should be able to grow before birthing a child. Almost 100 years ago there were many womens rights movements like the suffragists and suffragettes. They campaigned for a womens right to vote. When they eventually gained this many continued to work after the war, even though many men thought they should be at home. It eventually became the womans choice if she wanted to work or if she wanted to give birth or both.

This [wikihow article](http://m.wikihow.com/Lucid-Dream) might help you. 

Keep a dream journal and when you wake, lie for a few minutes and think about your dream then write as many facts as you can remember down this will make future dreams more vivid.

Enjoy LD they are awesome!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Hey, had my first DILD, have some questions... </TITLE>

<TEXT> Hey, I wrote a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/3ds0j8/i_want_to_lucid_dream_but_im_terrified_of_sleep/) yesterday, explaining that I was terrified of SP so I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who answered, I feel a lot less worried about it now.

So before I start I want to say I used to LD  as a child but never really knew how I was doing it or what was going on.

I had my first DILD (in years) last night. It was pretty cool, I was in water and realised I could breathe with my hand over my mouth and nose (my favourite reality check). I knew I was dreaming so I could now control myself but i couldn't control the area around me or do anything (like flying etc). Then I started doubting that I was dreaming and my mind kept going back and forth but I knew I was when I realised how weird my location was and that I could still breathe with my hand over my mouth. No other reality checks that I did worked (e.g putting my finger through my hand). Any way the dream lasted for a pretty long time which was cool but I was wondering how I can better control my environment in dreams and how I can do things like fly. I read that you just jump and imagine you're flying or close your eyes and imagine then when you open them you will but that never worked.

So how can I better control my dream environment?

Fly?

<TEXT> I actually managed to have a DILD last night when I did a reality check (covered my mouth and nose and could still breathe) no sleep paralysis!! Can you get SP through DILD or just WILD? I couldn't fully control the dream however. I could control me and knew I was dreaming but I couldn't change my surrounding (very easily) or fly etc. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Three construction workers, a Scotsman, an Englishman and an Irishman sit down for lunch... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-18 12:29:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The Scotsman opens his lunch and says:

'Fur fuck sake if ma wife makes this pish again am gonnae jump aff this buildin'

As he looks at his ham sandwich.

Then the Englishman exclaims:

'Oh bloody hell if me wife makes this rubbish again I shall jump off of this building'

As he looks at his pickle sandwich.

Then the Irishman opens his lunch and says:

'If I get this again I'll jump off this building'

As he looks at his cheese sandwhich.

The next day they stop for lunch:

The Scotsman exclaims:

'Dumb bitch made this shite again, see yees later' and he jumps to his death.

Then the Englishman:

'Bloody hell, cheerio ol' chap' he waves to the iriishman and promptly jumps to his death.

Then Irishman:

'Ah well. It had to be cheese didn't it?'

And he jumps to his death. 

The three wives are friends and decide it's fitting to have a joined funeral.

As the Scotsmans wife and Englishmans wife mourn their husbands the Irishmans wife walks past them laughing in fits of hysteria.

This confuses them so they ask what's so funny to which she replies:

'My husband made his own sandwiches!!' </TEXT>

<TEXT> And you (yes you, I'm going to call you Mrs Pennyapple (I don't care if you're a guy you are now Mrs pennyapple)) are trying to fix that problem

I'm not going to try and say something inspirational, there are a bunch of posts there that we can all use but I am going to say well done. If you were to ask any guy to stop masturbating they'd probably laugh in your face (poor Mrs pennyapple) and if they did give it a shot they'd probably last a day and then give up and make a joke about how heavy their balls feel. But you, Mrs Pennyapple have realised and are trying to better yourself. So even if this sub is considered "weird" or "gay" or "culty" it doesn't matter because you are changing yourself for the better and they aren't. Well done Mrs Pennyapple.

Yes I posted this last night but I thought I'd add to it. Some of you aren't just struggling with PMO. You might be trying to quit weed, or videogames or maybe you want to lose weight. Yes this sub is called r/nofap but you, Mrs Pennyapple, have realised the issues affecting you and your family and friends and even if you fail at least you are making the effort to better yourself. So if you don't lose that extra belly fat, if you do play a videogame, if you do smoke a joint, if you do fap. At least you can say you tried. Yes you might fail but if you do pick yourself up and try again. Don't let it hold you back. Almost everyone here has relapsed at one point or another. Do you think those that have made it too 800 days just did that? No! They struggled and fought and made themselves do it and so can you. Keep going and you will get there, if it takes 90 days or 900 don't stop untill you reach your goal, whatever it may be. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Catholic here, hey. You're making the right choice. There are a few ways that can reassure you when you think of porn:

* Think of what a lot of those poor women have gone through. While many do it "for fun" a lot of pornstars were abused or are very poor. It's not nice to watch a woman struggling through life have sex on camera.

* it's essentially filmed prostitution. Would you have sex with a prostitute? Hopefully the answer is no, so why watch others?

* Sex should be private not something for the whole world to see. 

These make me think of why porn is so bad. If you do get a serious urge there are a couple of ways you can get rid of it:

* Meditate - This is VERY useful. Meditation can help you become calm and relaxed and get rid of stress (and urges). Here is a [wikihow article](http://m.wikihow.com/Meditate) that explains some basic meditating techniques. 

* Do something. Urges normally come when you have free time so take that time and use it constructively. Read a book, learn an instrument, exercise do anything to get your mind off of it. 

* All else failing install a porn blocker and randomise the password then when you get an urge put some ice cubes down your pants (this is only good at home not in public or at anyone else's house). The coldness really helps get it down. Finally if everything else has failed tell yourself you don't want to watch porn and then go for a cold shower. Seriously it helps.


Good luck.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I get an urge I do one of two things:

1). Meditate. I use breathing meditations. It clears your mind of all thiughts (including urges) and is very effective. It's a very basic begginers guide but if you'd like to try it you can [read this wikihow article.](http://m.wikihow.com/Meditate) Like I said, it's basic but it can help you get started. Visualisation is also very useful. Lot's of people imagine that there problems are a balloon or a rock etc and they let them go or throw them away. It sounds very silly and childish but it does work.

2). If I can't meditate I change the subject in my head immediately! I don't care what too, straight away I think about school, tv, my doys! Anything that works!

Good luck, the fact that you've gone an entire day with it in your head and bot done anything about it is an achievement in itself. Just keep going.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you. I did go outside and I'm going again soon. It's just walking my dogs instead of my brother doing it but it's a start. Ive played xbox today (playing it now) but I liked that article. Today I got up first thing, cleaned my room, ate breakfast and went a walk. As far as real life friends go, I had a great group but moved a while back. I have friends here but... meh. I don't know it's not the same. Plus when I did hang out with them after school one of them always wanted to talk about porn, gaming and masturbating so I think it's best I stay away from him.

I'm going to start writing again (I used to write fanfics). I don't think I can get rid of my xbox(s) but I'm going to play them less and less.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, it's great that you're trying. I'd say the best thing you could do is 'cut out' these friends or tell them that you're trying to quit:

(1) Cutting them out:

This is extremely difficult and a hard choice to make but you should ask yourself a few questions:

A). Are they toxic?- - -Is there any possible way I can be around them and not smoke weed?

B). Are they really friends? - - - I don't know how far back you guys go back but ask yourself if they're really friends. One way to do this is to think if they've been there for you during hard times.

C). Would your life really change without them?

(2). Tell them you're trying to quit. If they're your friends they'll understand and won't get high when you're there, maybe they could quit with you?

I know better than anyone how hard it can be to make friends (past experiences) but it's possible. I don't know how old you are. If you're in high school try joining a club or finding people with similar interests as you. If you aren't in school or college try going online and meeting people in your area, this one can be a bit awkward but it's possible. 

Also pot isn't actually addictive, it has no addicive properties other than the fact that you enjoy it but it doesn't have addictive properties like heroine. 

Good luck and you're doing great quiting porn and going even further by quiting weed. Great job so far!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe it's not for you. That's fine, you can continue fapping but if you do I'm asking you not to watch porn. It sets unrealistic standards for what men expect, many of the women were/are sexually/physically/emotionally abused (I know lots aren't but you never know what people have gone through). It's someone's daughter, if you have one really think about what you would feel like if someone was fapping over her. Of course it's up to you but those are the negatives to porn. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't get me wrong I am not depressed. I love life but I've taken a look at it and I feel empty. I don't know if that's the right word. For context I'm in my teens, high school, and I feel like I've wasted this summer holiday. I've lain around the whole time on xbox and I've done nothing that'll make it memorable. I love gaming but I just find it so boring (I have for the last two days). I've never felt this way before. 

I keep saying I'm going to go outside a little more each day (since I spend a lot of time inside but I have asthma and it got pretty bad the other week to the point were I could barely breathe. I know I'm using that as an excuse since I feel much better now. I'm going to go outside tomorrow 100%

I can't really describe this but I feel angry since I know I failed my exams. I haven't had the results yet but I failed the mock exams which should've been a wake up call but... here I am. I can still pas  if I really focus next year. 

I realise this is just a rant but I don't know what to do. For the first time in years I'm really, really bored. Xbox normally keeps me happy and failing that a good book or movie but nothing's working! 

I have to thank nofap, however. I started this In January and have had some pretty good streaks but then I've quit and came back a few times. This is the first I've felt like this and even though I don't like it now I'm glad I do because I can see that I need to get my shit together. I've also meditated on and off but I'm back on that, thank you nofap. I intent to fix all of this crap. Tonight I'm turning off my xbox, going to sleep and waking up fresh and ready for whatever I decide to do first.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When in pvp stay with other players. If you go off on your own you will likely fie. Th  larger the group the better. Try and fight others around your level, that's not to day don't figbt back against a higher level but don't actively seek them out. 

Use all of your offence and defence abilities. A good idea is to have your main hand for offence and your second hand (unlocked at level 15) for defence. 

Practice makes perfect. Th  more you play the better you'll get. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Can soneone maybe help me understand this dream I had a few years back? (X-post r/paranormal) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-16 00:36:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is my exact post from r/paranormal can anyone tell me ***anything*** about what this could mean?

When I was a kid my family and I moved to the countryside. For the first four years we lived in a small town which was fine but we eventually moved, quite litterally to the middle of nowhere. It was this one street town with like 4 houses. It was ok because I spent most of my time indoors anyway (I've always been indoors-ey).
The house we were living in was big, much bigger than anything I had ever stayed in before (before we moved to the countryside we lived in a suburban area of a city with a pretty big home, then a small town, then the middle of nowhere). Most of the bedrooms were upstairs but there was one down stairs. Everytime you went in it it was cold, when I say cold I mean it felt like ice, you could always see your breath. So, as a rule, I stayed out of there. The rest of the house was awesome and my brothers and sisters and I had a pretty cool time living there but I started getting horrible feelings whenever I went near the cold room:
My eyes would water like I was going to cry, I would get a sore chest. I always tried to keep myself calm by explaining to myself that it was just me, I got a sore chest because of my asthma, I had watery eyes because of some other reason I'm sure I found less than convincing.
The part that gets creepy was when our kitchen was being remodeled. Because of the layout of the kitchen we had to move the fridge into the cold bedroom untill the remodelling was finished. I couldn't stand going in there and eventually I straight out refused. You see I spend a lot of time with my two dogs (who were younger at the time) since I'm almost always inside and whenever they went near that room they would show their teeth and raise their hackles, which they virtually never do.
One night I fell asleep and had this nightmare. In it I went into the room to get something as fast as I possibly could but then the door slammed shut and I couldn't open it for the life of me. On the other side my brother was trying to force it open. Then this man appeared he was clothed in a huge black cloak and started mumbling words I couldn't make out before he started choking me. I woke up coughing like mad and had, what I call, a "mini" asthma attack. I told my mum the next morning and she starred as if looking through me not at me. Then she said:
'XboxG4mer I had the exact same dream'
She never wanted to freak me out so straight away she comforted me by telling me it was just a dream. I kept having the same nightmare and I never asked her but I think my mum did too because after a couple of months we moved away.
The man in the dream was old but looked wholly evil. I don't know what happened in that house but there was something about that room. Nothing could warm it and the eery sensations I got when near it were stronger than any I've ever felt.
EDIT 1: So a few of you said I should look into it and see what I can find. When I did a quick google of the street it turned up nothing and gave me the names of nearby locations. I'll update again soon.
EDIT 2 So I found it on the googs (sounds weird, google sounds better). However it only spoke about how the "village" once had a larger population, a school and a train station etc but after the coal mining industry in the area was done many people moved and full streets lay empty. I knew all of this and when I say full streets I mean like 15 houses maybe 20, barely anyone lives there today. </TEXT>

The part that gets creepy was when our kitchen was being remodeled. Because of the layout of the kitchen we had to move the fridge into the cold bedroom untill the remodelling was finished. I couldn't stand going in there and eventually I straight out refused. You see I spend a lot of time with my two dogs (who were younger at the time) since I'm almost always inside and whenever they went near that room they would show their teeth and raise their hackles, which they virtually never do. 

One night I fell asleep and had this nightmare. In it I went into the room to get something as fast as I possibly could but then the door slammed shut and I couldn't open it for the life of me. On the other side my brother was trying to force it open. Then this man appeared he was clothed in a huge black cloak and started mumbling words I couldn't make out before he started choking me. I woke up coughing like mad and had, what I call, a "mini" asthma attack. I told my mum the next morning and she starred as if looking through me not at me. Then she said:

'XboxG4mer I had the exact same dream'

She never wanted to freak me out so straight away she comforted me by telling me it was just a dream. I kept having the same nightmare and I never asked her but I think my mum did too because after a couple of months we moved away. 

The man in the dream was old but looked wholly evil. I don't know what happened in that house but there was something about that room. Nothing could warm it and the eery sensations I got when near it were stronger than any I've ever felt. 

***EDIT 1:*** So a few of you said I should look into it and see what I can find. When I did a quick google of the street it turned up nothing and gave me the names of nearby locations. I'll update again soon.

***EDIT 2*** So I found it on the googs (sounds weird, google sounds better). However it only spoke about how the "village" once had a larger population, a school and a train station etc but after the coal mining industry in the area was done many people moved and full streets lay empty. I knew all of this and when I say full streets I mean like 15 houses maybe 20, barely anyone lives there today. </TEXT>

<TEXT> After you eat anything wash the bowl/plate etc. It stops dishes from piling up.

Empty the trash frequently and taking shoes off at the front door is a good rule if you have carpets. 

Set aside a couple of hours one day a week and wash your windows and doors etc.

I realise they were more about keeping it clean. As for organisation:

Keep things in certain places. You keep your clothes in your wardrobe and dishes in the cupboard so do the same thing and set certain locations for certain things. 

A good I dea is a coat rack. Some can be bought that are pretty nice and they stop jackets from piling up.

<TEXT> What you have to first understand is that the government cannot just print money as it needs to have a value. Here in Scotland our money is worth sterling. So if we wanted we could go to a bank and request sterling (but no one does). Instead of everyone carrying said sterling we carry notes to represent them. 


So the government, here can print depending on the amount of sterling we have. If they print beyond what we have inflation occurs and prices rise. This was a major issue in Weimar Germany 1923 and again in 1929. 

So to answer your question: Governments can and should print within what they have, depending on what the currency represents.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know I'm late but hopefully you will read this. First of all I'm sorry you guys can't have children. I think you should tell your mum to stop torturing you and your wife. I know it's not an easy thing to do, trust me it's not, but maybe you should give her an ultimatum. Tell her it's not Claires fault she can't have children and if she doesn't give you both a sincere apology and stop upsetting you both then you want nothing to do with her. I know that sounds like a terrible thing to say to her but she will most definitely choose you and I know it will cause friction and tension but another option is that you sit down with her and Claire and explain that adoption is in no way evil and tell her she needs to stop, this is no one's fault. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like it. Then there's the issue of obscurity. The aldmeri dominion is the only "alliance" which remains after the interegnum. This is easily dismissed as it is known that the alliances fell apart when Talos took control but why were they never, ever mentioned in any lore book? Surely someone would have written about the pact or covenant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't get me wrong I love eso and I love the entire series but zenimax did screw up some of the lore, sure they tried to explain it but the only people that buy it are those that have never played any other games in the series. 

If you played and completed Daggerfall then you will remember that there were multiple endings to the story, Bethesda made it so they all happened, technically. Using a dragon break they made it so it was possible that any of them could have happened. 


Any way Bethesda could use a dragon break to explain the faults in the lore in the next game.

Anyway I truly believed that's what I wanted untill only recently when I sat and really thought about where I was headed in life. I considered archaeology as history is my favorite subject and I could talk about it forever. Then I spoke with archaeologists and spent time in their company it was... enjoyable but not for me. Then it occurred to me - - history teacher. And I'm now working towards that goal.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "There are many fates worse than death". This can also be said for murder and crimes. 

Take rape for example. Let's say a woman is raped she will likely have a very difficult time recovering from the physical and mental trauma and even then she will have a tough time getting intimate with someone. It can often ruin lives.

Then again look at child abuse-be it physical, mental or sexual. I read a book once about a young boy in the states. The name currently alludes me. I don't generally read these kinds of books but it came recommend to me by a family member and it was relatively short. 

It told the (true) story of a young boy who's mum started abusing him. He stressed how she and his father had once loved him and his brothers but the father began to drink and the mother began to abuse only him. She would beat him, starve him, force him to do things no person, let alone child should have to do. 

This is evil. To do this to anyone is wrong but child abuse is simply evil.

<TEXT> Well they're special because they were playable in all past games but due to the storyline they're kind of different due to the fact that the three alliances are fighting for control over their land -- Cyrodiil.

As for you wanting to go to borrowings you will have to reach level 50. Since you chose the Daggerfall covenant you begin in their controlled area. At level ten you get cyrodiil and as you progress you get more of your own controlled land but at level 50 the entire Mao will become traversable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey all, me and my friend play on the European server and would love some players to play with. We're both from scotland and are open to voice chat. Both of us have played plenty of elder scrolls in the past so we know the lore.


We play in the ebonheart pact. I am a female dark elf and he is a male nord. I mainly focus on magic (dark magic, daedric summoning and storm calling). He is a nightblade who focuses on close combat (siphoning, assassination and shadow). We would like a cleric of sorts but we honestly don't care what you play as or focus on we just want to have fun completing the dungeons and playing the game. Also we don't care what level you are.


If you want to play with us feel free to message me on Xbox:

I hope some of you get in touch but if not I hope you have fun playing anyway. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, I can give you a pretty great one, in my opinion anyway. I was a kid when I heard of this and it scared me for weeks but not so much anymore.

It's called: "Kuchisake Onna". It's an urban legend about a woman who's husband became increasingly jealous of her infidelity, he thought she was cheating. So he decided to take her beauty away from her by slitting her mouth from ear to ear giving her a permanent "smile", much like the joker in batman. He then killed her and she became a ghost.

I read about it in detail when I was younger it's kind of interesting.

I won't write the whole story but if you think it sounds good you can read it [here](http://creepypasta.wikia.com/wiki/Kuchisake-Onna) but that version is pretty short. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I woke up and I never noticed immediately but my left I was pretty sore. Yesterday I got a very short headache (incase it's related). 

I can't stand up fast or move my head fast without pain. It's at the back of my eye and its pretty painful whenever I move too fast. It hurts the back of the eye and the top of my head. 

Also earlier I saw some parts of my eyesight as blurry, kind if hard to describe. I had to really focus to see certain things. For example look straight ahead then very slightly down and to the right. I couldn't see there. 

I haven't been to the opticians in a while but I'm going soon please tell me if this is serious. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I believe so. During the Scottish wars of independence William Wallace fought for our country (please don't take  everything you know of him from the movie braveheart as it is very historically inaccurate). Here he was considered a hero. He helped rid the country, temporarily, of English rule. However, in England he was considered a terrorist.



So to answer your question I think yes but it's very dependent. I do think it's rare however as most terrorists are unjustified and cruel but then again it depends on what you consider a terrorist.

<TEXT> Not German but I've studied this in depth. Her answer will be better if they get a chance to answer you since there are so many comments.

Many people were against Jewish people even before the war, they were thought of as "the old enemy of Germany". Hitler, being a master of propaganda, used this hate for his own good. He made the Germans and anyone who opposed him look weak, greedy and selfish, only caring about themselves rather than the greater good of Germany.

Hitler was also very good to the German people. He provided free day trips and helped end poverty in Germany almost every person of age had a job of some sort. 

People never saw him as evil because he did things that were good for them and his speeches were very hypnotic, in a sense that he was a great speaker. You also have to remember that he came to power during a very tough time for Germany so they got on board with some of his more radical policies. 

Many people were ok with what was going on with the Jews because of their pre existing hatred for them and the propaganda that they couldn't escape. That's not to say some people weren't opposed to what was going on but speaking out was dangerous.

There are detailed cases of people being against Hitler's ways. One woman who's name alludes me made brochures of sorts and handed them out but she was only one woman and brochures took a long time to make. Communists were against him but like the Jews they were imprisoned and anyone else who had any doubts kept them mostly to themselves for fear for what would happen to them or their loved ones. 

If they wanted a peaceful life in Nazi Germany they wouldn't speak against anything. They would hail Hitler when they passed in the streets, they would have a copy of his book "mein kampf" on their table when they were having company and they would make sure their children attended the youth programmes put in place by Hitler. </TEXT>

If the kids birth parents died then that should be explained to them and say that you love them very much and then co.fort them for a while. When they grow up they'd be grateful that you raised them.

If, however, the kids parents abandoned them explain why they did it if it's known. Like they were very poor and couldn't raise you. If it was something like they never wanted kids then you could tell a white lie.

3). Ok that's fine

4). Learn how to use grammar and then we'll talk.

5). Thank you

6). Ok that's fine with me I respect your opinion I just don't like the idea of watching others have sex right even if it's considered the norm and also prostitution is wrong in my eyes but if your ok with it I won't judge. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Porn doesn't show real sex. It shows a guy and a girl fucking for money. Not pleasure or love. 

It teaches people to expect someone different people every time.

It makes any women that don't have pornstar bodies look "disgusting"

It makes you think all women like hard-core sex like anal or gangbangs. While some might most don't.

It has almost no benefits but plenty of issues. 

Not to mention that it's basically just filmed prostitution. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And America should recognise the mistakes they made in WWII. I do know that Japan did some awful, awful stuff during the war (I'm not Japanese) Some of it was, indescribably disgusting but that was almost a century ago. We shouldn't let the past go but we should remember, learn an  move on to our futures with a little more insight. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I want a woman who is funny, kind and caring. She wants kids and is also pretty social. I hope she gets along with my family. As far as looks go it's not a huge deal but I like long brown hair, Brown eyes. Race and skin colour etc isn't an issue. I'd like her to keep herself clean. I mean most people do but when people don't wash it's just disgusting. Weight I prefer skinny but I don't mean like girls on tv skinny that's just wrong I mean a normal real life weight that's healthy not an eating disorder. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My friend, let's call him Bob, stayed one time. He always said he had night terrors. I always thought he was joking since he's pretty funny and always laughed when he spoke about it. Anyway he stayed and after he fell asleep he woke up but his eyes were shut and he was crawling around my room screaming then he tried to crawl downstairs. I didn't want him to get hurt but I also didn't want to wake him because it can be dangerous so I tried guiding him back to my room before he just kind of collapsed back in to sleep. It was only about two years ago.  </TEXT>

1. Set aside time, a lot of time over the next two weeks

2. Get past papers, either from school or online

3. Make a time table to follow.

4. Start by trying a past paper. Study for a while (a few days) but make sure when your studying you take regular breaks and don't get to worked up. Then after studying try the past paper again and see what score you got compared to the first time. Let's you know if/that you are improving and where you need to work one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Book: 

Harry potter and the chamber of secrets when Harry and the others are in the wrong place at the wrong time

Gone (my favourite book series):

In book 5 when Diana gives birth to gaia and she becomes a killing machine so fast.

Hunger Games catching fire when katniss fails to show her love to peeta to snow. I prefer the book series to the movie but the movies were pretty good.



Movie: Finding Nemo 

When marlin drops the mask.

Game: Telltales the walking dead. ***SPOILERS***

When, in season 1, Lee gets bit. I have played a lot of games, I mean a lot and these are the only two that have made me cry.

Also in season two when Rebecca dies and she tries to eat her baby and then the Russian gang attack and we don't know untill episode five who lived and who died!!

Tv series: Buffy the vampire slayer season 1 finale

When Buffy died for like two minutes and then she had an amazing sequence where she was walking with a smile on her face to the theme song before killing the master.

The walking dead show: ***SPOILERS***

Basically every episode but to be specific season 3 episode 4: killer within. Lorri goes into Labour right when a bunch of walkers try and attack the group and then she later dies :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't worry about it I'm 16 and I've never drank alcohol. I've never been high either but that's cause, not to judge you but, I'm against drugs. Of course alcohol is a drug of sorts but back to your question. Anyway if you really want to try being drunk don't get pressured into it and don't hide it from your mum and dad. In December my family had a kind of party, my mum has lots of brothers and sisters so there were a ton of us. She said to me:

"(Insert my name here) if you want to have a couple of beers tonight don't get embarrassed or ask anyone else to buy you one. Come to me and I'll get you them". 

I never did it but I liked that I was aloud. She said to me soon after if I want to drink I can have some friends over, not  a party or anything (I really don't enjoy parties so that's fine) but just you and your friends (she said their names but I have around 4 close friends here outside my twin. I have others but they're the ones I always talk to.

I went off subject there, sorry, anyway my point was if you want to drink try not to worry about it to much. I suggest you say to your parents or whoever you live with, let's pretends it's your mum:

Hi mum, is it ok if (just say a couple, three at most, of people's names) come over tonight and have a couple of beers?,

She might say no at first but just explain to her that it's better if you have a drink at home where she knows what's going on rather than walking around the streets drunk, that should make her come around.

I've worried to that if I drink I'll say something I regret but I guess I'll try it when I'm ready but since you are ready, good luck.

Also I know I said  it but don't be pressured into it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There once was a land that housed a man,

The man was a king, a burger king.

This man was loved by all,

Which would lead to his eventual downfall...


Our tale begins in the land of resturantante in the year of 1397AD. The land was happy and the king was beloved by all. One day King Burgerton the sixth was at chess with his beautiful wife sal-ad when his young, promising jester Ronald of house McDonald strolled through the door with a grin on his face and a twinkle in his eyes.

"Ah, young Ronald" said the king

"My Lord" he replied with a slight hint of laughter in his voice "m'lady" 

"Might I ask what's so funny young Ronald?" Ask the king

"Why yes, you may" then out of nowhere young Ronald leaped from where he stood and farted on lady sa-lads face, a little bit of crap came out too.

Ronald held his side with laughter

"Aaaaaugh, aaaaaauuuuuuuuugggggghh!!!" Screamed the queen

"Ronald!! My queen are you ok?" asked the king

"I shall never be clean again!!" She stood from her seat and ran to the window before jumping to her death.

Soon after the king became a ruthless and unjust man. He banned all cola and wouldn't allow any extra sauce!! He tried to kill young Ronald himself but the lad escaped.

Ronald went on to form his own kingdom of monopolyow. Through time it grew, they struggled at first attacks from dragons were a regular occurrence but before Ronalds 300th birthday his kingdom was striving. King budgeting heard of this kingdom and he wondered how a young, immature jester had accomplished such a feat. Straight away he declared war against the kingdom. 

The war was long and unforgiving. Winters dragged on and summers seemed to span a lifetime. Yet the war continued. Eventually young Ronald came up with a cunning plan. He had a wicked sorceress temporarily disguise him as the king from the distant land of pizzerianton, Lord hut. He arrived and king burgerton greeted him happily before Ronald, still disguised farted on his face and chopped of his head.



The end. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, it's very rare. When you swallow food it goes through the process of peristalsis which is basically (the very short version) going in one side and comming out the other. This rare disorder waits till your food reaches the end of the process and basically turns around fixing EVERYTHING back up. It will likely never happen to you but if it does it will only happen once.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok here goes:

Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a boy. A boy just like any other, except for one small difference. He was an egg. His name was humpty. Humpty lived with his mother and father, both loved their son very much, however, his parents were human. This made humpty feel very self conscious and confused since he was the only egg in the neighbourhood that people wouldn't eat, of course this was a positive in his books. He didn't want to be boiled, mashed or scrambled.

One day humpty came home from school and when he walked into his house he saw something that made his eyes yolk. His mother, snow white, was lying on the floor with blood oozing, slowly, from the back of her head. Behind her stood Doc, an enraged, heroine addicted dwarf. He stared straight at humpty, there could be no witnesses! Doc threw himself towards humpty who narrowly dodged doc and his incoming hammer, the same hammer that had just beaten his mother.

Humpty ran from his home and into the deep dark forrest. Doc was still following him, he threw the hammer straight into humpty's back. Yolk began pouring from humpty's bumhole.

 ***6 months later*** 

'Do you Doc, dwarf of house white, understand the accusations put forth against you by Prince, Wilfred charmingDumpty the third and his son Humpty Dumpty?' Asked the queen of hearts who was judging the murder trial which had unfolded after snow whites death.

'I do and I deny each and everyone of them. I would never murder snow white! She was my friend, and sometimes more if you know what I mean' he winked this last sentence which enraged Prince charming who soon tried to attack his wife's killer

'Order! Order I say!!' Yelled the queen. After things settled down the queen continued.

'Doc, can you explain the giant crack on this poor eggs anus?' She asked while she held back a laugh.

'I, eh... are you serious?' He replied

'Yes, quite serious'

'I don't anything about said crack'

'Doc, by denying the charges put forth against you, you are proving not only that you are terrible at lying but that you...' doc sniggered

'Excuse me' said the queen 'might I ask what you find so funny?'

'Yes, ha, ha' he said grabbing his sides 'you said but, ha, ha!!'

'Fuck this' she said agitated 'doc, you have pissed me offer you silly little junky, we have indisputable proof that you murdered snow white, by denying it you have angered me. Off with his head!!'

'Shit' said Doc as he was carried away.

Humpty and Prince charming walked out of the court house victorious.

'How do you feel knowing justice has been served?' Asked Cinderella of Fairy news 5

'I feel supercalifragilisticexpidaliotious' said both of them at the same time.





Sorry I never included more characters but that was fun.

<TEXT> Ok, see I was worried that if she said no then her friends would find out and I'd be made fun of. Just do it. I wanted to for so long, it took me months but one day I woke up and said:

"Today's the day! I'm going to do it"

Just force yourself but no matter what don't do it in front of people and don't put pressure on her. If you do it in front of people she could get embarassed and say no.

Just say:

Hey [insert name of girl here] Do you want to hang out later? 

Or even just ask her to the movies. 

When you two are alone ask her. If she says yes don't brag about it, be happy obviously but don't ruin it by telling everyone straight away, wait till you're both ready. If she says no just ask her not to tell anyone.  </TEXT>

 "yeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssssssssss" 

Anyway don't go out with a girl just to have a girlfriend, make sure you like her in that sense. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ha, ha I get that with the amiibos :) 

Well I guess to start you should buy a starter pack. I take it you're getting 2.0? If you are then I reccomend either the avengers starter pack or the merida and stitch toy box pack. Then you can buy other characters. 

You probably already know this but you can get power discs which give you new toys, paints etc and some are rare so there's a lot to trade and collect. 

You can buy characters from the first game and they work just fine on 2.0 but don't buy any playsets from the first one since they don't work on 2.0

Most stores that sell characters do deals on them. For example the ASDA (I'm in Scotland) near me sells 2 for 15 and they sell packs like the girl power pack which gives you violet, rapunzel and vanellope for 13, so look out for deals and also check eBay and Amazon etc. Some characters there are overpriced, like Elsa for example in store she costs 10, online she costs between 20-50. You can get really good deals online though, for example you can get some older characters for 3 when they normally cost 10. 

If you have any questions just ask. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is it normal for parents to freak out like that where you live? Don't worry you're not in any trouble she's over reacting. I'm from Scotland and whenever I start dating my parents just say things like 

"Ooooh do you kiss her?"

And stuff like that in joking voices, I've only had two girlfriends but they're really cool about it, I mean they joke about it and stuff but when they've met them they've been great, friendly and not at all embarassing. Plus they only do those joke voices for a few days.

<TEXT> I think a fuppa is a weird way of saying pubes? If it is I shave, best thing to do is shave with the hair, down, untill your skin gets used to it, then after a few weeks if you keep it up you can shave against it for a closer shave. You should buy nivea men 48 hour anti-perspirant. I no longer need it but when I started shaving it made it stay smooth and I never once itched, eventually you get used to it and it won't itch.  </TEXT>

EDIT 1: I'm glad I've been able to give some away, I've crossed out the ones I've given away. I was going to do this on a first come first serve bases but since so many people want stitch and merida I'll pick someone at random tonight. When I find them I should have maleificent, venom, hulk, gamora and around 4 more but I can't promise those ones since I'm not exactly sure where I've sat them but if I find them during the week I'll make a new post. I hope the codes I've given away so far are being enjoyed, I'll keep you all posted :)

<TEXT> I have both, they really are great games. I did enjoy the playsets but to be  honest the missions are fun but not amazing. You can unlock some awesome things and do some really cool stuff but some times they are pretty repetitive. I think the incredibles, lone ranger and toy story playsets were the best and you can get most pretty cheap on Amazon. For the second one the playsets give some awesome maps like New York city.

I suggest you buy 2.0 since you can pretty much buy everything from 1.0 for the toy box with game currency (sparks), don't worry you don't pay for them you collect them. Plus the characters from 1.0 and the power discs can all be used in 2.0. Some of the best characters in my opinion are:


Violet (incredibles) she can go invisible and has some nice moves and force fields


Maleificent - when you get her wings she is amazing, her magic is strong but slightly slow which is a disadvantage but she is a great character


Stitch - he can't fly which is too bad because I've become so used to that but he can climb on walls, roll around in a ball and he is just an awesome character


Vanellope - she is unique because she can glitch around she says some funny stuff but I might be bias since I loved the movie


Alladin and Jasmine - both can jump pretty high, both look great and have decent voice acting, both have good projectile attacks and alladin can get a second costume if you buy the power disc


Merida - definitely bias here but I'm scottish like her which makes me absolutely love her 


Spiderman - I love his web swinging and wall climbing


Dash - his running is fun but a bit hard to control sometimes

Elsa - she can freeze enemies and is surprisingly strong 

I like basically every character except for the cars so I could go on for ever but a few honourable mentions go to 

Mrs incredible

Rapunzel

Gamora

Tinkerbell

Iron man

And hulk </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually they were always very anti-semetic. The people who created the KKK were bitter that the south had lost the civil war and that the slaves had been freed. So they made their robes and tried to scare recently freed slaves by telling them that they were the ghosts of dead generals from the war. As time went on they gained and lost popularity but they were at their height of power in the 1920's. Kkk parades were a common sight and they had thousands of members over the US. There was one incident in a small town, I can't remember the name right now, where almost every white man was a member of the klan and as such they could commit any form of racial crime without consequences since even law men had become members, this made life hell For pretty much anyone that wasn't a white Christian. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, I'm 15 too!! :) (almost 16) and I've had a few good streaks but I left for a while and I came back yesterday. For me it made me more active (which was weird since I'm an indoor gamer type person), I felt more confident, procrastinated less and I'm just happier in general. Again I was a bit socially awkward. After I stopped I swore to myself that I would keep doing these things and so far I have. Even though it was hard I've forced myself to only game at weekends cause it was taking up too much of my time and study during weekdays, also I go out with my friends a lot more now, I used to only go out once in a blue moon. It is difficult and I don't know if we "need" a sexual release but going without one was fine with me (even though it was hard at times). If you do happen to fap don't get down on yourself, just learn from it and start again. Also if you decide that you don't want to do nofap just don't watch porn. Seriously if you think about it, its just filmed prostitution and you're watching other people have sex, finally read some of the horror stories on here, some guys watched so much porn that they ended up with erectile dysfunction. Good luck in your decision. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi, I'm from Scotland and I will be going into fifth year after the summer. When I leave School I want to go to university and train to become a history teacher and I was wondering what qualifications I would need to do this. I understand that I'd need history, maths, English etc. I'm doing fairly well in all of my subjects, besides maths. In all of them I am NAT 5 but in maths I'm NAT 4. Will this be enough to get me into a university to train since history doesn't really require maths. So basically I'm asking:

* What qualifications do I need

And

* Is a NAT 4 award in maths enough or do I need to continue it?

Please help, anything is appreciated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks :D I was thinking of waiting till I see what days I'll be working. So if I was to work Mondays, Wednesday's and Saturdays I would come home and do revision/homework then leave for work and go to the gym on Tuesdays, Thursday's, Friday's and Sundays after homework/revision. The reason I don't just do gym or work is cause I dont want my parents to pay my gym membership since they pay for my Netflix, xbox etc so a job would let me pay it myself and get a few other things. I'll figure it out, thanks for answering. </TEXT>

We had been friends for years and I said screw and asked her. She said yes!! I moved away not long after which really upset me but at least I asked her.

"GONE"

 By Michael Grant l. It's a six book series and I absolutely loved it!! I became so attached to the characters and hated some and so never found a second of any of the plots to be dull or slow moving. Definitely worth your time. Just a tip they are read in this order:

* Gone

* Hunger

* Lies

* Plague

* Fear

* Light </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never hack accounts. I know how to but I would never do that. I also never mod online games. I will only ever mod so how player games or sections of games because I can make things more fun. I do it for my pc games and sometimes for my xbox games. Like I said though I would never annoy someone with nodding or hacking. When I rarely take mods online it's with my friends and we just mess around. For the most part I just prefer to play the game without mods because I think it's better the way it came. Gta Iv and skyrim are great for mods. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I started nofap I made it to around two weeks (I'm a teenager and my hormones got crazy) now on my second try I made it to 3 days. I know it's not great but I've learned from it. 

In the time I quit I've started going outside with my friends... a lot. I used to never go outside I would only talk to them at school and through the internet. 

I'm a typical "nerd" so I don't have giant muscles etc but I started working out.

I've stopped procrastinating... as much and I only play my xbox for an hour or so a day now (I used to play for at least 7). 

All of this is great and just because I relapsed isn't going to stop me from doing them. Even if I was fapping regularly I could do this but nofap helped me realise it. 

All of this could just be a placebo effect because I read about other people's benefits from nofap. Even if it is I don't care. I don't because I feel more energetic and alive and I owe that to nofap. 

I'm going to start again today and hopefully make it. But untill then I'll just go a day at a time, learn from my mistakes and keep the benefits. </TEXT>

I kind of look like a typical geek (which I kind of am which makes posting here weird for me since I never work out) Can any of you give me any tips on how to get upper body strength, abs and a good work out plan. I don't want to take protein shakes etc but I'm willing to eat healthier.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> How old are they?

I suggest you take them out too the movies and buy them a nice meal that they wouldn't eat on a regular basis so something like a McDonald's if they don't get them a lot. Then before you come home buy them a movie. When you get there build them a couch fort, lay out a ton of candy, ice cream, biscuits and cake etc then put on the movie (make sure they pick which one in the store). Let them sleep down there and wake them up in the morning with cartoons and pancakes. It's a lot of work but they'll love it!! 

That's if they're a bit younger basically not teenagers yet. If they're older just say and I'll give you some tips :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, it really depends on you. Both have some great exclusives and great players. I'm personally more of an xbox guy but I'll list the pros and cons of both

***xbox one pros***

It has a great interface

Ability to "snap" apps which means that you can play a game while watching a movie or skypeing etc

A lot of amazing exclusives and timed exclusives like tomb raider, sunset overdrive and halo

A great company ( MS) 

***Wii U pros***

Great exclusives like Zelda, Mario and a bunch more I honestly think it's one of the most under rated consoles ever!!

It's unique with the controller I like having the pad.

It's a nice slim console

It is backwards compatible with Wii games

It is free to play online

It's cheapei

It's good for families

***xbox one cons***

If you buy one it will cost you more than the Wii u

It is pretty big (not as huge as people make out but it takes up some space)

You have to pay a monthly subscription

It's not backwards compatible with previous xboxes

***Wii u cons***

It doesn't have as many online players as xbone/ps4 but it's not a huge deal

Even though it has a ton of great games and exclusives it doesn't get some of the best games like gta.

It can't be used for things like tv unless of course you're using netflix etc




Both consoles are great so either way you should be happy. Happy gaming, when you choose let us know what you pick and I'll play with you :)

<TEXT> Hello, first of all thank you for not just assuming that all religious people are "bible bashing idiots" and taking the time to form your own opinions. I have many reasons for following my religion. Jesus was alive, that has been proven, now people might not believe in the virgin birth or in the miracles like we do, however, I think that even if it turns out that every religion on Earth is wrong it is better to believe in something, anything, and have a chance at going somewhere better. Now that's not why I follow my faith. I follow it cause it's a nice way to live life. Sure even non religious people can lead great lifes and most do but it's nice having some guidelines. Also I feel like we have added emotions. When we feel like we've done something good that will please the lord it lasts long and if we sin the guilt is immediate. I also wonder how people can look at our  universe and not believe in god. I don't believe everything in the bible for example Adam and Eve. I think that story is used to show why there is sin and suffering in the world. When people ask why a god would allow such horrible things like rape and murder to exist the answer isn't simple. I don't know it. I don't. I'm having trouble wording this but religion is there and I would be willing to die for mine. I know that sounds extreme but it's true. I have a million and one thoughts in my head but I can't word them so if they come to me later I will return and re write/word this post. Good day and god bless. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know how you feel, I lost my dog. I'll say a prayer for you just now. I do think that animals get into heaven. I don't believe God would create them simply to send them to hell and I definitely don't believe that they just rot. So that leaves me with the conclusion that they get into heaven. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Although I'm not going to take it as a negative. I was twelve days though and as a teenager my hormones are already a mess so I was getting a lot of urges, for the most part I was able to fight them but then I said:

 I know I'll feel crappy and I know this and I know that but I want to...

So after I did it (don't worry I never used porn) I said:

"Okay no big deal, just get back up and start again"

And that's what I intend to do. This time I'm going to beat twelve days. I'm going to get up dust myself down and try again. This is actually good because I learned from it and that's why I'm not going to get mad or angry at myself. I got overly confident, the first ten days were fine so I became cocky, no more. So I'll see you all when I get another (1) in my badge and then a (2) and all the way up. For now I'm going to take it one day at a time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lot of people say that it takes 90 days (+-30) before you see any real benefits so you have two options.

* Quit and try and moderate it but just don't watch porn

* push through for one more month and take it from there.

Good luck :) </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So the past 11 days have been kinda easy for me so I checked nofap frequently and constantly reminded myself why I wanted to do this. Then today I never really came here and I was fine through most of it. You know the saying:

"Sex sells"

Well because of porn I never really noticed this and when I was watching tv there were so many hot things that I used to just shrug off. At first I was fine I did the usual, remind myself why I was doing it and said will I fap? NO! Then did the 10-10-10 rule. I was fine but it got worse so I edged onced but stopped midway and said:

"Do I want to throw the last eleven days down the drain? Do I want to feel the regret later?" I stopped and listened to some music. I now know 100% why I'm doing this. So I'm happy to say I don't have to reset my counter today and I've learned from this. Thank you all for the motivation here on nofap. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Were I was attacked by Freddy Krueger. You all know the movie right? Well I've watched it a million times and it's still never scared me (lets be honest who has it scarred?) and to be honest this dream was awesome!

So I was in the dream and he was in my kitchen, I grabbed a knife and tried to stab him, knowing it wouldn't work, I ran outside with him still chasing me. I met a girl I knew and he had been tormenting her too so I gave her the knife and said:

"Hurt yourself! Cut your arm, feet something!"

She said 

"Why?!"

And I replied

"If you can hurt yourself in the dream you'll wake up but just don't make it something that can kill you!"

So she did and all of a sudden she vanished so I picked up the knife and tried to hurt myself, Freddy still getting closer, but it wouldn't work no matter what I tried, the knife was like plastic now. Eventually he caught up and started suffocating me while laughing. I managed to get him off and ran for the hills. I don't remember much else but it was amazing!! (Because you know I love movies and the first nightmare and elm street is one i have a soft spot for). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks! I've never been addicted or anything but it was making me lazy and I was thinking things like all women fake orgasms. I know that's not true but when I do have sex it'll be with a girl I care about (at least 3-5 years from now, I don't want to have it too young). It will be much better than fapping. Anyway good luck to you :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know most people do these on their tenth day but hell I'm in a great mood.

I've been studying more, playing less xbox but still enough for fun and of course I don't waste time fapping. I'm only 15 so obviously I'm a virgin which made me think:

"I don't know if I want to quit cause I won't have sex for years"

But it's worth it. It feels like I stopped yesterday and sure I've had alot of urges but this is fun and I'm already seeing some benefits!

Good luck to all of you out there. I'll leave some tips for those of you that feel like you can't make it.

* Say "YES" or "NO" to everything. Am I going to fap? NO! Am I going to study now instead of procrastinating? YES use this and it really helps.

* Use the 10-10-10 rule. If you fap now how will you feel in 10 minutes? In 10 hours? And if you quit nofap how will you feel in 10 years?

* A lot of men on here say they have trouble "finishing" during sex because of how much they've fapped, I'm only 15, like I said, but I don't want that to happen when I do have sex. Do you?

* Think of the fact that porn is just filmed prostitution. No one wanted to be a porn star as a kid. 

* If you want you can meditate, I do and it helps.

* I'm religious so that's a motivation for me.

* Think of the regret you'll feel later.

* don't try and stop urges just acknowledge them and then say ah well now I'm going to go and... (do something else, basically acknowledge it and move on)

Good luck guys/girls!! :D

<TEXT> I'm 15, porn got me when I was 11/12. I was never addicted but I have a few ways to stop fapping when I think about it.

1. Think that porn is just filmed prostitution and that it is wrong 

2. Break questions down into yes or no. Should I fap, no. Should I do my homework now, yes. Should I...

3. Think about all the guys on here that say they can't cum when they have sex due to PMO. How horrible it would it be if you lose your virginity (if you haven't yet, I haven't and I don't want to for a few more years yet) and you can't "finish". 

4. Think about the 10-10-10 rule (yes I got that from another post). How will you feel in 10 minutes if you fap now? How will you feel in 10 hours? And how will you feel in 10 years if you quit nofap now?

Good luck :) oh and try not to thibk about porn or sex so much, I never really have but who knows everyone is different. When porn/fapping/sex comes to mind acknowledge it and then send it away and think about something else. (Meditation helps too, I've been doing it for a bit now and it's really nice). </TEXT>

<TEXT> ...Filmed prostitution. Would you have sex with a prostitute? Would you watch someone else? That's all porn really is. It's disgusting (even if it doesn't seem like it when you watch). Think of this if you consider relapsing, you're about to be part of the reason that there is a demand for "filmed prostitution". Instead don't be, even if you, yes you, alone don't take part in it then you will know that. It might not make a difference, it won't make porn go away but at least you won't be part of the problem. </TEXT>

Then the next day she's naming and pointing at my body parts when she's visiting me. Eyes, nose, ears, mouth, hair, wee lady. I'm so happy I wasn't in public but I burst out laughing! :D </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-02-10 23:29:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I'm fifteen years old, I tried nofap a while back for a few reasons. Religion (I'm catholic), for myself, I wanted a better out look on things and to change my view. PMO made me feel like women all fake orgasms and that they're whores (if they're in porn) I shouldn't have judged them. 

I made it to four days last time and decided I would fap, I've never been addicted to it, because I said if I balance it, it's healthy and I don't need porn I can use my mind. All was going well but then I thought ok one porno isn't so bad so I watched some cartoon porn, I was watching it around 3 times a week then I went back to real porn. That's when I said no! No more. I'm gonna do nofap and I'm going to do it right this time. Tomorrow I go from a smiley face to a number 1. It isn't much but it's a big step for me. I've thought, over the last week, you're still early in just do it once, no big deal but straight away I said no. It'll be nice then but what about after? So I always said no and focused on something else. 

I read a post that said always say yes or no for things you're unsure about. Not maybe, not if this happens then, just yes or no. And so far no has been great here and yes has been great in other parts of my life. I know it's early and I have no huge results yet but I can do this and so can you. Good luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi I'm Devlin, I'm 15 years old and I'm from Scotland. AMA!

***Short Bio***

 I live in a city called Glasgow and I'm going through high school. I play a lot of xbox and I love to read, be it books, comic-books or short stories. My favourite genre is Science-Fiction but I'm open to read any genre. I love to write and I spend a lot of time studying. 

***Update***

 thanks for all of the questions guys/girls! Keep asking and I'll keep answering. I think I should answer this since a lot of you have asked if I like haggis. I've never tried it, I know that's strange but I do love other scottish foods and drinks like lorne sausage, shortbread, tablet, porridge (with milk and sugar) and of course irn bru (I'm drinking some now). :)

Oh and if any of you want any proof just ask and I can link my facebook :) </TEXT>

<TITLE> What I learned from /r/nofap </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-26 00:26:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Well I started nofap as an experiment, of sorts. Now I never went long like some of you have and that's fine with me. This is because 

 I was never addicted to porn 

and 

 I learned what I wanted from this.

What did I learn? That nofap is not for me, however, I'm not just going to go and watch a ton of porn but what I am going to do is moderate what I'm doing. I used to fap at least once-twice a day, I would occasionally miss one but I digress. Anyway now I'm going to only do it once-twice a week and maybe miss it every now and then. I think this is perfectly healthy, I won't be consumed by fapping,I'll have more time to spend on other things and I don't have to fight urges like I did these past few days. 

I do owe thanks to nofap because now I know what I want to do. Thank you all.

Who knows, I might want to try nofap again someday bt for now goodbye and thanks :) </TEXT>

Do any of you have any tips on how I can stop urges when they arise? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi. I recently started meditating which is making me feel great and I've known about lucid dreaming for a long time. I hear the best way to have them is to train yourself by you know doing something like trying to put your finger through the palm of your hand or holding your nose and still breathing but I've never been able to stick with them. You know getting into the routine of doing them naturally.

I have a few questions...

* is this right? Training yourself?

* if I do do this how long, roughly, should it take before I can lucid dream

* I hear before you can lucid dream you get sleep paralysis and must go straight back to sleep. Is this true?

* does the sleep paralysis happen to everyone?

Answering any of these is greatly appreciated. Thanks. </TEXT>

<TITLE> People of /r/trees why do you smoke pot? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-18 11:36:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi everyone. First off I don't and never have smoked pot but my older brother does. To be honest I can't stand the smell of it and I'm against drugs in general even ones that don't do harm like pot. 

Anyway you all probably know that in school you're told 

"People do drugs to get high... drugs are bad"

But in my school they tend to make a point of it being a personal decision. So they explain it in detail that I know some places in the world don't but of course the teacher hasn't done the drug so...

While I don't smoke it I'm interested to see the appeal of it to those that do. How often do you smoke? Why? When did you first do it?

**EDIT 1** thank you all for your answers so far, keep em' comming. I'm still against smoking it myself but I have found it interesting to see why others do it.

**EDIT 2** Thanks for all the answers guys/gals. I have a different oppinion on weed now. I still don't and won't smoke it, I'm still against drugs in general, but I'm not going to lie I was pretty judgy to those that do now I see that there are a ton of reasons people smoke and I respect that. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-01-18 03:47:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi, I am very new to meditation, seriously I just started today. 

So my first try only lasted a few minutes. I stretched before hand breathed a bit then sat down with my legs crossed. I had my back straight and simply focused on breathing in and out. I imagined a flower opening and shutting with my breath. Then I started 'feeling' (not touching but actually feeling) my body. I started with my toes and move  onto my feet and heels. Then I worked up my legs and into my torso untill I could feel my stomach. After this I started focussing on my breathing again. Then I pictured myself in a beautiful and lush green forrest. I heard birds, smelled flowers and saw a deer. It was beautiful but I only saw it for a few seconds or so. 

Finally I stopped. I felt incredible, so relaxed. To be honest I only did it llike half an hour ago and I still feel great. My stomach feels 'funny' I don't know how to describe it. My hands also feel funny but for them it feels like I'm shivering even though I'm not cold. 

I'm just wondering if this is a good start? I'm definitely intrigued and I'm going to do it again the morning but I'm worried about the possability of an out of body experience. I've heard people can have horrible visions and some feel connected to their hody through a thin chord. To be honest I feel fine about the visions but the obe scares me. 

Is it possible to have one through meditation? If so is there anyway to prevent it? Finally am I doing it properly?

**EDIT 1** is it weird for me to feel this happy? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I have a friend on the internet (through xbox) who recently lost a friend to cancer. He said his brother was a Buddhist monk and taught him how to meditate. He seemed to be dealing with his friends death pretty well although he was obviously saddened.

Anyway I've heard him speak of meditation a few times now. I've done it once before but I was like half asleep and never knew what I was doing. 

I was intrigued so I read up on some basic mediation. I stretched. Felt my body parts. Breathed calmly. I took my self to a forrest in my mind and just relaxed. It only lasted for a few minutes if that but it was really nice feeling and I'm catholic, I've been told meditation is good for religion which I'll definitely have to look into but this looks promising for me. </TEXT>

1. Is it rewarding? I like to think it would be but I don't want to go into it and be disappointed

2. What don't you like about it?

3. What is your favourite thing about it?

Also I want to either teach at a primary school age (elementary) or as a history teacher in a high school.

<TEXT> He was looking at pictures of women in thongs were spiderman was walking behind them and he said:

"Yeah, I have a whole subreddit for superhero thong shots"

Other people wouldn't have got that joke. After the episode aired I checked and someone had already made a new subreddit for superhero thong shots...

<TEXT> Okay so I'm from Scotland and I'm in high school. In two weeks time I have prelims, they are essentially practice exams but they're still important cause, well I won't get into it but failing them is bad.

Anyway I'm a pretty smart guy and I never really fail tests but when it comes to exams my mind kind of blocks. I really don't want to fail.

Also I play way to much xbox, I know this but when I have to choose between studying and xbox 7/8 times out of 10 I'll go with xbox even though I know it's the wrong choice.

Anyway I need to know how I can force myself to study and not sit on xbox/reddit.

P.s please don't tell me to pull out my xbox plug I've tried that.

<TEXT> Hey everyone, I'm a HUGE xbox fan. I've had the original and 360 since their launches. I was going to get the xbox one on launch day but decided to wait a year because that's when the games I wanted came out. Anyway I know about the ability to video gameplay and upload it to skydrive and youtube but is it easy to use? 

Can you... add in music?
... make and intro?

Also can you tell me any cool features that you can use with it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay so I'm 15 and I've wanted to be a doctor for as long as I can remember. My twin brother has cerebal pulsey (I think that's how you spell it) and slight autism. He can walk and talk and do everything everyone else can do to some degree but when we were young he was in the hospital for an operation and I knew after that, that I wanted to be a doctor.

Anyway I've been well on track. You know highest grades in all my classes and getting great reports but I don't think I'm up to it. I've always been a gamer, seriously I got the original xbox when I was 5 and before that I had the ps2 anyway I've always been able to balance school and gaming but now I find myself on my xbox and writing fanfictions more than anything. 

My grades have started slipping and I know if I stopped gaming I could probably get them back but I don't want to stop completely. Also I have pretty severe asthma so I miss quite alot of school during the winter when it gets bad which makes catching up hard aswell.

I still want to be a doctor but even if I put in the work I don't think I could make it so I would rather focus on something else and pass rather than try for years and fail.

I love writing and I love history. I've considered becoming a history teacher but I don't know if I would enjoy teaching the same stuff over and over again for years. So I thought about becoming a writer but I'm not sure if I would like to write a book or work for a company or anything else. I've started stressing because I don't know what my future will hold and to be honest I'm scared I'm going to mess up and get a crappy job.

Does anyone have any ideas on what I could do? I want to do something that makes me happy but I don't know what that is yet. </TEXT>
