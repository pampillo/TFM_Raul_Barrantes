<TEXT> For some reason scenes from "The Painter" by Peter Heller always come to my mind. I'll be driving or something and I'll just think back on this book. I've read dozens of books after it, most were more memorable, yet I still think back on it. It's a good book, don't get me wrong but it shouldn't have stuck with me.

<DATE> 2015-04-19 02:50:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Nope. I say: 90 percent of the firsts gross.

Reasons: I dont think it will be good, the trailers them selves dont scream "must watch" if anything, people are watching just because they've seen the eight other marvel films.

The first one made a lot of money.

A lot.

Many things had to go right for it to go like that, and I dont see those same things happening again.

One thing that might prove me wrong, there's no competition. Mad Max ain't doing shit to Avengers, so it will have some time to gross freely.

Sometimes books are the best medium for story. Like, imagine that The Stranger was a movie. 

How would they show the things he thought?

They just wouldn't be able to.


I guess they could have him narrarate his feelings, but that's lazy. 

I guess, to understand the appeal of books, you have to read good books. Books that are special. And "The Stranger" is def special. </TEXT>

I'm going to the navy soon, I knew about this eight months ago, and honestly, these months have passed by so quickly and I haven't accomplished anything else beyond waiting. All I do evry day is think about it. I lost eight months of my life. Just waiting.

I quit my job a year ago because I didn't want to be there my whole life.

I forget about the past because it happened already.

<TITLE> Do I understand evolution correctly? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-04 07:59:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Don't know if this is going to be long, but here we go.

Basically from what I've retained from secondary education, science documentaries and basic critical thinking I've come to accept evolution like this:

An animal or plant, whichever, mates with a compatible mate. Their offspring takes a little bit of each of the animals. They grow up to eventually have their own offspring. Somehow there is a mistake in the passing down of genes, and the offspring of this animal has brown fur. Peers of this animals find this unattractive and the animal doesn mate.

Generations later this mutation comes up again and this animal mates. passes down his mutation. Then that offspring moves away to a further tree by another river. Generations pass, and another mutation happens, larger feet. It gives this animal superiority, so he takes over. Suddenly generations later this tribe that moved away to this other river has brown fur and big feet, not like their black fur small feet having neighbors. The neighbors meet up at the big feet havers decide to kill the others. Now all animals of this species start carrying the brown fur and big feet genes.

I can keep typing but i guess that this is good enough, so do I understand evolution? </TEXT>

How do sea/shore duty rotations work? Rate I'm going in to is 36/36, so what if I have a month left at a sea command but six months left total in my contract, would I have to go to a new shore command for only five months and then separate or would i just finish out my contract at the current command?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Going in as AG soon as an E3, contract is for 4/4 years, my A school is only a three or four months long and there is possibility of going to C school at around the third year of service mark. My questions are: 

Do the 9 months of C school count for the 36 month shore duty tour?

If I attend the C school with only a year left in my contract how much would I need to extend?

How strict are the 36/36 sea/shore rotations? what if I'm at the 35th month of a rotation and my contract is up six months, do I get sent to a new command for the last months of my contract or do I just spend the end of my career at that last command?

I'm reading a book right now and came across this quote, felt fitting for most of us here in DEP or about to do something new: "Forget about what you are escaping from, reserve your anxiety for what you are escaping to" Michael Chabon "The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay" </TEXT>

Odd how there can be such a wide discrepancy in wealth just yards away from each other.

Honestly the only thing to do in Homestead is to hop on the turnpike and travel south or north. </TEXT>

Devil in the white city by Erik Larson, amazing book about the 1893 Chicago world fair, its construction and the serial killer living in the city at the same time. I just finished it a week ago and I find myself thinking about the time in which the story takes place a whole lot.


The Looming Tower by Lawrence Wright, not too heavy on narrative, sometimes it feels like an info dump, but a very well written and extremely well researched book on Al qaeda and the cia/fbi on the road to 9/11.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've read three of his novels and enjoyed them all, but Michael Chabons "Adventures of Kavalier and Clay" seems very intimidating to me. Its about 600 pages and it won a Pulitzer. I feel like I'm going to judge it harder than I did his other books. What if my expectations are too high? What if Chabons style doesn't work past the 400 page novel? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most important book series ever. Strong in popularity when for the first time ever books had to compete with the internet and video games. An entire generation of readers would have been lost if it weren't for harry potter.


Harry Potter 1, made me want to read Harry Potter 2, that led to 3, and eventually until 7. When I finished the series I said, what now? Now, all the other books. Any book. I just need more stories. Thank you Rowling! </TEXT>

Is there any good novel in which a vacation goes horribly wrong? Murder, disaster, tragedy anything.

<TEXT> At my old job people a brave soul made it known to everyone that they smoked weed, and then since everybody fucking smoked weed anyways, people started meeting up to get high. I already have a group of friends i do that with, so I only smoked with the  coworkers a handful of times. All those people ended up becoming like best buddies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Working out is the best thing for the body. Unless science advances exponentially in the coming years, you're going to be stuck inside your body for the rest of your life. Might as well make it the best body possible. Join a gym or workout at home its all up to you. I started just doing body weight exercise, just to have some strength, and eventually I wanted more strength and joined a gym. Amazing decision that has left me feeling and looking great. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am single right now and it doesnt bother me at all. I was in a relationship for 13 months after having been single for a longtime, and that relationship taught me a lot of things. Lesson one: date someone better than yourself. I dated a girl that had all the same issues in life i had and then some. We constantly were having issues because neither of us had our shit together. Just fucking kids being kids. I plan on being single until i have my shit together. ETA for having my shit together, at least 10 months.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was for three weeks, until last week when my small set of funds became  $100. I haven't been looking for work because I really want to focus on school, but my parents are making it difficult on me to just focus on school. I already set my school schedule for fall and I'm not really going to have much free time for a job. But my parents keep asking me about my job situation. Ahhh, I'm going to attempt to get a student loan in the fall for some funds. To answer your question, right now at this moment I am happy. But when I leave this moment and place myself  in my near future I get slightly depressed, I fear that I might have to drop a class or two and het a job. 


Not one semester of college have I gone through where I could focus just on school. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Should I have quit my job? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-20 05:51:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm going to give the short version of the story: I was a cashier at a sporting goods store for two years and it was really fun, but in the last of month of my employment, work just started becoming a chore. The store manager was getting on my nerves, and a lot of the new employees were boring. The day before I quit I put in a request to get a weekend off, two months in advance, and then I get a text from a coworker that my store manager looked at the request and then in huge letters wrote denied. Her reason was that we had inventory that week. I confronted her about this because it was bullshit. Inventory was on a Tuesday or Wednesday and I was requesting the fri-sun off. She gave me a lot of bullshit and said "well see what we can do". The whole time I tried having this conversation with her she paid me about three percent attention. The next day I accidentally, or maybe subconsciously, woke up 5 minutes into my shift. I felt relief. My mind literally had no urge to go into work. I went to the gym, ate something and then drove to the job, looked for my manager and I told her I quit.


problem is I don't have any income anymore. But at least I don't have to deal with my manager anymore. </TEXT>

didn't read it until years later about a couple months after the fifth film came out. Completely rekindled my love in the series and I read deathly hallows immediately after. I read it again, and I think its my favorite, either 6,5, or 3.

any SciFi novels out there that are serious in tone but do not revolve around a military, or a space soldier? </TEXT>

<TEXT> ----" The Stranger" Spoilers----- 

I realized that enough time has passed since 10th grade and that I needed to re-read "The Stranger" by Albert Camus. Since I've been reading some Vonnegut lately, I was kind of shocked by how cold Meaursault is in The Stranger, I had been getting accustomed to lively characters, and hilarious narraration so the change of pace took some getting used to. 


"The Stranger" is a very short book, only 120 pages long, so I read it all in one sitting. Interestingly as I read it I kept jumping back in my mind to when I was still in 10th grade, sitting in that class as we discussed in our own little mini trial whether the murder was premeditated or if Mersault had any possible defense. 


I don't reread novels, I feel as if once is good enough, but I'm starting to realize I was wrong. Maybe rereading a book is in a way being in two places of time at once, the first time, and then the now. Or maybe I've just been reading too much Vonnegut and I'm starting to not see time as linear. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not exactly a robbery, more like a breaking and entering. It was a just sold home in my ex girlfriends neighborhood, and it was pretty easy to get in. We go in and look around the house, have sex in the closet, no furniture yet, and then she finds a panini maker inside the kitchen cupboard. We decide to take it. Then I raid the fridge and find four coronas, and we proceed to sit there by ourselves in a strangers new home and drink their beer all sweaty post sex. Months later she breaks up with me. We never told our friends about our little breaking and entering. Sucks that one of my favorite life memories was with someone I never want to see again. 

She kept the panini maker.
