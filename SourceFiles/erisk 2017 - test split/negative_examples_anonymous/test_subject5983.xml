<DATE> 2015-07-22 07:29:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Movies like Collateral, No Country for Old Men, Haywire, Bourne, even John Wick where there is tension and quiet broken by "professional" violence, where the action is mechanical and feels like something ordinary for the actor really get my attention.

Any suggestions for other intense, occasionally grisly, operatically violent thrillers? </TEXT>

I need to learn this. I can't read sheets. 

I can learn it by ear, but a video would help tremendously.

If someone can learn it and upload a video of them playing the song showing their hands I will pay them like $10 or something via PayPal.

Thanks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just watched Alan Partridge and absolutely loved it. That dry, quick humor that's constant in the movie is my favorite. I watched The Trip as a follow up, and it was moderately funny, but not constant enough to have me dying like Partridge did.

Other movies with the kind of humor I'm looking for are In the Loop, Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Rushmore, In Bruges, The Guard, etc. 

Any suggestions?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Really? I found that movie to be pretty worthless, if not frustrating. 

There were a few people in there with interesting theories and neat analyses, but they were overshadowed by the idiots talking about random shit. 

What was that lady talking about the drawings her kid made? Or the guy trying to prove Kubrick's face was in the clouds?

Plus it didn't seem very careful production-wise. It was more than obvious that everyone recorded themselves at home with mics of varying quality and no concern for background noise. I remember hearing kids pplaying behind some of the speakers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think a big part of the movie was the fact that there were plotholes. The scene where she's recanting her stories to the FBI people and any questions from the Sheriff woman are shushed because of the preconceived notion of "innocent little Amy" and the media's role in how people perceive the couple and treat the case, overlooked evidence against her case in favor of their unfairly biased ideas, are pretty huge. Especially with the whole Nancy Grace parody thing running in the background. </TEXT>

The other news videos just seem redundant to me and I don't care about any of the nerd stuff, and the cheesy format is off-putting to me. 

Oh well, I don't care enough to unsub or anything, but I only watch probably 10% of what they put out compared to the 90% or so that I used to watch with the original bunch.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Guardians of the Galaxy.

Sorry. I didn't genuinely laugh once and I didn't care about anything that was happening or any of the characters. Above that, I thought it was boringly written and I thought Bautista, Saldana, and half the other characters did a cheesy job with already cheesy enough lines. I love Pratt in Parks   Rec, Cooper in everything, and I like James Gunn as a director. I was really looking forward to it. In the end, I didn't even appreciate it as a fun, cheesy, space-opera. Maybe I'm heartless. I'm guessing y'all will think I am. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Asylum and then City. Unless you finish up quick and can't wait for Knight, I say don't play Origins. It adds literally nothing. The story isn't half as good as the previous two, and gameplay is not nearly as fluid and is full of infuriating glitches and bugs that devs refused to fix.

People will disagree but honestly it was a really upsetting release for me, seeing as I 100% the first two (which I've never *wanted* to do in a game before). I didn't have 1/50th of the fun playing Origins that I had during Asylum and City. </TEXT>

That's the first Google result for "David Fincher Alien 3 Problems". I didn't bother reading it but I'm guessing it covers it. Basically Fincher had little to no control over the film and was constantly arguing back and forth with the studio. He has publicly criticized the final result in the past. </TEXT>

 Basically it's a community of content creators who make videos of sounds that give people a non-sexual tingling sensation (similar to goosebumps, I guess). However, one of the most common an popular "triggers" of these tingles is an up-close whisper, which causes quite a few creepy comments on YouTube videos of girls attempting to help people relax.

<TEXT> I remember this guy. He used to be full of cringe and bullshit. He would make videos where he drank two bottles of vodka with no hands in 45 seconds and crazy stuff like that, and then he would upload videos saying he would never upload a drinking video again, swearing on his mother's grave. Then he would upload two more and delete the last video. Also he ran for that "KingOfTheWeb" thing where the winner would get some cash prize, and Shoenice had a smear campaign where he would trash the people who were beating him (usually teenaged make-up gurus), and he would encourage his fans to cheat and make multiple accounts to vote for him, and then he freaked out when he was banned. I used to message back and forth arguing with him and he would constantly lie and brag about his YouTube money and how he was so much better than me because he was making his living eat glue on street corners for YouTube. It was pretty funny, and pretty sad. </TEXT>

We had just ordered a desert when the guy in front of us starting violently projectile vomiting all over his table and the aisle and all surrounding tables. Eventually the ambulance showed up and took him away. He never stopped vomiting. Worst part: we were in an alcove and he was blocking the way out, so we were trapped behind him, with our food and table puke-drizzled, for a good 15 minutes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Once when I was in middle school, I had an english teacher who was always getting on to me about leaning back in my chair. I didn't purposefully do it, it was just a bad habit. But after like the 5th time she had to tell me not too, she flipped out and threw a mug across the room and yelled at me saying that she wished I would fall over and crack my head open and shatter my skull because that would make me learn my lesson. She ranted on for a good 3 minutes before she just left the classroom. Everyone just kind of sat there and stared at me for a few minutes before we left. 

The next day she called me into her office and calmy, but very angrily, asked if I had been going around the school telling everyone that she said she wanted me to get brain damage and die (which she did), and I had to explain to her that considering she yelled at me in front of the entire class for five minutes, there was a good chance that I wasn't the only one that heard her wishes. She started grinding her teeth and shaking and told me to leave, and as soon as the door shut I heard her start hitting her desk and trying to hold in her screams.


Later that year, she tried to get me suspended/expelled for racism and called me in front of the principal and religion teacher and a bunch of other staff to discuss this, and they all realized she was talking out of her ass. I left that school after that year, but turned out she had some mental issues. She was fired the next year for assault with a deadly weapon (not in the classroom or anything). Her mugshot was hilarious. Always wanted to visit her in prison.  </TEXT>
