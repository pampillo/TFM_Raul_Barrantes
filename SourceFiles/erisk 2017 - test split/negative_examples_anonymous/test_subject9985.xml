<TEXT> Hey FluffleUffle,

I've had a similar experience before where I thought a symptom was a bad sign, by worrying about it I became hyper-vigilant and much more aware of even the slightest sensation. 

Headaches and anxiety go hand in hand - you probably don't realise but your anxiety makes your whole body cave in and hunch. This includes your shoulders, head and neck. Try and become aware of any tension you are holding as it is not uncommon for anxiety to cause tension headaches, which in turn feeds the anxiety.

Have you given any consideration to trying mindfulness? This might help you become more aware of these processes and help you to prevent them before they get to the point where you get a headache.

Personally I ruined three months of my life thinking I had cancer. When I finally found out that I was completely healthy I was angry at myself for wasting so much of my time being miserable. Go to the doctor if you think this one-off reassurance will help you. But don't let the Doctor's reassurance become a crutch.

Good luck, you can do it :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep there's always going to be a physical component to anxiety. I'd recommend trying some relaxation techniques to counteract it. Letting yourself get tense makes the anxiety worse and causes a sort of feedback loop. Letting yourself relax will have the opposite effect.

The mind affects the body but the body can affect the mind too.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Improve your public speaking skills in Reading! </TITLE>

<TEXT> Hi everyone,

My name is Josh and am the current Vice President of Membership at Reading Speakers Club. The club is part of an international speaking organisation called Toastmasters International (NOT the guys in the red coats, don't worry) and we're always on the look out for new members who want to improve their public speaking/leadership skills in a safe, supportive environment.

I personally joined the club last year and I can't believe the progress that I've made in such a short time - 9 months ago I was on the verge of being diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, but thanks to the confidence I gained at this club I'm now happier than ever. Its a very rare thing for a person to make permanent and genuine change in themselves, but every month I witness more and more people growing in confidence and becoming truly talented speakers at this club.

I just wanted to put the word out there that this club exists, as it is not always well publicised. Our next meeting is at 7:30pm, Monday 6th July at Salisbury Conservative Club (near Cemetery Junction).

Please feel free to come along as a guest and see if this club is for you. It's a great group of people who are all really fun, supportive and willing to go the extra mile to help you. 

PM me for more details or visit the website https://www.toastmasters.org/

<TEXT> It's pretty tiring to be mindful at all times, but it's useful to be able to identify when you're going through a stressful situation and become mindful at that point. 

Also it's pretty great to become mindful when you're in a relaxing situation like sitting on the beach - everything becomes that little bit more satisfying.

<TEXT> The difficult truth is that you need to stop yourself thinking these thoughts. It's something that I've had to do myself and I know that it's immensely difficult. But this sort of thinking becomes a habit and it will become worse and worse if you don't take a stand now. 

From your meditation you've hopefully gained an awareness of what's going through your mind, you need to use this awareness as much as possible to identify these bad thoughts.

The next (and most difficult) step is to take a leap of faith and stop letting yourself think these thoughts. I know how difficult this is, and part of me was scared that I wouldn't be "prepared" for bad eventualities if I did this. However, taking this leap of faith will set you free completely.

When things get tough, think of it as habit training. You've trained yourself into bad thinking habits, you can train yourself out of them too.

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's an interesting concept and would definitely help you learn how to give a perfect speech. But personally I'm not sure if that prepares people for the real world where they will likely just give their speech once.

Maybe even giving it again in the same meeting after some feedback. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Jstbcool

First of all, thanks for your incredibly well structured and thought out response. It's rare to see that on the internet!

I'm surprised I missed the effect sizes and it's definitely something that we need to be aware of, you make a very good point. In fact one of the things that stood out for me in this paper is the fact that they computed their required sample size a-priori in terms of power. It's refreshing to see people embracing the "new statistics".

I didn't mean to suggest that the participants played 8 hours of luminosity straight. However, having participated in a lot of Psychology experiments myself I felt I could speculate pretty accurately as to which of the two trials would be more tiring. Portal 2 is likely to be much more engaging and most importantly, fun. I think this would affect participants attitudes towards the testing as a whole, particularly with regards to motivation. Motivation is something we take for granted in Psychology a lot and I would hazard a guess that it will have had an effect even in the testing phase.

My third point stems from the reading I've done into the effects of nutrition on cognition. Nutrition is a pretty fascinating subject because there are huge pitfalls in a lot of the research and these are often worsened once cognitive testing is brought into the mix. It's not uncommon in this field of research for a cognitive benefit to be apparent on the day of testing, but to have disappeared once tested again a few weeks later. But, in defence of this study, it is a good starting point for further research to explore longer term effects. 

If this study can be replicated, it'd be interesting in the future to work out exactly what aspects of Portal 2 are causing the cognitive benefit. It's extremely difficult to break down the components of such a complicated game, especially as it wasn't designed to be a brain training device. I get the impression that dedicated brain-training games are simple because developers attempt to make them evidence-based. By jumping in with Portal 2 we've almost worked in the opposite direction; we have a game that may cause a cognitive benefit, but we have no idea what the mechanics are which make this happen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There seem to be a ton of problems with this article and I highly doubt that there's really been any effect at all.

To name a few:

- When carrying out this many statistical tests you are almost guaranteed to get a couple of Type 1 errors (finding an effect when there isn't one). P values in this study were only reported to the extent of p  0.05 which gives no indication of what the actual p value is. With the 11 tests that they're carrying out in this study we'd want to carry out a Bonferonni correction and divide the significance level by 11 (0.05/11= 0.0045). 

- 8 hours of lumosity is going to cause a lot more cognitive tiring than 8 hours of portal. Lumosity is just not engaging enough to play for this amount of time. I highly doubt the participants were motivated to actually do the cognitive tests after all of the practice. 

- There is no follow up on these tests so we can't tell whether any effects (if they really exist) are apparent for a matter of hours or if they last for weeks. I'd wager that if you tested them again a week later you'd get null results.

Sometimes it's just the most terrifying feeling, you can put all your effort into moving and nothing gives. You start to worry it'll never end. Luckily I've realised that sleep paralysis doesn't extend to my tongue, so if I freak out I start moving my tongue a lot and movement seems to slowly return to the rest of my body. Man, I'm weird. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The thing that I find interesting about atheism is that generally they don't believe in an all-powerful God. What if God isn't all-powerful? Perhaps there is some form of higher-dimensional being who is trying to help life survive in the same way that we humans try to make plants grow etc.

In my eyes it's not God vs No God. There are a lot more possibilities than that. </TEXT>

I'd suggest doing something similar. Every time someone in day to day life asks you to repeat what you said, use this as a reminder that you should be speaking more clearly.

<TITLE> How do I introduce table topics? </TITLE>

<TEXT> Hi everyone,

Tonight I am going to be Table Topics master for my local toastmasters meeting. I have come up with a seasonal theme for this and am feeling well prepared on that front, however I am unsure how to introduce table topics to the group, particularly if there are any new members.

Does anybody have any advice or key topics I should address when introducing this portion of the meeting? Any help would be greatly appreciated as I am still awaiting my Leadership manual - it is being shipped to the UK so is taking a long time to arrive.

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey Alison_Hendrix,

I'm in a very similar position at the moment, just started a Masters degree and it scared the shit out of my when I first got here. I also used to be an overachiever and have found it a bit of a shock how much harder I have to work here!

Turning 22 is a scary age, I couldn't agree more. Everyone says your life will start to fall into place at this age but I can vouch for it not being that simple. You do have to work hard for what you want to achieve, but you CAN do it.

Take a step back from your situation at this very moment and try to stay calm. You're probably using these past couple of months to define who you are at this point in your life, and convincing yourself that you're a person who panics and can't get things done. Try to think of your life in the context of who you were before that as well. You've achieved so much already and with just a little bit of hard work you can achieve everything that you want.

Don't get too hung up on the past, focus on what you need to do in this very moment to succeed. 

Oh, and try meditation! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi there,

Sounds like you're definitely experiencing some anxiety in your situation, perhaps a bit of depression aswell. I'm not a professional though so don't take my word on that.

It sounds like you're going through a really difficult situation right now and I'm not surprised that you're having these feelings - in fact it's probably quite a normal response. The problem seems to be that these feelings of anxiety aren't serving their purpose of motivating you, and have got so severe that they're having a negative impact on your life.

I imagine you haven't had any previous input from professionals as you mention that you've not felt like this before, but there are plenty of techniques you can use to help combat these feelings ranging from the professional route to the self-help route.

Perhaps the first thing you should consider is meditation, you'll be amazed at how quickly this can make you feel physically calmer (within minutes!) and there are loads of online guides that will help you get started. It's very difficult at first but it will at least be a first step of making you aware of how busy your mind is and hopefully help you identify the negative thoughts that are making you feel this way.

I hope this is a helpful starting point and please message me if I can help in any way! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I find they're really helpful. All of the unpleasant feelings that you have at the moment are based on what is going to happen in the future. If you practice meditation or mindfulness you can start to focus yourself to be in the moment, and speaking from experience this is a huge release. It helps you release that at any moment you can get away for these horrible feelings if you need to.

Do you have a smart phone? There's an app I could recommend, if not I can have a quick look for some online sources </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah I think it was captioned something like that but I thought it just seemed a bit random in comparison to the rest of the documentary. Wasn't sure if it was actually a younger family member or something.

Still, wish I was taken under Jack White's wing when I was that age!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> After watching "it might get loud" last night and watching Jimmy Page, Edge and Jack White do an awesome bit of slide improv I headed straight out today to get a slide.

Anybody got any good song recommendations for me to learn? And perhaps more importantly are there any drills I should practice with it? </TEXT>
