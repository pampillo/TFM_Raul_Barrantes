<TEXT> I clean the ovens every other Sunday at closing. Last time, I came in and there was a well proofed pan about to be thrown out. (We throw out unused pan pizzas at close of day). I grabbed the pan and poured a little bit of butter, cinnamon, and powdered sugar all over it. Put it in the oven 1.5 times. Poured sweet icing all over it after I cut it. Let it cool. Became the physical incarnation of diabetes. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I recently bought the LG G3 and the default texting app doesn't appear to let me set individual notification sounds for each contact.

I did some research and found Textra. I like Textra but when I tried to send or receive a picture message (MMS), the app is telling me it can't detect MMS settings. I'm guessing it means APN info.

I did further research and tried a few APN URLs with no luck. It's stuck, not failing or succeeding.

Does anyone here know the APN for the MMS  protocol? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was in a dessert wasteland type place. Nothing around for miles. It's during the day and the sun is out on a cloudless day. I'm just wandering around aimlessly. Suddenly, I start to hover about two feet off the ground. All I can think is "wow, this is neat". So I just continue to wander around aimlessly but now I'm also floating. Now everything is suddenly dark but not like night time dark but like bad storm clouds dark. I'm now paralyzed. After a few seconds I'm moving but I'm not in control. I'm turned around after hearing a child's voice scream "Help me!" The voice sounded very distant, though it was two feet behind me. Directly behind me is a set of prison bars that only appear about six bars wide but I knew it would be impossible to get around. behind these bars is the child that screamed. He doesn't have eye balls, just sockets. He screams again and that scream sounds distant again. Then I start to scream a high pitched wail like a higher pitch than I can accomplish while awake. I do this scream in my dream and for real to the point it wakes up my wife. It's like a ghostly sound. I have a lot of dreams like this. The surroundings are slightly different but the base idea is the same. I'm floating around and suddenly I can't control where I go and there is always a kid trapped somewhere screaming for help then I scream. My wife wakes me up and then I can't sleep for a couple hours. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll tell you what my parents taught me. Every morning look in the mirror. If you're satisfied with what you're looking at, you've failed. What I mean is deeper than appearance. Are you better at your job/classes? Are you a better you than yesterday? Have you improved in any little way since yesterday? If you don't think you've improved yourself in twenty four hours, you aren't trying hard enough. Everyone struggles with something everyday. You'll never be perfect at anything but you still must be great at something. Don't worry how good Joe down the road is at x, just focus on how well you are at xyz. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Stop acting as though just because we're never going to know the pain of childbirth that any pain we do experience isn't pain. Getting kicked in the nuts doesn't hurt any less just because we'll never give birth. It still hurts like Hell. Saying stuff like "well, it's not like you pushed a human out of yourself" belittles our pain like that changes things. "At least you don't have to have periods". Just in case you were wondering, yes my pain is still just as painful. I'm still just as sore. It still Fucking hurts. I've never insinuated that getting kicked in the nuts is the same as child birth or periods. That's because my pain is exclusively a man's pain as your pain is exclusively a woman's pain. Neither gender will know the other's pain. Stop talking down what men go through. </TEXT>

<TITLE> 2004 Chrysler Sebring 2.4 liter coolant issue </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-07 05:26:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I deliver pizzas for a living so my car is my job. I've been losing coolant as though I've got an endless supply. I have spotted where it's ending up but not the actual leak source. Wherever it's leaking from the coolant falls onto other parts (I can't see the entire drip path and the hoses and what not are too tight together to fit my hand between) and the coolant makes its way under my car. So basically I'm having trouble locating the actual source of the leak. I do not own any pressure test device and the cheapest one I can find around me costs as much as a new radiator. I just want to know if there are any tips anyone can give me on finding the source of the leak. All help is greatly appreciated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My parents needed me to stay with my uncle Robert and his boyfriend Lee at their apartment for a few days. The first night was fun, we all hung out in their room playing Nintendo 64, eating malted milk balls, and drinking soda. Then I had to go to bed. In a lonely dark room with a painting of some guy. This painting was weird to me and I couldn't sleep with it hanging right next to the bed. It was dark.

The door opened slightly letting some of the light in from the hall. Then a shadow blocked the light. It was dark.
My uncle walked into the room. He asked why I was still awake. I said the painting bothered me. It was dark. He confessed the painting bothered him too.      

Uncle Bobby sat beside me on the bed. He asked me if I would do something for him. It was dark.

I laid there quietly. He grabbed my hand and asked if I would keep a secret. I froze. It was dark.

He reached under the blanket. I felt his clammy hand get a light grip. As he gripped his target, he whispered "don't tell." He took the hand he held and moved it to himself and made me grip him as he whispered "up and down." It was dark. </TEXT>

Sometimes, I'd dig in a different direction once I got in and it'd be like a mining adventure and I'd find little stuff that was buried. One time I found a gold watch and someone's time capsule. There were old baseball cards, an old knife (Vietnam war era), and a small bag of "marbles" which turned out to be diamonds all in the time capsule. My dad sold the diamonds for about $500.

They spray you with Faygo throughout the show, and at the end, poured fucking glitter on everyone.

Disclaimer: these are my own opinions. They do not make me right nor do they make me wrong.

1. Scrubs - it outlines the base idea of the show. No one can work in such an environment on their own. No one should try to be "superman" and do everything themselves.
2. Ground floor - it's just really fun and that's what the show is.
3. Breaking Bad - it's very mysterious and tense while also mellow. It also has a desert feel to it, which is logical  since that's where it mainly takes place. I don't think anyone could have picked a better theme song for the show. </TEXT>

If you fit into one of the following categories, you are a completely helpless dumbass who doesn't deserve a computer:

1. People who can't disassemble and reassemble a computer for maintenance. (Removing dust, diagnosing power issues, etc.)
2. People who can't build their own computer
3. People who think "just turn it off then on again" will actually solve every problem with a computer

Reasoning: There are too many tutorials on YouTube and the rest of the internet for this simple stuff. I've contributed to a handful of these tutorials for those who don't know how to. You are a dumbass if you willingly decide to act as though you can't figure it out. There are text only tutorials, text and picture tutorials, and video tutorials. </TEXT>

Edit: I received a lot more responses than I had expected. Thanks guys. A lot of suggestions were new names to me. I should have thought to mention that I've seen Louis CK, Bill Burr and Jim Gaffigan. Thanks again and keep them coming. </TEXT>

<TITLE> People who bitch about college. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-14 08:54:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have read enough crap on Reddit in general about people bitching about college. I'm tired of it. I wish I could go to college. Due to my financial situation, I can't afford college and federal aid won't pay for it because the formula doesn't take certain things into consideration. I have rent, a cell phone, a car note, utilities, car insurance, gas, and groceries. 

For those who might make the "cell phones are luxury" argument read ahead. Ten years ago, I would agree they were indeed a luxury. With the cost of cell service being lower than home phone service it's smarter to have cell service. Also, if I'm out and about and a potential employer calls, 9 times out of ten they skip on to the next applicant. I have to be easily reachable.

Before anyone mentions public transportation as a cheaper alternative to owning a vehicle. The area I live doesn't have public transportation. There aren't any city busses. No taxi service. Nothing. Also, the police are hardasses when it comes to walking anywhere without a sidewalk. There are very few sidewalks. Bike lanes don't exist here. Basically, the only option is to drive or never leave home unless you have a friend that'll taxi for you. All my friends live two+ hours away.

Back to the original rant.

People bitch and whine about going to college. These people don't realise the opportunity they have. These people don't realize how many people can't be in college that want to.  I'd love to go to college. I don't give a damn about mid terms and exams. I was born into a poor family which meant working hard to get a job that barely gets me by. I have to break my back to half way make ends meet. I'd love to have the opportunity to have a career in a field of my choosing and make more money working. Stop fucking whining about such a great opportunity. Fuck you and your ungrateful ass. Fuck F.A.F.S.A. for being so restricted and telling me that my family should help out financially. I'm fucking applying because my family CAN'T afford to help out. Why the fuck would I apply for F.A.F.S.A. if I could afford college? I hate that college is so damn expensive but is needed to get a decent paying wage.

That's all I have to say about that. </TEXT>

Well one time, I did that and flipped forward over my bike. As a natural reaction, I extended my arms forward directly in front of my face. Both shoulders were sprained.

<TEXT> I play a drinking game called "Last". Anyone playing must be standing. Everyone gets two shot glasses of liquor (preferably the same stuff for everyone). Everyone shoots the liquor at the same time and refills. Then repeat. Keep repeating until someone falls or quits. Then all the remaining participants add a third shot and continue repeating. For every quitter, add an extra shot per remaining person. The last player left only wins if he/she can drink the final round. I win every time.

For example: if the game starts with 6 people and each has 2 shots. One player quits = 3 shots(per player)/5 players. Another loser  = 4 shots (per player)/4 players. Next 5 shots per player with 3 players. Then 6 shots each for 2 players. When one of the two quits, the other is the potential winner. So the potential winner has to then consume 7 shots to be declared the winner.

This game gets its name for two reasons.

1. When people drink with me, it's the last game they wanna play.
2. You must drink the last round to be the winner.

Tl;dr: This game is for high tolerance drinkers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This reminds me of the time I went into a beginner's class for cooking. I went with a friend and he was actually a beginner. I am a professional chef with my own restaurant. Well, at first I impressed the teacher until my friend caught on and was doing better than me. It infuriated me. I wanted validation from the random stranger/teacher. My stupid friend got all the attention. My restaurant had gotten a bad review in the local newspaper. I brought this up and the teacher mentioned she loves my restaurant so I finally got my validation.

Edit: I just remembered that wasn't me, it was Monica on an episode of Friends. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If I have something to wake up for then I just don't go back to sleep. It's called being responsible for your obligations. Grow up and learn that life isn't meant to be wasted on sleep. Unless you're younger than 5 years old, you should have enough sense to know you can't just ignore life and go back to sleep. If you can't handle whatever it is you're waking up for, then you don't need/want it bad enough. I work 60+ hours a week and go to school 10 hours a week. I have a house to maintain and food that doesn't cook itself. I get about 4-5 hours of sleep per night sometimes less. I know to have a house to maintain and food to cook, I have to work as much as I do. If I want these things without having to work as much, I have to complete my education to have the higher paying position. If I'm late for work or school, I risk those things. I wake up and stay awake. I'm aware this won't be a popular post and not just for grammatical reasons. I'm simply expressing my thoughts as a response to the original question.

TL;DR: ranting about sleep. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just don't go with beer cans in a bath. Especially if it's because you can't handle the recent death of someone close to you. Then you'll try and offer one to someone who comes to check on you and you'll have to sip off multiple beers until you find one that isn't just bath water. You might then decide to have your brother fill the toilet with ice and fresh beers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When my dad and mom divorced and he met the woman who became my step mom, we all lived together (minus biological mom). I'll call step mom Charlene. Charlene worked from home and her employer paid for the internet connection. They also provided the 2 computers for the house. They had all the internet history monitored. They'd have screenshots of the history. She would get in lots of trouble if there was inappropriate content (porn) on the pcs. I was 17 so naturally I was a fiend. Since no tricks worked (incognito didn't work either) I would get playboys. I had a stash for them and all was good. Charlene always snooped around my room when I was at work. She found my stash and she and my dad had a talk with me. This pissed me off because I had urges and I wasn't risking her job, I had the decency to hide the mags and I wasn't getting any chicks pregnant. My playboys were harmless. I'm human dammit! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Grandmas and weed... oh the memories.
I remember growing up and going to grandma's trailer on the Mississippi gulf coast. We would go there as a family from New Orleans one or two weekends a month and stay the whole weekend. Her trailer had a very unique smell. I could never pinpoint it. All the adults would go to her room for a couple hours at a time. My siblings and I would hang out in the living room being kids and I would lay on the floor wondering what that wonderfully unique smell was. Fast forward to when I was 13 or 14 smoking weed for the first time and I got a big whiff and suddenly, I was at grandma's trailer. That smell brought me back instantly. Good times. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If a potential employer hands you a consent for release of background info and it doesn't say "criminal" background or anything similar, and you have criminal charges against you they won't find that stuff. A standard background check only looks for recent addresses and places of employment to verify what you put in the application. Most companies don't actually call previous employers anymore. If the form does ask about criminal charges and you have a pending charge, it either won't show up or they have to ignore it if it does because it's not a confirmed charge. The previous information is only good in certain areas. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I took the front left tire off and looked at the brake caliper. There's supposed to be two bolts holding it to the rotor. The bottom one was missing which caused the thing to jamb up.

A little back story: A couple weeks back I had to replace the battery. On this make and model the battery is accessed from behind the wheel well. I had to remove the splash guard to get to it. Well the previous owner must've really fucked up the little plastic bolts that hold it together because I had to break some of them off too remove the splash guard. When I finished putting in the new battery, the splash guard couldn't be completely re-attached. About a week after that I had to replace the front brake pads. I did so and went about my business. Afterward, as I would ride around I'd hear this thumping sound and was worried but my wife suggested it was just the loose splash guard and bumper so I accepted that in hopes she was right. Then I ran into the problem I typed in my question above and was truly worried obviously. Well apparently I didn't tighten the bottom bolt mentioned earlier. So with running into the bigger issue I was able to fix both problems with one solution. I learned the thumping was the loose bolt allowed to much movement for the caliper which caused the thumping noise. When the bolt finally came out whenever/wherever it did caused the brake to jamb. I hope if anyone is unfortunate to have this problem, that they find this solution. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with you on that. That's fact for a lot of things. If you pay $5 for x item and replace it 3 times a year. You just spent $15 plus tax and the gas to make multiple trips to the store or shipping fees on the internet on the "cheaper" product. If you go ahead and buy the $20 version of the same product, you'll save more on the long run. I spend more on my tv, computer, hdmi cables, car parts, etc because they'll last significantly longer and usually have protection plans. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. If you truly want something you'll work hard for it. If you don't feel like working for it, you don't want/need it.
2. Take pride in what you do, regardless of what that may be. Even if it seems "menial". Have a great deal of self respect when doing it. The only person's opinion (that matters) about you doing a "menial" job, is yours.
3. When you're young and see adults being successful, don't expect to just become a successful adult. Don't get discouraged just because you aren't filling those shoes. That/those adult(s) didn't start that way. Hard work was a big part of it. Quitting because you didn't get there quick enough is pathetic. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was driving my car as usual this morning without any issues. I went around town and didn't have any problems. I came back to my apartment and drove to the apartment's dumpsters to clean my car out. When I went to leave the dumpsters and get back on the road, I started to back out and my car suddenly stopped like something was behind the tires. I got out of my car and checked thoroughly behind each tire. Nothing was in my way do I tried again. No luck. I drove forward at an angle and tried again. Still nothing. I kept changing angles and still nothing. I finally got away from the dumpster and parked by my apartment. I've been trying to figure out what's wrong but I'm getting no where. It also stops suddenly if I put it in neutral. In neutral, my car should start to go in reverse due to the slope in the parking spaces here. If anyone could give feedback I'd really appreciate it.

<TEXT> I usually can edit my posts but... reference the last bit of the topic. 4 am so on... Shoes are simple swap out for the desired pair and either hide old shoes under rack or in the box and pot the box under many boxes especially boxes of expensive shoes. These are purchased less often = more time to make the shoes "yours". Make them look used enough. Also, if your Wal-Mart employs careless people, bonus. Have two pairs of jeans, one wrapped inside the other. Change into one pair, wrap old jeans in the other new ones. Hide like with the shoes.
Put on a jacket/hoodie after removing the tags but do it around zero cameras. Walk around like it's yours.

This method is brought to you as the wardrobe method.

<TITLE> Some things I learned. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-03 10:57:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A friend of mine does a lot of shoplifting and gaining things in a not so legal manner.

My friend, let's call him Bob.
Bob uses multiple methods to get things he wants and can't afford or doesn't wanna pay for. These things include Blu-ray players, pc software, portable hard drives, cell phone cases/other accessories, and other things such as these.

The shoplifting is done at Wal-Mart.
If it's small enough to fit in his pants pocket then obviously... if it's a little big for pants or coat pocket but still small enough, his wife puts it in her purse. Oh, did I mention he's married and he and his wife work together? Well let me mention it. Bob's married and he and his wife work together. If it's still too big for her purse then they use what they call the mark down method (mdm). The mdm is finalized at self checkout. By the way, Bob's wife's purse is actually a subtle looking diaper bag so plenty of space and lots of pockets. Anyway. The mdm as mentioned earlier has two ways of being done. Either they locate an item that is 1. Significantly cheaper than the targeted item. 2. Has a bar code sticker that can easily be peeled. If both requirements are met, they peel the bar code sticker off the cheaper item and cover the target's bar code sticker. They've used this first example of mdm for things like vacuums (Dyson) all the way to counter top appliances like blenders and crock pots.
Mdm#2: For large in size but slightly cheaper items they still can't afford/refuse to pay for. Usually food items/extra groceries. Bob and his wife locate and memorize a large enough produce item and memorize its plu code or the go to banana (4011). The rest of this method is self explanatory. (Self checkout with the volume muted).

You know the little plastic boxes that hold smaller easier but more costly products such as large capacity flash memory devices? The ones that usually hang from the wire rack and have the grey lid. You know, the clear hard plastic ones that usually contain video games or pc software or whatever! Well the alarm thing by the doors at the Wal-Mart here are crap. There are two sets of alarm things due to the entrance being so wide. Well if the product is carried just right in between both sets, it won't go off. Bob and his wife have gotten out with butt tons of merchandise this way. As long as it fits in her purse, out the door it goes.

If my grammar sucks, oh well. It's 4 am and I refuse to sleep because I haven't experienced sleep paralysis in a few days and just read a thread on /r/askreddit about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have sleep paralysis almost every night. Sometimes it includes a demon of sorts and sometimes it's just the paralysis. There's been times where it's a guy that's about as big as Arnold Schwarzenegger back in the eighties. He usually hides in the corner of the room dry humping a bed that only exists with him. He wears a hat like a drill sergeant. Other times it's an evil presence without any shadow or physical appearance. The evil presence is always accompanied by a feeling of something weighing me down like pressure on my chest. There's been times where it's a shadow that whispers my name. I end up asking my wife if it was her though really I know what it was.
When this happens I watch comedy on Netflix to clear my mind and get back to sleep. I discovered new (to me) comedians like John Pinette with this method.

I'm not sure if it's related to sleep paralysis, but I have dreams accompanied by sleep paralysis like symptoms at the end of a dream. Such dreams involve me living life as usual and suddenly I'm transported to a different place. This place is usually a desert and it's usually dark. I can only see about a five foot radius around myself and everything else is pitch black but not like night black but sharpie marker black. I just start floating around and of course I find it fun... at first. Then I float to this area that has like prison bars behind me. I can't control the floating anymore and it's creepy. I then hear a little kid's voice whispering and screaming all at once. The kid is whisper screaming "help me, please!" "Please help!" I turn around and behind the bars is a little kid, terrified. The kid's eyes are just eye sockets and blood drips down from the sockets. I scream a very high pitched scream that can be heard in the waking world. It's a scream I can not mimic while awake. Before my wife wakes me up, I'm paralysed the same as when I have a more standard sleep paralysis episode. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I'm driving in front of you with my blinker on and you speed up to get in the turning lane at a red light. I was going to turn too asshat! Now I have to either get in the lane behind you and halfway stick out into the other lane or go straight through and turn around at the next opportunity. Fuck everyone who does this! The person driving in front of you has priority in this situation. You could wind up in my blind spot and then there is a wreck. Don't fucking do it! No no no no no. Fuck you! No. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just the other day, I was driving with some asshat behind me. The asshat was so close behind me, I think she was partially in my exhaust pipe.
I was gonna make a left turn onto the street my apartment was on. I got in the turn lane to turn. She then proceeds to do the same thing but she got in front of me. I thought she was gonna continue to the nearby light. No. She was turning onto the same street as I was.
I thought that she might be in a hurry, so I tried not to let it bother me. When she pulled into the parking lot of the apartments (she lives in the same community as I), I waited. She sat in her car for ten minutes. She wasn't in a hurry, she was just being an asshat. As soon as she was inside her apartment, I put a bunch of bologna and I poured my entire gallon of water on her car (it's cold enough out to freeze her car shut). When I went outside earlier, she was using an ice scraper to remove it all. Little round patches of missing paint and a very pissed off asshat.
Don't fucking cut me off.
It's probably the worst I've done to someone. </TEXT>

Then how do we know? Or how do we know which animals see in color and which see in black and white?

What process replaces sight when one is blind. There must be something the brain "sees", ironically. Is it total darkness? The eyes must tell the brain something. There can't be no message from the eyes to the brain. It just doesn't make sense. The crazy thing is, I completely understand being completely deaf. Sound doesn't make it to the brain. What happens to visuals between the eye and the brain? Where does the image go? Does the brain just tell itself that everything is pitch black? </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I still lived at home, I was allowed to stay as long as I needed but my parents (dad and step mom) had to be able to view my bank account at any given time. This was not a problem since I don't buy much anyway. My problem was the confusion in this rule. My dad said "You shouldn't just go to work, come home, go to work come home and so on. Anyone who works should reward himself every payday with a little something. Even just a
cola on the way home from work." Which I did... then my step mom, within minutes of the purchase, would call my cell phone and bitch me out her : "What did you buy just now?" Me: "I stopped and got a soda for a dollar twenty five" her: " You're supposed to be saving so you can move out!" Me: "I suppose a dollar and a quarter will prevent that huh?" Her: "that's not the point, you need to save everything! You'll never make it on your own if you don't learn to manage your money!" Me: "so a dollar twenty five per week on myself is poor management? Hmm, then with that logic, I'm not as bad as you and dad right? Because a hundred dollars every other week going out to eat has to be worse financially" her: "Don't let it happen again!" Call ends. It was like having two different bosses. Ridiculous bullshit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My car battery had completely died and lucky enough for me, I had the cash to buy a new one. My car is a 2004 Chrysler Sebring 4 cylinder, 2.4l. With this particular car, you must get behind the wheel well of the front left (driver's side) tire to get to the battery. I got about half way through and it started pouring down rain. I couldn't leave everything as it was because my tire could get stolen or my newly paid for battery could get stolen. I'd be in some real problems then. Anyway, I couldn't get the tire to line up with the bolts so I could put the lug nuts on. I was getting frustrated. Cars and people passed by without even looking at the situation. Had it not been pouring rain, and about 30 degrees Fahrenheit, I would have been fine, but I was freezing and soaked. This guy finally stopped and told me to jack my car up some more (i thought it was already up as far as possible). After a few minutes of that, he had it all lined up and tightened the lug nuts so I was ready to go. Btw, I normally don't have trouble with this stuff, just cold rain makes it seem more complicated.

Tl;dr: I was putting my tire back on my car in pouring rain while it was 30 degrees out (Fahrenheit) and after an hour someone came and helped. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My wife experienced something similar around that age. Her and her younger sister both woke up around 3 or 4 am and cried because no presents. Their parents had been waiting for the kids to fall asleep and ended up falling asleep themselves. When the girls ran to their parents and were sobbing, they were convinced Santa was just late. After the girls went to bed, both the parents rushed to the hiding spot for the presents and rushed around wrapping them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was 2004. I was walking with my brother "C", his girlfriend at the time "M" and her best friend at the time "B". I was about 16, C, M and B were all about 14/15. A beat up old blue/rusty car full of ghetto looking 30 something guys pulls up next to us, I was on the outside of the group closer to the road. I told everyone to go ahead, these guys looked aggressive. The guy in the passenger seat told me to move and let him get a better look at "her" gesturing at M. I told him fuck off and bring his old ugly car to the junk yard where it belonged. He pulls out a very large pistol and waves it sound and then aims it sideways at me threatening to shoot, the rest of the group had already made it to M's house. I ran and he fired one round and missed then they peeled out in a cloud of smoke. I told my dad about it immediately and we got into his big truck and chased them down. Dad shot at them and they ran off the road. Btw we lived out in a very rural area and the entire police department was friends of my dad. I never saw that little blue car again.

TL;DR: Perverted "gangstas" in old car tried to get to my brother's girlfriend and they ended up getting shot at. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Commercials: Not ALL commercials, just some. If your product is actually worth anything, if it does what it should, great. Advertise the Hell out of it. I could rant about poorly advertised products all week. I'll list an example or two but there are many commercial styles that bug me. Amazon kindle paper white. The commercial where everyone is using it and one person compares the brightness of it to the brightness of the iPad (whichever version). I'm not a fan of Apple products but I can't stand complete and total lying in advertisements. They show both tablets screens and the iPad screen is really dim and the kindle screen is really bright. Words pop up near the iPad the read something to the effect of "The iPad is on". They are insulting the intelligence of the potential consumer. As though we wouldn't realize the iPad's brightness setting is all the way down. The kindle is a great product and can hold its own, in the market. No need to blatantly insult my intelligence and lie about the competition's product. If I had to choose one of the two products I'd go for the kindle if they hadn't produced that commercial. Now I would choose neither because I still don't care for Apple. Now example 2: The wax vac commercial. This style commercial is moronic in its own way. Sticking a q tip in one's ear canal might hurt a bit but I've never experienced or witnessed someone experience pain enough to cause me or anyone else to scream as loudly as he had. "OUCH!" really? Tone it down a bit. If your product is as great as you say, don't make alternate methods look terrible, just make it known your product is better. Be factual about your product vs the other one. Like the viewers have never used a Q Tip.- I'll end this here. </TEXT>

There have been other things in life such as this which have caused me to resent Chris but this one caused me the most because it's one of those father son bonding things. I'm also named after my father which one might think there'd be a stronger connection with father and son, but no.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> About once a month or so, I have a recurring dream. Though all the details aren't exactly the same, the main plot is. The dream: I'll be minding my business going along dream world doing whatever when all of a sudden I'm a couple feet off the floor just floating there. I can control where I float to pretty easily. I'll usually float around for a few minutes enjoying myself. After a while a sudden blanket of fear over comes me. The only sound I can make is a wailing banshee or ghost like sound. I hear it in my dream and out loud. My wife wakes me up because it freaks her out. By the way, I can not mimic the sound while I'm awake, it's a way higher pitched sound than I can consciously make. My question to you Reddit is can anyone help me understand what could possibly be going on? Also, has anyone of you experienced anything similar? </TEXT>

<TEXT> All I can say about most of this is, yes some customers are dicks. The thing is most of you are complaining about customers doing regular customer stuff. Customers have every right to pay with whatever method the store promises to accept. Customers shouldn't put money in their mouths out bras or whatever it's gross. If a customer wants to use a coupon that isn't expired and they have the product the coupon promises to cover, then you can't be mad at a customer for holding up the line. It's not the customer's fault if some stores punish cashiers for slow time. A lot of the comments on here are ridiculous. Maybe you should find a different job. I worked retail and ran into the same stuff. What was different for me? I actually know how to work in retail. Stop complaining about customers being customers. That's like saying babies shouldn't cry or dogs shouldn't bark. If a price rings up wrong and a customer complains about it there is a great chance they aren't accusing you off fixing the wrong price they are being human and just blaming the nearest person. Not everyone that comes through your line thinks like you. Some of your customers have never worked retail, they only know what it's like to be a customer. You find certain things to be "simple" or "common sense" but that's because you're around it all the time. I bet some of your cruddy customers find other things to be "simple" or "common sense" that you might not immediately do the same wary they do. Customers are the reason your job exists. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Little Johnny likes playing hooky quite often and he hides in his mom's closet until she takes a nap. One day he plays hooky as usual but today a strange guy comes over and he and Johnny's mom have sex. Right as they're finishing up johnny's dad comes home early so the man hides in the closet. The following conversation occurs:
"It's dark in here, huh?"
Shut up kid, I'm hiding.
"Wanna buy my baseball?"
No, shut up!
"I'm gonna tell my daddy on you for what you were doing to my mom"
Fine! I'll buy the damn ball if you shut up. How much?
" 300 dollars"
No way I'm paying that much!
" I'm gonna tell"
Fine, ya rip off! Here.

They swap the money and the ball.

A few days later the strange guy is back at it and Johnny's dad comes home early again and the guy hides in the closet again. The following conversation occurs:
"It's dark in here huh?"
Yeah. Shut up.
" wanna buy a baseball glove?"
No. Not this time.
"I'll tell daddy"
Fine. How much?
" 700 dollars"
No way!
"Yes or I'm gonna scream"

Needless to say, they swap cash for glove.

The next day Johnny's dad asks him if he wants to play catch. Johnny says "that'll be hard to do without my ball and glove." And his dad asks what happened to it. Johnny explains he sold them for $1000.
Infuriated, his dad brings him to church to confess.
He puts Johnny in the booth and the following conversation occurs:
" it's dark in here huh?"
Don't start that shit again you little rip off! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get the same way. It's like I'd rather die of utter starvation than to be around a bunch of people. I don't care what it is, I wont eat it if there are people (especially ones I don't know or rarely see). I'll be thinking "Ooh there's cake.... *goes to get cake* wait, there's people.. lots and lots of people... fuck it, there's a slight chance there'll be some left" to myself "RETREAT!" </TEXT>
