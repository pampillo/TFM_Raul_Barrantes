<TEXT> Just to be the devil's advocate here, horses die. People die. Sometimes when they are doing sports. 
Horses aren't beaten, the crop is used to communicate to the horse because it is too loud to use voice commands. 
Now, is it not just a little suspicious that the favorite horse collapsed right after doing a race it's done hundreds of times before? It's worth considering that maybe this was sabotage, poison perhaps. 
I'm not saying it's not worth looking into, maybe Melbourne is just too hot in November to do this. 
Horse racing is not inherently cruel. Races happen every single day. Physical endeavors just get more dangerous the more elite they get.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My folks managed a student accommodation complex. The washing machines were $1.50 per use. $1 and 20c pieces are close enough in size that they worked. 

One day Dad goes to take the change out of the receptacle and finds 70c only and some clothes in the machine.

He took the clothes and when the girl came up to say someone stole her clothes he gave them back and said "Is there anything you want to tell us?". 

Cue embarrassment, apologies, laughter and a promise she'd never do it again.   </TEXT>

If you're confused about what to do, take 6 months off. Work, travel if you have the means. Working full time, even as a bartender or waitress will make you enough money to be able to save so maybe you can alleviate some of the financial pressure.  

But that's all based on my experience. Different strokes for different folks.

<TEXT> Met my ex 2 weeks before I was leaving the country to live in England for a year. 

6 months later he came over to visit me, took me to Amsterdam, Paris and Ireland.

We were staying in a castle in Ireland when I told me he loved me and I lost my virginity to him while Rocky Horror Picture Show played in the background. 

I got the guts up to say it back to him the next morning. Very, very timidly...  
Looking back I think I only said it because it felt like the right thing to do. I love him as a friend still but I never felt as strongly about him as he did about me. </TEXT>

Then walk away.
Make sure the number is written down, don't try to get them to put it in their phone. This way she doesn't have to reject you if she's not interested and she can call or message you at her leisureif she is. It's forward and polite without being creepy.  </TEXT>
