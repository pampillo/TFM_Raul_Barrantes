<TEXT> Personally I actually really loved [Skyfall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4gdhsVKTcs) but there are tons of classics, Casino Royale also had a great opening which felt very much in line with the theme of the film. The Brosnan era had some great ones as well apart from Die Another Day. Which ones do you guys rate?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So on more than a few occasions my PSN store will never load, nor will any of the content under any of the games I own. The only way to fix this is to restart/standby my PS4 and go instantly into the store as soon as I log into my account. Anyway to fix this permanently as it's really annoying.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah it's a strange one, I guess that it's a lot harder to port the HD collection over since it would look extremely dated on the PS4 more so than the PS3 and would essentially require you to remake the game. Also GoW 1 and 2 are on PS Now right?  </TEXT>

Really? I think it's one of the most intuitive UI's I have seen in a racing game. Easy to navigate and it remembers your previous selections so you don't have to mess around selecting what you wanted again. Also the addition of pressing the HOME button to go back to the base menu is a function every game should have.

The full game adds a lot more cars, especially since they have released quite a few cars for free as well and then full game also has 5 more locations (Norway, Japan, Scotland, Canada and Chile). IMO it's worth getting it since I hear its pretty cheap now as well.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Sense8** So the reviews for this show have been fairly divisive but I am currently on episode 11 and the show has been getting really good in my opinion, the first few episodes are very exposition heavy as they are setting up a rather complex scenario but once that is all out of the way it really gets flowing. Really strange that the show went from 8+ on imdb down to around low 7s and then went back up to 8+, I am guessing that people felt the show picked up and got better as well?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So do you guys/gals think that we'll ever see a mature rated Star Wars television series? It doesn't have to be mature in terms of violence but perhaps with much more heavier/serious adult themes instead that aren't really tackled in the films all that much. I remember hearing about the cancelled Star Wars Underworld series which was in development before Disney bought Lucasfilm which revolved around the Coruscant underworld, sounded amazing in my opinion. Imagine if HBO were allowed to develop a Star Wars series *drools*.  </TEXT>

Yeah that scene where he walks up to an old John Deere tractor they don't even sell anymore which is contextually located in it's natural habitat, A FARM, combined with his character making a snarky pun... Or that 2 second shot of Quicksilver grabbing Adidas shoes out of his closet? Your examples suck and the fact that you tried to say that the product placement in AoU wasn't as bad as Transformers shows why no one has taken your opinion seriously.

Just get a dock for your phone if you want to use it in traffic, the law states that you cannot hold it in your hand or on your lap unless the car is parked on the road and the ignition is off.

Look at Final Fantasy: Spirits Within, it was a more mature animated film which pushed the boundaries of computer animation, but in the end it bombed. Now there's a variety of factors as to why it bombed (which may have been prevented) but it was a very expensive bomb which seems to have had a lasting effect on the green lighting of these types of projects.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> What real life corporations is Deus Ex:HR referencing? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-14 06:16:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So throughout the series, corporations are obviously a big part of the game and in Human Revolution they go into greater detail of these different corporations, which i'm guessing are loosely based of real life corporations who have monopolies in certain markets. 

1. Tai Yong Medical, could we align them to real life companies like Pfizer or Glaxo Smith Kline?

2. Picus Media, perhaps they are based off News Corp, Comcast, Viacom? 

2. Belltower Associates, this one is pretty straightforward as we can attribute them security contractors like Academi (formally known as Blackwater) or DynCorp

3. Sarif Industries, This one for me is harder to pinpoint, it seems to be an amalgamation of different real life companies put into one company. Maybe Boston Dynamics or maybe Cyberdyne (yes that is the real name of a Japanese robotics company, I am worried).

What do you guys think, I may be completely off here.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry but I have to disagree, just because HBO's subscription method is a bit much (although they are releasing a standalone subcription only service soon), the quality of content they produce is still unsurpassed, no other network makes shows as remotely close to quality and production as Game of Thrones, The Wire, Sopranos, Boardwalk Empire. Those are just a few shows as well. If they were to budget this show like Game of Thrones than you would probably see the most realised vision of Rapture or Infinite on television.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-04-08 02:42:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So the film adaptation for Bioshock 1 got shut down a while ago now, how do you guys think the story of Bioshock 1 or Inifite would work as a TV series? Ideally it would be awesome to have a HBO budgeted series but I can understand the high risk involved with that. If it was Bioshock 1, should it be set before the events of the first game and show Rapture's downfall? Or do you guys think Bioshock Infinite's overall story lends itself to a television series better?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is what I believe as well, makes sense as GG are going to focus on their new game and potentially turn it into a franchise, hope it's great as they are a very talented group, who have unfortunately been relegated to making Killzone titles since the PS3 launched. With the writer of Fallout NV, I do have high hopes for the story of Horizon.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's kinda strange because that soundtrack must have been ahead of its time for that type of film, back then people may not have been able to comprehend not having a conventional orchestral score in a heist type of film, Tangerine Dream also did the score for GTA V and sounds very similar to Thief [Here's an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MKvsXA94Zk).  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Do you guys think that FO4's main character should have a voice or be silent like previous entries? I see an upside and downside to this. 

Upside: Greater character development and more immersive for the player (at least for me). 

Downside: More voice work will limit the amount of dialogue choices and the character may not be likeable for every player. 

What do you guys think? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally I am rooting for the P1. Ever since I played Need for Speed II all those years back, the Mclaren F1 has and still is my favourite super car ever made and the P1 reminded me of the F1 just in it's sheer ridiculousness. My other pick would be the 918 since that car is pushing the hybrid technology forward the most out of the 3 also I feel that it looks a ton better than the La Ferrari. 

La Ferrari is the last one for me since I always feel that Ferrari are always up themselves in terms of how they present their brand. Don't get me wrong they make great cars however how the way they present themselves to motor journalists and car enthusiasts, just turns me off them. I know I didn't really analyse from a technical POV which would come first, this is just who I want to come first.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hard to say, you are condensing a 10 hour game experience into a 2 hour movie (maybe 2.5hrs max). I'm a huge fan of the series however I think it would be pretty difficult to work into a film purely because of how the story is written around the game. Not to mention the odd characters that pop up in the film which would confuse the fuck out of focus testers and the studio. I think the best way to do it is to write the film around the story and not the game if you get what I mean.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Will video game based films replace superhero films in the future? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-31 05:07:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Does anyone here feel that superhero films in the future will feel genre fatigue and start to see less superhero films being released on a yearly schedule? I feel that there are three big video game based films that could have the opportunity to be the equivalent of the the first breakthrough superhero film (e.g Spiderman, X-Men). 

1. Assassins Creed (2016) So this is being filmed right now with Ubisoft having very close creative control on the story of the film. This is a pretty huge franchise which has the potential to earn big bucks at the box office, although the franchise has had a bad rep with gamers due to the last release, Assassins Creed Unity which was released in an unfinished state with an unsatisfying story. This one could go hit or miss in my opinion.

2) Warcraft (2016) This is a big one. Duncan Jones directing the Blizzard made franchise. Warcraft is already a huge name because of the online only game, World of Warcraft. It's a billion dollar franchise played by tens of millions of players around the world. The early footage shown to those lucky people at Blizzcon have had people excited, Blizzard have worked very closely with the story for this game so this one could be a massive hit and break the video game stigma.

3) The Last of Us (20XX) This game was personally my game of last generation. It told a beautifully crafted story between a young girl named Ellie and a much older survivor named Joel, set 20 years in the future after a terrible fungal outbreak which causes people to turn into running fungi mutated versions of themselves, making themselves crazy. This is the best game to show off a mature story and extremely well written characters which are both complex and interesting. My personal take is if this is adapted correctly, it could be a serious contender for it to be an award winner.

Edit: spelling </TEXT>

<TEXT> Making split screen is actually a pretty difficult process. You essentially have to render what's on screen twice and also do a lot of bug checking. So if split-screen were there in DC it would look pretty bad compared to full screen single player. The manpower required to make split-screen is not worth the effort considering how many people actually use it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seriously if people are still hesitant about watching this show, don't be. This was one of the best episodes of television I have seen in a long time. Especially given that it's a show on CBS, this is not too common. The first 2 seasons may be a bit hard to get into as it is procedural for the most part but once it gets firmly into it's serial nature it will become one of your favourite shows most likely. Easily a must watch.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Finally, it feels that Far Cry 2 is often largely forgotten and overshadowed by it's sequels. However I still feel that FC2 was the more compelling game for me, despite its very obvious flaws and shortcomings. 

Here's a few things I really liked about FC2: 

1. **Weapon Loadouts** were a lot more realistic, you had to really prepare before a mission otherwise chances are that you will most likely die. 

2. **The Buddy System** The idea of having buddies that would help you out in combat and can potentially die was both rewarding and harrowing at the same time, even though these characters aren't fleshed out, you do feel a sense of comradare with them as they are the only characters trying to survive in the harsh African climate alongside yourself, the player. 

3. **The Fire System** It felt like the fire system in FC2 spread a lot more and engulfed everything in it's path. Compare this to FC3 and 4 and it makes them look like tiny shrubs on fire. I'm not exactly sure why Ubisoft went backwards in this regard. 

4. **Weapon Jamming**, ok this one is a double edged sword. It was pretty tense to be in a fire fight and having your gun suddenly jam, however this happened way too often. While there was a system to tell how degraded a gun was by its looks it still jammed too many times, even for guns that looked of good quality. The main issue with this is you pick up poorly maintained guns off enemies who never seem to have their guns jam on them. This was more a case of interesting design idea but flawed execution. 

5. **Time and Day** Finally, the time and day. I really loved doing missions where you had to take out certain people. It would start off with a long drive to the safe house from where you would unload your weapon cases and take what you had carefully prepared, then you take a nap and set the time progression for you to start the mission. It was really nice being able to control the time and day like that and you felt like a proper bad ass doing the set up for these missions.

<TEXT> Hey guys what graphical improvements/engine improvements would you like to see in Elder Scrolls VI. I'm assuming that ES:VI will use whatever engine that Fallout 4 will use, so I guess this question can be meant for both games. Personally I would just like to see a much less rigid movement system, the movement in Skyrim just felt super rigid, especially when you jump! Obviously graphical improvements will be seen, my dream would be to see nice volumetric clouds like you see in Driveclub, [here's an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4l39926dJ4), now I understand that it's obviously a racing game so that tech being used in an open world would be very taxing, but I think it would be nice to explore the possibility :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally the best way to do it, assuming the Broccolis sign off on it, is to get approach it take elements from the best stealth/action games out there at the moment and add their own Bond flare to them. E.g you could borrow the dialogue system from Alpha Protocol, the combat system from Arkham perhaps with an animation set which is more suited to Bond's fighting style. This is assuming Rocksteady are actually the developers behind this game as they seem to do a good job of resurrecting video game franchises that are dead in the water.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Funnily enough I saw the first two films in HFR and the last one in regular 24FPS and I think I would have preferred to see this one in 48 since there's a lot more action happening in the film. I did notice some specific parts where the scene appeared to be jittery, especially during the long panning shots of landscapes. In your comment regarding the actors looking superimposed, I felt that they still looked superimposed in 24, I think this to do with the overly digital look of the film which is just a big step backwards when compared to the LOTR trilogy. Personally though I think Battle of Five Armies serves to be the one that benefits from the 48 fps since there's not much downtime during the film.  </TEXT>

The studio would never let him have his face covered for the whole film, so that idea is out of the question. Also it would severely limit the actors ability to portray his full range of performances.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was wondering if the studio will ever release the alternate ending for WWZ since I heard that it was pretty much finished. It would seem like a more complete film since it was fairly obvious in the theatrical cut that many characters that pop up during the film were clearly meant to have a bigger role (e.g Michael Fox's character). Will this ending ever see the light of day or has the studio just buried it? </TEXT>

I'm curious if you guys felt the same way in that everything felt way too drawn out and could have used a good trim in the editing room. Also do you feel the CG still holds up to this day since that was a very specific focus of the film? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would just like to say that I fucking LOVE this film. Such a fantastic film on the drug trade. Daniel Craig kills it as the main character and rightfully so since they got him for Casino Royale after this film. Matthew Vaughn can direct man, he manages to inject a certain flavour into every scene, I can't really describe it but it just feels so well composed you know? I would urge anyone who hasn't seen this film to check it out right now! Here's two of my favourite scenes in the film both with excellent music to boot.

<TEXT> The film was apparently way over budget and was completely edited and re-shot at the behest of the studio. The original film had Keanu Reeves in a smaller role and Hirouki Sanada being the main character. Did you notice how the [poster for the film had that tatted up guy holding a gun over the shoulder?](http://cdn.screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/47-ronin-freak-poster.jpg) Yeah he's in the film for about 10 seconds, the original director was locked out of the editing room after the reshoots were completed. It's a shame because I think the film has glimpses of awesomeness and fantastic world building but ultimately it was corporate greed that most likely got in the way of a potentially great film.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A completely CG animated film would be quite expensive. Look at Final Fantasy Spirits Within, that was completely animated and cost a boatload of money and performed very poorly at box office and basically undid Squaresoft and forcer them to merge and become Square Enix. Now this was back in 2001, so maybe CGI has gotten cheaper to produce but I think the investment is still too much compared to that of a live action film. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So do you guys think that a main entry AC game will ever be set in a  future setting. Navigating a busy metropolis or perhaps a very futuristic city. It kind of seems like Watch Dogs was more of the present setting with Chicago but I think a good AC game can be made if they set it in the future. Picture a city like [Coruscant](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080610031227/starwars/images/5/5c/Coruscant_at_night.jpg) from Star Wars and sneaking into a super tall skyscraper to take out your target.

<TEXT>  Just adding my 2 cents on the topic of Borderlands' sense of humor. The very topical, reference-based, irreverent, self-deprecating, over-the-top style is definitely NOT for everyone. For my money (and personal sense of humor), Borderlands is the most genuinely funny game series in existence. I think it's funnier than most 'funny' shows and movies. Absolutely brilliant writing, IMHO. You can tell that the team at Gearbox LOVES games- there is just fan service after fan service littered throughout

Yeah they love games so much that they just outsource the ones they don't want to make to other teams and pretend it wasn't their fault.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Better quality of how it looked in film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLy7wZeqa4) I think the F35 actually looks quite good in the film, especially when it hovers in under the overpass to block the truck. It looks quite real in that situation, not that it would ever happen but at least they went to the effort of making it look real with the model instead of using CG. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recommend Arrow as well. The first half of Season 1 can be a bit silly as it is trying to find its footing but towards the end of Season 1 the show becomes really special imo. The character development is really great, especially for a show like Arrow. Season 2 is amazing as it becomes more of a personal battle since they bring in a pretty big villain (not going to say who), they just do a really good job of world building imo especially since they are going to cross over with the Flash as well.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What I mean by this is the blue computer like hud interface they had. I felt it looked more slicker than the one in BF4. Especially when you're getting points/killing opponents, the way the points screen animates on the bottom really made me prefer it. Maybe i'm wrong however in that the one in BF4 just works better since it's more simpler and straight the point (been a while since I played BF3). </TEXT>

<TEXT> This game. Where do I begin? Deus Ex:HR was probably my GOTY for 2011 and while I understand that it had its flaws, the gameplay, level design and music all came together beautifully. It is one of the games where I feel that the sequel may be near perfect if they do it right and learn from the mistakes of HR (boss fights, providing equal xp no matter your playstyle and an overhaul of the graphics). The art style of this game is amazing, the gold and yellow hues of the cyberpunk renaissance (as they call it) exude that overly lit up, light polluting world of the future. If anyone is interested here are some screen shots I had taken that further reinforce how awesome the art style simply is.

<TEXT> I'm so torn because a Blade Runner directed by Scott with his signature visual flair would be awesome but Scott is also a director who is dependent on having a good script to make the film come together. I was in the camp of people who enjoyed Prometheus but obviously felt it was very flawed and the counselor was a strange one for me as I could not really pin the film down and how i felt about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not sure about programming but Michael Mann's new film Blackhat is about a hacker so that could be interesting since he does a stupid amount of research in films on said subjects.

EDIT here's a [link](http://collider.com/blackhat-comic-con-panel-recap/) on the reasearch he did. 

**As part of his research, Mann started hanging out with some black hat hackers, and discovered that they can do 7 to 8 hours of coding in one go, and it creates both a sense of escapism and a bit of an opiate feedback loop.  But its important to note that its not an escape because their work goes into the real world and can create serious repercussions.

<TEXT> The only things I agree with you were the personality of the robots and the performances from the actors. The pacing however was one of the biggest offenders of the film along side its product placement. The film was pretty much 3 hours long and it did not need to be at all. Just when you think it's almost over...BAM the whole Hong Kong section begins. It did have some cool elements such as the main transformer villain and the dinobots but that was it for me really.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The theatrical cut glosses over or completely cuts out many key characters that are integral to the actual story. The directors cut re-inserts this aspect into the film and adds layers to the developing world around the characters as well as political story threads which establish conflicts during the film. The directors cut is a 3 hour long film while the theatrical is around 2hrs 20 minutes, which gives you an idea of just how much was cut out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well the game is pretty much dead here in Australia. You can only really get a game of attrition and that's in the evenings on weekdays and weekends. Any other mode you are SOL since the population is dead. Playing on the US and EU servers isn't an option since the pings are too high.  </TEXT>

To be fair though, Need for Speed is probably one of the easiest games to adapt into a film since none of the games really feature an in depth narrative with fleshed out characters that are remotely memorable.

<TEXT> I think pretty much all these changes are for the best. The film ending can also be up for interpretation, while it isn't as directly sad as the book ending, it can still be sad in it's on way since film Cage may have almost fallen for Rita but due to the reset he realises that she wouldn't remember him nor fall for him.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Splitscreen is very hard to develop into a game. It requires extensive coding and testing plus it would probably add a delay to a game. Personally the amount of people who would be using split screen would be minimal and thus the effort required for the amount of people that would use it is not worth it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Usually in engine cutscenes are of a higher resolution and polygon count when making the game and with the last generation of consoles (360,PS3) you would notice that the characters and environment etc would look a lot better than when you are actually playing the game. With the new consoles (PS4,XONE) this is not really an issue and they can get the game to look as good as its in game cutscenes. Hence why even though the trailer didn't show any true gameplay we can safely assume the game would look like that come release.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Australian citizen here, Jeep Cherokee's have always been quite popular here and I have also seen quite a few Chrysler 200's around. While the most common car you see here is a Holden Commodore (Chevy SS). Importing a Mustang, Corvette, Viper or Camaro is uber expensive as you have to get a RHD conversion and I imagine servicing the car would be stupidly expensive. Personally I love the designs of all 3 of those cars, it's just a shame they are so expensive.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I have been rocking my Galaxy Nexus since 2011 and I want to upgrade to a Nex 5, is the battery life a substantial improvement over the GNex? Reason I am asking is that I know the battery life of the Nex 5 compared to some new phones such as the HTC One M8 and Galaxy S5 isn't the best but if it's a massive improvement over my G Nex it'll push me more towards it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wouldn't mind seeing some of the themes the Clone Wars explored, mainly being that grey area of dark and light. It raised very valid points about the Jedi order being power hungry and controlling in their own way. I think Knights of the Old Republic explored these themes extremely well through the character of Kreia. It made you look at the force in shades of gray rather than just pure black and white. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So my specs are:

CPU: i7 2600k 3.4ghz (not overclocked)
GPU: AMD Sapphire 6970 2gb (not overclocked)
HDD: Samsung SpinPoint F3 1TB HD103SJ	
PSU: Silverstone Strider Plus 600W ST60F-P	
MOBO: ASRock Z68 Extreme3 Gen3 Motherboard	
OS: Windows 7 Home Premium
RAM: G.Skill Ripjaws F3-12800CL9D-8GBRL 8GB (2x4GB) DDR3	

So basically everything was running fine until yesterday I decided to play some Titanfall then maybe a minute into the game the fan on my GPU went into overdrive it sounded like a jet engine. It has been doing it ever since now when I turn it on it goes into full overdrive and stays like that, GPU-Z said the fan was at 100% and the temperature was at -165 celsius, so something is defintely not right. Any help on what's going on would be much appreciated. </TEXT>

Personally I think it would be an amazing on HBO if they put in a similar 10 episode season like they do with Game of Thrones with a similar budget as well, however the chances of that happening are nil since Disney own the ABC network which they would most likely produce it on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually think this would fit Ridley Scott perfectly, combined with a good screenplay of course *cough Prometheius cough*. If the film follows the first game and is set in the 12 century I feel that he could absolutely nail the look and feel of the setting as well as the sci fi elements. For reference I think people should check out the directors cut for Kingdom of Heaven as it is set roughly in the same time period as AC1 and gives a good vision for what he could achieve. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was originally like you and asked myself whether the show would be too childish etc. Then I decided to watch it from season 1 to 6 and honestly it is fantastic. Sure there are a few dud episodes and some story arcs that appeal more to children than adults but the underlying theme of darkness is present throughout the series and man does it get dark especially in the latter seasons. Seriously do yourself a favour and watch it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think of the ratings as more of a guideline. I was fortunate that my mum or dad didn't care about what I played too much and was able to get away with some pretty gnarly games at a young age. For example I got GTA 3 on PS2 when I was in Year 4 of primary school. I look back on it know as my parents being a bit naive but also as a sign of trust in that they raised me correctly and made me work for these games. I'm not saying that your mum is completely wrong in not getting you the game but I think showing that you can handle mature themes, ideas and concepts which transcend the idea of these artificial ratings, it will go along way with your mum. My 2 cents though I'm sure many people may disagree with me. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Sony have already said that the price of the PS4 was not finalized until E3, and that they were prepared to sell it for less than they are in order to undercut the Xbox One, which was their ultimate goal from the start. When Microsoft announced their higher-than-expected pricing, Sony execs breathed a sigh of relief. This was all discussed numerous times in a wide variety of interviews with several Sony execs. The prices were not known to anyone outside of these two companies until the announcements were made.
 

I don't think Respawn chose to make it for the Xbox One as many developers with Respawn have stated that they are upset that PS4 owners won't be able to experience the game since they want it to reach as many households as possible. It was a very corporate decision to keep it to the Xbox One.

<TEXT> Sorry but even MS will never pay a stupidly high amount for Titanfall 2. The only reason Titanfall 1 was a console exclusive was because a former EA executive thought the Xbox One would dominate this gen. EA are pretty much kicking themselves over this though since the PS4 now has the higher install base. So essentially MS would have to pay the equivalent of what EA are losing in potential PS4 sales and that would simply be too high for MS to pay. MS would most likely want to put that money into their own IP's such as Gears or Halo where they know they will get a substantial profit instead of splitting up the portion of these profits with another company like EA if they made Titanfall 2 </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was in the exact same situation mate a few days ago. In my opinion its best if you don't lock onto the dragon and get some distance. It basically has a tell for each move its gonna do when it lies down flat it basically means its gonna charge and when it does you can easily manouver around it and get a few hits in on the tail BUT you have to be cautious because you need your stamina to gain distance again when it starts bend over again. It has a move in which it will vomit up all this acid on the ground which can spread in a rather large radius but you as long as you are far away from him you can avoid it although if you get hit it will reduce weapon durability. You can tell when he's gonna do the acid move when he starts do this regurgitating animation from what I can remember. 

Basically just don't lock onto him and keep a lot of distance and monitor how he tries to attack you. It takes a while to get his HP down when you're only attacking his back side but it's the safest way imo.  </TEXT>

Now this is how I felt the order of the show could have gone assuming that certain characters did not die. Obviously Season 8 does not exist in this and you may be able to exclude season 5 from this order as well and pretend it never happened.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When this film came out I was about 11 years old so obviously I wasn't really clued in what people thought about the film. I know this though that when I did see it in the cinemas with my parents, I cried and it is still the only live action film which had genuinely brought a tear to my eye from what I can remember. I obviously didn't get the underlying themes or motifs that the film conveyed at the time but after watching it recently at the ripe age of 21, I gotta say I am quite surprised at how many people dislike it, I didn't really notice how divisive the film was at its release. 

So what how do you fine people feel about A.I? Is it a masterpiece or is it one of Spielberg's missteps? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi guys now first and foremost I am not a heavy drinker at all, I am only 21 and studying at university so I only drink heavy on occasion to celebrate or party etc, now I am not looking to make fun or offend anyone here but my main question is why do people turn to alcohol? The reason for this is alcohol in itself tastes pretty nasty in my opinion. As in spirits like Vodka, Whiskey and other hard liquors. Do you guys mix alcohol or just drink beer etc? This is purely out of curiosity I am not looking to berate or offend anyone here. I sincerely hope that those of you who do indeed suffer from an addiction to alcohol that you overcome it!

<TEXT> Do you guys feel that MGS2 is one of the more relevant games for our society/time?. With the underlying themes of digital censorship and the control of information, I feel that this game is even more relevant now than it was back when it released.

<TEXT> So with all the cool themes I am seeing in the /androidthemes subreddit, I was curious as to how you install these themes, sorry for being a complete retard, the most complex thing I have done to my phone is flashing the firmware to Yakju to get OTA updates.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [TOMT] [film] Horror film where killer female bride turns into a monster and kills people  </TITLE>

<TEXT> Watched a horror film when I was really young, sometime in the mid 90s (the movie may have been reeleased prior) and it involved this female bride going turning into a monster and killing people. The only scene I vaguely remember was that of the bride walking along the side-walk and she comes across this kid playing a violin and then proceeds to kill him or injure him. Sorry that I cannot remember much of the film at all. It would be of great help to find the title of this film. Thanks.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So here is my pick for music that I play in EVE Online when I get the chance to play. This song just makes me feel like exploring infinitely which in turn coincides with what I love to do in EVE :D!
