<TEXT> Initially, the hour glass shape was the mob farm, but it didn't work because it was too low (monsters would spawn in the caves below, not in the farm) so I made another mob farm on top of it, the upper most part is the chamber where they spawn, with 4 8-long and 2-wide canals that lead to the hole in the middle. And yes, sorry, everything was done with vanilla minecraft.

EDIT: Monsters spawn within a range of 144x144 according to the video I watched, but they only move when you're in range (about 32 blocks). Yet if you are to close, they don't spawn, I think they spawn when you're 24 blocks away. So I made sure that the floor of the dark room on top was 30 blocks above the floor where you can kill the mobs. Because it is so high up (the collecting floor is 72+ above the ground, to prevent monsters from spawning below) and I put torches on the ceiling and the collecting floor, they are forced to spawn in the room. 

In the room, there are 4 canals leading to the hole in the middle, which are 2 blocks deep, in order to prevent the mobs to escape. At the bottom of the tunnel, i put slabs in order to kill the monster and prevent spiders from escaping. 

This is the video which helped me a lot: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liYHNsXTcBc  </TEXT>

"We do know that a supply of smallpox-infected blankets was available, since the disease had broken out at Fort Pitt some weeks previously. We also know that the following spring smallpox was reported to be raging among the Indians in the vicinity."

<TEXT> That's true, although it is suggested that  bloodtypes omit certain markers which a mosquito can detect: 
Blood-type markers are chemicals released by people of a specific blood type  so if someone with AB blood emitted a marker, it would be different than that released by B. One study found persons with Type O blood suffered more mosquito landings because of the odorant markers they emit than any other blood type, making their juices a hot commodity for blood banks, as well as Asian Tiger Mosquitoes, which carry West Nile Virus. Not only were Type Os more likely to be landed on, but the study found that for any blood type, people who secreted a chemical marker about their blood type through their skin (both blood type and secretor status are determined by genes) were bitten much more than non-secretors; 24 percent in the case of the Type Os. Other researchers estimate about 15 percent of the population, based on their genes, dont emit chemical markers of their blood type through their skin and saliva, so something else has to be calling the mosquitoes to them.
