<TEXT> We went to San Francisco for an 8th grade trip and one of the things we did were go ice skating outside in the middle of the city. Keep in mind, I can't skate period, and I remember holding on the the side railing the entire time on the ice as I slowly walked around the rink one time before deciding to get off the ice, regretting the wasted 20 dollars renting the skates. Just as I was about 5 feet away from the exit, I look to my right to see a girl who had seemingly got the hang of skating until, and I shit you not, her skates completely malfunctioned under her feet and let me tell you...there was no time inbetween this chick skating perfectly and her face planting while sliding in the wall head first. Never wanted to laugh so hard in my entire life...I'm going to hell. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most people who claim to have insomnia don't. Usually they're doing something that stimulates their brain which can be anything from the emission of blue light from your Iphone or laptop (which actually stimulates you the most of different light types which I won't get too deep into) or even having a simple source of light like a lamp or nitelight which could confuse your brain into thinking it's still day-time and prevents from certain chemicals in your brain which help get you drowsy. I have sleep problems too. Sleep at 4am, wake at 2pm depressed that I only have a couple more hours of day light to be productive. Vicious cycle. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Only problem I see with this clarification, great job on that btw, is that Blacks are not the only ones not getting their 'food'. Let's not pretend for one second that only black minorities are the only victims in society. 'All lives matter' to me means that, sure blacks are at a disadvantage to a certain extent but so are muslims (who probably have it worse in the USA), sikhs, Latinos, and any other minority that don't even have prominent leaders within the culture or the ability to come together and address problems they face in society. They all get swept under the rug which I can't stand to see. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wouldn't say I'm religious per-say, but I do believe there is a 'God' (physical being or not) in some form or fashion. Isn't it crazy that we as humans, planets, and universe exist. I mean the universe had to have spawned from something, right? (God or Big Bang) But, how did that something come into existence for it create the universe? and it just becomes a vicious cycle that is impossible to fathom. We are something from nothing...literally, which defies any and all laws of this world that I know of. Truly, mind-blasting that a relatively new-born species can even have the cognitive ability to recognize or contemplate it's own world's creation and stem away from the programmed 'Eat, Survive, Procreate' that all animals have. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would explain myself but I was traumatized after watching it and have since forgot the premise but I do remember thinking that the story was either poorly put together or non-existent. Never felt anyone was in real danger. Hell, I don't even remember who the villian was, so that should say something in itself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Red Eye" by Big KRIT gives me chills and I've never been in a tough relationship like that. It takes REAL artistry to make me feel like I've experienced what the artist has. And the way he tell the story of this situation while rhyming and staying on beat is amazing. Not to mention that the instrumental, especially the piano backbone is so powerful even on its own. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Did the same thing except I said "Attention Walmart shoppers. All items will be 90% percent off for the next 10 minutes. Thank you." And I watched the store turn from a place where civilians buy goods to a trackmeet of sorts in which people rushed through every isle half-jogging, grabbing what they could and sprinting to the cash register as the workers looked at each other in complete confusion. Some middle-aged man had watched me walk up, and me not wearing the typical walmart get-up...ya know the blue shirt with the khakis, and when I had finished my 'announcement' he looked me dead in the eyes while shaking his head and said "Some people just want to watch the world burn." And then he just walked away. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My Art I teacher told us that purple doesn't exist but he said he "didn't want to get into it" and taught us the lesson. Not only that but he'd get mad if we used the term purple, he said that it was incorrect and that the correct term was violet. I always that the two were interchangable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello, recently my Chrome is being affected by a virus of sorts that always appears when i search something on google, it brings up suggestions that says 'Ads by SuperAdRemoval' as you can see on the photo.

It doesn't appear on my extensions and on the control panel of programs so i have no idea on how to remove this virus?!

Any help would be appreciated, thanks.

<TEXT> A lost dog strays into a jungle. A lion sees this from a distance and says with caution "this guy looks edible, never seen his kind before". So the lion starts rushing towards the dog with menace. The dog notices and starts to panic but as he's about to run he sees some bones next to him and gets an idea and says loudly "mmm...that was some good lion meat!". The lion abruptly stops and says " woah! This guy seems tougher then he looks, I better leave while I can". Over by the tree top, a monkey witnessed everything. Evidently, the monkey realizes the he can benefit from this situation by telling the lion and getting something in return. So the monkey proceeds to tell the lion what really happened and the lion says angrily "get on my back, we'll get him together". So they start rushing back to the dog. The dog sees them and realized what happened and starts to panic even more. He then gets another idea and shouts "where the hell is that monkey! I told him to bring me another lion an hour ago... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Murkah is my favorite host/guest. But where I think many might get confused with my comment is that Wings brought a certain type of spontaneous entertainment and hilaritiy. And, yes most of the time we would laugh at him but that was what cause most of the best moments on the show ever. Seriously go watch some 'Funniest moments of PKA' videos on youtube 90% the funny spawned from Wings. I love Murkah but he's more intellectual and calculated with his sarcastic remarks. Murkah is my favorite host/guest of every single person whose been on PKA but no one truly can replace or replicate what wings did for the show.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not very hard at all to get into it. Check out busyworksbeats on youtube for things you really need help on. I was in a similar position to you when I was 14 and I started making beats on FL with no knowledge of chords or scales. All I really suggest is buying proper studio monitors. For hiphop production THAT IS ALL THE HARDWARE YOU NEED. Get some good VST's and demos and your set. I've been making beats for about a year and a half and [these](https://soundcloud.com/sonnywane/my-chain/s-unAqy) are the types of things I'm doing now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No man, They did him right in my opinion. Granted, I never read comic books at all so I don't know exactly the in's and out's of Kingpin's character but I get the essence of him. And I feel like they took a comic character and made him a REAL human being. Also, the reason he was a 'numbskull' was that he truly fell in love and it changed him. I think we will definitely get a more darker Kingpin in the future of the show though which would be cool to see. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Where do I begin. I hated the orange filter over the film, Tom Hardy doesn't even talk, they didn't really introduce the setting or environment for those who have never seen a mad max film before (like me), the conflict at hand was sort of confusing, they drive for about an hour in one direction only to drive back, their were probably more explosions than words spoken and dare I say that the transformer movies that people shit on had more of a story and coolness factor than this movie, they want to see the green place or whatever the fuck but you see the grass on top of the pillars in the beginning of the movie, this movie could have been over in 13 minutes had they seen the grass on the top of the pillars, OHHH and if the mass majority lived without water and power why the fuck don't they revolt, how did the world become the sahara desert, what is the world like on other continents, and lastly the story was absolutely non-existent which kind of pisses me off and I am not hard to please when it comes to movies, but this is one of the few movies that I've ever truly hated and it disgusts me that people drool over it and honestly demand more movies like it.

TL;DR: Mad Max is garbage. Don't get sucked into the hype. </TEXT>

I just watch alot of old PKA's out of nostalgia and it kinda sucks that Wings, arguably the life of the show, is gone. WE WILL NEVER SEE THE OLD CAST TOGETHER EVER, which really upsets me. Anyways, Murka and Kyle are great. I'll keep watching until those two are gone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a suggestion for the PKA crew to watch. Woody, in PKA 238, said he wanted to stream movies and I immediately thought of Black Mirror. WATCH EPISODE TWO, this is a tv show like 'The Twilight Zone' only it is a more modern, rated-r version. I would love you guys to give theories on what you think the second episode (the best episode) symbolizes because there is a lot a room for interpretation.

Edit: I think Kyle may have mentioned this show before on PKA. He may have already seen it so idk. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Im 16 y/o, I make hiphop instrumentals and whatnot, I am running out of samples and I was wanting a challenge or even just some suggestions. I'd prefer ambient, chillwave, downtempo, soul, disco, or rnb samples, although any suggestion would be great!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am currently 16 but when I was 14 I was in a similar situation. Try FL Studio's free demo. I used that for a year. Save your projects and export them all you want! You just can't re-open saved projects after closing the program :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> Simple Kick on every fourth beat, a oldschool hat, and a clap. Not my genre per-say (  I'm 16) but its just a simple drum loop over a sample. I could re-create it in like 2 minutes. Sorry, but I don't know what exactly you are asking. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not an expert, just a 16 y/o hiphop music producer, and I use samples a TON, but I think the situation varies on who you are sampling. If you can get into contact with the creator of the sample source, he/she can give you permission to use the sample for free or they might charge you/want a cut for the use of their artistry. If you're releasing this for monetary gains, usually the label would take care of sample clearance but I'm not sure if thats possibility in your situation or not. </TEXT>
