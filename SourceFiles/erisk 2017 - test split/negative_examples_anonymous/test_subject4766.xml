<TEXT> Not sure about you guys but I'm getting a bit tired of the avengers fighting a large army I'm hoping infinity war will rectify that with Thanos all I want is the aveners vs Thanos thats it.But with AOU I think I was starting to get a bit superhero fatigue because there were just so many heroes involved. 

I like how Ant-Man went back to basics. It was small up close and personal and it was a solid origin story and it was just overall a more enjoyable film for me. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Batman: Under the red hood now one of my favorite DC animated movies </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I watched this a couple of nights ago and I gotta say its now one of my favorite DC animated movies. The plot twist was pretty predictable but that didn't take away from the movie though.Some people say the joker was miscast in this but I actually enjoyed the voice actor they chose same for Batman both were really solid.

Its a great animated feature and you guys should most definitely watch it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I found this gem. 

margot robbie is ugly, a bad actress, a home wrecker in real life, and has no charisma to be harley quinn. So many women that have pulled harley quinn off at comic cons, yet hollywood butchered her in this film... Lets see if she acts like an airhead and says funny shit like the real character does... And will smith (which was/is having an affair with margot robbie in real life, since focus) will always be a comedian and suck at being a serious actor... He doesn't even look like deadshot... I guarantee they will both be each other's love interest (again) in this film, since joker is out of the suicide squad. Deadshot should not be a black man... If they made luke cage into a white man, people would cry racism. Then you have ben affleck as batman as the "good" likely protagonist that could never be as good as micheal keaton... The joker doesn't even appear to be the joker... Lets see how charismatic he will be like ledger or nicholson... Killer croc is too small... This is the worst cast i have ever seen for any comic film... And i really wanted to like this film, but the cast killed it... I'm sick and tire of you assholes responding to me when you know i'm going to delete your comment by deleting this one and pasting it again without you shit talking... Let me express myself and leave me alone!!!

<TEXT> So D23 is coming up and Disney and Marvel are rumored to show the first trailer for Civil War. This past weekend comic-con happened and lots of leaked trailers have been appearing online. 

WB intially only released the Batman V Superman trailer but tried to keep suicide squad comic-con exlusive for as long as they could but eventually caved in and released it in HD as well. 

I hope Marvel learns from this and realizes that its better to release the trailer officially rather than have people watch it in crappy cam quality since its going to leak anyway especially at d23 where the security isnt as tight as comic-con. 

Studios need to stop with this exclusitivity bullshit. Hopefully Marvel learned from this years comic-con and wont repeat the same mistake as WB.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So In case you didn't hear AMDs stock is at an all time low. AMD makes the chips inside the PS4,Xbox one and Wii U so It just doesn't affect sony but lets focus on Sony right now. If something happened to AMD what would happen to the ps4? who would manufacture the chips? would sony outsource development to someone else?

<TEXT> I feel like this needs to be said every time a new marvel movie is released. Getting below 70% doesn't mean its a bad movie by any means there are far worse movies out there and besides chances are it could increase to at least over 70% enough to get it certified fresh. Remember the embargo just got lifted so its to early to call the RT number just yet so chill out and go see the movie, enjoy it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For one the ps4 is pretty slim as it is. What I can see happening instead of a slim model coming out is they keep releasing new hardware revisions sort of like the iphone. We've already seen that with the new CUH-1200 model. With an 18% saving in power consumption, A smaller motherboard and memory modules etc.  Well probably get a "4k" compatible ps4 in the future with a bit more horse power. The only thing I can see going wrong is if they make new games only available only on the newer ps4 models. That would just piss people off.  </TEXT>

I think when Stark finds out Bucky killed his parents Stark wont be able to forgive Rogers for keeping that from him. They will put a side their differences in Civil War for the greater good but once the dust settles in Civil War stark and rogers will part ways until Thanos arrives.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-06-23 11:10:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Anyone who wanted to play the master chief collection has already bought an xbox one. 

The ending of halo 4 would probably convince quite a lot of PC players to buy halo 5 and an xbox one. As a result MCC on PC would drive more sales for halo 5 and xbox one. This is something ms could use to their marketing advantage like. "play halo 4 on PC before halo 5 on xbox one with the master chief collection on pc in 1080p/60fps" idk im not a marketing guy lol just an idea. 

in the end just put the game on steam. Give it a bit of discount for having pc gamers wait so long and watch the money flow in. Everybody wins.

How much of a role would the show being involved with marvel have influenced ABCs decision on whether or not to renew or cancel future seasons? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is there any way Sony could back out of the spider-man deal with Marvel? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-14 09:16:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> With news that sony and marvel might be arguing over who the next spider-man should be it's got me a bit worried. I've been trying to think if there's anything Sony could do to possibly back out of the deal with Marvel if Sony doesn't like working with Marvel.

One would assume that Marvel/Disney aren't that stupid and they would of had their lawyers double and triple check the contract before signing it to make sure Sony couldn't find away to back out. But I'm curious if there is? Any lawyers here familiar with things like this? Would Sony be able to make a case if they don't like working with marvel and cant decide on a spider-man and want to back out of the deal. could they? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Remember the marvel event last October? Feige said that anything that wasn't announced then was ether stll in development or just pure rumor and speculation. He was asked about Benedict Cumberbatch at the time and basically said his casting was still in negotiations and unfortunately he wasn't cast till about a month or to after the event. Feige apparently had his phone ready and waiting for the call to announce Cumberbatch at the event but these things take time. Especially when dealing with such young actors their probably nervous about signing on to such a strict contract like this.  </TEXT>

I think Ant-Man will do better mostly because of its connection to the MCU. Mean while FF has already had two bad movies under its belt and people haven't forgotten those so they may not be as willing to give this reboot a chance.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> He didn't retire.So many of you misunderstood the end of Iron Man 3. He destroyed his suits for pepper but he never stopped being Iron Man. Thats why it was called the clean slate protocol. He wanted a fresh start and to forget the past. He even said before the credits rolled  "You can take away everything from me but there's one thing you can't take away I'm Iron Man" </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. Spider-Man must not have a big role in Civil War and they are filming around his scenes until they cast someone

<TEXT> Totally agree. I have always said the consoles need to put FPS over resolution. A higher frame rate just makes the game that much more enjoyable when your not noticing stutter or clipping when moving around. It doesn't make sense to have the game running at 1080p when the hardware clearly cant handle it.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-05-29 02:57:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I think there needs to be a time jump in season 4. Have season 4 take place 1 or 2 years post season 3. That way they can get as far away from it as possible. Have Oliver and Felicity develop a proper relationship during that time off screen so we don't need to see her cry every time Oliver does something she doesn't approve of and they wont have to mention anything that happened in season 3 ether except for maybe Saras death then they can jump straight into the action in season 4. Have some devastating event that causes Oliver to come out of retirement and return to starling city and bam just like that you got season 4 the rest is up to the writers on what story they have planned hopefully its something awesome.

<TEXT> Yea I know deadline and various other sites are saying its gotten a 13 episode renewal so I was curious and checked the official facebook and twitter pages of POI and I see they haven't announced on ether of those services that the show has been renewed yet. Is it possible their still deciding on the whole 13 episode thing? since deadline was the only one mentioning it maybe they jumped the gun a bit to soon and had an unreliable source? you'd think like other shows they would want their fans to know they have been renewed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> How do you think season 9 will open and where do you think everyone will end up?

I think Leonard and Penny will get married

Raj will continue dating Emily despite being weirded out by her

Howard and Bernadette will ether kick Stuart out within the first few episodes or something will happen to Stuart that forces them to let him stay with them. 

Not to sure about Sheldon. He might try and get Amy back but the way they ended the episode it seems pretty clear the relationship is over at least for now. Really looking forward to see how the writers handle this.

<TEXT> Mean while Civil War will actually be the big kahuna that we're all waiting for and marvel decided that age of ultron along with ant-man were just a bridge to fill the gap while we wait. It was almost like a filler episode of a tv show setting up and teasing whats to come and didn't really move the plot forward aside from meeting some new characters. Maybe this was intentional or I just picked up on it due to Whedons background work on TV? It just felt like an episode of a tv show that plays before the finale you know what I mean? </TEXT>

I found the first half of ultron a bit boring and tedious to get through.I didn't start appreciating the twins till the second half of the film. It definitely shows that Whedon is running out of ideas and its probably a good thing hes not doing infinity war. id say its fair. Ill be a bit worried if it keeps dropping though.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Heres some of my ideas

Have an original avenger die. e.g stark or cap

Spider-Man swings in making his first appearance in an avengers movie. 

Have the avengers actually do some serious damage to thanos, thanos withdraws but we see a credit scene with him and his real army of villains and what ever aliens he might have at his disposal, ready to return in part 2. 

The guardians arrive to save the day. 

Got any other cool ideas?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There are too many story lines and we need to choose which ones we are focusing on and lift out the other ones, ie; could reduce father arc to just Roosevelt?
 
Could cut out plane crash and Richard destroying spiders and start on armored car  dont start with Spider-Man.let the danger/stakes to NYC build first and then have Spider-Man enter the scene heroically.
 
Tone down Paul Giamatti performance, so he seems a bit more menacing and less cartoonish.
 
If you cut Richard from the opening and the plane crash maybe you could instead do Harry coming home and seeing Norman at the top of the movie as a cold open.
 
Really love Electro  feels like you may not need the scene in his apartment, which makes him seems completely crazy and hard to relate too.
 
Like the idea that eel goes in his mouth and instead of burrowing, you see it glow within him
 
Need to set up the Power Plant earlier, visually.
 
Seems like the movie switches povs a lotwhy are we in Maxs pov during the car chase, worth looking at this playing out from Spideys pov.
 
There could be a better way to reveal that Peter is missing graduation  maybe when you cut Gwen you cut to the wide shot? 
 
Tiny note  dont think Peter would lie to Gwen about sirens --- maybe he just downplays it
 
Stan Lee Cameo  maybe need a little more emphasis on Peter here trying to get out of his costume and not be in seenset up a little more the pressure of the principal getting closer and closer to calling his name.
 
Instead of seeing the ghost of Captain Stacy, can just here the voice in Peters head and maybe flash back to the last movie?  Dont think we should add Cap Stacy back into car chase.
 
There is too much back and forth with Peter and Gwen  can we recut the Dim Sum scene so that it doesnt feel so repetitive of their break-up in the last movie  Can Peter be more honorable and definitive and less wishy-washy?
 
Why do we need a year to pass
 
Harry story feels like the main plot of the movie  Peter should look into the past b/c of Harry  maybe find some photos of them together as kidsuse obsession wall more to set up this part of his past not just what happened to parents.
 
Not sure what Peter learns at Roosevelt is entirely correct. Were distracted by the idea that Peter became Spider-Man b/c of his fathers blood --- all this special back story with his super-scientist dad fights with the idea that Peter is normal kid from Queens who becomes the greatest super-hero in the world
 
Andrews performance is all over the placea lot of crying and then a lot of mania. Hard to track him emotionally sometimes. It undermines his reaction to Gwens death b/c he gets upset and emotional a lot.
 
Dont like the idea that May tells Peter his parents were spies b/c two seconds later he finds out they are not and it again fights with the idea that hes an ordinary kid.
 
Like the idea that May finds out hes Spider-Man  finds his costume instead of just the rosemary harris wink-wink all the time.
 
Kind of like the morgue, but hate the dancing mortician  clich.
 
Are you using VFX to show how Electro is travelling from one point to another (bursts of electricity).
 
Need to underscore capture of goblinmore sirens as you linger on the clock 1;21, 1:22 am (nice touch).
 
Surveillance scene should be about following Harry not Peterno one should be following Peter.
 
Can Electro hum Itsy-Bitsy Spider before he plays it electronicallymaybe we can use this again.
 
Maybe intercut the ending montage and hearing Gwens speech with someone going into special projects and revealing more easter eggs and see that the rhino case has been broke into and the suit is missinggreat way to transition to rhino ending.
 
Dont need Aunt May in the kitchen.
 
Spider-man needs to feel more directly responsible for preventing the planes from crashing.
 
Dont show New Yorkers looting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't get me wrong the MCU has had some cool villains not great but cool. Loki was fun and entertaining to watch kinda reminds me of the joker a bit. Bucky was awesome too. But Fisk is just on anothr level entirely. Every time he was on screen I was legitmately scared for our heroes whic has never happened in the main MCU films because we know our hero will survive because hes got another movie out the following year. Now I really want Fisk to shows up in the new spider-man movie that would be amazing.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Had to google this cause I never heard that Joss was actually pissed about it but it seems like he actually is from what I read which sucks because I think Idris was just excited and accidentally let it out I don't think he purposefully did it just for attention like some articles make out he did. If he is cut from AOU because of this I'm glad Joss isn't doing Infinity War he seems like a bit of a dick imo but im sure there's more to this than we publicly know.  </TEXT>

Ill dig up a story I still cant get over even years on

At my old repair shop job, we had a 27" iMac come in that the user said the DVD Drive stopped working, and it was out of warranty\user didint buy applecare so apple would not touch it

Some poking about later we ended up pulling a shitload of toast and crumbs out of the slotloader, we even tipped it up and shook it and such a large amount of crumbs came out after the chunks of toast we physically fished out left us stupefied, we instantly assumed the user had kids and the kids did kid things with the mac, and as a result the drive was toast (heh)

we told the user and he went all red and said "well, I uhh.. thought it was hungry"

"huh?"

"Yeah! Well recently its always been a bit slow when you turn it on in the mornings, like its tired or something, and I figured that I feel like crap until Ive had breakfast in the morning, and I have my breakfast at the computer desk so I thought it just needed a bit more energy, so I fed it toast!"

<DATE> 2015-04-06 02:18:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been thinking with Amell now cast in TMNT2 It'll be interesting to see how they will find time to film arrow. I mean unless Season 4 features very little of Oliver I cant see when they would film it if they still want season 4 to premiere in the fall this year. TMNT2 will be filming for at least 5 or 6 months that's not including the possibility of reshoots ether and Casey Jones is an important character in the TMNT story so its not like they can film less to accommodate Amell filming arrow other wise the story would suffer. I'm wondering if the addition of this new spin off show that features some characters from arrow is a way for the CW to fill the gap so at least the CW will have an alternative to Arrow if Arrow does need to take a break this year. Thoughts?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Despite It looking a lot smaller compared to the other MCU films its got a great cast and I think its gonna have a lot of heart in it. I think the audience will really get behind Ant-Man once they see the movie. Sure it might not be a box office hit like Captain America or Iron Man but I think it will do well enough that marvel and the overall fan base wont be disappointed. I know a lot of you don't share this opinion and that's fine but I felt like Ant-Man needed some loving around here seen to many negative threads about it recently.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Joss Whedons role at Marvel and his likely replacement? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-24 02:10:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So when Joss signed his three year deal with marvel he basically became not only in charge of the avengers for that time but also became a sort of show runner for the MCU helping out other films like Thor 2 and Guardians of the Galaxy when they needed a hand and basically pointed the MCU in the right direction. However now his time is almost up and I'm wondering who will take his place? The Russo Brothers seem like the logical choice at this point but on the side they have the ghost busters to worry about and it would seem like its too much for even two people to worry about. if not the Russo brothers who would you choose to take Whedon's place? </TEXT>

I have no where to mount it. would it be ok if I just slid it under the hard drive bay so the fan is blowing air upwards? it would not be screwed into the mother board or anything though it would be loose under the hard drive bay because I have no where to mount it.Would this be ok? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-03-08 02:01:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It seems like Loki is the only villain marvel have seem to have gotten right in the MCU. Bucky was also a pretty decent villain in TWS so marvel do seem to be learning and hopefully they'll knock it out of the park with Ultron. But it seems like with Thor and Iron Man they struggle a lot to make engaging and interesting villains. Why is that? Are their writers just having trouble grasping the source material or are they just surrounded by yes men who have no idea wtf they're doing? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-03-06 04:11:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Think for a moment about ghosts. There are two proposed types: intelligent ghosts, and memories. Then, there are time travelers, something that seems unrelated at first thought.

Intelligent ghosts are the type you can interact with, and can interact with you. Some consider them to be dangerous, and others think them friendly.

Memories, however, are like a recording, repeating over and over. Imagine hearing a childs laugh every night at 3am. It is always the same, and always plays at the same time.

A time traveler dropping into the past for ten seconds would be able to interact for that brief moment. To an observer, the traveler would be seen appearing from nowhere, doing an action, and disappearing. Could this be considered a ghost as well? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So the last episode was called the return and we got a surprise guest apperance from Manu Bennett as slade. The episode implied that Bennet was returning as Slade but he didn't really did he? he ended up back in Prison and imo It was more of a guest apperance than a return. A return to me would of been him escaping so he could of been used later on. I just found the episode title a bit misleading.

I mean what if their investment fails to return a profit in 3-4 years time? would Sony consider selling the PlayStation brand as well? The last thing the gaming industry needs is a monopoly controlled by Microsoft. Nintendo really doesn't have any stake in the industry anymore like MS and Sony currently do. Would you guys still support PlayStation if it was purchased by another brand like Samsung? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So get this, In the newest trailer there is a shot of Jason stathams Ian Shaw blowing up a car, next shot you see Dominic looking all sad at a photograph of his family .I think Shaw kills Brian and Universal is hiding it pretty damn well. What do you think? Here's the sequence im talking about. http://imgur.com/a/s10Zi now this could be just the way the trailers cut but it seems kinda obvious now that Shaw will kill someone close to Dom whether its Brian I cant say for sure but why else have that shot with the family photo with Brian in the center? </TEXT>

<TEXT> if you compare the figure on the far left to how Paul actually looks in the scenes he did manage to get filmed you'll see he looks nothing like the figure. The figure is far to thin and the head just looks wrong. plus its awkwardly placed away from the rest of the cast. It must be one of his brothers who then had their head switched out with Paul's during post.  </TEXT>

PC recommended specs will be able to run the game on 30 or 60 frames per second? 

I think, we'll stick with 30 FPS. We're not going to stop working on performance until the very end, it's crucial matter to us, there are different PCs with different specs. Programmers insisted on avoiding tricking the players by lowering predicted specs. As I mentioned before, It can only get better. </TEXT>

Everyone seemed damn sure we would get one in phase 3 but we didn't and now it looks like we might not even get one in phase 4. It looks like the Hulk will continue to be a supporting character in the avengers films which is kind of sad that marvel seem to be wasting Marks talent by using him once every 2-3 years for avengers films. Look I get that the Hulk isn't exactly an easy character to make a movie about due to him being a sort of anti hero if you will and it can be difficult to balance between Banner and Hulk but come on marvel give Hulk some love in phase 4 please! </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-01-17 04:00:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So Im a bit confused about the time line in the upcoming x-men apocalypse film. Since everything has been reset in DOFP. Does apocalypse take place in a new universe post time line reset or is it before the reset? Im guessing its before since the original cast wont be returning because all of the x-men will be too young for the original actors . But its been confirmed for a while now that Hugh Jackman will return as Wolverine. So how does that work ? or will it be like DOFP and some of it will be in the past and future at the same time? </TEXT>

This trailer was beautifully put together, its a shame the movie didn't quite live up to the hype that came from it. Still enjoyed the final product tho. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PSNL1qE6VY

Spiderman 3

This trailer got me so damn excited for venom and it still does. Just wish they could of done better by the character. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bzqHbTD64w

Inception

As great as inception was I still think its trailers were better than the movie itself especially this one the action, music and sound design in the trailer was miles above anything that was actually featured in the movie itself.  Still a great film tho again another one that was way over hyped thanks to a great trailer.

<TEXT> that's probably the truth of it to be honest It doesn't make financial sense for rockstar to have a team as large as the console development team working on a pc version they probably have like 5-10 guys working on the pc port who have no knowledge of how the pc architecture actually works they just assume that everything will translate smoothly because of the x86 architecture used on the new consoles but now their finding out that its actually not that easy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> ok here are some of mine.  

Star Wars will flop and all of Disney's future plans for the franchise are scrapped it becomes the biggest flop of all time. 

Furious 7 will be another smash hit in the fast and furious franchise spawning 3 more sequels. set for release in 2017,2019,2021 respectively. 

Avengers age of ultron will top  avatars 2 billion dollars at the Box office. the huge success will cause marvel to change some of its phase 3 plans and bring avengers infinity war part 1 forward to 2017 and part 2 in 2018. The other films will have their dates shifted slightly but phase 3 will remain intact. 

Ant-Man will be a surprise hit. Marvel will announce a sequel but will not give a release date. Many will suspect it wont be released until phase 4. 

In February Marvel and Sony announce that Spiderman will return to marvel with a new trilogy of films, the first film will be announced for 2017 starring Andrew Garfield, Garfield will also feature in avengers infinity parts 1 and 2 with a cameo in Captain America: Civil War. As part of the deal sony will get a portion of the box office earnings.  

The Avatar sequels finally begin principal photography in Wellington, New Zealand. 

After the huge success of the final hobbit film. At comic con 2015 Warner bros announces a middle earth cinematic universe.Peter Jackson will be the creative visionary behind the universe he will be the WB version of Kevin Feige, the first film will be a trilogy of films based on the origin of the Witch King of Angmar the first film would release in 2017. 

At comic con 2015 warner bros announces that batman v superman is split into 2 films with part 1 releasing in October and part 2 in march. 

Fantastic Four is another surprise hit. making around $450 million at the box office. Fox is slightly disappointed but they still go a head with the sequel and believe they can make this new iteration of Fantastic Four into a money making franchise.  </TEXT>

Tho I still need to see other films like boyhood, raid 2 and imitation game but damn whiplash was incredible. That drum solo at the end. wow was that intense and every time J.K. Simmons came on screen my eyes were just immediately drawn to him, he has such an incredible presence its kinda scary and he just elevates everyone around him I mean Miles Teller as well that dude can act. Whiplash is easily in the top 5 movies of 2014.  </TEXT>

The guy makes fun of his brother because he got an xbox one for Christmas I mean isnt that taking it a bit too far? using it to insult someone? Its not a joke any more and especially during christmas calling someone a console peasant out side of this sub who has no idea what it means is rather insulting and vulgar. Anyone else agree? I hope the mods will at least consider it because Im sick and tired of seeing thie term used now and quite frankly its embarrassing.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Less Carrie and more Saul and Quinn In season 5? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-22 08:07:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Anyone else get the feeing that there will be less Carrie and more Quinn and Saul next season?  Carrie basically doesnt have any reason to be on the show any more. Quinn is off doing his own missions and Saul looks like hes back at the CIA. Id love it if season 5 was Quinn and Saul doing mission together. Quite frankly I think Carrie's story has run its course, she said good bye to Quinn they no their relationship will never work. Quinn made that obviously clear when he left. I'm sure Carrie will still feature next season but hopefully as more of a supporting character, I really think she needs to take the backseat for a while and let the others shine. just my 2 cents.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Has anyone noticed that James Gunn has been getting rather vocal lately about the guardians and their connection to avengers and the MCU as a whole? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-21 21:36:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So in all his interviews recently, I don't know who keeps bringing it up whether its him or his interviewers but he keeps mentioning how he doesn't want people to think of guardians of the galaxy as an infinity war prequel and how he doesn't seem to fond of the guardians crossing over with the avengers and it all makes him sound rather arrogant imo because its not his decision to make where the guardians are placed in the MCU.

Now in all fairness I can understand that he wants guardians to stand on its own but guardians is part of the MCU that's never going to happen and its inevitable they will meet the avengers one way or another with or without Gunn. 

It seems to me that perhaps Gunn doesn't like where the MCU is going and Feige's vision as a whole since he even complained recently about writing Thanos in to guardians and how much trouble it was and how it was a plot that was just serving the avengers and didnt really add anything for the guardians and he doesnt want guardians to serve the avengers which again I can understand but its not his decision to make.  

Kevin Feige has a master plan hes the quiet puppet master who is pulling the strings behind the scenes and it seems like Gunn isn't too keen on following his vision. Not sure if its just me but that's the vibe im getting he wants guardians to stand on their own just how Edgar Wright wanted Antman to be standalone but that obviously wasn't going to happen and he had to be let go. 

It looks like Gunn might be in a similar position and hes starting to get rather vocal about his opinions (Which I think is good) but I hope he sits down and seriously thinks about what hes been saying before he gets in trouble with the higher ups at Marvel and Disney. 

We all know Marvel isn't afraid to change directors. I think what it comes down to is can Gunn and Feige come to a neutral agreement on who has the most control because it sounds like Gunn wants more control than he actually has. I'm only speculating here and more than likely Gunn is just messing with us and behind the scenes hes completely on board with the avengers and guardians crossing over (I hope anyway) however If worst comes to worst they may change director again and thats the last thing I want. Thats just my opinion though.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I personally will always go with the i7 model as the extra threads for work will come in handy. If you're just playing games then an i5 will be alright but youll find a few years down the line the i5 will begin to bottle neck when compared to the highest i7 at the time because of the extra threads. In some cases there is usually only a $50 difference between an i5 and i7 which is another reason i go for an i7.

<TEXT> yes we have a special coming next year followed by S4 in 2016 but with Cumberbatch now signed on to play Doctor Strange i fear that we are only going to get less and less Sherlock despite Cumerbatch saying he wants to play him to an old man i fear his schedule just wont allow it which begs the question how much longer can the series keep going?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree and disagree. The way light sabers were used in the prequels was definitely one of the few positives in my books. That final duel between Obiwan and Anakin was incredible, it was just so beautifully choreographed it was like watching a well performed ballet. But i also agree that the duel between vader and luke in empire strikes back was amazing to. It all comes down to whether or not you prefer the prequels or original trilogy and clearly your a fan of the original trilogy and i can respect that. I seem to be one of the few fans who like both trilogies.  </TEXT>

what do you guys think of this new xbox app for windows 10? is it a steam like app or just more DRM? i noticed on the bottom left there is a store icon. How cool would it be if we could purchase and play xbox games on pc? it would be a step in the right direction on microsofts part to make a unified experience which is what they hinted at a while ago with that windows 10 announcement that showed a pc, xbox one, tablet etc all lined up against each other. What do you guys think. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seems to be a common trend these days. the first couple of months of the new year are usually the dumping ground for movies you would think would be better suited for directed to dvd releases. March has gotten better over the last couple of years with movies like the hunger games taking advantage of the less competition during that time but Jan-Feb continue to deliver nothing but crap. Any particular reason for this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> But this time have him direct it instead of Blomkamp. Surely Microsoft knows they have a good thing going here with Halo and that people actually want to see this made! the short films Blomkamp did for the halo 3 advertising campaign were amazing so if they could still get Blomkamp involved as producer along side Jackson it would be perfect. If you dont know what im talking about check this out.

<TEXT> Havent played the game since release on pc so decided to try patch 1.3 and I must say even though there are still some bugs that need to be worked out like still being able to glitch in walls and swimming in mid air lol in terms of frame rate and just in general the ability to just play the game without stuttering its a huge improvement.

<TEXT> Lets take the hobbit for example, i see nothing wrong with it. ive enjoyed it right from the start and i love what peter jackson has done with middle earth and yet people still complain about silly arguments like too much CGI or he ruined the movie by adding stuff that wasn't in the book. but its not just the hobbit where im seeing this. 

The new star wars trailer for instance everyone is complaining about something whether it be the damn light saber or the lense flare near the millennium falcon or the CG in the teaser, yes ive seen people complain about that to. UGH. what is it with people and why cant we just enjoy what we have been given am I missing something here? </TEXT>

The obvious one would be an origin of gollum movie since we only catch a glimpse of it in return of the king and hear little tid bits of it through dialog, i think gollum is interesting enough to carry his own movie. Also one issue i can see being a problem is what would be the end game for a MECU? since LOTR is essentially the end any movies would have to take place prior to LOTR. Unless they came up with their own stories on what happens after LOTR but I cant really see what working well. Any ideas? </TEXT>

<TEXT> If your a gamer then youll know 2014 has been kind of shit for gaming at least imo. So many big titles have been delayed till next year which got me wondering. Why dont we hear about movies getting delayed as much as games? I mean sure we had the amazing spiderman 3 delayed this year to 2018 and as far as i know thats the only one this year. Though to be fair i dont keep up with movie news as much as i do video game news so I may be wrong on that part but if someone could enlighten me as to why movie delays dont seem to be as common id be interested to hear the reason behind it.  </TEXT>
