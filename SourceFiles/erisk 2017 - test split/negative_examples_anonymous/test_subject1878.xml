<TEXT> Really? You don't think vaccine deniers should be dismissed? Flat earthers should be given just as much credence as rounders? Phrenologists and psychologists put on equal footing? 

Scientific debates don't care about your feelings and if you're offended. It cares about evidence. And those who refuse to examine it, and deny the reality of scientific evidence are in denial. Coddling them just devalues the meaning of "skepticism."  </TEXT>

<TEXT> And? 

Had they happened in a warmer world, they would have been even worse. The point is that climate change amplifies the impacts, and without it Sandy wouldn't have been as damaging. 

It's pretty simple logic. Just because something happened naturally in the past doesn't mean man can't influence how it happens in the present. 

There were forest fires before humans existed. Does that mean humans can't start forest fires?  </TEXT>

If I turn the temperature of my freezer up .55 degrees is my ice cream going to melt?

And if you turn it up .55F again tomorrow? And the next day? And then turn it up .65F the day after? And then .75f? 

Because this warming hasn't ended. And with the CO2 we've already released, won't end for thousands of years.

But the natural warming that would be taking us out of it takes hundreds of thousands of years to acheive the temperature changes we're experiencing in just decades. So no, it's not natural.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Uh, yeah, if you're going to accuse NOAA, NASA, et al of being so bad at science that their corrections to the record are actually not correct at all, nothing I can say will change your mind. 

The fact is in the past things were measured differently (i.e. using buckets scooped from boats vs engine intake suction, or the biggest difference was when in the day measurements were taken. Morning and afternoon temperatures are pretty different, after all, and correcting for that takes no small amount of time or effort.) 

Updating and correcting for those errors is an ongoing process. Science is iterative, not conclusive, after all.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For one thing, rising sea levels set the stage for a more damaging storm surge, as Hurricane Sandy broke records with a 13.2-foot (4 meters) storm surge in New York City's Battery Park, said Pennsylvania State University climatologist Michael Mann.

"At least 1 foot of those 13.2 feet was arguably due to sea-level rise," he said. That's because sea levels are 1 foot (30 centimeters) higher than they were a century ago, he continued.

<TEXT> ...They do it to be as accurate as possible. 

And if you stop being accurate for fear of upsetting deniers, you've failed at science for a particularly poor reason. 

The thing about deniers is nothing real scientists do will have any effect on their beliefs. That's why they're called deniers. They've concocted this whole conspiracy theory about how scientists are all evil marxists out to destroy the economy, and anything scientists do is evidence of that sinister plot.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, there was a study at somepoint that looked at the full record and found just as many downward as upward adjustments, debunking that particular denier talking point. I can't find it now, but here's the next best thing, a researcher who looked into the adjustments (with some Koch funding) and found them to be legit. Even more, without the adjustments, the record would show even MORE warming than with the corrections! http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2015/04/prof-richard-muller-not-adjusting-global-temperature-records-would-be-poor-science/

<TEXT> I'm confused as to why you think comments determine activity for subs beyond /r/askreddit and other specifically-discussion-based subs. 

9/10 of all posts get zero comments. That was my point when I directed you to /all/new. Most posts die in the new queue, it's a fact of reddit, and part of the upvote-merit system. Judging subs by that is simply ignorant of how reddit works. 

And the nerve you hit is the one concerning false claims with absolutely zero evidence.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Comments are an inherently weak metric for activity, because as this demonstrates, a massive number of comments could be generated by just two users (or one talking to themself) and would give the impression of a large amount of activity when in fact there's not. See /r/counting for a prime example of comments not meaning anything substantial. 

Subreddit growth would probably be the best measurement, since that only includes new, active users (whereas subscribers includes some number of now-inactive subscribers). 

So compare: http://redditmetrics.com/r/climateskeptics

to http://redditmetrics.com/r/climate 

Or don't, and stop with the baseless claim that subreddits you don't like are dead. Just because you don't understand and refuse to acknowledge how reddit works doesn't mean you're right to declare subs dead.

<TEXT> Nice spin, but as usual factually inaccurate (suggesting that *this* is what sets precedent for EPA to do cost-benefit, lol!)

I'll keep it nice and simple:

EPA was planning on taking costs into account at the next stage of the MATS development. SCOTUS says "Go ahead and do it now."

So this simply rearranges the timeline, doesn't invalidate the MATS and certainly doesn't change anything about CPP.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Did you mean CPP? 

Because like I just said, this [kicks out one of the legs of the CPP plaintiff's arguments](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-24/obama-may-win-by-losing-in-quirk-of-supreme-court-epa-review), that since coal plants are regulated under MATS they can't be under CPP. So unless you're seeing some  way for a new lawsuit because of the MATS ruling (which would be novel because IIRC the CPP already did the cost accounting that MATS didn't yet ) then I think you're mistaken.

If you did mean MATS, then it's still not accurate since this ruling just kicked the suit back down to the DC court to make the EPA consider costs now instead of later when designing the enforcement. Doesn't throw out the MATS rule, just says the EPA has to take costs into account. DC court may throw out the rule, but since it upheld the rule last time it's not likely to toss it now, but instead will probably just tell the EPA to go count costs, thereby just delaying enforcement.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's my paraphrasing of paragraphs 4-6:

"Yet, there is a marked lack of publicly available information and analysis which would help New Zealanders decide on the best course of action."

The government had hurried its consultation process on its a negotiating position in the United Nations Paris meeting on climate change in December last year, to a period less than four weeks.

The NZAS was concerned about the lack of publicly available information, as well as the minimal involvement of key New Zealand state-owned research institutes and universities. </TEXT>

Other academic institutions, including state-owned research centers and universities weren't consulted and weren't didn't have access to the data. 

So by shutting them out of the process, they were denied the ability to provide their scientific input, i.e. were gagged.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> ...why the exclusion of Title+Quote? Seems like if title is allowed, and quote is allowed, then the combination should be allowed. I feel like quotes without the context of a title aren't going to make sense, and submissions with the flashiest quote that may or may not represent the full article (as a title would) are going to proliferate. 

Which means that the mods will now have to subjectively decide if a quote is an accurate representation because the title is no longer there to provide an overview of the whole piece.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whereas when you look at any group disputing climate change, 100% of the funding is from fossil fuel groups or dark money, aka nonprofit money laundering for the Kochs. And good luck finding their funding info, because they sure don't make it as easy to find as AAAS. 

(And a note, that funding was only for the "What We Know" project, not the AAAS as a whole.)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well if you want to take that path, then it should be pretty obvious-who is more likely to be right, and who is more likely to be bought off, the group that consists of 97% of the scientists in the field, who get public grants for research (meaning they don't get to pocket the money) and who are delivering a message no one wants to hear in peer-reviewed journals for the past 100 years, or the group of just 3%, who get private funding from fossil fuel companies (meaning they do get to pocket money) and are delivering a message that fossil fuel companies want to put out, and whose work rarely appears in peer-reviewed journals and when they do are quickly and thoroughly debunked. 

So you can either believe that nearly every single one the world's climate scientists at every legitimate institution and every university have been bought, or that a small handful of scientists with otherwise dead-end careers have been bought.

That said, I'd recommend you take a look at the science. There are a number of fairly straightforward explainers from what should be credible sources- The A[merican Association for the Advancement of Science](http://whatweknow.aaas.org/), the group that puts out the #1 peer-reviewed journal, Science and is one of the oldest and most prestigious academic institutions ever is a good place to start. Then there's the [National Climate Assessment](http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/), which uses information and scientists from the various government scientific agencies, and was started by Bush to explain the state of climate science.  Then [there's the IPCC](http://ipcc.ch/), which is the international look at the state of the science, and has been approved by delegates from every country (including petrostates like Saudi Arabia. So even Saudis agree that what's there is the truth.)  </TEXT>

I bet deniers would also get questions about the rate of warming wrong. I also bet they'd get questions about how much warming is caused by man wrong too! 

But thanks for confirming that TP'ers/deniers come from a position of factual inaccuracy.  </TEXT>

And maybe some Canadian Provinces? And other countries too as they look for ways to live up to emissions reductions pledges as part of the UNFCC negotiations?

<TEXT> I get what you're saying, I'm not disagreeing. I'm telling you that you're expecting the media to operate as though they're publishing PhD's, and expecting the public to understand things like publishing PhD's. It's just unrealistic. 

The focus on the term is just a heuristic. No, it's not technically 100% accurate. No, it's not the key issue. *It's just a symbol that people can understand.* 

Having the slightest idea what you're reporting on

I hate to tell you, only the most experienced and educated reporters have any clue what they report on. If you'd like to change that, convince more PhDs to stop writing peer-reviewed studies and start writing for the public.

Something that most PhDs don't know and always have a hard time dealing with: mainstream media is written for an 8th grade reading level. 

Let that sink in. 8th grade. 

That's the standard you can to hold them to.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> the use of the term 'deliverable' in no way implies such a relationship. 

I mean...it kind of does though, if the other option is that there's no relationship at all. It isn't inherently bad, but it does mean that the study was done on the company's behalf. Which means he's not independent, and he should declare the funding. 

What is the purpose of paying attention to their coverage, when they admittedly have absolutely no idea what they are doing?

Then don't. If you demand perfection you'll always be disappointed, and you can go ahead and stop doing anything outside the ivory tower.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess I should have added that he claims to be independent, but if it's a study for a company in exchange for funding, then it's not really independent. Right? 

I just think you're holding the public media to a higher standard than they're ever going to meet. You can't expect the public/media to understand the details of publishing. Of course it'd be nice if they followed science as closely as pop culture, but that's just unrealistic, you know?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, the stages are a nice way of classifying things, but people don't necessarily progress from one to the next. Which is why I'm a big fan of John Cook's [Quantum theory of climate denial](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-cook/the-quantum-theory-of-climate-denial_b_5229539.html). 

What kind of facts you're presenting to a denier determines what stage of denial their response will be, and they'll collapse from one stage to another like quantum energy stuff... </TEXT>

<TEXT> From a [comment 10 minutes ago, in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/35l2mw/whats_causing_texas_earthquakes_fracking_most/cr5ro87?context=3): 

When they stop fracking the quakes stop, when they start fracking the quakes start again. It can't be a coincidence. The other day we had a 4.0 the other day and we have had some gas mains explode because of this and people lost their lives and their homes. Our gas mains are old and need replaced before they can handle all the movement.

<TEXT> Oh and [about the 2/3rds number](http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-06-26/climate-change-and-the-two-thirds-imperative): 

The two-thirds imperative was enunciated in the 2012 edition of the IEAs annual World Energy Outlook: No more than one-third of proven reserves of fossil fuels can be consumed prior to 2050 if the world is to achieve the 2 degrees C goal </TEXT>

<TEXT> According to the[ Congressional Research Service](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/post/just-how-dirty-are-canadas-oil-sands-anyway/2012/05/23/gJQAGdlkkU_blog.html): 

oil from tar sands produces 14 to 20 percent more carbon emissions than other oil the U.S. imports.

So no, this is not a clean fuel alternative. But please, don't let facts keep you from rationalizing and grasping for straws... </TEXT>

<TEXT> The point is that the science is telling us we need to leave 2/3rds of known fossil fuel reserves in the ground. 

How, then, does it make sense to build NEW fossil fuel infrastructure? 

It's like your doctor telling you to go on a diet, and instead you sign up for a rewards card at Cinnabon. 

And I don't think anyone (well informed) thinks stopping KXL will have a major effect on the industry. But it's like the divestment campaign, it's meant to revoke their social license to operate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, I just deleted an irrelevant portion of the quote for length. Not that it really matters since the post isn't going anywhere, but is that not ok? 

I left a [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3521fl/stanfords_jon_krosnick_on_climate_change_most/cr06cji) with the full quote, which as you can see doesn't differ in substance from my title...

 80% of Americans  I never see 80% of Americans agreeing on anything when it comes to other issues, so this is very unusual  believe the federal government should limit greenhouse gas emissions by businesses and in particular by public utilities.

I know rules are rules, but it seems like editing out a side thought shouldn't be worth removing the post... </TEXT>
