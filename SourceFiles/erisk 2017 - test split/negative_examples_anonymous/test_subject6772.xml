<TEXT> They must have gay marriage there - because weather is only caused by god and he uses it to punish people for gay sins. Yep, after the scotus decision, and unlike tx/etc, PR amended their laws to reflect the change.

See, all this is so simple when you adopt a conservative view of existence. Allowing gays to serve or marry = droughts, hurricanes, etc. Science is so much easier when you become a super intelligent conservative.

Techs who have worked in the enterprise for years have seen first hand the problems caused by updates (One company I worked for we had to skip an NT update on our core software our reps used wouldn't be able to run on the server).

Give people the option to skip updates - I predict this will lead to headaches, will fail, and as usual microsoft will have to admit they didn't listen to actual users and remove this 'feature'. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Now, think about this:
1. We were told Obama would take all our guns. Not try to, or think about it, but that he could and would. Gun sales soared.

2. The right claimed Obama was banning all wood burning stoves. 

3. The right said Obama was banning chores for kids (I still chuckle over that one).

Go back to 2008/2012 and look at all the fear mongering from the conservatives. It was like code red alert end of America we are all gonna die (probably from ebola or isis flying those libyan jets the right swore they stole and would use to crash into buildings here).

It is all the right ever has. Scare people. Why do you think churches talk about the end of the world and hell? Scare people into obedience. It is how the conservative mind works. It doesn't require intelligence or thinking.

<TEXT> Naw, trump just knows weak minded people will follow a leader who tells them they are in danger and so is the country and that by voting for him you are saving America, and are therefore a sort of hero.

It's been this way forever. Always some evil force coming to kill us all, elect me and I will save America. It's like the education system. Politicians have said since the 80's it was broken and they would fix if you elect them. 35 years later and they are still saying it is broken and they will fix it.

It's all BS. Tell people there is a problem, tell them you are the solution. War, terror (didn't we just have a few wars over this), immigrants flooding in by the zillions to rape, murder and steal your jobs (that don't exist, remember, because Obama....so not sure where all the  immigrants are working).

People fall for it all the time - while all the real issues that are harming us are internal and swept under the rug. The people in power use fear like religion, to keep the gullible voting for em. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Trump relies on people who don't think but react with emotion. 

He is one of those people who believes that if he just tells you that America is doomed and he can save it that people will vote for him. He knows how to play people.

2 Wars this century and drone strikes across the globe were supposed to make us more safe - now the right wants to go back to war in Iraq and attack Iran. You know, to keep us safe.....

Trump adds in immigration to the mix to add to the fear. More money to spend on borders and troops there, spend more on wars and weapons. All the while people starving and not able to get medical care....well, screw em. Just cause the real things hurting Americans aren't exciting and don't make 'heroes' in epic over powered battles. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Where are our conservative friends now? I mean - we are giving Israel welfare money basically. Tell em pull themselves up by their bootstraps and work harder.

Oh yeah, I forgot - Jesus told them "Screw the poor, but if you don't support Israel I will curse you" or something like that. So they help Israel because they believe it is a sin not to, and don't help the poor because they believe it is a sin to do so.

I never will understand those people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, let's discuss.

I made 80k/yr and my engineers made 65k/yr, and I have a GED. 

I managed data centers for one of the 2 biggest banks in the US. I did it well, and my engineers did a good job as well. We worked for a company that is still making good profits and was back when I worked for them. 

But a new VP of operations came in and decided that if he saved money he would look good. So he undid what had been done (moving from outsourcing to IBM to insourcing) and fired all the engineers in data centers - and replaced them with people making 12.50/hr. 

These guys had mortgages, car payments, pension plans, etc - but hey, let's save a few bucks more. Oh, and now - about 6 years later - there is a new vp in place who is struggling with issues this has caused (replacing good techs with cheap labor).

Now...you may be asking yourself, what does this have to do with minimum wage and such?

Good question. Thing is, too many companies are run by people with short term ideals. Yes - you can train someone else to flip those burgers. But that takes time and resources away from people who have experience at those jobs.  

Companies get a few people in power who want to please a short term financial goal and will ditch well trained people already working there because they have attitudes like yours. It's all a numbers game to them - cut some costs real quick, get a bonus, and screw the long term because I have a business degree and can get another job.

Long story short, these little people are the ones out there doing the day to day work that needs to be done that no one else will do, is it too much to ask that they get a piece of the benefits of that labor? Again - why the hell do we praise the people not doing the work when they get the rewards from the company's profits but vilify others when they want to get back what they have invested (their labor/time).

Naw, the right just likes to whine when the people who do the actual working get a little more. They wish we could pay wages like in Vietnam or have child slave labor. Sorry, society progresses over time away from such things. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And then there is this:

 Charles Lieberman, chief investment officer at Advisors Capital Management, with assets of $1.2 billion, notes that Chipotles same-store sales have been rising by more than 10% annually, **but about six percentage points of the growth comes from price hikes that could cost the chain customers.** Theyre opening 200 new units a year, says Lieberman. Its very hard to find that many good locations and sustain such a rapid expansion without cannibalizing existing units or accepting less-attractive locations.

So they have been raising prices all over the place, pumping money into new stores, and keeping the investors happy by kicking up prices - but yeah, no one complained about that did they?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Meh. Their cost of renting there is double elsewhere so their costs will be impacted more, so it's more of a one off scenario for them.

Their stock has been going down, competition is getting more funds. But here is the funny thing....

When companies like this, and others, raise their prices, or in case of groceries put less ounces in a box and charge the same, etc so that investors can get more money I don't hear the right complaining at all.

Funny how they only whine like babies when the people doing the actual work get more of the pie. Watch - this story will be all over the con blogosphere, and yet not a peep from them when other prices go up because the wealthy wanted more profit from people.

Funny how that works. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am sure we could agree on a lot.

As far as the teach the man to fish meme - that works well until you realize that a few big fishing companies own the boats and have nets while all the person has is a single line and there are less and less fish to catch.

When the lake is controlled by the few then the many won't have enough fish to catch.

Add to that how conservatives claim on one hand that there aren't any jobs because obama sucks - then they turn around and claim that if they extend unemployment benefits it will make people lazy and they won't look for work it gets fun. Either there aren't enough jobs or there are.

Then they claim all the new jobs are just crappy low paying part time jobs. Well, people in those jobs could certainly use aid.

<TEXT> Oh I see the virtues. But then you don't need religion to have virtues.

The people over there not condemning this (and you won't hear about them in the news if some did) are complicit IMHO.

Which leads to - is the same true here?

You have mostly christians, who tend to be conservative, fighting against helping people here, wars, etc (as mentioned) - and instead of churches saying it's crap and wrong, they are joining in on the conservative messages.

As far as the attack in the church - think about it. It wasn't a cop who did it. When cops do things they get away with it. An individual is not a government employee - and he was arrested and charged, not given paid time off. So yeah. A difference. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I can. I didn't, but I can.

When you have a group of people who deny climate change cause 'jeebus' i see them as loony.

When you have people who will fight against health care for people, food for the starving, and promote corporate greed as next to godliness I say they are loony and hurting many people.

These same christians were for a senseless war and the killing of over 100k people in said war. 

Oh...I guess it is different when you kill people from afar, or don't see the person suffering in illness or hunger.

But when you use your religion to accomplish those things to please your god (out of fear he will kill us all, like with gay marriage/hurricanes/etc) you are as damned loony as these people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He knows the dog whistles. Blame immigrants. Blame blacks. Blame everyone who is different than your standard white person. 

It's always been that way with conservatives. They blamed the irish immigrants and demonized them. The Jews as well. On and on it goes because they always need someone to scare people into voting for them so they can be saved. 

They all want to be the Jesus and save people - except when it comes to health care and hunger, you know - the things people are actually needing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No one seems to whine when investors want more return and prices go up, productivity up, wages down, quality down, etc.

But god forbid the people who do the actual work and aren't sitting on a beach sipping coronas wants a little more money for their labor. 

I have watched as products in stores shrank and prices went up, as fast food prices have went up over the decades but wages didn't match. Seen companies outsource American jobs to save money but kept prices the same or higher.

Funny how the right only complains when the hard working people want more. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not about parties. Conservatives, through history, have been pro-slavery (as they are now and ship jobs to places that have slave labor), anti-gay, wanted to keep women down, and are pro-religion running countries and making laws.

It has nothing to do with party and never has. Currently the cons are mostly in the republican party, before that isn't relevant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because there are less bigots in politics here than websites like The Blaze, Free Republic, and Deadbart.

Conservatives are against gays serving their country, getting married, helping the sick, aiding the poor, and feeding the hungry - all because they believe their god will get all mad if they do and America will be punished.

Now, when it comes to spending money on wars, weapons, Israel they will gladly spend our money. 

I am guessing many folks in politics lived through the bush years an remember the tax cuts for the rich, republicans pushing for spending more and more on wars (off the books to some extent), bailing out corporations and giving them a tax holiday, etc and so on and saw how that played out.

I was, up until 2003 one of those people who voted for republicans was pretty conservative. I will never, in my lifetime, vote for another republican. They have moved so far to the right it shocks me - they would run reagan out of town for being too liberal.

Don't ever trust a conservative - money comes first for them, then using their god for laws (except when it comes to shrimp eating, working on the sabbath, etc...then suddenly they laugh at their own bible and slam it shut. But lordy, when it comes to gays and the poor they will find em some verses to use). </TEXT>

<TEXT> You fail right off with the education thing. The system wasn't broken - folks told others it was broken so that they could 'solve' the issue (by using vouchers/charter schools to funnel money from public to private hands).

That is what I am talking about - fear, etc. Tell someone there is a problem and then offer them a solution. And people buy it all the time. 

I am 49 years old. As long as I can remember people have said the economy was bad, education system was broken, Iran was getting a nuke, someone was going to kill us all, and jesus would be back any day now.

You would think after 49 years those problems would have been solved. But just wait, this election, you will hear all those problems still exist. And they always will because it gets people to vote for others to 'save' them from said problems. </TEXT>

And hey, if you want religion to rule your life and you want to live by it - fine. Go for it. Just don't involve everyone else.

Guess what? Those isis folks believe they have the word of god as well and want people to follow it - why aren't you jumping up and obeying their god? Maybe for the same reason I am not wanting to obey your god and his rules. And I don't want folks of either faith making laws here based on their beliefs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Did such questions come up after interracial marriage was allowed?

Anyway, christians would say that since it was in the bible it must have been god's will. Heck, there was a lot of incest, polygamy,  and lying in the bible by the jews in the OT - Adam and Eve had kids, and since they were the only two people ever made there had to be some weird stuff going on there.

Noah and his family? I mean, really, just read Genesis for starters - the right does what they do because of their bible, it's why they so protested gay marriage (but they are ok with dumb wars, letting the sick die, not feeding the hungry or helping those in need...yeah, I don't understand the right either).

So my view is a societal one. Do what you will just don't harm others. Consenting adults want to shack up, not my business.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> LOL. Yeah, right. Ok.

You should crack open a history book something and look at things. I am guessing you might find that some people couldn't get a divorce because they coded into law that men had the power. Same men who were sleeping around on their women. 

Kings, barons, leaders, etc - all through history they "held marriage together" by force of law and keeping women down so they had no choice but to stay and obey.

It really pisses off the right that women got more rights and didn't have to be virtual slaves. 

I get why the right is mad - they don't have the power to control lives of others like they desire.

Your religion is showing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because the right knows how to use fear to control their own.

It is always some new enemy they must defeat. They scare people into believing they are the solution. From muslims to gays to people on welfare, etc people on the right are always afraid (and part of that fear is tied to their 'god' and how he might kill us all).

Education: The peddled fear for years on it. Said it was failing, America was failing, and the best way to solve the problem was to turn things over to private companies (charter schools, etc).

Terrorism: We just need these wars, patriot act, etc and we can stop the terrorists from killing us all. So let's grow government, remove rights, and increase spending. But still....they say we are under more threat today than ever before. Sell fear, sell a solution.

Climate change: OOOPS since this isn't local to America and scientists all over the world are talking about it isn't real. But what is real is those evil scientists want to take your hard earned money. So they sell fear of science to people and propose a solution - ignore it and spend money on weapons instead.

Health Care: This will just cost us money and save lives of Americans. Money is good. We should tell people instead the only thing they have to fear is terrorism/isis/iran and take their money to stop them instead. Who cares if you die because you can't get needed care? Not conservative Christians....

People who vote for republicans do so because they cannot think for themselves and are always afraid that some god is gonna hurt us all. Republicans claim they can 'save us all' from our sins. Why do you think fundamentalist christians, racists, etc, vote for that party? </TEXT>

Wanna know who has hurt marriage? Fundies with their 'wives need to submit' and all that BS around such sexism. 

And speaking of monogamous - are you saying people having been diddling others for 6000 years (age of earth according to RW scientists)?

No, marriage was destroyed alright, by the right wing, long ago. You treat women like property, blacks and indians the same, and you cower behind a bible and claims that this is how your god wants it and if we don't conform he will kill us all.

You lost, you will always lose to progress. Get used to it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I saw lots of righties falling for this one.

Just like the ole 'Obama is gonna ban wood burning stoves/fireplaces' and the old 'Obama banned the don't tread on me symbol the army was using' and so on.

All lies, but the right never checks. They sure are skeptical of climate change issues though. Funny how their mind works. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know that about (I listen to 700wlw most the day, they talked about it a lot).

Problem is, the cops are our employees and answer to the people. We can't control what civilians do but those that we pay and empower we can exert control on.

We give cops a lot of power. They answer to us. And as their employer I like to keep up on what they are doing (especially since I am a former cop from the 80's and know just how iffy they can be at times). </TEXT>

 WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional officials say the House will attempt as early as Thursday to revive trade legislation sought by President Barack Obama and blocked last week in a revolt by union-backed Democrats.

The officials say the vote would come on a stand-alone measure that would allow Congress to approve or reject future global trade deals, but not change them.

The Obama administration is seeking the authority as it works to wrap up a deal with 11 Pacific Rim nations.

A provision to renew a program of assistance for workers who lose their jobs because of imports would become part of a separate bill. </TEXT>

<TEXT> How did we get by all these years with voting with no pic ID? 

I can't recall ever having to show ID when I voted and I am 49. You're registered, you see your name on the list, sign your name, vote. What do people think is going to happen next? I am going to drive to another polling place, wait in line again, find someone Else's name and forge it?

We have laws against that already. It has been shown to be a rare issue. But now, suddenly, people are freaking out about it and think that we are all crazy law breaking vote fraud loving citizens.

They have in their mind that voter fraud like this is all over the place because people are talking about it. Create an issue that doesn't exist, talk about it a lot, create solution. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What's it say about photo id's in the constitution? I mean, I usually hear the right say things like that (re: welfare/etc) when they don't like something.

America has become the land of mistrust. We believe everyone might be a terrorist, so not water bottles on planes, security high at every sporting event (where women can't carry their purses, etc), we have a view of each other that we are all gonna commit vote fraud (hey, there is already a law against that, right?).

How long have we even had photo id's in the US and can't people make fake ones like they do now for bars? The solution is in search of a real problem.

It's high time we got back to seeing each other as fellow Americans and not all criminals laying in wait. But the right loves fear (which is why they are pushing to invade Iran now, etc) and always pushing for less freedoms in the name of 'security'. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lowering taxes on the rich will help the economy.

Iraq has WMD, will only cost 60 billion for a short war. 

I'll shrink the government. Reduce the deficit.

And what happened? Stocks lower than when he took office, no wmd's, over a trillion for the war, recession, housing market collapse, banking/etc near disaster.

Need I say more? And all you got is that we didn't go to war and some minor issues not unlike those we had when we started social security - and it is still better than the no plan the cons had.

Obama isn't perfect by any means, but I'll take Obama over anyone the RW has had to offer or bush. That dude was an embarrassment and a failure of epic proportions. And where are we now? Not spending a trillion on the wars, economy has recovered, stock market higher than ever before.

The right just likes to whine. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  In Mr. Kerrys case, the senators want to know why he hasnt done more to put pressure on other countries to take back their immigrants when the U.S. wants to deport them. Under that 2001 Supreme Court ruling, known as the Zadvydas case, if other countries wont accept their citizens, the U.S cannot usually detain them for longer than six months. Every year, thousands of immigrants are put back on the streets because of Zadvydas.
 
 Republicans have long pressured the State Department  under both President George W. Bush and now under President Obama  to use diplomatic tools such as denying visas to top officials try to force other countries to take their citizens back.

So....explain how this is the fault of Obama? Congress has to change the rules (and they have tried, but republicans stopped one of their own's bills on just this - and I don't blame them, it was a bad bill by rep King). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love how hillary trolls conservatives :) They watch every little thing she does, write about it, comment on it, post about it.

She owns em. If they had done that with bush we probably wouldn't have had 9/11, wars, recession, stock market down (first time a ever it was lower than when a prez went into office), housing crash, banking implosion, etc.

Instead, conservatives waved their flags, thumped their bibles, and saluted their boss.

But then...no one ever accused them of being smart or consistent. </TEXT>

In the end, it's still on him and she can just say she was voting to allow the president to act in the event he needed to.

All in all - bush owns it, no one else. </TEXT>

I am also noticing firefox crashing about once a day now. Not to mention the god awful memory leaks.

The reason I use it over chrome: photobucket plugin and how turns most all headlines in caps to proper case (saves a lot of time). If chrome did that on the fly I would use it more.

<TEXT> *What's the problem?*   
  I closed firefox today and restarted (as I have had to do several times now) and lost all my shortcuts. This is the second time I have lost them but not the second time I have had to restart firefox for an issue. This doesn't happen when firefox crashes. Just when I quit/force quit.

*What other browser extensions are installed?*  
  Adblocker and ghostery.

*Did you read the known issues and search /r/RESissues?*  
  Yes. I found an issue from a year ago which related to a file on windows. I am on a mac, have most updated version of this software, and am not sure it applies here.

I also get the tips again popping up, so yes, I am sure some file somewhere is being toasted with my settings. Do I need to write a script to back it up several times a day as different names or will a future version do this?

<TEXT> Do you know who you are voting for? We could compare records...raygun, bush, clinton, bush, kerry, obama (I don't vote straight party ticket ever).

You know, if the right had huntsman running I would vote for him, and would have in 2012 if the idiots hadn't picked romney.

I don't worship a party so I don't have to kiss their ass and can point out how the two are alike. Both sides hate that. </TEXT>

Her: "Uh. Well, yes. I really can't argue with that."

Me: "Ya know, since we hang out a lot and you have nothing better to do and neither do I, why don't we get married?"

Her: "Well...OK. We might as well. When do you want to do it?"

Me: "You pick, I'm easy."

Her: "How about in May?"

Me: "Sounds good to me."

We were married 10 years, had 3 kids, and she died 10 years ago from a serious of birth defects she was born with. She did reject my idea of having chicken nuggets at the reception...can't win em all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's how it works with some conservatives:

 In addition to floating the new bike tax, the budget currently under consideration would repeal the states Complete Streets law. The policy, which mandates that all new road construction and repairs take cyclists and pedestrians into consideration, makes up only about $190,000, or six-one-thousandths of one percent of the total transportation budget

Now he will cut and cut and cut to the point it hurts even more. So when a dem runs part of their platform, to bring things back to sanity, is to spend. Then cons will point and say 'look, tax and spend liberals!' 

All the while, these same cons, are for spending more on weapons and wars (which they don't always put on the books....) Which, oddly enough, you never heard them discuss raising taxes to pay for (can you imagine the response by the right if cons has asked for a tax increase to pay for the wars? Suddenly they would all be like 'naw, we're safe enough').

So, what happens (again) is they increase spending for wars/weapons, cut the budget for things we really want and need, and then claim there is no money to pay for those things. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah the rich. They work so much harder than others. You can work 60 hours a week in one job, 20 in another, and 10 on sunday and you are still being a lazy worthless bum. Hard work means money (just ask any conservative). These people are far superior to us because they busted their asses and still are 1000 hours a week.

So sure, we should listen to their ideals. They are intellectually superior and much harder workers. What have you done for America? How many factories have you closed and how many slave laborer children have you been able to put to work in the world?

Like moses they have the led the money from it's bondage in our country to freedom and tax havens elsewhere. They have climbed the mountain of the golden calf and brought down to us the tablets, phones, and shoes from the right hand of the children of Vietnam.

Verily I say unto you, the great wealth wielders of this country have shown us the way to the promised land which flows with golden showers from above, you will come to it from shit creek, upon which you will need no paddle. 

And there, at border to this land of slave labor for all, at the land where your money where no longer burden your pockets but instead will be lifted up to become the burden of the rich....there you will the rulers they have chosen to allow you to choose from.

Go now, and spread the good news.... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here is their basic ideal (and why it is a sham):

We can all own our own businesses and with hard work can be rich.

If everyone owned a business, who would work for them?? We need workers.

The people in this country who get the most work the least. If we all worked 60 hours a week we all still wouldn't be making the same amount of money. So it isn't about "Hard Work". It never has been.

Those who do the actual work, the workers, at times ask for the same things investors do - a return on their 'investment'. But the right calls workers greedy when they do and whine about how prices could go up.

Investors want the same thing and prices go up? The right cheers that on as capitalism. </TEXT>

If we had a 60 million dollars for our sport we would have food, hookers, and booze, for everyone who came to see our games (and we would pick em up in limos to get them there).

Pretty sure we still wouldn't get anyone to come see the games (we asked for cheer leaders, but that never happened - we even said they could just sign the cheers and the school still didn't care). </TEXT>

But I suppose we should keep that in mind when creating budgets (unless the treaty is with Indians, we generally don't honor those ones and are still screwing them over like McCain recently did).

It would be interesting to know exactly what all obligations we have and under what conditions. I am sure such things have an impact, somewhere along the line, on legislation, planning, funding, etc.

One of the core ideals is that we have a collective interest in the security of the country. And foreign powers aren't the only thing which is a threat to the nation.

<TEXT> I think things should be a case by case basis at times.

Pot - is something an individual does that affects themselves. And while some can argue it has broader consequences that is over broad and not consistent.

Fracking - a broader issue that can affect many people (like pollution) on a broad scale. I would be against a federal ban but for federal regulations on the safety/environmental impact side of things.


It is, in some ways, pretty simple. What impact does X have on 'we the people'. If it impacts just the people doing it, meh, okay, have fun. As the scope of the action increases so should scrutiny and regulations to minimize negative impacts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From the article:

 A few maverick Republicans even argue that the cable network has become so powerful that it's become a problem for the party, not an advantage. Bruce Bartlett, a former aide to President Reagan, wrote recently that Fox allows conservatives to engage in self-brainwashing and may have contributed to Mitt Romney's 2012 defeat by making Republicans complacent about the victory they expected.

"Self Brainwashing", I think, is quite fitting for that crowd. </TEXT>

How many laws do Americans break a day? From speeding to pirated movies/music, to selling VHS tapes you have of old shows at a garage sale you didn't get a permit for and didn't put down on your taxes to....well, just about everything.

I am guessing that almost every US citizen has broken the law more than once. We only take notice of those the government chooses to prosecute. And then we make their life hell - from making it hard to get a job, loans, etc.

If you want to break the law - just call yourself a corporation. At least then the most you usually get is a fine which is less than the money you made from your crimes. </TEXT>

"Foundation **took**" - no, some groups/people donated.

I can see the super smart conservatives now "Why, a smart charity like the ones I donate to, would refuse all money coming in to it in case someone, somewhere, associated with that money has problems later!"

Those same 'smart' folks rush to donate money to cops who shoot unarmed people and businesses that brag about discriminating.

Yeah, I think I can give the clintons a pass on this. When the right practices what they preach then maybe I will start to take em serious. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Optimism about Libya reached its apogee in July 2012, when democratic elections brought to power a moderate, secular coalition governmenta stark change from Qaddafis four decades of dictatorship. But the country quickly slid downhill. Its first elected prime minister, Mustafa Abu Shagour, lasted less than one month in office. His quick ouster foreshadowed the trouble to come: as of this writing, Libya has had seven prime ministers in less than four years. Islamists came to dominate the first postwar parliament, the General National Congress. Meanwhile, the new government failed to disarm dozens of militias....

Sooo.... What we have is a country with democratic elections, they elected people, and it didn't work out.

Just wait - if we get a conservative in power they will call up Libya and say:

**Hi, I'm a conservative from the American Government, and we're here to help**

<TEXT> I lived there off and on since 1996 (not there now), and yeah - I remember it coming up here and there. It always seemed so regressive.

If a majority of vehicles used no gas I could see replacing the gas tax for roads with something like this (but one would also note that most likely cars would weigh less and do less damage).

It all reminds me of a story about a town in Canada. They were using a lot of electric and generating more was going to be a problem. Might have to raise rates to get an expensive new generator and get online, etc. So they pushed people hard to conserve energy, buy more energy efficient appliances, etc. 

They did. So much so that not only did they reduce electric usage by a ton but revenue fell. Which meant less money to maintain the grid/production. So....they raised prices. 

There is a stable point where a system pays for itself. Prices go up to cover the cost of maint. and such, but oddly, it seems wages never seem to match. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let me try to give a broad view on this. I went to school back in the 1970's here (elementary school). We had Christmas plays, songs, decorations, etc in my school. We also had one Jewish kid in my class and learned about Hanukkah and had some decorations for that up.

As kids, it was what we knew in real life and this was just an extension of that. I wasn't in a diverse area at the time (religiously/racially). 

The problem comes in, imho, in that such things can be exclusive and also opens a door to other things. The religious right in this country hates anything that isn't Christian centered. So if schools celebrated holidays of say, Muslims, they would prattle on about terrorism, isis, indoctrination, etc and so on. Not to mention if some students were atheist and don't celebrate any of those holidays in a religious manner.

As done here, it excludes people who aren't Christian. What has been happening is that other groups (satanic temple, muslims, etc) have leveraged the rules to get in on the 'action' and now Christians are starting to feel what others felt all along. They don't want their kids exposed to religious ideals outside of the ones they choose at home.

Personally I think it can be educational to be more diverse in schools - the issue in some cases though is that the leaders of the school are participating with a captive audience. If you have your morning announcements filled with bible verses/prayer (as I experienced) you have people in power subjugating kids to their ideals/beliefs. A public school draws on a diverse population and those who work there shouldn't be pushing their beliefs on kids.

Schools are for educating, not pontificating your personal religious ideals. They have things called Churches for that.  </TEXT>

You can sit here all day showing them proof in the bible about the first murder and it won't move em a bit. If you want to really upset them - tell em that god is the one who controls the weather and if tornados/floods/etc hit towns (usually because someone somewhere in the US likes gay people and lets them have freedom and life) - they will insist they have 'climate science', 'weathermen', etc who can 'predict' the weather. You can't predict when god will judge sinners (note: divorce, drinking, eating shrimp, etc aren't sins - just being gay is).

Folks like us, we are absolute geniuses compared to them, we know the truth. Git r done!

<TEXT> Honestly, I don't care either way. I just come here to post and comment on some news/politics/and a few other things. The bot picked me up. I get all replies to my mail, and it sent like 5/7 messages. Never heard of it, you, etc, and honestly don't give a shit either way.

But looking at reddit rules and such I would speculate that the 'joke' isn't seen as a joke and more as an attempt at harassment of others. Which no one really wants. If you are looking for a reason why one bot is allowed and one is not that seems like the most likely reason.

Just putting my 2 cents in. I do find it funny though that is labeled me/inferred I am some sort of SJW. Now that is a hoot. Damn, people on liberal boards tell me I am libertarian/a little right, conservatives think I am a flaming liberal (not fond of modern day cons myself, more old school and perhaps closer to some UK style cons on some issues).

I really don't care enough about people on reddit and their opinions to bother with bots. But to each their own. Just wish they would leave me out of it.

<TEXT> **Duggar cached website: "Rape and incest represent heinous crimes and as such should be treated as capital crimes"**

Q. What is your abortion position, and specifically, where do you stand on rape, incest, and threat to the mothers health?

A. If a woman is raped, the rapist should be executed instead of the innocent unborn baby. Adoption is an option. Many couples would love to adopt and are waiting for a baby. Abortion has been and always will be the destruction of an innocent child. Rape and incest represent heinous crimes and as such should be treated as capital crimes. The developing infant committed no crime and should be allowed to live. In the unlikely event that the life of both mother and baby would both be lost (for example, a tubal pregnancy) all should be done to save the life of the mother.

<TEXT> Demographics: Citizens with guns shooting other citizens.

Since we don't pay citizens and they don't work for us there isn't really much we can do about it other than what we already are. If the people we employ are shooting folks there is a lot more we are empowered to do about it.

Can't control everyone else, but the people who are supposed to answer to us we should be able to. Oddly enough, conservatives are the ones who most get in the way and try to shield employees who don't do their jobs properly.

People with power (guns) abuse that power and we arrest them, give them a trial, send them to jail.

People with power (cops) abuse that power and some people set up gofundme accounts to cheer them on and claim that they just shot people because they were scared (notice they never want to look at details when it isn't cops shooting people - they just look at the numbers....) </TEXT>

Police have the ability to detain/arrest people and deliver them to where justice can be served - it is all part of a process. Cops are rarely at the scene of a crime when it happens (robberies, rapes, murders, etc). They are there to be called if someone sees something going wrong or survives something.

<TEXT> What is the role of a cop in society? They cannot protect you all of the time. They can arrest violators if they are caught in the commission of a crime. How many people are shot in the US, or stabbed, etc a year in the US?

If you believe that the cops sole job is to protect you then I don't know what to tell you.

<TEXT> Oh, I dunno, you must be right. Cops exist just so we won't kill each other. That is why there is one cop to one person - so they can stand around and watch to make sure we don't shoot each other.

ROFL. Riiight. I mean, if we didn't have police departments everyone would kill each other all day long (sounds rather biblical - original sin, etc). 

We have, what, about 400 cops per 100,000 people. And their job is to stop all those people from killing each other. Okey dokey.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can see that the full retard division has shown up.

You know, the basic "If you help people it will encourage people to become homeless to get free stuff" brigade.

Right. Because people want to be homeless for a year or more and suffering just to get a cheap place to live * facepalm* 

Reminds of how conservatives have been preaching that if we extend unemployment benefits people won't look for work, and then turn around and claim there aren't any jobs because of evil ole Obama. Again, thinking that people enjoy taking huge cuts in pay and having an uncertain future.

These are the same folks who yammer on about us needing to pay more money for more wars so that we can have peace. We inaded Iraq? Let's do it again! And hey, while over there let's hit up Iran too.

Maybe those countries don't want us to invade them, maybe they don't want our 'help', and maybe a lot of us don't want to spend money on more wars and killing but actually helping people here - because it isn't terrorism or Iraq that is causing the pain/suffering/death here. 

Dear conservatives, stop being so damn stupid when it comes it basic crap so many other countries get right. Like health care/single payer. You want to save American lives, focus on what is actually killing them (hint: it isn't terrorism or 'laziness'). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ever watch a police chase? How many end with that may shots on unarmed citizens?

Ohhhh. I see. You think cops should just unload their weapons on unarmed people. Just let their 'animal' instincts take over. After all of those shots you still think a guy should jump on the hood of the car and keep shooting. What are they, storm troopers who can't shoot straight?

Reminds me of conservatives. They want to investigate Benghazi for years but when cops kill people here just shrug and say "They had it coming". Riiight. And if you don't see how the two connect, think about this:

4 Americans died in a hot zone and the right wants someone's head for it - someone here in the US they can blame. So much so they have had multiple investigations and don't blame the people who did it, they never talk about them, but want someone in government held accountable.

Yet, right here in the US, cops can kill unarmed people - not just in this case - and the right just shrugs and blames the people killed and backs the government. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depends. I spoke up several times on issues, which gets IA(internal affairs) involved. It made my life hell there. 

Imagine a police force like being a very very partisan website when it comes to politics. Sometimes, people don't listen to reason and see anyone who doesn't agree as a threat - ala the old "you are with us or against us".

There has to be a will, not just by a few officers, but by the public and those in power, to take it serious. I was harassed by senior deputies (sgt/lt). It didn't help that I personally knew the sheriff and he had hired me in. Keep in mind, the sheriff is elected and comes and goes, and he/she has to play politics with those who have been there awhile. 

Police forces are, for a big part, political entities. They won't reform themselves from within. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't care how it is sliced and diced, way too many shots were fired at two unarmed people in a car. The cops probably fired more bullets at that car than the entire UK police force has fired this century.

They obviously weren't even looking, just shooting - all based on a 'belief' that the people were armed. When we stop holding cops accountable we are giving them a green light to continue on this path and we will see more of it. 

It is a sad day when you are more afraid of cops who carry guns than citizens that do. </TEXT>

They care about one thing - winning elections. And when they win they want to work to dismantle things from science to epa. Their whole philosophy is stuck in the stone ages and based on 'just pray - god will save us. Oh, and give us money for more weapons, cause we really don't believe god will save us'.

They used 9/11 to make wars, patriot act, tsa, and to consolidate more power - power which, suddenly, they think is wrong since Obama is president. Now, again - rather suddenly, they want lots of investigations into an attack. Something they didn't want much of when it came to 9/11 ("Don't criticize the president, we were attacked, real patriots would stand by him and wave flags!"). </TEXT>

I guess the lesson is - shoot all you want, just tell folks you were reasonably scared, and you have nothing to worry about. Unless, of course, you are a lowly citizen and not a government employee. </TEXT>

Concise, simple, and was a breaking news item (but you aren't allowed to say that in the title here). I will note, for those who may need this information, a website called "google" will assist you in learning more about something if honestly interested.

<TEXT> This isn't new. It was reported on 9/13/2012 by CNN (and presumably others).

I guess it is new to people who only cared to hear what they wanted back then and because con news sources were all whining about the video and obama not using the word 'terror' seconds after the attack.

Once more, the right got played by their own news outlets who distracted them.

Even Hillary noted it was a small group (which they were):

http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/12/world/africa/libya-attack-jihadists/

Elsewhere we see that there were folks saying it could have been a planned attack but no one was sure "at that point" (kind of like how folks aren't always sure a cop shooting someone was justified at that point until they investigate).

The admin also said they didn't think it was Al Qaeda, which it wasn't. And "He stressed Zawahiri's threat was only three lines in a forty something minute video tape. Given the language in the tape, analysts would tend not to have concluded an immediate attack was likely."

<TEXT> Not just the cops - conservatives. If this were a group of black people doing this all we would hear about is "welfare, absent dads, crime rate amongst blacks" and so on and so on.

Then, someone would bring up "Black on Black crime" and whine like little babies about how "Black people don't get upset when citizens kill each other but do when government employees do" as though it means something (in other words, they will ask things like 'why aren't blacks protesting other blacks killing each other?' as though that is even close to an intelligent question).

Now imagine the bikers were muslims....jeeebus, it would be all over fox, every single forum on the net, with people screaming.

White folks do crime? Meh. They don't represent Christians, gun owners, or straight people. They are seen as individuals with problems.

Yeah, not dealing with people playing with a full deck. I expect him to say something like that.

The American Taliban just wants to push jeebus, 'christian values', and the idea that the only problems, ever, in the US are because people are just lazy. All the while believing that companies can do no wrong, never do, and if we just remove all epa regulations companies would hire people and never, ever, harm our water supplies, air, and so on.

<TEXT> Now imagine much of the populace listens to fox news and believes it. 14 years after 9/11 the only thing they talk about is the benghazi episode on 9/11 where most people died, bush was a hero, etc and so on.

Between hannity, rush, levin, fox news, and the emperor I can easily see why people might discount facts and history - because some people are just dumb. Han probably listened to a rw con radio show all day while flying in the Falcon ;)

(It's a joke people) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah....no.

The US is so far behind other countries on this it isn't even funny.

I have 5 kids, with a few different ladies, over my near 50 years. Each one is different. Pregnancy and child birth are different for each person. 

Conservative types tend to try to make things simple and compact based on the few. Hence why they are so regressive on things. 

Which is funny - because when it comes to religion (for example) they go on 'belief' and get upset when challenged. When it comes to protestors about government (police) abuses they call everyone looters. When it comes to women having kids they think of them as simple factories and want those women back out and 'producing' again in no time.

And yeah - I agree, add matching time for mother and father. Try having a wife really sick (who, btw, died some years later because of her health issues) and being punished by the company you are working for because you took one day over the allotted 3 to care for her.

Conservatives like to make everything about their real god - money.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why? Maybe because you have access to more information. I am in the US and I watched the entire 7 hour house of commons discussion on gay marriage. It was illuminating. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZNpzdkzWIA

Having access to views other than you own can be a freeing thing. Some though don't want their views challenged and rely solely on 'faith'. 

Conservatives don't generally like facts - hence why they want text books not to mention evolution, cut library funding, why they only listen to those who espouse their own 'beliefs'. The internet opens up the world to a sharing of information and knowledge - which directly challenges conservatives and is one reason they don't like it and find it 'liberal'. Facts aren't liberal, but the right sure does like to call em that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Consider this. One of the things they often ask (not saying always, honestly not sure but I have seen it asked on the forms) is if you have ever had sex with another male. Suppose you were molested as a kid/teen. You answer yes and suddenly your aren't able to donate/sell blood. 

It was (last time I looked) overly broad. Not to mention you could be much older and you fooled around when you were a teen, etc and so on.

Broad policy is too broad. It's as simple as that.

<TEXT> Don't really agree. Yes, I am disappoint in some of his actions (like this one, drones, etc) but overall I don't think this admin stands against 'everything' libs/progs want. Gays in the military, something done with health care (though not single payer), leaving Iraq, not going to war in Syria and Iran...plenty of positive compared to if we had a republican in power.

I am an independent who leaned republican in the 80's an 90's - but since then repubs have went batshit crazy. George Bush was worst president in my 50 years of life and I can't imagine someone like cruz being president.

I'll take a bad dem over anything the crazy party has to offer any day. Hell, I'd take UK's David Cameron over any US person currently running on the repub side.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  *Blacks and Latinos make up just more than a third of the citys population, yet those groups made up nearly two-thirds of the citys traffic stops, including searches.*

I am guessing that if they stopped and searched people of other races the same amount they might find the same issues that crop up here. 

 Cordell shows that police have pulled over, searched and handcuffed blacks and Latinos at higher rates last year than their share of the citys overall population.

When you grow up in an area like this and you are stopped more often than whites, cuffed, etc, it may have some affect on you. If 10% of the people driving have an open container, pot, etc in the car and you pull over one race more than another...chances are you will get more of that race going to jail. Which then leads people to say "See, higher crime, more cops there to catch them!" which just feeds the original problem. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wonder if they spend much time talking about how Laura Bush killed someone and how she felt about that? Probably not - because, as I recall, after the bush failure and 9/11 happened the right was telling us that we needed to be real Americans/Patriots and stand behind Bush.

They don't like Obama because he beat them twice, which has really brought out the nutcases. Look at their reactions to 9/11 and Beghazi as but one example out of hundreds. It's not rational - it requires people to be emotionally unsettled.

They let hate fuel them and toss out their principles in favor of it. They rally behind theocracy loving people like ted cruz and act like and American isis because they fear god will send hurricanes/etc on America because gay marriage. That is not rational - but they firmly believe god himself cares and will punish America. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Conservatives lose on the issues and logic, so they appeal to baser things like emotion. Look at the whole Benghazi debacle - been investigate and it hurt their feelings that it didn't find what they had all been claiming. So they cried a lot and investigated more. And they keep doing it.

They emotionally got behind an Iraq war, believed lies, and cheered on expansion of powers for the government with patriot act/tsa/etc. It made them feel patriotic (compare to the ACA, they love to call it Obama care, but the Patriot act they shy away from connecting bush to).

Another emotion they live with is fear. They are afraid of immigrants, isis, blacks, and non-christian people. People like Rush and Hannity know this and play on those fears - and cons tune in en masse to be preached to by father figures who tell them everything will be alright if just pray, wave flags, buy more bombs, and help less people in need. </TEXT>

Going by their views divorced people shouldn't be allowed to marry, non believers to believers, etc and so on.

I don't get it. Well, I kind of do. These super smart people are sure that God will rain down destruction on the US if gays can marry (even though they can in many countries). God doesn't care about the sick and poor being screwed over, wars like Iraq, crime, and so on. Nope. Just gays.

Your god sucks and you don't truly believe in him (Heck, based on the fundies we don't need a military, God will just swoop down and destroy the bad people....oh wait...the right pushes for more military. Maybe because they think their god is a wimp?) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes...It will liberate you from your rights, your lands, your own religious ideals, and in some cases - your life.

It is interesting, to me anyway, how the rw fundies in this country now claim that Christianity is 'better' and more liberal than it was before (which they state when talking about Islam/Isis/etc).

Which basically says: "Yeah, we changed our faith and beliefs, but we won't do that now. And we believe that other faiths aren't as advanced/liberal as ours is now. But we hate liberals and progressive ideals."

Your faith was wrong before, you reformed it time and time again, and yet now you think it is all ok and doesn't need to change anymore. I am a little skeptical. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Difference is - this guy doesn't represent most on the left. The right is a small tent made up of fundies and people who all think mostly alike. Hate muslims, don't want to allow their fellow american citizens (gays) to serve their country or get married, think all poor people are lazy welfare bums, etc.

I can find wackos on the left to be sure (am an independent and have been registered so since 1984 - though I did vote for both reagan and bush) but they represent less of the group because there is less group think on the left and more fractured 'tents' (some are pro gun, some anti, some religious, some not, etc and so on).

Pick any given conservative and you will find they represent a large chunk of them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The things which are harming Americans the GOP loves and embraces by blaming those people for it.

The things we already have defense against and aren't killing us they want to spend money on.

All in the name of Jesus. Because we all know true conservative fundies believe you can pray away sickness, being homeless, hungry etc - but you can't rely on a weak god to protect you so you have to spend money on weapons. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, since women are physically different than men I can see some of their uniforms reflecting that. The universe isn't unisex.

<TEXT> Do whites treat other whites poorly at times? Do they discriminate against other whites (like Irish, etc)?

Weird how this works. Some just assume all blacks see all other blacks as the same but when it comes to whites they don't expect that. 

Does it help to be better represented when it comes to race, class, etc and so on? I would say it does. Does that automatically solve all the problems in the system? I would say it doesn't.

So you can have a legit gripe about being represented on X but that doesn't always lead to Y and Z. 

The right only hears one thing when it comes to this issue. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's cute. The idea is that government employees are abusing power (like the right complains about with Obama, but didn't with bush...weird. Anyway,) and have been doing so and getting away with it.

The justice system favors some over others. A point the people were protesting about. I don't think people were complaining that those who were abusing power were all white, but were all in a position of power.

Now...are blacks sentenced, arrested, charged, pulled over, etc in a disproportionate amount? If so - isn't that something worth looking at? Does it matter who does it? 

Weren't white people (jews/pols/gays/etc) killed by other whites in ww2? Are you saying that if they complained they were being targeted that they had no case because they were all white?

Classicism, etc, are all real problems. But leave it to someone to ignorantly yell "There are some black cops, so all is ok! Git r done buddies!" </TEXT>

<TEXT> When people are used to being abused by cops - either unwarranted stops, searches, etc - they might just have a case for avoiding them quickly. 

Waco and Ruby Ridge - why didn't people just obey the cops? Bundy Ranch - why didn't they guy just pay the fine, why did so many show up with guns?

The right seems to have no problem in justifying their distrust of government but when others do it they suddenly get all weird. You watch the protests? When cops were approaching many people ran - why didn't the cops just beat em and shoot em? Maybe because they knew it was wrong...when the cameras were rolling. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The blame I see has more than one facet.

The war on (some) drugs. Targeting areas, using tickets/etc as a revenue source, and so on. 

As I said before, I can blame individuals and the system. I can't fix individuals, but we can work and fix the system and the people we pay to manage that system.

Not in favor of the riot side, but large protests and stuff do seem to get the message out. Think about the 60's and civil rights and vietnam. 

That does not mean I can't try to understand why people do what they do (even if I don't agree with their actions). Simply dismissing things as people being hoods/thugs/etc is easy but ignores underlying causes.

It is like how the right says "Muslims over there in the middle east are bad, do bad things, and hate us fer our freedoms! Git R Done!" and don't stop to think for a minute about the causes behind some of the things - like us overthrowing their leaders, etc.

Simple minded people see simple minded solutions. They usually watch fox and listen to rush who play to that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So many things work well in theory that don't in reality.

Let's look at ole bush. Torture happens, he skates. Cheney shoots some guy in the face, meh. 

Big companies screw the country and get bailouts. Companies contribute to deaths, basically steal from people, etc and pay a small fine.

All things people have exposed and the justice system ignores. What was is the conservatives have been saying since 2008? Something about the tree of liberty, etc....

You think the people in Ferguson hadn't been trying to make changes for years? It took the protests to get real reports on the corruption and change to start.

The people in power (and those with money) have to have the will to change things. They get lazy and comfortable until some things wake them up.

Ferguson and Baltimore both got people talking about issues they generally ignore - which is weird because we have so many 24x7 news stations. Politicians can get elected and try to do something, but then party politics take over and legislation and funding go nowhere. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That made no sense.

*So why was this kid, and so many others, happy to give the corrupt police a reason to screw them?*

Your saying that corrupt cops needs chances/reason to act corrupt and then blame the victim for not avoiding them? So...if you go 5 mph over the speed limit and a cop stops you and beats the crap out of you then you are at fault? Hunh. Weird.

Sounds like conservative style thinking about an issue. "Why, if them folks in Iraq had kicked out Saddam like we wanted, we wouldn't have had to bomb em up real good!" </TEXT>

Yeah, I am sure just about every criminal can claim the same. Funny how these people don't care about police abuse of power, people getting charged with 'resisting', ticketed for filming cops or being harassed by them, etc.

Now, suddenly, they want people to stop and think about things.

<TEXT> I am not interested in individuals and their personal problems - from what crimes they have done to anything else.

People in government with power that abuse it, though, is something we should care about and can do something about. We pay them, they work for us. 

Cops are to protect/serve. When cops fail at that we should come down on them for failing to do their job. I would think conservatives would be all for that.

When you have a system that is a mess we should be outraged. The justice system screws over people daily. That is part of why the US has more people in prison than other countries. People on the right tend not to pay attention to this (in fact, they see a way to make money from it with private prisons/etc).

Their usual solutions are things like "get a job", "more prayer in schools" and so on. All because those things require no thinking. The deep issues that exist get glossed over and ignored in favor of what people see in a rather twisted light "I haven't been arrested, beaten, screwed over by the system - so you can avoid it to if you act like me!"

And what that is your solution - you haven't seen the real problem at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You keep saying "dem/republican".

There are plenty of people in both parties who lean conservative or liberal on some issues. I am talking about core values - not party.

*I think the real problem is lack of police training/internal controls and the culture that lets them think they could get away with arresting someone without cause and then intentionally not putting a seatbelt on the guy.*

As a former LEO I can tell you that is, indeed, a problem. That problem gets exacerbated by the the entire justice system - but yes, it starts with the cops IMHO (not always).

When people in a certain area are targeted for enforcement than in other areas you get a lot more 'crime' suddenly. Jay walking, riding a bike with no helmet, 'speeding/distracted driving/rolling stops' etc and so on.

Those people now have to take time from work for court, pay more fines, etc than people in other areas. All the while other people do the same and get ignored - and then those people point to those other areas/people start to get biased and demand more police to bust more people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As expected people totally miss it. 

Cons are rushing to push the whole meme "It's a dem city, so we don't expect there would be social issues" which is kind of funny when you think about it....

The two groups look at the issue in a different way. I don't care the politics of the city. People in power in either party can, and do abuse power. So this isn't about party politics but about perception of real issues.

Conservatives blow off those who have regular problems and side with those in government and stand up for them (unless, of course, it's that one guy in Office, Obama). They blame the victims of government power abuse and incompetence.

Liberals tend to see the issue as something that is fundamentally wrong with the system and how it works, while also saying if someone did something wrong they should be held accountable. But many aren't because they aren't poor, minority, etc. 

I would think the right would care about unequal justice and abuse of the system against the citizens. But they keep proving me wrong by siding against the people they don't like and patting those doing the abuse on the back.

Pretend like it was obama making the arrest and someone dying. Issa/Gowdy would do 15 investigations, fox would carry it 24x7 and demand justice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not even really talking about Ferguson. I am talking about issues every day across the US when it comes to cops and the justice system. Ferguson was about that build up, so was Baltimore. There were breaking points. The right is quick, especially now, to dismiss and use Ferguson to say "See, there wasn't any issue at all!" when the point protestors were making is crap happens every damned day.

Sure, some of it is small (being harassed, pulled over a lot, etc by cops). But some is larger. Extra charges tacked on, unequal protection and so on.

Conservatives tend to only care about a few big incidents ignoring the elephant in the room. </TEXT>

People who generally ignore the plight of people who have complained for decades about problems with the justice will suddenly pay attention and find fault it in .

When it's blacks, indians, hispanics, poor people getting screwed over every single day they just shrug and tell em "If you wouldn't have got arrested you wouldn't be in this situation, obey the law, get a job, etc"

Sure as hell though when one of said group are unarmed and die by cop they are out there setting up gofundme's for the cop(s), raging out injustice etc.

<TEXT> It goes like this. There were several investigations done that found nothing. Then there is another investigation that drags on and you want it to drag on more, so you order those other documents to slow things down.

Imagine if 9/11/2001 were investigated like this, it would still be going on. Some things would be classified, then there would be court battles over a few of them, they get released, then more and and when it's all done there is another investigation just for the hell of it and you slowly ask for all that same documentation as before *and* new docs to explore what people said about those other docs later...

It's like the never ending story. Well...until the election. Then suddenly it will wrap up with what we learned the first time. </TEXT>

They are licking their chops on this right now. They promote every negative story on iran, muslims, blacks, and raise funds for cops that shoot people and spending on wars/weapons. Funny how it all works in their minds. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My personal take on it:

Obi Wan was there to look after Luke on Tatooine and set him on his path/protect him. By dying here he was able to better aid Luke now in the long term and continue his mission. 

Both he and Luke now progressed and Vader was under the impression that the last of the Jedi's was gone, which upped his arrogance that it was just he, the emperor, and the empire. Yoda was surely too old and probably dead, Obi Wan gone, there was no one left to teach, so his guard on that front would be down.

Again, just my guess :) </TEXT>

Not in the market myself but eventually might be when I move in a few years. I am just not overly trusting of alarm companies (no rational reason off the top of my head, just one of them things). </TEXT>

Now, one could note the year of the article, 2011. Which means you are probably just trolling for comments (another sign of a conservative who can't win arguments).

But hey, carry on, fun to see cons squirming and twisting. Makes me all happy :) </TEXT>

Um, was there a way to 'close the door'? If not then they didn't leave the door open they just didn't decide at this time to do it.

Against the ban myself. Since most crimes involving the shooting of cops aren't planned and arise out of circumstance I don't think there is much basis to ban these because of cops. If someone is planning on killing a cop, any old bullet would do if you plan it out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So what? According to conservatives all you have to do is work harder. Sure, you might work 2 or 3 jobs, but if you aren't getting all you want in life from work that is your fault.

And now someone is trying to blame, what, blame immigrants? LOL. Ok.

Remember when republicans voted against an extension for unemployment benefits? They said aid to those unemployed made them lazy and if they cut aid those lazy people would get jobs?

According to them there are tons of jobs out there. And the only reason your income is dropping is you are lazy and you aren't training yourself for new jobs.

And now they are trying to blame immigrants?? Yeah...get your message straight. </TEXT>

But most middle-class families arent seeing the improvement in their daily lives.  So weve got a lot more work to do. "*

And yet he lays out no plans to do this, claims government doesn't create jobs, fights UI extension, wants to cut food stamps, welfare, school lunches. The only plan the republicans ever have is tax cuts for the wealthy, increase defense spending, 'reforming' social security, and pushing a pipeline. All the while ignoring infrastructure.

And he says 'where are the jobs'. Well, I dunno, you said people didn't need a UI extension because it made them lazy and they wouldn't find work - so you must believe there are plenty of jobs for them to work. </TEXT>

Can't say I am shocked that a group that advocates for less immigrants is saying this and that a rw rag is picking it up. 

This same group claims *The Center has asserted that there are adverse effects of immigration on the environment* - which is odd because according to the right humans have no affect on the environment and if they do it is ok because 'profit'. "Sure, dumping this waste in the lake kills all the fish and ruins your ability to drink it - but the government shouldn't stop a company from creating jobs!"

<TEXT> Think about your avg republican voter here. They don't think or care about such things really. They just want to use deaths for their own gain. 9/11/2001? Support the president or you are a traitor, use the deaths for new laws and wars.

We aren't dealing with rational people who care about the US, they just want to 'win' elections because 'winning' is awesome. When Obama won and they lost they decided to do all they could to destroy that loss, not support him (like they did bush after 9/11), and whine daily about things - including making up things (he was born in kenya, will confiscate all guns, destroy stock market, let ebola kill us all, etc).

It isn't about country for them. I would like one conservative to tell me they honestly care about this country and always did - but that won't happen because what they care about is getting some human, any human on the planet, into office with an (R) after their name. They are mad, sad (sore losers) over 2008/2012 and they care about nothing at all but 'winning' - then suddenly, not matter what or who is in office they will kneel on their flags and open their bibles and just praise them.

Just like they worshiped bush. The greatest man, to them, in the 21st century, who saved America. Yeah...I won't ever make the mistake of voting for a republican in my life again. </TEXT>

Last week's removal of a screaming Alondra Luna from her middle school last week provoked an outcry from her family, who said authorities ignored proof of her identity. 
 
Federal police said they were acting on a judge's orders to send the girl to Dorotea Garcia, who says the girl had been illegally taken to Mexico by her father years ago. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, ok. Here is how I view it - there should be outrage whenever government agents/employees kill people. Waco and Ruby Ridge sure as hell got some people up in arms. Ah, but those were white people I guess and the right suddenly cared.

It's not my fault that white cons don't get upset when white people get killed by cops. Maybe that is because, in general, they don't care when cops shoot people. They feel it is always justified. 

If you have some cases where white people were killed/hurt/etc by cops you think should be discussed because you come down on the side of the person being injured by the cops - post em. And I will back the victim of police brutality.  </TEXT>

I didn't have any issue with them wanting to look into the whole ordeal and get some basic answers. But jeebus, it has gotten downright silly. 

On the other hand, it really does show they have nothing else, at all, when it comes to Obama. They were wrong about him being born in kenya, wrong about him when they said he would crash the market, take all the guns, turn the US into a caliphate, threw open the borders, etc and so on.

They got nothing, and this just is making them look stupid.

You would think there would be some on the right who would see this and tell em to stuff it -but they are too invested now emotionally to act rationally.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> MSM is in the business of making money, and they make a lot of it from corporations that advertise on their shows. 

Add in to that the big wigs in these media companies probably own stakes in gas/oil and make more profit if said companies do well (see Sanders and his take on raising royalties on land the govt leases for drilling/etc).

The internet is allowing more and more information to find it's way into the public than ever before - another reason some companies want to have more control over it. 

I don't even have a tv plugged in anywhere but the kitchen, where I like to listen to a show while I cook. News sources for me are a pick and choose online. With twitter I follow every TV news station in the US (about 600 of them total, ignoring some duplicate stations and pbs ones). 

Radio is mostly owned by a few corporations who restrict the local licenses (they buy them up and you can't get one - they let them sit silent to kill competition). The internet is leveling the playing field more and more. </TEXT>

It obviously isn't discrimination against christians - they probably did something bad like run from government isis soldiers who told them to stop, failed to obey orders from 'cops' etc.

Sure...maybe some were killed because they were different, but that's just a few bad apples.

<TEXT> I'll just repost what I said in another thread on this:

Is that some sort of conservative attempt at a 'gotcha' moment? Man, cons are funny people.

Ever hear the old adage "It takes money to make money"? in cases like this, yes, you use resources you have in an attempt to make a change regarding the use of said resources.

You might run a website discussing the over use of coal, and it might be powered by electricity generated by coal. That doesn't make the information you are presenting bad, it is using the system to fight the system.

Investing in the short term to change the long term, etc. But hey, it makes some people get all giddy and say "See, climate change and such isn't real! I is smurt man now, I saw someone use gas in their car and they drove to park on earth day to pick up litter! Hypocrites - it means thar ain't no problems! Wheeee look at me, I'm a super smart science minded conservative!"

<TEXT> Let me try to explain the disconnect.

Man is working hard to support himself and kid. It's not enough. So he gets assistance. The right calls him a bum, welfare queen, etc, and runs around posting stories about how people like him are living up eating lobster and can't possibly be poor because he owns a tv.

Then: The right sits around telling people "If you work hard, you can make it!" all the while ignoring that working hard doesn't mean that at all. It usually means you are getting taken advantage of by people who aren't working hard but running things because they invested in a company and they feel they deserve more of the profits than those doing the actual work.

Those people the right cheers (investors) but when workers ask for me they get called greedy and we are told it will hurt the company and raise prices.

A more progressive view is that, sure, I don't have a problem with investors/etc making more - but I also think kicking down more to the people doing the actual work is the right thing to do.

Here's the thing for me: Despite what the right tells you....not every human can own their own company and be a millionaire. There would be no workers. We need workers to pick up trash, build things, cook, stock shelves, etc. They are just as much a part of this economy as anyone else and while they may not invest money they do invest time (though they do invest money in a way by getting a car, gas for work, right clothes, showers each day, etc and so on). </TEXT>

<TEXT> It isn't necessarily that more people favor gay marriage (although they do) - I think, perhaps, more now favor less religion in our government as a reason for having some laws.

The rw argument is our nation will be destroyed, mainly by god, if we allow gays to marry, serve in the military, etc. 

They don't think in a logical manner, they think in a religious way like their cousins in isis/etc. More people nowadays think more for themselves and don't need some invisible sky daddy to play dictator.

Real freedom is something conservatives fight against because it isn't something they can control with bible verses and fear. They want everyone to be obedient to what they are because they are scared if they don't force people to god will do bad things to us all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here is what republicans want:

-Back Israel and push for Armageddon so Jesus will return.

-Ban teaching of evolution and sex ed in schools

-War with Iran (so they can "support the troops" and honor them when they get killed/injured)

-Kick people off food stamps, health care, welfare, unemployment benefits while killing jobs and then calling people lazy (like how they called the unemployed lazy while blaming obama for them not being able to get jobs....)

-Gut science when it comes to climate change and space, funnel money into more guns for peace

-Privatize more schools and prisons so their backers can profit (money is the true god of the right, the golden calf if you will)

-Ban gay marriage, kick gays out of the military - all so that they can save America from hurricane and floods (and earthquakes, like in Oklahoma which are being caused by fracking, but the right denies it because it is science and not in the bible).

And so much more.

<TEXT> Another weird thing is that Jews don't believe Jesus was the son of god, basically they are 'atheists' when it comes to Christianity. 

*Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness?*

Overall, Jews reject the ideas of Christians but fundies have bound themselves to those who reject their beliefs. They see Israel as their path to both salvation from punishment and to the end times. Their belief is that if they are nice to a nation that rejects the very core of their beliefs they will get some sort of favor in return (and they seem to forget all the times god punished israel/judah for rejecting him....).

Their allegiance doesn't really make a lot of sense. I can see them as an ally in the region from a strategic point of view. But to put them above reproach and accuse anyone who speaks out against their policies as anti-semitic/hater/anti-christian is just...well, nuts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not the media so much as the actual people themselves, especially (but not only) online.

I follow every tv station in the US on twitter and see plenty of news. Yeah, there are some loons on the left too - another reason I am proudly, and have been since '84 a registered independent.

Now the news I read (out side a few places) generally isn't overly slanted (because I see so much of it). But I do read comments and rw sites/comments. I also listen to a lot of radio and shows on talkshoe (where anyone can broadcast live for free, have a chatroom and phone number for call in).

And the more I have seen/heard the more I am convinced that the rw cons in this country are just plain nuts. Not rational people trying to have a rational discussion. 

As far as hurricanes/gays - just google around. And what you will find are the people saying that are conservatives and republicans. And to make it more interesting try to find someone with that alignment saying it's crazy. They just shrug and ignore it as though they expect it or partially believe it (Christians are a huge chunk of the populace here and the more fundie ones are republicans - and they do believe god punishes the US for it's 'sins)

The left has it's wackos as well, but with a big tent they tend to fight with each other and it balances out in a broad sense. On the right folks tend to march in lockstep on a broad scale. They have a common hate (obama/liberals) and a common core (bible/religion).

The two groups are different. </TEXT>

Conservatives here in the US are, by and large, loony religious zealots. Against gays in military, gay marriage, etc because they fear god will send hurricanes/judge America. 

They insist Obama is a muslim - again, bringing religion into politics. They create policies based on bible verses they take out of context "If a man does not work he does not eat" kind of crap.

Their whole philosophy they back up with god. And yes, they are wanting to punish America. Look at what was being said when Obama was elected; they wouldn't cooperate with him, rush/et al said they hope he (thus we) fail. 

Try listening to rw radio for a week or reading what the loonies are claiming (obama and ebola and how we were all gonna die cause he hates america, the whole stolen libyan jet BS which turned out to be false, Obama will take all the guns with no discussion of how he was going to, etc and so on). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of course the comments are insane - do you know any conservatives that are rational? 

It's all about emotions. They are pissed off because they lost twice and want to punish obama/usa for losing. There is not one conservative that care about this country over their little parties (tea/gop). Think about it: They are mostly fundies who love Israel over the US and are praying daily for Jesus to come back and kill off most the human race. The want this. They live for it.

We're not dealing with sane or rational people. Not one, not one anywhere, will stand up and call BS on things like this, Iraq, etc because they have no courage and no principles. They just have getting on their knees for their party and to pray for god to punish/kill all the sinners.

Loony people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Paul lets conservatives here distance themselves from bush and the iraq war (and tsa/patriot act/etc) while still supporting what they see as conservative ideals.

In reality, they probably don't agree with him on a lot of things. When it comes to Israel, for example, they are still married to the bible above the country whereas (at one point) Paul looked at it from a more practical point of view.

Conservatives are, at their core, religious people. They react based on what they believe god wants or doesn't want. On the country side they don't care about gay marriage - but they believe god will punish a country that allows it. So paul is sort of a go between where they can pretend it isn't about religion while hedging their bets: "I am still a conservative but not really" is pretty much how it goes with them.

Paul gives them street cred early on which they will toss out the window in a heartbeat as soon as they can. They can pretend to have principles and 'look good' right now because they know he won't win. Then later they will push for someone who is truly backwards and regressive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While people in both parties can act that way let's look at some basics.

During the bush admin, yes there were negatives tossed out. But much of it was correct. The economy tanked, wars were a bust, and we lost more freedoms and government got more power.

Obama gets elected and predictions from the GOP are a bust. Obama didn't take all of the guns, he didn't let ebola kill us all, the economy didn't tank and market crash, he wasn't born in Kenya, he didn't force all the conservatives into Fema camps and turn the US into a caliphate.

There is 'negative' and then there is bat shit crazy. The cons in this country are nuts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the insight.

It would be nice, imho, if the media covered more of what reps/etc do locally for people (Joyce Beatty is my rep here in Ohio) or if the reps would put more info out showing how they have helped people locally (again, all of this aside from voting).

I was complaining in an earlier thread (in news) about the lack of local talk shows on radio (consolidation, local shows replaced by big radio names, etc). Way back in my day we had more local radio where politicians actually talked about constituent services and the like.

It seems candidates disappear off the radar (to the media) when elected and the general public doesn't see the day to day work they do and feel more and more isolated from their congressperson. 

Just my 2 cents :) </TEXT>

Seems like there is a lot of 'horsetrading' that goes on in the background, lobbying, politics and the people elected are less interested in what your average person thinks about an issue than they are in bigger/more powerful/influential 'groups'.

I have had success with issues I needed assistance with in the pass by calling my congressperson. Nice people, good information, even made a call on my behalf to help get things resolved. 

But when it comes to voting I just don't see A) that they would listen to me and B) that the congress person ever even knows I called/etc and what it is I said. But - obviously, they can't spend all day listening to people. Not practical.

Can you explain what happens to the letters/calls/etc - are they collated, numbers given, some comments passed on? </TEXT>

As far as Texas:

 3)       Shooting stray Dogs and Cats (Penal Code 42.09 Animal Cruelty).  Any person who shoots a non-livestock animal, which includes any stray or feral cat or dog, and a wild living creature previously captured, can be charged with a felony offense.  Penal Code 42.092 of the State of Texas law states that a person must have the owners consent to kill the animal (exceptions to prosecution are provided in Section 42.092(e)(1)).  It is clear that a stray dog or cat either has no owner or that the person who shoots the animal did not get the owners consent. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Probably because a lot of more progressive people don't need to be babied and lied to in order to support their ideals. Like religious people in the ME or here - they don't want anything that contradicts their beliefs, they want someone to lie to them and validate their hate/fears. 

A smart business person will give them that and get their money in return because they know not one of them would dare challenge someone on what they say. Might put a crack in their armor and belief systems.

Interestingly enough note how rw christians here brag that they are not like muslims and have become more 'progressive' over the centuries. Then they attack the people muslims listen to and tell them there is a better way, etc. 

If only they would take their own advice, not listen but think, and continue trying to be more progressive than they used to be. Again, it is funny how they tout how much more progressive their faith has become - slavery is bad now, blacks can marry whites, women can vote, etc - all progressive ideals compared to the backwards way of how they used to use the bible.

The right needs someone to listen to because deep down they know they are wrong and don't like to face that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That the 20 soldiers/vets who kill themselves a day aren't going to hell.

Fundie conservatives believe that they are (and you can look that up) and religion/hell are popular with them - and their opinion that death by suicide leads to hell is quite popular amongst them

They call the poor, homeless, sick, etc lazy, stupid, weak - even the veterans they claim to care about. But I guess their idea of care is to send them to wars or something.

So, yeah, I guess my view of them will be unpopular to them but it is at least accurate.

Just because a depressed vet (or anyone else) takes their life doesn't mean they will burn in hell forever. I don't care how popular that idea is amongst them, it's stupid. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why does a show have to have a hard political bent? I registered as an independent in 1984, and I have listened to a lot of local shows over the years where the host was pretty open to all sides of things and facilitated discussion instead of trying to overtly control it.

The was licenses are structured now and with consolidation we have lost a lot of local hosts and instead have shows like here on one local station hours of beck, then rush, then hannity, then levin - about 11 hours of rw talk radio on a national level and most of it just fear mongering and distortions.

Oh hey, here is an idea, I could get my own station and start a show, right? No. Big companies have bought up the spectrum here to control and stop competition (same in most markets). 

Yes, I have worked in radio (and still do, albeit internet only at the time - though we can broadcast a pirate signal). 

Radio has become like politics - run by the few for the few and small, local community radio has been taken away for the most part. </TEXT>

The old "I am willing to die for your freedoms" stuff wears old when you have someone who is willing to basically steal from protestors over a piece of cloth.

3 kids, disabled wife (now deceased) who didn't get benefits. Some months we did manage to save a little and got the kids happy meals. It was a huge treat to them but others looked down on us for being 'frivolous'. Long story short, after about 14 months and a hearing before 3 judges I got everything fixed and settlement and went back to work (though I still suffer from the injury, I turned down permanent partial disability so I could work and get out of the system.

I listen to the radio, watch movies, and am happy each day my daughter isn't ill and in the hospital. I get no govt aid, don't ever have hope of getting a car again and working (hard to do without a car/etc) - but each and every day I see her smile and we laugh.

<TEXT> I was at the theater the night it came out. Midnight showing. Only show my dad and I ever went to together (movies just weren't his thing). IIRC I had school the next day but he knew how much I wanted to see it and took me.

Yeah, it was somewhat of a shock. But one of the things that stuck with me was Han and Leia. We didn't know Luke and her were sister/brother (I think I was 14 at the time, no internet, etc). Why was Leia warming up to Han when it seemed like she and Luke would be together?

Heck, I was ok with the whole Luke/Vader thing, thought Yoda was awesome, but why couldn't Luke get the damned girl? Han had Chewbacca, R2 had 3PO, and luke had...well, not leia it seems.

Of course, being a young man my thoughts were with Leia :) And I used to play with my action figures and it always worked out that Luke and Leia were together. Until Jedi... </TEXT>

Weird. 

China, the US, Russia aren't really on that list - but they are the ones supplying arms, starting wars, overthrowing governments, supporting regimes.

What am I missing here? Should she have showered them with glowing praise because someone says she has ties to them? Or is that something conservatives expect because when they are bought and paid for they give such things a pass?

<TEXT> Ohhhh. Rubio...Yeah. This guy:

He criticized judges who are redefining marriage from the bench, claiming that pro-marriage-equality decisions take away the rights of Americans like myself who oppose same-sex marriage: Those who support same-sex marriage have a right to lobby their state legislature to change its laws. But Americans like myself who support keeping the traditional definition of marriage also have the right to work to keep the traditional definition of marriage in our laws without seeing them overturned by a judge.

Calling tolerance a two-way street, he lamented that today there is a growing intolerance on this issue, intolerance towards those who continue to support traditional marriage.

The Florida Family Policy Council announced today that it will host *Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) at its 2013 Annual Dinner. The FFPC is led by John Stemberger, the anti-gay activist who most recently helped launch a Boy Scouts splinter group that will ban openly gay youth, and the fundraiser will honor Liberty Counsel head Mat Staver.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to vote republican. Up until 2004. Now they are so far gone I don't think I will ever, in my lifetime, even consider voting for them. 

But, either way, they are losing the culture war. Their regressive, religious, policies keep getting beaten. 

Consider this. The right complains about ISIS/Fundie muslims all the time. The reason? Because those groups aren't as progressives as they say Christians now are. Think about that. They are actually saying progressive changes are good and regressive fundies (the muslim ones) are evil/bad.

Maybe, just maybe, they will run with that and move to being even more progressive....now that they use the term 'progressive' in a positive light. I won't hold my breath, but what they rail against is, to some extent, what they are here in the US. Regressive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Indeed. In fact, it from one of their playbooks:
1. Cut unemployment benefits because people getting them are milking the system and not getting jobs.

2. Shoot down proposals to spur job creation.

3. Complain that, because of Obama there are no jobs. Blame Obama and the unemployed.

4. Claim to have a solution - cut even more benefits (food stamps) and decrease taxes on the rich so they can create more jobs (oddly enough, again, admitting there aren't enough jobs but cutting benefits anyway and calling those in need lazy welfare bums).

Not much they do makes sense. But then, folks like rush and such wanted America to fail so they can blame Obama and tell people 'told you so' for electing Obama (the old fundie idea of punishing 'sinners')

Conservatives....they want to break America for some reason (and yet, they have failed to do so the last 8 years, which makes them sad). </TEXT>

Local issues don't get enough play. One of the guys that had a show here moved onto 700wlw so I pick him up there but still not really 'local' anymore (same state).

<TEXT> I was one. There were some decent folks on the force but overall there was an atmosphere of corruption and people who let power get to their head. I don't regret leaving there (back in the 80's).

Cops will stab other cops in the back first chance they get to save themselves. I was a friend with the sheriff before I worked there and became friends with the lt. of Internal Affairs (all cops hate IA....). This upset other deputies. You don't want to get on the bad side of those directly above you - they come together and can make your life hell.

We used to tie up some inmates, face down, arms pulled up behind their backs, and leave them like that 45 minutes or so till they were in so much pain they were crying. My senior officer on floor with me one night (mostly worked in the main jail) sat and watched a guy hang himself - we cut him down in time, but he told me not to interfere and let him do it if he wanted. 

There is a corrupt culture and a good old boy's network - but, yeah, there are some good cops. Problem is they fight an uphill battle against the system.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Try looking at it from the view of an investor. You put $x into a company and you push to get as much back out as you can. 

You start a company (investing your time/money) and want to get the most you can from your investment.

People cheer that on. Until the people doing the actual labor (investing their time, and even money on a car, gas, clothes) want more. Then suddenly people talk about 'greed' and how awful it is. 

Prices go up all the time because the first two groups want more. They lay off people, shift jobs to Vietnam, etc, just to grab a few more dollars. But when workers want a bit more of the wealth they are helping to create folks get bent out of shape and pine for the glory days of the early 1800's. 

All of these years of having a min wage and the right still says we are the greatest country on earth, most innovative, wealthiest country, etc. Maybe it isn't the big boogeyman people have made it out to be after all. </TEXT>

Anywho...this will all pan out in the long run. More people with more money spread a tiny bit more evenly. People have whined about the min wage since I was 18 and making 3.35/hr and the country is still going strong. </TEXT>

<TEXT> People don't jump on fox without cause.

It was, for fox, a decently written article. But note the use of the word 'activists' (5 times) and how and when in the past they have used that term. In the article they state: *Though Lomax is tied to the oil-and-gas industry* note they aren't calling him any sort of 'activist'. 

Fox didn't question the author worth a damn. They basically just reposted what he said without 'peer reviewing' him. Now, as far as the peer reviewing- they don't even explain what it is or how it works, which may sound silly. Until you think about this:

**The journal's editors send the article to several other scientists who work in the same field (i.e., the "peers" of peer review). Those reviewers provide feedback on the article and tell the editor whether or not they think the study is of high enough quality to be published.**

So peers review the data. And in this case, where one could make an issue with the data, is in who collected it (which is outlined in the actual paper). But that doesn't detract from the actual paper or the findings about the air samples. Other people who have done similar research reviewed the paper and found it acceptable. 

If, in fact, you read what the peers wrote you will see that they had questions themselves about some things. One reviewer states that air testing near such operations is very difficult and this is not a final answer but is valuable because it assesses areas identified by the public. All of them offered revisions and had some questions. 

None of this was expanded upon by fox, discussed, etc. Thei 'journalism' was basically reposting and asking a few pointed questions to the reviewers. Basically - typical fox clickbait that doesn't require a person to think. </TEXT>

Then in 2012 they said the same thing, that he was just waiting until his second term to ban them all. Again, no mention of how he could but were told he would.

Apparently they were wrong. Again. And still no one will own up to the lies and hype. Benghazi!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> If I may:

I understand all too well the conditioning. And then there is the history, and community, and perhaps biggest of all, acceptance by others (family, friends, etc).

What you wanted, in being a wise old jewish man on a mountain, was a sense of purpose and knowledge that you thought perhaps would help not only you but also others (I don't know, speculating).

You existed in a framework. And you wanted to do well within that framework. 

Now I would like to look at it from a different view for a moment - in part because just the other night on fedflix (old govt movies) I watched a show about Jews in Chicago, made by the police department.

I ventured to guess, while watching it, that there were probably some in the Jewish community who weren't really believers (at least to some extent). But that they knew and understood the importance of culture and history and the things which tie people together. Sure - maybe moses never existed, but the traditions passed down had a net positive influence so such things were worth keeping and celebrating because of the larger lessons they conveyed.

Religion is a mufti-facteted thing and sometimes leaders see that even when they don't believe in the facts of story. There is worth in a common past, those experiences can be celebrated, understood, and carried on. Not always my cup of tea of course :)

Anyway, sorry if I am off the mark, I am personally dealing with a lot myself in this arena (though not from a jewish perspective). </TEXT>

<TEXT> What is it you are debating actually? That there can't be anything higher than humans? That something you can't see can't possibly exist? That the only things which can be are the things we can see and understand with our current technology?

Logically, such debates aren't even really debates. The more we learn the more we realize there is that we don't know. It would be like complaining that theoretical physicists and things they talk about are bunk because they haven't been proven. Proof requires the ability to prove things which may be currently beyond our physical capabilities. You don't discard such things out of hand but try to understand how the theories came to be, are they plausible, etc and so on.

Agnostics are the theoretical branch, imho, of atheism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The point is there doesn't have to be a point. As humans we discuss a great many things and disagree on them. Sports, for example. I can easily get into a debate about the Buckeyes being better than other teams (which I have done a lot of....) when it comes to football. It won't matter in the end but people have views on things and shit happens.

Now, as to 'those who can't be reasoned with' I would tend to disagree on that in a broad sense. Sure, right now they can't, but part of that is because few challenge them directly. Popping the bubble people live in isn't usually a one time affair. But the more they see that others aren't like them (on beliefs/etc) the more their bubble is altered. 

A door opened a crack today by you could be opened a bit more tomorrow by someone else. I wouldn't say it is a goal to change the mind of people but to open the minds of others to help them better determine for themselves certain things.

Ignorance, on many things, hurts us all, and picking up even little bits of 'education' on something here and there can lead to better things down the road.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They were elected to stop the policies of Barack Obama and the Democrat Party, Limbaugh asserted. Unfortunately, however, Republicans are making it clear that they intend on working together with Democrats and the president to get things done, particularly Obamas free trade agenda.

Ive got a lot of members who believe that international trade agreements are a winner for America and the president and I discussed that right before I came over here, said Senator McConnell, who among other Republicans, shares Obamas vision about the trade partnerships. I think hes interested in moving forward. I said, Send us trade agreements; were anxious to look at them.

Even Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has voiced his support for the trade agreements, encouraging the president to prioritize passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Speaking at the Center for the National Interest dinner in New York City on October 23, Senator Paul said:

Our national power is a function of the national economy. During the Reagan renaissance, our strength in the world reflected our successful economy.

Low growth, high unemployment, and big deficits have undercut our influence in the world. Americans have suffered real consequences from a weak economy.

President George W. Bush understood that part of the projection of American power is the exporting of American goods and culture. His administration successfully brokered fourteen new free trade agreements and negotiated three others that are the only new free trade agreements approved since President Obama took office. Instead of just talking about a so-called pivot to Asia, the Obama administration should prioritize negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership by years end.

<TEXT> So what? They are investors. They don't work, they invest their money and it works for them - the are able to finally do this under Obama. 

Of course the children, those in college, jail, etc probably aren't working, and given how racist the justice system is one can better understand the numbers (Note: conservatives don't think the system is racist at all and, in fact, support more discrimination in America against blacks, muslims, gays, etc). 

And don't worry folks - some republican will campaign on forcing those black folks into the labor force...just like, what to cons, were the 'good ole days'. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here is my problem with free trade and conservatives:

Theory - free trade will help poorer countries grow which will open new markets for the US and spur job growth.

Reality - ok, makes sense....but you forgot something.

What happens is businesses close here and people lose jobs as the first step. Then they lose their house, car, etc. And maybe, just maybe in 5-10 years more jobs will open up. All the while conservatives are yelling at people needing food stamps, unemployment, etc and calling them lazy. And, of course, they are busy union busting so when some jobs do come back you won't be making as much as you were before. </TEXT>

5 People, out of the entire population of earth. Now I am sure some might think they can come back and inspire others - but the track record here is the US kills folks like them all the time. 

Maybe the fear people have is that they will use their time and notoriety to influence fundamentalists to jihad - to which I say, I am more worried about the fundies here than there.

Where did the taliban come from? What can these guys actually offer the taliban now? Or is it Al qadea I am supposed to be afraid of now. Or Isis?

Seems there is always someone in the ME that I should be afraid of. I live in Ohio. I am more worried about the Wolverines come football season or the Spartans than some no name guy in the ME who wants to kill someone else in the ME.

Hell, for all I know there some russian guy who pines for the old days and wants to work with some of his comrades to launch a nuke. Really, I am not afraid of 5 guys from the ME who have more of a bone with countries there over Islam than here.

<TEXT> As far as the last part: *How is that relevant to Bergdahl?*

It goes to the worries and concerns the right seems to have. Really. I am not scared of the people we traded for one of our own. What are they going to do to the US? Nothing. They don't scare me. If I had to put my 'worries' in some order or other, those 5 would fall below my X. Countries and people that have the actual ability to do us real harm (China/Russia) would be high up on the list.

This is about one thing - people who hate Obama and want to use this whole thing for political reasons. 

I see a US soldier, who for whatever reason, was captured and in danger. He is home now. That's one bottom line for me in all of this. I was no fan of Bush, though I voted for him in 2000, but I wouldn't have ripped him a new one for bringing home one of our own. Our soldiers face a lot, sometimes they have issues, but you don't leave em behind. Period. 

Maybe 'patriot' means something different to others. One of our own was captive. We had those guys we traded for awhile and got whatever it is we wanted from them. They were no use to us. It isn't like they are gonna rise up and come over here and whip us. Seriously, there are bigger and worse things to be scared of than them.

But it's all about politics and bashing Obama - I can find a lot better things to bash him over than this.

I mean overall, were you one of those people who though Iraq was some huge threat to the US in the first place? 

We traded some losers not from this country for someone who was a US citizen. That is a good trade all day long because I am not really sitting here scared of those folks all day long.

<TEXT> And the right would rather leave a soldier to rot than bring him home.

It is obvious that they have totally abandoned their principles on this - but hey, remember Darren Wilson and Ferguson? They got upset when people judged him before his day in court. Suddenly they don't care anymore.

<TEXT> They can be upset about that all day long. But they would be upset no matter what he did. If he had left him there to rot because someone said he deserted, without proof and chance to defend himself, and it came out he could have rescued him? The right would be screaming about it.

It goes to principles. Should he have treated the man as innocent first? Would you? Or has that principle went out the window because people hate Obama ? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll say what I have elsewhere. Obama acted properly and treated him as innocent until proven guilty.

Something I think conservatives used to believe in but are now ditching because of Obama. Funny how that works. Guess they will from here on out never, ever, mention the idea of innocent until proven guilty.

Had it come out that Obama had the chance and did nothing because he believed he deserted than the right would be howling about that too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So you are saying Obama shouldn't have done anything and just accepted the word of others that he was a deserter, without a tribunal, hearing, etc? Without even talking to him (or having others do so)?

And here I thought conservatives had some principles on people being seen as innocent until proven guilty or at least being able to testify on their own behalf.

I am guessing conservatives are abandoning their principles right now to smear Obama. Which means they never really held those principles in the first place. </TEXT>

"Good. Obama is evil and took all our guns. Bibi should be our president and I support any country spying on us. I hate America because the person I wanted to win didn't so I fully endorse foreign nations spying on us. We must support Israel and stop gays here or we will get more deadly hurricanes. 

We should be more like them and how they treat gays and how they handle health care - not like Obama, we need leader like Bibi to hold us cause we are scared of mooslims too! Not to mention baby Jeebus loves Israel and will curse us if we fail to kneel and serve her, Obama is a muslim and doesn't know what the bible says about us serving them!"

<TEXT> Here are my thoughts. When I was in elementary school we had one jewish kid (and 2 black kids) and I don't know if any were atheist or not. But we did have fun Christmas celebrations and plays. And we also learned about Jewish holidays and did activities with that spinny thing made of clay stuff and some candle thingees....

Anyway. Being exposed to actual, real life, cultures and languages that a good chunk of our fellow earthlings are involved in I don't see as a bad thing. It's one thing to read about something in a book and another to hear it/see/etc.

I mean, which would you rather do - learn about sex from a book or from actually doing it? :)

There can be stories every single day about any other race running into issues because of their race and the right just passes them right on by. They don't claim it is wrong, they don't care one wit. The second a white person runs into some bigotry (or a Christian vs a muslim/hindu/etc) the right suddenly 'cares'.

Then they claim "Look, some others do it as well! So why complain when whites do it? Huh? Go on, explain why my being racist is bad but when someone else does it no one pays attention? It happened once, just look at that high school!"

Yeah...no one takes the right serious on race matters anymore.

<TEXT> Wait, what, really?

Hey, the people behind this (the ambassador) said a lot I agree on when it comes to Iran. 

Look at the evidence. A biased person from a biased source has said something with no proof to back it up. Back it up.

Conservatives are just upset Obama beat them. Twice. So they make up things because everything they have said to date hasn't come to pass. All they have to go on now is hearsay. 

Did Obama, for example, take people's guns away? Nope. But they said he WOULD. Not that he could. That he would. And the right believed that, without any facts, because....well, hell I don't even know why.

Every prediction from the right about Obama has been wrong, but people put them out there as fact because they want to believe.

<TEXT> I think I confuse her in my old age with Loretta Lynn a lot.

Overall: Obama nominated her, she won't serve very long, and I don't see that her impact will be all that much given the scope of the job and the short term she will be serving. If congress approves her and Obama is for her than what I think of her isn't relevant at all to anyone. 

I am pro MJ but short of some national legislation making it legal I don't see her views on it impacting much. It's not like cheech or chong were nominated. If her job is to uphold the law as it is written her views on it all won't matter a lot anyway - though she could divert resources.

You know, honoring deals that were made, etc. You can dig more from there. But I am guessing if Obama didn't release those funds the right would call him a liar, king, etc.

Maybe you could find the actual deal. How it was made, who made it, signed it, etc - that is,  if the issue is something you are actually interested in instead of just an unintelligent attack. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can be understanding here towards cops. They see it as tool to aid them in serving and protecting. I can't blame them for wanting to do their jobs better.

On the other side of the equation is concern about government employees having data that isn't relevant to any particular crime but could be misused many ways. 

Now, given that there are trust issues between citizens and government I can sympathize with the citizens here more than I can with cops (who often have their own trust issues with citizens).

My solution? Set up a framework of standards. From how data is stored to it's retention period. Shorten the normal retention period but allow a longer one - one where after the short term the data is encrypted and requires, essentially, a 'key party' to access it and the signature of a judge. 

After the longer period data is purged and it is certified that data was purged and any data that is used in a criminal case that happens to have not been purged (accident/willfully) will be tainted.

Lastly, make sure there are stiff penalties should these procedures not be followed. Both criminal and civil. </TEXT>

What they would like to see is the child born, hungry and homeless and in this case motherless so they can practice their own brand of Christianity and tell the kid he is a lazy bum, worthless, and no way they will support him/her getting foodstamps or a free lunch at school.

That is hard to do when someone is pregnant, so force them to have the kid so you can belittle them later. Oh, and discourage birth control, health care for the baby and pregnant woman (she should work harder if she wants care - what do you think we are, barbarians like in those other countries where people have single payer???)

We will announce that all gun owners can get a free bible and ammo when they bring their guns to a jesus station to be blessed by a rabbi. And for each gun they bring in to be cleaned, for free, they get a copy of the quran with Obama's face on the cover to burn (we will have a fire going with free smore's and such).

We will also be offering a free entry for each gun to a raffle. Grand prize is a 50 cal machine gun signed by reagan that was used to kill muslims after 9/11. Many won't be able to resist. And when they show up, Obama will personally take their guns (don't tell them, the place is already surrounded by isis folks to protect him).

Here is what the right believes:

All humans can be wealthy
They can all own businesses

Of course, if that were true there would be no one to actually work.

"Look at me! I own a bank...but there is no one to work here, do IT, cash checks, etc"

Or "I own this large freighter and can pilot it and maintain it myself, and load it!"

Basically, they live in a fantasy world where workers aren't needed and hence have no rights.

Somehow, someway, I think maybe they think god and his angels will just do the actual work because they don't actually believe anyone has to work for anyone else, ever, anywhere. And if they do it is just because they aren't smart enough to own their own company.  </TEXT>

Now, let's go back to the 9/11 investigation. How do we know everything was released? We don't. You never can. By the rw logic that investigation should still be going on today (at least until we can get the results some want).

She turned them over and gowdy is now saying he doesn't believe the state dept turned over all of the benghazi ones and doesn't trust them to. So he wants them all to see for himself. So now he is accusing the state department of lying (which I am guessing would be a criminal act - but they aren't launching a criminal probe are they?)

Can any conservatives here tell us what they think they will find? That she caused it, let it happen, stand down orders, etc (all of which have been handled already)?

What they want is dirt ahead of 2016.

They have investigated benghazi more than 9/11/2001....why? </TEXT>

No one should be surprised that dictators like Assad would cross the Presidents red line because he knows the President wont even defend the line that separates our nation from Mexico.*

Let's just get down to the brass tacks here. Under Obama we have deported more people and defended our border better than bush did. But let's not even bother with that.

What is Perry really trying to say here? That Assad sits around reading immigration reports from the US? Really? Is Perry that stupid? But OK, maybe Assad has nothing better to do.

So now we have Assad reading immigration reports and coming to the conclusion that Obama won't do anything about anything he does. Which is still silly. 

BUT maybe, just maybe.....

Assad sees how the right tries to stop anything Obama wants to do by yelling "He didn't get our approval first!" and realizes that if he does anything Obama won't be able to act because republicans will get in the way because they care more about politics than the country.

If I were Assad I would act more on that than anything else - divide America because you know one party will stand in the way no matter what.

*ast month, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich became the first high-profile conservative to champion one of the most extreme environmental positions in recent memory: total elimination of the EPA.*

So, okay, the stock market is up under obama, and was down under bush - great, we agree on that. 

Now, google 2008 obama will crash stock market. You will find such gems as:

Warning: Stocks Will Collapse by 50%

*Faber doesnt hesitate to put the blame squarely on President Obamas big-government policies and the Federal Reserves risky low-rate policies, which, he says, penalize the income earners, the savers who save, your parents  why should your parents be forced to speculate in stocks and in real estate and everything under the sun?

Billion-dollar investor Warren Buffett is rumored to be preparing for a crash as well. The Warren Buffett Indicator, also known as the Total Market Cap to GDP Ratio, is breaching sell-alert status and a collapse may happen at any moment. *

The right wing is a little butt hurt all the bad things they said would happen didn't. Jobs grew, the stock market soared, we didn't all die from ebola, people can still buy guns.

And here they are in 2015 still predicting doom and gloom like some cheap 900 line psychics. </TEXT>

Later that same day: "We won't extend UE benefits because there are plenty of jobs and people getting UE are just too lazy to get jobs"

So there are plenty of jobs according to them, but then there aren't....as usual, they make little sense. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First: No conspiracy is being claimed by me about 9/11. But an attack of that magnitude certainly warrants more investigations into it than the 2012 one.

Second: The right is simply milking this to fuel their outrage. Republicans don't even have to have a stand on issues these days because they just rely on people buying into everything about Obama and scaring them into voting.

If you want to destroy faith in the system just look at bush. Stock market less than when he came into office, job loses, housing market, failed wars, etc - and NOW the right us upset and whining? Yeah. A tad selective don't you think? </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, I don't recall claiming that. What I am saying is people are making a mountain out of a mole hill because what some people said during an ongoing issue isn't what they desired to hear.

And now they want to punish someone for not running about yelling terrorism because it denied them the ability to use the deaths right away to denigrate an entire religion based on what some conservative faction of that religion's followers did. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Correction - they suspected. First off, just because some terrorist group claims something doesn't mean you believe them - they could be looking for street cred. 

Second - even if it was the tape could be a trigger event or the reason a group claimed it did it (look at claims made the folks beheading people, they list causes).

So, play it safe until you can prove otherwise and don't give credit out willy nilly.

Oh, and that group that claimed it did it?

Members of Ansar al-Sharia have regularly taken part in protests in Tunisia against perceived blasphemy and have been suspected in involvement in a number of violent incidents.

So, they claimed they did it, they have a history of violent attacks due to blasphemy.... </TEXT>

<TEXT> They will probably try to tie them to Benghazi somehow. 

Also, from the article:
*Rep. Jason Chaffetz, Utah Republican and Oversight Committee chairman, said the ongoing investigations undercut President Obamas assertion last year that there was no evidence of corruption in the IRSs targeting.

I have no idea how the president came to such a definitive conclusion without all the facts, he said.*

And ya know, I don't know how the right has come to the conclusions they have either about it all without all the facts, but there they are - republicans running around saying they know what happened. Weird. So maybe all those blabbering on about it should say "We don't really know anything because we don't have all the facts." instead of the gotcha headlines and such about Obama targeting them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Armor piercing ammunition

18 U.S.C.,  921(a)(17)(B)


    A projectile or projectile core which may be used in a handgun and which is constructed entirely (excluding the presence of traces of other substances) from one or a combination of tungsten alloys, steel, iron, brass, bronze, beryllium copper, or depleted uranium; or

     
    A full jacketed projectile larger than .22 caliber designed and intended for use in a handgun and whose jacket has a weight of more than 25 percent of the total weight of the projectile.


The term armor piercing ammunition does not include shotgun shot required by Federal or State environmental or game regulations for hunting purposes, a frangible projectile designed for target shooting, a projectile which the Attorney General finds is primarily intended to be used for sporting purposes, or any other projectile or projectile core which the Attorney General finds is intended to be used for industrial purposes, including a charge used in an oil and gas well perforating device.


----

The ATF isn't extending, it is interpreting based on existing law what fits into the law. Your link has a link in it to the PDF of the technical reasons laid out as to why they are suggesting the change and I am guessing they are required to allot time for the public to comment on it - so letting the comment period last '5 minutes' would have been a wrong move for them.

Further, in the PDF, you will note that they have been getting a lot more requests, since 2011, for exemptions to the rule - hence their desire to clarify the rule and make it more simple in it's application. Again - this is a proposal which is open for comment on their ideals. 

This reminds me of when there was proposal about kids doing some work on farms and there was a proposal period open for discussion on restricting certain things. The right waited till the comment period was about up and then railed on it claiming Obama was going to forbid kids from helping out on the farm. 

[Barack Obama proposed banning farm kids from doing basic chores, John Thune said](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/29/john-thune/barack-obama-proposed-banning-farm-kids-doing-basi/) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let me help you here: "sounds like it came from" and "because the facts aren't what they claim." go together in a sense. When someone wants to detract from the facts (because they aren't as bad/motivated for x reason) they use a headline to plant a suggestion. 

In this case, in the article it is noted: "The proposal by the A.T.F. to reclassify the rifle ammunition started more than three years ago" and it is also noted: "This is an A.T.F. proposal being considered through its standard process, an official there said. "

The attempt by the right the last few days has been to associate Obama himself with this to prop up their failed propaganda in 2008 that Obama would ban all guns. So.....any chance they get they make sure "Obama" appears in the headline.

They also don't mention the 1986 law reagan signed and how this is somewhat of an extension of the definitions listed there to keep the law updated and relevant based on it's stated goals.

Overall - some poor journalism and a story being used by the right to whip up their base. I would have more respect if it was simply written as "Here is an ATF proposal, this is comment period, here is the history of it all, if you oppose it let them know" </TEXT>

<TEXT> The criteria is whether you could perform the job if you had it, not whether or not you have a job. Your "past relevant work" is defined as any work you performed on a substantial basis during the past 15 years. The Analyst will assess your Residual Functional Capacity (RFC), which indicates what functions you are able to perform despite your disability. You will be classified as to whether you are capable of doing sedentary, light, medium, heavy, or very heavy work. Your RFC will then be compared to the requirements of your past jobs. This is why it is very important to list all of the physical and mental requirements of jobs on your Work History that you are no longer able to perform.

<TEXT> *To meet our definition of disability, you must not be able to engage in any substantial gainful activity (SGA) because of a medically-determinable physical or mental impairment(s):*

Low earnings, however, don't necessarily establish that you're unable to work. The SSA will consider the circumstances under which work was performed. For example, where a disability applicant had worked as a substitute bus driver, the court found that he was doing SGA because his low earnings did not indicate that he was unable to work and his income was less than it could be because of the on-call nature of the job. The SSA can even consider volunteer activities and criminal activities as SGA if they represent substantial work for which someone would ordiniarily be paid (the agency will not consider hobbies or school attendance to be SGA).

Similarly, high earnings don't necessarily the claimant was doing SGA, if he or she was working under special conditions. Claimants can argue that their income would have been lower but for the fact that the claimant:

People often picture disabled people are being unable to do much of anything, then see them cutting the grass and yell AHA! Cheater! You are doing work! Without understanding the legal definitions of disability. A mental illness is another example. Your meds can have terrible side effects that leave you in bed most of the day for days, then you are a little better and can do more - but you lack consistency to gain employment (again, people won't see you laying in bed sick in your house,but step outside to shovel your walk and they will think you can hold down a full time job). </TEXT>

The problems with the fund have known about for last two decades and congress has been too lazy to fix it - the right will claim the problem is from lazy moochers/etc and not congress screwing around. And it will play with their base who don't understand what ssdi actually is (ever hear one say "I know someone on ssdi, he can work!"? They always fail to understand how the term disability is applied and you ability to do what you were doing, etc).
