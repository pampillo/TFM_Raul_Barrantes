<TITLE> 5 Things Productive People Do Each Day </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-06 15:56:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Source](http://www.azsmartoffice.com/articles/2015/top-5-things-productive-people-do-each-day)

We all want to get more things done in less time. With all the distractions we have each day that is an increasingly more difficult aspect of our careers to work on. After having a couple kids and taking on more work than ever before, here are the top 5 things I do each day to ensure maximum productivity and minimum insanity.

##1. Stick to a Sleep Schedule
We all know that sleep is important, but if you don't believe me you can see what the [Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/sleep/art-20048379) has to say about sleep. Make sure you are setting a sleep schedule and sticking to it to ensure you are getting the right amount. Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day. That means weekends and holidays too. Many experts agree that [consistency is important](http://www.inc.com/eric-v-holtzclaw/consistency-power-success-rules.html), so make sure you are being consistent with your sleep habits. Being consistent reinforces your body's sleep-wake cycle and helps promote better sleep at night. 

##2. Pay Attention to Your Diet
You literally are what you eat. food is fuel, and the kinds of foods and drinks you consume determine the types of nutrients in your system and impact how well your mind and body are able to function. That sugar and caffeine filled can might give you a quick short boost of energy, but is 15 minutes all the time you need? Try drinking a large glass of water first and see if that helps you feel better and wake up. [A symptom of dehydration is tiredness](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dehydration/basics/symptoms/con-20030056).

##3. Focus Your Mind
Meditation is not a luxury like a reflexology foot massage. Its a way to disconnect from everyday stresses, if only for a few minutes a day. You deserve to feel good, to have the energy you want to enjoy life, to be healthy and happy. Start living the life you were meant to live. Learn to meditate.  Dr. Marcia Hootman

There are [many benefits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_on_meditation) that come when you take the time to practice some sort of meditation, from increased focus to more happieness. It is understandable to be afraid of somethign you haven't tried before, especially something as personal as meditation. Being quiet and alone with yourself can be scary, it's one of the reasons why our society is so obsessed with technology, entertainment and distractions. We are afraid of our true selves. Once you are able to build up the will power to overcome that fear you will put yourself on a path to greater mental focus and productivity.

Reddit has many great resources like r/mindfulness and r/meditation if you want to learn more.

##4. Set Goals

By [setting goals](http://www.codeofliving.com/articles/5-powerful-reasons-why-goal-setting-important) we give ourselves focus and a way to measure our progress during the day. Having daily goals is a great way to remain undistracted, help us overcome procrastination and motivate us to succeed.

Goals are what take us forward in life; they are the oxygen to our dreams. They are the first steps to every journey we take and are also our last. Its very important that you realize the significance and importance of goal-setting and apply this knowledge in your life."

##5. Make Email More Productive
Ever been overwhelmed by emails at work? Experts report billions of emails are sent every day and they're still increasing. With so many messages arriving throughout the day, email can easily become a continual interruption and distraction from getting real work accomplished. Try some useful tips like scheduling time for email and only working on them during that specified time, use the subject line only for quick messages, and replace large Word and PowerPoint file attachments with PDFs.

Our work and our lives are better when we are more productive, less stressed and able to use our time more effectively. By setting a consistent sleep schedule, maintaining a healthy diet, exploring meditation and your own mind, taking the time to set and track goals and finding better ways to manage your email you will be on a path to a more productive life. I'm not saying that these things won't take practice and some work on your part, but the reward is well worth the effort involved. </TEXT>

There are lots of fun things to learn to be good at SEO. Skills like research, strategizing, writing, reputation management, networking, web design and more. The sidebar of this subreddit has lots of great resources. Moz has a ton of great stuff on their blog as does searchengineland. 

The benefits of hiring a professional are the same as with any job or task. If you hire someone who knows what they are doing, who will create a marketing strategy for you with a way to measure results and tweak your plan, you will hit the ground running and benefit from the professional's many years of experience and expertise.  </TEXT>

You know when you're going to have a tough day, and remembering not to beat yourself up about it is so important. It's tough having a growth mindset all the time, thanks for the reminder :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Being a designer is pretty awesome. In the last three years, my professional activities as characterized by type of design are:

 * Content Design (content strategy, content marketing, etc)
 * Game Design
 * Graphic Design
 * Illustration
 * Industrial Design
 * Information Design (content audits, site maps, mock-ups, etc)
 * Media Design
 * Motion Design
 * Packaging Design
 * Product Design
 * Software Design (wireframing, user-centered design, etc)
 * Usability Design
 * User-Centered Design
 * User Experience Design (rapid prototyping, user flows, user scenarios, etc)
 * User Interface Design (user interaction, user-centric, etc)
 * Web Design (responsive web, typography, etc)

One of my favorite things about being a designer is the amount of new things there are to learn and old things there are to get better at. The best advice I can give is probably the same advice you can get for almost any career path, that is to never stop learning. 

As for getting work for your portfolio just make stuff. Do you have an idea you think would make a good app? Mock up some UI designs or some user flow charts. Interview a dozen people about a problem you think you can design a solution for and create a list of user needs, then go prototype out some solutions. You don't have to do client work to get a portfolio :)

Lastly it helps if you spend some free time honing your craft. Drawing every day really helps with so many aspects of the job for example.

If you ever have any random questions [feel free to contact me](https://twitter.com/ryanallen_com), and good luck :) </TEXT>

I still try to do the things I wrote about all the time, so I don't think I'm being disingenuous. There are times when I'm required to critique things (UI mockups from the design team for example) and in those situations I do need to look for things that I view as wrong. By practicing what I wrote about however I've trained myself not to **only** look for the things that are wrong. </TEXT>

I worked on this for a while until I was in control over my own emotions to the point where I knew when I was right in thinking something had fault, as opposed to being defensive and reactionary. Initially though I had a set of thought patterns that I realized I needed to work on. What I found is that even if there is an idea that I don't agree with, that I have reason to criticize, I am now able to find some points that I do agree on. Most of the time anyway :) The times when I can't find a single thing to agree on I can at least agree that the person conveying the ideas is trying and putting in the work to convey their ideas, which is in itself a very positive thing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> * Do not criticize, condemn or complain, this begins with your thoughts.  
* Practice patience, in all things.  
* Practice empathy, with everyone.  
* Be honest to yourself and then with others.  

These are the main things I try to work on and remember every day. I wrote my thoughts down a few years ago and finally got the nerve to [publish them](https://medium.com/@ryanallen_com/become-a-better-designer-and-person-by-learning-to-listen-f23ef9bef9b2).

---

#Become a Better INSERT JOB TITLE HERE and Person by Learning to Listen  

Patient, honest, empathetic, and non-judgemental thoughts will have an incredibley profound impact on your career, your relationships and your overall well-being.

There is no single act or idea that can fix all of your problems. There are acts and ideas that can pivot you into new, and passion-filled life adventures however. This could very well be one of those ideas, if only you act.

Consider how becoming a better listener will help you become a better designer, instead of the designer who argues with everyone and is difficult to work with. Consider how the seemingly simple act of practicing patient, non-judgemental, and engaged listenting will help you become more well-liked, focused, and more aware of frivolous abstractions in an effort to find and move closer to your true self.

How can you do this?

##Admit When You Are Wrong

To listen with patience and acceptance requires an inner strength to notice your fears and understand where they are coming from, while at the same time actively listening to and engaging, but not interrupting, the speaker. You need to practice and develop the courage to listen with an open mind to other peoples ideas, while also realizing your own ideas may be wrong. To achieve honesty with yourself you must begin by [not criticizing, condemning, or complaining](http://dalecarnegieboston.tumblr.com/post/20350676146/dont-criticize-condemn-or-complain) both externally and internally.

To listen without patience, acceptance, and an honest open mind, results in a tenacity and stubborn resistance to change, with an unwillingness to acknowledge defeat not only to the speaker, but to yourself. This fear is born from your unwillingness to practice courageous mental strength, honesty, and empathy, and prevents you from being flexible in many situations and unable to empathize and grow as a person both personally and professionally.

##Building a Foundation Based on Empathy, Patience and Honesty

In order to cultivate an empathetic, patient, and fearless open mind, you must begin with empathy. In order to sound honest, patient, and sincere you must be and act honest, patient, and sincere. It helps many people to pretend, make-believe, or act. Eventually it becomes an honest part of you. You will slowly find yourself not having to act, you will just be.

"Im curious about other people. Thats the essence of my acting. Im interested in what it would be like to be you." Meryl Streep

Only when you are able to become more aware and actively use and control your own emotions, will you be able to develop a deep sense of collaboration and respect for your speaker, even if you never fully accept their ideas as your own.

##Be Honest With Yourself

Before you can become a better person you must practice patient listening. Before becoming a patient listener you must focus on actively accepting the speakers ideas, philosophies, and words by actively practicing empathy with everyone you can remember to practice it with.

What is empathy? You can only begin to understand and actively practice empathy with others by accepting their words, ideas, and ultimately their true being. To do this you must first acknowledge, understand, and then accept your own true being. You must believe in yourself before you are able to accept belief from others. You must believe in the value of your own words, ideas, and feelings before you can believe in another persons feelings, ideas, and words.

You must begin to take ownership of your own actions and admit to your failings. Failures are how you learn.

"Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they cant lose.[Bill Gates](https://twitter.com/billgates)

By admitting to your shortcomings and fully owning your actions you will begin to build the solid foundation that is the new you. The better you. The patient, accepting, and wise you.

##When Two Become One

I told you that you have the potential to become a better person by becoming a better listener, but I havent yet told you how. The answer to that isnt one you will understand by the end of this article. It is an answer that will take a lifetime of practiced social interractions to truly make itself known to you. Interractions where you and your partner, even if just for a few fleeting moments, merge into a singular abstract personality where an almost complete understanding is shared between you.

This understanding takes place in almost every conversation we have. It is a fundamental process in love, patience, and a bettering of our very human nature. Sometimes we are just so intensely interested in our own thoughts that we fail to notice. In summation, remember:

* Do not criticize, condemn or complain, this begins with your thoughts.  
* Practice patience, in all things.  
* Practice empathy, with everyone.  
* Be honest to yourself and then with others

The more people you offer your services to the better chance you have of picking up new clients. Half of my day consists of networking, giving presentations, free work for charities etc. Everything I can to sell my services. 

Price isn't an issue once I sell someone on the work I can do, though I don't sell anything based on price. I've found the clients that are extremely price conscious only care about that one thing, which results in the product and my sanity suffering. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So in a case where content remains the same but the presentation to the user changes. 

How would your naming change if it was the presentation that remained the same but the content changed?

So for example:

On a portrait phone the container is 100% of the viewport's width and height and an image is displayed. 

On a landscape phone the same container is 100% of the viewport and a different image is displayed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the only rules in advertising are that you can't tell an outright lie. Otherwise advertisers can pump out whatever paying consumers are willing to be influenced by. All religions advertise, some are just better about using the right sort of media to reach an audience.

My assumption, based on no research what-so-ever, is that a large part of football loving american families are christian to some degree. It is probably easier to convince someone who believes in one religion to switch if they are 'losing faith', than it is to convince someone who has no belief system to suddenly get one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been working in it for a long time now, but there are some quirks that drive me bonkers. Snapping is a big one. Nothing EVER snaps correctly in illustrator. Whether that is because I am not using settings correctly (enable pixel grid, snap to point, snap to grid, sub snap settings like snap to selection or snap to art board omg) or Illustrator has just had awful snap detection I do not know. I suspect it is just illustrator trying to make me angry.

Regardless of some of the crazy things about Illustrator it really is a powerful piece of software and allows me (and other much more talented artists) to do really neat work.

There are an almost unlimited amount of free tutorials out there on youtube and artists' websites for you to learn. I just recently read Vector Basic Training by Von Glitschka and it was excellent. It has a lot of basic stuff in it and he does a good job of explaining how and why he does certain things. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I use so many keys I actually got a 2nd bluetooth keyboard that I use on [top of my wacoms](http://instagram.com/p/ZWDCftlPBs).

I had a medium intuos I just recently sold because I found I was using my small one (in addition to the cintiq) and never the medium one. I had bought the small one at first to work while traveling and found that it was really all I needed. I think I may tend to draw small anyway in my moleskines though, so it really is a preference thing I think.

The nice thing about most retailers now is they take returns on hardware for at least 7 days, and in some cases (like amazon) up to a month after purchase. Try one out and if you don't like it swap it for a different one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wacom recently rebranded the bamboo to intuos, and the intuos to intuos pro. When the bamboo first came out it had driver issues and was very unresponsive and I couldn't recommend it to anyone. I have not tried the newer versions but they may be much better. If you have less than $100 you may want to try one of those. Maybe get one on amazon and if you don't like it send it back.

If you have $250 to spend the small intuos pro is amazing. I have a 24" cintiq touch I use every day and I still use my small intuos pro several times a week. The intuos is super responsive and has almost no lag (compared to my cintiq which has some lag when I'm doing quick sketches.) If my intuos were to break I would immediately get another one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Every couple of months I find a unique style in something that catches my eye, whether it's a form of illustration, design style, painting style etc, and I copy the style incorporating my own content into it. I don't ever do it for clients or for money, it is mostly just to learn and practice something new (or something I haven't done in a while.)

An example right now is isometric pixel art. I actually have a client that wants this form of illustration for a project, and I have done it before, but I'm out of practice. Right now I plan on doing a few illustrations just for personal practice before jumping fully into the project.

I like browsing behance and dribbble for styles that I have no clue how to do, and I try to copy it as closely as possible. After I feel like I have a better understanding of the style I then try to make my own content in the same style.

It's not really a design challenge that other people ever see, it's more just for myself, but it works well for me :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not the best at getting my thoughts written down. I thought I made the point that if you have been designing for a while it is part of the natural progression of things, or at least it seems that way for me.

A huge portion of my job recently when developing apps or websites is the UX end of things, and it naturally lead to choosing to do that full time as opposed to just doing it along with developing the UI and actually building it all (html, javascript, Xcode etc).

If your job already has you doing these things, and you enjoy that end of it, then you should consider doing it full time as it is a good way to step into a higher position and make more money. I should have been more clear on that point. I didn't mean to come across as saying you should do UX only for the money, as in my experience that is one of the last reasons to do work. I think I actually had an entire section about doing work you enjoy but my friend who read through the article told my I had too many tangents :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I went from an Intuos3 to a cintiq and I'm happy with the switch. The intuos is a bit faster and more responsive, but I only have a 21UX. I imagine the new 24hd and 24hd touch are better.

I still love drawing on the screen more than on the intuos, but as you said the price jump is pretty significant. </TEXT>

Restart everything and flush your cache by opening terminal and type dscacheutil -flushcache

<TEXT> For reproduction you are probably best going with something like blurb or lulu. Here is an example of an artbook project I just finished with a bunch of other artists. Granted this one was all digital work submitted to me in an approved template, but you can see the final pdf's, images of the printed work from blurb and how it is setup for sale (no profits are made on this).
