<TEXT> Most episodes take place in California, but why is this? I understand that the studio is located in San Francisco, but why not expand out and record episodes elsewhere? There are a wide-range of myths scattered about the U.S. in relation to a specific area and it would make the story that much more interesting if the myth could be proven or debunked in the exact location where it was said to have taken place.

<TEXT> Pros: knowing that you're changing to something that works.

Cons: complete utter hell. I spent a few weeks gradually weaning off of Cymbalta, even though my doctor was against it. I wanted to change medications and it was my only option. I experienced horrible mood swings, I would want to scream and throw things (I had a tendency of doing this before taking antidepressants), my body felt numb, I couldn't eat, all I wanted to do was sleep, and is something I hope I never have to go through again.


This may not be the same thing experienced by other people, but weaning of an antidepressant such as Cymbalta has it's downsides. BUT it is definitely worth it if you are changing to something that works.

I am currently on a medication that works and doesn't interfere with my anxiety meds. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well at least everyone will know where to find the command centers.

I would just like to put it out there that they know we expect an attack on the 4th..meaning that they'll want to hit us off-guard and NOT attack on the 4th. Especially if they know we are prepared.

Also, enough with the scare tactics. People are paranoid as is, try not to make it worse. Best thing to do would be to not publicize what the FBI plans to do and just do it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In case there is a pay wall,

The Senate joined the House by approving a session-ending bill Friday making adjustments to legislation imposing a state tax increase of $432 million next year that constitutes the largest in Kansas history.

Public begging and private bullying that defined the session's votes on tax policy prompted adoption by the bare minimum -- 21 votes in the Senate, 63 in the House -- of legislation  endorsed by Gov. Sam Brownback and designed to respond to a projected $400 million deficit in the fiscal year starting July 1.

The House came up with a slightly different mix of tax additions than was passed Sunday by the Senate, which required the upper chamber to vote on a bill matching the House action. That bill was in peril on Friday afternoon until Sen. Rob Olson, R-Olathe, changed his vote to "yes" and provided the ending margin.

In recent days, heavy political muscle was applied to GOP lawmakers to vote for a tax increase or face a primary election opponent in August 2016.  The Brownback administration also triggered a public backlash by declaring failure to raise taxes could result in sweeping budget reductions in Kansas higher education.

The battle to frame the tax increase in a politically palatable way erupted on the Senate and House floors.

"I view this as tax reform, not a tax hike," said Sen. Julia Lynn, an Olathe Republican who voted for the measure.

Sen. Jeff Longbine, R-Emporia, said the tax package was deficient in many ways but voted for the legislation because it might not improve if the session was prolonged. He denounced tactics used to persuade legislators to vote for revenue enhancements.

"We've had blackmail from the executive branch to the legislative branch," he said. "We've had blackmail within this body."

Brownback, in a meeting Thursday with Republicans in the House and Senate, said he was desperate to make a deal.

"I'm pleading with you, really," he said.

That GOP gathering helped inspire passage by the House of a two bills revising tax law, but likely requiring Brownback to take a knife to state spending in the next fiscal year. The chamber slipped over the hurdle around 4 a.m. Friday after hard-core conservatives who had stiff-armed leadership and the governor for weeks folded.

"Colleagues, weve had a long session, but our diligence has paid off and were making an additional $50 million in cuts to the budget," said Rep. Steve Brunk, R-Wichita. "Our goal is to enact a long-term stable and predictable revenue source to provide necessary services while protecting taxpayers pocketbooks. This bill accomplishes that.

Though dozens of Republicans ended up voting to raises taxes -- some in violation of anti-tax pledges -- some couldn't hide their displeasure.

Rep. John Whitmer, a Wichita Republican, spoke through tears as he explained his "yes" vote.

"I voted for something I am not proud of," Whitmer said, "but I feel it's what the folks need."

The legislation retained a business tax exemption Brownback delivered to 330,000 businesses in 2012, but raised the statewide sales tax to 6.5 percent from 6.15 percent on all purchases. A provision dropping the sales tax on food to 5.95  percent was withdrawn by Republicans who want to consider that adjustment in advance of the 2016 elections for House and Senate.

"It gives us the highest sales tax rate on food in the nation. Low-income people will be paying the highest rate in the nation," said Senate Minority Leader Anthony Hensley, D-Topeka. "Brownback's tax policy is Robin Hood in reverse. He steals from the poor to benefit the rich."

House Minority Leader Tom Burroughs, D-Kansas City, said Republicans were dedicated to adding $164 million to the sales tax, wiping out $97 million in itemized deductions and boosting the cigarette tax by $40 million.

"We are literally increasing the cost of living in Kansas on those who can afford it least," Burroughs said.

The plan would freeze state income tax rates at 2.7 percent and 4.6 percent through 2017, which saves the state $26  million. The deal also dropped language requiring all Kansas sales tax exemptions to expire in four years.

The session has consumed 113 days -- longest in state history and well beyond the standard 90-day session.

The break in House gridlock followed warnings by the Brownback administration that savage cuts would be made in the state university system and the state's bond ratings would collapse absent a compromise about Republicans.

Brownback and the GOP-controlled House and Senate struggled to respond to a budget deficit that trailed approval of the elimination of state income tax on limited liability companies and other businesses as well as the reduction of individual income tax rates. The bill contains a $24 million hit on these business entities, but the presumption is savvy accountants could help most owners avoid the hit.

The higher sales tax would be implemented July 1, but businesses wouldn't be obligated to assess that rate for 30 days. That could clip the state for one month of the projected revenue increase from the sales tax by $13 million.

The legislation also depends on the Kansas Department of Revenue pulling in $30 million this fall with a tax amnesty program for people who have dodge taxes.

The two bills now in play with the House and Senate would raise $384.6 million annually for the state, but a separate piece of legislation sent to Brownback would deliver $47.8 million from a new tax on managed care organizations in Kansas. </TEXT>

If it the action that the state of KS has taken is considered invalid, what makes those states think they can do the same thing?

Also, what federal law does this go against? (I'm not much of a history buff)

<TEXT> Fellow Pinckney resident here! 

A few shady homes and loud neighbors, but all and all, a great neighborhood. 

Best bet in finding a place would be to drive around the area and see what is for rent. There are a few apartment complexes - two of which are owned by the same family - and they are always an option if a home is not available.

When assigned reading material, we switch off by reading aloud to him and then he'll read a paragraph or two...that requires almost a weeks work and he often still can't comprehend what was read unless we create a graph, table, ect. so that he can make sense of all of the information. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are several different SPED departments and I work with students who are Emotionally Disturbed. These students range from having Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD), Bipolar Disorder, ADHD, a student's father was schizophrenic and the student is quite paranoid and often lashes out, others have Autism (yes, it's real autism, not what people 'think is autism'), and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. 

The kids need our help and would not make it through school without it. 

The students I work with are freshman and most are in intermediate classes. They need extra help when it comes to Geometry, Biology and Civics. Also, that's why I challenged my student. I knew he could do it and did not need to accept the teachers accommodation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My English teacher during my senior year of high school was one of the coolest people I've known. He was open to ideas and encouraged creativity, no matter how crazy it might have seemed. 

He only had one flaw, he would return papers weeks, if not even months, after they had been turned in. We wrote a long paper at the beginning of the second semester (January/February) and did not get them back until the night of graduation.

Ran in to him at a party a few years back. He had moved to the same college town to get his Masters. Found out that the reason it took him so long to return papers and have everything graded was due to the fact he had severe depression and teaching was the only thing that kept him going.

He's now married and has a wonderful life doing what he loves.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My health. Being dizzy makes being productive extremely difficult. As so I'm left feeling pessimistic on a daily basis. I lost my job last week, so that hasn't helped much, and it was due to being dizzy. I hope to go back to school in the fall, but I have spent the past week trying to get ahold of the admissions office and the administrator for the school, and so far nothing. 

My job was working as a SPED Paraeducator at an elementary school. My dream job is to work as an Art Therapist helping children and adolescents.

Shitty health + losing job because of health + awaiting an important phone call = a shitty time

<TEXT> Had that happen last week. Worked at an elementary school as a SPED Paraeducator. Every Wednesday we had a collaborative meeting from 13:15-14:30. Right after it was over, I went out in to the hallway and waited for the teachers I usually helped after school - worked until 15:30. 

My boss walks up to me and tells me that we need to go to the Principal's office to discuss the SPED department. Arrive at his office to see that it was just the three of us.

After the meeting ended, I continued to do my job as usual and helped the teachers as I had every day up to that point. One started to cry when she found out I was leaving. I really loved that job and miss working with the kids.

I was fired because of health reasons. I knew working the position might not pan out too well, so I decided to get the job through a temp agency. I have these wonderful things called inner ear disorders. Last semester was great because I was split between every grade. I ended up getting sick during the first week back and missed two days of work. My schedule had me working with a 3rd grade student most of the day, and when I wasn't with her, I spent my time with a kindergarten class. Those times included recess (of which all were indoor that week) and their 'choice time', which is like recess, but the noise level is 100x worse.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The afternoon of May 31st, 1990 I was walking with my babysitter. A teenage driver took her eyes off of the road and hit what she thought was a bump in the road. I was drug 20ft down a dirt road. Resulted in physical and mental impairments. Went from being a cheerful 3year old to someone completely different. Plus I looked...well not normal. People are mean and were mean throughout my childhood and early adult life. I under went 2-3 dozen facial reconstructive surgeries from the age of four until I turned 17. I'll need more in the future for structural reasons. 

Everyone in my family is quite intelligent, except for me. Reasons for that are due in part to the head trauma. I'm not dumb by any means but I'm stuck with limitations that make it difficult to get to where I would like to be. 

My life is great now, but only because I met people who actually cared enough to get to know me. I have two mottos to life: "Be who you are, not what's cool" - Chef from South Park's episode 'South Park is Gay'; and "I've lived a life no one can relate and few will understand."

<TEXT> My health went to shit back in 2008 and I have had inner-ear problems since then. Over the course of several years I lost hope of ever feeling better and stopped doing most things I enjoyed. Now I'm substantially better because I know how to control the problem (took all but 5 years), but I'm afraid to return to what I once loved. I do not want to have to relearn something that once came to me naturally. I also can't run without feeling sick. Running always helped me relieve stress. It hasn't been an option for several years now.

One student in particular was a brainiac when it came to the subject and seemed to have really enjoyed the subject. Their class had a end of the year celebration on the last day of school and parents were welcome to attend. She played off like she didn't understand the same work she had just completed when her dad asker her about a problem. When I commented on this, her father said she often did this around him. I was left speechless and completely mystified as to why she did this. She has a younger sister in 3rd grade and I often wonder if her sister does the same thing.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Jazzhaus is supposedly haunted, but nothing happens until after it closes to the public. 

I knew a few bartenders and they often shared this. I asked to go upstairs and wait for a ride, but they said it was not allowed due to the 'ghost'. 

A room at The Eldridge is said to be haunted, if not a majority of the rooms on the 5th floor.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> How does that have to do with competencies? The job I hope to be certified for has nothing to do with working on a computer and in a timely fashion. 

Let me explain myself a little bit more....

I am in the process of obtaining a masters in clinical psychology AND art therapy. My dream job is to provide aid to those who struggle through life by showing them the powers of art - through various mediums. 

Why should I be judged for taking the test format you feel is necessary when it has nothing to do with my desired career? 

People are often left with debilitating circumstances in their lives and deserve to be granted the same opportunities as the able bodied. I didn't ask to receive a TBI as a child and should not be held back by limitations granted through the testing procedures that you find are necessary; when I can qualify for testing that fits my needs. </TEXT>

If that is not allowed for the GED, then the system will reach a whole new level of screwing people over who wish to better their lives.

Try it sometime, you may be surprised of what you can learn, and further understand, just by watching the show. 

The Simpsons did something like this during their first few seasons. I have yet to figure out why they stopped. Either way, I lost interest in the show.

<TEXT> I have used this vet since moving to Lawrence nearly a decade ago.  Even though there are a wide range of veterinarians in the Lawrence area, CPAH is the only location in town that grooms cats. 

I agree with /u/SmirkingRevenge that they are somewhat pricey, but it is well worth the few extra bucks. I have never been dissatisfied and they have a very knowledgeable staff. Unlike vets I have gone to in the past, they will actually explain everything to you and let you know the best options for your pet, instead of trying to sell you things your pet does not need.

<TEXT> I was not sure if I should write it with just my approach, or to include my brothers in finding out. I will go ahead and make everything singular. I am more concerned about my own finding out, not my brothers. 

Should I remove that sentence from the first paragraph and leave it as is, without adding more information - my name and finding out? I'll definitely continue with the 'wanting to meet you' at the end of the letter. Also requesting a reply is a better way to approach the subject.

Going too far in-depth with the 23andMe is too much? He's in his early-to-late 70s and I am uncertain whether or not he's that tech savvy, and would have any idea what I was referring to. 

Thank you so much for your advice, I truly appreciate it!  </TEXT>

Nah, I'm rather well. Frustrated of the fact I procrastinated on buying a case, but that's what I get. The only downside is the fact I can't text my best-friend. Emailing will work for now, but texting is a lot easier...plus sending pictures is way easier than using my DSLR, uploading the pictures, and sending. 

I spend less time reading Digg posts and whatever I come across on reddit. Plus I've spent a lot of my time reading about my favorite subject - art therapy. All in all, the separation was for the better. Everything might change once I have it back.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The answer is yes, but more so no. 

Via a close-friend who is a former Orthodox Jew. 

Shmuley Boteach is such a schmuck. He just wants to sell Orthodox Judaism in a way that looks hip and cool and to make Orthodox Judaism seem less like...Orthodox Judaism. What he doesn't say is that you have to ritually wash your hands before and after sex, the man has to recite certain psalms before entering the woman, and that it is *best* to be covered with a sheet or blanket, which means that you kind of have to do it in missionary otherwise a sheet will slip off, and why would you do it a different way if you could do it the *better* way? The man also has to wear his kippah during sex. Now, Shmuley isn't Chassidic, but we were Lubavitch, which means the woman has to keep her hair covered during sex. Oh, and sure, the "niddah" period during the period and for an additional week leads to lust, but don't you sometimes want to hug each other? You can't share the same bed during that time? The woman can't even SIT on the man's bed during that time so as to not arouse him. You cannot pass things directly to each other and you have to put something on the table when you sit together to serve as a reminder that you cannot touch or pass things to each other. You cannot even pass a baby to each other. Sure, *sets it next to my hand on counter*, then I pick it up.

I sat there trying not to notice, but they were seated directly across from our table and in my line of view. My Dad asked why I didn't speak up and say something, I was the only one at the table who heard the commotion; I didn't want to piss off the Husband and receive an unnecessary bitching. Felt so sorry for their daughter. Unfortunately she might be used to it.

This was at a fancy restaurant in Plano, TX.

<TITLE> Contacting my biological father </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-04 20:57:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Through 23andMe I started to question whether the individual I came to know as my Dad was in fact my biological father. Turns out I was right. I never brought it up to my parents because we were going through enough stress at the time. 

Mid-August, my Mom finally came clean with the information. She was legally responsible in telling us (as stated in court documents) and withheld this information from us for over a decade. The documents permitted her to release the information once we (myself and my siblings - two older brothers) reached 18 years of age. I am the youngest and now 27. I laughed when my Mom brought out the legal papers. She asked why and I told her I had figured it out months ago. She was upset I never mentioned it to her, and I wish I hadn't waited. 

I know who he is, know where he lives. I even know and have is phone number. I've called at least once a day for the past few weeks, but no one answers and the call goes straight to voice mail. I wonder if they have caller ID and decide not to answer (so I often call with an unknown number) or his wife deletes my number (which is screwed up seeing how she's a licensed psychologist - yes, I've done my research). Either way, I have had no luck.

One thing I really find unnerving is ~~that~~ the fact I always wish I had a sister. Turns out I have two older half-sisters and one half-brother. I had a third older half-sister but she passed away in 1983. My middle name was in honor of her. 

Would it be wrong for ~~my~~ me to leave a message on their answering machine or messaging him over Facebook? I want to meet him. Based on what my Mom has shared, we have a lot in common; and what I have discovered through my own research.  As a kid, I always brought up ideas and concepts that my Mom thought were stupid and I finally understand why - it's something he would have thought or been in favor of doing. 

I saw him once, but didn't know who he was. I was 18 years-old and out to eat at Panera with my Mom. After bringing the food back to the table I told her that a table of older men kept staring at me. I do not recall her reply, but once they left the restaurant, she informed me it was him.  </TEXT>

For pricing, she might accept your insurance or provide some sort of payment options. You'll have to discuss that with her.

This even happens after drinking English Morning Tea. I stopped drinking the tea for a while because it started making me sick, even with a full stomach. 

Perhaps I have a different reaction to caffeine. Either way, it is quite annoying.

The same thing can be said about grocery stores. If it's busy and a sacker isn't available; sack your own groceries while items are being rang up. It will cut down on the time spent by the checker and holding up the line.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Recipe: http://www.surrealconfections.com/2013/03/irish-crepe-cake.html?m=1

Tips:

- Each crepe takes between 15-20min to prepare. ~10 minutes for the first side and, give or take a few, about 5-10 once you flipped to the other side.

- If you have more than one saute pan, you'll be a lot happier. I wish I had at least 4. Otherwise I spent between 3-4 hours just to make the crepes.

- Try not to eat all the whipped cream before spreading it onto the crepes!!! :-)

Sorry for the bad pictures. I was really excited to make this for St. Patty's  and wanted to share; even though it looks sloppy. 

Edit: More info </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unless you work for a business owned by a family and you all eat lunch together. Instead of going back to work, if nothing needed to be done immediately, we'd take a full hour break (or longer). Plus on Thursdays, they'd pay for my lunch when we ordered chinese food from a restaurant nearby with great lunch specials. 

It depends on the work environment, but I always enjoyed lunch breaks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never understood the obsession other women have over diamonds and always felt it was a marketing scheme. Turns out my intuitions were right.

In today's world, a lot of marketing can be seen as a scheme. Hell with all the photoshop enhanced pictures, even what is perceived as 'true beauty' is a scheme. Unfortunately a lot of people fall for the hype. 

I didn't post this for intentions of 'clickbait'. I share stories I find interesting, and with other people. That's what this sub-reddit is all about, whether or not you agree, or approve, of the post.

<TEXT> A good memory isn't necessarily genetic. It, like all forms of learning, requires repetition. 

Math is a necessity in life. Especially if you want to excel in todays world. 


Binary Coding = Math

Physics = Math

Computer Science = Math

And the basics:
Econ, Accounting, etc.


I grew up hating math because teachers used a method I never understood. Let me rephrase that. It was something I wanted to understand and would tell them that they needed to actually show me how to do it, not just tell me. It clearly wasn't something they could handle. A week after my first college math course, I finally understood what I hadn't years earlier b/c someone took the time to explain it to me in a language I finally understood. Since then I have loved math.


Also:
Instead of just teaching math, teachers should provide real-world examples of it being used. If you want a student to appreciate what they're doing, actually show how it will benefit them later on.

After serving an AmeriCorps term and working at Harvesters - Community Food Network, I have had first hand experience working with families in need. With all the govt. shutdown nonsense affecting recipients of WIC, this will only create more problems for these families and the life and well-being of (KS) citizens.

It is great to see a 'sneaky frat guy' actually showed respect for a drunken female. This DOES NOT mean all frat guys behave the same way. I've had my fair share of run ins with college douchebags, so I know.

As so, I have respect for this individual - - not all frat guys.

Oh and my brother is an alumni of a fraternity, so I have respect for those I know are actual gentleman.

<TEXT> Here are two sites you might want to check out:

1.  Migraine Associated Vertigo (MAV) 
(http://vestibular.org/migraine-associated-vertigo-mav).

2. Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) (http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/neurology_neurosurgery/specialty_areas/vestibular/conditions/benign_paroxysmal_positional_vertigo.html)


From March 2008-July 2013 I was misdiagnosed as having Menieres. After receiving little assistance from my ENT, I decided to try and manage my dizziness on my own. This was quite a challenge given the fact I still didnt understand why I was dizzy.

Within the past year I decided I wanted to get rid of, or at least try to treat, this problem. After doing a lot of research for specialists in my area, I came across an Audiologist not far from here. After the first round of testing, my previous diagnosis turned out to be wrong. Through these tests alone, it was determined that I had Migraine Associated Vertigo (MAV). Coincidentally I suffered from chronic migraines (diagnosed as depression) throughout high school (Sophomore - Senior year) and had a few years of 'relaxation' (3 years) until the vertigo spells started. The culprit? ***STRESS*** 

After coming to this conclusion, I still had to take into consideration that once I started having dizzy spells, I too lost the ability (equilibrium wise) to play sports, run, dance, etc. My life went from being a fun, energetic college student, to a recluse. I could no longer stand this and spoke to my Audiologist about this very problem. He introduced me to the Vestibular Therapist in the office and after only a months work, Im no longer dizzy and my ears stopped ringing (experienced Tinnitus 24 a day/ 7 days a week for the past 5+ years). If my ears start to ring, its usually a sign that my bodys telling me to stop, and relax.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you happen to have another cat, this breed tends to be territorial. Found this out after watching a few episodes of 'My Cat from Hell', and my mom just assumed it couldn't be fixed. Unforunately, it would have been an easy thing to do- had I only known at the time. She made me get rid of Bella after having her for only 2 years.

But..on to the good stuff:

Such a great breed, especially if you're in the mood for a playful, energetic and lovable kitty! Congrats!! :-D

<TEXT> Oh eyebrows...once upon a time I had great eyebrows. Nice thickness and shape, but I was in high school and getting your eyebrows waxed was cool. So I went in and she took off too much - and well---- they never grew back (on both sides). On the left side (in the before picture) all visible brow was medically inserted years ago, to ensure I still somewhat had an eyebrow. It worked, for the most part, but transplanting hair (from say your head) to your face, it doesn't grow like facial hair....at all. Drawing them on hasn't been a great experience b/c I use to draw on a brown line and thought that would suffice. No wonder I received a lot of stares. Now I have a better idea of how they should look, just do not know how to go about drawing them! </TEXT>

Scaring certainly makes me self-conscious and I have even looked in to Dermabrasion, but it won't work the same for me as for others. Due to thinner skin (i.e. skin graft) plus missing bone tissue, muscle, etc, hiding such scars is quite a challenge.

Thank you for your kind words of advice! :-)

<TEXT> When dealing with blush, I either can't see it or it's too overpowering. Can't seem to find a brand that compliments my skin tone. 

Eyeshadow is quite a bit different. As you can see, I have scaring above my left eye. More so, my entire eyelid consists of a skin graft. This makes applying eye makeup to be quite a challenge. Especially when I want to do something colorful and creative. Sorry, I should have made that problem more clear from the start. </TEXT>

Lip color - ugh, that's a whole new challenge. I like light colors (i.e light pink, light bronze, just a shimmer, etc.) By not working much with lipsticks, etc. I haven't found a color that matches well. Or I find that it's too overpowering.

<TEXT> My story:


I was hit by a car when I was a child (3 years of age - 1989 to give you a better idea of the time). Following the accident, I was both mentally and physically impaired. Both of which were apparent to the average person. As so I sought help via plastic surgery (and education...but that's another story). That is a lot to go through as a child and I am doing whatever possible to not seek help from that 'source of perfection'.


That is why I am here.


As you can see, I am rather pale, must draw on eyebrows, and the like, on a daily basis. No matter what I do, I cannot retain much color to my face. Over the past few months, I have experimented with different eye shadows and blush, but nothing seems to work. Also considered changing my hair color, but brown eyes make pairing quite a challenge. (i.e. I LOVE the woman's hair in the Wendy's commercials, but she also has blue eyes, so I'm not so sure if it would work.)


If you have any advice, please feel free to share!


Edit: I've tried darks and lights (hair color) but never seem to know what to do with my overall makeup. Even tried dirty-blonde-streaks back in high school, and to be honest, it looked ridiculous. I also knew very little about makeup, so that's possibly a reason.

Take this for instance: the Dolphin Illusion - a child will see dolphins on the bottle where as, adults see a intimate pose (or most do). Research has shown that young children cannot identify the intimate couple because they do not have prior memory associated with such a scenario.

<TEXT> I know it crossed my mind a time or two, but I rarely took it in to consideration. After meeting Dan Barker a few years back, I began to realize just how much of a problem this was. First off, we (the US) are not solely a 'Christian Nation' and symbolizing such a thing on US Currency only provides more problems. I'm not sure where to go from there because that should make it rather clear, but I would like to point out the fact that (former motto) 'E pluribus unum': One out of many - seemed just fine. </TEXT>

Here's the link:
http://ffrf.org/news/news-releases/item/17021-atheists-seek-to-take-god-off-currency


"In God we trust " was adopted as the official motto of the United States in **1956** as an alternative or replacement to the unofficial motto of E pluribus unum, adopted when the Great Seal of the United States was created and adopted in 1782.[1][2]
"In God we trust" has appeared **on most** (not all) U.S. coins since 1864[3] and on paper currency since 1957

**    **

*: 4 *

1 cups red or brown lentils, rinsed

1 cup canned chopped tomatoes with their juice

3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

8 garlic cloves, peeled

2 teaspoons coarse sea salt or kosher salt

4 slices peeled fresh ginger, each about the size of a quarter

1 sprig rosemary

1 bay leaf

1 (10 ounces) bag washed baby spinach

2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice

Freshly milled black pepper


1.	In a pressure cooker (*       20-25        *) over high heat, combine 5 cups of water with the lentils, tomatoes, oil, garlic, and salt. Wrap the ginger, rosemary, and bay leaf in a piece of cheesecloth, tie it closed with kitchen string, and add this bouquet garni to the pot. Lock the life in place and bring to full pressure. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes.

2.	Transfer the pressure cooker to the sink and run cold water over it to release the pressure. Remove the lid and discard the bouquet garni. 

3.	Return the pot to medium heat. Add the spinach and simmer until wilted. Stir in the lemon juice. Crush the garlic against the side of the pot with the back of a spoon and stir so that all the garlic completely melts into the soup. Add pepper and serve immediately. 


**      **

*: 4 *


*   *:

2 cups whole-milk yogurt

1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro

1 garlic clove, minced

1-teaspoon coarse sea salt or kosher salt

 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste



*  *:

2 cups all-purpose flour

1-cup buckwheat flour

2 teaspoons coarse sea salt or kosher salt

2 teaspoons baking powder

3 cups whole-milk

4 large eggs

2 tablespoons melted butter or neutral oil, such as grape seed, canola, or sunflower

3 cups shredded green cabbage (1 small head)

1 cup shredded peeled carrot (about 3 medium carrots)

6 scallions, white and tender green parts only, thinly sliced

2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill

 cup neutral oil, such as grape seed, canola, or sunflower

Fresh cilantro sprigs for garnish


1.	Preheat the over to 250.

2.	To prepare the yogurt sauce, in a small bowl, stir together all the ingredients until well combined. Chill until ready to serve

3.	To make the pancake batter, in a large bowl, whisk together the flours, salt, and baking powder. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, eggs, and butter or oil. Pour the wet mixture over the dry and stir to combine.

4.	Add the cabbage, carrots, scallions, and dill to the batter and mix well. The batter will be thick.

5.	In a large (or 2 small) saut pan(s) or skillet(s) over medium heat, warm  cup of oil. When the oil I shot, pour a scant cup of batter into the pan to form a pancake and fry for 5 minutes. Flip the pancakes and fry for 5 minutes more. As you finish each pancake, transfer it to a rimmed baking sheet and keep warm in the oven.

6.	Transfer the pancakes to a clean cutting surface and cut each one into 4 wedges. Arrange 4 to 6 wedges on each of 4 plates. Pour yogurt sauce on top and garnish with cilantro sprigs.

<TEXT> Recipes in order: Quick-Cooked Tomatillo Sauce (Salsa Verde), Thick Cream (Crema Espesa), and Layered Tortilla Casserole  (Budn de Tortillas) 

**Quick-Cooked Tomatillo Sauce** (Salsa Verde)

Ingredients: (Yield 2 to 3 cups)

-	1 lb (11 medium) fresh tomatillos, husked and washed OR two 13-ounce cans tomatillos, drained.

-	Fresh hot green chiles to taste (roughly 3 chiles seranos or 2 chiles jalapenos), stemmed

-	5 or 6 sprigs fresh coriander (cilantro), roughly chopped

-	1 small onion, chopped

-	1 large clove garlic, peeled and roughly chopped

-	1 tablespoon lard or vegetable oil

-	2 cups any poultry or meat broth (depending on how the sauce is to be used)

-	Salt, about  teaspoon (depending on the saltiness of the broth)

1.	*The tomatillos*. Boil the fresh tomatillos and chiles in salted water to cover until tender, 10 to 15 minutes; drain. Simply drain canned tomatillos.
2.	*The puree*. Place the tomatillos and chiles (raw ones if using canned tomatillos) in a blender or food processor, along with the coriander, onion and garlic; if using a blender, stir well. Process until smooth, but still retaining a *little* texture.
3.	*The Sauce*. Heat the lard or vegetable oil in a medium-large skillet set over medium-high. When hot enough to make a drop of the puree sizzle sharply, pour it in all at once and stir constantly for 4-5 minutes, until darker and thicker. Add the broth, let return to a boil, reduce the heat to medium and simmer until thick enough to coat a spoon, about 10 minutes. Season with salt.

**Thick Cream** (Crema Espesa) 

***Instead of this recipe, we just mixed heavy whipping cream and sour cream. But, this is the more traditional approach to preparing thick cream. If preparing this, start a full day ahead (or longer, if the incubating spot is cool). The cream will keep for 1 weeks or more, covered and refrigerated. 

Ingredients:

-	1 cup whipping cream

-	2 tablespoons buttermilk

1.	*Preparing the cream*. Pour the cream into a small sauce-pan, set over low heat and stir just until the chill is off, *do not* heat above 100 (lukewarm). Stir in the buttermilk and pour into a glass jar
2.	*Ripening the cream*. Set the lid on the jar (but dont tighten it) and place in a warm (80-90) spot. Let the cream culture and set for 12 to 24 hours, until noticeably thicker (perhaps almost set like yogurt or sour cream). Stir gently, screw on the lid and refrigerate at least 4 hours to chill and complete the thickening. 

**Layered Tortilla Casserole**  (Budn de Tortillas)

Ingredients:

-	Vegetable Oil

-	12 corn tortillas (we used soft corn tortillas)

-	2 cups Quick-Cooked Tomatillo Sauce (Salsa Verde)  *recipe above*

-	3 large chile poblanos (we used 5 Anaheim peppers) -- Roasted, peeled, seeded and sliced

-	1 cups Thick Cream, or thinned commercial sour cream  *recipe above*

-	1 cups (6 ounces) grated melting cheese like mild cheddar of Monterey Jack.

1.	Quick-fry 12 corn tortillas in vegetable oil, 2 or 3 seconds per side, then drain well.
2.	Line the bottom of a 9-inch-square baking dish with 3 tortillas (slightly overlapping).
3.	Top with  of the sauce, cream and cheese, and 1/3 of the chiles; repeat with three more layers (the top will have no chiles).
4.	Cover and bake at 350 for 30 minutes. Strew with onion rings, (and radish rounds), then serve.
5.	Optional: 1 cups shredded cooked chicken, pork or fish can be layered with the chiles.

*Recipe
(Arroz con Leche)*

This dessert is softer and more cinnamony than our baked rice pudding. The flavors are simple and close to home, but its easy to develop a thoroughgoing love for it, spoonful after spoonful. Mexican people everywhere serve it as regularly as they do flan; its creamy and, in its own way, light and soothing.

This is an especially pretty and tasty recipe, based on one from Zelayarans Las 500 mejores recetas de la cocina mexicana.

Yield : 8 to 10 servings

**Ingredients**

2 inches cinnamon stick
A 2-inch strip of lime zest (colored rind only),  inch wide
1 cup rice
1 quart milk
 cup sugar
 teaspoon salt
4 large egg yolks
 teaspoon vanilla extract
 cup raisins
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, cut into bits
Ground cinnamon, for garnish

Directions:

1. **The rice:** Bring 2 cups water to a boil in a medium-size saucepan, add the cinnamon stick and lime zest, then cover and simmer over medium heat for 5 minutes. Pour in the rice, let the mixture return to a boil, stir once, then cover and cook over medium-low heat for 20 minutes, until all the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender.

2. **The pudding:** Stir in the milk, sugar and salt, and simmer over medium to medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until the liquid shows the first signs of thickening, 20 to 25 minutes. Take from the heat and remove the cinnamon stick and zest. Beat the egg yolks until runny, stir in the vanilla and a few tablespoons of the hot rice, then stir the yolk concoction back into the rice mixture. Mix in half the raisins, then spoon the rice pudding into a decorative 8-inch-square baking dish.

3. **Browning and finishing the pudding:** Preheat the broiler and dot the rice pudding with butter. Set the dish under the heat long enough to brown the top, 3 or 4 minutes. Sprinkle with the remaining raisins and the ground cinnamon, and serve warm or at room temperature.


*Techniques*

**Thickening the Rice:** In Step 2, the mixture should be simmered only until the milk takes on a slight creaminess (it will still look soupy). Overcooking will give you something dense and unapproachable. Should the latter be your fate, stir in a few tablespoons of milk just al youre about to serve, dot with butter and brown again.


*Timing and Advance Preparation*

The rice pudding can be ready in an hour, much of which wont involve your direct participation. It may be prepared through Step 2 a day or two ahead, then buttered and broiled shortly before serving.

*Regional Explorations*

Rice pudding brings to my mind the volatile, chancy crowd of Mexico Citys Garibaldi Square, where this dessert, only one of the attractions, sits in huge, milky masses stuck with a raisin or two for decoration. Or sometimes Im reminded of the well-used walkways around the Oaxacan market, where ladies sell it in paper cups at sundown. Or I picture any of a dozen other typical scenes: from rude, makeshift street stands to well-appointed traditional restaurantswhere arroz con lecbe is the thing you have.

<TEXT> EXACTLY! Thanks for the reply! ^

Most (if not all) grocery stores (unless privately owned Co-Ops) receive all their produce from the same location. Hints why the UPC codes for produce do not change upon location! This makes express checkouts (self-checkouts) a great thing to use! (Also worked at Dillons in high school so I recall most of the codes....)

Meat providers possibly stay the same, that I do not know. In regards to dairy, well clearly Dillons/Kroger has a different private provider than WalMart - aside from the name-brands that appear in every store: i.e. Silk, Roberts, etc.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whoa there, being educated wasn't an issue. Before getting the IUD, I had read through a lot before deciding to get it. I know how the ring works, where it is placed, etc. It just surprises me that, even when feeling around, she still missed the ring - when I went in for the month check-up, last Friday! I recall stating to her that I had forgotten to take it out and she said she would before inserting the IUD. Clearly she forgot. 

In response to how long to use it, I was (at the time) wearing the 2nd of a sample pack - and yes it was in the span of 3-weeks. Of course now it has been over a month, with the same ring. Of which I did not know was there to begin with.

THE MODEL girlfriend of Olympic hero Oscar Pistorius spent her final minutes cowering behind a bathroom door after a late-night fight with her gun-loving boyfriend.

They sure do put a lot of emphasis on model. Maybe it's just me and the fact I hate models, Hollywood and the like or maybe I see that tabloids, stories, etc aren't written in an attempt for people to understand the true impact of the situation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tabloids are trash - that's a known fact. Perhaps this was just a bad article and that's unfortunate. 

I'm not saying it's objectifying in any manner, the fact they used that as a key word in the title makes you wonder if anyone cares about his mental state or more of the fact, who he killed. Why not just refer to her as  Reeva Steenkamp - in the same way why isn't 'athlete' in front of Oscar Pistorius? Model seems to be overused....like it's supposed to hold some significance.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just fail to understand the fuss about it, as long as you're in the comforts of your own home. Since it asked about 'married couples', I wanted to point out the fact you don't have to be married to feel comfortable around each other. I do my best not to 'toot' around him, but it's a natural process the body experiences. And hey, we've grown to laugh at the cost of what others would find grotesque and unappealing - in order to not take everything so seriously and to just relax and understand it's a part of life. 

Taking a shit on your from lawn isn't the same. That clearly includes the public and violation of law.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sauce was a last minute thing. First we tried melting the fresco queso  (with heavy cream) over a double-broiler, but the consistency was still lumpy, grainy, and the sauce had little taste. We decided to add hand-grated swiss cheese and some of the 4-cheese package varieties from Sargento. Even after using a submersion blender, we couldn't get past the graininess. By then we were too hungry to care (well past 8:30 pm central time). Also sprinkled in cumin, red pepper flakes and whatever else my boyfriend happened to slip it. It added a great flavor, but we will be sure to check out a good recipe next time (instead of just winging it). </TEXT>

By living in KANSAS, of all states, receiving input on the benefits of ObamaCare are slim to none. I've tried to make sense of it all, but until something is put in place, we really have no idea what to expect.

I should also add that I'm 99.99999999999% against most politicians (and take neither side). What comes out of their mouth and what's written on paper (and mandated in to law), are two different things. I'm afraid whatever Congress has hidden up their sleeve might actually have a detrimental affect on society.

<TITLE> Has anyone else been denied insurance for misdiagnosed pre-existing conditions? Are you like me and feel the system should be changed? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I understand this post may come as a duh for some redditors out there, but I have something Ive wanted to get off my chest for the past few days.

A couple weeks ago I was diagnosed with a medical condition. Low and behold, it was the underlying cause for every medical problem I have had since I was in high school (12 years). Theses consisted of blackout headaches, sudden vertigo (that would last for weeks), uncontrollable irritability, and the list goes on. 

Now I am left to wonder, how can insurance companies deny me for pre-existing conditions when none were, in fact, the correct diagnosis. I applied for insurance within the past year, after losing what was  provided by the university (as a student), and found myself in quite a struggle because they continuously denied me coverage. Oddly enough, one was a company I had previously received coverage under before turning 18 (parents insurance). 

Now I am left, unable to find reliable insurance because I was misdiagnosed for most of my life. 

Am I the only one out there who feels this is in need of change? If you're denied insurance for reasons that weren't in fact true, how is that working in favor for both the companies and those needing coverage?

Sadly we live in a society (UK, US, etc) that promotes activities that aren't necessarily good for your health. Do realize though, back in the 1940s, smoking was considered cool and was featured 'as the thing to do' in most movies and other cinema. 70+ years later and we (given the scientific proof) know that people weren't as informed as they should have been. Perhaps this is a sign that we need to further inform younger generations of the true hazards this may cause to their health.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a reason we've been told (for how many years now?) to avoid high levels of UV light (aka tanning beds). Of course UV light becomes a problem, when out in the sun, but you stand a greater chance the closer you venture towards the equator OR if you spend a day at the lake and forget to reapply sunscreen. 

Ended up turning bright red (in Playa del Carmen) b/c I was too focused on having fun with the open bar, beach side view and relaxing pool. Didn't realize I was burnt until someone (coincidentally from the same part/state of the US) pointed it out. That trip dramatically turned south. I'm forbidden from using tanning beds by my doctors (increased chance of skin cancer), so when something like that happens, I do my best to never do it again. 

Honestly do not understand peoples fascination with tanning beds. I know someone who's 3 years younger but looks over 10 years older because her skin is permantely damaged and looks leathery - how is that appealing? I understand the warmth is nice, but is it worth it in the long run? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know this through experience. I suffered a TBI after being hit by a car around the age of 3 (1989). For rehabilitation purposes, my mom was told to buy me a cat. By maintaining a form of companionship with every cat I've had since then, I view it as a learning experience. Especially in learning how to care for another living creature. I understand caring for a cat and caring for a human are completely different things, but it still requires an understanding that's essential for children and adults, alike. 

Also, after the accident I stopped playing with toys. That was due in part to the injury and a 'shift' in my cognitive and neuropsychological abilities - but further emphasizes the companionship maintained with the fury feline friends.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I appreciate your posting of this, but the 2nd to last paragraph clearly makes the article pointless to read. It states:

Despite the efforts of the humble earthworm, the vast majority of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere - which is responsible for 60% of the total warming from greenhouse gases - is caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.
----------------
But earthworms only account for about 16% of greenhouse gases. How's that a concern? Worms have existed for millennia, but we (humans) haven't.

I understand their intention, but it doesn't seem to account for much. Especially when compared to human interventions.  </TEXT>

The only downside is the fact some of us take the pill/ use an IUD because we have to for hormonal reasons, not because we're sexually active. In my case, Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. May not sound too bad, but I'm only in my mid-20s.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of course it is one of the best documentaries of 2012 but it (the documentary) is popular for what it's showing the world - biases towards music (due to racism, mental health, people being @ssholes, etc.) in the 1970s NOT racism today. He's famous today because individuals took the time to understand his story and share it with world. 

Without the collaboration of the two individuals, the likelihood of you knowing of Rodriguez would be slim to none. He would still remain a legend - unknown to us - but popular in South Africa. Hell, everyone thought he was dead for decades until someone took the time to check and with that curiosity, came this documentary. Now you are left with this post trying to emphasize certain key aspects of the documentary and how it has/could shape what we know today. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your comment brought to light the idea that we (as a society) need to reshape what we view as good. In today's world, it doesn't matter whether or not you have talent. Your luck of rising to fame has to do with looks, sex appeal, etc. 

Rodriguez wrote about the life he lived, but in a manner not accepted by 70s US culture. Shows like American Idol fully emphasize sex appeal and the like, over actual talent. I feel Rodriguez tried to push the boundaries at an earlier stage but we were too ignorant, of a society, to accept this. 

I will agree too on the lack of of musical talent for Bob Dylan, but that only further emphasizes my point. Or at least I think it does. I could be wrong.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Then the music industry is to blame? What made Santana any better? They both 'rose to fame' during the same time, but only one received recognition. 

He did everything in his power to sell music, but only 6 ALBUMS were sold in the US. The music was out there, but no one knew of it. Highly doubt that's a coincidence. 

PLUS: People would scratch out his top hit - 'Sugar Man'. Why on earth would people do that unless they wanted to keep him from becoming famous? </TEXT>

<TEXT> In order to gain attention, you must first attract people. He wasn't put in the proper position to do that and since race became an issue, that only pushed him further back. If you check, Santana and Jose Feliciano, both gained fame around this same time (late-60s and early-70s) Also, neither one was a US born citizen. Both were from other countries that possibly helped promote their fame. Since Rodriguez did not have an acceptable contract nor willingness from others, he was left in the dumps. Rather sad his music held no purpose where it was produced - US - but a bootleg version - in South Africa - brought him the fame he never thought he'd reach. 

I disagree on quality. I find his songs to hold a lyrical value and his voice only adds to it. One more thing - Bob Dylan rose to fame during the same time - 1960s-1970s. Rodriguez had the unfortunate circumstance of sounding a lot like Dylan, through the sound of his music. Perhaps this held a negative impact on his career. 

I absolutely adore his ability to refrain from accepting the fame - be it for mental, drug or whatever issues - that really doesn't matter. He did not let the fame get to his head and take away what he wanted from life. I would like to see musicians of today refrain from the fame and fortunes of their career - but it's not likely. 


***I have a different way of understanding what happened. Perhaps my approach is different than yours, and others, but I like to gain a clearer understanding as to why he never became famous in the US. I take what I know and go from there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bob Dylan of Detroit, Michigan - Elvis Presley of South Africa. 

Depends on the location. Either way he never gained popularity in the US (until now) due to his race. Use of the name Rodriguez during the 1970s made listeners refrain from listening b/c they expected him to be 'non-white. Quite an unfortunate story. It's even more remarkable the type of life he maintained (and still maintains) no matter the fame or fortune. 

True understanding of life and the pursuit of happiness. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Congrats on understanding the concept of an exaggeration (and/or a foolish statement)! You would be surprised how often it is used to gain appeal from others. Ironically, I had no intentions of this. More so, I stated my overall view of the film. Why, might you ask, did I state (in full-context): 'The story that unfolds is nothing you could have every imagined'?

I have always found the human mind/ human experience (non-religious) to be an amazing thing. When you look right down to it, we still do not understand the true impact of the human mind. Over the next few years I hope to gain a greater understanding of this (through neuropsychology) and I felt The Imposter was an appropriate start 

It really depends on what you are looking for in a film. As a documentary I understood there would be limitations as to what could be shared but, overall, they portrayed the situation rather well. At the start of the documentary, did you expect the story to turn out as it did? I highly doubt this. 

I know several of you hated the move (1/10, etc.) but something about the film clearly struck other viewers. Why else did it receive such renowned support at the Sundance Film Festive and several other awards and nominations?
