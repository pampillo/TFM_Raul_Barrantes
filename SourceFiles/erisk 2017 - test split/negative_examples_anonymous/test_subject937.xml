<TEXT> The power of the Supreme Court rests almost exclusively on its perceived authority. If that credibility is lost, so is its power. Also, the Supreme Court has very little control over what subject matter it adjudicates - cases are brought to it, not the other way around.

The other two branches have military power (the President) and the power to tax and spend (Congress). </TEXT>

If not, [here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick-fil-A_same-sex_marriage_controversy) the Wikipedia entry.

Clearly the public will not "punish" all businesses for being anti-homosexuality. We have a modern example where the business actually benefited from it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I want to enable people to live freely.

Surely you acknowledge there are limitations (e.g., freedom to kill other people).

Non-discrimination in public accommodations is simply another reasonable limitation. The government has said that as a condition of receiving the perks of being a corporation, that corporation must follow certain rules, including not refusing service based on race.

The freedom argument only makes sense if you think, say, your freedom is unjustly restricted because you can't kill anyone you want. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can you find any analysis of this private free speech principle? I've looked and haven't ever really found anything.

Personally, I don't think it exists (because it is unworkable). The public just assumes it does because of how important the well-known public free speech principle is.

I do agree that anyone who promises no censorship but then censors is hypocritical. But they didn't violate my freedom of speech.

I'd also like to point out that we're really talking about degree here. This site is already moderated and censored (no child porn).

Edit: As for questioning a private company that doesn't allow "free for all" free speech, I strongly disagree. Businesses are not public discourse vehicles. If my employees tried to debate the merits of slavery with my customers, I would likely fire them (with good reason). </TEXT>

Do I owe you freedom of speech? If I invite you over and you tell my child he shouldn't be able to get married because he's gay, am I wronging you in some way by asking you to leave?

I would really like to read an analysis of this concept, because every time it comes up, it doesn't seem to be a valid concept (when analyzed thoroughly). </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's my point.

I'm really not aware of a concept of "free speech" apart from the public right. The government is supposed to get out of the debate so it can be freely had. And the point of all this is not to debate _per se_, it's for ideas to compete, and win or lose based on their merits (e.g., feeding babies = good, child rape = bad).

But when a private individual says "_X_ is wrong", it's no one's place to then force that individual to say otherwise. I'm gay but don't think I can go into Mike Huckabee's house and force him to give me a platform to advocate gay marriage. However, if he has opened his house up to debate (better analogy to Reddit), and then decides to close it - well, all we can do is leave.

But in both examples, no one's free speech has been violated. It just doesn't seem to be a concept that withstands scrutiny when invoked as between two private individuals.

Do you have a link to a treatise on non-public freedom of speech? I'm genuinely curious because this comes up every time a corporation does something that someone disagrees with (e.g., Chick-fil-A). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think a "private" right of free speech makes sense as a concept.

How would that work? Is Reddit supposed to be prevented from banning FPH (and by whom)?

The marketplace of ideas isn't desirable simply to have concepts lobbed back and forth, it's desirable to discuss those concepts _and judge them_.

Edit: Can anyone link to an analysis of the "philosophical ideal" of a private right to freedom of speech?  </TEXT>

Racists made the argument in the 60's that integration violated their religious beliefs.

<TEXT> You seem to be looking at this from an immature perspective. It's not about offending anyone or "staying classy".

First, if you ask someone you're casually dating if they're "fucking someone else", don't be surprised if you aren't soon dating them anymore.

Second, if you do ask in an appropriate manner, don't be surprised if the answer is something along the lines of "that's not your business".

Adults can have sex with whomever they want. If you're dating one (without exclusivity), it's really not your business. If you want to ask, go ahead - but accept the response and consequences of doing so.

Ultimately, if you want the right to be upset that someone else is "inside of" them too, then ask to be exclusive. This is not hard stuff. </TEXT>

<TEXT> His Wikipedia page states that he resigned in the face of an investigation and, while it cleared him, it criticized him for ethical lapses.

Do you have a source for your information? I'm still looking but your comments make it sound like he was left out for obviously partisan purposes.

Edit: The resignation was a separate incident from the nomination withdrawal. There's not much I can find on the nomination withdrawal but it seems like he was fairly controversial.

Edit 2: The New York Times had a pretty damning [editorial](http://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/29/opinion/mr-meese-should-withdraw.html) about why he should have withdrawn, and did Reagan's own then-Attorney General appoint the special prosecutor to investigate? </TEXT>

OP, if you want objective stats about crime, natural beauty, activities, quality of life, standard of living, job opportunities, future growth,  cost of living, etc., just use Google. Augusta is always ranked very highly.

<TEXT> Under federal law, private businesses that are open to the public cannot discriminate based on certain criteria (e.g., race, sex, religion).

That is also why those who claim this isn't aimed at LGBTs are full of shit. Sexual orientation and gender identity DO NOT make the list mentioned above (but should). Therefore, the standard protected classes will not be affected by this law because the Civil Rights Act of 1964 trumps state law. This leaves one obvious gap: LGBTs. </TEXT>

Requiring handwritten, personally-researched letters to our representatives is an excellent way to keep them free from voter input.

You left out one group that does not have federal protections (from legislation such as this): homosexuals. Is the possibility of a judge ruling against a homosexual as absurd as you think your other examples are?

Overall, religious freedom is protected by the First Amendment. I don't see what lack of religious freedom this bill is trying to address. It's just hard to believe the uptick in this sort of legislation has _nothing_ to do with the pending marriage lawsuit in the SCOTUS. Doesn't pass the smell test. </TEXT>

You're trying to back peddle now by saying "most" have congressional input. That wasn't your original claim at all.

You're also now admitting you're not an expert, which I take to mean you have no legal training. I do, including studying international law in the U.S. and abroad. You're understanding of the law here is simply wrong.

<TEXT> That is a definitional argument. Big "t" Treaties are pursuant to the Treaty Cause; small "t" treaties aren't. That is the only meaningful difference.

International law makes no distinction between the two; only U.S. law does. A U.S. President signing a sole executive agreement pursuant to his authority as C-in-C is no less a treaty than one ratified by the Senate.

And, by the way, a statute is only as good so long as the sitting Congress wishes it to be (generally). It is no surprise that lawmaking is dependent upon lawmakers. </TEXT>

That is a congressional report with case citations, not an ehow page. There are sections that address each of your points, I think.

Edit: Here's the footnote refuting your claim that sole executive agreements cannot have the force of federal law (in italics):

Executive agreements have been held to be inferior to conflicting federal law when the agreement concerns matters 
expressly within the constitutional authority of Congress. See, e.g., United States v. Guy W. Capps, Inc., 204 F.2d 655 
(4th Cir. 1953) (finding that executive agreement contravening provisions of import statute was unenforceable); 
RESTATEMENT, supra footnote 1, 115 reporters n.5. *However, an executive agreement may trump pre-existing federal law if it concerns an enumerated or inherent executive power under the Constitution, or if Congress has historically 
acquiesced to the President entering agreements in the relevant area.* See Pink, 315 U.S. at 230 ([a]ll Constitutional 
acts of power, whether in the executive or in the judicial department, have as much legal validity and obligation as if 
they proceeded from the legislature) (quoting The Federalist No. 64 (John Jay)); Dames   Moore, 453 U.S. at 654 
(upholding sole executive agreement concerning the handling of Iranian assets in the United States, despite the 
existence of a potentially conflicting statute, given Congresss historical acquiescence to these types of agreements).

In other words, if it is a constitutional prerogative of the President, his signature alone can be binding. And you don't get much more Presidential than foreign policy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Understanding the Constitution requires more than merely reading it. There are centuries of practice and case law.

For example, there are 3 types of treaties, not just 1.  The President can enter into an executive agreement and on the international stage, it is just as much a treaty as one ratified by 2/3s of the Senate.

Also, it's undeniable that the President is in charge of negotiating foreign policy. I agree what they did wasn't treason, but it was highly inappropriate and they should be publicly shamed. Senators get to weigh in on foreign affairs in various ways. This is not one of them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This isn't /r/news. But there's a legal memo by the former GA Attorney General if you'd like to read it. The memo explains how the bill will cause problems.

His name is Michael Bowers. I can find it for you but it's easily found online.

Edit: Here it is: http://documents.buzzfeed.com/BowersMemo.pdf

<TEXT> Short version: if the government tries to prevent discrimination, religion can be used as a defense.

As long as the religious belief is sincerely held, it can be used to circumvent civil rights protections (such as serving gays).

Edit: Here's a memo from a former GA Attorney General explaining why the bill is a bad idea: http://documents.buzzfeed.com/BowersMemo.pdf </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Bill claimed to be filming in a war zone, but he wasn't stating that it was a literal war zone.

This seems very generous to Bill O'Reilly. He repeatedly used his experience in a "war zone" to bolster his credibility on war reporting.

Every quote I've read has no hint of anything other than a literal interpretation of "war zone".

Edit: This is a good example of what I'm talking about (from the [_Mother Jones_ article](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/02/bill-oreilly-brian-williams-falklands-war)):

In a 2004 column about US soldiers fighting in Iraq, O'Reilly noted, "Having survived a combat situation in Argentina during the Falklands war, I know that life-and-death decisions are made in a flash." </TEXT>

<TEXT>  47% (at the time, might be more or less now) of the US population pays nothing in federal income tax.

Romney's problem with that comment was going from "doesn't pay federal income taxes" to "dependent upon government, ... believe[s] that they are victims, ... believe[s] the government has a responsibility to care for them, ... believe[s] that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing", and then after all that claiming that "[he'll] never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives."

I don't disagree with this but it's a package deal most of the time. We've all seen the pictures of the Great Pyramids from Pizza Hut, and there is a McDonalds seemingly every few miles in Paris.

Simply put, where there is economic activity, chains are going to exist. A restaurant like Chipotle isn't necessarily a good thing to me personally, but I do recognize that it represents a growing local economy.

<TEXT> Thanks for the source. That will definitely complicate things for her, in my opinion.

Wouldn't there be only one of two possibilities here? (1) He was being detained or (2) he was not being detained (he clearly wasn't under arrest).

If he was being detained, there needs to be reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. What is the reasonable suspicion here? If the police officer does not have reasonable suspicion, he can just walk away. Likewise, if he was not being detained, he can just walk away. And that is even more so the case if the officer is simply taking his picture as a member of the public. Forcing him to stay would be false imprisonment in that situation (and there would be no investigation for her to interfere with).

As for an ongoing criminal investigation, wouldn't he be entitled to access to counsel if that was the case? It's not like this was immediately post-arrest (e.g. mugshot). This was outside of a courtroom after a hearing. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  It is not unforeseeable that community leaders would just appoint judges who will do what they want.

The governor of the state would likely be the person appointing judges. Judicial elections are awful. Generally, the electorate has no idea who is a good judge or who would make a good judge. The end result is that the local legal community (i.e., the "community leaders" you fear would be in charge were judges appointed) decides who wins. And that is a very tainted process.

Edit: I'd also like to point out that many states - like mine - have a hybrid system. If a judge retires before the expiration of his or her term, the Governor appoints his or her replacement. What's the net effect? Almost every judge retires before the end of their term. And since incumbent judges almost never lose, we essentially have an appointment process already.

Edit2: Also, even assuming races will be competitive, what is the likely pool of candidates? Attorneys. This means that if you run against a judge or lose in an open election, you run the risk of facing a less-than-favorable judge in court. This greatly discourages competitive races in places where judges are elected. </TEXT>

No it isn't. _See_, the Civil Rights Act of 1964. How we _actually_ do things here is to weigh rights versus state interests. If your religion requires that you murder your child for being raped, that is outweighed by the state's interest in preventing murder.

<TEXT> I guess I just don't see it. I'm born and raised as well (except for school) but my parents attended Augusta College, as have countless friends and family.

To me, it's just a name. I also don't get upset when people do whatever to the American flag. It's just a flag. And if the choice is between a great school without "Augusta" in its name, and a lesser school with it, I would choose the former without a thought. I don't think that was the choice but damned if everyone wasn't ready to torpedo the merger just to save the name.

And you're right, I don't have much patience for Augusta hate. But I don't see this as having anything to do with that. Georgia State, Georgia Southern, UGA, Mercer, Emory, etc., don't include the name of the city they are in, so it's not like Augusta was being singled out.

As for the level of involvement, I don't think it's beneficial in and of itself. Hell, this city went apeshit supporting Chick-fil-A as well and that was nothing more than bigotry. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But the CEO of a company paying out $10 million isn't likely to be an owner eligible to take distributions, correct?

I own a small business and pay myself distributions. My accountant advises me to keep it close to 50-50. If I were to pay myself a larger distribution, I would essentially have to pay myself an equivalently larger taxable salary (from what I understand). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you have examples?

If the CEO was set to earn an additional $10 million, but $9 million would go to the government as taxes if paid in wages, what non-wage, nontaxable compensation can the business spend its cash on that rises to that level?

Edit: I'm not denying there are ways. I'm genuinely asking. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  going out and maxing out credit cards on clothing and other non-seizable goods a few months before filing

If it's done with the intent of filing bankruptcy, yes, it's likely fraud. The difficult part is proving it. Plus, you're generally dealing with debts in the thousands so most major credit companies don't view it as a worthwhile fight (the big fraud fights I see are in Chapter 11s - business bankruptcies -  because the debts are in the millions).

It can be an embarrassing process but most people I run across view it in retrospect as a very simple process. The worst part is generally the self-inflicted shame.

Edit: And it sounds like you are on a much better path now: "No more credit card bills, and proper payment arrangements made with the doctors offices. I don't ever plan to do get into a mess like that again." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bankruptcy attorneys who know what they are doing will require payment up front for a Chapter 7 (which sounds like what you filed). If not, the remaining fee is a pre-petition debt that gets stayed and discharged just like any other. Importantly, the client could potentially sue the attorney for violating the stay if any collection efforts are made (such as calling for a payment).

Of course, if you hire a bankruptcy attorney who agrees to a post-petition payment plan with the intention of not paying (because you now know the above), that's probably fraud and not dischargeable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I _can_ distinguish between the two. But I also know that people with power tend to use that power. Keeping the two departments separate does not mean the owner's influence isn't felt: who is hired/fired, who is promoted, who gets invited to lunch, etc.

And then, yes, there are the people who cannot or do not distinguish the two. If you're worried about how the paper is perceived, it's not enough to say, "Well they shouldn't think that." They _do_, and that's the reality that must be dealt with.

_The Augusta Chronicle_ consistently wins awards and that speaks very well of the reporting side. But there's always that nagging thought that supporting the paper means you're supporting the editorial staff (because, well, you are to a degree - you're giving it a platform).

My main point is that the paper is perceived as a whole, facts be damned. This means that the hyper-fringe nature of the editorial staff causes people to shun the news content. </TEXT>

Augusta redditors will get out of this sub what they put into it. I post content frequently and encourage others to do the same.

But if there's one thing Augusta has plenty of, it's negative attitudes. Post more if you think it should be more active. </TEXT>

If your father refuses, then the rules are arbitrary and simply a power trip. That means he loses the high ground and it is completely reasonable for you to decline to visit.

Offer to respect him and his rules with a reasonable compromise. If he then chooses to disrespect your relationship and your boyfriend, he has no one else but himself to blame if you're not there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, they do. When a government employee does something in their official capacity, they are generally held to whatever government standard is applicable.

And it has nothing to do with a chain of command to me as a taxpayer. It has to do with the government being required to follow certain rules.

Short of security concerns, the government generally cannot prevent the press from reporting on its activities. That may (or may not) be applicable here.

But the fact that they are government employees is extremely relevant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The downtown is subpar relative to Greenville, I'll agree. But it's not bad on its own. I work and play mostly downtown and love it.

Have you been to Craft   Vine? That is a great bar. So is Bee's Knees. There's some room to grow but we definitely have some good bars.

I will have to completely disagree about the restaurants. Frog Hollow was singled out by GQ magazine as a must visit restaurant. And if we are extending out beyond downtown (which I don't think your original complaint was limited to downtown), there's Oliviana's, Fifth and Finch, Tako Sushi, Manuel's, Calvert's, La Maison, and 5 O'clock Bistro. Augusta is known for having many restaurants because of Masters week: many can make enough that one week to survive all year.

I'll also have to strongly disagree about the outdoor aspect. We host the largest Ironman in the country, are the home of disc golf, have a nice river and a canal, great bike trails, and generally pleasant weather. If you think Augusta isn't an "outdoor town", I suggest you're not taking advantage of what it offers.

As for live sporting - I'll agree except for the GreenJackets. But I see that as a function of size. How many cities our size have a lot of live sporting options? Ditto for live music.

Finally, as an unmarried professional, Augusta is overflowing with dating opportunities (and I'm a gay man which limits the pool significantly). Granted, I'm in a three year relationship but am involved and attend SO many things for the young professional crowd and EVERYONE is single.

Overall, my view is that your attitude plays a big part in all this. If you think Augusta sucks, you'll focus on the negative and Augusta will suck. But if you focus on the positive, you will see a city exploding with new and exciting things.

I love it here, and can back that up quite easily. </TEXT>

For live music, Sky City will likely be your venue. Whiskey Bar, Stillwater, Craft   Vine, and Bee's Knees are a few of the great bars downtown (off the top of my head).

<TEXT> I pretty much agree with your entire analysis but question where the line is. First Amendment freedom of speech is a political and legal right, and it should be.

Private freedom of speech can't be political or legal, or you quickly run into enforcement problems with the First Amendment.

So is it social pressure? That's seem to be all that it can be. And that is almost by definition lacking in consensus. But if there is consensus, like: Black people are worse than white people simply because they are black, can't a position win?

We value the free market of ideas *in search of the truth*. If it leads us to that truth, why tolerate the falsehood? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree. The will of the people - as a whole - is best expressed during a Presidential election because everyone gets to vote for the candidates. There are 435 House races and 33/34 Senate races during each midterm election; it is hard to determine whether voters in those races were voting for or against any person other than those in each race (such as the President).

The recent election was certainly a Republican win. But it did not represent the will of the people as far as the President's policies are concerned nearly as well as the 2012 election did. </TEXT>

Source? At least in the United States, it refers almost exclusively to government attacks against speech.

Edit: How would a private right of free speech even work or be enforced? If I disagree with someone's racism and therefore refuse to do business with them, am I to be somehow forced to do business with them so as not to violate their private freedom of speech? Wouldn't that then be a violation of my First Amendment rights if the government stifles my speech to protect the speech of another? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Freedom of speech is a concept which can be extended to anyone trying to suppress speech.

Is it though? At least in America, it almost exclusively refers to the First Amendment version, i.e., no *government* interference.

I'm not really aware of any generally accepted concept of free speech that holds everyone should be allowed to say anything without repercussions from private individuals.

<TEXT> That's like saying if you are pro-Second Amendment, you are pro-forcing-people-to-become-gun-makers. In reality, there will likely *never* be a shortage of doctors or gun makers to that extent as long as a functioning society exists (because of market forces).

Do you not recognize the racial problem in our justice/political system? Because acceptance of that fact is Step 1 in this discussion.

As for your last point... did you hear about the rioting and looting at the Pumpkin Festival up north, and all the hooligans who were arrested, and shot and killed? </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of the major problems with the whole Ferguson situation is that the elected officials don't reflect the community.

So, yes, vote. Use the ballot box and elect your leaders.

This strikes me as FOXNews playing the race card race card. If you don't think there is an issue with race in this country (particularly between law enforcement and African-Americans) you just aren't fucking paying attention. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actual gay uncle with no kids checking in. It may well be more of an individual proclivity and not a in-born thing but I do have a very strong desire to support by brother's and sister's children in any way possible.

Whether I have kids myself is still an open question. But until I do, I try to divert my resources their way as much as possible.

I suggest it may be an individual thing because I love both my siblings. Were there bad blood, the desire to help their children may not be there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Um, no. Way to let hyperbole completely take attention away from any validity your point may have.

The Commerce Clause + the Necessary and Proper Clause do vest the federal government with broad authority, but not absolute authority.

The intent was to give the national government a level of authority over the national economy. Naturally, if the national economy grows, so will that authority. </TEXT>

To bring up an example you used elsewhere in this thread...

There is zero practical difference between the government telling me to keep $20 more of my income and the government taxing me as usual but sending me $20. It reduces the amount of money in the government coffers exactly the same (and increase my money exactly the same).

Whatever amount of money you got to keep because you took the student loan interest deduction can just as easily be viewed as a check from the government. </TEXT>

Shall property owned by the University System of Georgia and utilized by providers of college and university student housing and other facilities continue to be exempt from taxation to keep costs affordable?

I am extremely skeptical of the privatization trend and was shocked to learn that this seemingly innocuous proposal was part of a larger dorm-privatization plan.

I'm voting "No". </TEXT>

And you don't need unique letters for each person, just succeeding letters: 1st inquiry, 2nd inquiry, etc. And probably after the second, a valid response would be "My position hasn't changed since the last letter." Hell, even that would be better than sending the same letter the second time.

<TEXT> Does it though? I assume this is the source of your claim:

The medieval town is mainly famous for its stone bridge over the Danube, built between 1135 and 1146... To complete the construction of this bridge, Roman workers counted on Bavarian sausages to keep them going.

Sausages were sold there at that time but there isn't any indication that sausages have been sold there continuously since 1146. And even if they have been, it doesn't seem that it's been the same business:

The recent owners of the restaurant purchased it in 1806 from the Regensburg State authority.

It's an impressive building for sure and it may have been used only as a sausage restaurant when actually in use, but there is nothing in the article to really support the claim that there has been the same business there for 900 years (which is what the title claims). </TEXT>

<TEXT> My boyfriend had a notification card in Keep this evening (the web-version ones that pop up to explain new features and you click "Got it" to close). It said that you can now share Keep notes and specifically mentioned editing among family and friends.

Unfortunately, we didn't think to do a screenshot and now we can't find _anything_ about it. Has anyone received that notification? Any word that this is actually in the pipeline? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, /r/charleston! My boyfriend and I are planning a quick one night visit and are looking for a nice bed and breakfast. Suggestions?

We are looking for something secluded and preferably on the water (marsh, coastal seaway, ocean). Relaxation is our goal so being near nightlife is not important. Oh, and gay-friendly is a must.

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-05-23 19:00:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Dear [test_subject937],

Thank you for contacting me about net neutrality.

I oppose any form of censorship or discrimination. I believe those who pay for our web capacity must be able to recover their costs, or it won't get built.

Supporters of net neutrality argue that giving all internet users the highest speed and greatest volume of space available - whether or not they contribute to the cost of building that capacity - is the only way to guarantee that no one will be discriminated against on the basis of what they want to say. However, there is very little incentive for carriers to build infrastructure if they have no way to recoup their costs. Without such an incentive, many new high bandwith applications, such as medical technology and communications for emergency personnel, many not be feasible.

Simply put, I believe providers shouldn't be able to block access to any other providers on the basis of content, and access to the capacity that has been built by the public should be open to the public on equal terms. But, access to future capacity should be open on equal terms to those who share the cost of its construction.

Thanks again for caring enough to get involved, and please don't hesitate to contact me again in the future.

Sincerely,

John Barrow </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For one, it assumes household finances are analogous to government finances. And it tells us _nothing_ important (because it's a low bar we all meet - to be a functioning adult is to balance a checkbook).

Is there a way that it is/can be used that is not a cop out? In my experience, it is usually said by someone who doesn't want to be tied to the social platform of the Republican party, but more so doesn't want to be thought of as a liberal or a Democrat.

I've thought this for years and am genuinely curious that I am missing something. </TEXT>

We approached them and they asked what we were up to. We showed them the phone and explained that it is a global game of capture the flag created by Google. That simple explanation dropped the tension level down dramatically (they didn't know what they were walking into until then). 

They laughed and checked it out a bit. Told us not to get "attacked" ourselves, and went on their way. 

Overall, it was a good experience. We told them that they might start seeing more people like us and it's just a game.  </TEXT>
