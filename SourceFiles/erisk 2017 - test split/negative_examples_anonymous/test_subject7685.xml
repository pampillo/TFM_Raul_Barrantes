<TEXT> I like to fly low to the ground and close to buildings, you can't beat the situational awareness of 3rd person IMO. If you're in VTOL mode trying to nail enemies first person doesn't cut it unless they're far away. When in air to air combat I can always get a better view of my opponent looking around with the right stick in 3rd person than I do in 1st person. By definition the 1st person view limits your range of vision compared to 3rd.

At least that's how I see it. </TEXT>

And so I keep forgetting about later MK games being released in the arcades.  </TEXT>

Including a playable Noob Saibot (my introduction to him), Rain's first appearance, and even various kostumes for some characters.

With Kano you could play as the MK1 or MK3 versions. Kung Lao MK2 or 3, Raiden (or Rayden back then) as MK1 or MK2 and some others too. The old versions were updated with kombos and shit.

MK Trilogy was to UMK3 what UMK3 was to MK3, simply a better version with more characters. This is why I'm always confused when people express love for UMK3 like it's the best version of the klassic MK games.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why do people keep hailing UMK3 as the superior classic MK when MK Trilogy was a thing? It introduces brutalities (unless I'm mistaken) and you could play as fucking GORO, KINTARO, MOTARO, AND SHAO KHAN!

I was disappointed to find out that Reptile's slide doesn't go under projectiles. Sub-Zero has always been my main you see, and I'm used to being able to close distance when the enemy uses projectiles.

Just googled Reptil buffs and found this comment:

"Lol, I just checked the notes. He got NERFED if anything. Nerf to his nimble combos due to 4 having lower damage, buff to his absolutely pointless strings that no one uses. The only buff that matters is overhead doing 2 more damage but that doesn't affect him a lot exactly. Wow."

Can you confirm? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Or it was just that the zombies mode had very little story until BO2. It was mostly fan speculation that eventually became canon. Zombies was made in a rush as a direct response to horde mode in Gears 2, so they didn't have time to make a story. The game came first, then the story followed.  </TEXT>

And no option to buy Revenant Sub-Zero or Revenant Jax without buying the 850 souls pack? There's a decent amount of kontent in this update to be sure (althought the challenges they speak of aren't here) but wow, making everything so expensive is a real good way to... ah whatever. Everything's been mega expensive in this game since launch anyway so whatever.

Anyone else notice they didn't mention the fact that the gold kombat pack is now more expensive as well? It's back up to the original 150 souls. Gotta squeeze that money out of us somehow I guess. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good isn't subjective though. Quality of a product is objective. Too few people realise that something you like and something that's good aren't always the same thing.

Example time.

I don't like Coldplay's music, but I recognise that they are in fact a good band.

I like one or two of Dizzy Rascal's songs, but I don't think his music is technically good.

See?

if a few million people think it's good, that probably makes it good

Nope, that's the appeal to popularity fallacy. The amount of people who like something has no bearing on the actual quality of the product in question. Millions of people (myself included) love McDonald's food, that doesn't mean the food is good, far from it, the food is bad, but we still like it.

Conversely, millions of people HATE iPhones, that doesn't mean iPhones are bad, on the contrary, iPhones are pretty fucking good compared to most phones on the market.

So you see, quality isn't subjective, but how people feel about a product is.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah. People en masse love to eat up shit in large quantities. Look at crap like X Factor and The Apprentice. The number of people who like something has no bearing on the quality of said product. If you think the only factor of success is quality of the product then you're mistaken. The right marketing can sell shit just fine.

I think I've gone too far now. I don't think Kanye's music is all shit, that would be unfair to say. I can definitely say his music isn't for me, and I can definitely say that I prefer most of my music to his, but then I'm slightly biased so that doesn't mean much.

But I can say with certainty that I believe his music (and his shitty attitude) don't justify his success. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I woulnd't pay the money for one, mine was a 30th birthday present. It's just cool. I love the way the screen is blank until you raise your arm to check the time, then it lights up. Also being able to create and send text messages/hold phone conversations using your watch is futuristic as fuck. Joe 90/Jetsons futuristic.

Plus I've still not seen anyone else wearing one, so I guess the exclusivity is nice, if you're into that sort of thing.

The watch is also basically a remote for your phone. If there's any video or audio playing you can play, pause, or skip tacks using the watch.

When I'm walking down the shops I can put my headphones in and just say to my watch "Hey Siri, play Muse" and it'll do just that. Or just saying "Play random music" is pretty cool too.

If I'm playing games and I get a text I might miss it because I use a gaming headset, but with the watch I don't miss texts because I get a subtle tap on the wrist telling me I have a notification. I can then glance at my watch and read the message without having to pick up my phone, unlock it, then read.

If you're in a quiet place the voice recodnition software is flawless, easily the best I've ever used. Outside in the city, well, you might as well text on your phone.

Overall I wouldn't say they're quite worth the asking price, yet. More apps are being developed daily, but like I said, mine was a birthday present and I love it. One word to describe the Apple Watch, cool. </TEXT>

As for a "horrible" battery life. I always took my old watch off every night and put it on my bed side table, I do the same with my smart watch, only now it rests on a charging stand. The battery life is not an issue. </TEXT>

And you mentioning technical limitations takes us back to my initial point. If the game has to be crippled mechanically because it's being released on a hand held then maybe just make it a console game and fully realise the glorious vision, and save the hand held for some non canonical game like MGS Acid.  </TEXT>

My point is they could have replaced Hayter with anyone and it would have been worse, because Hayter's voice is Snake's. It's like if Dan Castellaneta was dropped from the Simpsons cast and was replaced by someone who did a voice that sounded nothing like Homer's. Change an iconic voice and I lose all connection to the character that had been built up over the years. </TEXT>

Sure they released it later on consoles but it was still a shitty mobile game, one that I didn't bother finishing because it was such a step back from the previous games. They could have made Acid 2 and 3 for all I care, I wouldn't have been missing out on a brand new fully featured sequel to (at the time) my second favourite game.  </TEXT>

Graphics

Cutscenes

Story

Characters

Shooting Mechanics (ok, they were better than in MGS 2, I'll admit that)

Incredibly tedious base building

Story separated into individual missions like an arcade game

Lack of any cinematic feel

Weird boss fights set in obviously-only-existing-to-support-a-boss-fight arenas

I'm sure there's more, but it's been 3 years since I played PW and I don't remember it all that well. I don't think there's any aspect of PW that improved over previous entries.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got Peace Walker with the HD collection on PS3 and was hugely disappointed, worst MGS game I've played.

The way the story was presented was a joke. No actual cutscenes (something the series is famous for) and instead they gave us shitty scratchy line scribbles, thanks Kojima. That totally ruined the whole experience for me. Then the gameplay was pretty shitty too. Coming off the back of the amazing MGS3 I was so happy to finally, after years of thinking I'd never get to play it, play PW. And wow was it a step backwards. You can say "But it was a PSP game so you can't expect much." or something like that, and to that I say they shouldn't have made a PSP MGS then, if it's going to literally be a step back in the series in every respect.

Did not finish, read the story on the wiki, probably won't go back to it, bad MGS game IMO. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I missed him the second I started playing Ground Zeroes.

Snake is dead, this is as bad as when they changed the actor who played John Connor from T2 to T3. Can't connect with the character, or rather I should say the connection has been severed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wasn't he trying to escape the "honour" of the title Big Boss because of his mission in MGS3? I figured he went back to being called Snake because it was his "name" before he **[MGS3 SPOILERS]** killed The Boss. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  It seems like a lot of the ideas they're expanding in MGSV were ones that started off in peace walker.

Probably because MGSV is a sequel to MGS Peace Walker. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know very little of the situation. For obvious reasons they're not discussing the details of the firing.

From what I can piece together from the backs of packets of mustard it seems people are more upset about the way the firing was handled (or not handled), rather than the firing itself. They have no notice to other mods or something. I think this is just the latest in a long list of reasons people have to hate Ellen, someone is not heard of until the previous debacle happened.

Luckily I'm currently down the Winchester having a nice pint waiting for this to all blow over.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> They really do. The amount of detail is much improved, there's way more foliage and the grass isn't just a flat blurry texture anymore. Most notable though is on the PS4 version the city doesn't struggle to load when you're going mega fast, on the PS3 version that was common place. And the frame rate is usually a steady 30fps on the PS4 version, the PS3 struggled to reach even 30.

Long story short the PS3 was barely powerful enough to run GTAV, and that was with low detail compared to the PS4 version.  </TEXT>

Also, each Half Life game that was released pushed the boundaries of what FPS games were capable of, and pretty much set the standard for the genre when they were released. The games might not be what the masses consider to be fun or exciting (although they are), they're technically groundbreaking games. This is why people want Valve to make another one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The whole false bravado thing they have going on.

"Look at me! Look at how rich I am! Look how much weed I smoke! Look how I wield my AK! Look at my car! Look at those shiny wheels! Look at all these hot women I paid to be in my video! Look at my comically over sized clothes! Look at all this jewelry I wear! Look at how much of a big hard gangster I am!"

Then watch them go home and be told by their wife they're not allowed chicken, so they have to send their assistant out to get it on the sly.

I find the whole thing to be a cringe worthy joke, the fact they take it so seriously only adds to the hilarity. I have no interest in listening to something that musically is extremely basic (often to the point of just re-using music someone else made that was already popular), and lyrically is both vapid and a lie.

There are some good hip hop songs, don't get me wrong. I don't think it's all shit, just the stuff I've mentioned here. Which seems to be 85% of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's fine. I don't feel like I'm in danger when using reddit. It's just a typical kneejerk reaction to people's freedoms supposedly being oppressed.

It seems a lot of people seem to think that reddit is somehow affected by the US government's constituion regarding free speech. Reddit owns reddit, they can silence whatever they want. I almost cannot believe how much of a big issue is being made over this, and the childish reaction from many redditors just makes me happy that a lot of them claim to be ready to leave reddit. We'll be better off without them.

Also people like to use the slippery slope argument. Whatever. What's the worst thing reddit could to us? Shut down the site I guess, that would be the ultimate form of "suppression of free speech", even though they're stopping people from saying what they want elsewhere.

I guess it depends on what you mean by safe. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  30 used to be the norm

When? I remember Street Fighter II Turbo and Sonic Spinball being 55 back in 1993. That equates to roughly 101 in today's money. Sure most games weren't 55 back then, but some were. I remember the average price of a Mega Drive game being around 40, going up 10 - 15 in 20 years isn't so bad really. Games may technically be more expensive now but considering how little the price has risen since the 16 bit era compared to how much content games now have they've never been better value for money than they are right now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If they found us I reckon they'd observe us for a while, no idea what they'd do after that. They might just leave once they see how primitive we are compared to them. If this is the first planet they've seen with life on it (besides their own) they'd probably either want to interact with us, or they might do the whole "Don't interfere with nature" thing.

My thing is if they've got the tech to get here they'd surely have the tech to remain hidden from us, and they certainly wouldn't come all the way here to just crash like some people think, they'd be pretty inept aliens if they did that.

Sure there's some unexplained sightings, but they're just that, unexplained. Most sightings have been explained as being something like a plane, weather balloon (cliche I know) or just strange lighting. I think the time to believe aliens have visited us is when there's good evidence to support it, not anecdotal heresay and footage which can be easily manipulated digitally. </TEXT>

Yes they do. People see things in the sky that they can't identify, some people think it's alien ships, I think they're mistaken.

There's so many things these people could have seen, at the end of the day they saw a UFO, the U meaning unidentified, meaning they don't know what it is, jumping to conclusions that it's aliens is silly.

I don't believe anyone has seen aliens visit Earth. I believe aliens exist, but not that they've been here. Based on the fact that we KNOW people lie, and we KNOW people are prone to being mistaken, and we KNOW our senses are easily fooled, and we haven't seen any verifiable evidence of aliens being here, I don't believe people who claim to have seen alien space ships have actually seen alien space ships. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Serious] Why are the Transformers movies pretty much universally hated? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-09 09:06:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I like the Transformer films, you know why? Because I like the Transformers, and I sometimes like to watch mindless action. People shit all over Bay's films because he likes to blow shit up, sometimes I want to see shit get blown up. There's always room for Whiplash, Birdman, The Theory of Everything. But there's also room for Transformers. Obviously the human elements of those films always suck balls and should be dropped from all future Transformer films, but I for one love watching giant robots beat the shit out of each other, and frankly I'm amazed that seemingly no-one else does.

How odd.

Transformers 2 is the obvious exception, that film can go die somewhere. </TEXT>

I was standing in line with my Xbox 360 preorder but changed my mind to PS3 when my friend finally told me he was going to get it. So I picked up a PS3 copy, minus a pre-order, and I still go the blimp.

It's not a post made to ahdere to the strict definition of the word expendable.

<TEXT> I agree. With Tanya she has a fatality where she stomps through their midsection and creates a hole just like the one Scorpion's fireball fatality does. Then she stomps through their face and leaves a hole identical to the one Jacqui leaves when she punches through. When Jacqui does that you can see some embers on the inside of the enemy's head, presumably because she used some kind of shot to boost the attack (gunpowder scorches?).

But when Tanya stomps through their face you can also see embers/orange glowing. Just makes it feel a little lazy when you see so many repeated gore effects. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tipping isn't weird, expecting a tip is weird. We understand that American employers like to (and are allowed to) pay their staff fuck-all under the premise that the tips will make their wage fair.

Over here our waiters/waitresses are paid properly so tips are literally nothing more than a bonus. For this reason most people (myself included) only tip when they feel they received service that went above and beyond merely taking my order and bringing me my food. if the waiter/waitress goes out of their way to make my dining experience as enjoyable as reasonably possible I'll leave a tip. Fuck up my order? Any chance of a tip goes out the window.

I should clarify, if I'm in America I'll tip because I understand that it's expected over there. On the flip side, Americans are always welcomed by waiting staff over here because their tipping habits make them seem extremely generous :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Skyrim is my favourite game of all time. I was introduced to the series with the nearly equally amazing Oblivion.

I went back and tried to play Morrowind a couple of times. I hate that game. I hate everything about it. I don't think there's a single aspect I experienced that wasn't done better in Oblivion and Skyrim.

But hey, some people like swinging a sword and having it miss the enemy right in front of them 7 times out of 10, and that's cool, it's not for me though. </TEXT>

Then on top of that there's updates, DLC, "free" indie games, shared pictures and videos. It all adds up.

I've had the PS4 for 2 years and I've had to delete stuff to make room for new games twice, that's appalling IMO. I never once reached the capacity of my Xbox 360 or my PS3 320GB HDDs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with everything you just said, have for a long time. But my question remains. I guess that's the "Greater Good" response in a nutshell. In order for me to agree with you about the problem of evil I first must make the assumption that god follows the laws of logic. and I'm not sure if I can make that assumption. This is why I can't say for sure that he doesn't exist.


Edit: I've just done some reading over at Foxhole atheist regarding greater good theodicies and I have come to this conclusion. If the god of the bible is bound by the laws of logic (and until demonstrated otherwise we have to assume  that he is) then no, he cannot possibly exist.

I guess I'm an agnostic atheist or a gnostic atheist depending on the god in question. Thanks for the education ;)

<TEXT> Fair enough, assuming the god of the bible has the same morality most of us do, which it seems he doesn't.

Can we be sure that what we consider to be evil is the same as what god would consider evil? If god is the supposed author of morality could it be possible that if he does exist, we simply don't see that what he allows to happen is ultimately "good"? God's plan/mysterious ways etc etc.


I can't believe I'm actually arguing for the plausibility of the existence of god.

<TEXT>  That way I don't know if a God exists, that makes me an agnostic

An agnostic atheist, like me. Agnostic and atheist aren't mutually exclusive. You can have agnostic theists and gnostic atheists.

You don't know if an invisible fairy exists
You don't know if an invisible mammoth exists.
You don't know if an invisible whatever exists.
Should we have names like 'agnostic' for all of these ?

Nope, because the belief in any of those doesn't have real world consequences like believing in a god does. There are laws in various countries around the world that are religiously based, or religiously inspired.

I don't see any fairy laws dictating what people can and can't do. 

Nothing can break them.

People who believe in a god would beg to differ.

Believing in God is scientific ignorance

Of course it is, and yet billions of people still believe. </TEXT>

It's reasonable to make a negative claim without evidence until there IS evidence for the positive claim

<TEXT> There's a difference between not believing a claim, and proposing a counter claim.

I don't believe that there's an invisible fairy dancing on your back, but it's possible to feel your back and tell there's no fairy there. If you then say it's intangible and I have no way of detecting it, I can say I don't believe there's a fairy on your back, but I can't prove there isn't, and so I can't truthfully say that there is literally no dancing fairy on your back, because I can't possibly know that for sure because of the characteristics of the fairy in question i.e. it's undetectable.

The same goes for god. If you say "There is no god", the burden of proof is then on you to prove that your claim is true.

God breaks the laws of physics

How do you know for a fact that there exists no being in existence that can break the laws of physics? Can you prove no such being exists? If you can I'd love to hear it. If you can't, then you can't truthfully claim no such being exists.

and has zero evidence of him existing

<TEXT> Well. Someone made a claim, that claim is "God exists."

Have you been convinced that the claim is true? If not, you don't believe. If you've been presented with a claim, the fact that you don't give it any thought doesn't change the fact that you either believe it to be true, or don't believe it.

I agree that right now we can't prove either way whether a god exists or not, but the discussion is still worth having because religion is a large part of many countries, and often can have tangible effects on laws and people under those laws.

You don't have to disprove god to not believe he exists, you simply have to remain unconvinced of the statement's truth. Which I am. </TEXT>

Unfortunately you just made a claim, can you back it up with evidence? Reasonably the best anyone can say is "I don't think there is a god." Outright saying "There is no good" places the burden of proof onto you, and if you can be sure there's no god then you must have some pretty compelling evidence.

This is strange because I've reach rank 50 with 3 factions so far, and it took this long to unlock him? Weird.

Yes if paired with possessed kenshi

What makes the pairing so good?

<TEXT>  You know what they're going to do every single time, and you can beat it easily

As Sub Zero I always have trouble with Full Auto Jacqui machine gun spammers. Sure I can slide, but I need to make it perfect to avoid all the bullets, and that's hard. Sure I can use an EX slide, but then they go right back to spamming. The only way round this that I've found is to duck then quickly step forward and duck again, inching my way towards them. I guess it unnerves them into trying something else and then FFFFFWWOOOOOOOSSHSHHH! slide.

Edit: Downvoted for sharing my experience. Wow, this subreddit continues to display itself as the most hostile one I've been subbed to thus far. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whoa whoa now, take it Eazy-E. There's no need 2-Chainz the subject like that, and that's the way it is. I wouldn't expect anyone to Bow Wow at my feet. When I'm sitting on the Lil Jon like a Big Boi you might mistake me for an Ol' Dirty Bastard, but fear not, that's just the Ice-T treating my bladder like a Flo-Rida, making me need to take a Wiz... Khalifa.

Oh my tired Akon bones. I knew I shouldn't have been testing out my new DMX at the skate park earlier, those things are Common anyway. I think I'll give it up like I just don't care before I Busta hip or something, then my leg would get all Puffy and I'd have to put a really big Ice Cube on it to dull the T-Pain.

I went to see the Dr. Dre for a check up and he told me there'd be a Diddy fee. Which was nice because I was expecting something B.I.G.

50 Cent is all he charged me, as thanks I bought him a 2-Pac of his favourite beer and a sole Eminem, a blue one. He asked me "How Kanye be doing this for me? I'm just working my Method, Man."

I replied "Pharrell the times you've healed me, made me feel better about myself. The least I can do is Snoop around your facebook page, see what beer and candy you like. It's not like I bought you a Gucci Mane bag or anything."

And then I left. I knew he'd be watching every step I take, and every move I make, and I knew today was gonna be a good day.

<TEXT> **What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

I want to play games that look better than on my PS4 (Witcher 3, GTAV, that sort of thing). Ultra settings would be nice but I have no idea how expensive that is, so high would suffice if the cost is over my budget. I'd also like to do some light video editing and rendering using Sony Vegas.

**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

700

**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

I don't know when I'll be buying. I'm looking to get an idea of what I'll be buying since I know nothing about the innards of PCs.

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

This will be from scratch so I guess I'd need a tower, OS, one monitor, speakers, keyboard, mouse. Not sure what else I'd need.

**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

England.

**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

None.

**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

I have no idea. I guess so. I thought everyone overclocked gaming PCs.

**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

"RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL" I don't know what any of that is. I'd like an SSD but they're mega expensive. I'd need at least 2TB of storage for all the games I reckon.

**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

Not yet. Just trying to get an idea of what I need. 

**Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**

I guess I'll need windows. I've got 8.1 on my laptop but I much preferred 7, that metro stuff is just annoying. Is there a benefit to using older versions?

**Extra info or particulars:**

I am a noob. Please remember this when saying things like "Radeon 9500 GTX" and "i7 quad core". </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sure the Xbox One controllers do have a great life span. I know the Xbox 360 did, but then again the tradeoff was that you had to buy batteries and keep swapping them out when they need charging. With my PS4  I have a dock that holds two controllers. When one gets low on power I simply turn it off, place it down, pick up the other one and keep playing. I will agree that the battery life on the PS4 controllers is embarrassingly short, but 4 hours is doing it a disservice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's almost as if the stuff bundled with collector's editions of games is cheap tat!

I remember when my Mum opened her collector's edition of Elder Scrolls Online and pulled out the statue of Molag Bal. A statue we'd assumed would have been made from metal given the price of the fucking package.

NOPE.

It was cheap as fuck plastic. I've heard the same from people with other collector's editions. This is why I don't buy collector's editions. Mostly because I don't want the shit that comes with them, I just want the game, but partly because I've been nothing but underwhelmed with what I've seen so far.

Did anyone get the collector's edition of Black Ops with the RC-XD? Or the CE of Modern Warfare 2 with the night vision goggles? what was the build quality like on those? Also the Scorpion statue with MKX. </TEXT>

Sounds like your controller was broken mate. I can usually get pretty much a full day of gaming done on one charge, and I don't dim the light bar at all. I guess the amount of vibrating the controller does plays a big part, but since I play GTA Online and Mortal Kombat X the most these days I'd say my controller vibrates a lot.

Yeah, because it's the best way they can get people to buy their games on steam since games on steam are so cheap they can't possibly charge full price for it. The market is willing to part with less cash per game than the console market. I guess that's the crux of my argument. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  AC Unity (a flop in many ways) and Far Cry 4 haven't been more than 40% off (35.99) on Steam, for example.

Maybe I was exaggerating a bit, but I'm willing to bet that's still cheaper than they've ever been on consoles when bought brand new.

I once saw a collection of 5 GTA games for something like 30. That blew my mind. I've been told many times that PC games are so cheap on steam they actually offset the massive cost of the hardware, the the point of PC gaming actually being the cheaper option in the long run. That's some cheap games right there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you don't mind paying 45 quid for console versions, you shouldn't mind paying the same or more for better PC versions.

I disagree. I'm ok with paying 55 (current average price of a new game) on console because I don't have an alternative. If I switched to PC gaming I'd definitely take advantage of the low low prices PC gamers enjoy.

The sales on PSN and XBOX Live pale in comparison to the sales on steam. I don't recall ever hearing a console gamer saying "I have 200 games in my backlog", but it's a relatively common PC gamer quote.

I'm not saying that consoles don't do anything that could potentially harm profit of games such as sales, but that we're constantly being told how much cheaper games are on PC. I'm routinely told that games are so cheap on PC that it offsets the massive cost of the hardware and actually turns out to be the cheaper gaming option in the long run, the game are that much cheaper.

As for used games, I feel this argument is negated by the PC pirating argument. They cancel each other out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  like Starcraft II, with 6 million units sold, which compares well against Gears of War 3's 6.3 million).

I'm willing to bet that Starcraft II had the benefit of being in steam sales, which are known to knock up to 95% of a game's price off. Compare that to Gears of War 3 where the vast majority of copies sold likely went for full retail price or close to it. While the number of units sold is comparable, the price of each unit sold could possibly vary wildly between the two games.

I'm just speculating here but I bet the 6 million copies of GoW3 made way more money (not including dlc or microtransactions) than starcraft II did. Of course I could be totally wrong. There's a lot of assumptions being made here. I guess the point is, games are way cheaper on PC, and therefore don't make as much money, and therefore don't allow devs to get a bigger budget for the next game as much as console sales do. </TEXT>

I'm not sure what you mean by this. Are you saying they save money because they don't have to put the game on a disc?

More sells in general

There may be more sales on PC but the games are selling for way less than people pay on consoles with all the constant steam sales going on.

Five GTA games for 20? Yeah, console gamers have to pay a little bit more than that. </TEXT>

Boon says a lot of stuff that turns out to be just lies though. I take what he says with a pinch of salt these days.

That said, he's tweeted multiple times "The Rain falls when he may". So, guessin gis all we can do I guess. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  They recode/port games to consoles

What about all the games that are ported to PC? It's it 50/50? aren't there just as many ports either way? Also PC games are usually only 5 or 10 cheaper than the console version. Steam sales make games as little 10% of the price of an average console version. PC gamers give developers less money than console gamers, I mean a lot less. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is an excerpt from an interview with Marcin Iwinski from CD Projekt Red.

"If the consoles are not involved there is no Witcher 3 as it is," answers Marcin Iwinski, definitively. "We can lay it out that simply. We just cannot afford it, because consoles allow us to go higher in terms of the possible or achievable sales; have a higher budget for the game, and invest it all into developing this huge, gigantic world.

Finally. Listen up PC Master Retards. I know PC gaming is king, anyone who disagrees is an idiot. But the next time you give us console gamers shit because our systems are "Holding back gaming" and "Necessitating the dumbing down of our precious games" Just remember that a fucking huge chunk of the money given to developers from the sale of their games comes from us console gamers. Those precious steam sales you always brag about, the cheapness of the games you're always boasting about, they're not doing the devs any favours.

So the next time you bitch about console gamers ruining your games, just know that without us you wouldn't have half of them at all.

Now let's all get along for fuck's sake.

<TEXT> The multiplayer in RDR had some great ideas, but god damn was it one of the most broken online experiences I've ever had. Sometimes it would be cool, you'd posse up and do gang hideouts. Never really got into the competitive stuff because of the aforementioned brokenness.

And by brokenness, I mean invisible people on bulls that slide along the ground, missing any kind of animation, and being killed by mystery people constantly.

I would rate the single player of RDR a perfect 10/10, and I don't bandy 10/10 very much. But I would give the multiplayer a 3/10 because of how broken it was for me. It would be 1/10 but they had some really cool ideas hidden in there. </TEXT>

But after a while of having people kill you for no reason you really start to lose the will to be friendly. These days I will immediately murder anyone who gets what I deem to be too close. I won't think twice about blowing their car up. I use to worry about paying for their car, now I see it as a minor inconvenience.

About a year ago I became the thing I hated most when playing GTA Online, and I make no apologies. The small amount of bastards in the game have slowly turned everyone else into a bastard. </TEXT>

What pissed me off the most was that people were complaining that it's sexist. Saying it portrays women in a negative light. While it does portray women in a negative light no-one was talking about the fact that they has almost identical ads with men on them. But because they were portraying men in a negative light it's not seen as sexist.

Fucking double standards. </TEXT>

Over 42 days spent in GTA Online, I've done pretty much everything there is to do in Los Santos many times each, it'll be nice to have a reason to go back there.

Unless the content they're talking about is just more jobs, most of which I'll never play (capture etc etc). Fewer jobs and more missions would be nice. And I mean missions, not just:

1. Go here.
2. Grab this.
3. Take is here.

<TEXT>  But hundreds of thousands of experiences, if not more, can't ALL be attributed to mental illness or mistake

Yes they can. Of course they can. Why do you think they can't all be explained by natural means? That's like saying 2 billion people can't be wrong. Yes they can! you just made the appeal to popularity logical fallacy.

The number of people believing something has absolutely no bearing on whether or not it's true.



some of those somethings have been captured on photographs and video

And yet not a single one has been confirmed. Not a single account of anything supernatural in the history of mankind has ever been confirmed as being true. That's why the default position on supernatural occurrences is to not believe it until it's been demonstrated to be true, which is why I don't believe, because every single claim of the supernatural has failed to meet it's burden of proof. 

 It would be better to assume it exists and try to quantify it, than to assume it doesn't and ignore it

But people aren't ignoring it. People are doing real scientific tests (and have been forever) to see if such things exist. People will always test for those things. BUT UNTIL THERE'S A GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE THEY EXIST THE DEFAULT POSITION IS TO NOT BELIEVE A CLAIM. Sorry for shouting but that's the most important part. There is no good reason (word of mouth is not a good reason) to believe ghosts exist. People are looking for them, they will continue to look, but they've found nothing.

If ghosts were even half confirmed it would be the biggest news in the history of mankind. Make no mistake, people are looking, but they've found nothing so far. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been doing the souls exploit to be able to have multiple attempts at the test your luck and daily objectives. I notice there's a reward rank for the test your luck and it goes up each day, unless I do the souls exploit, then it resets. My question is this. Is it worth letting the reward rank rack up? I remember a similar thing on Injustice Mobile but the rewards were a joke, even after hundreds of consecutive days. Should I hold out for great rewards or just say fuck it and keep cheating? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I'm fighting... some tower. the last one in the Kove looking portion of the map. Was it really too much to ask for them to label these things? Regardless.

I'm on fight 4/6, and it's cheap IMO. Firstly I'm forced to use a card I don't own. This annoys me because it messes up the equal levelling I used to go for in Injustice, but I can live with that. The trouble is Cassie's passive. It claims "All Spec Ops teammates have a 25% chance of unblockable attacks." And she's teamed with 2 Spec Ops cards. I don't believe the 25% part at all. In my experience 3 out of 5 attacks they do is unblockable, and this is all 3 characters remember. So I've breezed up to this point, but now because I can't use my own team (and the passive benefits that provides) I need to bring two cards that are wildly OP in order to finish this battle. When you're stripped of your team passives and the ability to block while the computer has both of those advantages the fight is insanely cheap.

The rampant and unpredictable difficulty in the fights in this game need to be addressed. You can be going along just fine then BAM! They give you a fight that's in a different league from the ones that preseded it in the same damn tower. If this was a boss battle I could almost be ok with the cheapness, but it's just fight 4/6.

Cheap. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Now the game's been out for a couple of weeks, what's the consensus? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-28 11:58:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I must say this game doesn't disappoint on the whole. Sure the multiplayer suffers from lag, but the lag seems largely consistent so I can usually work around it. Certainly no worse than MK9 and Injustice as far as I can tell.

The graphics are awesome, not the best I've seen, but definitely "next gen", which is something we've seen too little of since the consoles launched IMO.

Sound design. Top notch! I know they put a lot of work into the sound for the game and it shows. All the right crunches and whooshes are there.

Story mode. The best story mode in any fighting game I've played. Worth playing just for the cut scenes. I'm glad Netherealm put so much time into what is now a largely ignored fighting game mode. I love the fact that as well as each character having their own unique arcade mode ending there's a singular canon narrative to play through that solidifies everything story wise.

Music. Can't complain. It does the job, reminds me of MK9.

Krypt. I think this is a fun way to unlock stuff in a game, best krypt so far IMO.

Basically I'm loving this game more than I was hoping I would. I only have a couple of gripes, but they're small and easily ignored when looking at the game as a whole.

1. No Noob Saibot. My mains are always Sub-Zero and Noob. At least Sub-Zero's good in this game.2
2. Sub-Zero's defaiult costume is ugly as hell! But there's plenty of good ones and the inclusion of the Klassic skin made up for the poor Kurrent one.
3. I miss the avatrs from the old KoTH mode. But oh well.

What do you guys think of the game? </TEXT>

At this stage I think I actually prefer the "buy characters for a ridiculous amount of gold" system they used in Injustice. At least with that system I always felt like I was earning currency to go towards characters.

I suppose factions will include some way of earning souls. Whenever they actually manage to make it work that is. </TEXT>

I mean, I know bosses are meant to be tougher than their henchmen but when you can simply breeze through 6 or 7 fights then all of a sudden hit a wall you can't get past until you seriously upgrade your cards, that's surely an issue? Is there any particular reason (other than to try to hassle you into buying microtransactions) why they would do this? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was expecting this game to be at least as fun as Injustice but from what I can tell so far it's. It's not even close.

The animations look sloppy in the MK game. They look like they were animated by amateurs. The animations on injustice were crisp, clear, and just better looking, they flowed more realistically. 

I call bull on the control scheme. I was told that like Injustice if you tap you get a weak combo and if you swipe you get a heavy combo. Well, so far tapping and swiping have done nothing but activate the same two combos. There's literally no difference between tapping and swiping, meaning that when I tell my character to attack I have no idea what he's going to do. Is this a problem with the game or jut my version? I'd be interested in hearing.

There's so many other little things that injustice did right that MK mobile just does wrong. It's like this game was made before injustice.

How do you evade specials that involve throws? Seems awfully cheap of you can't do the equivalent of blocking them like other specials.

I was expecting something so much better. I was expecting injustice with MK characters. What I got was what genuinely feels like a cheap injustice knock-off. And I don't know how they managed to do that.

I'm still playing the game obviously, I'm having to rely on blind hope that the game actually improves and begins to feel good to play, but if what I've played so far is any indicator of how bad this game is to play, then I'll have to be out, and I don't want to be out. 

What are your thoughts on the game so far? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is the Batmobile gear useless? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-10 11:34:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My current favourite team is MKX Scorpion, CCBG, and ABB. The gear I use with this team is as follows.

MKX = Bone Spikes, Mark of the Tiger, and Ra's Al Ghul's Scimitar

CCBG = Carbonfiber Mask, Dark Sword, and Nullification Rifle.

ABB = Azarthian Cloak, Icebound Necklace, The Batmobile.

I know I'd be better off using the scimitar on Batgirl as he combo ender does two hits instead of one but I prefer having it on Scorpion.

My question is this. Is the Batmobile gear useless? I play online mode almost exclusively and almost never get any super's charged up. I usually just use my s2 abilities to win the fights, so is the Batmobile useless? Is it really worth it to charge up enough power to use a super (that will do splash damage) when by that point the fight is almost over and the 1 hit super is less effective than the 4 hit s2 ABB does? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I put the work in to get into the top 4% and then like many others my time and effort was turned into a complete and utter waste of time literally overnight. I was down to some shitty bronze level. Did anyone get compensdated for the work they put in? Like at least be given the reward for the rank they were at before the game fucked them over? I think that would only be fair. Or if that's too much work for the guys who make the game how about a good faith prize of 100,000 credits or something? It would really suck if they fucked us over and offered nothing to make up for it. The risk of it happening again haunts me. </TEXT>

There's 15 or so hours left and I'm bronze because of the battle points issue. I'm not playing today, what's the point in giving us an extra 24 hours? WTF can we achieve in that time? Silver? I wish they'd just accepted this season as a complete fail and moved onto a season with a decent reward instead of trying to resurrect this season's corpse for 24 hours. Now I have no reason to play the game for the next 15 hours. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-01-08 08:37:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Why do they allow us to pay for promotion on most cards, but then there's some that can only be promoted if you're lucky enough to get that card again from a certain pack (looking at you killer frost) while others can only be promoted through online challenges? It's infuriating! I have GF Supes, Ares, and KJJ on a team. I have a promotion waiting for Supes as I completed the single player challenge twice. I have to wait for Ares to show up in the MP season again to get a promotion for him so who knows when that'll happen, and KJJ won't be promoted until I manage to get another 60 alliance credits together.

On another team I have Raven, Aquaman, and Killer Frost regime. Raven and Aquaman can be promoted at any time with credits, I like this. But Killer Frost can only be promoted by being lucky enough to find her again in a challenge booster pack, which I have no intention of doing because there's too many cards in there that I don't want to warrant trying to get one specific card from it. This seems like lunacy to me. Does anyone know why they've made it so infuriating to keep teammates promoting in sync? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Who are they and do you rotate characters from team to team?

I've always teamed 3 characters together and stuck with that. I only ever mess up the teams when doing challenges that require certain characters.

I currently have 7 teams in my rotation, they are:

Bronze Team:

Nightwing E7 Lv 47
Green Lantern E7 Lv 47
The Flash E7 Lv 47

Silver Team:

Deathstroke E7 Lv 50
Regime Doomsday E7 Lv 50
Wonder Woman E7 Lv 50

The following teams are all gold:

Regime Superman E1 Lv 50
Batman E1 Lv 49
Regime Wonder Woman E1 Lv 50

Man of Steel General Zod Lv 50
Lobo Lv 50
Red Son Green Lantern Lv 50

Raven Lv 38
Aquaman Lv 38
Killer Frost Lv 38

Blackest Night Batman Lv 32
Luchador Bane Lv 31
Regime Raven Lv 31

Godfall Superman Lv 24
Ares Lv 24
Killing Joke The Joker Lv 24

I don't buy power credits that's why I have so few promoted gold cards.

My next team will be Cassandra Cain Batgirl, who I've already got, and I'm going to team her up with Animated Batman Beyond and MKX Scorpion when they turn up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys. I just tried to buy 600,000 power credits using some itunes credit I have lying around but it seems to have not spent the credit. I can live with this, but the game crapped out on me after it said "purchase complete". I reloaded the game to find I have 1,200,000 power credits. I only wanted one money pack but I seem to have been given two. I did not intend on buying two packs. I want to see if I've been shafted and charged for an extra pack I didn't want. These things are 35 a piece! Is there any way I can see my purchase history? This is an issue. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of the most strangely fascinating films I ever saw was Waking Life.

Blurb:
A boy has a dream that he can float, but unless he holds on, he will drift away into the sky. Even when he is grown up, this idea recurs. After a strange accident, he walks through what may be a dream, flowing in and out of scenarios and encountering various characters. People he meets discuss science, philosophy and the life of dreaming and waking, and the protagonist gradually becomes alarmed that he cannot awake from this confusing dream.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Thoughts after a year of doing Let's Plays </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-04-14 10:21:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys. I've been making Let's Play videos for a year now and would like to share some of my thoughts of my experience.

My channel focuses mainly on story driven let's plays, my oldest and most popular series is Skyrim Roleplay Advneutre where I never break the 4th wall. In addition to this I have done let's plays of The Last Of Us (no commentary), Gears of War Judgment, Max Payne 3, GTAV, Metal Gear Solid 2 HD (no kills, no commentary) and Heavy Rain Move Edition (no commentary). I also make and upload random videos like GTA montages and I used to make the occasional Black Ops 2 video.

As anyone who does let's plays can tell you there's much more to it than simply playing the game with a mic in front of you, which I wasn't expecting when I started. I think I've streamlined my process a lot since I began doing this last year and the general quality of my videos has improved as the months have passed.

I seem to be plagued by inactive subscribers, although this may be due to my upload schedule. I always stayed away from a schedule because I didn't want this hobby to start feeling like work, but realised my subs deserve content at regular intervals. So I started uploading my two current let's plays of Skyrim and Beyond Two Souls at 8pm GMT on Fridays and Wednesdays respectively. This doesn't seem to have helped my view count at all. I suspect that because the majority of my  views come from America I should start uploading videos at USA friendly times, do you think this is a good idea?

I'm disappointed that I have nearly 300 subscribers but struggle to get more than 15 views per video, after a year of doing this I've only made $25. I've considered giving up a couple of times but then I regain the passion for making the videos and carry on. Another thing that bothers me is that people almost never leave comments on my videos. I welcome feedback and always respond to the few comments that do get posted. Oh well, if they don't want to leave a comment they shouldn't feel obliged to I suppose, but it would be nice to have some interaction with my fans so I can humanise them. For the last year they've just been some intangible force.

Anyway that's my experience after one year of making let's plays. Let's hope the second year is more rewarding. </TEXT>

<TITLE> To the Americans of Reddit. Why do so many of you use the word "bring" when you mean "take"? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-07-04 09:33:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I noticed it a lot in Skyrim and have been seeing it all over the web in recent years.

Example:

Boy: I'm off to school Mom.
Mom: Ok, don't forget to bring a packed lunch.

When it should be like this:

Boy: I'm off to school Mom.
Mom: Don't forget to take a packed lucnh.

If you're talking to someone and you're asking them to take something from where you are to somewhere else the word take should be used. If you're talking to someone and you want them to bring something to your current location the word bring should be used. I don't understand the misuse. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm literally angry with rage right now.

I love Gears of War. Easily the best part about it in my opinion is Horde mode. It's the mode me and my mate spent the most time playing in Gears 2 and Gears 3. Now all of a sudden they've removed for some unknown reason.

And to add insult to injury the game is shipping with only 4 COMPETITIVE MULTIPLAYER MAPS!!!!!! Gears 3 shipped with 10 for fuck's sake. I have been lookin gfor ward to this game for so damn long and now my dreams have been dashed against the rocks of bitterness. Sure I'll still play the campaign and a bit of overrun mode and miltuplayer but the main draw is gone.

I know for a fact that if I hadn't pre-ordered this game weeks ago I sure as heel wouldn't be buying it now.

Way to royally fuck things up People Can Fly.

Anyone else disappointed by this news? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I personally don't really mind. Most of my games are on disc but I have a couple of dozen games downloaded from Xbox LIVE and PSN. I would probably be sad when the time comes that games no longer come on a physical medium but I will understand that it's been made redundant. </TEXT>
