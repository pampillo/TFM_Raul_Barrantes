 - Star Wars The Force Unleashed

 - Star Wars Battlefront II

 - Dead Island GOTY and Saints Row: The Third (come together, unfortunately)

 - Bioshock

Please don't comment unless you earnestly plan to play, or going to give the game to someone who will play the games :]

Please redeem/reply with confirmation them ASAP, will PM the codes! I will try to be random in picking recipients. 

Peace! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to be quietly pro euthanasia, until I heard the deeper arguments against it, it's not all slippery slope arguments.

Heard a really smart lady on the radio make some excellent points about how extremely careful you have to be introducing it to a society. 

It actually put me on the fence, i strongly recommend everyone inform themselves of the opposing views and the deeper reasoning. I'm not qualified to argue for or against. But as someone who was default in favour of euthanasia, the opposing argument highlights complexities that can definitely make you think. 

I believe the interview was on ABC RN radio national a couple of months ago.

Think it's this one: http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/religionandethicsreport/the-dangers-of-legalising-euthanasia/6570898

On mobile atm so cant verify if that's the lady I heard. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you think being angry and outraged is going to help people get what they want or make this community better at all though? I think it does both things a disservice.

Shaming tactics or personal judgements don't work, instead of angry videos and angry comments, fueling even more angrier videos and worse comments. Maybe people should focus on a more diplomatic tone for any future controversies. It will get people a lot further. 

There's nothing wrong with calmly voicing disappointment but personalizing this is uncouth.

<TEXT> Can we drop this witch hunt? Obviously no one is going to play ball when part of the critical crowd has actively abused and personally attacked them. It's an unfortunate effect of the outrage machine places like this subreddit actively fuel.

This is the problem with this community and outrage, it gets the absolute opposite of what people want. 

If you want an apology off someone, do you fuel a community to undermine them, attack them, yell at them and make conspiracy theories? Or do you talk respectfully about your disappointment, avoid speculation and stick to principals of mutual respect and kindness?

Godwin's law already broke in the first couple hours of this thread's existence, and people are clueless as to why anyone at the studio might be a little defensive? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually there are a lot of different communication practices that work extremely well, unfortunately they don't happen to satiate egotistical desires (to put down, feel superior etc.) that violent communication entails - this means people are under the false illusion that the only way to solve a problem is to aggressively voice discontent.

Basically, it's clear Gearbox people feel upset and defensive because there have been many people who attacked them personally and viciously. No reasonable person is willing to parley when people are actively fueling a rage machine against them.

AC:M players feel upset because they didn't get the game they believed was coming, based on the ads.

Do you honestly think if everyone had calmly stated their disappointment with the product, without judgement or assumptions over the character of gearbox staff or any other extraneous side stories, that we wouldn't have a better outcome?

Instead, this anger basically built up a bunch of walls and disillusionment with the critical base and now people are angry about that too? 

It's pretty obvious what happens if you get angry and abusive at someone, they are not going to play ball. Just a natural fact.

<TEXT> Is it worth this kind of outrage? Let's not forget people take this tone of argument too far to justify abusive language and that will just make any dev defensive. No apology will come if you attack someone relentlessly, it's not kind or nice. 

Its like 60 bucks. If that money was precious you wouldn't buy before reviews and if it wasn't precious, what's spending more hours of your life angry going to achieve?

At absolute worst, lets not forget some people enjoy the game, a civil note of disappointment would be sufficient along with future caution if you personally believe it's necessary. </TEXT>

You're never getting an apology or whatever you want from any human being if you start abusing them. No doubt gearbox had to endure this because of outrage then too. It's Human nature to not want to capitulate to abusive language - so it is counter productive.

<TEXT> They weren't to know, but there is a lesson here about trying our best to be a happier and more upbeat gaming community. I know I've said some pretty demanding/angry things about Nintendo in the past - this was wrong to do and I've since been more positive and flexible to change/ideas.

I really enjoyed their latest conference, there was always a sense of fun and not taking things too seriously when it came to Nintendo pressers/directs, so maybe we as a community should strive to meet that standard. 

Have fun, enjoy the games we love.

Peace and Love, RIP Mr. Iwata, you did an amazing job :) 3 </TEXT>

<TEXT> The only way to win in war is not to play. I believe the game plays off this concept.

Lets play out the alternative, if you could choose be a "good guy" and not kill anyone wouldn't it detract from the experience?

Walk away cut to credits? A neat easter egg, but most players will take the bad route to see what happens.

Also, the game works best when you don't expect the guilt. Heaps of military games make you kill people thoughtlessly and this game is trying to trap people in that mindset and then turn it on them.

Holy fuck, after Peace Walker too, when The Boss AI accepts peace and this angers Big Boss in that game, here you see him finally accept it.

<TEXT> Yeah basically anything fan service-y (right word yes?) is pretty cringe. That said, I wouldnt mind seeing it even out with:

1. Less scantily clad women
2. More sexualised men

Sexuality in and of itself is not a bad thing. It is bad when the character is an object to the audience and/or is dressed/acts to allure the audience.

Positive example: MGS4 is an ass simulator, and whose ass you looking at? Snakes. (Ignoring the leery camerawork on the women in the game here)

I think the main issue is when women are treated like sexual objects for audience pleasure in games. The game of war ad evokes that, although Kate Upton im sure IRL is a very capable human being.

Snake, on the otherhand, is a fully realized character and also happens to wear skin tight outfit with no shame in his old muscley man body. If that can be conveyed with a woman that would be no real issue to me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see no benefit to starting a witch hunt, which is the kind of thing that happens inadvertedly after these kinds of reviews, especially to smaller devs with no PR, company or fanbase - based on a few kickstarter discrepancies. 

People attributing malice is pretty extreme accusation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They might have got friends and family to chip in? Kickstarter is a complete gamble, I don't feel it has the credence to justify an outrage if you pay money to a kickstarter (an obscure one at that) it's not the same as thinking your buying a finished product. 

In terms of Steam, there are refunds these days anyway. 

This review seems out of place, I am still uncomfortable it was published in this current fashion, given the potential online knock on effects. </TEXT>

<TEXT> People equate honesty in disliking something with being agressive, I see that as a false equation. You can recommend against buying a game without dropping outrage that will inadvertedly spur on a huge audience to make this devs life miserable. 

1 . Ending a review with "Unfortunately I didn't enjoy this game much, especially the character models, which needed more work to scare me. I hope the developer can learn from these points with future games. 1/10" is different from "Oh, and the scary little girl looks shit. 1/10"

They convey different attitudes to the audience.

2 . Jim is a top tier reviewer, there are games with bigger potential audiences that would probably appreciate a review from him more than a small indie dev who probably didnt' expect to get much attention at all. There are knock on effects to doing an anomalous review in this way.

It's a sledgehammer approach the gaming community often misapplies.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> People will use words like "scam" to justify their own torrents of disdain, though. Feeling righteous is the path to actually doing a lot of damage, sadly. His audience could easily take this way too far based off the "feeling" of the review alone.

I also don't agree with the idea that small games shouldn't be criticized, because people have feeling.I also don't agree with the idea that small games shouldn't be criticized, because people have feeling.

Criticism comes in many different forms, and some are more appropriate than others, especially with context. You can say very similar messages in different ways. Obviously no one is saying they can't be criticized, but what about constructive criticism? Why does there have to be a tone of outrage to the review, what does that do to improve the lives of consumers and creators? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jim, when talking about a game he enjoys, is actually the reason I keep abreast of his work. He does brilliant explanations on why he loves something in a game.

Re: Squirty plays, I like them when Jim enjoys the game, when he dislikes it, it sometimes gets out of hand, especially when you see the audience comments afterwards. Even when Jim doesn't use pejorative language, the comments may do it anyway :/

To be fair though, there are some Squirty plays that Jim probably isn't enjoying, but still plays it earnestly and without pejorative language.

I find the whole "honest reaction" thing a bit skewed, though, because while we may occaisionally swear "honestly" at the TV or whatever in our private homes, it's not the same when you broadcast that to an audience of thousands who will then interpret and run with it in numerous, often incorrect, ways. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah look, most people would expect some criticism for any game they put out there (I plan on releasing a game at some point, after all). Unfortunately, with a high profile critic (with a huge audience) and a review that gives it a 1/10 without much context as to who the dev is and the last word of the review being "shit" - well, that's a nuclear strike for a smaller developer.

Consider this: huge companies have had to mobilize huge PR teams to counter Jim's ire and the audience reaction that comes with it.

I dunno, I just feel uncomfortable about this kind of review. </TEXT>

I feel Jim would be happier if he focused on other games instead of finding small games he can tear into. How much of his audience would have played this game? How many are going to play it now and flood the developers page with vitriol because of this review? What will that achieve?

Im worried about the negative aura gaming community is cultivating.

Anyway I really enjoy Jim's work generally speaking, just prefer less negativity. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Really? Cos I've seen videos where she talks about games she likes. Also basically all of her criticisms on youtube start with "it's possible to both simultaneously enjoy and criticize", which is true, not many games are 100% perfect. 

I think people are very sensitive about what she says instead of accepting that like many critics out there she only mentions something if it's a problem. That doesn't = she hates all games. I prefer her positive criticism, of what I've seen, though, but I like positive criticism from most people, negativity is less appealing to me personally. </TEXT>

**Deus Ex Human Revolution** - First person action RPG shooter/stealth game, dialogue options and cyberpunk storyline.
Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-DwoCkpBFA

**Saints Row 4** - Parody/comedy game, follow a bunch of (strangely likable) psychopaths saving the world. Extensively create your own character, pick female or male protagonist with multiple voice options. Game parodies games like Mass Effect, I love ME and this game was very entertaining for me.
Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51OztTj9r5M

**Any of these telltale games** (contains dialogue options, almost like an interactive movie or TV show - not super long and the last two aren't all out yet, gameplay is mostly quicktime events and dialogue):
The Walking Dead S1 2 (will make you cry) - Fan Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIq1bpzxCZw

The Wolf Among Us (neo noir) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_St9DTuO0

Tales from The Borderlands (comic roguish adventure - apparently you don't have to know the previous games, according to friends I have who have played it - I haven't played it yet but heard good things) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Od_savz7A

Game of Thrones (If you like the show) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZeJfIvy3Ck

<TEXT> The beauty of the internet is you can probably find communities and content creators that suit your tastes. 

I personally have misgivings about the very pessimistic and snarky tone the dialogue about this art form has cultivated. I dislike outrage culture very strongly - I feel like that energy could be better spent on actual world problems. Although cordial and polite critique on a variety of issues is absolutely fine. I agree with you about Danny O'Dwyer, but I like him because he's calm, clear and concise. He doesn't beat the outrage drum, and I appreciate that. 

Conversely to you, I actually like many elements of every outlet you mentioned. However, broadly speaking any sort of outrage turns me off, this is supposed to be an artform for discussion, not anger, bitterness or incivility - at least that's how I feel about it.

<TEXT> Sort of, if i could distill it i would say there would be:

1 skill/trait 1-100 for dialogue efficacy
1 skil/traitl 1-100 for combat efficacy
1 skill/trait 1-100 for magic efficacy
1 skill/trait 1-100 for stealth efficacy
1 skill/trait 1-100 for athleticism

None of those stats overlap into other mechanics, but if the game is designed with all those mechanics in mind it makes picking skills more of a "what i want to do" scenario instead of "how do i make my stats balance so my character good at this?"

Skyrim sort of does this, i think. </TEXT>

Yes single skills for gameplay but have so many gameplay elements that upgrading those skills in different combinations and ratios makes it fun.

E.g.

I want to have a stealth assasin so I will put points into combat, stealth, and athletics

I want a stealth ghost so I swap combat for magic, so i can cast invisibility.

I want a wise talking theif? I choose stealth, dialogue and athletics.

Imagine the points directly correlating to how much X Y Z gameplay elements you wabt to engage with.

Instead of having dialogue split up amongst skills reverse it so the skills are split into specific mechanics. </TEXT>

3 traits help combat? not necessary, have 1. Its one clear system.

But maybe theres a platforming system so tie a trait to that.

Maybe there's a dialogue system - another trait.

Make them distinct and related to a single system, then design a game that really interweaves those systems.

Instead of interweaving traits in skills that stack up over one system:

E,g. Combat = int, agi, str, const etc.
Dialogue = cha, int, str, </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hes a tragic villain, but becoming the monster we see hinted at in the games is still becoming a villain. Even Solid Snake didnt see himself as a hero. His father with his PMC and his vendetta against the world that fucked him doesn't make him anything remotely good.

Can't wait to see it unfold though, each game he's gotten worse and worse this is gunna be really fucking sad and horrific. Even sadder when you see what his mentor chose in peacewalker. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Big Boss is turning into the villain though, so it's likely his character arc will make more sense to play more lethally. There may even be forced killing missions??

I'm okay with that given we are playing a character we KNOW is a villain and the series has always said something interesting and critical about war. It's not got the jingoistic tone of say, Splinter Cell Blacklist. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Could you expand on that? I'm aware of that idea that sexualized women + the violence can direct the tone in a really unsettling fashion (e.g. hitman), but does sexualization inherently and problematically tie into violence for every game? Bikini chainmail female warrior fighting a monster, is that sexual violence when compared to a beautiful man in no clothes fighting the same monster?

I'm not arguing the idea, I can feel there's something wrong there but I need further clarification to build my own understanding. 

Thanks :) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Hey /r/girlgamers what's your opinion on "sexualized" equality? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-19 17:23:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Accidently deleted my text in my post, so I have to redo:

If 50% of objectified characters were adult men, in the exact same fashion as the sexualized adult women (not the male idol fallacy, but actual objectification for the straight female gaze, or whatever) would that help the situation of objectified characters?

I should note I'm not talking about third person leery camera movements, I'm talking about design of the character. I don't think anyone really likes cringeworthy camera shots of a boob or bum or a package, but if a character is wearing skimpy clothing and they own it - equally between the sexes, does it become less of an issue?

I understand two wrongs don't make a right, but if we are going to focus on moral issues in games, isn't violence more problematic in that regard? 

I'm a sex positive bisexual male, so I'm definitely not interested in sex and sexuality being a taboo and I don't mind looking at objectified men in games either!, but I am not in the right position to make a clear assessment myself so I'm curious what people's thoughts are on adult characters being treated 50-50 equivelant. </TEXT>

Any feedback on the artstyle or idea is appreciated, just be aware that any feedback may be taken into account in the project, which means anything you post here could be used/appropriated - so if you have any ideas you think are too brilliant to give away for free please keep em to yourself and make your own game because I'd love to play it :)

Basically the game plays like a chose your own adventure/screen based game (maybe like visual novels? I dunno never played one), you have conversations with characters and decide where the plot goes by what the character does and what tale she ends up experiencing :)

I'm planning on having vastly different story threads depending on every choice you make, you could befriend someone or kill them :o - characters could betray you or you may never know their true motivations by the end. 

Because there are going to be a lot of panels, I've chosen a simple artstyle. I may also include a QTE decision system for high pressure moments, but it won't be anything complex, because I don't like complex QTEs.

Would you play this kind of game? 

Edit: wow! thanks for the comments, feedback and upvotes ^_^

<TEXT> "War... War has changed..." vs. "War... War never changes..." It's almost like Kojima wrote that line to challenge the inherent view of our culture's tendency to fetishize violence and revere warriors as mythic things instead of seeing them as people who are mistreated by those in power.

<TEXT> I love how Kojima can use a wildly contrasting tone (camp 60's in this case) and still deliver a really serious and compelling criticism of war.

I love how MGS3 basically shows how soldiers are used and abused by governments for their own ends. There is no king and country bullshit here.

MGS is basically pop culture porn, but it is NOT war porn, something I appreciate greatly in the franchise and in a climate where MANY video games and even similar genres are playing up war as "cool" in a direct and shameless fashion - it's nice to see MGS actually having something to say about the shitty state of affairs our world has become. </TEXT>

It will be a game where you buy and upgrade your space ship, you can leave your pilots seat at any time and board other ships or walk around space stations. You can use a gun and you can also land on planets (cutscene landing?)

If thats right that sounds really good, but will there be a story or is it more of an MMO experience type deal? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Writing is still important but its now become a first step for other mediums. Video content comes to mind (youtube videos like "explainers". Good speaking and imagery is important but the writing underneath is why people keep coming back. Edit: sorry, on mobile </TEXT>

P.s. how did you get into games writing? I'm making my own games currently so I can get some experience writing stories for games. Did you do the same?

<TEXT> Definitely would love to see a Bioshock game that tackles military interventionism, particularly given recent controversies surrounding drone strikes. It can really paint you into a corner when you start creating enemies as a consequence of trying to stop your enemies. If that can be intelligently critiqued I would be pretty stoked.

Along similar lines, I feel systems like the military industrial complex or the surveilance state would also be interesting issues. Metal Gear Solid has already addressed this pretty well already, though albeit in a completely different fashion to what Bioshock could do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, but difficulty is usually a detriment to my experience. Let me explain. 

I like the idea of high difficulty, but it is rarely used with any great effect and instead of adding to the tone of a game, any sense of tension is deflated by the fact that while you may be vulnerable, your enemies are bullet/hit sponge demi gods.

I like the idea of getting hit once and dying, but I need my enemies to have the same vulnerability, otherwise it's an exercise in grinding and not tension. 

So instead, I often play on easy so enemies go down fast but reset to checkpoint if I get hit by a bullet, like a mentally enforced, pretend high tension difficulty mode.

It's annoying, because how hard is it to put in a difficulty mode where almost everything, including you, dies in one hit? </TEXT>

He slaughters those guys in the bar and then uses that conspirator against King Foltest as bait for the striga.
In the games Geralt seems like he has more of a warm heart, does his character change in the books, or have the games made Geralt more sympathetic?
Don't get me wrong, the book is so far really awesome (got the audiobook), it's just interesting to compare and contrast. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So in this game, what are the limitations on freedom? I have never played Elite, but can you land on planets or other ships? Can you get out of your ship? Are any space sims like that?

Or is it mostly UI and flight? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm curious about relatively new/small gaming channels that people on /r/games think are really good or interesting.

I enjoy TB and Dodger but sometimes it's cool to see some less prominent talent on YouTube.

I'll post a couple I found down below, in the effort of fairness. Hope to see some good suggestions. </TEXT>
