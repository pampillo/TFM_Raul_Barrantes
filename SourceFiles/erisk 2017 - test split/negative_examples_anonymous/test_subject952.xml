<TEXT> What level are you? If you are below 20, complete the story, do bounties, play some strikes. Just get a feel for the game and how it operates.

Once you get to above 20, now you grind strikes to get vanguard marks and level up your vanguard rank. Once you get to rank two, you probably have a full set of blue gear that makes you a higher level. You can also buy gear from the vanguard person to make your level even higher. 

We can talk again once you get to level 28-ish. If you have any more questions about the game, PM me and I will try my best to answer them. Also, if you have Xbox One, you can shoot me a friend request to play missions, do bounties, or play strikes/PvP. My GT is 'Moreos'  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do, actually. My dad is a cop since I was pretty little he would take me to the range every weekend. I now have a couple rifles to take with me.

My username was an old Xbox Gamertag. About a year ago when I made this account I couldn't think of anything else so I just stuck with it.

I'm having a "falling out" (I can't think of another word, sorry) with my parents, but I guess that's it.

Lol, that's all I have to say for that one. Yeah, it's *SUPER DUPER* being 13!!!!!!!!1!1!1111

Being able to shave(no, really) everyone else does it, and I grow hella hair.

My school doesn't have a counselor, I dont want to talk to one anyway. Thank you for the kind words. I don't think my dad will do anything physically, he hasn't in a while. The only thing he has done to me was spank, but I think he knows I'm too old for that now. He has threatened once in the past few months, I fear he will go through with it, but deep down I just know he won't. My stepmother threatened to slap me in the face, but I don't even fear her. I just despise her. 

I'm trying to take care, but it's just so hard being the only adult around because my father and stepmom won't. I'm practically raising my little brothers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have tried talking to them... My older brother has as well. When that happened, my dad slammed him into a cabinet. He later moved out to my mom's house. When I tried to talk to them, they just started yelling at me that I have a bad attitude and I got grounded for 3 weeks. 

My brothers wonderful advice was to put up with it and act like I was happy and always have a smile on my face. Then when I turn 13, move out to my mom's house. My brother waited until my dad pushed him (age 17) because he didn't want me to be alone there. But here I am, about to turn 13, and I'm so so scared of telling them I want to leave. My mom knows, she said my dad would take it to court, and we would have to fight. She said we would win, because dad already has lost a son. If CPS has been called before this on him then surely we will win, right? and it's not about the chores; I'm fine with doing chores. It's that the ONLY time they EVER talk to me is to yell at me about them. 

Our family will never come together. You would thing that my bro leaving is a wake up call to them, but it's not. They still think they are the perfect parents with the perfect family, and they will always think that. Some people dont change.

My stepmother acts like she owns me, like I'm an *object*. I don't have real conversations with here either. When I'm at this house, I never talk. Just do chores, mow the lawn, get grounded because I have a bad attitude, and do schoolwork that isn't due for 3 WEEKS. They always yell at me, make me call them Sir and Ma'am.

And I hate them for it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey there, Vault of Glass newbies! Today is your day to get that sweet, sweet loot from VoG. Here's a few things you should have: 

1) Have a microphone, communication is the key to success!

2) Be a level 26 or higher. You can accomplish this by having a full set of rare gear.

3) Have a positive attitude! No one likes that one guy that complains the whole raid. 

Message Jade Sueta for an invite. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Platform: Xbox One

Time zone: Pacific Standard Time

Level: I have two 31 warlocks, and a 27 Hunter.

Game modes: I love everything in Destiny. Raids, Nightfall, weekly heroic, bounties, PVP, anything. 

Mic: Yes

Gamertag: Jade Sueta

I have a few friends that I raid with, but I would always like to have more people on my friends list I can rely on. Even if I have done Crota's End four times this week I will gladly help you out, too. 

As a side note, I am young. I was told I sound like an eight year old boy, although I am not. I am putting this here because almost everyone who I play with will instantly leave when I talk, assuming I'm an immature squeaker. Just a heads up. </TEXT>

I think if you are with people you enjoy and doing a survival, it's like a podcast or commentary or something. It just gives you something to make some money while chatting or talkingabout something with your friends. If you are just going in with random people sitting there in silence while playing, you're gonna have a bad time. ( and 20k on ammo! Do you only play with sticky bombs or something? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have never watched it, but have been planning to. On school days, I wake up at six, walk to school, walk home, do homework, go to soccer, come home, eat dinner, shower , then go night night and repeat. Since I'm on break or on the weekends I visit my moms house the most I can, come home Sunday, go to sleep, play xbox, back to school. Consoles are only allowed on the weekends </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's Dystopian Fiction, which I like, set in the future where the world is split up into five different sections. Just find my xbox live account and my bio will tell you :P. Just read it. I have recommended it to all of my friends, teachers, my mom, and my step-mom. Although my friends haven't read it, 'cause books, everyone I know is obsessed and crystal at the end. It's really intense and action packed with people jumping off of moving trains. But then there's like a pinch of a crush turns into a pinch of a crush for him, but in the last book it WOULD not have turned out the same without him. It's just, amazing. Read it. Pm when your done </TEXT>

<TEXT> Archery is really fun, I read the hunger games and I was like, I wanna try that! But now I don't like archery because of the hunger games I like that satisfying thud when I hit a ten. And I know how reddit has a lot of gross stuff but I only browse sections that are the most appropriate for me. Of course there is that one post on here about penises or something, but in didn't click it!!!!! Eww! And I know no other twelve year old girl that likes video games and the color black, but then there's those idiot guys that are like " OMG I'm a gamer now!!!!! I bought (way outdated game like world at war)!!!" </TEXT>
