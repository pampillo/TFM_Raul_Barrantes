<TEXT> Yes, water usage is a major issue. This study did actually look at the GHG and energy impacts associated with irrigation and water usage. But, you're right, a smaller carbon footprint doesn't immediately put the water back in the ground...even though it may over time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a fascinating depiction of both the resilience of nature in the face of adversity and the significant long-term, unintended, and unexpected consequences of the oil spill.  The uncertainty of the science coming from the oil spill makes it more difficult to accurately portray the magnitude of the impact.  First-hand accounts like these, which cite experts who live and work among the impacted ecosystems, are a valuable resource. </TEXT>

The Pope's [encyclical](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/19/world/europe/pope-francis-in-sweeping-encyclical-calls-for-swift-action-on-climate-change.html?ref=liveblog _r=0) on the environment and an [EPA report](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/23/us/politics/effects-of-climate-change-could-cost-billions-epa-report-says.html?ref=topics) warning of the costs of global warming both came out over the last week.  The Surgeon General's warning is the latest in a series that impress the urgency of taking action to mitigate the effects of climate change. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If this correlation exists, it could serve as a significant economic and social incentive to improve air quality.  Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are long-lasting diseases that require significant investments of time, energy, and money by health care facilities, families, and friends.  Moreover, as the U.S. population ages, these diseases are becoming more common.  In 2015, Alzheimer's and other dementias will cost the nation [$226 billion](http://www.alz.org/facts/overview.asp).   </TEXT>

<TEXT> The influence of infrastructure on human behavior is incredible.  Moreover, it's an important consideration in evaluating the long-term costs of any major infrastructure project.  While protected bike facilities may or may not be profitable at current usage rates, the resulting behavior change could decrease long-term costs by reducing wear and tear on roads and improving general health (through improved air quality and fitness and reduced accident fatalities). </TEXT>

<TEXT> These pesticides provided what was deemed a necessary service at the time of their invention.  Recent research on the potential health effects of pesticides like Roundup and 2,4-D is a good reminder that every product has costs and benefits--and that producers should be as aware as possible of both before marketing the good.  

This is a particularly salient reminder as the world seeks alternative energy sources to replace fossil fuels.  These technologies will have costs and benefits as well, and to make sure they are truly sustainable, their full life cycle must be considered. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is amazing to see the breadth of impacts that climate change could have on the world.  Many of the worst harms will have implications for human health as ecosystems collapse, the incidence and severity of extreme weather events increases, and climatic patterns shift.

This panel follows the publication of the Pope's encyclical on the environment, another landmark report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change, and numerous recommendations and warnings from the US Environmental Protection Agency, all in the last year.  Momentum is building. </TEXT>

A [study by Oxford University](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/08/campaign-against-fossil-fuel-growing) found that while divestment may not have a significant direct financial impact on companies, the resulting social and political stigma can have significant effects.

This dollar value was calculated by performing a 50-year life-cycle cost analysis of white roofs versus black roofs. Regardless of cost savings, this article points out that those who are concerned about climate change "should choose white roofs, which are three times more effective than green roofs at cooling the globe." </TEXT>
