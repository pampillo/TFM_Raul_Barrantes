<TITLE> What icing is best for an ice cream cake that will be frozen and eaten slowly? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-21 20:54:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I made an ice cream cake (two vanilla cakes with some strawberry ice cream in between) and it is currently in my freezer setting up in a spring form pan. I want to put some icing on it and maybe practice decorating, but I don't know what will freeze well. My roommates are gone for another week but there's no way I'm waiting for them to get started on this thing. So my question is what icing will hold up to being taken in and out of the freezer while I slowly devour this cake over the course of the next week or two? Will buttercream be okay? Thank you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a Polar FT4 and after about 7 months of use it started giving me erratic readings (ave hr of 45, max 205 for a steady state day on the water) but I machine wash it once a week and it now works fine. So whatever you buy make sure you wash that chest strap. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A couple of people I know really like them, but I'm not a big fan. The first few times I sculled with them was in bad weather, and it really irritated my wrists and forearms. I had tendonitis in my wrists a couple of years ago, and it felt like the extra effort it took to square and feather started to bring that back, especially in the choppy water. I try to avoid them just to keep my wrists happy but better and more experienced scullers than me really like them. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Any way to increase my body awareness? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm 20yo female who didn't really do any sports until I got to college (I did some swimming in middle school and marching band in high school, but nothing else). I started rowing in college three years ago and now I'm really dedicated and committed to that. But I've noticed on and off the water that I have less body awareness than my teammates. For example, when doing weights I can't tell if my spine is neutral or bent without a mirror or a partner. Are there any exercises--either physical or mental--that I can do to help increase my body awareness? This subreddit seemed like a good place to go but feel free to direct me somewhere else. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you're forgetting the mental skills required for this sport. Yes, all sports require mental skills, but rowing--particularly racing--requires some serious mental focus and toughness. Pushing your body to its absolute limits is not something your brain really wants to do, and it takes time and attention to really hone the necessary perseverance and to shut down that prominent self-preservation instinct. Don't neglect that in your considerations.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It rarely happens, but when it does it sucks. Not only do I feel sore when I move, but my legs just ache. I had chocolate milk with protein powder after I worked out, and then ate an actual meal another half hour later. I am getting plenty of water. I could have stretched more afterwards, but this has happened to me before when I have stretched. I'm a rower and I did some pretty intense and long race pieces this morning in a single. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Society tells us that therapy is for the weak but honestly that shit is so damn helpful. I feel like the typical rowing mentality of "push through, you ARE tough enough for this" is also working against my argument here, but if you really want help, you should try it. I'm a 20 year old lightweight female rower, so I know your struggle, and even if it doesn't work out for you, go to two or three sessions and see what happens. See if your school offers anything. 

Also my 2k PB is a 7:41 when I weighted 132 so maybe we should be friends or something? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> They're pretty anxious because a couple of months ago the varsity team did a 2k and they watched so they could see how intense it is. Obviously that terrified them, and I'd rather they have a little more preparation than just that. Our coaches have told them some vague splits to shoot for and what rating they should be at, but they aren't ready for the mental aspect of it. Anyone have any favorite articles I can share with them to help them get ready for that third 500?

<TEXT> So far we've done two 30' tests and I did worse on the second one, which is why this whole debate started. Since then I've been training with higher splits to keep my heart rate in the right zone (until the end of a piece every now and then). We have our next test tomorrow, so hopefully this will all pay off and I'll be okay.

And I don't feel like I'm killing myself at 170+ but I also don't feel like I know enough about hr zones to say that I'm okay there, because it is tiring but not that tiring. I've only been rowing for 2+ years and I've only been paying attention to my hr for the past six months. I will definitely discuss more with my coaches. Thank you so much! </TEXT>

<TEXT> We use our split from a 30' test +7 for SS. Most people on my team seem to be keeping their hr between 160-165 but mine is 170+. So I've been doing SS at 30'T +9 or 10. It sucks for team SS workouts because people with slower 2ks than me are finishing distance pieces minutes before me. Sometimes I get too competitive and end up pulling too hard and getting my hr above the target zone. My coaches scold me for this because they like lower hrs for SS. But I'm glad you guys are saying it isn't terrible for my hr to be a little higher because my coaches made it seem like a Very Bad Thing.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know what your normal workouts are like but basically yes. And then throw in some extra steady state. So maybe those two workouts and then two days of SS and then weights and whatever other stuff you do, but toned down a bit because you're erging so much. Also these workouts will give you an idea of what to shoot for. Make sure you're negative splitting; it's better for your erg times and your body. 

Also the hardest part about erging is the mentality, so that's probably what you need to work on the most. Even though you know the mental erg struggle, it's been awhile and a 2k is hell. So remember that, and keep your focus while you're erging, especially through the long pieces and the last couple sprint pieces. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You just have to work on erging endurance and the best way to do that is by erging. I'd do some (at least four) 500m sprints and then maybe some 3x1k at like a 28 and definitely some steady state (maybe start easy like 2 or 3x15'0 just to get back into the muscle memory of erging). Don't 2k again for another two preferably three weeks.  </TEXT>
