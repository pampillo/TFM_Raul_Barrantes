However well thought out and logical policy changes are, when applied in such a sudden, sweeping and inconsiderate way it will make employees unhappy.

<TEXT> Watched Despicable Me 2 and The Book of Life.

Despicable Me 2 was adorable and funny. Steve Carell voice acting was on point. It also looked great for its relatively modest budget of $76 million.

The Book of Life didn't appeal to me. The marionettes art style didn't look good. The love triangle was very one-sided. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Muybridge's Strings](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10688/Muybridge_no_Ito) is a short film by the Oscar-nominated Koji Yamamura. Its a parallel storytelling of [Eadweard Muybridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eadweard_Muybridge) life and a mothers life with her daughter. The connecting theme is time. Muybridges sequential photography captures moments in time and in a way the mother desires to do similarly with her time with her daughter.

<TEXT> The director of Inaka Isha, Kji Yamamura, does a lot of absurdist short films. You might like his other films, Mt. Head, The Old Crocodile, and Your Choice. I think his best film is Muybridge's Strings, which is more serious and thematic.

<TEXT> The anime is a major way for Bandai to market the game prior to release. It being delayed to the fall season will severely limit their marketing. ~~It also makes me wonder why Bandai didn't choose Sunrise to do God Eater since they own that studio. They probably thought Ufotable's style was a better fit but I bet some of them are thinking right now that they should've went with Sunrise.~~ Forgot that Ufotable worked on the God Eater games and a bunch of Bandai games and that's why they were hired. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Doubt it. Ufotable strikes me as a studio that would only take projects with a good budget to maintain their high standard of art and animation. They just don't seem to have much experience with juggling multiple series since they usually only make one per year. I'm guessing that inexperience with schedule constraints is what causing the production problems. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Digital Frontier is doing the CG. They did the CG for Resident Evil: Damnation. They also did the CG sections in Wolf Children including the [snow scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGWzwpVBZSE)

Resident Evil: Damnation action scenes:

[Ada Wong VS Svetlana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzPdR1bRtBw)

[Tyrant fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH_JcpyoVho)

Those looked pretty good to me but then again anime series production compared to film production is a different story in terms of budget and time management. That difference being budget and time are more constrained in TV anime production.

To me the more interesting part of this announcement is Digital Frontier possibly doing more CG anime series production. A competition between them and Polygon is good for advancing the tech in CG anime. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Solid 2nd season but not as good as the first which had more tension and better sense of eminent danger. I also would have liked if we got information on the gaunas; their origin and why they're attacking humans. Some details on Ochiai's use of gauna biology to make his come back would've been nice too.

As for the finale, the continuation of the battle was a bit underwhelming compared to the last episode. Maybe the finale would have been better off as being purely a resolution episode. That would also mean condensing all the battle in the 11th episode, which I would not have liked.

The orbital bombardment sequence was absolutely badass and the sound design was glorious.

<TEXT> A natural 220 pounder would be considered a small heavyweight and would rather cut 15 lbs to make LHW. A 200 pounder would cut 15 lbs to make MW instead of fighting 220 pounders cutting down to LHW. Some of these fighters have no choice but to cut weight in double digits since the difference in weight divisions is large. </TEXT>

<TEXT> $250,000 covers a budget of one episode. Maybe two for a really cheap series which Death Parade isn't, judging from its quality.

NTV who owns Madhouse also owns Hulu Japan, so at least Death Parade functions as an original content to their catalog. Original content is becoming more important since Netflix is launching in Japan this fall. So it's not a total loss, but I wouldn't get my hopes up for a 2nd season. Although it would be a very pleasing surprise if it happens.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't use it because of the ghosting. The smoothness is cool for a 1-3 minute scene but I wouldn't be able to stand watching a whole series with ghosting.

Also there's not a lot of actual 60 fps content other than sports broadcast and some porn. The Hobbit trilogy was shot at 48 fps. Most movies and TV shows are 24 fps. A traditional animation TV show is basically 12 fps upscaled to 24 fps with repeated frames.

<TEXT> That was an exciting episode of mostly just action scenes. Being able to convey sense of speed and the frenzy of combat was always this show's signature. I also like how the action can seamlessly transition from a wide shot of the battle to an up-close and personal view of it. There might be better choreographed action scenes out there but in terms of the full package that gets the heart racing this show's action might be the best of all the recent anime.

Some nitpicks: there were a few spots when it got choppy, some in slowmo and others during a few camera moves. There were a couple of Transformer-esque angles and super quick cuts that made things momentarily hard to follow.

<TEXT> I try to keep up with indie anime short films. There's some odd and experimental stuff that are a nice change of pace from the usual.

Most recent one is [The Lost Breakfast](https://youtu.be/rtcH5k2-fLM).

Some are just a simple animation/artistic showcase like [in the Wind](https://youtu.be/GZ39V34qInQ).

<TEXT> Hak going into rage mode was intense.

[This page](http://www.titaniascans.com/reader/Akatsuki+no+Yona/091%3A+He+Was+a+Very+Precious+Friend/#page=25) really expressed the mixture of anger and sadness. The way Yona calmed him down was moving. The last few pages of that chapter were a fantastic mixture of emotions.

I thought we might see Zeno's ability in this arc. A bit disappointed that wasn't the case.

Is the rest going to be anime original? The sequence of events in this episode is drastically different from the LN/manga.

I'm guessing the first two episodes are anime original written by Junichi Sato and Reiko Yoshida. I'm hoping they have more written material waiting to be made into an anime series if this three episode OAV becomes a big hit.

<TEXT> Yuhata is back in the harem game. I'm fine with the harem hijinks as breather episodes and this episode was amusing but three in a row is pushing it. I want to get back to the scheming, action and tension.

Izana's new abilities to control a Garde looks promising. It seems like there's going to be a conflict between Yure and the Captain. 

Maybe it's just me but the animation and overall presentation looked so much better in this episode. Especially the lighting; [construction site](http://imgur.com/a/jPe36#2), [sunset](http://imgur.com/a/5gYxC#0), [morning light](http://imgur.com/a/l4K1u#0) and [Thousand Year Village](http://i.imgur.com/K9mZHBP.jpg).

<TEXT> I think for a lot of these shows the studio is really just a hired contractor. The sales are financially inconsequential to the studio and the ones that either profit or lose money from sales is the production committee that hired the studio and financed the whole project. Obviously the studio wants the show to sell well since it could make them look good and help them land more and better projects but as long as they keep getting new projects then I don't think sales are a be all and end all. That's why Deen, Satelight and Pierrot are still in business.

Also it's not all about disc sales. Some shows are made as promotional material for manga, LN, video games, merchandise and as part of a multimedia project. Additionally, ratings matter a bit more for non-late-night shows. Some of these reasons are also why recent late-night anime like Garo and Rage of Bahamut are getting 2nd seasons despite not selling well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The number of shows indicates an increased interest in investing in anime. These shows are funded by manga, LN and video game publishers, toy/merchandise companies, TV Networks, marketing/advertising firms and other investors with varying interests. There's more to anime now than disc sales, merchandise sales and boosting manga sales. Using anime to promote LNs and video games is now common practice. We are seeing more multimedia projects that include anime. Then there's the relatively new found wealth known as streaming. Like I said, anime is the most ubiquitous as it has ever been with it being streamed on netflix, hulu, funimation, crunchyroll and other smaller streaming sites. Of course I also said this boom is not sustainable.

Regarding anime... remember how a cour used to be 13 episodes, and most shows were 2 cours? I think it's telling studios can't really afford buying airtime anymore. And the money certainly isn't going to employees.

Two cour late night shows are risky. Production committees have just gotten smarter. If the first cour is a success then they'll make another one. There's still bunch of two cour shows, most of them are daytime because TV networks don't want to reload their time slot every three months. Also studios don't usually pay for the airtime, the investors in the production committee do. Studios for the most part are hired contractors. The exception to that being when a studio wants to make an original anime or invest their own money in exchange for a larger slice of the pie.

<TEXT> The anime was doing a good job of condensing the material early on but it's starting to feel rushed now. It was unavoidable, 90 chapters in one cour is tough to adapt no matter how good the writing staff is. Then again, as a manga reader my perspective is probably skewed, it seems like most anime only watchers are fine with the pacing.

<TEXT> Well, he was disappointingly unspecific but then again his doom and gloom assessments has always been like that. Anime is in a boom right now, producing 30-40 shows a season and the most ubiquitous as it has ever been. Saying that's unsustainable is pointing out the obvious and can be said about any industry going through a boom period.

It might have been worthwhile if he pointed out the declining relevance of physical media which will eventually affect the industry and the possibility of a demand for higher wage which will raise production costs.

However, Mr. Anno does not think that this will mean an end to anime as an artistic form of film. He points out the possibility of the centres of anime production moving to other areas of Asia with good conditions.

Certain parts of anime production are already being outsourced to other Asian studios because it's cheaper. Being payed worse than an already underpaid Japanese animator isn't exactly good working condition. I doubt it'll change so drastically in five years that the industry would move outside of Japan. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, this really isn't true 60 fps motion interpolated since the repeated frames from the 24 fps source were included. I believe this is true for most 60 fps converted anime videos with the exception of CG scenes animated at 24 fps.

I did experiment with getting rid most of the repeated frames and just using the animated frames by cutting the fps to 12. Then motion interpolating up to 60 fps but it looked bad. So much ghosting, even just going from 12 to 24 looked bad. The posted video still have ghosting but nowhere near as bad.

Did another one:

Oonishi: It hasnt been censored recently because of words like p*nis. Otherwise we live in fear every week. Were always like, We have no regrets if this is the last episode! And we give it our best to share it without worries. It wont be strange if it ends at any time. 

Sorachi: Makes people think, Do these people want to die? 

Saitou: Its like we stepped into a mine field. 

Sorachi: Well-prepared to die any moment. Like were looking for a place to die. 

Oonishi: I feel like I can look at things more objectively from the outside after the editors changed, but I also feel like Im tired of living, like Please kill me now! Ive been watching the re-airs at home lately, and I think if I ever have children, Ill never let them watch it. It airs at 6pm, but theres always someone saying p*nis or whatever, its terrible. It takes things too far, doesnt it, this competition mindset? 

Sorachi: I cant lose! (laugh) 

Oonishi: The Tower of Babylon (Lesson 88) aired at 6pm, yknow. 

Saitou: The Tower of Babylon... That was a bit too much. (laugh) 

Oonishi: The neighboring channel is airing Good children lets watch this! (translation) Meanwhile, this channel is airing mosaics. This might be unacceptable even for a late-night show. 

Sorachi: A forced cut and an abrupt ending, this is the true style of Gintama. But the higher-ups might get into trouble. 

Oonishi: And then it revives when its moved to the late-night slot. 

Sorachi: I think thats what they want. 

Oonishi: Like Gintama Z airs at 00:15!

<TEXT> Genocidal Organ was incredibly depressing. Hopefully the film can capture the oppressive and dreary feeling the novel had. 

It was also densely packed with ideas relating to technology, philosophy, psychology, sociology, and politics. Even though it can feel academic at times, it was for the most part thought provoking. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The playerbase around 3 million or so. I really doubt most of the players who watched the anime liked it. Personally, I know of several people who disliked it along with others that I've talked to on the internet.

Conjecture and anecdotal evidence are far worse than small sample size data. My point of contention is people better have data to back it up if they're going to claim something is hated by the majority. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I went back to the space scene. The camera was moving at 24 fps but there were times the characters would start jittering which made it look like a framerate problem. Also in these first few episodes I've noticed some panning and tilting shots where the camera moved at 12 fps, which I don't think happened in the first season. I think Polygon might have been stretched thin since Ronja was two cours and demanded more manpower for higher quality art and animation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Every season I sometimes pickup an anime with a wacky concept (e.g. Kancolle, Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei) just for the novelty of it and with very little expectations. This was my pick for this season and it was definitely better than expected. But now I have some expectations for it and the prospect of adapting a bunch of chapters into 12 episodes doesn't sound too encouraging. I think as long as the show remains funny I'll be satisfied, then give the manga a read sometime later. </TEXT>

Kind of disappointed that the phonetic lip syncing and expressive facial animation that Polygon did in Sanzoku no Musume Ronja didn't carry over to season 2 of Sidonia. This pretty much suggests the budget difference between the two. Action scenes still looked great with great sense of speed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hmm...plans for the 2nd season was announced on November 2014, that's news to me. First season sold really bad (374 discs first week sales). The backers must have known this would be the case from the start, so the anime series was mainly for the promotion of the Garo franchise.

I'm in for the 2nd season. The 1st season had an uneven quality but nothing egregiously dislikeable. It also had some great moments and overall the show was entertaining. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This was my second read through so it didn't affect me as much but I remember being close to tearing up at the "I love you" part. The nice slow build up to that part was what made it so emotive.

The rooftop scene was practically Kaori's love confession so this letter was more of a reinforcement of her feelings and less of a confession beyond the grave. Although some may feel it's still the latter and be peeved by it.

I thought it was a great manga. Kousei's character development had an ebb and flow to it instead of a linear progression. It made his development feel natural since people don't improve and change at a constant pace. The story was also very effective at demonstrating the notion of bonding, healing and expressing oneself through music. I think this was less of a love story and more of a human drama between two people supporting each other through music as they navigate lifes tribulations. </TEXT>

Actually one of the best character and facial animation I've seen in anime is from Sanzoku no Musume Ronja, another CG show done by Polygon.

Really liked how Yona's development through a climactic external conflict was followed by her having to face her internal conflict, which is her feelings for Soo-Won. Pretty damn excited about the reactions from Yona, Soo-Won and Hak in the final two episodes.

Also, Hak is barely making any progress with Yona as it is and now Soo-Won shows up.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Read this chapter and then chapter 44...ahh that feeling of enveloping sadness. I was welling but the dam didn't quite break. I think anime will do that if executed really well.

I really appreciate that it didn't go big for the tear jerker, like having Kousei by Kaori's deathbed or something equally superfluously morose. The manga stayed true to her story which is not about that she's terminally ill but the way she lived and her connection with Kousei. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The hand washing scene was excellently storyboarded. The graphic match cuts of Kousei and Kaori's hands working in rhythm with the alternating silence and sound of running water was serenely melancholic.

Also really liked the reserved use of canted framing. It was saved for the right moments. A lot of anime tend to overuse canted shots when things get tense or dramatic and the effect gets lost. The hand washing scene saved it for the last shot and it worked well as a visual supplement to Kousei's emotions.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anime in general tend to be prudish about sex, it's not just isolated to female characters. The commenter also seems to heavily conflate sexual expressiveness with intellectual competency, as if one cannot occur without the other.

While most female leads aren't sexually expressive I think it's uncommon in modern anime that they're depicted as inferior and woefully incompetent compared to male counterparts. Of course the commenter will just dismiss that notion with a comment like this:

Obviously I'm painting very broad strokes, and no anime-watchers will struggle to produce counterexamples. Nevertheless, I think if they're honest with themselves, they'll see that anime generally sexualizes women by showing their virginal charm. Rarely is the female lead of anime world-wise or sexually-liberated. Westerners would accept that much more readily. But unfortunately, dojikko and emotionally stunted *-deres are 300x more common. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The way the manga showed she was dying was so sudden that it took a while to process. It also took a while for Kousei to process what happened.

<TEXT> The love triangle drama coming to a head right now feels kind of odd. At this point I feel like the focus should be Kousei's competition, Kaori's condition and their desire to play together again. But then again I also thought Nagi's appearance was also odd and that worked out really well. </TEXT>

I got a feeling that Watari is going to see through Kaori, be a bro and bat for Kousei.

Not even an ounce of jealousy from Yona. Hak has his work cut out for him.

Also if you want another fantasy show with a badass redheaded female MC, I really recommend **The Twelve Kingdoms**. It's a slower show and far more serious and darker. The character development is some the most gratifying in anime and the world building is detailed and expansive.

<TEXT> The dialogue between Kousei and Kaori was serene with a touch of melancholy. Great stuff.

Unless the mangaka backtracks, I think in the end the story would just imply that Kaori is terminally ill but not actually show her death. I think this way it makes her story more about the way she lived instead of that she died. </TEXT>

It almost feels like Ikuhara came up with the ideas and symbolisms first and then haphazardly attached a story and characters to them. In contrast to his other work, Utena, the characters were the heart of the show and the symbolism were built around them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> While Maria is performing good deeds, Saint Micheal is partially right that heavenly or witch interference whenever something bad happens messes too much with the natural order of things. Although he's also in the extreme end by not doing anything. Like with most matters, moderation is key.

Maria tries to stop the war mostly for the selfish reason of hating it, which results in her not seeing the bigger picture.

So, Saint Micheal does have a point but he's just a dick about it. With that said you should all still convert to Wicca and worship thy Goddess Maria. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Akira remains the gold standard for anime. Plenty of scenes were full animation (24 fps). The lip syncing is phonetically animated, so there's no flapping mouth effect. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Best animal animation.

The adventurous mischief of Ronja and Birk is really charming. They also have great chemistry. That was a fun and feel-good episode until that inauspicious ending.

<TEXT> Sounds like this might be his third feature length film. I think his two feature length films (The Place Promised in Our Early Days and Children Who Chase Lost Voices) were his weaker works. His character writing is great and shorter films play to that strength but longer films require more storytelling which I think he struggles a bit with. For longer films having a co-writer might be of benefit, just like Hosoda had Satoko Okudera as a co-writer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Kaori smiled! I'll take any positive thing I can get. I also really liked that Tsubaki has come to accept her feelings for Kousei but also understood how delicate his situation is. I just wished this was done right after chapter 29.

The Watari and Kousei dialogue was great and handled with a light touch that made it feel genuine. Kousei was in anguish but not super angsty. Watari was supportive but not pushy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Melodrama is not inherently bad writing. It's just another tool at the writer's or director's disposal. Whether it turns out well or not depends on how it is used.

This subreddit has a habit of attaching negative connotation to tropes and cliche, which is lazy criticism and lacks critical thinking. What should be criticized is how the trope is used and not the trope itself.

<TEXT> I maybe wrong about this, but I think this was the season when the league put more emphasis on calling fouls on contact. This was to boost scoring as a response to the low scoring finals between the Spurs and the Pistons. In that list there were six players attempting more than 10 or more free throws per game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the whole substitute thing was just playful teasing by Kaori that Kousei sort of took to heart. I think even Watari realizes this, hence the scene when he asked Kaori if she likes Kousei and why he keeps encouraging him.

I also think Kaori, unlike Tsubaki, is fully aware of her feelings for Kousei. She just strikes me as a more honest character (to herself). But as you mentioned her terminal illness makes fully engaging difficult. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exactly, there's nothing inherently bad with tropes it's how you use them. Storytelling has been around for a long long time, there's a trope for everything. Saying a story or character is bad because they fit a trope is lazy criticism since any character and story, if you simplify them enough can be distilled to a certain trope.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, people love to blame the studio when things don't go right but I think a lot of the time they're just hired to animate and the production committee that's paying them have the final say on things. This is also the reason why low sales doesn't always mean the studio lost money. They're paid to animate and they're not investing their own money. Low risk work in exchange for not having full creative control.

I also wasn't aware that Deen did Maria-sama ga Miteru series. Very pretty anime.

It's very unfortunate that recency bias and the circle jerk mentality lead to lack of appreciation of a studio's older works and contribution to anime. The saddest example of this is Toei. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow, not a single mentioned of Mamoru Oshii (Ghost in a Shell, Patlabor OVA, Patlabor 1 2, Angel's Egg) and Isao Takahata (Grave of the Fireflies, Only Yesterday, The Tale of Princess Kaguya). Well at least someone mentioned Takahiro Omori, who's so ridiculously under appreciated.

Out of the big name directors Oshii has the most distinct style. He plays with rhythm a lot, both with editing and visuals. His shot length tend to be longer, which produces a slower, more meticulous and contemplative rhythm than most anime. A style that really fits the content of his movies, which mostly deal with thought provoking themes.

Takahata is the mature side of Ghibli. His characters are more complex and nuanced than Miyazaki's. This is very much evident when the character drama in The Tale of Princess Kaguya is compared to The Wind Rises. Kaguya just offered a more compelling character with a more realized internal struggle. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The extended Emi flashback definitely could've been included in the last episode but even if that was done Kousei's performance wouldn't have fit into one episode. In the manga the performance is a little but more than three chapters long. Emi's flashback was extended to make the cutoff of Kousei's performance less awkward.

The show has been a very faithful adaptation of the manga, so the flashbacks were suppose to be there. The performances would've been emotionally empty without the flashbacks. You can argue about their placement and perhaps the story should've began from the very beginning but altering the story structure so much is something the manga author might not agree with. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, this post explains your complaint better.

My point of contention with your initial post is that it's such a simplification that it can be applied to a lot of shows. It's just a dramatic device, how it's used determines if the characters and story turn out well or not.

Ping Pong is multitudes better than this show but uses the same dramatic device. The obvious difference maker being Ping Pong has much better execution and justification for using it. </TEXT>

Polygon most likely had a higher budget in this show than in Knights of Sidonia. It's a 7:00 pm show with Ghibli's name attached to it.

Also Knights of Sidonia had it's "sakuga" moments:

The tracking shot follows Kousei and slowly reveals Kaori. As Kaori comes more into view in the frame, Kousei spots her and comically hides from her. It then switches to Kousei's POV, which puts the audience in his shoes and makes it easy to root for the guy. The insert shot of the sandwich (suggesting he wants to give it to her) shows him finally mustering up some courage, then only to be thwarted by Watari.

<TEXT> I thought Mohawk guy's incompetent communication skills exacerbating the situation was funny. Just watching things progressively get worse as he kept on putting his foot in his mouth was really amusing. Miyamori being the final piece to his domino effect of fuck-ups was a great way to top it off. I can't hate on Mohawk guy, his antics made for some good situational comedy.

I really like that the show presented a reasonable voice to discuss the situation between CG vs traditional animation. The notion that CG and traditional animation can work together and animators from both sides can learn from each other reflects the collaboration between Ghibli and Polygon. I think those two studios working together is a great learning experience for both. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The flashbacks could've been handled better. The way it was told felt disjointed and having to connect the dots got in the way of the flow of the drama.

The ending was really sweet though.

<TEXT> Another amazing episode. This last cour is shaping up to be the best of the series. This anime is unparalleled in terms of intertwining human drama and speculative fiction elements. The only ones that come close are Natsume and Mononoke. 

My only criticism of the series is it relies too much on flashbacks to set up the story and characters. It can feel a bit formulaic at times, but the stories are so good that I barely even mind it.

<TEXT> I thought it was fine. Her character struggles are finally being established. I believe the show got criticized about it when it glossed over it in the last arc of the first season. It would be kind of silly to begin establishing her struggles and have her progress from it, all in one episode.

Low self-esteem issues aren't exactly easily fixed.

You're also overly simplifying her situation. She's clearly self conscious about her physical appearance and there's a sense of isolation. That probably has a lot to do with why she wants to get stronger and take part in a raid.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Three episodes covered 5 chapters. The first chapter is a long one so it really equates to 6 chapters. This season is scheduled for 24 episodes, so that would be around 50 chapters. At least I'm hoping that would be the pace, instead of 70+ chapters being compressed in 2 cours.

Anyway, I ended up marathoning up to chapter 18. Just couldn't help myself, but that was a good stopping point and satiated my curiosity. The most surprising part was the humor. I hope that translates well to the anime. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The characters feel alive. There's constant facial expressions (eyes, eye brows, mouth) and body language during dialogues. The mouth is animated to match how they speak (like Akira) so there's little flapping mouth effect unlike in most anime. The mouth movements weren't always perfect but I thought they looked good for the most part.

The shadows are dynamic. If you watch the facial animation video again, you'll notice the character's flapping tunic casts a shadow that moves along with it.

For more dynamic movements, I think the videos I posted are representative of the show.

As for negatives, I wish this was fully animated at 24 fps especially since the overall animation is really well done. After years of watching limited animation, I'm used to 12 fps but I hope CG anime would eventually progress to 24 fps. The 24 fps portion of Knights of Sidonia looked really good.

I also wish Ronja's running animation had more variety, she runs a bit too perfectly like a track athlete. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This episode exuded a great sense of adventure and wide eyed wonder. It was hard not to smile seeing Ronja running through the forest while giggling with excitement.

The grey dwarves were effectively creepy just like the harpies.

Also the sound design in this show is amazing. The sound of the wind, the flowing water, the insects and birds really brought the forest to life.

I think people are really missing out here. This might actually have better production value than Fate/stay night and Shingeki no Bahamut. The background work, camera work, sound design, the facial animation, character animation and the overall atmosphere all have been great so far. </TEXT>

Nope. Anime is still mostly done on two's.

This small clip from Space Dandy is what animation done on one's looks like: https://mediacru.sh/RoqPZSo9xRBV

I would say most shows aren't close to looking that smooth in a consistent basis.

<TEXT> **The motion they used didn't even call for it really**. Unless they used the model elsewhere, they would've been better off making it using traditional animation all the way through.

There's a reason why most camera movements in z-axis are done in CG and that's because it would be more difficult and time consuming with traditional animation while yielding marginally better/worse results. If that part of the scene was done traditionally the animator would have to painstakingly redraw the cobblestones to account for perspective changes. This is time better spent on character animation. Using CG was just the most efficient option while still yielding the desired results. </TEXT>

<TEXT> On another note, the frame rate in Pixar movies (or in anime, actually, **since most anime is also done at 24fps**) likely isn't really an issue because there are certain things animators do (and specifically avoid doing) to make animation smoother at a lower frame rate. The choppiness you see in CGI is likely because the computer is purely mathematical -- it doesn't really think "Hm, this needs corrected slightly," like a good animator will.

No on the bolded part. Yes there's 24 frames in each second but with most anime only 12 out of 24 are unique frames and the rest are repetition. It's animation done on "2's." With cheaper anime it's done on "3's." This is aptly called Limited Animation.

Pixar movies are fully animated, meaning 24 unique frames per second or done on "1's" </TEXT>

<TEXT> Such a heartwarming show about friendship, growth and finding a joy in something among friends.

Even though there's an overload of cuteness (which I didn't mind) and a few sappy moments, the show didn't really depend on these to carry the characters and the story. These were just aspects that complemented the core of the show, which is the sincerity of the bond between these characters. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lovely use of [eyeline match](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyeline_match) in this [sequence](http://imgur.com/a/M9S2k). First we see Tanaka looking out the window. The reflection of the crows makes it obvious what's he's looking at. Then it cuts to the crows themselves. Next cut is Daichi looking up at the same crows. A nice flowing continuity from one shot to another that also creates a sense of connection between the two characters.

<TEXT> Let's see. Saazbaum attempted to kill the person that Slaine loves the most and started a war that killed millions or maybe billions of people. Then Saazbaum learned that the princess was still alive and made his intention to kill her clear to Slaine. And yet Slaine felt compelled to save him.

There's very little between Slaine and Saazbaum that should outweigh his love for Seylum or simple logic. Yes, Saazbaum spared his life but it wasn't exactly out of mercy or that he valued him as a person. The thought process of, "Hey, I would totally kill you but I owe your father one" isn't exactly a sign of goodwill. If that was enough then Slaine isn't so bright. Well, maybe I'm discounting the effectiveness of Saazbaum's slide show presentation of his feelings. 

As heart-wrenching that episode was the lasting impression is how the clumsy writing made Slaine look like a huge idiot, which really shouldn't be the case.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The last two episodes adapted the most emotional parts of the manga really well. Dare I say, it did them even better since I didn't get these feel while reading the manga.

People want a second season but this might be one of those rare times that an anime original ending might be preferable. Unless you're in a mood for wishy washy romance melodrama. I certainly was at the time so I still found it entertaining  but there was a definite drop-off in quality. </TEXT>

The manga is not really popular so these sales seem fine. Also the series is only sold as BDs, which is baffling. Not having it available in DVD is money left on the table.  </TEXT>

I think the storyboarding carried that scene. The insert shots of the glasses were timed so well with the dialogue.

<TEXT> Your complaint has been less and less of a problem lately, at least with the shows that I've been watching. Take Akame ga Kill for example. It's a rather low budget looking show but the dialogues are handled competently.

Let's use this scene as an example: http://a.pomf.se/olnybc.webm

Shot by shot breakdown

Establishing shot  a wide shot that gives a sense of time and place. The two characters are at a dinner table and its late afternoon (sunset colored sunlight)

Medium close-up of prime minister

High angle shot behind the prime minister with the camera tilting  yes this fits your complaint about characters talking while facing away from the camera but this actually serves a purpose. The camera tilting to the prince is a visual of the dialogue flow with him at the receiving end.

Medium close-up of the prince (continuity from the tilt shot)

Medium shot of prime minister (shot reverse shot). Prince holds up a paper and PM looks at it.

Cut to an eyeline match of what the PM is looking at, which is the paper with a list on it (again this is continuity from the last shot).

Close up of PM (with some badly done shallow focus) and then prince (shot reverse shot). The close ups give a better sense of their predicament.

Re-establishing shot, slow zoom out and fade out to black.

The cinematography wasn't elaborate. It wasn't compositionally heavy, although the arc in the background was used as a framing element and the ray of light as leading lines. But, IMO it wasn't stale shot making and had a decent grasp of visual continuity.

<TEXT> Rafael asks: 

In film, the camera is one of the most basic yet powerful tools of expression in a filmmaker's arsenal. As you are a film scholar, I'm sure you already know the power of a well-composed shot. My question is this: Anime relies a lot on static shots, largely for budgetary reasons (moving backgrounds, characters on a rotating dolly shot, etc. are hard to animate as perspective changes). There's not a lot of tracking/dolly/crane/steadicam shots in anime. Knowing how much the movement of the shot (or lack thereof) influences how the audience views a scene emotionally, how do you think has anime's reliance on static shots influenced its cinematic language? Do you think they've explored techniques in the static shot enough so that they don't have to rely so much on tracking shots to communicate the same emotions? I'm aware that there are numerous other things that affect the shot composition, but I wanted to ask about static shots specifically. 

**Moving the camera is actually something that didn't pop up much in motion picture history until relatively late. Early silent film cameras were bulky and heavy, and moving them was just too difficult. (You may have seen footage of a giant merry-go-round built for doing chase scenes in the silent era. The merry-go-round was for the actors and set, while the camera stayed on the ground.) This started to become less of a problem towards the end of the silent era, but then when talkies came the additional burden of the sound equipment and having to stay absolutely silent during shooting put a damper on adventurous camera technique. It took a long time for cinema to recover from the stiffness introduced by microphones. While cameras might have been able to shift around in place on a tripod, actually moving the camera, and the devices with which that could be done smoothly like dollies or jibs (mini-cranes for cameras) were things that had to be invented after that point, starting in the late 1930s. Hand-holding the camera was often too shaky until the Steadicam was invented, and that didn't become commonplace until the late 1980s.**

**Animation had similar limitations in that you could always move the camera, but doing so was a lot more trouble than it was usually worth. The low-budget nature of anime also meant that new inventions that made such things easier were slow in coming to Japan. Multi-plane animation techniques pioneered by Disney in the 30s and 40s (which you see as different layers of backgrounds panning across the screen at different speeds) didn't get used much in anime until the 1970s. And Japan pretty much skipped the early computer-aided drafting era of animation in the late 80s, not integrating computers into their workflows until early 2000s. So, for a very, very, very long time -- until the last decade, really -- anime creators were pretty much stuck with only the camera techniques they could draw by hand.** 

**Luckily, this worked quite well when combined with Japanese filmmaking, which leans heavily on the Yasujiro Ozu school of long, still shots, with cuts to close-ups for dramatic effect, and cuts to random little asides (a piece of litter, a glass of water -- Ozu called these "pillow shots") as a rhythmic pause, as if the life of a scene is taking a breath. The technical limitations of anime and that style of filmmaking work very well together, which is probably why the art form is so heavily influenced by it, whereas Japanese live action filmmaking has long since moved on.** 

**I think the economy with which the camera moves in anime tends to inherently give those shots more importance. A moving point of view shot happens so seldom, and the craft in which things move is so labored and clearly difficult, that it can't help but make an impression. It's similar to how body language is portrayed in anime: every twitch of a finger, every eye movement was a deliberate choice by the animators, and is important; it's never because an actor had a fly land on them or has an itch. That extra motion doesn't happen very often, so when it does, we take notice, and try to observe why it's happening. It adds meaning to a scene.** 

**There are still moving camera shots that take my breath away: hand drawn ones like the subway shoot-out in Kite, or the opening shot in The Heroic Legend of Arslan. There are moving camera shots that make me chuckle because they couldn't quite pull it off, like an early scene in Black Magic M-66 where the camera chases two people running through the woods, and the perspective of all of the passing trees gets completely screwed up. Even Paprika, which was an all-digital work, made innovative use of changing perspective in several shots, to breathtaking effect.** 

**Lately, I think some of the best, most pioneering work in terms of changing-perspective animation can be found in some of the insanely intricate swimming scenes in the current season of Free! That show is visually mind-blowing, even if all of the exposed flesh in that show does nothing for you.**

<TEXT> I've been watching some older anime lately, like Future Boy Conan, Maison Ikkoku, Utena and Touch. The voice acting were fine but they weren't some revelation exposing me to the wonders of pre-2000's voice work.

I do understand the complaints about high pitched voices but when shows have teenage girls being voiced by full grown women then of course it would sound unnatural as they try to adjust their voice to match a younger age.

[First 10 minutes of Tomino's new show, Gundam Reconguista in G](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN3KN5Xlo8U). Again, the voice work is fine but nothing special. On the other hand, that Yugo Kanno OST is sounding amazing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The show is hit or miss but some of the hits are really good.

This episode (S2 episode 8) isn't guitar themed but the soundtrack for it is great. Great episode by the way, even if you end up not liking the story (I didn't like it that much either), everything else was exceptional (cinematography, animation, art, etc.) and a delight to watch.

I would also recommend S2 episode 5. Probably the best episode of the series. </TEXT>

Sally-sensei might save the day in the next episode and perhaps change Machi's view of her.

<TEXT> I'm no chemist but the potassium chlorate can act as an oxidizer for the initial ignition. The oxygen in the air maintains it. Whether that initial ignition is enough to start a reaction in a Hydrogen filled atmosphere might be the question.

The head of "strike anywhere" matches contain an oxidizing agent such as potassium chlorate together with tetraphosphorus trisulfide, P4S3, glass and binder.  The phosphorus sulfide is easily ignited, the potassium chlorate decomposes to give oxygen, which in turn causes the phosphorus sulfide to burn more vigorously.


The head of safety matches are made of an oxidizing agent such as potassium chlorate, mixed with sulfur, fillers and glass powder.  The side of the box contains red phosphorus, binder and powdered glass.  The heat generated by friction when the match is struck causes a minute amount of red phosphorus to be converted to white phosphorus, which ingnites spontaneously in air.  This sets off the decomposition of potassium chlorate to give oxygen and potassium chloride.  The sulfur catches fire and ignites the wood.

Sugawara is definitely better at being a glue for the team and seeing the bigger picture but Kageyama gives them intensity and edge. Kageyama can get overwhelmed mentally while with Sugawara it's physically/athletically. I like how the show presented these differences. </TEXT>

It really wouldn't be that surprising if Aldonoah and Persona made A-1 money. 

Also Space Brothers and Fairy Tale are daytime anime and mostly dependent on TV ratings rather than BD/DVD sales. Considering they are/were long running shows I'm pretty sure they made A-1 money.

Yeah, this guy isn't as knowledgeable as he likes to think he is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Finally, Asseylum does something. 

Inaho wants that Aldnoah tech that Asseylum can provide and he doesn't want to risk having Slaine get in the way of things. Although, getting that tech comes at the price of prolonging the war and more casualties but Inaho would probably see it as strategically justifiable for the sake of reaching parity with the Martians. I think Inaho will be entering Machiavellian mode.

Of course there's also Asseylum's view on things to be taken into account. The show is starting to get more interesting with all these significant factors coming into play. I hope its handled well and avoids over-simplification or being convoluted. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also, people need to keep in mind that talent development is a fickle thing and having a stacked farm system doesn't guarantee long term success.

2006 D-backs farm system is probably more stacked than this Cubs farm system and only made it to the playoffs twice since then. That prospect class included Justin Upton, Stephen Drew, Conor Jackson, Carlos Quentin, Chris Young and Carlos Gonzalez. Although, Quentin and CarGo were used as trade pieces.

On a more positive side, for the past two seasons the hyped 2010 Royals farm system has been coming to fruition. Although Hosmer and Moustakas have been disappointing. </TEXT>

Asseylum continues to sit on her hands and the show's excuses for it have been fairly poor. I think these two are the most frustrating parts of the show. 

We need more dead pan deliveries from Inaho. That would justify his total lack of emotion. He's also reaching Tatsuya level of tactical omniscience.

I don't mind exposition since that Mech exploding in the ocean with little explanation would've been a WTF moment but there has to be a better way to do them. These mid-fight and post-fight expositions feel like lectures. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good episode with the exception of some awkward exposition towards the end. The enemy mech needing to have openings to receive signals and to walk could've been mentioned during prep time. That would've been enough to make the water strategy to be self explanatory.

I'm also curious about the mechanics of that energy field. The show just can't ignore the law of conservation of mass and energy. </TEXT>

While the build up was amusing and hyped up the match I thought it took too long. Last episode was basically a build up episode, dedicating another 18 minutes to it seemed rather excessive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Prior to the Royals there were the 2006 Diamondbacks with Justin Upton, Stephen Drew, Conor Jackson, Carlos Quentin, Carlos Gonzalez and Chris Young. Quentin and Gonzalez were used to get Haren. Their pitching prospects aren't worth mentioning hence the Haren trade.

2007 and 2011 were the only good years they had. D-backs and Royals show how fickle talent development could be. Even the Rays took years to figure it out. </TEXT>

I think that's quite the opposite. He usually follow his emotions impulsively (with both negative and positive results). Right now he's feeling scared, so his instinctive response is to avoid the situation. If he actually thought things through he would've arrived to a logical conclusion that it's best for Kaori's recovery for them to stay "special" friends.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So Sidonia did not encounter a Gauna for a hundred years. Then Nagate surfaces and almost right away a Gauna shows up.

The Captain predicted that the Council would want Nagate dead so she purposely navigated Sidonia into Gauna territory so she can sortie him and somewhat appease the Council. Although not ideal, this situation fits her strategy of defeating the Gauna instead of running away, with Nagate as her ace just like the way she pictured Hiroki should have been. This is also why she doesn't give a shit about the Kabi's attracting Gaunas.

Also I'm speculating Ochiai threw away the Kabis in order to force the Council to use his Gauna-Human hybrid as a weapon since it can kill Gaunas without a Kabi. </TEXT>

Hase gets clean up duty. His crepe date then goes to hell. He loses special friends status. Fujimiya seems to have stopped writing in her diary. The street light then forebodingly flickers off on Hase. All of these happened in a span of one day.

Being Hase truly is suffering. </TEXT>

The story about Ayano and the orphans, the story of the Monster, the Snake's schemes and how Kano fits in all of this were awkwardly put together. There was no flow whatsoever.

I was hoping for a jigsaw puzzle story that would cleverly put the pieces together but with only three episodes left I would not get my hopes up that the show can pull that off.

<TEXT> AoT animation was even more inconsistent than KoS. The first half of that show was littered with stills and some of them out of context to the dialogue. There were even [unfinished](http://media.animevice.com/uploads/1/13547/659701-2hmdkci.jpg) portions and the studio [apologized](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-05-09/attack-on-titan-staff-apologizes-for-unfinished-episodes-on-3-stations) for some of them.

Also, in general, anime shows are animated in low framerates. We're talking about 8-12 fps or sometimes lower. KoS isn't really any worse than any anime in terms of FPS, it just looks more jarring when applied to CG. Just imagine any Pixar movie rendered at 8 fps and it would look more noticeable than most animes.

KoS's frame rate has gotten better though and action always looked fluid. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Only ones I know that were clear about couples having sex:

**NANA.** Also much of the romance centers around adults who are already in a relationship. It's great and much different than most romance animes, I highly recommend it.

**Otona Joshi no Anime Time.** Four different stories about four different women. It deals with adults so the themes are mature; single working woman, unhappy marriages, and dysfunctional family. 

**ef: a tale of memories.** Teen romance with the common anime trait of characters unable to commit. The characters are well written though.

There's also White Album 2 and Clannad. </TEXT>

This episode did sports speeches really well. Those speeches a lot of the time feel obligatory and contrived just like they did in Episode 4. In this episode they felt really natural and flowed with the story and dialogue. 

Also the OST if amazing.

Also we finally get a connection between the "Monster" and the rest of the cast. The teacher, who's also Ayano's father seems to be involved also. Maybe they're the family?

Eternity seems to be a theme here. The monster is immortal, Ene woke up in a body that's practically immortal, Haruka seems to have been granted an immortal body and Ayano seems to exists in a time and space where she's eternal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the flashback in Episode 2 when as a kid Smile said he wanted to be like Peco, I don't think he meant in terms of skill and talent. I don't think he saw him as a hero in that way either. I think for him, to be like Peco is to love and enjoy Ping Pong. Smile probably did enjoy Ping Pong but as he watched Peco's passion for the sport fade way so did his enjoyment along with it.

What I think Smile is playing for and chasing after is that enjoyment for the sport that he used to share with Peco. </TEXT>

There's a difference between institutionalized discrimination and personal bigotry. They seemed to be fighting against the latter when the former is far more important. The former could be changed with progressive policies while the latter can't.

Obviously bigotry is not OK but like Mayumi said you can't change what an individual feels by force.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess those Gardes are worth more than civilian lives and structural damage. As cold as it sounds it kind of makes sense since they're the only line of defense and must be used as a last resort. Even just losing 1/8 of their Gardes would be a huge blow and that's with very little guarantee that the Guana won't get through. So if the option to evade is there then it's probably the best option most of the time.

Still pretty ballsy and quick risk assessment by the Captain.

I didn't expect to experience such an intense space battle so soon after Yamato 2199. What a great surprise.

Also gotta love the detail and design on those graphic displays, UI, and flight instruments. It's the little things that create the space sci-fi atmosphere. </TEXT>

<TEXT> At first I was worried about the jealousy angle but the episode fortunately didn't dwell on it and merely used it as a cause of conflict. And the dialogue was good enough that it came off as a natural reaction from a young man who's in love. Although, I still would've preferred if the show used something less cliche and convenient.

I also really liked how vague they are about the diary during the riverside conversation. It expresses how unsure they are on how to handle the situation but both know how important it is to them. I think that really made the resolution all the more gratifying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> CG also allows the animators to have more freedom with the camera work since the camera is operating in 3d. In 2d they redraw all the different angles which is a lot more work. The amount of camera angles, transitions, and different POVs that we saw in this show's action scenes are something you're rarely going to see in 2d animation.

Also I really like the lighting and shadowing in this show, again something hard to pull off in traditional animation.

Hopefully CG in anime keeps improving, variety is a good thing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tsukimoto's strong sympathy for his opponents is a big weakness but equally so is his view of ping pong as something inconsequential to him. Even if he can become a stonecold player there's really not much that drives him to win, after all this is just a hobby to him. Once he meets his match talentwise he wouldn't have as much resolve as someone who loves the sport, committed to excellence and have a strong will to win.

Weirdly enough Tsukimoto reminds me of Nodame (a pianist) from Nodame Cantabile. Both are talented at their craft but for differing reasons they have trouble committing to it and seeing it as more than a hobby. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, a bit heavy handed with the character emotions and motives. It's going with the old "angsty MC with a tragic past" concept; nothing wrong with that but the portrayal was way too straightforward and unrefined. Despite all of that, I didn't mind the first episode, it was effective in establishing the dark tone albeit a bit forceful, and it did enough to piqued my interest.

Hopefully the drama doesn't get too overbearing and the show would let it breath. I haven't seen much of Okada's work but she's been criticized for overdone melodrama, so I'm crossing my fingers here. I really really liked Anohana though, melodrama aside. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ugh, I was really hoping it wouldn't do the "beat some sense into him" cliche. That was just bad writing because Ignacio barely exists as a character and all of a sudden he's playing a significant role in the MC's life this late in the season. It also robbed us of a possible good interaction between Kal and Ariel since it really should've been Ariel talking some sense into him. Really, the best thing this anime has going for it is the relationship between Ariel and Kal, and in a very important moment it decided to go away from it.

Pretty disappointed with this show since I really, really liked The Princess and the Pilot. </TEXT>

After a few episodes that made me want to smack Yukine, this episode actually made me sympathize or at the very least empathize with him. Also you're right about Yato, despite his good intentions of wanting to reform Yukine and not give up on him, he really hasn't handled the situation gracefully. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Japanese aren't big time purchasers of DVD/BDs so it makes sense to maximize price in a limited market.


This [ANN article](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2012-03-07) explains it better:

The High Prices... Explained!

To a Westerner, the Japanese DVD market seems horribly overpriced. With the average disc running over 7,000 (US$92) and only containing 2-4 episodes of a series, the cost of collecting a single show can easily run several hundred dollars -- more than many American fans spend in a single year. 

The prices actually stem from a business practice we used to have in America, too: rental pricing. Basically, back in the dawn of the home video business, the industry was constructed in a way where "niche" releases were only meant to sell a few thousand copies, mostly to video rental shops. Prices were high (typically $89.95 in America), but video shops benefited from having a wide and semi-exclusive selection of movies that normal people would never pay for. At those prices, only a few thousand sales could mean over a million dollars of revenue. Initially, video industry people didn't think there was much of a market in selling to collectors. 

But the fans proved them wrong. Otaku of all kinds (not just anime fans) started buying the videotapes and laserdiscs, and they bought them at those high prices that were intended just for video stores. There was no reason to lower it. **In fact, there were a few experiments to drop the price to a more affordable amount, but that usually resulted in a slight increase in sales -- not enough to make up for the drop in revenue.**

When you think about it, that makes sense. Most Japanese people live in much smaller homes, and with many more people than their Western counterparts. In most cases, it simply doesn't make sense for Japanese consumers to build a big home media library. Only the hardcore fans of a particular product will usually want to bother owning a tape or DVD, and everyone else relies on rental shops. Media is a specialty market, not a mass-market one, so prices have stayed astronomically high. 

The Japanese Otaku's desire to own anime even at high prices had an unexpected effect: as the rest of the economy tanked and video stores stopped buying every new video release, the otaku kept buying pretty much everything that got released. Before long, the few thousand fans that bought anime DVDs were supporting nearly the entire budget of a show. Even as the rest of the Japanese home video industry lowered their prices to varying degrees, anime stayed at the same high price. It's simply the only way most shows can ever make a profit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The best they can do is being done already and that is being available on Crunchy, Hulu, Netflix and having some shows in toonami. Late night anime used to be available on cable TV like Sci-fi Channel and Tech-TV/G4 but those channels are niche. Even in those niche channels anime couldn't draw a decent enough audience to be kept on air.

The only anime that hit mainstream are children's shows like Pokemon, Digimon, DBZ and etc. That's back when children's shows in general were popular, when Kid's WB, Fox Kids and afternoon Toonami existed. Those days are long gone.

Non-sitcom animation for adults in general has always been niche. Archer is on a relevant cable network and in its four seasons has never reached 2 million viewers. If an American made animation of that type can't hit mainstream then anime doesn't have much of a chance

<TEXT> The humor is kind of dull but I see some potential due to the unique premise. Some comedy shows take some time to pick up steam like Gintama which took me about 3-5 episodes to really get into.

I'll give this the 3 episode treatment and if it improves I might keep watching. </TEXT>

Then of course, there's also the action and the music. Best premiere so far this season, looks like it's going to be a fun show. </TEXT>

<TEXT> man that romance was a little rushed with that "grab her as she falls ,stare into each others eyes and embrance" scene.

Yeah, that escalated way too quickly and came off kind of cheesey. A nice dialogue where they share a few laughs would have suffice in establishing the romance.

I was half expecting the show to go Steins;Gate on us, which means having a slow build up leading to shit hitting the fan really fast but I didn't expect the show to go full blown superhero.

I'll go with a wait and see approach before I react to this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh man, this episode was hilarious. It also did a fine job of showing Masayoshi's dedication and pure intentions in a charming way without coming off corny or overly preachy.

Another thing I liked was Mari's little slip of the tongue about letting off steam, I guess that confirms she's really in it for thrill and excitement.

Also Gotobro exuded so much broness in this episode.

I need more Sumi screentime. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Moe waiting for a kiss from Mari was funny.

I like how both Mari and Masayoshi hit a lull in their superhero career and how they dealt with it differently. Masayoshi's passion for heroism was starting to fade and he was becoming jaded, then he realized he's doing this not for fun, not for the hero ego boost but for justice. While Mari was just getting bored since she has little purpose other than entertainment so she dealt with her boredom by upping the ante of her antics.

Looks like both Goto and Hazama will find a common sense of purpose and really start working together. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I mean, this show is about a treasure hunt basically, but this episode didn't include any part of the treasure-hunting! I'm feeling like the show doesn't really know how much time they should spend on characterization that is not the best I've ever seen but still, fairly standard.

Totally agreed with this. The lack of balance between character development and storytelling leads to pretty bad pacing. As a result the treasure just conveniently shows up instead of being discovered. Then there are these random action scenes that just pop up out of nowhere with very little set up.

Despite these glaring flaws I can't get myself to drop this show. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Crotch shots is cheap humor but the show somehow made it work. I guess the character, sound effects and the delivery are what got a laugh out of me.

I'm still enjoying this but it's the Goto and Masayoshi dialogue that made the show engaging and it's kind of veering away from that. Also it feels a bit directionless, other than character introductions the main story has been stagnant. I hope we see more progression since most of the main cast have been established. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Rubinsky and Terran plots could have been done better towards the end. They were intriguing plots initially but by the fourth season they lost a lot of steam and didn't add much tension. It felt tacked on just to add some conflict.

Improvements in animation and ship design would also make the show better. Just imagine Walter von Schenkopp fight scenes with better animation and a bit more flare. </TEXT>

13.46 is not even a good enough time to qualify an American hurdler into the Olympics since America has quite a depth of talent in that event. For example the top three times in the 2012 USA Oympic trials are 12.93, 12.98 and 13.08. </TEXT>

<TEXT> NFL TV deals are nationwide. The league itself signs those deals with CBS, FOX, NBC, and ESPN then redistribute some of that money to the teams. In the NBA and MLB the TV deals are regional. The team itslef negotiate those deals, not the league, which makes revenue sharing difficult because teams are looking out for their own. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For those unaware, Shinkai also wrote a manga and a novel adaptation. The manga has great extensive character development on Kanae, Akari and Risa. IMO the novel has a better depiction of adult Takaki than the manga and the movie.

[In the novel adult Takaki wasn't that hung up on Akari, some memories and feelings would pop up but he didn't hold on to them like he did in the manga and the movie. He even admitted to falling in love with other women. But being heart broken at such an early age seemed to have left a lasting mark on him which led to him giving up on relationships when things get tough.](/spoiler) </TEXT>

Add the fact that they were about to move away from each other which makes expressing their feelings even more difficult. I think most adults would have trouble with the same situation.")

[] (/s "As for keeping in touch, they did try but the letters/texts were just not enough. The manga went over this really well, they both just shied away from the difficulties the distance provided. It's hard to expect two teenagers to try their best to make a long distance relationship work.") </TEXT>
