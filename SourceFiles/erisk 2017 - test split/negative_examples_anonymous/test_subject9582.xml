<TEXT> If you think about it, per an earlier post about the common rooms, The dungeons are cold and not really a place for a snake to be active. I understand how something as large as a basilisk could hibernate in the chamber. It's cold, and snakes sleep when it's cold.

I also understand that the students aren't snakes, but the Ravenclaws were in an aerie(tower), Gryffin(dors) a tower also, Hullfepuffs(badger) were a bit below like a den. Do snakes really sleep that far underground?

**totally unrelated:**
I was watching the 1973 Disney version of Robin Hood today, and Friar Tuck is a badger, so was the Fat Friar. When they showed reward posters for Robin Hood, it was paid in **ingotts.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> When Albus found Harry staring into the mirror, and the whole 'it does not do to dwell' speech.

There is no way he (Albus) could have known Harry was there unless he was already in the room staring into the mirror of desire himself.

It's my theory that Dumbledore was looking into the mirror and heard the door open, so he backed into the shadows and disillusioned himself. When he didn't see anyone open and close the door, he assumed it was Harry because he had just given him the cloak on Christmas.

Albus probably stood there and let Harry enjoy one more bit of time looking at his family before he finally moves it.

<TITLE> An old farmer... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-10 20:49:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> An old hillbilly farmer had a wife who nagged him unmercifully. From morning till night (and sometimes later), she was always complaining about something. The only time he got any relief was when he was out plowing with his old mule. He tried to plow a lot.
One day, when he was out plowing, his wife brought him lunch in the field. He drove the old mule into the shade, sat down on a stump, and began to eat his lunch. Immediately, his wife began haranguing him again. Complain, nag, nag; it just went on and on.
All of a sudden, the old mule lashed out with both hind feet; caught her smack in the back of the head. Killed her dead on the spot.
At the funeral several days later, the minister noticed something rather odd. When a woman mourner would approach the old farmer, he would listen for a minute, then nod his head in agreement; but when a man mourner approached him, he would listen for a minute, then shake his head in disagreement. This was so consistent, the minister decided to ask the old farmer about it.
So after the funeral, the minister spoke to the old farmer, and asked him why he nodded his head and agreed with the women, but always shook his head and disagreed with all the men. The old farmer said: "Well, the women would come up and say something about how nice my wife looked, or how pretty her dress was, so I'd nod my head in agreement."
"And what about the men?" the minister asked. "They wanted to know if the mule was for sale." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Riddle used Harry's blood for two reasons:

1. He needed the blood of an enemy to regain his full body, and sure he could have used just about any witch or wizard in Britain because he was basically PE #1 at the time, but he chose Harry.

2. Which brings us to the second part, he used Harry's blood because he knew from Quirrellmort that he couldn't touch Harry without dying, so he took his blood in order to be able to. </TEXT>

He sent Snape to Voldemort, sent Lupin to the werewolves, Hagrid to the giants, Sirius was revealed as innocent, he regrouped the order and he did all of this within hours of Riddle's return.

Not to mention, Harry got the first hug that actually felt like it was from a mother.

<TEXT> HBP is also my favorite book. I'm not really a fan of the films, but you could say the same.

Harry has that swagger going on, he is like his father, just.. cool. He's worried about Draco of course, and he uses a curse that [SPOILER] Snape taught him to battle Draco, the showdown we finally got to see.

When it came to The Cave, Harry did exactly as he was instructed to. He kept feeding Albus the potion in order to get the [SPOILER] locket from the basin. And then he even chases down Snape and Malfoy because [SPOILER] Snape killed Dumbledore.

IMO, HBP was the best 'whodunnit'. </TEXT>

The woman was shocked, but managed to compose herself and walk into the waiting room where her daughter had been waiting.
Well, daughter, we women celebrate when things are good, and we celebrate when things dont go so well. In this case, things arent well. I have cancer. So, lets head to the club and have a martini.
After 3 or 4 martinis, the two were feeling a little less somber. There were some laughs and more martinis. They were eventually approached by some of the womans old friends, who were curious as to what the two were celebrating.
The woman told her friends they were drinking to her impending end, Ive been diagnosed with AIDS. The friends were aghast, gave the woman their condolences and beat a hasty retreat.
After the friends left, the womans daughter leaned over and whispered, Momma, I thought you said you were dying of cancer, and you just told your friends you were dying of AIDS! Why did you do that??
Because I dont want any of those bitches sleeping with your father after Im gone. </TEXT>

God told them the stairs to heaven were 1,000 steps and on every step he was going to tell them a joke. If they laughed they would not be able to get to heaven.
So the redhead made it to the 45th step and laughed.
The brunette made it to the 200th step and laughed.
But the blonde made it to the 999th step and laughed even before god told his joke.
God asked "Why did you laugh I haven't even told the joke yet"
The blonde said "Hahaha I just got the first one!!!" </TEXT>

<TEXT> Riddle's soul split after Lily refused to step aside and let him kill Harry. When Lily didn't step aside and let him kill Harry, that's what caused the rebounding AK curse, causing a piece of his soul to latch on to the only other living thing in the house (who knows where the damn cat was). Harry was the carrier of Tom's soul that he never intended to make. It was purely accidental, but he properly created the other six, giving him an eight piece soul. </TEXT>

"Suits 5.00 each, Shirts 3.00 each, Trousers 4.50 per pair".
Paddy said to his pal "Mick look at these prices! We should buy a whole lot of those and when we get back to Ireland we could make a fortune.
Now when we go in you stay quiet, okay?
Let me do all da talking 'cause if they hear our accents, they might think we're thickos from Ireland and try to screw us. I'll put on me best English accent.
"Roight ye are Paddy, I'll keep me mouth shut, so I will. You do all da business" said Mick.
They go in and Paddy said in a posh voice "Hello my good man. I'll take 50 suits at 5.00 each, 100 shirts at 3.00 each, and 50 pairs of trousers at 4.50 each. And oyll back up me truck ready to load 'em on, so I will."
The owner of the shop said quietly "You're from Ireland, aren't you?"
"Well....... yes" said a surprised Paddy. "How did you know?"
The owner replied, This is a dry-cleaners." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ricky takes an eight to ten year old Trinity into the gas and go again, and Jacob is there. Ricky lays his gun on the counter, Jacob thinks he's robbing the joint. Then Trin grabs the gun and shoots it.

My pointer is, he ends up insinuating Trinity so they could make a baby when he is at least eight years older, and he watched her growed up. To me, that is really creepy. </TEXT>

There was even an episode in What's New that the animators made fun of themselves in 03 with a "jumping the shark" joke, but has since come back with Mystery Inc. which was a very cool and funny modern take on the gang.

Addendum, I love the Firefly reference. I have not seen one episode of that show, and just recently realized it was a thing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A painting contractor was speaking with a woman about a job. In the first room, she said she would like a pale blue. The contractor wrote this down and went to the window, opened it, and yelled out "GREEN SIDE UP!" In the second room, she told the painter she would like it painted in a soft yellow. He wrote this on his pad, walked to the window, opened it, and yelled "GREEN SIDE UP!" The lady was somewhat curious but she said nothing. In the third room, she said she would like it painted a warm rose color. The painter wrote this down, walked to the window, opened it and yelled "GREEN SIDE UP!" The lady then asked him, "Why do you keep yelling 'green side up'?"
"I'm sorry," came the reply.

<TEXT> Albus Dumbledore explains that it is unwise to make a horcrux from a living thing (Nagini) because all you have to do is destroy the container beyond repair, and it isn't hard to kill something alive.

Harry was not a *true* horcrux anyway, they require an enchantment/ritual to make and he did not do that in 1981. When Riddle used his blood in the graveyard, that kept Harry alive as long as Voldemort was because he used Lily's blood and her sacrifice, so it worked as sort of an anti-horcrux for Harry. </TEXT>

Ron found out about the taboo after he had left the other two in the Forest of Dean. </TEXT>

With superhuman strength borne of fury, she dragged her husband down the stairs to the garage and put his penis in a vise. She then secured it tightly and removed the handle. Next she picked up a hacksaw. The husband terrified, screamed, "Stop! Stop! You're not going to......to....cut it off are you?!" The wife, with a gleam of revenge in her eye, said, "Nope. You are. I'm going to set the garage on fire." </TEXT>

As he waits to get the bartender's attention, a regular sitting next to him calls out, "I'll have another waterloo."
The bartender gives the regular a tall ice cold drink and asks the newcomer what he would like. The thirsty man points to the man next to him and says, "I guess I'll have what he's having, a waterloo."
So the bartender brings the newcomer a tall ice cold drink. The man takes a long deep drink and calls out, "HEY! This isn't any good. It tastes just like water!"
The regular bar patron sitting next to him says, "It is water. That's all I drink," He turns to the bartender and says, "Right Lou?" </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would have a blue smoke dispensary called Sorcerer's Smoke.

We would have many locations throughout the wizarding world, some in muggle villages disguised as normal smoke shops.

Sorcerer's Smoke would cater to those that need a bit of relaxation in their lives, and has just recently come on to the open market.

Our claim to fame would be the many visits by the Dumbledore brothers, and a few more notable aurors in the early underground days. Sorcerer's Smoke used to be a secret on the black market before we became a bit more main stream.

When you walk into our homey shop, you will have your choice of almost fifty blue varieties to help any witch or wizard relax no matter what mood they may be in.

The walls are lined with plush couches and chairs to sink into while you enjoy your wares, so come on down to Sorcerer's Smoke, and relax after a long day!

Goblet was such a *whodunnit*, and Voldemort comes back, and Albus and Cornelius are on different planets at the end.

For HBP, it grabs you in the second chapter. I remember my wife and I reading it the release night thinking, "What the hell is Snape on about?" (we had always thought he was a good guy) Anyway we learned all about Riddle's past and the horcruxes, and then the ultimate act of bravery(?) happened, and there was nothing but speculation for the next 18 months. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I will. One of my friends in High School and I hung out simply because we had *Hem Hem,* connections. He was my age, and our mutual desire was two years younger.

From our junior year to our senior year, we fought over who was going to take her out. She broke up with him so I assumed she was free game our junior year. I took her out on dates for about three weeks, then we split amicably. 

Long story short, come our senior year we became good friends tying to cock block all of her new male interests. 

Not really *good friends,* but we hung out a lot more the last year.

Edit: We always had a discussion if the guy she was with was good enough for her. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A little boy goes up to his father and asks: "Dad, what's the difference between hypothetical and reality?"
The father replies: "Well son, I could give you the book definitions, but I feel it could be best to show you by example. Go upstairs and ask your mother if she'd have sex with the mailman for $500,000."
The boy goes and asks his mother: "Mom, would you have sex with the mailman for $500,000?" The mother replies: "Hell yes I would!"
The little boy returns to his father: "Dad, she said 'Hell yes I would!'" The father then says: "Okay, now go and ask your older sister if she'd have sex with her principal for $500,000."
The boy asks his sister: "Would you have sex with your principal for $500,000?" The sister replies: "Hell yes I would!"
He returns to his father: "Dad, she said 'Hell yes I would!'" The father answers: "Okay son, here's the deal: Hypothetically, we're millionaires, but in reality, we're just living with a couple of whores." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, you got the bit in the first book when they serve detention with Hagrid looking for whatever was killing the unicorns.

You got the bit in the second book when Hagrid told Harry and Ron to follow the spiders.

The bit in the third book when Hagrid walked his CoMC class deep into the forest to get to the hippogiriffs.

And I would also like to ad the scene in OotP when Hagrid introduced the trio to Grawp, and also when Hermione led Umbridge, Ron and Harry deep into the forest where Grawp was.

Edit: Ron didn't go with Harry, Hermione and Umbridge. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love the entire arc of the book, but to me it drags on more than DH does sometimes. 

The main thing I dislike about it is fuckin' Umbridge. If any character in the history of fiction has ever made my skin crawl as much as Dolores Umbridge.

But she got hers in the end didn't she?

<TEXT> I get the parenting thing, because I am one and I would do anything to get my daughter back, but I would not have resorted to telling my enemies/daughter's captor where the good guy was just to get her back.

I'm just saying that was a shitty thing to do. Why couldn't Xeno have just helped them, and let them leave in peace?

Edit: I'll answer my own question. That was after a bit of a lull in the story, so it brought some excitement.

Kreacher belonged to the *Noble House of Black* and when Sirius told him to "Get out!" Kreacher took that as a command because Sirius was his master and he disappeared over the winter months, remember? Sirius was not very kind to Kreacher and the poor guy was locked up at 'Grim old place' with no one to talk to but Walburga's portrait. Padfoot even said he was crazy in the book.

When Harry inherited 12GP from Sirius he also inherited Kreacher, and that is why Kreacher was silenced when Harry told him to shut up in the chapter you spoke of, *Will and Won't?* One of my favorites. </TEXT>

<TEXT> An earlier post got me thinking. We know that they went to school together, was Petey sneaking up the stairs (boys can't go up the girl's stairs) as a rat to crawl in bed with Bertha?

It's my headcanon that that is how Peter piqued her interest in Albania, because they had known each other at school.

<TEXT> This is pretty much it. Riddle had to kill Harry in order to destroy his own bit of soul inside of Harry, essentially a creator destroying his own horcrux.

Albus has spoken a few times about certain types of magic...

Edit: I know that Harry was not a *true* horcrux, but he was still carrying a bit of Voldemort inside of himself.

The driver says, "I'm sorry, officer; I'm not from around here."
The trooper writes the guy a ticket and gives his license back, then walks around to the car's passenger side and taps on the window. The passenger rolls the window down, and the trooper smacks him with his night stick.
"Ow!" says the passenger. "What'd you do that for?"
The trooper says, "Just making your wish come true."
"What the hell does that mean?" asks the guy.

The 4-year-old agrees with enthusiasm and they head down stairs.
When their mother walks into the kitchen and asks the 6-year-old what he wants for breakfast, he replies, "Aw hell, Mom. I guess I'll have some Cheerios."
Mom slaps him -- Whack!
The older boy flies out of his chair, tumbles across the kitchen floor, gets up, and runs upstairs crying his eyes out with his mother in hot pursuit, slapping his rear with every step. She locks him in his room and shouts, "You can stay in there until I let you out!"
She then comes back downstairs, looks at the 4-year-old and asks with a stern voice, "And what do you want for breakfast, young man?
"I don't know," he blubbers. "But you can bet your ass it won't be Cheerios!" </TEXT>

He seems like the sort of guy that would expect preferential treatment from his peers, then Harry comes along and produces a corporeal patronus in their third year, something that is seventh year magic or beyond.
I bet there are some fics on this, but let's hear what you lot think.

Edit: Does anyone care to speculate on what Draco's patronus might have been had he not been branded?

<TITLE> How often do you guys re-read the series? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-20 21:07:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As each book was coming out, I would re-read in preparation. After 07/DH I have read the series five or six more times, but it has fallen off lately. Now I just read for certain moments or excerpts, since I pretty much know when things happened.

I guess I am saying that I use the books as more of a reference point than reading cover to cover, unless I'm on a long car ride.

What says r/harrypotter? How many times have you read, and do you still? </TEXT>

<TEXT> A man lay sprawled across three entire seats in a theater. When the usher came by and noticed this, he whispered to the man, "Sorry, sir, but you're only allowed one seat." The man groaned but didn't budge. The usher became impatient.
"Sir," the usher said, "if you don't get up from there I'm going to have to call the manager."
Again, the man just groaned, which infuriated the usher who turned and marched briskly back up the aisle in search of his manager. In a few moments, both the usher and the manager returned and stood over the man. Together the two of them tried repeatedly to move him, but with no success. Finally, they summoned the police.
The cop surveyed the situation briefly then asked, "All right buddy, what's your name?" "Sam," the man moaned. "Where ya from, Sam?" the cop asked.
And with pain in his voice, Sam replied, "The balcony." </TEXT>

<TEXT> We know from *Snape's Worst Memory* that Remus was a prefect, and he sat and watched James and Sirius *levicorpus* Snape, and the hoopla with Lily, and Remus still did nothing. 

Why would you give a werewolf a prefect's badge for starters, and do you think Severus ever held a grudge while he was brewing the wolfsbane?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I enjoyed the bits of Grawp, especially when Harry found out during the Battle of Hogwarts the "Grawp was, in fact, an undersized giant."

My point is, was he unnecessary? Order of the Phoenix was the longest book, and I think it could have been better if JK would have left out the parts about Grawp.
