<TEXT> [Here](https://goo.gl/maps/apAKw) is a link to the location I took the picture on google maps. It's right at the apex of the big u-turn. There's a pull-off on the side of the road where you can get out and look at the canyon. 

If you have time, you should definitely check out Gateway while you're there. There's an awesome place to stay there called [Gateway Canyons Resort](http://www.gatewaycanyons.com) that has TONS of cool stuff. My personal favorite is the auto museum, which isn't that expensive, and you get to go see some really unique cars. The whole place is owned by the guy who owns the Discovery channel, and he's put a lot of work into it and it shows. Anyways, take care and let me know if you have any more questions! </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's called the Hanging Flume and was built by gold miners in 1887. The overall length was 12 miles. It took three years to complete and was only used for three years afterwards. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging_Flume) is a link to the wikipedia page about it. It's a pretty interesting read, and there's a lot more information available if you go looking for it. </TEXT>

Part one, a link to an article showing a concept of a Nintendo phone. Not my article, nor do I get paid for page views.

<TEXT> This reminds me of what happened in my high school. I was in band, and it was generally known amongst the band kids that one of the female students was living with the male band teacher and his wife. She didn't have the best home life, so we all wrote it off as a creepy form of charity. We found out later that our band teacher got fired, and when we also found out he was getting a divorce it didn't take long to figure out what happened. After his divorce, he moved to a different town and married the girl who was living with him. 

We had high hopes for our next band director. He seemed so nice. My senior year was his first year, and we didn't have any problems with him. Seven years later, he ends up in jail for underage p in the v. I ran into him at a chocolate shop last year when I was with my parents, and I didn't recognize him. My dad did though, and he could tell that the creep remembered me and was intentionally avoiding me. Never did find out all the details on that one, though.

<TEXT> When I first awoke I was alone in a forest. I didnt know my name or where I had come from. I saw strange boxes all around me, creating shapes of things that I knew to be familiar, but with dimensions that betrayed the sense of form that was buried somewhere deep in my memory. As I wandered I became aware of the delicate nature of the world, seemingly shifting from towering hills to sprawling desert and blackest jungle on a whim. 
	
The only constant that remained in all of this was an ever-present symbol that stayed in the center of my vision no matter where I went. It always seemed ahead of me, yet I could not believe that it was something I had envisioned. No, it was a beacon, a guide, a powerful force that showed me the one place that I could have any control over the world. It was my guardian, my protector, and my shelter. Without it I would not have survived the night and the creatures that came scratching, bellowing, shooting, and teleporting in numbers far greater than I could have guessed. I owe it my life. This symbol has given me everything, and to it I now build this monument, a cathedral to stand the testament of time.

We do 'Prey Model Raw' and to feed two 40 pound dogs and 2 cats is about $2-3 per day. We get a lot of free meat from hunters as well, and get great deals by buying in bulk from co-ops."

<TEXT> When I was on deployment to the Persian Gulf on a minesweeper, we were doing a large multi-national operation to clear the historically mined areas near the large oil platforms that were mined during the first Gulf War. We had a media day where all of the ships got in a large circle, all facing inwards. The goal was to take a picture of all the ships together, and right in the middle of everything they were going to blow up a mine. As all of the ships had just finished getting into position, a sandstorm came out of nowhere and just swallowed up everything around us. We couldn't see the ship next to us, which was only a few hundred yards away. I thought that there was no way they would blow up the mine without being able to see, but then I heard the countdown come over the radio. Ten, nine, eight...  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This happened a few days ago. I'm re-posting for weekend rules because this got deleted the first time. At the time I wrote this, it was around 3am. Normally at that time, I'm sleeping peacefully in my bed, but I couldn't sleep anymore because of the levels of adrenaline in my bloodstream. My fingers were literally shaking as I wrote this. The rest of the story is unchanged from when I wrote it, so when I say 'tonight' I mean the night that it happened, etc.

As a little bit of background, I normally go to sleep around 10 or 11pm and my wife comes to bed much later, around 2am. Tonight I guess I heard her starting to come to bed and it woke me up. I realized my bladder was full, and right as my tired brain was making the decision to get out of bed I heard the toilet flush. All I thought was 'Great, now it's available!' so I got up. I wanted to expend as little energy as possible so that it would be easy to get back to sleep, so I was walking towards the door in our bedroom when it opened suddenly. All I see on the other side of the door is this bright light which makes me squint and stop in my tracks. My wife, who didn't hear me get up, only sees someone standing right inside the door when she didn't expect anyone to be there. She sees this figure standing there with its arms completely at its sides, totally still, and eyes appearing to be closed. It was at this moment that her brain broke (or rather worked as it's intended to).

She initially stepped back a little, mouth open, arms tucking in, gasping slightly, and then she went full on panic mode and started screaming. She yelled my name three times, each one louder than the last, while recoiling in horror at the sight of someone creepily waiting for her. While she was yelling, I still didn't know quite what was going on, only that I was still extremely sleepy and that I wanted to expend little to no energy so that I could just go to the bathroom and get back to sleep. This changed quickly as I saw her scream into her hands and collapse onto the floor, crying and hyperventilating. She later told me that she didn't collapse until she recognized the stranger in her house was her husband.

I thought she would calm down rather quickly. It didn't happen that way though. She must have used up all her fight or flight instinct for the next 50 years, because she was just shaking and crying and breathing erratically for several minutes. She described it as her brain recognizing that everything is ok, but her body was still in full-blown panic. Meanwhile, I was holding her and apologizing, telling her that it was me and that it was ok, I wasn't going to murder her. Around then she said 'You scared the shit out of me! ...NOT LITERALLY!"

I still really had to go to the bathroom and I was scared that I would literally pee on her, so I left her for a second to go take care of business. Our dog recognized that something was not right and came up to my wife the way she greets us when we come home, with her head low, ears back, and wiggling. She nuzzled my wife with her nose and anytime she stopped getting petted she put her paw on my wife's arm. She's currently still on the bed even though she normally chooses to sleep downstairs.

After things had calmed down a bit, we had to talk to each other to figure out exactly what happened. I told her I wasn't trying to induce a full-blown panic attack, or even scare her a little. I was just sleepy and needed to pee. Now we're both coming down from adrenaline highs, and neither of us is going to be able to sleep for awhile. My wife says she now knows how people feel right before they're murdered.

TL; DR- Went to go to the bathroom, almost ended up with poop everywhere. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't remember, but it was over 5 years ago. They were prescription meds given to us by the vet. As far as the dosage, we would only give him a fraction of a pill. They didn't really stop his car sickness, and in addition to being covered in drool he was cross-eyed, lethargic, and it took too long to wear off. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We used to give him meds, but he was always so loopy afterwards that we discontinued it. He's actually gotten quite a bit better. He's kinda drooly for about a half hour and then he stops and settles in. We also stop feeding him the night before big trips which helps, but we give him food after he stops drooling and he does ok. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This all took place in the mid 90's when I was about 12. My dad is a Pastor, and we used to live next door to the church in a small town of about a hundred people in the middle of a farming community. One night, I spent the night at my friend's house which was on the same block, about two houses away. I have no idea how, but I ended up sleeping all the way through the night, and when I woke up I was told something about a fire and that we were going to meet my parents at a breakfast for the firefighters. When we drove by the church, the back side of it was burned black through to the frame and there was smoke damage everywhere, not to mention water damage from the firefighting. Again, this was only a couple hundred feet from where my friend lived so I have no idea how I slept through all of it. 

There was an investigation as to the cause of the fire, but since it was such a small community with limited resources, the cause was never fully determined. It was just assumed that the fire started in my Dad's office because of his computer and other electronics in there. My grandfather was a firefighter for his whole career and he stopped by and looked at the damage, and in his opinion, he said that there was no way that an electrical short could have caused the kind of fire damage that the building endured. Months go by, things are returning to normal as the church is being rebuilt, and finally it's finished and we start having services in the church again. One day, one of the youth gets up front because he says he has something to say. My spidey-sense is tingling because this isn't normal, his whole family is up there with him and he can't look anyone in the eye. He confesses to burning the church, and my jaw just drops. I can't imagine any other time in my life where I've been as horrifically shocked as I was at that moment. He turns himself into the police, makes his statement, and then does community service at the church. He didn't go to jail because he was a juvenile. I can't remember if he had any kind of detention or not. 

Now the scary part. I didn't find out about this until much later, probably when I was 16 or 17 and we had moved away from there. My dad got a call from the police and they said he needed to come in to read the statement that was given by the guy who burned the church. He declined and said that he had already talked to him, and he was ok with it. The police insisted, and told him there was something in the report that he didn't know. My dad went down to the police station, read the report, and found out that the night the church was burned something else had happened. In the middle of the night, while I was over at my friend's house, our family dog started acting weird and insisted to be let outside. My dad got up and let her out and didn't bother waiting for her to want to come back in. After that, both of my parents said my dog was growling and making sounds that they had never heard her make before, like she was trying to keep something out of the yard. Sure enough, on the police report the guy who burned the church said that his intentions were to set my family's house on fire and kill all of us, but he couldn't get in the yard because he was scared of our dog (she was a husky-shepard mix). Another important detail- our house was covered in this foam insulation that would have engulfed the whole house in flames in no time. 

Since I wasn't told about it until later in life, it took awhile for it to sink in. Even though I wasn't home at the time, there's still a police report out there that says that someone tried to kill me. I don't know if you ever really get over something like that, but you use it to help you remember that life is precious and to take advantage of every day. 

TL;DR Someone tried to burn down my house when I was a kid with my family inside, but was stopped before he got the chance.

<TEXT> Amateur audio engineering. To have a decent setup you can expect an initial investment of a few thousand dollars which will get you an audio interface, cables, a microphone or two, and a digital audio workstation. That will allow you to record about one instrument at a time. If you want virtual instruments, expect to pay about $500 for a somewhat decent library, and then you need a MIDI keyboard or external controller to play them with. Then if you need effects for processing your signals you pay more, and if you need decent preamps you pay more, better microphones, better interface... and so on. Once you get to a certain point you have to consider having a dedicated space to record, and that means adding acoustic treatment for the room. To have enough equipment to record a 4-5 piece band with professional gear will set you back over $100,000.  </TEXT>
