Now I'm up to 212 and hate looking in the mirror. I got a fitbit and have discovered MFP which I've been using for the last 3 days or so. I've just been eating right and going for daily walks. I would like to get back into going to the gym to get a body like yourself but I have no idea where to start. What foods to eat, what exercises to do at the gym, do I write them down etc etc. Any help would be greatly appreciated! </TEXT>

<TEXT> When you go to multiplayer do you simply type in Altis life or you need a specific server address to type in which then downloads the appropriate files? I've been waiting to get this for like 6 months I'm praying its on sale today! lol </TEXT>
