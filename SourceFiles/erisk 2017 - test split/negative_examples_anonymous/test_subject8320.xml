<TEXT> [Kobaryo - Clock Control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnc6VykRI7E) this is the song that got me into the J-Core scene (that melody)! J-Core is a huge part of my life and I urge everyone on this thread listen to some. Now lets talk about Kobaryo.... He is so fucking talented!! 

* [t+pazolite - Pumpin' Junkies (Kobaryo's FTN Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQRsCXY5MGA) a caotic Speedcore song with both House and Jazz breakdowns

* [Kobaryo - Evolution Canceler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6j7qg4_5RM) a skull cracking Speedcore Crossbreed fusion! 

* [Kobaryo - Necrophagiatoast ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIxY7Yoqat8) insane 666 BPM Terror/Speedcore :)   

* [Srezcat   Kobaryo - Speed Complex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-Kcu7a-qUM) a fantastic Electro House track that turns into melodic Speedcore at the second drop, also Kobaryo = Srezcat
* [Srezcat - Expect](https://soundcloud.com/srezcat/expect) an amazing reverse bass Hardstyle song </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would love to represent the harder side of things!

Infernal Imp

Hardstyle/Hardcore/J-Core/Speedcore/Extratone

150-1000+

Typically I do 150-220 (some times over and I would only go to 1000 to end my set, I can be flexible with bpm ranges if need be!)

About 2 years, I'm not great but I love it regardless!

Traktor Pro 2 with a 1st generation s2

Edit: oooo onion chunks sound good maybe throwing in some spiced hamburger and instead of mozzarella throw in some cheddar (deep fried cheddar cheese curds if you want it greasy like Steve) mmmmmm poutine is sounding better by the minute, thanks /u/Slaide   </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's cool, the thing I like about Speedcore is how caotic it is. I'm talking Quarter, 8th and 16th note drum rolls at random, not knowing what to expect next, things like that. My advice is warm your self up to it. Start at a lower tempo like 155-200 then move up to 210-220 I did that for an entire day and it felt really weird but the next day I found a new appreciation for Speedcore and I could listen to anything, even Extratone. If and when you start to like Speedcore check out psycho filth records they are a lable based in Japan and they are my favorite Speedcore lable (they released this song). If you need help finding songs that fall under certan BPM ranges just let me know and I'll help you find some :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> ATM no :( I can kind of help you though :) ok first set your DAW too 300 BPM (Speedcore starting tempo) double the beat grid if you want to go to 600! Ok now you need a kick, sample, make or find one in a sample pack (I'll post a sample pack if you want 3) play around with EQing and distortion to really give the kick that personal touch! I don't know a lot about song structure but I will say this. BE SURE TO BREAK IT UP listening to a 4x4 kick pattern for a long time at high tempos will give even the most resilient listener a massive head ache so be sure to break it up with 8th and 16th stutters. As for the rest of the things ask around and message some of your favorite artists you'll be surprised who wrights back :)          </TEXT>

<TEXT> Having links to seamlessR's channel would be a start, some links to forums and good free sample packs, create a /r/edmproduction essential pack with samples and patches for well known synths like harmor, sylenth1, serum and massive (probably missing afew) and linking to really well known tutorials for things like side chaining and stuff along those lines  and putting all of those in a beginner tab would really help out a lot of new producers. Having genre specific sections would also be great i.e. hard dance most popular plug-ins, kick tutorials, lead tutorials, sample packs things like that </TEXT>

<TEXT> music threads are a great way for a community to learn more about eachother and what better way then talking about music from a game where lolis in rediculious getup's shoot absurd amounts of bullets at eachother! (you have to admit that sounds pretty hype and we're all about hype here ;) ) Ok so here's how this will work 3 of your favorite types of arrangements (because choosing is hard) 2 of your favorite songs and let's say 5 of your favorite arrangements (for bonus points post your Touhou waifu and be juged by the scrublord army). I'll start (it doesn't just have to be electronic, want to post your favorite Celtic folk arrangement? go for it man!)   

Arrangement type: Schranz/Hardcore/Hardstyle

Songs: Reach for the moon imortal smoke and U.N. Owen was her?

Fave arrangements: [Reach The Speed by Round Wave Crusher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7UVCxcW46Y), [Bad Apple by Shingo Dj](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU5SQAOdvIU), [Rabies by moro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqOiGJA1nSM), [Trick Gang by Thanatos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFEspH5qt94), and finally [Vampire Majesty by pocotan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEhqj6b1DPQ)

Waifu: [Momiji](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1871941?tags=arinu) awoooo~ 3

<TEXT> Put Pats lazy boy out of its misery by hurling of his balcony 

Put bags of rock salt around Woolie's place

Make Liam's body pillows come to life 

Rearrange Matts action figures when he isn't looking 

EDIT: I scrolled down and saw the stand thing, I would be a rotating stand! Every week I would change to a different user and I would have diffrent abilities! 

Pat: Help him control his anger and help him reach high places

Matt: Make it so he never drops things and give him the strength of the punisher

Woolie: Give him a salt cannon and make him not hate breakfast 

Liam: Help him overcome his fear of the booty and make his hair even more beautiful

<TEXT> It had a lot of things that turn me off anime *cough cough* INSEST *cough cough*... But seriously one of the main things I didn't like was the tone it was just inconsistent, it goes from goofy cat girl bullshit to horrible multination with no middle ground. The part that killed it for me was was the fight scene between Lucy and that other girl they both looked ridiculous which made it even more stupid when she says "my vector has a better range then yours" which I guess sums it up right their. TO MANY FUCKING CLICHS lets see: goofy sex stuff where another character walks in on them *check* Incest *check* taking a girl home with you who you just found at the beach with no clothing on instead of taking her to the hospital *check* building up a harem *check* having one of those scenes where two characters are comparing their powers in the middle of a fight *check* naked underage girls *check*  just too many clichs  presented with a completely straight face which makes the violence hard to take seriously (it is pretty raw I will say that though) also this is kind of a minor gripe but fucking cat girls with invisible hands coming out of their backs that are basically high frequency blades...... I mean really. It's late here.... So ya fuck you elfen lied </TEXT>

The Outside Agency and Meander (Ophidian's crossbreed alias) are two of my personal favorites, as for hardcore to hardstyle a lot of Endymion's tracks bridge that certain gap.

Sakura: sitar 1 (I love Asian strings!)

Harmor: I'm spacing on its name it sounds like some kind of synth that you would hear in a movie like blade runner

Toxic Biohazard: The underwater preset is pretty cool and dreamy

Serum: Any of art of fighters presets (he did a good job on them)

<TEXT> Recently I've been listening to the Highstreet allstars and I've noticed somthing. A lot of their songs use old melodies, like their track freeze is "what do we do with a drunken sailor" 3kings is (I'm spacing right now but it sounds really familiar) and rock that beat is an old Celtic song called "son ar christr" I think it's pretty cool when artists put a spin on classic melodies.

<TEXT> Niiiiiiicccce, good mastering on this, I have afew criticisms (if you are the guy who made this) the reverse bass sounds like it could be a little more distorted and while I understand what you are trying to do with the vocals they sound a little boring, maybe you could get a girl friend to do the vocals and give it that aggressive human element. Besides the two things that I mentioned everything else is their, good job on this one :)

<TEXT> Kick making :) as you can probably tell by my flair kicks are a big part of the music I make, weather it be the over driven sound of a gabber kick, the dry dusty omf of a gated kick (gated kicks are commonly used in hard trance), the aggression of a frenchcore kick, the power of a hardstyle kick or the solid thunk of a UK hardcore kick. Theirs something about synthesizing or editing one from a sample pack that is just so relaxing and fun, plus it's so cool to hear how just a little EQing can change so much about the character of a kick </TEXT>

<TEXT> Round Wave Crusher, he has a new album coming out very soon and he's the the person that introduced me the whole
J-core scene. I know a lot of people on here don't like fast music (200 and over stuff) but seriously give him a chance, it takes awhile to get used to fast music but once you do, you will want to hear more! Believe me I know I used to absolutely despise anything over 200. Anyways here's one of my favorite songs by him, the melody is so dark and catchy, may I present to you.... [Voices (in my head)](http://youtu.be/UWaCPTgUNsk) he also did a redo of this on his Unhinged E.P.

EDIT: also You, You just blows my mind on so many levels, he makes really good happy hardcore but at the same time he can do incredibly fast music very well. He also has anime remix albums up on his site for free, check him out at [foryousounds.com](http://www.foryousounds.com) </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Try this mix on for size](http://youtu.be/HIw1DsZD8NA) it's a tech trance mix, if you don't want to listen to the whole thing just look at the track list in the description, all the artsists listed make really good tech :)

And if you want to get into hard trance [heres one of my favorite mixes](http://youtu.be/erZJu-x41hQ) and a [mix I did](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/exploring-the-dreamscape) </TEXT>

<TEXT> As we all know 16bit broke up awhile ago and awhile later Eddie Jefferys came back as MoodyGood (bless him his sound design is amazing) but what happened to Jason? I remember hearing that he started making trap as "we are the 13" or something like that, theirs even a link to his SC on the old 16bit FB page but it's a dead link :/ so dose anyone know what happened to the guy? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello everyone! As the title says I need some help with making a subground kick, Specifically [this one](http://youtu.be/sYZcgn-sJho) it sounds to me like a big room kick with some distortion and some EQing to bring it out a bit, any guesses on how this kick was made would be great! Also if you make subground why not share some info on your kick making process (/u/audiofrq) I'm looking at you ;) thanks much </TEXT>

<TEXT> Have you ever met one of you favorite artists at a festival or in public? I haven't but man do I have a story for you. I went on a trip to Austria last summer (very nice place by the way) once I landed and left my gate I had some time to kill so I decided to look at the people coming through the gate. I notice a guy wearing a destroid hat but I don't think much about it, 5 minuets later I realize that guy was Excision (I kicked my self a bit but I got over it) later I'm browsing Facebook and I see a post that ken from the crystal method is coming to the twin cities to talk about production at a FREE class. Needles to say I was upset </TEXT>

<TEXT> My man!!! All right this should be easier to explain. Let's say you have your melody, pads and bass routed to channels 1, 2   3 respectively. You'll find a send knob/button at the bottom of each mixer channel, click on it and then click on the send of the channel you want to route too let's say 4 in this case (it should say for example route 1 to 4 in the top left corner if your doing it right) after you've routed all your channels you now have what is called a bus, you can now EQ, distort, compress and side chain everything that is routed to mixer 4 just automate the channel volume slider and bam their you have it :) all of your melodic elements are now side chained! The best part is that if you need to change something you only need to change the one automation. Busses are also great for blending percusive elements like kicks and snares, hope this helps! </TEXT>

I use FL studio because I love the piano roll and interface. As for the mentor someone who can teach me synth programming or give me ideas like "this noise would sound good for the fill" also someone to bounce ideas off of. As for the remix it is "voices in my head (redo)" by round wave crusher </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Hello everyone, I was just looking at the reddit comments for the drift stage video and I noticed that some of you seem to like retro/80's synth music. So please; sit down, make yourself comfortable, pop a boner and let's circlejerk about some music! :)

*unzips pants* I'll start, I'm absolutely in love with the hotline Miami sound track, all the songs just fit so well, their psychedelic but still danceable. As for artist I love Mitch Murder if you don't know who he is then let me tell you why you should love him, 4 words: [He remixed Guiles theme](https://soundcloud.com/daataa/mitch-murder-guiles-theme) </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Japanese stream hardcore 4 album preview](http://youtu.be/IZRvaeJUKjw) my favorite song from this album is clock control by Kobaryo, the melody is spot on 

[Massive Circlez 2 cross fade demo](http://youtu.be/IZRvaeJUKjw) all the Massive Circlez compilations are gold, most Japanese producers make all kinds of hard dance but the massive new krew consistantaly make Hardstyle so check them out

As for buying these... Well most Japanese releases I've seen are physical copy only and they are only available from various Japanese websites (so unless you speak Japanese or your browser translates it for you, you might have a hard time finding out if the CD's are still in stock / if they ship outside of Japan). the Japanese stream hardcore comps. Are on iTunes as for the Massive Circlez you might have to result to torrenting. I can PM you the torrent file if need be </TEXT>

<TEXT> In this off beat adventure set way up north in Canada a solider who is not well liked by his unit and a AI who wants nothing more then to destroy all of humanity fall in love and decide to run off across the small 30 mile island all while being pursued by the incompetent unit commander, the smoker, mutants with shotguns on their arms and the creators of the AI who know she's good deep down. Can our young lovers keep their gear from degrading? Will the solider ever put a point into psi powers so he can finally use kinetic redirection? Will the AI ever stop making fun of humans and their shitty skin and organs? I don't know maybe.... Ya maybe. Find out if your questions will ever be answered on April 11th, 1999 all while listening to a sound track that's made up of orchestral music and 1999 DnB and trance with lazy flanging to make it more trancy! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello everyone! you may remember me as the guy who asked for euphoric hardstyle needed in a [mix for a school talent show](http://www.reddit.com/r/hardstyle/comments/2itn3g/a_call_to_everyone/), well here's an update. Me and my friend decided to do our own things for the talent show, it was after that I got to thinking "why just show people hardstyle when there's a whole genre of music (Hard Dance) I could expose them too". So after some work I have made a mix and a power point, I'm going to do a live mix while projecting the power point behind me. Each slide will have the genre of the current song, facts and what song is currently playing. This is where you guys come in, [heres a link to the mix](https://soundcloud.com/infernal-imp/hard-dance-lession) [and heres a link to the PP](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-dST9JfmygNvSEaYppJVyBqe36W_bYfXJMalfE6xZjU/edit?usp=sharing), I've made it so you guys can leave notes on the PP in case I got any facts wrong. Thanks in advance :)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Never never never never compare yourself to your favorite producer/s it never helps the creative process and it will make you feel bad about your self. I'm an aspiring hard dance producer and when ever I think I have a good kick I remember how sweet and amazing ophidians, audiofreqs, zatoxs, angerfists, nosferatus.etc kicks sound and I feel so bad. Take your time, watch some videos (seamlessR FTW) and most importantly have fun because if your not having fun your basically working a day job you payed 600$+ for </TEXT>

<TEXT> This February me and my friend will get up on stage in front of 500+ high school students and play a 20 min DJ set. He will be doing 10 min of house and I will be doing 10 min of hardstyle, since most people at my school haven't heard of hardstyle I'm going to do a euphoric set as opposed to a raw one. With that in mind I want my set to be the best euphoric, harmonically mixed gateway into hardstyle ever! Even though I have a lot of euphoric stuff I still want to hear from you guys, so please link me some of your favorite euphoric tracks. Also, producers.... Do you have a track that you think 500+ first time hardstyle listeners would love? Well link me some of your stuff and I'll see what I can do to get your song in my mix :) </TEXT>

<TITLE> I asked Audiofreq a few questions </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-21 04:46:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 1.What are some of your hobbies? 2. Besides hard dance what other genres on music do you like? 3. Favorite food? 4. What got you into music as a whole? 5. Can I post your response on the hardstyle sub?


1. Hobbies, anything i do is geared towards improving myself and my creativity. Be that weight training (clears body and mind) reading up on art techniques (going through a graffiti phase) or minecraft (started a few days ago, experiencing a new world), I try to keep things varied. Might take up fishing next.
2. I actually try to listen to as little hard dance as possible. This is because I want to keep my 'work' fresh and not to be over saturated with the same sounds all the time. I listen to a lot of drum and bass and movie scores, but often house, trap n moomba.
3. All food when prepared with fresh, quality ingredients is awesome. I do have a soft spot for italian cuisine, but I love a good kangaroo steak too.
4. I got into music because once I heard it, I wanted to make it. Though this question is a bit like Alice in Wonderland, the hole goes as far as you want it to go....
5. Sure. Dunno if its gonna be that interesting tho.

<TEXT> Hello all! Yesterday I made a [monstercat anime post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Monstercat/comments/2gil1y/lets_make_a_monstercat_anime/) and from the looks of it, it didn't do too well :/, but I won't let that discourage me! (If this post doesn't do well promise I won't do more) so any ways here's the premise: make up a morning routine for you favorite producer (make it as bad or as good as you want!) I'll start! " Rameses was awoken from his deep sleep by the familiar sound of rain. He quietly got out of bed and went to the window and stared out at the cloudy Yorkshire landscape. "I could wright so meany songs about this" he thought to himself, and before he knew it he had been starring out his window for 30 minuets. When he finally snapped out of it he saw he was going to be late if he didn't hurry, so he quickly ran downstairs grabbed his crumpet with jam and rushed out the door. (forgetting his umbrella I might add :3) </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A while ago I saw this [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/sciencefiction/comments/2dx51k/ive_always_loved_the_scifi_style_album_covers_for/) about how cool looking pretty lights album art was. So I decided why not share some cool art but this time with a heavy/industrial look. Also for those wondering Vision recordings is Noisia's record label and for those who don't know who Noisia is they are a 3 man neuro funk/DnB group and I highly recommend them!

<TEXT> John Berkey was a artist who made [breath](http://www.fond-ecran.com/ORIGINAUX/divers/john_berkey/john_berkey_011.jpg) [taking](http://www.tucoo.com/fantasy/f_john_berkey/images/sf_john_berkey016.jpg) space ship scenes (and saying that isn't doing his art nearly enough justice). Now, some of you may be thinking "say this looks a little bit like star wars" well thats because he [did](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DuQ1FWS6Iiw/UR70HxsiF6I/AAAAAAAAdVw/3iMF1oTIWzs/s1600/star-wars-cover__john_berkey.jpg) do some art for the star wars movies. Also on an unrelated note John Berkey is the reason I know some one at VALVe and one of the reasons I got to take a tour of VALVe HQ    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dear Pat Powertuff, because of your expertise in the subject of RE4 I was finally able to beat it, I also learned a few things from your play through with matt: the Red9 is the perfect weapon for leading a one man crusade across "Rural Europe", the TMP is a hardened black turd (Although the ammo box is super hype), shotguns are mans greatest creation, knifes are great against crazy buff military mans, verdugos are SUPER cool!!, Salazar's whine when he gets stabbed in the hand is one of the best stupid noises I've ever heard, the broken butterfly is basically deaths scythe in the form of a magnum and finally separate ways sucks :( the only kinda good thing about it is you get to stare at Ada's butt the whole time.

Listening to Hardcore, Hard Trance, Hardstyle and Psy/Forest Trance actually helps me sleep while listening to Chill music by people like Mr. FijiWiji, Rameses B and Direct actually makes me less tired. Dose this apply to anyone else or is their just something wrong with my brain?  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My questions were:

1. Do you ever plan on doing hardcore (the non happy kind)?

2. Who are your musical influences?

3. I remember you said somewhere that you don't do collabs so if you were forced at gun point who would you collab with?

4. Can I post your response to the monstercat sub? Stay kawaii!!!!


Here's his response:

1. i really dislike the non-happy hardcore you're talking about because it doesn't 
 have any elements at all that i value in music, so no

2. mitch murder (synthwave and 80s music overall), dj shimamura, kz, early owl city.

3. i said i don't do collabs with just ANYONE. there needs to be some form of friendship established through chats or whatever imo. but if i'd have to pick someone it'd be mitch murder

4. sure. you too ()

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My questions were 1. Who are your musical influences? 2. Are any of your new tracks collaborations? 3. Can I post your response to /r/Monstercat?

Here's what he had to say:

1. I'm influenced by everything- both in music and through visual art! My older tracks just kind of happened, I just sat down and made them, no specific inspiration there!

2. No collabs- I work in a very drawn out way and I like to get things sounding exactly right before moving on, especially with my new music. I don't think many collaborators would be cool with sitting around for months working on something! That said I do have plans to work with vocalists in the future- but not the traditional "vocalist sings verse on track" kind of way, I'll have her sing whatever, and then chop it up/process it like an instrument. I like vocal snippets and how they can convey the emotion of a vocal, without actually having any discernible words. Looking to take that to the next level with my unreleased stuff!

3. Sure thing, fine by me!

<TEXT> I have been watching quiet a few videos from before 2010 and I have to say, the Melbourne shuffle is really cool and it makes me a little sad that its not as popular as it used to be. So /r/ Monstercat can we bring it back or should I ask /r/ Hardstyle about this ?   </TEXT>
