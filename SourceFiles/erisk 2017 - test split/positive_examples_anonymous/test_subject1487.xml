<TEXT> I politely disagree with Pennie not being the "best fit" for the band, because he was a lot better both technically and with understanding the band's dynamic range - better than most people off the street. As a live drummer for them for as many years as he had been, he was a good fit after Josh left and didn't really change the original rep too much. Yes Guns of Summer has a ton of technicality to it, but Pennie used to be in Dillinger Escape Plan, so it's not inherently surprising. For the most part, though, dude just kept time and did his job. Lol
I personally think that they started experimenting more with electronic sounds more because of Pennie (dude has a degree from Berklee in Music Production, I believe), which has helped their Afterman sound be what it is, but I think YOTB as a whole was such a drastic "experimental" turn from previous records that most Coheed fans wrote it off. There is some good stuff there, though. Minus the songs that were singles except for Juggernaut. Wasn't feeling them too much.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I play through Steam often, and the Mog Station simply registers your copy of the game under Windows. If you purchase the game through the Steam client,  it should give you a CD key that you affiliate with your SQ account in order to lock it to that account. 
As for buying time,  you can just pay though a credit/debit  card through the Mog Station as well. You should be able to redeem your time card in the same fashion. Purchasing a copy of the game would be necessary though,  as others have said.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> By higher level I meant 50 on. Should've clarified: I'm aware Shield Oath and Shield Lob both help increase hate, but I've never been particularly good at keeping hate 100% of the time (which I know is impossible, but I need to humor the idealist in me). Flash, as was previously mentioned, only does so much, but I really needed I think to utilize rotating through targets more. Usually I just spam Flash/Halone combo/circle of scorn -- then provoke on any enemies that aren't in range of Flash, but it doesn't always work, and whenever I'm not Tanking I always notice those tanks who more or less keep Aggro 95% of the time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys,


I was curious on how to maintain aggro most of the time in the higher level dungeons. Lately I've been having issues maintaining it, and spamming Flash isn't necessarily the best strategy. Would it be best to alternate between targets that you are attacking in order to maintain aggro? I've never really been completely sure of how exactly to go about this. Nobody I've queued with has really complained about it, but I've been wanting to learn to maintain it firmly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I played a few months before my SO, and she just got into the game about a month or so ago. She enjoys playing it, which surprised me. Since we are just getting into a long-distance relationship since she moved for University, she decided to play it so that we have something to do together; and now she's obsessed with Moogles. Go figure.

I think that if you can, you should tell her to at least try it. I agree with some of the things that people said in here, at least in terms of trying it. As the saying goes, "don't knock it 'til you try it." </TEXT>
