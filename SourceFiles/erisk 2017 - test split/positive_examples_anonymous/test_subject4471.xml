<TEXT> If someone asked your male friends "Would you have sex with whitestadultyouknow?" 9/10 will say yes. The 1 left is lying or gay.

But if someone asked you "Would you have sex with x y or z (your male friends)?" you would likely answer no (or correct me if I am wrong).

That makes it inherently a one-sided friendship. The man wants it to become sexual, but you do not. Friendships between men are two-sided; neither of them wants sex, since they're hetero. They simply enjoy each other's company and are not expecting anything more from the relationship. It is a more "pure" kind of relationship, since both parties are upfront about what they want from the other person - just friendship.

 I'm an amazing friend to those who deserve it.

How modest. </TEXT>

Agree entirely.

Good lord, the amount of people my age (I am in my mid-20s) who complain about not being able to find a job is staggering. Take a shit job and suck it up until you build some experience. Holy shit, they're practically giving jobs away in Alberta right now (I am Canadian). I never see the Chinese, Indian or other foreign students/20-year-olds complaining about a shitty job at McDonalds. They recognize they got to do hard work and put up with shit; they're not pampered. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wish you luck, but maybe the reason more women aren't interested in you is because you sound incredibly generic. "Funny, nerdy, normal" is all we know about you. Funny and normal are essentially requirements for even friendships...try telling more positive, unique traits about yourself.

And I don't mean "I also like movies and music." </TEXT>

<TEXT> This isn't for me, but for my brother. He was born with [sotos syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sotos_syndrome); a defect in one of his proteins at birth caused over-growth, but delayed intelligence. He is 16 right now but acts more like a 10-11 year old.

Me and my brother, the older siblings, are okay - no disabilities or anything. We're both on-off wrestling fans, but our little brother has been a fan for years. One of his favourites is Bret Hart and I am sure it would make the year to him to meet Bret in person (he's only been to a house show; big John Cena and Big Show fan). </TEXT>

<TEXT> To add to this anecdote, I used to work in telecomm, working on hydro (power in Canada) lines for the local power companies. While my own company is fairly small and was all guys, the power company was this monolithic public corporation, yet some of the supers were explaining to me they were having a hard time hiring anyone because (a) half of the population (women) never apply for anything but office jobs and (b) graduating college kids with engineering degrees don't want to work in some middle-of-nowhere city. 

These jobs pay a metric fuck ton with amazing benefits AND union support. You practically have an amazing job for life, yet no one wants to work on substations in Farmville Canada. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gretchen  Elliott had far more impact on Walt than any other character in the show, except for maybe Jesse. Gretchen was Walt's ex-girlfriend and Elliott was his best friend in grad school, the man with whom he founded Grey Matter.

As we see in the show, Walt wants to earn everything himself - when Gretchen's rich family helps startup Grey Matter (presumably, but never explicitly mentioned), Walt becomes infuriated and leaves her. In his chaotic and moody state after leaving the love of his life, Walt gets hitched to some random diner waitress named Skyler, gets her pregnant almost immediately and then goes and buys some boring suburban house like everyone else. Walter then watches for 16 years while his ex-girlfriend marries his best friend, takes Walter's research and uses it with Gretchen's money to forge a billion-dollar pharma company that should have belonged to Walter. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well the writers are clearly inspired by Macbeth and Richard III, two of Shakespeare's plays. In Richard III, Richard monologues quite a bit with the audience in the first act, but as the play goes on, he does this less and less to make him less sympathetic to the audience. By the end of the play, he does not monologue and the audience can see how monstrous he has become. </TEXT>

Or you can do the more bold thing and straight ask her out: "Sorry, I have to go but I want to continue our talk over a drink sometime, maybe next week. Write your number down."

Never ask them for their numbers. Always tell them you want their number, then hand them your phone. I get rejected far less when my phone is already out and it's staring the girl in the face.

Never be scared of rejection. It happens to everyone. Shrug it off and move on. </TEXT>

As for your picture in the OP, I could say maybe get a haircut or something, but looks are nowhere as important to women as personality and self-confidence. But definitely lose the shag - I can see you with short sides and a bit of styling up top. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think physical demons exist like we see them in comic books or Diablo 3, but are manifestations of bad ideas, thoughts, habits and activities. Like when someone did something bad they feel like they're "living with demons," when in fact it's just a sense of regret and foreboding.

When someone passes blame to a sort of intelligent evil mastermind behind everything bad, it does a discredit toward's humanity's own craftiness and tendency towards violence. Furthermore, why would God just let these little red-eyed devils run amok among his people if they have no redemption available to them? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT>  I heard some WEIRD and kinda DEVASTATING news about a pastor I know. Im in utter shock right now and all I can think of is: "WTF!?!!"

Later...

 The pastor, whom I mentioned above, 45 years ago, had a *sex change.*

Note the *italics.* Can you just *imagine* them talking like that in *real life*?

 Im not saying he isnt a *true* Christian...

I just *love* the italics.

 Im not saying its *wrong*, but its definitely *weird.*

[You can't make this up.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/2uifj9/im_reeling_in_utter_shock/)

In the comments we discover that: 

 Said pastor has been forced to resign, and separate with his wife, if he ever wants to return to the church.

If you read this thread, you discover he was with his wife for a long time. It's a shame that one's *dirty little secret like being a homogay* got spilled and now has destroyed one's family.

The top comment speaks on the issue

 That said, I do believe that God wants us to represent the gender he gave us, no matter our feelings of identity. He knows better than us. (see Deuteronomy 22:5) If a pastor, or church member is caught up in this, he or she needs to be lovingly confronted according to the instructions for addressing sin with our brothers. And if they refuse to repent, then church discipline is in order.

I am glad some people start calling it out

 What was the point of this post?

And the very poignant

 He's a trans person, not a cannibal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> OP you have never experienced the bad sides of relationships, so you cannot understand where people are coming from when they fear commitment. People like being in control of their lives and when that is slowly chipped away by obligations (yes, a bf/gf can feel like an obligation sometimes) they tend to run away or fall into a rut.

I love staying up late and working on various projects. If I had a girl there who wanted me to cuddle every night I would eventually go mental. I had to break up with a girl in college because she WOULD NOT LEAVE ME ALONE. I couldnt get homework done. I couldnt go out for a beer with just my male friends. She was so needy and a bit immature.

That is the fear of commitment. Giving up control. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sister, I have slept with prostitutes, apostated from the faith, taken drugs and have been drunk off my ass, yet it still amazes me how forgiving people can be.

Then imagine Christ, who does that every single time, no matter how low you get. He's always going to be there at the bottom to pick you back up.

I cannot lie and say there are no judgemental people, but we should recognize it is Christ who helps, not those people, thank God. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The article mentions *personal* questions, not fun nonsense you ask your mates when you're bored and it's almost last call. 

You should ask stuff like: who did you have your first kiss with? Where? When was the last time you cried?

I think the idea is you get to the *core* of a person's personality right away. Being with a complete stranger makes one start to sweat, you tense up. But then you're staring at each other, you can almost feel the body heat coming off the other person, so your hormones are starting to go wild. Now throw on very deep, personal questions that break into the core of someone's personality. The experiment breaks you down to your most vulnerable state, so you will naturally cling to the person you are with - or be entirely disgusted and retreat. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most people on Reddit, well the game subreddits, are teenagers and early 20 yearolds with disposable income, ample free time and no other obligations than homework or maybe a part time job.

When these kids are literally being bombarded and absorbing content like trailers, opinions and games for hours a day, they get caught up in hype. Remember when you were 20 how "intelligent" you were? Then do you remember how fucking stupid most 20 year olds are with their money?

This and many other subreddits (e.g. pcmasterrace) have huge circlejerks around preorders, dlc and certain publishers...but time again these kids buy up all the shit anyways.

<TEXT> Drop little bits of yourself, or your skills, interests, etc. when talking with them. 

I'm in school for 3D modeling and when I see a girl (or guy, since I want to make friends too), working on a 3D model, I just go up, "Woah that's really good. How long did it take?" The common interest helps break the ice. As the conversation flows, I drop little bits about what I may be working on (currently a Juggernaut skin for Dota 2), or what my dream game project is.

But here's the catch: I am shit at modeling. I only started this class two weeks ago. 

After I have talked to them about the program for a bit, or what games they're playing, I usually ask for their Facebook or phone number (or both). I'm now in several of these small Facebook groups with upper year students comparing their work, and here I am, a complete noob, just listening and learning. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If that what you got you missed the point. At the beginning of the scene (bit hard to notice in that clip), the guys are all complaining about poor sales, shitty jobs, etc. They're being negative.

Then the Alec Baldwin salesman comes in and tells them to essentially man the fuck up and stop complaining - use that energy to close more sales. Stop being down on yourself "I was a salesman, its a touch racket..." and rather go out and do your job.

While the vid is specific to sales, the same mentality can be applied to anything in life. No one is going to hold your hand. "Nice guy? No one gives a shit." Stop complaining, get off your ass and fucking go change something about yourself.

As for dating? Every guy is a nice guy. Every guy can be reasonably attractive with some effort. The problem is the shitty attitudes that run amok on this subreddit. Attitude is everything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Publishers ensure a few things like marketing, human resources, employee benefits, distribution for multiple platforms, international releases and not to mention the *funding for the next game.*

For every crowdfunded game like Minecraft or DayZ that does well, there are *hundreds* that don't even make it to Kickstarter. Go look at the Steam Early Access page and you will see just how much *crap* is on there.

A developer-publisher like CD Projekt have two divisions in their company. They have separate teams that work on marketing/distribution and then the actual game's development. An MBA doesn't know how to 3D model, nor does a concept artist know how to create an effective marketing campaign.

And you get 100% bet your ass that CD Projekt has outside investment (i.e. banks, investors) to help fund Witcher 3. Money doesn't just fall from the sky.

 Since when is it unfeasible to demand better service for our dollars?

It's not and I agree with you that we shouldn't have to put up with crap like uPlay, Origin or even Steam, all of which are DRM platforms (despite the pro-Valve circlejerk on Reddit). 

But you're giving all publishers the same brush stroke. You've become blinded by bad guys like Ubisoft and instead forget the hundreds of other [publishers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_publishers) out there that go completely under the radar. You know, the ones like Focus Interactive or Paradox Interactive, who just do their jobs.

And frankly I don't give a shit if Ubisoft releases a bad port every now and then. If they offered me a job to work in modelling or animation, you can sure bet I will work for them. They're a proven publisher with lots of money and job security, rather than doing the incredibly risky endeavour of starting one's own studio (especially when I have no formal experience yet). </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I'm no pirate, but if publishers want to be assholes they can get fucked.

Fine by me. Developers think publishers are assholes too. That's they're job - they need to be ruthless in this market. Publishers are business men and marketers. They're not gamers. They don't care if the game is good, as long as it makes money.

The blame often gets shifted to the devs. While sometimes that blame is due, how can a developer make a great game when they're expected to produce Call of Duty # every 12 months?

 Basically: go fuck yourself if you are a dick. If not, and you don't make shit overpriced games, I'll give you my support.

Yes exactly. This is what I mean by "vote with your wallet." If you like a developer and like their game, buy it. Otherwise, move on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey man, used to work at Staples in their tech sales and EasyCare department (where we fix people's computers). Now I work in the games industry.

For that kind of price you're much better off building your own gaming PC. For $900 you can build one hell of a gaming computer with an i5 and 290 or maybe GTX 970. That laptop has an i7 which is completely useless for solely gaming. i7's are designed to take on anything; unless you are doing video editing, 3d modelling or other high-end stuff, just go with a lower-priced i5 that will give you the exact same performance in gaming.

The main thing is the 730M GPU on that. It sucks, plain and simple. Good luck getting a decent framerate from ESO on low.

Another thing is that laptop has 1TB of HDD. While 1TB is a lot, you want to get ESO and Windows running on an SSD for WAY faster boot times. A HDD takes a couple minutes to boot, while an SSD takes about 10 seconds. Laptop manufacturers get away with putting cheap Seagate or Western Digital drives in laptops, as most people think "Wow, 1TB, so big!" When really, you can buy an internal 1TB HDD for around $30.

8GB of RAM is plenty. ESO does not use more than 4-6GB of RAM, even on my 1440p, ultra settings setup. Again, unless you're doing 3D modelling or video editing, 8GB is more than enough. I am a game developer, so I need 16GB in my PC.

The 15.6" screen is going to hurt after a while - you will get back strain and eye strain after looking at something so small. Take it from me, as I used to solely game on an ASUS 17" laptop (which is even bigger than yours). Once I moved to an actual desktop with a 27" 1440p monitor, I can never go back.

This build will destroy any game you throw at it. It will run ESO at 60FPS, 1080p, max settings very easily. And it's cheaper than your laptop. 

If you really need something on-the-go, just buy a cheap tablet on sale to access email and stuff. You're saving money with this build anyways. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mass Effect, with all DLC. Why? It gets "role-play" the best for a single-player game IMO. You really are Commander Shepard, warts and all. You get angry, happy, sad, depressed and joyful over the three games. The characters you interact with seem real and the stakes of your adventure, high. I have never been so attached to a virtual game character than I have in Mass Effect. </TEXT>

The new Star Trek movies, while okay on their own, did the same thing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> On board with you enjoying DA2 the most - I was engrossed in both characters and story in DA2 more than DAO. I dislike DAI, so I won't even mention it here.

To me, DA2 felt like it had the most fleshed out characters, each with their own realistic back story. You were this group of ragtag misfits in a city going through sweeping societal changes. On top of your companions, the main plot was unique among gaming - it was the story of a city, a populace, rather than some hero killing everything in sight. It felt like a true epic, a game version of Les Miserables or Tale of Two Cities. 

Knight-Commander Meredith was an *awesome* character. Her writing, voice acting, motivations; her entire character was well done. I have yet to meet a more interesting character in Dragon Age. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can believe DAI has a very high word count, as you have the main plot, the hundreds of quests and then almost 6 hours of party banter on top of that. And that's just voice acting. If we add in Codex entries, quest text and other written stuff...yeah DAI has a lot of writing.

But don't use "lines" when discussing writing. A line is arbitrary, based solely on the format the work is provided in. I have a big churchy-style KJV Bible and a little one for travel, then an even smaller (horizontally) one on my phone. The word count is the same across all 3, but the number of lines changes. </TEXT>

It says BI had 20k more *words* than an average novel, not pages. 20,000 pages is absolutely ridiculous, if not inhuman.

In comparison, the King James Bible has just under 2,000 pages with about 788,000 words.

 [Some classics are around 50-90k words](https://indefeasible.wordpress.com/2008/05/03/great-novels-and-word-count/), with some longer books being up to 175k. Let's say BI had 200k words. It still cannot beat a monster like Atlas Shrugged or War and Peace. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I'd prefer a sequel with a smaller scale story. But I trust BioWare.

I am all for the smaller story; I'd love a BioWare game with a very small cast (10 main/supporting characters) that have very fleshed out personalities and histories. Then you throw those characters into a personal, emotionally realistic and trying story for a great character-driven space "drama." 

But with the way DAI went, I am semi-pessimistic we'll get another Baldur's Gate clone (big bad, assemble team, do missions, kill bad). </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Reapers are powerful, they can prevent every single intra-galactic war just by their very presence. It's easier to include geth/quarians, genophage consequences without having to drastically change the plot than including Reapers as guardians.

You can still get away with the Destroy ending - in lieu of the Reapers, the Council makes the Spectres a post-Reaper peacekeeping force. Or everyone is more happy with the Destroy ending so we don't have intergalactic war.

I think BioWare is going to go where the other games did not, or barely touched upon. There was a ton of background lore on biotics, dark matter and the sort that we never really delved into. I hope we see more of the galaxy since there are *billions and billions* of stars out there. Maybe a visit to the galactic core, or even another galaxy? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Many are saying here that BioWare wrote themselves into a hole with the 3 different endings. I disagree; I think if you managed to import saves into ME4, either through a "Mass Effect Keep" or a direct import system, you can still make a plot that doesn't stray much depending on Green/Red/Blue ending.

Here's how I would do it:

Red: This is easy. Allied races rebuild everything afterward. AIs are offline for a bit, but are eventually repaired as well with more checks and balances (e.g. Asimov's laws).

Blue: Again, easier than Synthesis. Shepard's makes the Reapers move to another reclusive part of the galaxy in order to avoid further hostility (who would want to live near a Reaper?). Everything else is rebuilt, like in Destroy.

Green: Probably the most difficult to write, but it can be done. The actual level of "synthesis" was never fully explained in ME3. Did organics just get nano-like implants, ala Deus Ex? Or is it so extensive, does everyone speak telepathically now as a collective "mind-hive"? If everyone were a demi-god AI/organic hybrid, you might as well make an entirely different game series set in the far, far future. However, if we take the former approach of "less" synthesis, it can still be done. You just cannot center ME4-6's plot around the organics vs. synthetics theme in ME1-3. Make it about something else, where it does not really matter if everyone has these neural implants. Sure AIs can empathize now and organics can interface with computers, but we've seen these tropes before in other sci-fi (e.g. Deus Ex, The Matrix, Neuromancer).

The skill of BioWare's writers will definitely be tested. They will need to get creative, as to differentiate itself from the other 3 games and not upset fans.

We're going into a post-Reaper galaxy; changing political and socioeconomic structures, highly advanced technology, and (hopefully) greater galactic cooperation. I would not be surprised if we saw more expansion on biotic research, or extra-galactic exploration/colonisation. Maybe an extra-galactic threat from Andromeda?

For now, I'm content with my own fanfic ME4 trilogy; a story about a highly advanced "immortal being" playing with human biotic potential in a bid to stop the death of the universe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dear friends,

I had the privilege to do my first complete DLC-included playthrough over this past Christmas break. Beforehand I've only ever played Mass Effect when I bought it, with or without DLC. I'll spare the details, but I had a very challenging 2014 and was very down in the dumps. 2015 is shaping up to be much better.

I am kicking off my "new year" (7 days later), with the completion of Mass Effect 3. I played a Captain Kirk-like (paragade) man-shep, romanced Liara in ME1 then, for a change, did Jack in 2/3. Jack is an awesome LI, if you have not tried with her already.

Anyways, I finished ME3's final mission tonight after doing the "energetic" Citadel party. After I chose the [green ending](/spoiler), I was still feeling a bit down when the credits rolled (which I played M4 Faunts overtop) and rebooted my save.

I played the entire party again as the quiet version. In my head, [this was heaven for Shepard after he died at the end of Synthesis.](/spoiler) Just kicking back with friends. What a perfect ending to the trilogy with Shep's whispered line "The best..."

Thank you BioWare for keeping me company over the Christmas break, and creating the best game series I've ever played. Here's hoping Mass Effect 4 is even better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because creating realistic hair that moves with the physics engine (Havoc, in DAI's case) is very difficult. Look at Tomb Raider 2013 - they had that special TressFX hair and it still looked really wispy. Even in photorealistic CGI hair still looks off.

What most developers do is put on a heavy layer of post-processing on hair or fur. If you've played Far Cry 3/4 or Lost Planet, it is very evident. </TEXT>

It was the same in ME2 - where did all the mercenary groups recruit hundreds and hundreds of brain-dead drones to fight Shepard? </TEXT>

Why is Cerberus this massive force with unlimited soldiers, when in ME2 they were a small survivalist group? Why is Martin Sheen going on the all-out offensive, when before he used small squad tactics to capture highly valuable material? Why is Cerberus on Tuchanka? Why are they at Grissom Academy? Why are they on Sur'Kesh? Why are they fighting me more than the Reapers?

Don't get me wrong, the game is fun. Outside of Cerberus/TIM/Kai Leng (god he is fucking awful), the writing is fairly good. </TEXT>

<TEXT> An MMO should do one of two things - be honest and blatantly copy World of Warcraft, knowing full well it will never succeed World of Warcraft (WoW) - or create a sandbox where the players create the content (EVE Online). SWTOR, BioWare and EA foolishly thought to take on WoW's throne and they couldn't even make it up the first step before crashing and burning. All they made was WoW, with single-player KOTOR stories and some *okay* (IIRC) 16-player raids. They could have easily just created a Destiny-like game, or something akin to Borderlands; a story-driven game with player choice and some co-op.

BioWare could have easily created KOTOR with some multiplayer elements with the budget put into SWTOR. In fact, SWTOR was so bloody expensive [(estimates at $200mil+)](http://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-the-old-republic-cost-200-million-to-develop/1100-6348959/), they could have made a single-player KOTOR so vast, so epic in scope, it could have been their magnum opus. I think it was EA's interference that spurred the creation of SWTOR; they saw how successful Wrath of the Lich King and Burning Crusade were (the current xpacs at the time of development), and said "wow, people love star wars, let's just use WoW's formula and add Star Wars." Where have we heard that before, just in the last year with another popular single-player franchise?

From a game design and innovation perspective, most MMOs today are drastically outdated. Every single one is just copying Everquest's formula, World of Warcraft included. The only exception I can think of that takes full advantage of the massively-multiplayer environment is EVE Online, where by players run the economy and political structures in the game. 

We can argue that most games are built off previous games, as nothing is inherently "original." BioWare has essentially been remaking Baldur's Gate for the past 17 years. But that is what they're good at - creating interesting *character-driven, single-player* experiences. Not MMOs.
The MMO genre has been stale since 2004 - the year when WoW released and EVE was celebrating a 1-year anniversary. Unless you enjoy WoW, there is literally nothing else to play that is inherently different except EVE Online. Why would you play SWTOR, or EQ2, or ESO, or Age of Conan? They're all World of Warcraft, with some twists here and there, but they all fail to live up to WoW's amount of content, class balance, lore or player base.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Prophet does not care for the Batarians. The appearance they have as Batarian sympathizers is just a cover. In secret, he wishes to cause strife by hiding within Batarian territory and attacking human and Citadel trade hubs, putting pressure on the Alliance to go to war with the Batarians for "harboring" a terrorist group.

In truth, the Prophet wishes a war to happen between humanity and the weak Batarians. He sees a void of power amongst the Batarians and believes he can manipulate himself to their leadership using political intrigue and immense biotic power. He is confident his adopted son will hold the throne and eventually, make the biotic humans into a new god-like apex race, with the Batarians as their slaves
 All other races will serve or die under this new galactic order.

His long term goal is universal conquest through biotics and spacetime manipulation - he literally believes his son will be immortal as no other biotic has displayed the son's amount of power.

Of course the Prophet dies in ME4. ME5 and 6 take place decades after and follow this adopted son as he grows up and befriends your player character (who is the unexpected offspring from your ME4 love interest). The Sons are dismantled in ME4, but this adopted son becomes an extremely powerful biotic who (by the end of ME6) has the very power to move suns and create black holes
 Albeit he is unstable by the end, the two games would focus more ln the consequences of your actions in ME1-4; as offspring of your PC in ME4, how do you deal with relationships? Will you be nice or antagonistix? Join a gang with your biotic friend, or join C-Sec? It will be about choice, growing up and finding oneself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi all, I've been replaying Mass Effect again and have thought of an idea for the next ME4-6. Let me know what you think! I had the following ideas while doing my latest playthrough.

I just finished watching Place Beyond the Pines this past week too and thought "how come we never see the consequences years down the line of our choices?" Every RPG ends when the Big Bad Guy dies. The world is saved and that's it. Dragon Age tackled it a bit in DA2 and DAI, but it feels impersonal. You never see what happens to your character, his/her friends or family. ME2 tried it a bit as well, but apart from a few "Oh, Liara is on Illium now," it is not that fleshed out. What would happen if your character conceived with a love interest? Why do we take certain things for granted in a game like ME, like "where does this crazy biotic stuff come from?" I wanted to explore themes of religion, consequence, family  hope. So I hope you will enjoy reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it. I did get tired mid-writing, but I plan to write more.

~~

**Mass Effect 4**

We pick up about 15 years after Mass Effect 3. If you chose Control, the Reapers have finished rebuilding the Relays and have secluded themselves. Otherwise, the Relays were rebuilt anyways. You can pick your own race this time around. 

Your brother (or sister, if Asari), is a C-Sec officer on the Citadel. You get word they were killed in a large biotic suicide blast that has caused severe damage to the Presidium. Your sibling was scared, and believed there was an insider working for said terrorist organization inside C-Sec, so they turned to the only person they could trust - you. 

You are brought into the Citadel and take part in the investigation, having the only viable intel from your sibling. Your first squadmate is a Drell C-Sec offer named Roven (literally making names up on the spot), and close friend to your sibling. The bombing investigation leads you to a shipping manifest for materials used to make the same biotic-fueled explosive device. The manifest comes from Omega.

Roven used to work for Aria, and believes she may know who ordered the parts. 

Before you leave the Citadel, an aging, wealthy businessman (with a dark past) named Dondarion wishes to join you to avenge the death of his two daughters and wife killed in the explosion. 

Additionally, a Roven recommends tracking down Gaven, a Salarian explosives expert who may be able to help. After fighting through baddies who have taken Gaven prisoner for betraying a criminal organization, he agrees to join the team.

The Council gives you a small, cramped and rustic frigate called the Argonaut (a drastic change from the luxurious Normandy), for your trip. You now have a mission - track what group bombed the Citadel and killed your bro/sister.

If Shep helped Aria take back Omega, you arrive to find it undergoing reconstruction and renovation. Otherwise, it's a bit more worse for wear (like in ME2), but Aria still managed to retake the station on her own after Cerberus collapsed. Aria tells you the materials likely came from a renowned bomb-maker, a Blue Suns Batarian named Yosup. You fight through waves of Blue Suns merc before finally arriving at Yosup's compound. You defeat Yosup in a boss battle. You then ask him who ordered the bomb and then can choose to kill him or turn him to Aria. No matter which option you take, a human woman arrives and frantically tells you another bomb will go off on Omega. As she speaks, a violent explosion detonates in the heart of the city. Your party manages to survive as the woman shields you in a biotic bubble. 

The woman's name is Kolinya - she is a former member of a mysterious cult called the "Sons of Shepard." She had escaped and was looking for you. Back aboard the Argonaut, Kolinya explains the Sons of Shepard are almost certainly the group behind the attack. On the outside, they are a human extremist group of Batarian sympathizers. The founder is simply referred to as "The Prophet," is a powerful biotic human who left the Systems Alliance following the Reaper War. The Prophet left the Systems Alliance territory in search of meaning and stumbled across the Batarian religion, Vhar'shan, which preaches of strength and unity from [ancient Batarian scrolls.](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Kite%27s_Nest:_Pillars_of_Strength) The Prophet began intense study and came to his own conclusions that the Reapers were an apex race, but with them out of the picture, a void became apparent.

Kolinya explains the Prophet broke off from the main Batarian sect of Vhar'shan and started his own "Sons of Shepard." The Prophet believes that the post-Reaper apex race must be biotic humans. The end goal of the Prophet's beliefs, is biotic humans can eventually control the forces of the universe and ascend to godhood. The Prophet believes Shepard ascended to godhood on the Crucible and is the first of this new apex race. The Prophet, a powerful biotic, believes he will be the second to ascend. The Sons believe that the invisible forces of the universe chose Shepard, a human, to be the first of a new godhood which will rule creation. The Sons believe that mastering these forces through biotics, will allow them to join Shepard and rule all creation. They believe biotic powers have the ability to change the very laws of nature, therefore granting them the powers of gods. The Prophet concluded that the Reapers, despite their raw power, were unmatched to that of creation itself. What is a Reaper's laser beam to a supernovae, or black hole?

Kolinya shows the party a brief glimpse of the Prophet's preaching, in which the group recites their code: "We are children of the cosmos, the apex of creation. The Earth is our mother. The stars are our family. Our thoughts belong to the cosmos and with these hands we shall shape its destiny. Glory be unto the Shepard. Amen."

**Edit/continued 1:** With Kolinya's revelation, it becomes clear who the antagonist in the game is at this point. Your party must stop the Prophet before he begins a full-scale war between Batarians and humanity.

While on Omega, you discover Aria T'Lok was killed in the blast that has left half the station completely destroyed. You gain the help of a female Quarian bounty hunter named Jeema, who seeks the bounty on whoever killed Aria. 

The game continues in this fashion for some time, your party consisting of:

Roven - male Drell C-Sec officer. Similar to Garrus, he is a romantic interest for female PC.

Kolinya - female human biotic. A cross between a Liara and Cassandra (Dragon Age) personality. She is a romantic interest for male PC.

Dondarian - male human business magnate, on a quest for vengeance. He is a former smuggler and knows Zaeed Massani quite well. Possible fling with female or male PC, but no long-term romance.

Jeema - female Quarian bounty hunter. A cross between Boba Fett and that badass Tali. She is a romantic interest for male or female PC.

Gaven - Salarian explosives expert with eccentric personality. A bit of Mordin, Han Solo and Jack Sparrow rolled into one crazy package. He is not a romantic interest.

Over the course of the game, you discover there is an upcoming conference between Systems Alliance and Batarian Parliament leadership. The Prophet plans to bomb the proceedings and blame it on human extremists, hoping to instigate a war.

Your party arrives in team to stop the Sons of Shepard from blowing up the conference. As the members of government are thanking you, another bomb detonates and kills many. You discover the bomber, a rogue Spectre named Faraday, and he is not part of the Sons of Shepard, but is a member of the secretive Systems Alliance organization called SAICOM (Systems Alliance Intelligence Command).

Faraday says bombing the conference was necessary and will be blamed on the Sons of Shepard - his superiors believe a war with the Batarians is inevitable. Humanity needs a war with the Batarians in order to restart their economy following the post-Reaper recession. Faraday explains the Batarians inhabit many resource-rich worlds, but as the Batarians lack the technology or expertise to extract much of said resources.

The overall plan was to have the Player stop the Sons of Shepard from bombing the conference, as SAICOM knew they would succeed. Faraday therefore planted a *secondary* bomb that SAICOM *blamed* on the Batarians, in order for the Citadel races to be sympathetic towards humanity.

The Prophet was a former SAICOM employee who headed a project called BioHuI, or the Biotic-Human Inquiry Project. Faraday says the Prophet was originally going to be a human martyr - the public would rally behind a kind, caring biotics teacher if they discovered a Batarian was behind the attack. But the Prophet converted to the Batarian religion and was shortly fired from SAICOM, where he vowed vengeance and took off into Batarian space. 

The player then can decide what to do with Faraday; expose the truth, which would most certainly make humanity into the galaxy's black sheep. Or the player can hide the truth, thereby avoiding potential war and accept Faraday into their crew (as SAICOM believes Faraday died in the blast). An alternative is to still hide the truth, but murder Faraday. If you accept Faraday into your crew, he agrees to change his name and live under the radar.

**Continue Edit2:**

The player is now on the run from SAICOM agents, as well as tasked by the Citadel to track down the Sons of Shepard and eliminate their enigmatic Prophet. Faraday manages to locate the Sons headquarters - a large spherical station orbiting a Batarian red supergiant star. But the Argonaut is no Normandy - approaching the base directly would be suicide. Faraday proposes that the Player, Faraday and one other crew member pose as new converts to the Sons and infiltrate through a new recruit meeting, where you will see the Prophet himself.

The Player, Faraday and Crew Member get into the Son's headquarters and are shuffled into the main room. The Prophet emerges as a talking head on a TV monitor. The Prophet points out to the crowd of the Player's treachery and a fight breaks out. You battle your way through the Sons of Shepard base. The Player comments that many of the murals and depictions on the walls depict something resembling the Christian trinity - a "father," in the form of Shepard, a "Spirit", in the form of The Prophet, and a "son," in the form of an unknown young man.

You reach the end of the station to discover the Prophet had actually died many years ago, after the Reaper War. The Prophet now is a self-aware Artificial Intelligence, which seeks to control the universe through biotics. In its possession is an infant child, presumably the "son" depicted in the murals.

The Prophet AI, knowing full well it will be terminated, explains its origins to the Player if you have a high enough charisma/renegade/whatever.

Prophet was originally a man named Paul Sutton, a powerful biotic employed to combat the Reaper threat. Sutton worked for SAICOM, and was promoted to head of the BioHuI Project with the task of unlocking biotic abilities in children (very much like Jack and Cerberus), in order to combat the Reapers. When the Crucible emerged and SAICOM no longer needed BioHuI in its current form. SAICOM modified the Project's goals - unlock human biotics to help secure human dominance in a post-Reaper political environment. SAICOM believed humanity has a great chance of advancing itself to the forefront of politics, and biotics could help with war reparations.

Sutton became disillusioned with SAICOM, saying that BioHuI Project was just a cover for SAICOM's human extremism. "They are no worse than Cerberus, no more dangerous than the Illusive Man. Just now they have no Reapers to stop them and everything to gain," the PROPHET AI explained.

SAICOM fired Sutton, but that was not enough. Sutton threatened to expose SAICOM's extreme nature, so they attempted to assassinate him through a toxin. In a desperate attempt, Sutton fled and found refuge with the Quarians and Geth. But it was too late - Sutton knew he would succumb to his poisoning and, seeking revenge against SAICOM, pleaded with the Geth to upload his mind onto a machine intelligence. The PROPHET AI was born, with the goal to destroy SAICOM.

PROPHET rapidly learned more of biotics through its vastly expanded neural AI network with the Geth. PROPHET discovered the potential of biotic abilities - they have the potential to change the structure of the universe itself. PROPHET realized that the universe itself would end, even after trillions upon trillions of years. **PROPHET explained it's end goal was to stop death all together - both for organic species and the universe itself.**

"I would establish a new covenant in this creation - a perfect symbiosis between creation and life. With everything under my perfect command there would be no death, no gnashing of teeth or endings. Our universe would be eternal and perfect."

The PROPHET manipulated (or indoctrinated...) the first Sons, using Shepard as a religious icon to gather together the meek and desperate. PROPHET then bred himself a biotic son - a vessel unto which PROPHET could control the physical realm, while PROPHET controlled the digital.

The Player is disgusted by said revelations and had to option to destroy PROPHET through a virus provided by Faraday, or convince the AI to kill itself. Regardless, PROPHET becomes no more. The Player discovers the son, crying in a nearby crib. The Player can decide what to do with the child - kill it (in which case ME4 is effectively the end of the trilogy), hand it over to Jack's academy, or adopt it in secret.

Mass Effect 4 ends with the destruction of the Sons of Shepard base and the end of the terrorist organization. You are thanked by the Citadel. Finally, you are given the choice to oust SAICOM yourself, or let Faraday do it. Regardless of this choice, the Systems Alliance becomes embroiled in political scandal and war with the Batarians still looms as a possibility.

Thus ends Mass Effect 4. 

Coming up next in oodbot's trilogy, we'll explore the consequences of your actions. 18 years after ME4, your son or daughter, whom you had with your love interest (or off-screen lover, if none chosen), will be the Player in Mass Effect 5. What happens to the biotic, tank-bred boy? Will there be war with the Batarians? What happened to SAICOM? Was PROPHET correct - can one really control mass effect itself? ...and more in **Mass Effect 5: Generations.** </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Commander Shepard, assuming he/she has survived the Star Child encounter, is now living life as a recluse with severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He/She (let's just use "He" to save time) has gone off to live on his own. He has not seen his last love interest in years, nor ever fathered a child with said love interest. Shep has developed a drinking problem and (if male) has a gnarly beard because he doesn't give a shit anymore. He lives alone, reminiscing on the glory days; watching old vids, writing down his thoughts and replaying the events in his mind over and over (much like this very subreddit...).

Despite the destruction (which is the only ME3 end that allows Shep to live) of the Reapers, they still haunt his dreams every night. He remembers the death of all the people under his command; despite the trillions of people Shepard saved, he still feels immense sadness over the loss of loved ones (Miranda, Thane, those in the suicide mission, etc.).

In Mass Effect 4, set several decades after ME3, our player character is facing a new threat. He/She travels to Shepard's home - in a remote part of the galaxy - for assistance. Shepard offers some advice, but is too old and depressed to get off his/her ass to help. Shep, whos now this reclusive drunk, tells the player to give up. No matter how far they go to save the world, the world will slowly forget them and all their friends will die. All the killing and death will haunt them, so they should give up and go live a normal life and raise a family. Shep regrets being the saviour, as he feels isolated and elevated to this psuedo-demigod status where he is completely alienatesd from your average person. Most of his old squadmates have died of age, or gone off to do their own thing. He awakes every night, screaming of reapers and collectors, then cries himself back to sleep while trying to forget the next day with another bottle of scotch. Shep tells the player to forget him - he's a useless relic. He's just a man (or woman), not some invincible hero the universe has made him. 

Later, a main mission requires you to head to Eden Prime. Shepard volunteers to help - he wants to come, to finish off old demons. For one final mission, you play with the aging Shepard, as he battles valiantly through Eden Prime for whatever the particular objective is. You reach the spot where he first encountered the beacon in ME1 - where the entire series began. Your team is ambushed there. Shepard offers to stay behind, giving you time to escape. You eventually agree and escape to your ship with your two squadmates. Shepard stays where it all began and fights to the death. As he dies, he looks to see the escaping ME4 squadmates, but they've taken the form of his old crew. He smiles, then dies - peace at last 

If shep died in your ME3 playthrough...you get Garrus or some shit instead.

<TEXT> But if you met an alien you wouldnt know of they had a soul. How could you tell an alien "animal" apart from a "smart" alien? Our idea of intelligence is completly unique to our own human experience. To say whether an alien has intelligence or not is absurd at best, idiotic at worst.

What if they are a form of life beyond your human experience can comprehend? Some sort of multi-dimensional being, or a creature that communicates through a special kind of radiation? What if the very planet or stars were intelligent beings? It doesnt matter - they are beyond our capacity to understand and therefore, irrelevant to our salvation.

<TEXT> OP have you read any Stanislaw Lem? He deals with aliens in a more realistic and alien way than most sci-fi. I think your OP assumes aliens would be your typical Star Trekky or Star Warsish "humanoid" aliens, like the Klingon or Asari from Mass Effect.

Stanislaw Lem's novels treat aliens as entirely different entities - creatures so strange, so beyond our comprehenson, we cannot begin to understand, let alone empathize with them. In Lem's Solaris, the human crew finds out the alien they are studying is a planet-wide "ocean-organic," where each wave of this planetary ocean is actually a muscle contraction ( or so they hypothesize). The organism begins reading their minds and projecting their past, dead, loved ones into the world as ghostly abstractions. The crew starts going insane, but never in the book do they realize why the organism is doing this - is it communicating with them? Is this its way of speaking? Does it have goals or objectives, like a human would? What are those abstract shapes it creates with each [wave?](
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Symmetriad_3.jpg/250px-Symmetriad_3.jpg)

Lem leaves these things open ended in his novels. He is easily the master at creating truly exotic/alien life.

My point is that i don't believe the great commission extends beyond our own species. We don't preach to apes or dolphins, yet they show signs of intelligence. The organisms in Lem's novels are many millions or billions of years older than man, sgowing intelligence too, yet how can you begin to proselytize to such alien life? The core of Jesus' teaching is on love and empathy - how could I have empathy for the billion-year old, planet-encompassing nanobot alien in Lem's "The Invincible"? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Staples Employee here, also work in tech. Similar stories to OP with a couple I'll add.

 Many customers think RAM is the be-all-end-all of computer hardware. The more RAM you have, the faster your computer/laptop will be, period. Some look stunned when I tell them they're 12-year-old daughter doesn't need more than 4GB of RAM (standard in any laptop now) for her school work.

 Customers paying for $2000 Macbook Pro's in cash, when you can tell they're living off government subsidy.

 Customer couldn't understand why his onboard laptop GPU wouldn't support a 1440p monitor when a) it simply did not support WQHD (I googled it), and b) he didn't even have the right port on his laptop. He was there in our store for 3 hours trying to make the fucking monitor work.

 Got yelled at by a guy who claims we sold him faulty monitor cable. Turns out he thought his DVI cable would work as an HDMI cable, as his monitor did not support DVI.

 No, we don't have that Boxing/Black Friday Doorcrasher in stock. Stop fucking whining. Get here at 7AM like everyone else.

I like to complain, but I will be honest that our store doesn't get that many idiots compared to the rest of the retail employee's I've met. </TEXT>

Use PC Master Race's [pre-made builds.](http://www.reddit.com/r/PCMasterRace/wiki/builds) The "End-All" is cheaper than that website at $750 and will absolutely crush any game you throw at it @ 1080p.

<TEXT>  BUY them at a store in Skyhold.

Please tell me how. I am overloaded with useless currency.

 if you do everything there is to do. 

Like collect 10 hides or return a runaway Druffalo? These are literally quests I'm encountering 20+ hours into the game.

The only activity I semi-enjoy doing is closing Rifts, since it's easy, combat-focused and rewards good Power Levels.

Let's take a look in my journal right now actually...

Kill 2 guys for Cassandra in each zone.

Kill Venatori agents for Dorian in different zones.

Visit a grave in Hinterlands for some asshole in Redcliffe Village.

Kill wolves near a farm.

Close 0/2 or 3 rifts (x2-3 for each zone).

Is this WoW or a BioWare game? I don't recall doing this mindless shit in Origins or Mass Effect. I know Mass Effect had some grindy, shitty MMO quests, but you could skip them and do the main quest right away without grinding power level. </TEXT>

In order to do some of the companion quests (e.g. Kill Dorian's Venatori agents), you are required to return to the gimmicky, cow-clicky War Table in order to open up more areas of the map. Fuck off BioWare, let me explore at my leisure. If an area is too hard for me, idgaf, let me die. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never even beat Inquisition. Between the boring combat, fetch quests, empty open world, and shitty main plot, no desire to finish the game. Game of the Year, my ass. Aliens Isolation should have won.

 I just went back and have started another Mass Effect playthrough under "the man with no name...Zapp Shepard at your service." He womanizes and never prepares for anything. Looking forward to ME2.

Edit; thanks for the downvotes, ^fucking^idiots

I have 40 hours in Inquisition, more than my Origins or DA2 playthroughs. I am on the second last quest with no intention any time soon of finishing.

<TEXT> When my 970 FTW really works hard I do get a bit of coil whine but its unnoticeable when game audio gets loud (or wearing headphones).

Performance wise, I get 50-60FPS maxed at 1440p in the most demanding games. Crysis 3 at max, MSAAx2, gives me about 45FPS and that is easily the most demanding game on market. The only game that is killing me is Dragon Age Inquisition @ 35-50FPS on *high* (not max). Can you say *unoptimized console port?*

If I knew about the coil whine before, I would have bought another card and down the "FTW" overclock myself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow very solid build man. Ask for a 1440p monitor for Christmas, $300 from Korea (ebay) :) Do you have a disc drive to install Windows?

 Do i need a cpu cooler (other than stock)?

Only if you plan on overclocking your CPU (which the 4690 can do in spades). I have the same cooler as you - let's me get up to 4.5GHz on my i5.
 Do i need thermal paste?

Yes. They're dirt cheap and necessary

 minus an anti-static wrist band, anything else i need to fully build a pc?

Get an old credit card for the thermal paste. If you have a friend with a nice toolbox, ask to borrow it (or get your friend to help build!). </TEXT>

Far cry 4, dragon age 1/2/3, etc. All look the same 60 or 120 (I lower settings as I see fit to get them to run up to 120).

Strange thing is the testing website gives me 120Hz and games say the same thing. Windows says 120Hz. Nvidia says 120Hz. Even FRAPS and Shadowplay say 61+ FPS yet I cannot see a visual difference for the life of me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You get the same kind of goodies with other pre-orders; how is this any different? 

 Even if there's problems at release, they will be promptly fixed and all new content for the game will be free.

But how do you *know* this? Every developer has claimed the same, yet time and time again this is not always the case. 

Watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf5Uj4XIT1Y

What is with this attachment people having to developers? You don't know them. You don't work with them or for them. You pay them money for a product when it *releases.* Pre-ordering is so incredibly fucking pointless for digital products, it boggles the mind why someone except the most rabid of fanboy would go through with it.

I don't fucking care if Witcher 1 and 2 were great (they were). You don't work for CDProjekt Red. They could have entirely new management for all we know and completely fuck up Witcher 3. You don't know. All you have is this blind, unfounded faith in a group of Polish game developers. It makes no fucking sense. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am a game dev too, so I have 16GB in my desktop. I started with 8, and like I said, waited for RAM go on sale - which it often does. I'd suggest using the extra money to get the 290X now if you find a good price, then wait for RAM to get marked down in a few weeks for Boxing Day.

For Maya, Adobe CS, etc. 8GB is enough unless you're doing super heavy-duty stuff (like an extremely hi-res model of a Star Citizen-esque spaceship).

Unless if you need the RAM now, the 290 is still a great card.

And unless you really need 16GB ram (which is usually overkill), get 8GB for $50 less and use that money towards and 290X instead.

<TEXT> GPU is in great working condition, with a little wear on the back panel.

Acer monitor just bought Aug 2013, so still works perfect. Keybord has evidence of wear and tear (see timestamp), but otherwise fine. Samsung monitor is a bit smaller at 1680x1050, but works fine as well. All monitors include cables.

Looking to get ~~$160~~150 incl. shipping or best offer for GPU. Taking offers for other components.

Verified PayPal only, I will invoice you and provide tracking number once shipped. Also willing to trade for Dragon Age Inquisition + $$$

~~[Timestamp](http://i.imgur.com/VKatAal.jpg)~~ 8800 Ultra, ignore timestamp. Can't tell my own GPUs apart -.-

<TEXT> The best way to start would be in prayer and in the Bible. Pick a Gospel (I recommend John) and get reacquainted with scripture. Ask lots of questions and try to understand what the author is writing (or what Jesus is saying). Perhaps get a biblical commentary to help you understand the underlying themes and meaning.

Additionally, 

 I no longer go to church

Start going to church. Ignore that crap on the Internet about "existential Christianity" or "home churches." Find a real church. It doesn't matter what kind to start, as long as they practice sound doctrine. Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran, Baptist, it really doesn't matter since they teach essentially the same thing: God loved the world so much he sent his only Son, so that whoever believes in Him will not die but have everlasting life.

Ask your friends for some church recommendations or maybe go with them one Sunday. I know you're introverted (so am I), but make an honest effort, ask God in prayer, to get out of your shell and get connected with other Christians. Join a life/study group, volunteer at charity events and give yourself to the poor.

 Is it possible for me to do this in the comfort of my room

No. A Christian is called to go out into the world and *interact* with other people. Christ didn't sit in Nazareth and send people out to do his bidding - he went into the towns and ate with sinners and healed the sick.

 I'm thinking of contacting my old friend but I know she is very busy..

If she is the Christ-loving girl you make her out to be, she probably won't care and would love to sit down and talk with you. Make the effort, give her a phone call. Don't email her, don't text her. Call. Her. Phone.

Good luck buddy. </TEXT>

It's the Christian belief we are sinful and broken *by nature,*  This sinfulness is a condition we brought upon ourselves and cannot be rectified by ourselves. You don't even need a history book or a TV to see evidence of this - sin permeates all societies of mankind, big or small. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fuck you dailies.

Fuck you SPK Gaming. Shittiest guild ever. Kick me for tanking poorly after 6 days of 6hr+/day raiding in one week (when I sign up for 12 raiding hours/week), then you fuckers disband the next week. You guys fucking sucked a huge dick.

Fuck you PvP requirements for PvE cloak.

Fuck oqueue.

Fuck you Dread Wastes.

Fuck over a year of SoO.

Fuck some of my guildies who complain about their ilvl being low when they barely put in any effort. I fucking go from 500 to 566 in 2 weeks as a Blood/Unholy DK BECAUSE I LEARNED TO FUCKING TANK. I am fucking sick of carrying my guild for heirlooms (i am the only PvE player in the guild who has 540+ ilvl). </TEXT>

If the 4GB version works with the 2GB version (my current card), I can take one of those instead.

EDIT: ~~Bought one from /u/brictop~~ Scammer

EDIT2: Did some research AFTER I sent brictop money. Turns out he is likely a scammer. Called Visa and Paypal. Both said they'll get me a chargeback if I don't get the card in 2 weeks (standard shipping speed). Just a warning for others out there buying from this guy, use caution. Don't be like me and take people's word at face value. I'm just thankful I will be able to get money back. </TEXT>

<TEXT> FYI to anyone considering purchasing the account - Blizzard is VERY on the ball when it comes to account trading. They WILL track your IP address, password changes, etc. to the account and will give a temporary suspension, without warning, if they suspect the account was traded (which is against the ToS). It has happened to me twice and I would be very cautious when trading any Blizzard account.

I have traded accounts like elite dangerous and eve online in the past, but they do not go to the extraordinary lengths Blizzard goes through to stop account trading. You've been warned. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am a Christian and one of the last duties Christ gave was for us to go out into the world, preach the gospel and baptize people in the name of the Son/Father/Holy Ghost.

But the way these street preachers "spread God's Word*" is not the best way to go about doing that imo.

I won't go into it much since this isn't /r/christianity, but basically Christians should follow like Jesus did - he performed miracles, signs and aided people *then* followed up with his message as people inevitably asked questions. Most of the stories or parables in the Gospel are told *after* someone comes up and asks Jesus "Hey, Rabbi, why should I do y or how do I do x?" I never recall Matthew 45:16 "Then the Son of God went out into Los Angeles and held up a sign and preached to all the sinful nerds and they were saved that day."

*Funnily enough, most people think "God's Word" is the Bible. In Islam, God's Word is a physical book (the Quran), while in Christianity, God's Word is Jesus himself. The Bible wasn't even completed and compiled yet when John 1:1 was written...

<TEXT> Throne of Thunder is considered a Legacy Raid and uses the old loot system. You can run each boss, regardless of difficulty, once per week for a chance to get a Secret. Once you kill a Throne boss, your chance is used up for that week.

Siege of Orgrimmar uses the new loot system. You can repeatedly kill the first 8 bosses in LFR/normal for 1 secret per boss, for a total of 8 secrets.

Additionally, Lei Shen and Sha of Pride have a 100% drop rate on your first kill.

So if you're really unlucky, you can still get 9 per week. 1 Lei Shen, 8 from Siege of Orgimmar if you grind it out until each boss from Immerseus to Nazgrim drops one.

After that, you need 12 Runestones, which only drop from ToT Wings 3  4 and SoO Wings 1  2. Me and a guildie grinded out the Runestones in a single day, as we were very lucky with the drops from Throne of Thunder. After that you need the Heart of Lei Shen, which you can run Pinnacle of Storms again the same week as Runestones and he will drop it guaranteed.

If you have 0 Secrets, you can earn 9 guaranteed this week if you grind SoO 1/2 and kill Lei Shen. Say you are unlucky again and only earn another 9 next week: you will be unable to get the Cloak. You need to get at least 11 Secrets this week to even have a shot at getting the Cloak.

You have 2.5 weeks, as Warlords launches on a Thursday. Good luck. </TEXT>

2. You can get WoW to run a high-medium for about $500. I would suggest going to /r/buildapc and posting this same thread there. They will pick out the exact parts you need if you can (or know someone who can) build it themselves. This is your best and most cost-effective option.

Alternatively, you can get something from Amazon like [this](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0089KDCIU/ref=s9_hps_ft_g147_i1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DERpf_rd_s=center-3pf_rd_r=0YT7SJ0R85ZDVP3ZB0KZpf_rd_t=1401pf_rd_p=1880497982pf_rd_i=1000933821) or [this](http://www.amazon.com/CyberPowerPC-Gamer-Ultra-Gaming-PC/dp/B009RRJ1SE/ref=sr_1_1?s=pcie=UTF8qid=1414593804sr=1-1keywords=gaming+computer) which will run the game quite well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I read a while back that the government had this big tax break program for students to get their own laptops or something. Of course most ended up using their computers for free games like LoL, causing a Brazilian [Eternal September.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September)

Most Brazilians don't listen (or understand) to instruction, heed raid warnings or even know how to play their class. [In free games like LoL or Dota 2, they are notoriously worse, as the barrier for entry is access to a computer with Internet.](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1eluep/brazilians_need_their_own_server/ca1qkmp)

I think it has to do with language and cultural differences. Firstly, they cannot read nor speak English and therefore, are inable to read English class guides, communicate with English-speaking players or learn to play their class effectively. Secondly, South Americans, Brazilians in particular, are extremely proud (some would say arrogant) people - look at the World Cup for proof. If you try to offer criticism and help in a game, you either get Portuguese in return (hue), insulted or ignored.

So you have language barriers + cultural differences (e.g. patriotism/pride) + an Eternal September because of the supposed "free laptops" thing + lag = [a recipe for disaster.](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1eluep/brazilians_need_their_own_server/ca1hsmt) </TEXT>

<TEXT>  How can I better understand inflation?

The rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, and, subsequently, purchasing power is falling. 

As inflation rises, every dollar will buy a smaller percentage of a good. For example, if the inflation rate is 2%, then a $1 pack of gum will cost $1.02 in a year.

http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp

In World of Warcraft, currency devaluation happens due to a number of factors: an increase in quest reward gold, lower barriers to entry for new producers/extractors, 6.0 currency conversion and gold buying. 

The biggest contributor is the increase in level cap and subsequently, increase in quest reward gold. In Cataclysm, the average daily quest would grant about 7.5 gold. In Mists of Pandaria, daily quests would grant about 11-25 gold. 

Resources have also become more widely available to farm, specifically Ghost Iron Ore. Previously, we had to level mining to max to farm the highest tier of ore. This is no longer the case, as Ghost Iron Ore is available for mining at mining level 1, making the barrier to market entry much lower. As more people sell and buy the ore, more money is exchanging hands and in turn, re-distributing wealth.

Furthermore, with the low bar to entry comes new ways to earn profit by means of production. If I farm all the materials I need for a Sky Golem, an engineering-produced mount, the materials will likely cost around 10-12,000 gold at average market value. But I farmed those materials myself, therefore the cost is significantly reduced. I then sell that Sky Golem for a whopping 15,000 gold or so. Not only did I make a profit of 3-5,000 gold on baseline market value, but I likely made much more as I produced the materials. Those materials I farmed netted me a healthy profit and introduced more gold into the market.

Additionally, the recent 6.0 patch had converted Valor and Justice Points into gold, which will be used as the go-to currency. The average player received about 1000 gold from this conversion, substantially increasing the amount of gold in the economy.

Then there are "intangibles," or things we have no data on as players - namely gold buying/selling for real world currency. Right now, the average gold buyer sells 10,000 gold for $7-10. Let's assume $1/1000 gold for simplicity's sake. There are two kinds of gold sellers - those who manually earn their gold through farming (be it mobs or materials), or those who sell gold from stolen accounts. The former are doing the same thing our Sky Golem manufacturer does; they are converting raw material into hard currency. While buying gold from these people is still illegal, their method of producing gold is technically not illegal. On the other hand, stolen accounts end up hindering the economy by not introducing new gold; they simply redistribute stagnant wealth.

I hope this helps.

TL;DR Greater quest rewards. Lower market entry for new extractors and producers. Currency conversions. Gold buying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can run Siege of Orgrimmar normal/heroic/mythic repeatedly until you get a Secret from all 8 bosses that drop one (Immerseus - Nazgrim). Throne of Thunder has 12 bosses that will drop one, but you only get one chance per boss a week due to the different legacy raid loot system it uses.

In theory, you can get 8+12, for 20 Secrets if every Throne of Thunder boss drops one (but that is highly unlikely). Lei Shen and Sha of Pride are guaranteed to drop Secrets, so if you do not have time to run SoO constantly to get 8, you can get at least 2 for sure.

After you finish Secrets, you need to collect the 12 Runestones. You will have 1.5 weeks next Tuesday, as WoD drops on a Thursday the 13th, two days after reset. 

If you finish Secrets this week, you can very easily get Runestones done by running SoO repeatedly for 8+1 (Lei Shen), then again on Tuesday/Wednesday the final week. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My advice: ignore schooling, job obligations (if you have one) and nearby friendships - focus on your girlfriend first, since she is the most important thing in your life as I can tell. Is her timezone ahead or behind you? If ahead, skip school to get extra Skyping time when she is at home. If behind, vice versa. As a mature young adult, this relationship will likely last for many years to come and you should do your best to help foster that growth. School, job...these came come later (night school for example). Don't waste this opportunity for romance that some people never have. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would assume the animations are change server-side to be shown to you as proper third person animations. Think of it like this:

Your friend performs a melee. It looks good to them in first-person, but would look like shit, as seen in the video, in third person. The developer creates another set of third person animations that only other players see when you perform certain actions. When your friend performs a melee, that action is sent to the server client, which feeds it back to you, so you get the proper third person set of animations. 

If you played the game with the proper multiplayer third person animations, in first person, it would probably not play properly, if not look entirely fucked up to begin with (e.g. eyeball height, weapon size, field of view are all different when playing in first person). </TEXT>

<TEXT> The sidebar has our subreddit poll with our favourite books. Every book on there is authentic - not realistic, as we don't have their levels of technology yet - but authentic in that they feel realistic and gritty. For example, District 9 or Battlefield 4 are nowhere near realistic, but they are authentic.

<TEXT> You're trying to find your faith but reject any Christian-based teaching people here try to give you. One of the tenants of Christianity is about humility - it's about admitting your wrong and don't have all the answers. I pray that you will gain at least a piecemeal sliver of Christ's humility. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  does the bible say this is wrong?

Yes it does, many, many times.

 However we would rather have a "traditional" ceremony and have a house waiting for us.

You don't always get what you want. If you want to get married to her, do it. Have the ceremony later. You sound like a flake to me from your OP. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, compared to other old school MMOs maybe. But look at what people are suggesting - FFXIV and ArcheAge. Are you joking? FFXIV has what...3 raid tiers and about a dozen dungeons? ArcheAge maybe, since its emergent PvP content will provide some hundreds of hours.

But WoW has 16 tiers of raiding AND PvP content + professions + dungeons + questing + achievements + pet battles....I could go on. On my one account alone I have sunk over 2,000 hours. My old account (before it was banned for buying gold) had about the same. Still not bored with the game; I do have the occasional couple months break, but I don't seem to ever quit the game entirely. </TEXT>
