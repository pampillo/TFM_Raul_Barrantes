<TEXT> What I haven't seen addressed yet is if someone starts something violent, you have no idea how far it's going to escalate. You don't know what they're packing. Therefore you need to either run away or incapacitate your assailant. That's self defense 101, you. I believe you should always try and run, but if someone starts attacking you and you can't easily get away you are completely justified in incapacitating them.  </TEXT>

If we lived in an equal society we wouldn't need mens rights or feminism. I used to think that was the goal of both groups, but now I think they want to be better than each other. Both want their gender to dominate. It just seems odd and at ends with the origins of both movements. </TEXT>

I had gotten off on my medication I've before during the two years I have been on them so I knew roughly what to expect. I thought I could get them this past week, but my new job and school didn't give me any time to go to my hometown doctor. So now it's been a fee weeks and I feel again. The brain zaps have stopped too. I am supposed to start therapy again soon, but now I don't want to go back on meds. I feel good. I.didn't realize I was.zombied while on meds. I've felt so many emotions lately and it's great. Had anyone experienced something similar? I'm seeing my doctor tomorrow and I don't know if I want to start meds again. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was watching cosmos last night and NDT described the knowledge that all things are made of star stuff as spiritual. I've always immediately dismissed the word spiritual or anything people claim as spiritual. Now that I'm older I feel that spirituality doesn't have to be incompatible with atheism, but I don't know how they can coexist. Thoughts? How do you define your spirituality? Is it something intrinsically human that we as atheists are trying to suppress?  </TEXT>

Lately I've had the thought of taking shrooms or acid to see if that helps my depression. I've read lots of anecdotal trip reports where people claim if helped with theirs. I have experimented with psychedelics before, but never more than stupid swaying or mild visuals? Has anyone had the type of experience I'm looking for? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My therapist recently suggested a family group therapy session. Has anyone had an experience like this? Ideally I would like it to be me my mom my dad and my sister. My moms and dad only talk when necessary. I have no idea why they split and I think finding out like that would be very beneficial. I'm worried about tempers flaring and feelings get hurt and irreprebale emotional damage.

<TITLE> Stopped taking meds and things got bad. Can anyone just chat with me in this thread </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So i've been on lexapro for a few months and in the past couple weeks i got real lazy on taking it at the same time, which led to me missing days and eventually just not taking it when I ran out. I started skipping or cancelling my therapy sessions during this time as well. I think it's because of this that I let my school work slip and now I am failing all my classes. IT all culminated in a breakdown on thursday where i really wasnt sure what I was going to do. Suicide kept racing through my mind so instead I went on a long drive to try and gather my thoughts. In my car I found some papers from my therapy sessions and i read "Is the way you're thinking now going to help your situation"? Suddenly a light went off and I realized I needed to be an adult. So i've been back on the meds for a week and feel so much better. My only problem now is school, which my parents paid for. I plan to tell them very soon that I messed up school because I got off my meds. I'm going to offer to pay them back for this semester and pay for all subsequent schooling my self. I'm also prepared to give my car back to them. I work and pay for my own housing in a city where I dont need a car, so i think i can make it without the car and on my own if i have too. I might have to take a year off school for academic probation which is really scary to me. Has anyone been in a similar situation? I'm just wondering if what im doing is the right and responsible thing. I feel like it is since i was doing well on the meds and I screwed myself over by getting off. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Today I finally told my dad about all the mental problems I've had my whole life. I get stressed and depressed super easily, always feel anxious and have panic attacks and I know I've gotten more withdrawn as years go by. I can't keep up with school and work because I get overwhelmed and give up. I've been sent to therapy twice, once after my parents divorce and after I was kicked out of my universitys housing for paraphernalia charges. I never talked to the therapy either time and i'm really nervous about it. I've never opened up emotionally to anyone before and i'm scared I won't be able to. And what if I do and they tell me i'm just lazy and everything is my fault. Sorry if this is long and doesn't make sense. I would just like to heat from someone who has been in this situation. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Tips for pot smoking freshman. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-08-30 18:00:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was kicked out of kerr for paraphernalia my freshman year and I would like to offer incoming freshman some tips.

1 Never, ever, ever leave anything in your car. That's how I got caught. Dogs can smell a one hitter in your car.
 
2 Never leave anything in your dorm.
 
3 Make friends off campus and stash your pieces there. This is the easiest and best thing to do.
 
4 Avoid campus when you're riding dirty, especially north Texas avenue. Campus police love pulling people over.
 
5 If you are caught you will be kicked out of  the dorms, so be prepared. You will also have to go through substance abuse counseling.

6 smoke joints. They leave no evidence.

7 Avoid bike cops. They are the worst.

Feel free to post your advice here or ask questions. I want to help as many people as I can avoid what I went through. </TEXT>
