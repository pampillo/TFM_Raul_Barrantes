<TEXT> Hey guys, Celtics fan here pulling hard for the Rockets to win it all. Huge Harden fan. I'm wondering if anybody has a stat of how many total mid range jumpers the Rockets took during the regular season. I know they don't take many, even less before Josh Smith, but if anybody has the total that'd be sweet. Go Rockets! </TEXT>

I just want to ask about the girl Rachel. Is that actually how she is or do you exaggerate the awkwardness for the camera? Also when you get her for more than one segment (The Hunk and Quiznos) doesn't she start to ham it up a little too?

Thanks for doing this. Favorite show on television
