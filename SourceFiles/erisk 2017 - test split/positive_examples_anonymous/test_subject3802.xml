<TEXT> Try to think of your diagnosis like diabetes. :) I find it easier to brush of peoples ignorance that way, because I wouldn't feel ashamed or upset if someone tried to make me feel bad for having a broken leg or something, just laugh at them for being an idiot. At the end of the day, your brain is an organ and can get unwell just like any other.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for that. I think the hardest thing has been, after having the diagnosis explained to me and what the symptoms are, I had this epiphany-type moment where I went back through all the shit that has gone on in my life and, with the revelation of this disorder, realizing that every single episode was caused by me and me alone. My entire understanding of my past and my friendships has been completely flipped, and it makes me sick to think of the things I have done to people because I thought they deserved it, how I pushed people away and yet expected them to come back and save me. I'm so deathly afraid of the road ahead. Its bittersweet in a sense because for once in my entire life I have an understanding of the chaos that is inside me, but at the moment I can't see it changing or getting better (even though, logically, I know it can).  </TEXT>

<TITLE> I just got diagnosed with BPD and I am reeling </TITLE>

<TEXT> I'm a 20 y/o guy that has struggled with episodes of rage and depression my entire life. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder in 2011 and have been treated on the basis of that up until today. A few days ago I had my first major depressive/suicidal episode in almost two years and was admitted into a psych hospital after much convincing by my doctor (I could feel myself sliding into a depression so I decided to see my doctor to get a referral to a psychiatrist). After speaking with some of the doctors here they are confident that I have BPD. I never even knew what it was. After reading up on the symptoms, every single thing is applicable to me. Intense mood swings, splitting, issues in my friendships and relationships, impulsive behaviour, self destructiveness and suicidal thoughts etc etc.

I've been reading up on BPD and I feel so so much worse. I always knew there was something really wrong with me, and I thought it was Bipolar - I WISH it was bipolar because at least it is treatable. It feels like a death sentence. I cannot see myself ever finding love or holding down a meaningful friendship (my life is a long, smoking trail of destroyed and failed attempts to connect with people). I feel lost and upset and confused. I don't want this. Where do I go from here. FUCK </TEXT>

<TEXT> The issue is that she is practically living here and not paying rent. I do like her as a person, I consider her a friend, which is why the situation is so difficult/complicated because I want to resolve this without damaging the friendship. I probably should have mentioned this before but she was actually living here before I moved in. She was living here with Roommate B until they split up, and I took over her lease. They got back together after a few weeks which is when this all started. Putting her on the lease is not an option because of a few things: 

- the apartment is simply not big enough for four people (its a two bedroom apartment, and the room that I'm in isn't really a room)

- there is only three car spaces, with no other place to park within 3km (she currently parks in the visitor spot when she comes over, which residents aren't allowed to do)

- the landlord would not allow her back on the lease anyway, because she handled leaving so poorly last time (she basically just up and left and stopped paying rent - it was just luck that I happened to be moving around the same time because I was looking at other places before Roommate A asked me to take over the lease)

Having said all that though, myself and roommate A have discussed asking her to pay a share of the utilities bill when it comes next, based on her being here literally every weekend and having showers etc.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Me [20m] and my roommate [22m] - I'm on the edge of insanity (LONG) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-28 16:16:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **TL;DR: My roommate has no respect for myself or the apartment, does not make any effort to keep the place clean or contribute to the household in any way. His girlfriend (who does not live with us) is at the apartment basically 24/7 and does not respect the boundaries of myself or my other roommate. There is constant drama in the household, and despite my best efforts to tame the situation, nothing is changing   it is affecting my work performance and getting me down. I don't know where to go from here.**

I moved in with roommate A   roommate B in February earlier this year. Roommate A is great - I have been friends with him for over 10 years, and we rarely have issues between us when it comes to household stuff. Roommate B (who I had only briefly met once before I moved in) on the other hand is an absolute fucking nightmare.

So there are a lot of issues at play here; Roommate B

- Never cleans up/washes his dirty dishes

- Never contributes to shared items for the household (toilet paper, cleaning products, milk etc.)

- Refuses to do stuff like take out the rubbish

- Has a total disregard for the noise he makes when other people are sleeping (Roommate A   myself both do shift work and generally work weekends while Roommate B has a day job and weekends off, so he's always having people over for drinks   coming home late over the weekend and just being as loud as fucking possible)

These are some of the more minor grievances, which are sort of a non-issue because of one thing - his girlfriend. His girlfriend will come over and do his washing, cleaning, cooking, and buy his share of the household shared items (they have a joint bank account). But that is also sort of the problem here.

Roommate B's girlfriend is over every single day of the week - from the afternoon when Roommate B finishes work (~4pm) until late into the evening (10-11pm). As I said above, she'll come over   cook for him, clean up all his mess, do his washing and pack his lunch for work the next day. The only reason she goes home is because myself and Roommate A sat down with them and told them that she could no longer sleep in the apartment during the week (after she had slept there for 15 consecutive days). So now it just feels like they're taking the piss. She is here as often as possible during the week without actually sleeping over, so technically following the agreement we had made with them, and then she is here from Friday afternoon until late Sunday evening (and will stay on a Monday if there is a public holiday because 'its apart of the weekend'). 

This has been a constant issue in the household, and myself and Roommate A are constantly having to address it. The issue isn't really so much even the time she spends here, its the way she treats the apartment   the fact that she comes here not as a guest, but to basically live in the apartment (without paying rent or utilities). Further issues with Roommate B's girlfriend;

- She does her washing here (not all of it, but regularly enough to be noticed)

- She has her own bath towel   hook in the bathroom

- She frequently refers to the apartment as 'home' or 'our place'

- She will invite her friends to the apartment without letting any of us know (has brought them over for dinner)

And just yesterday she walked through our front door unannounced, with a friend, while Roommate B was not home (he had given her his key to get in).

So all this stuff is going on on a regular basis, just constantly building up my frustration at the situation and both Roommate B   his girlfriend's total lack of respect for myself and Roommate A, and then on TOP of this, every single weekend (or close enough to not make a difference) they will go out for a drink, come home and have these loud, melodramatic arguments that go on for MINIMUM two hours. This is not just bickering, its huge episodes where she's screaming and crying and threatening to leave him forever. If he hasn't cheated on her, he's spent too much of her money or he's taken drugs again. This is of course followed by them making up and having ridiculously loud sex. I haven't been living here all that long but I have already lost count of the amount of times I have had to go into work with NO sleep because of this shit. 

This honestly sounds like an episode of some stupid TV show and I legitimately feel like I'm trapped in the big brother house. I have voiced my concerns numerous times to the both of them on all of the above issues, and they say all the right stuff and it gets better for about a week, and then quickly descends right back into where it was.

I just want to be able to feel comfortable and safe in my own apartment. I want to be able to sleep   have my roommate respect my space and the apartment. I am on the lease until January and I am at a complete loss of what to do here. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Last Friday night I met up with a friend and a couple of her friends that I had not seen for a few months - after a few drinks we ended up getting our hands on some ecstasy and took a few pills each. These were the strongest ones I'd ever done and I ended up on a completely new level - it was fun and awesome, we basically just hung out at a bar until they closed at 7am. By the time we got outside I had started to come down, and after getting a bite to eat I started having mild hallucinations (likely due to sleep deprivation) and decided to go home. Up until this point the night had gone fantastically, but my friend and the other guy we were with instantly turned nasty as they wanted to keep going (there is a club where I live that is open 24 hours Fri-Mon and is generally filled with people that don't want the good times to end). They started taking advantage of the fact that I was coming down (both physically and mentally) and were trying to scare/guilt me into staying. I have only just moved to town so I didn't really know where we were, and they refused to give me directions to the nearest train station and even actively tried to make me confused/lost - I tried to get my bearings by walking the direction I thought we had come and they followed me, laughed at me and told me I was going the wrong direction. I was becoming extremely upset and just wanted them to leave me alone but kept my cool and did not give them the reaction they wanted - just pretended like that weren't doing it and gave them both hugs and thanked them for a good night when I finally got on a tram home (thanks to my phone).

Why do people do this? I have no issue with going on multiple-day benders but when someone decides they're done, why on earth would you try to make them feel like shit for making that decision? Because I was coming down extremely hard it really rattled me and I ended up in tears on the tram. It has truly affected the way I view this person (after being decent friends with them for 3 years) and I probably won't socialize with her ever again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, you can do this by shrinking the existing partition to whatever you desire (the minimum being the amount of data currently on it, so 400gb) using Partition Wizard in windows or gparted (from a live linux disc). You can then create an additional partition to install OS X to. 

Just FYI, it's recommended for beginners to install OS X on two separate hard drives as installing them on the same harddrive can cause issues that may be difficult to solve for someone that has never hackintoshed before. The OS X installer will refuse to install on a drive that does not have a GPT partition table (windows machines typically have MBR) and you will need to patch your installer to allow you to do so. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was suicidal I used to write letters to the few people I thought I owed an explanation to if I were to actually commit suicide. By the time I finished each letter, the feeling would pass and I would promise myself that I would sleep on it and if I still felt like doing it tomorrow, I would. Each time I would wake up the next day feeling really silly and dumb and continue on. I kept each letter that I wrote in a book. I wrote about 10 in all, and then a day came where I realised there was nobody else I felt I should write a letter to - which means I no longer had something to distract me from the suicidal compulsions I had. I left the letters on my bed and stood outside my parents bedroom door for about an hour, hoping that they would somehow be able to sense that I desperately needed help. They didn't, so I got in my car and drove to a stretch of road that I often travelled to clear my head, which I had never seen any other cars on at night. I closed my eyes and just put my foot down and let go of the wheel, ended up going off the road and rolling a couple of times before crashing into a tree.

What went through my mind? Nothing. Not to take away from what other commenters have posted here, but I have noticed a lot of people are posting about having a rough night and thinking about suicide. When you really make the decision to end your life, you don't think about anything. You have considered every single option and to your (irrational) brain, suicide isn't just the best option, it is the *only* option. An overwhelming sense of calm and clarity overtook me. My mind was blank. 

I walked away from that car with a couple of stitches in my head and back (crawling through the shattered windshield) and a broken finger. To say I was incredibly lucky was an understatement. 

Depression is no joke. If you think someone you know might be struggling, PLEASE do something. The thing that made it the most difficult for me is that I had reached out to people and nobody really took me seriously. My parents wrote off my behaviour changes and general deterioration of my mental state to being a teenager. Please, don't ignore shit like this. Suicide is a fucking horrible thing.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Wireless USB adapter issues </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-05 07:19:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm having issues getting my Wifi USB adapter to work. I previously installed Mavericks on my PC via Niresh 10.9 and after seeing how well it worked I decided to create a clean install USB and reinstall OSX (Niresh comes with a lot of extra kexts and random apps and I wouldn't really feel comfortable doing anything that requires me to put in a password on it).

The USB adapter I have uses a 8191s Realtek chipset, and on the Niresh installation all I had to do with download the Mac drivers from Realtek's website (used the ML drivers as they were the latest one). No issues there, all up and running perfectly.

Now, with the clean install, after installing the drivers and wireless utility app that comes with them (using the exact same install package that previously worked on 10.9) and then restarting (as per the installation instructions), the Wireless Utility app refuses to start. I open the app and I can see the icon appear briefly in the dock before immediately disappearing again.

Things that I have tried:

* Installing different/older versions of the driver (tried every driver available from realtek)

* Tried modified drivers from macbreaker forums

* Manually installing the kexts that are contained in the installer.pkg

All with multiple reboots - no dice. Still the same issue.

One thing that does stick out to me, on the Niresh install, when viewing USB devices in System Report, it listed the USB as RTL8181S Wi-Fi Adaptor, whereas with the clean 10.9.4 install it is simply listed as Miscellaneous USB device - which makes me think its an issue with a missing or unmodified kext that had already come with Niresh and I have yet to install; only thing is, I have no clue how to figure out what I'm missing. Is it a motherboard issue?

Any pointers would be great! </TEXT>

edit: in case anyone with the same issue comes across this in the future, updating to 10.9.4 fixed the cd tray issue.

The time spent serving is wasted prep time.

<TITLE> Hi /r/melbourne! I'm moving to Melbourne in January and could use some advice </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-18 09:14:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello Melbourne-dwelling redditors! I have plans to move to Melbourne (from the Gold Coast) in January and wanted to get some advice on a few things:

1. **Housing**: Firstly, I need somewhere to stay. I intend for the move to be permanent, so I am looking for something long term, and was leaning towards a house share with a couple of other roommates (so I don't get lonely). My question is this: I would really love to have living arrangements sorted before I head down there, but a lot of people I have spoken to have advised against making a commitment to a place that I haven't seen in person, as people will often post misleading photos on the internet and places are generally a lot less favourable when you actually get there. I'm also a bit worried about getting scammed and sending a bond payment to a person for a house that doesn't even exist. How prevalent are these scammers in Melbourne? Is this something I should be looking out for? How realistic is it of me to expect to have living arrangements made before I go down there? Would I be better off staying in a hotel for a few weeks while I inspect houses? Would people be willing to agree to let me rent from them without even having met me first? I thought having a Skype call might mediate some of these issues - myself and the ad poster would get a feel for each other and then they could give me a sort of 'virtual tour' around the home. Also, how early should I start inquiring for accommodation? I have noticed a lot of the Gumtree ads are looking for people to move in ASAP, so I don't think they'd be willing to wait for me to come down in January - but I really don't want to be leaving it to the last minute.

2. **Work**: As well as living arrangements, I would also like to have a job strapped down for when I get there. Many of the same questions apply here; how likely would it be for an employer to hire me based on a phone/Skype interview? I would like to start working immediately when I get down there. I have approx. 1.5 years worth of hospitality experience, the last 4-5 months of that being in a senior supervisor role - how marketable is this experience? Are there a lot of hospitality jobs going down in Melbourne?

3. **Transport**: This I'm not too worried about, but thought I'd mention it just in case I'm being a little naive. I've been to Melbourne about 5 times in the last 2 years, so I have a fairly decent feel of the inner city suburbs and how the public transport works. However, I will be without a license until mid February, and without a car until I can afford one. How survivable is Melbourne without a car? Will I be able to rely entirely on public transport (I would like to avoid taxis at all costs, those things are killer expensive)? I have no family or friends down there, so I have nothing to fall back on (other than taxis...) if I get stuck somewhere there isn't public transport. I intend on buying a bicycle as soon as I get down there as well, and I am used to riding around to get myself from A to B. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When someone is having an anxiety attack its important to 'ground' them. Usually resting a hand on an arm or a shoulder and speaking to them calmly will be the most you can do. Generally the person suffering the anxiety attack just has to let it pass. Just let them know you're there. If you realize they're having a panic attack, tell them. "You're having a panic attack. You are not dying. It will pass soon. Try to steady your breathing." in the calmest voice possible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not trying to be a dick here but... does it really matter? I'm not entirely sure why people on reddit get so upset about reposts. The entire idea of reddit is built upon linking to other websites, which can be considered "reposting". I get that it can take a significant amount of time to create a gif, especially high quality ones (I've just started doing it myself so I can appreciate the effort that goes into them), but unless the reposter is making real world $$$ from it, I don't see the issue. </TEXT>

I think that's a fairly honorable way to get donations and a little easier than trying to get people to send you money through PayPal (people trust google more).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just finished this book last night, I loved every second of it. The last few chapters definitely felt rushed, as though the author got bored of writing it and only continued because she had already spent so much time creating the characters so she may as well finish it. I don't understand why so many people disliked the ending. While I can see why people may find it unsatisfying, to have Nick or Amy kill the other would be completely out of character for both of them. I got the impression that Nick, deep down, knew all along just how much of a psychopath Amy was. When he figured out that she was framing him, his first thought was to admire the sheer brilliance of her plan. He knows that if his catastrophic love tragedy with Amy comes to an end, nothing will compare to it, for the rest of his life. He loves the depth of her intelligence, her ability to manipulate and weave stories of fiction into reality. 

No, the ending wasn't exciting - but it was realistic, and true to the characters that the author created.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Except the Pangu team used logic and critical thinking and decided that using the exploit for iOS 7 before 8 came out made rational, logical sense given that it was likely to be patched for 8. If they hadn't, ionic would have continued to withhold the exploit until 8 came out, and by then the exploit would be wasted. So now, instead of saving an exploit, 2 have been used because of ionic's childish kicking and screaming, and asshole apologists like you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was under the impression that ionic revealed to them a bug or vulnerability in iOS that they then exploited with their own code. The vulnerability may have given them access to the system, but they still had to code an actual jailbreak from there - a jailbreak often takes multiple exploits/vulnerabilities to access various parts of the system. So how is it obvious that they "fucked it"? Even if they had copy and pasted a ready bunch of code that ionic wrote, does it matter? Honestly he deserves it for being such a dickwad and teasing everyone with his jailbreak, and he was retarded to think that it wouldn't eventually happen given that he didn't take any precautions against it. Additionally, the fact that the Pangu team released the new version with a new exploit proves that they are a completely capable team on their own feet, and simply used ionic's exploit because it was likely for it to get patched out in iOS 8 and there was no reason for it to be kept secret (except, you know, to make ionic money...). The fact that Pangu simply re-released it with their own exploit instead, not because they were in the wrong, but because they can't be bothered engaging in childish drama, speaks volumes about their character - especially in comparison with ionic.

This whole thing is beyond a joke, I have never ever seen a community that is nearly as dramatic, childish and whiney as the jailbreak community. Ionic should be embarrassed.  </TEXT>

They had every right to use them, just like someone has the right to use code they wrote in a programming class.

In fact, I'm pretty sure the only way to get a nexus phone in au is to buy it outright, off contract.

<TEXT> Ota won't work with those changes to your /system partition. AFAIK the ota updater does a checksum of /system and compares it to the stock image of your current android version to see if it matches, if it doesn't it will refuse to install. Best bet is to update using the factory images (make sure to remove -W from the script, otherwise it will wipe everything - either that or just flash each image manually with adb). 

That or you can go ahead and undo all the changes you made to your system partition (remove cerebus and su binary from /system etc) </TEXT>

<TEXT> As someone that has attempted suicide before, and suffered depression for 4+ years, I think I'm allowed to make jokes about suicide. I love to make people squirm. 

Example: I'm going overseas for the first time soon and so I had to get shots for things like flu and hep a, but we decided against me taking the vaccine for malaria (comes in pill form instead of a shot) because it has a significant risk of causing a relapse in people who have suffered from mental illness (or currently are). When we found out about the potential side effect, I turned to my mum and said "So what should it be, suicide or death by mosquito?". She was not pleased.

edit: this is gold. downvoted because i'm being insensitive about something that happened to... myself? i guess humor isn't an acceptable coping mechanism on reddit.

edit 2: i am finding it extremely amusing watching this and my comment below swing between negative and positive karma every few seconds. looks like reddit is really torn on the appropriateness of dark humor. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Finally, an askreddit thread I can actually contribute to! 

I was officially diagnosed with depression in the October of 2011, after a suicide attempt - but I suffered from depression dating back to as early as 2009. I've read many of the responses here about exercise, diet and hobbies, and while they are very accurate and can be extremely helpful to a person that suffers from depression as a result of an event or life situation, sometimes extreme cases of clinical depression require additional life changes such as medication and therapy.

I've written about my experiences on reddit before, so I'll try to keep this short. I suffered from very severe depression for about three and a half years (my diagnosis has jumped around a fair bit because of my unpredictable behaviour and mood; things like bipolar II and borderline personality disorder were thrown around before they finally settled on clinical depression and severe anxiety disorder). Depression cost me countless friends, almost tore my family apart and has come very, very close to taking my life more than once. It is indescribable and if you have never suffered from it you will never be able to comprehend the depth of the despair a depressed person feels when they're at rock bottom. I used to fake a lot of smiles and laughs, and I remember the first time I genuinely laughed I immediately burst into tears; I realized - after years of nothing but a dull plateau that was occasionally interrupted by extreme spikes in both directions - that *this was how normal people felt all. the. time.*

Anyone that's suffered from a depressive episode and then started a course of antidepressants knows the way it feels when you start to feel normal... have you ever had someone sit on your shoulders for a while, and then taken them off? Once they get off, you feel so *light*, like you're about to float away. You just feel... good. Nice. Everything doesn't take stupid amounts of effort anymore, you can hold more thoughts inside your head, and everything feels warmer and moves quicker. 

I'm stable now, and currently not taking any medication. When you have depression, there is no beating it. It is just something I have to manage, and I will do so for the rest of my life. I know the signs of when I start to spiral, I have devised and perfected the necessary steps to keep myself safe, stable and functioning. When I see the signs, the first thing I do is let someone know - usually my parents - and ask them to keep an eye out for any strange behaviour and let me know. I know what the onset of a panic attack is now, I know how to keep my thought patterns in check and the kind of situations and people that I need to avoid.

Having said that, it's hard. Its really fucking hard. What is normal everyday life for other people is an uphill battle for me. Few people will ever understand why, while waiting for a train, I have to close my eyes as it enters the station. Or why I cut contact with my best friend because he has certain personality traits that have triggered depressive episodes for me. Why I say no to social outings sometimes, because I know that if I spend a lot of time with other people I have problems adjusting to being by myself again so I start to crash. None of even my closest friends get it, and in all honesty I hope they never do - because it would mean that they have experienced it themselves.

Its ok. This is my lot in life and I'm glad for it. Being a depressive make you see the world in a completely different way, and I like that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think people get caught up in it, I have honestly never seen anyone "freak out" about it though. Its important to follow it when you're first starting because it takes a while to learn when its appropriate to break the rule. Someone who has never followed the rule of thirds will not have the compositional skills as someone who followed it religiously and now knows when, and how, to break it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess so, but RR (or at least, the ones I worked at) are particularly bad (especially compared to say, McDonald's - I have worked there also). A few things off the top of my head:

* It is common to still serve food that has been dropped on the floor
* Chips are often served 30+ minutes old in a slow period - the heater keeps them hot but they are still old chips (they are sometimes dipped back into the fryer to freshen them up)
* Stores would regurlarly re-date the desserts kept in the fridge - it was not uncommon for customers to come back complaining about their cheesecake or chocolate mousse being sour/out of date/otherwise off
* When food was returned to us (due to a customer complaint) it would often be re-used (with us having no idea what the customer has done to it during the time it took for them to bring it back)
* Our gravy and mashed potato is just made from powder + hot water (this one ain't so bad, cause it tastes fucking delicious anyway lol)
* Rooster rolls are made using 3+ day old chicken that they were unable to sell. They are made in the morning and kept in the fridge until close and are simply microwaved when they get ordered - it is not uncommon to find bones in them (kitchen staff have to strip the chicken from the carcass when making them, and kitchen staff are fucking lazy)
* If you order chips without salt, there's about an 80% chance they will simply drop already salted chips back into the fryer for a few seconds and then serve them to you
* Those banana fritters that everyone loves - has anyone tried pulling off the crumbs to see the banana underneath? 95% of the time they're a mushy, black mess. 
* Gloves and hairnets are optional

The ONLY thing you should eat from that place is the roast chicken. They have good quality chicken, and it is properly slow roasted in ovens (although how clean those ovens are depends on how quickly the kitchen closer wanted to get out the night before) for about an hour. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The point is, the exploit they "burned" was one that many jailbreak developers used to find other, more difficult to discover vulnerabilities, since the exploit was apparently a very easy one that has worked on every iOS version since comex discovered it. Now that they've used it, it will be patched, causing any and all jailbreak efforts from here on in to take a significantly longer amount of time. You're probably right about them sitting on an exploit until iOS 8 or 8.1, but the problem is that now, they may not even find an exploit in 7.1 to sit on until 8, meaning the community will have to wait much longer. This also affects all future iterations of iOS, not just 7.1 and 8. </TEXT>

This means that features you have come to expect from custom roms (since they are in almost all of them) are not present, such as lockring targets and quicksettings customisation. In the mean time, I'm using Xposed with Gravitybox to bring those features to my device. Active Display alone is worth flashing for. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because Android runs on all sorts of hardware, its difficult to write native code that will play nicely on all the devices its available to. So, to combat this, Android ships with a VM - the Dalvik VM. This means that developers can write their apps in Java which are then translated into native code on the fly for the device. This extra compatibility comes at a cost: performance. ART is Google's effort to help lower that cost and increase performance. Instead of compiling the apps at runtime, ART completely pre-compiles all the apps on your phone (theoretically) making them faster to launch.

^ this is a very basic understanding and something that could have been Googled. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a framework that hooks into the Android system files that allow the changing of those files on the fly (versus flashing or overwriting the files for individual mods). This has many benefits such as ease of use, and increased mod compatibility - such as two different mods that make changes to systemui - instead of having to choose between the two mods (since installing one on top of the other will only make the last-installed one active) they can now be implemented side-by-side. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nothing that happens to you before 30 matters, in the grand scheme of things; it just doesn't. The sooner teens and 20 somethings accept that, the better off they will be, and the less suicides and depression will occur.

While I agree with you somewhat, let me also tell you why I disagree with you invalidating the way people feel as well. Life is proportional... as you get older, things that may have previously seemed huge to you are not quite as big. This is simply because you have experienced more. Take this [crudely made pie chart](http://i.imgur.com/U59ok5I.png). Say you've been in a relationship for 3 years. For an 18 year old, it is *proportionally* larger than what it would be for a 30 year old. That relationship ending, if we were to scale it, would feel the same way it would for a 30 year old to lose a relationship of ~5 years. It's a bit poorly explained, but hopefully you do get where I'm going with that.

The point is, just because things are insignificant to you does not mean that the validity and strength of the feelings that a person experiences is not real. I say this because at 18 years old, I have been through a bit of shit. And maybe it's trivial. Looking back now, I can see that what was going on was stupid and dumb, but hindsight is always like that. If I could go back to my past self and try to explain it, I wouldn't listen. The vastness of my feelings wouldn't go away because I told myself that it was insignificant (I even did so at the time).

So; I do agree with you. But you should never, ever invalidate someone's feelings. Because that will cause more suicides than people "taking what they go through far, far too seriously". </TEXT>

I'm not going to promise to eat my dick but I'd bet good money that the factory images that drop for the nexus 4 will start with 4.4.1.  </TEXT>

I've had my Nexus 4 for about 4 months now and never have I thought "Gee, I wish I didn't have onscreen buttons so I could have about 40 more vertical pixels"... There's plenty of room on the screen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Advice from just a kid maybe but, please listen to me on this; you need to take some time for yourself. Find someone that you trust to take care of your kids for a day or two, and go to the beach and just let the grief take you. Let it wash over you, let yourself experience it. Do what you have to do, cry, scream, break things - so long as you do not harm yourself (excessive drinking, drug use or self harm or probably not good ideas).

I guarantee allowing yourself a moment to truly take the loss will help you be stronger for your children. Because the last thing you ever want is to break in front of them, and take it out on them. I watched this happen with my ex-girlfriend's mother, and the effect it had on my ex-girlfriend was terrible and caused a few lasting issues between them.

Lastly. Take a breath. You can do this. You did childbirth, this is nothing. Stand tall and proud, and live the life that you know he would have wanted you to have. You are strong, and everyone here is rooting for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> iMessage works exactly the way as Hangouts works now, it just threads iMessages and SMSes in the same thread *on the device*. When you send an iMessage (blue) that message is viewable on any iDevice, including computers running OSX - this is because it is sent over the data network, through Apple's servers. If you disable data on an iOS device and send a message to someone, it will send as an SMS (green) and is *only* viewable on two devices - the device that sent it, and the one that received it.

To reiterate: **iMessage on OSX cannot send or receive normal SMS** - messages sent and received on the desktop are iMessages. With this understanding, Hangouts is already operating exactly the same way, and matches iMessage in functionality on the desktop - that is, messages sent and received on Hangouts are viewable on any device where you have access to your Google account.

edit: in reply to your statement about the Verizon messaging app - the reason this works is because, either way, Verizon handles your message. Your phone will send your message to Verizon over the GSM network and then Verizon will either: 

a) send it directly to the appropriate # (if the # is also on the Verizon network)

b) send it to the relevant carrier, who will then send it to the device

Because they are handling your message *anyway*, you can send and receive SMS on Verizon's website, and because they can match your account info with your #, it sends as your number. The way Google voice works is that you send your message to them over *data*, and then they send it from a # that *they* own (but is uniquely given to you as per their service) to the relevant carrier. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This has been asked numerous times in this sub. **You will never see this happen.** For this to work, Google would need to send every single SMS you send and receive to their servers and then serve it up in Google hangouts on the desktop - meaning that you would have to have a constant data connection for it to work, and SMS sent and received may appear in a different order on the desktop Hangouts than they do on your phone (unless the Android version of hangouts syncs with Google's servers, meaning that Google would get your SMS before you could even read it). There is no graceful or efficient way to do this, *unless* they do it in a Google-voice-esque way; which again would end up only working in the US and would require you to change numbers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a long-term relationship with a girl who was molested as a child (6 or 7 I think) by a close friend of her father's. I was quite shy so strangely enough all the sexual stuff usually initiated from her end. The first time she gave me a blowjob she went into a state of shock... I'm not talking just upset but like PTSD flashbacks sort of shit, she was shaking and it was like she was unable to see or hear me at all. I sorta just held her on the floor and kept saying "It's ok. It's ok." over and over again. One of the scariest things I've ever experienced and I would never have understood what was going on if she hadn't shared what had happened to her with me just a few weeks prior. 

There were a few more episodes like this whenever we tried anything sexual but we just took things slow and I made sure she was 100% comfortable. After a while she was pretty fine with anything and in the later years of our relationship she was quite a minx in bed.

Unfortunately we're not together anymore but I'm glad I got to help her through that little speedbump so now she can have a healthy sex life.

edit: thanks to whoever gave me gold. To everyone saying what a good guy I am, it's really not as amazing as it seems. I had a girl on my hands who was willing to push through extreme childhood trauma to ensure that *I* was satisfied (both sexually and in our relationship). Staying with her and working through it was an easy decision. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Are you talking about an OTA update or for when the ROM scene reaches 4.4?

If the former, you have to do the following steps:

* Flash stock recovery
* Flash latest stock ROM (if you are not already on it)

An OTA update will remove root and overwrite your radio (assuming there is a new one) so you will lose root and LTE.

If the latter:

* Nothing - When you flash a 4.4 based ROM you will have to wipe data though, so you may want to ensure you have some sort of backup. </TEXT>

Android version change - clean flash

ROM change (even if same Android version) - clean flash

Update to newer version of same ROM (but same Android version) - dirty flash </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow. As someone that was on the opposite side of this exact situation, can I just say that there is a very real chance that she was just as confused about what was happening as you and your friends were. Depression is a HELL of a disorder and when it gets really bad it can warp your reality to an insane degree. I hit a really low point in high school and as a result, I systematically destroyed every single meaningful relationship I had... No bridge was left unburned. You do this because you are so determined for the reality inside your head to match the one in the world around you, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Honestly I look back on that time and I couldn't explain half of my actions, your brain operates on an entirely different level. And I think your friend would feel the same way. Thanks for keeping in contact with her. I managed to reconnect with a lot of old friends when I started getting better and it meant the world to me that they stuck around.  </TEXT>

Source on this? Google is still actively developing AOSP. Calendar and Keyboard have both been released on the Play Store and their respective AOSP versions are still updated to the latest with every release of AOSP.

<TEXT> I posted in the flash Friday thread last week but it can't hurt to share again, in case anyone missed it.

**ROM Name:** Slim Bean

**ROM Version:** 4.3 Build 1 (09/15)

**Android Version:** 4.3

**Download Link:** [slimroms.net](http://www.slimroms.net/index.php/downloads)

**Kernel:** Slim-4.3-JWR-RC-1.1 (default ROM kernel)

**General Feedback:** I initially tried this ROM because it was one of the few ROMs that had a JWR+JSS hybrid kernel - I was on CM 10.2 nightlies w/ Franco kernel and I kept running into the JSS deadlock issue. I initially intended it to be a temporary thing but after running this ROM for a few days, there is nothing I miss from CM (read: SlimBean has all of CM's features) but I would certainly miss some features of this ROM if I went back, so it looks like I'll be staying for the foreseeable future.

**Hardware Comments:** Nothing really comes to mind... there have been no bumps in the road in terms of hardware issues, which is to be expected from a Nexus device.

**Features:** All of CM's features + way more (and their ROM size is somehow ~100mb smaller than the average CM release!). My favourite have been the way they handle custom navigation buttons/layouts (the UI/options for it are better than CM's implementation IMO, plus you can do things like have custom actions done on long-press of a button, which as far as I'm aware of, isn't available on CM) and transparent navbar and notification bar on the homescreen (which results in a simply beautiful [homescreen](http://i.imgur.com/c49K0Tk.jpg)). There are just so many more options for things, and it doesn't at all seem bloated.

**Stability  amp; Performance:** Both have been absolutely stellar on the stable release. On CM10.2 I was experiencing daily random reboots and keyboard freezes due to bugs in the JSS AOSP build - granted I was running a nightly of CM compared to a stable release, but CM only has nightlies for Android 4.3 ATM and I wanted to be on the latest. It just seems lighter overall.

**Caveats  amp; Warnings:** Honestly, at this stage, absolutely none. I've been gushing about this ROM to all my friends (well, those who know what a custom ROM is) ever since I installed it. I have only been running it for 3 or 4 days though, so there may be some hidden bug that I have yet to discover. </TEXT>

<TEXT> SlimBean has a feature called "The Real Dark Slim" which nightmode-ifies all the system apps on your phone (from messages to the play store). For this to work with gapps like gmail and play store, you have to flash the slimbean gapps (I think). This is because the setting just switches out the apks for the inverted ones when you turn it on and vice versa.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm in the market for an alternative messaging app myself, here's a few that I've found;

[88SMS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thinkleft.eightyeightsms.mms) - Pretty much the stock SMS pulled from Jellybean with some enhancements (such as quickmessage popup, night mode and emoji support)

[Textra](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.textra) - Quite nice. I used this for quite a while before switching back to stock.

[Pansi SMS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pansi.msg) - Has a very similar UI/style to iOS 7 messaging, I suggest you give this one a try if you like the iOS 7 messaging.

[Now SMS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=crometh.android.nowsms) - Google Now-inspired UI

[Sliding Messaging](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.klinker.android.messaging_donate) - This has the best UI out of all of the messaging apps (IMO). The hangouts UI and animations are just phenomenal. The only reason I'm not using this as my only SMS app is the fact that it freezes quite often. Really unfortunate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, clinical depression or depression that isn't brought about by a bad situation (where you are chemically imbalanced) can only ever be managed. There isn't really a "cure" or way to "beat" it, you just learn to live with it and manage it in a way that allows you to have a relatively happy life. For some people this means medication and others therapy (oftentimes both). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not entirely correct. A parallel for self harm is (arguably) drug use. Some people do it to look cool/for attention and others do it because they do derive pleasure for it and it is a coping mechanism... I am probably wrong here (I don't have a source for you and I'm on my phone) but I remember reading somewhere that self harm releases endorphins into the body in response to the pain, and people can get addicted to that as well. 

There are also the psychological reasons behind it, such as feeling in control (when the self harmer feels that all other aspects of their life are out of their control, so they self harm because they can control the pain and it makes them feel empowered)

And say what you want about attention seeking, but if someone is so desperate for attention that they feel the only way to get it is to deface their body, don't you think they need some help, regardless of the severity of their self harm? </TEXT>

She was co-dependent on me being depressed and miserable, and when I started medication and getting better the relationship started to turn sour. Then, when I broke up with her, she made me out to be some psycho and that I broke up with her because she was hanging out with a gay guy, when she knows full well that I left her because of trust issues we'd been struggling with for well over a year (because of *her* actions).

I loved her and genuinely thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with her. She was my best friend and soulmate, but best friends don't do that to each other, especially if they are supposedly in love. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love the new UI, but there is one issue that bugs me: with the previous version, when you launched the app it would automatically open up to the last screen/activity you had when you were in the app (for me this would often be all songs in alphabetical order). The new app no longer does this, and instead always opens directly to the "listen now" page.

I only use my phone to play songs in my car, so it is quite annoying with the new app, as it takes 7-8 taps and swipes to get to "all songs" when it previously took one. </TEXT>

Activating the SMS feature simply creates a new chat thread for each contact, so you have two for each one; SMS and Facebook messages. If you want to send them a Facebook message, you have to go to the fb one and its the same for SMS. It does not intelligently switch between the two a la iMessage.

<TEXT> This is frequently discussed in this subreddit and various other related forums. For devices that don't come stock with AOSP, the stock ROM will *always* have superior camera quality. This is simply due to the fact that the manufacturer has access to hardware binaries that indie devs do not. There is nothing you can do. If image quality is important to you, then you best switch to a stock-based ROM.

<TEXT> I didn't actually read the post. The whole issue doesn't actually bother me at all, I for one love the idea of including a File Manager and I'm in love with the UI. I was just providing the opposing opinion for the sake of discussion - and to say that bloat doesn't always mean a large filesize (although the two often go hand in hand). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bloat doesn't necessarily mean size, although I get where you're going with that. It more about whether or not its necessary. CM has functioned fine without a file explorer for all this time and nobody has complained or asked for one (that I've heard of anyway). I personally don't mind but its about the philosophy that cm has had up until now - people put cm on their phones to *remove* bloat and only have the absolute bare necessities on a fresh install, with the ability to install what they need/want afterwards. Including a file manager in cm assumes that *every single person that uses cm* will want and use it. Its not a safe assumption to make.

Plus, when do you draw the line? Would having a lightweight PDF viewer be considered bloat? How about a full-fledged eBook reader and manager? By adding a file manager to the default install, cm have changed their stance about bloatware from very clear to blurry and uncertain. Its not about the file manager, or the size of the apk. Its confusing their philosophy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Direct quote from the link in your own comment:
Android 4.1, Jelly Bean, is the fastest and smoothest version of Android yet. Jelly Bean improves on the simplicity and beauty of Android 4.0, and introduces a new Google search experience on Android.

Everything in Jelly Bean feels fast, fluid, and smooth. Moving between home screens and switching between apps is effortless, like turning pages in a book.
Jelly Bean features improved performance throughout the system, including faster orientation changes, faster responses when switching between recent apps, and smoother and more consistent rendering across the system through vsync and triple buffering.
Jelly Bean has more reactive and uniform touch responses, and makes your device even more responsive by boosting your device's CPU instantly when you touch the screen, and turns it down when you don't need it to improve battery life.

JB definitely *did* bring system-wide optimisations. It was the entire point of the release - to speed things up. Did you not hear anything about "Project Butter?" there was a 15 minute keynote on the damn thing.... JB should *definitely* be noticeably snappier. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Data wipe/factory reset only wipes /data and /cache, everything else is untouched - the internal sdcard is stored on a partition called /sdcard, which isn't touched in a data wipe, mostly because the sdcard won't have any affect on boot or apps and almost never causes problems. That and the fact that clockworkmod backups are stored there, as well as flashable zips. It doesn't make sense to wipe it, there really is no need. If you really want to wipe the internal sd card, reboot into recovery, choose mounts and storage, and then choose "format /sdcard".

For your other problem - it sounds like a gapps issue. Do you have the latest gapps? (gapps from 2012/07/06 won't work with CM10 nightlies from 18/10 onwards due to the 4.1.2 code merge) - the latest gapps can be found [here](http://goo.im/gapps). Download the latest ones, flash them and reboot, and it should work fine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Clear data for the play store and Google services framework, reboot. That used to be an old trick anyway. Why are you afraid of downloading / installing the new apk? Its signed by Google - it wouldn't allow you to just install it over the existing store if it wasn't, it'd give you an error. If someone opened up the apk and inserted something malicious, they would have to resign it and it would give an error before installing (because the signatures don't match). Its 100% safe. 

Either that or you could just download and flash the newest gapps package, which has the new store included: http://goo.im/gapps/gapps-jb-20121011-signed.zip </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't have that charger problem. The latest nightlies broke custom kernels, that's correct (I'm using an experimental version of Siyah) but this is not because of a failure on cm's part; they simply updated their code and custom kernels haven't caught up yet. The new code is Mali drivers, which means we are one step closer to having full butter (current 10/10 nightly is the SMOOTHEST this device has ever felt).

I don't know about dual booting. I do recall some people in the forums having issues. Here's a [link](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cm10i9100vsync/files/vsync_sysfs/) to the latest experimental kernel anyway. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cm focus on stability and quality rather than quantity. Since cm7 was such a clusterfuck of options and crazy levels of customisation, a lot of users didn't even know about many of the features it had. Since cm9 the cm team have decided to focus their efforts on producing a professional aftermarket os - they're aiming to make it feel as though this is the software that should have come with your phone.

I prefer cm10's simplicity over what I personally feel as buggy, although "feature-packed". (Please note that I used ics AOKP from build 31 onwards until cm10 came out).

Besides, what features does AOKP have that cm doesn't? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Only thing of note is the ability to expand notifications with one finger (instead of two). Otherwise its basically just an incremental update to cater for new iterations of the Nexus 7. 

Edit: as for custom ROMs getting the new update, cm10 is having the changes merged as we speak, and they should be in the next nightly (depending on your device). After cm merges the code, most ROMs will follow suit pretty quickly (AFAIK most ROMs are based off cm in some way) </TEXT>

<TEXT> CM themes are system wide - they theme the status bar and system assets such as buttons and highlights, a launcher can only theme the home screen. CM brings a bunch of features, custom lock ring targets, customizable notification toggles, weather and your next calendar event on your lock screen, status bar changes such as center clock and battery percentage, and custom hardware button mappings ( http://i.imgur.com/ISI09.png). 

The main reason people use CM is because its based on AOSP, which is (arguably) better looking - its what Google intended Android to be. It also allows you to be on the latest version of Android - ie I am currently running Jelly bean thanks to CM10, whereas stock SGS2 is stuck on ICS.

You will lose any touchwiz features. I haven't used Touchwiz in a very long time but things like the stopwatch and alarm clock and the notes app won't be present in CM. 

Anyway, the only way you can decide if you like a ROM is to try it yourself. Make a nandroid backup and give it a whirl for a day or so. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The past few months have helped me *really* get to know myself, and I've discovered that a huge character flaw of mine is that I just love helping people... almost to the point where I cannot feel happiness on my own, but I have to be making someone else happy to even feel okay. 

I've always been the guy that people talk to and I love giving out advice and taking care of my friends. I care way too much about people that don't care about me and its resulted in me getting burned time after time. I try to not let it change me into someone uncaring, because I'm only 17 and I know that I'm the nice guy at heart. I'm a little less trusting now though. 

So thanks, your words hit home and mean a lot to me. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know that feel bro. :( The only thing that ever really helped me was medication, and even though I feel I have it under wraps at the moment, it still resurfaces fairly frequently, and it only helps to increase my depressive thinking. I hope you find a solution that works for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, it wasn't easy. I didn't just wake up one morning and was suddenly ok. This is the result of *three years* of struggling, and I am still in the midst of an ongoing battle. Everyone's experience with depression is different, because its caused and triggered differently and affects everyone in a unique way. The steps that I took to get me back on my feet may not work as well or at all for you. I understand and appreciate that, but there is no need to undermine what I feel is an accomplishment on my part.

I also understand that depression can also incite feelings of anger or hate towards anyone that is remotely happy - I felt this myself and for a long time I hated everyone around me simply because they didn't feel the pain that I did. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me it increased the severity of my low points (my depression seems to come in waves, and when I started medication these waves were suddenly 100x more intense). But yes I think it also gives you a lot more energy and motivation, unfortunately fueling those suicidal desires. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, I think when you're so far down you just don't know where to start, medication is the kick up you need. I still take it at the moment, but my psychologist is considering getting me off them by the end of the year.  When I started on them, it was like day and night. You wake up one morning and its like a switch. You look around and just think... "this is how normal people feel?". While I felt this, it also increased the severity of my lows (basically making me bipolar while I was on them) and it was because of this that I attempted suicide twice. The ones I'm on now (mirtazapine) are much better for me I think. The only downside is it causes difficulties downstairs - something that has caused a bit of trouble between me and my girlfriend. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I totally feel you man. It's so hard at the start, when you suddenly realize how far down you are, and the climb to the top looks so hard. It is really hard. Its all about baby steps and focusing on what you have already accomplished instead of what is yet to come, what you still have to do or what you've failed at. You've already accomplished something today by reaching out to me - my feedback and even reading your own comment can help you feel better or have a greater understanding of your situation. I never liked keeping a record of things - I used to keep a (private) blog and journal, but I found that reading over my dark thoughts actually made me feel even more depressed - I was frightened of who I was and what I was saying.

Try your best to find someone you can trust. Don't hate them if they can't understand - if you don't understand what's going on with you than there's no way they're going to. Just let them know that all you really need is someone to listen to you. That's all you need. It gets better, there's a light at the end of the tunnel etc. I know it sounds dumb and honestly, when I was at my darkest I would literally scoff at advice like the stuff I'm writing now, but its so true. You need to understand and accept that you are viewing the world incorrectly, your perceptions are altered, skewed negatively. An important thing to do is try to observe your thought process. Actually listen to what you're saying in your head, watch how you react to things. When you truly start to do this, you start to realize how irrational some of your thoughts are, and you can start to try and change them. 

Good luck, and from one human being to another, I care about you. 3 Feel free to PM me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Through the help of medication, lots and lots of therapy and hard work. The first step is, as everyone always says, reaching out. You really do need that hand up out the hole before you can start doing things on your own. Its a slow and painful process, and for me it contained many many setbacks. But I pushed on and got myself to a functioning, happy state (and consistently feeling this way!). If you haven't reached out to a family member or close friend yet, I sincerely suggest that you do. </TEXT>

edit: since I believe my depression is the chemical kind, (not due to environmental factors) I understand that it's something I'm going to have to manage for a very long time, possibly the rest of my life. I'm okay with that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Hey r/android, please be aware that OP is not talking about the Razr Maxx, but is instead talking about the newer [Razr M](http://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_razr_m-4974.php) that is coming out soon.** OP should ignore all recommendations in this thread because everyone is talking about the **Razr Maxx** - they're [two completely different phones.](http://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=4974 idPhone2=4666)

OP: The Razr M has a smaller, lower resolution screen when [compared with the Galaxy Nexus](http://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=4974 idPhone2=4219) (4.3in, 540x960 vs 4.65in, 720x1280). It has an arguably better processor and but on the software front the Galaxy Nexus will offer a *much* better experience. The Razr M has a larger battery and a smaller screen, so I think its safe to say that battery life will be less of a problem on the Razr M than the Galaxy Nexus. You must also decide whether expandable storage is important to you - Galaxy Nexus doesn't have an SD card slot while the Razr M does.

Personally, I'd go the Galaxy Nexus. Guaranteed software updates for at least the next two major versions of Android + a bigger and better resolution screen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd recommend both of those things (SiyahKernel + CM10) but honestly, the only way you're gonna be able to tell is just try it for yourself. Make a nandroid and test it for a day or two, and if you like it then keep it. Everyone's experience is different.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 100% agree with you. From a consumer perspective, its a perfect solution - in typical Apple fashion, too. Sure we can rant and rave about how non-standards-compliant or compatible it is, but at the end of the day, Apple has provided a solution to an existing problem - however limiting that solution may be. Its excellent for Apple; not so good for the rest of mobile technology. Apple has never seemed to give a fuck about anything other than profit though. This ties in perfectly with their existing vision. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Perhaps. There doesn't seem to be anything other than anecdotal evidence on the topic. Many of my friends use (or did, until they switched to iPhone) Nokias and a few have used Samsung (non-android) phones (with some sort of Java-based OS), and this problem has occurred. (In Australia, on various telcos, if that makes any difference). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its sad how true this is. I almost feel like its an underhanded way of enticing users to buy into the platform - so many times I've seen people with Android phones receive MMSes from iPhones with this issue, they mention it to the person who sent it to them next time they see them, and the person laughs and says something along the lines "oh well, it wouldn't happen if you had an iPhone." - so people start to think its a problem with their phone, not the other way around.  </TEXT>

Things aren't happening to throw you back into your depression - sure, it seems like that, but depression is a failure in thinking and correctly assessing situations. Your depression is overwhelming you, it is using these things that happen in your life as an excuse to get the better of you. People are shit. Its a fact. People will always fuck you over. Find people that don't and don't fuck them over either.

Is there anything specific that has made you feel this way at the moment?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Congratulations on finding a release. Now you know what helps you, the only thing you need to focus on is finding the motivation to do it when you start feeling down (I often find that's the hardest part. Doing things you know will make you feel better - sometimes you just don't want to.)

I find bike riding, playing video games and watching a particular scary movie achieves this for me. Be careful you don't cross the line into escapism though - by merely using these things as a "distraction" instead of actual stress relief, you are simply ignoring your problems and letting them get bigger. When I was really bad, I would play video games or go for a really exerting bike ride, but I would only feel better *while* I was doing these things - the second I stopped and my mind wandered from the task at hand, I immediately felt like shit.

Anyway, hope you're having a fantastic night. :) Thanks for sharing your awesome news with us. </TEXT>

<TITLE> YN-460 Speedlite for first external flash? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-09-04 14:04:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey there r/photography. Recently I've been wanting to get an external flash because I feel limited with what I can currently do with the onboard one (I like to do a lot of portraiture). I currently use a Canon 20D and I'm on a pretty tight budget. I was wondering if the [YN-460](http://www.ebay.com/itm/YONGNUO-Speedlite-YN460-Canon-EOS-Rebel-XT-XTi-XTs-/160593250447?_trksid=p5197.m1992 _trkparms=aid%3D111000%26algo%3DREC.CURRENT%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D14%26meid%3D1806658724969685563%26pid%3D100015%26prg%3D1006%26rk%3D3%26) would be suitable for my needs? I mostly do a lot of indoor portraiture.

I was also considering getting a stand/tripod I could mount the flash on (use it as slave). Would [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Hot-Shoe-Flash-to-Bracket-stand-Mount-Adapter-Trigger-/220982002387?pt=Camera_Flash_Accessories hash=item33738dc2d3) and [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/656-200cm-PROFESSIONAL-Light-Stand-Tripod-for-Photo-Studio-Video-Lighting-2m-/290764698956?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0 hash=item43b2ed354c) do the job?

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I replied to your comment I thought you just were talking about how the original AOKP toggles take up too much space, especially since they can't be hidden in the JB notification shade. I was just saying that there is an implementation that takes up as much space as CM's. The only differing aspect of the appearance that I can see is the lines underneath? Otherwise they're pretty much exactly the same. </TEXT>

Its DPI changing interface is the only thing I know that can change from phone to tablet UI without requiring a reboot (it simply restarts the framework-ui, which takes a few seconds)

OP, your best bet is to install PA and just change to the tablet UI when you need it. It only takes a few seconds. </TEXT>

You didn't link it in the initial comment, like I had said. You only provided a link after I commented, and I'm sure it was only because you Googled the information after you read my comment - something you should have done before posting and assuming OP is stupid and treating him like so. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I politely disagree.

Maybe you're seeing different kind of therapists to me, but I think they provide a wonderful service. Let me tell you why.

Going to a therapist is shit. Even if its helped you at some point, everyone has to admit its awkward, feels pointless and embarrassing. You feel like you're wasting everyone's time and money. Even now, with the knowledge that therapy has helped me make HUGE headway in my recovery, I still dread going to see him. 

But the thing is, every now and then, there's that one session. You walk in, and you just gush and gush and gush. And even if they say something you think is stupid, or you disagree with, the fact that you've got someone there to bounce ideas and solutions for problems you may be experiencing off, is the best feeling. Even if you go to 100 sessions and only 1 of them is like that, it is 100% worth it.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Weird text issue with Chrome (text clipping? not sure what to call it) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-08-20 13:09:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been having a weird problem recently, I'm not sure exactly when it started occurring (ie whether or not it began with a recent update to Chrome or some significant change in my system). Anyways, basically what happens is that on some sites, for example on Youtube, I get this weird text clipping issue where half of some of the characters appears to be clipped off/missing. Here's a screenshot http://i.imgur.com/GX996.png (notice the clipped letters in the comment, the most obvious one being the "E"). As you can see I'm running Windows 7.

I assume its either a font issue or something to do with something called Windows Cleartext or ClearType, I can't remember what its called or how to reach the setting in control panel.

Also, now is as good a time as any to ask why the look of disapproval ( #3232;\_ #3232;) appears as 2 boxes for me (see screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/K3ddQ.png)

Any help for either of these issues would be appreciated! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The trouble is, without personally knowing you, its extremely difficult to give advice/extend a helping hand without it sounding super generic. I can't tell you that your life is worth living, or point out the good things in your world or tell you who to talk to. Possibly a close friend or family member could provide that sort of assistance to you, but certainly not a stranger over the internet.

I can however tell you that you *deserve* to live. You deserve the right to a depression-free, happy life - and from one person to another, I sincerely hope you fucking make it mate, I really do. I'd say I'd understand, because I've been there, I've been on the edge, that teetering point of sanity and insanity - but I can't understand you. Everyone's battle is different. Not harder, not easier - different. Hardship is subjective and I don't think anyone should ever claim to know what anybody is going through.

I know its bullshit and its frustrating, especially if I, or anyone else, tell you that only you can do it, only you can move forward. The only thing other people can do is be there. They can just hang around and support you. They can stop you from moving backwards, but the forwards is all on your own. Hopefully you have people like that in your life, that are willing to be there for you in your time/s of need. I was lucky enough to have a huge support network. But I can proudly say I made the journey to where I am now entirely on my own.

You made it this far. Don't back down. You're worth it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay firstly I'm just going to type out the question word for word:

Alex, an accomplished runner, has just been dropped off at Bandicoot Camp in the bush. The roads back to her home on Dugong Lane run south for 6km to the top of Cassowary Hill and then east 8km to the turn off for Dugong Lane. After limbering up for a run home through the bush, she gets a call on her mobile that she needs to get home quickly and there is no transport available at the camp.

Alex decides to run through the bush directly to the road heading east from Cassowary Hill to Dugong lane on a bearing of 135^o T.

If she runs at V km/h on the road to Dugong lane and b% of V through the bush, evaluate whether this is the best heading to run on?

Investigate Alex's options if she runs along the southerly road to Cassowary Hill between 10% to 20% faster than she can run through bush.

You will be assigned a value of V and b from the tables below. Circle your assigned values.

My assigned values are: **V km/h = 20** and **b = 50, b = 61**

I've gotten as far as drawing up a [diagram](http://i.imgur.com/JqJLg.png) to represent the paths, with the diagonal line being the direction Alex is travelling in (through the bush). I'm having a total mind blank and can't get any further than that. :/ Any help would be appreciated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Been using these builds for a couple of days, everything is pretty much rock solid except for ocassional graphical glitches and lag (mostly in low memory situations with lots of apps open). 

The thread OP just syncs repos with teamhacksung and builds it every 24 hours. Official cm10 experimental builds seem to come once every couple of days so this should satisfy other crack flashers like me until they start churning out official nightlies. </TEXT>

In the meantime I suggest an AOKP-based rom, as they have more features atm. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tell me what its like to look in the mirror and hate everything that you see. Tell me how it feels to know that for every second of happiness you are going to have an hour of suffering. What does it feel like to look around yourself, see the people that care for you, but theyre so far away. You scream and yell and cry but they cant hear you. Theyre looking, looking for you. Where did you go? What happened to the happy little boy that lived life to the fullest? Why am I so tired, tired of this world and this life? Every snide remark and ignorant comment feels like a punch to the gut. Im being eaten alive by a disease whose first mission is to knock out your communications. You cant tell anyone about the dark cocoon youre wrapped in. Wave after wave it crashes down on you, youre drowning, gasping for air. In between the waves you might be lucky enough to see a bit of sunshine, but only for an instant before your sight is robbed from you once more. What is a life without true happiness? Where the best feeling is no feeling at all, and sleep is the only real escape? Can a person really be blamed for wanting to escape such a hopeless place? What is living if it is simply out of guilt for the pain you would cause loved ones? If only I had gotten help sooner.

<TITLE> Not suicidal at the moment, just need to get this out.  </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Not sure how to start these things. I'm 16 years old and I was diagnosed with depression about eight months ago, but the effects of depression and suicidal thinking I've been experiencing for much longer, I'd say about 2 and a half years. 

I've had suicide "attempts" but I view these only as testing the waters, seeing just how close I can get to death before I back out. The most recent one was the most frightening. When I do this stuff to myself an intense clarity comes over me. It is quite literally a calm before the storm: everything is crystal clear and in those moments I swear I knew the answers to the universe. I was ready to die that night, but again I backed out. Each time I get ever closer. 

Right now I'm the happiest I've been in a long time; just gotten out of hospital and I'm on new medication, making huge strides in therapy. Yet I cannot shake this feeling of utter dread. This feeling of knowledge - the simple plain fact that my time is limited and when I die, it will be by my own hand. I am my own worst enemy. It feels like trying to hold up the sky - I can fight as hard as I can but eventually, the time will come when I break and the sky crushes me. I am loved. I can see it, feel it and experience the joy that it brings. But it feels worthless. I am unable to dredge up any meaning from life. I know I should try harder in school, but I just don't - I don't see the point in it. I want to make it clear that I am very happy, content with my life how it is at the moment. But similarly to how a terminal cancer patient is enjoying their last days, I enjoy my last days with those that I love. I know that people will be hurt - my family, friends, girlfriend will be absolutely crushed. But I feel like its not up for me to decide - the darkness within me is too powerful. It is relentless and I am its prisoner.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> what is depression? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-03-24 13:51:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> depression is

turning your phone off because you think nobody will try to text or call you anyway

having to deactivate your facebook so you arent tempted to impulsively post depressing and attention seeking statuses

being paranoid to the point where you ruin your friendships with people before they have the chance to hurt you

walking into your room and collapsing onto the floor and into tears as soon as youre out of everyones sight

having to say what? all the time because you cant seem to focus on what anyone is saying

looking at your school books and being unable to read or write anything because you just cant seem to think at all

getting angry at people when they touch you

not being hungry or feeling sick when you try to eat

the feeling of a constant weight on your shoulders

always being tired, no matter how much sleep you get

staying up all night because you dont want the next day to come

lying to your friends, psychologist and parents, telling them that youre getting better because you dont want to stress or worry them anymore

feeling like youd be better off dead

seeing the worst in people at all times

being unable to take a compliment or accept anything nice towards you

testing people to see if they actually care about you

overthinking things to the point where a kind gesture can become a hateful insult

spilling your whole story to people again and again in the hopes that maybe someone will save you

not being able to take a joke

having to fake a smile all day

hurting the people that you care about the most

asking yourself why cant you just be happy? on a daily basis

being constantly judged by people who have no clue what youre going through </TEXT>

<TITLE> Canon 300D CF card woes... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-06-23 09:02:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey there /r/photography. I've got a bit of a problem with my camera.

I recently bought a second-hand Canon 300D (the first Digital Rebel) from eBay for $350. I've been using it for about a month now, no problems. The camera came with two CF cards; one 512mb and a 128mb.

When I first got the camera, I put the 512mb card into it and hadn't taken it out until last night (I don't have a CF card reader so I simply plug my camera into my laptop and transfer the images that way, so there is almost no reason for me to take the CF card out.) I was planning to take more pictures than usual today, as I was going out with a couple of friends and I tend to take quite a few shots when I do; so I decided to make sure the 128mb card worked, since I'd never tried it before.

This is where the problems started. I replaced the 512mb card with the 128mb card and turned the camera on. When I do this, it takes much longer to turn on then usual ("EOS" is displayed on the screen for about fifteen seconds, as opposed to the normal one or two before I can start taking pictures). The screen then starts flashing with an "Error 02". 

I googled around a bit, and apparently Error 02 has something to do with the card and not the camera, and it suggests to format the card and try again. I tried to format the card on the camera, but the error wouldn't let me access the menu to do so. I simply wrote off the card, deciding that I'd pick up a 1GB card from an electronics store as soon as I could to use instead.

No problems, the 512mb card had done me good so far. I'd just have to be scarce with my picture taking.

So then I go to swap the 512mb card back in. The camera turns on as normal but the CF reading LED (which usually flashes for about ~1 second before I can save pictures to the card) only flashes once, and then I get a message on the screen saying "Full CF". Which is weird because I know for a fact that it's not. So I went into the menu, and tried to format the card. Before I format the card, it gives me information on the space - "2.7mb used of 3.8mb" - which obviously can't be right because it's a 512mb card.

So I go ahead and press format and then I get an "Error 99" on the screen. A google search of the error brings up mostly results about cleaning the lens connection on something similar; which I know is not the problem because the shutter works just fine when there isn't a CF card in there.

So has anyone experienced this before or know of a place I can take the camera? I'm not sure where I'd go to get it fixed, given that it's quite old. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just bought this phone online, and I can't seem to find **any** custom ROMs for the Backflip - my Google-Fu must be weak tonight.

The reason I want a custom ROM is because - frankly, Motorola's custom UI **sucks**.

*"If you knew you didn't like MotoBlur, then why did you buy the Backflip in the first place?"* - It's currently the only Android phone available to me through the carrier I want   the price I am willing to pay. Besides, I know I can just install LauncherPro and be done with BlurHome, which is my prime concern anyway. </TEXT>
