<TEXT> Hey man and thanks for answer,  
Yeah I really enjoy the "filling" feeling, but I thought something with some kind of knot would be nice.   I know that plug is pretty small and I have no problem to go like 2 or more times deeper.   I was thinking about going for the Chance since I like the knot at the head of it, or shape of it (not sure how to call it), but lately I was considering something with big knot.  I would like to get something that would challenge me, but wouldnt be crazy overkill.  
About the firmness, I wasnt really thinking about it, but I think that Firm would be the go-to.  
Yeah Im ordering to Czech Republic so Im prepared to pay some extra, but I can deal with that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello guys Im 18 years old guy who found out about Bad Dragon recently and i must say i totaly love this ! I love the people around here and all the stuff that bad dragon produces, I m just student so my money balance is pretty bad but I decided to get myself something to play with.  
So here s the thing.   
I m not sure what to go with, I already have (not bad dragon) [this](http://www.lovehoney.co.uk/product.cfm?p=6406) home and I can get myself open pretty good i think.  (probably not enough for large Chance, but thats pretty hardcore :))  
So the thing is can you guys gimme some recommendations for what toy would be good for me ? If you wanna know something feel free to ask, I can also provide with photos if it will be of any help :) , or you might enjoy it :) .   
Thanks for reading such a long post and I m sorry if I made any English mistakes :)  </TEXT>

Shrapnel now damages tower and gets two more charges,  
it also goes trough backdoor protection and once the sniper is picked, whole mid lane is covered in shrapnel.   
Every1 who gets close to him start to hear gradually raising voice saying HOHO HAHA untill your game shuts itself.  
Also Headshot damage is getting nerfed !  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Man i feel for you , I just found out Im gonna get expeled out of year beacuse of not doing stuff i was assigned. I have no problem with my grades or anything, I m not being bullied I just cant get myself to do anything. Im just shutting myself in my room and spending most of my time sleeping and I cant find any reason to do anything. Sometimes I dont even get up to watch Tv and i just lay in bed the whole day. The worst part is when my dad found out and he told me that Im just fuckin my life, that i could have done it if i wasnt lazy. And i know he is right but I just cant...  
  
I wish you all the best, hopefully we can both manage somehow :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> * How the fuck do i get rid of that emptiness inside when i finish a new anime?  
  
Thats the hardest part, best way is probably filling hole with another series   
also: My first anime was Soul Eater, after i finished it i felt big hole, but then i got the manga and read it and i felt way better, yeah and watching AMV of series you just finished will also help (at least for me it does)  
  
* Is there a way to control the "just one more episode and i'll go to bed"?  
  
Cant answer you on that one, its 5am here and Im sitting here watching anime.  
  
* I've spent way to much time on anime lately, so now that i'm into anime, is there a way out?  
  
Why would you want to get out ? Its like trying to jump out of luxury train, why would you do it ?

<TEXT> * Meepo - Earthbind
* Tinker - Heet-seeking missiles
* Tinker has refreshable disable that can catch multiple people and Meepo can shoot 2 rockets 4 times and the best thing is - 
* Aghanim
5 Meepoes - 4 rocket each one, I once managed to pick that in Ability draft, its really funny (at least when you are playin it :)). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for so long and insightful answer.
So first about Akira - i watched and i liked it even trough it was kinda mindfuck.
FLCL - i ve seen like 3 ep and i was like WTF?! im planning to watch more but i cant force myself to
DTB - amazing one, just watchin it
Samurai Champloo is on the list same goes for Baccano.
I know i will have to watch Cowboy Bebop and Trigun at some point :) and for the Hunter x Hunter im gonna give it another shot - i watched few first episodes and it just didnt pull me in, but maybe i just wasnt far enough. Guess im gonna try the Black Lagoon then go for Samurai Champloo and as for manga i will give a Berserk a shot. </TEXT>
