<TEXT> Be careful with this. Maybe your school is different, but when I was in college the online info wasn't accurate.  I worked in the dining halls and even though cooks are supposed to follow recipes,  sometimes they'd alter them. Add a little extra oil, or if we were short on an ingredient we'd substitute it with something else. Or the website wouldn't get updated and calorie counts would be off. It's a nice guide, but in my experience not extremely accurate.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Had potato soup last night. Don't have an exact recipe.  Bus basically it had potatoes,  carrots,  broccoli,  little bit of cheese, little bit of half and half,  chicken broth, and some random seasonings.  I've started making creamy soups with part cream and part broth and it turns out tasty for less calories. :)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I tend to switch it up. But I recently came across this sourdough recipe. http://www.reformationacres.com/2010/12/whole-wheat-sourdough-sandwich-bread.html but I cut out the brown sugar because I wanted the sourdough flavor to be stronger.  1 ounce of the bread is about 70 calories I believe. 

I also recently made a banana cashew chocolate bread. I can't seem to find it right now. But basically take your favorite banana bread recipe and add a handful of chocolate chips to the mix. Then spoon half the batter into pan. Mix cashew butter with a bit of oil to thin it out, and pour over batter. Pour rest of batter into pan and use knife to swirl the butter throughout the batter. So yummy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a big time snacker. Especially where I'm currently working. Lately my work lunch/snack has been:

3 ounces baby carrots (35 calories)

2 ounces low sodium deli meat (60 calories)

1 ounce block cheese (120 calories)

1 serving of dried fruit (about 100 calories)

114g low fat cottage cheese (90 calories)

Piece of homemade bread (about 150 calories) - could bring crackers or granola bar or something else.



I think that adds up to about 550 calories.  Which is basically my breakfast/lunch.


If you're into actual put together lunch.  Cottage cheese mixed with tuna in a lettuce wrap is my go to and high in protein.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Heres what happens: Grapefruit contains furanocoumarins, which block an enzyme that normally breaks down certain medications in the body. When it is left unchecked, medication levels can grow toxic in the body.

Its not just grapefruits, either. Other citrus fruits such as Seville oranges (often used in marmalade), limes, and pomelos also contain the active ingredients (furanocoumarins), but have not been as widely studied."

I've been tracking everything on MFP and have been eating 1200-1300 calories a day. Took me 77 days to get to where I am now. And I'm hoping to continue to my next goal of 135 pounds.

<TEXT> We used ground beef prime rib burger, cooked it, added onion, and mixed in some canned enchilada sauce. And seasoned it with whatever my SO threw in there, he is the spice man. 

I mixed corn, black beans, and canned tomato  green chilis together and heated them up.  This was meant to be just a side dish, but I threw some on top of my meat as well, and mixed a little bit of shredded Mexican cheese on top. 

Calories came to 509. We aim to keep dinner between 500 and 600. Without the shell it would have been 444. And the meat we used wasn't lean, so probably could have shaved a bit more calories off if we picked a different meat. But I was still under calories for the day so I was happy with the meal :)

Breakfast is around 200 - 300 calories.

Lunch is about 400 calories

If I have any left over I'll eat a little dessert or have a snack between meals.

My first goal is to get to a healthy weight. Once I get below 150 I'll no longer be overweight.  So close! 


Then I want to continue to around 130, but that's not a set number.  If I feel and look good at a different number,  then that'll be my final goal weight.  </TEXT>

You could easily track those things for breakfast. Then bring or purchase salad mixing and healthy sandwich items for lunch. Try to limit eating out to just dinner. Or eat out for dinner, but only eat half. Save the other half for the following day lunch.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Being told I look fine and don't need to lose weight.  I started 15 pounds above normal weight and now am only 5 pounds away from not being classified as overweight. I hope to lose an additional 20 pounds after I reach normal weight. That'll put me in the middle of the range for my height. Friends tell me I'm being silly because I look fine. But I'm overweight,  they just don't see it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You've been together for 6 years and still haven't met his son and he hasn't met your parents? Leave. If he has any relationship with his son, and hasn't felt the need to introduce you after 6 years, he has no plans on long term commitment.  

I'm (24) dating a man who is 36 and has a 7 yr old daughter and ex wife. I see his daughter almost every week, and I've met the ex wife. I'm currently living with my boyfriend, so an introduction to the ex seemed reasonable seeing as how her daughter lives with me when she visits her dad. 

As soon as things started to get serious, I met his daughter.  In my opinion 6 years is a very long time without meeting his son or your parents.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My boyfriend likes to eat doesn't care about counting calories. We like to eat together though. We will start planning a meal based on what meat we want. I may only eat 4 Oz serving while he eats 6 oz. Then we always have a decent size serving of veggie. He'll throw some cheese or butter on his. And then we add it some sort of grain. Once again he may add extra sauce or cheese or just a bigger portion than me. 

Basically we eat the same thing just slight variations that are easy to do as you go along.  </TEXT>

But I always vary a bit different than the recipe. I switch up the nuts, seeds, and fruits a lot. But stick to the total amounts of fillings and I stick to the liquid amounts, otherwise it won't bind properly. The no bake recipe is a tad sweeter, but good. If you like coconut, the kind bar is really good, also not quite as sweet which can be good. I make mine in a 6x8 pan because that's what I have. And cut them into 8 rectangles. Wrap them individually and keep them in the fridge. My boyfriends daughter who is 7 and picky loves them both.

<TEXT> I made one with strong iced coffee. I cold brew and then if I drink it by its self dilute to taste. For the smoothie I used it undiluted,  with frozen bananas, Greek yogurt and chocolate protein powder. Bit higher calorie, but filling. I had borrowed the protein powder from a friend, next time I'll probably just put a little bit of cocoa powder in it or maybe some peanut butter.

I look up recipes online all the time,  and then I play around with ingredients on my own too. If I have a bunch of random leftover ingredients that might go well together,  I try it. 


http://simplegreensmoothies.com/
I've gotten some good ideas for recipes here.  


Edit: I've seen people on this sub use PB2 a lot, haven't tried it yet. But from what I understand it's lower calorie than peanut butter and could be used in smoothies as well. 

Smoothies can get high in calories pretty quickly,  but I don't eat breakfast. I figure I can have one up to 400 calories without messing up my meals and snacks for the rest of the day. And if I know I won't be able to eat I'll make a more filling higher calorie one. If it's supposed to be a slower day,  I'll make a lower cal one so I can eat a lunch as well. 

The sugar amount can also get high very fast. More greens and just a little fruit can help keep it down.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I work in the service industry as well.  It can definitely be hard to find time to eat,  let alone eat something healthy.  I've begun making green smoothies with Chia seeds the night before so I can grab it as I walk out the door. In my experience most places allow you to keep a beverage near. And it can be a lot easier to grab a quick sip than to eat a snack. 

I make mine with spinach, coconut water (one that doesn't have added sugar), banana,  pineapple,  and Chia seeds. Mine tend to be between 200-300 calories depending on what fruits I switch up. They are typically spinach heavy with just enough fruit to sweeten it a bit.  And the Chia seeds help make it more filling. 

I also have been packing sliced vegetables and homemade granola bars or half a sandwich.  If I have a few minutes for a snack,  I eat the veggies. If I'm lucky enough to get a little lunch break, I eat the sandwich.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lot of cereals are fortified with iron. I believe rice Krispy has 50% of daily recommendation.  Fortified iron doesn't always get absorbed the best, but if you eat Vitamin C with it, it increases absorbtion. So for breakfast you could eat cereal and OJ. 

My boyfriend's daughter is 7 and picky and doesn't eat meat, and doesn't eat enough non meat sources with iron. She recently went to the doctor and was told her iron was very low.  I looked up recipes to make granola bars high in iron. That's an option, but also a bit high in calories.  </TEXT>

We are in slightly different parts of our lives, but I'm not far behind.  He has his career,  I'm just getting into mine. We both have bachelor degrees. 

 Biggest difference I'd say is he is divorced and has a daughter,  but I know several people my age that have kids and are single/divorced. 

For us, the age gap isn't a deal breaker.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> How does this shit work? Are regular Starbucks employees expected to perform cream art in peoples drinks? Is this difficult? I don't get it. Seems like a huge pain in the ass, day in-day out. Even if this is an indie place or something, do you charge more because goons expect you to draw shit in their coffee drinks?

I worked at an independent coffee shop for a while and started teaching myself how to do latte art. It isn't difficult, just takes time and practice. We weren't required to do it, but did it because it was fun, competitive with other baristas, and made the work day more interesting. Most customers don't expect it, but it's great to see the smile and surprise on their face when you hand their coffee to them. No extra charge.  It doesn't really take any extra time. You need to pour the milk into the espresso anyway, why not do it in a fun way. :) </TEXT>

Some culinary schools are a waste and some are actually really good. It's amazing networking, it gets you in a kitchen cooking faster than working up from a dishwasher to a chef, and you can be introduced to so many more techniques and varieties of foods than working in a restaurant because you aren't limited to just the theme of the food at the restaurant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've seen a range of prices. At this same shop they had a gold razor that looked like a double edge, but only had one edge to it and had little comb things sticking out - it was about $20. They also had some travel ones with a case and other little things in it, but were upwards of $30 so I passed on those. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bought this razor on a whim without knowing what type it was, after searching online I've found that it is a gillette slim made in 1966. I did a quick clean up just to make sure it twisted and turned in all the ways it should, and everything looks good.

Currently I use a schick krona (which I really like), but I've noticed that the gillette slim is a bit heavier and has a shorter handle. My little sister has shown interest in DE and I want to give her a starter kit for Christmas. Would the shorter handle and the heavier razor be okay for a female beginner? Or should I keep looking for something with a longer handle and lighter weight? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Only reason I was looking for stainless steel instead of aluminum is because you can't cook acidic things in it. 

For the actually canning process, there is no difference in what container you use then? As long as it covers the jars and you can heat it on the stove?

I'm in the process of getting a book :) I'm currently living somewhere with extremely limited resources, so I've been relying on friends, family, and internet advice. 

I've been told to start with something easy the first time I can, does it really matter seeing as how I'll still have to go through the same canning steps? My plan is to make apple butter this week and can that as my first item.

Thanks again for all your help! </TEXT>

I have a flat stove top so I want to avoid the granite ones. I started looking at stainless steel stockpots and found this one [(http://www.amazon.com/Alpha-Heavy-Stainless-Steel-Savezoneusa/dp/B002GE5GYI/ref=cm_cr_dp_asin_lnk)]. I've heard good things about it, but is it really necessary to spend 60 dollars on a pot. Does anyone have any other suggestions of good ones that maybe are a bit cheaper? Thank you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Applying for everything isn't wrong. I'm completely white, and applied for a scholarship my senior year of high school that was supposed to be given to an African American female that played sports and had a good gpa. I was a perfect candidate for the scholarship, except for the whole being white issue. My principal, who was black, told me to apply anyway because the foundation rather give money to someone than no one and hardly anyone applied for this scholarship. I ended up being one of the people who received the scholarship. I was honest on my scholarship application and checked the box saying I was white. I know this doesn't explain why it isn't racist, but several other people in this thread did a good job of that already. Just wanted to encourage you to apply to any and all scholarships, it isn't wrong and you might get lucky. :) </TEXT>

I have not used pre shave oil. 
 
I'm not use to having to pull my skin so it is stretched, so I'm probably not doing it 100% the way it should be.

Update: using the lower faucet helped with the lather. Ended up knicking my underarm - trying to hold the razor, pull the skin, and shave with basically one hand is harder than anticipated.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> You have too much good beer in VT to not keep trying. Here's a pointer to enjoying beer, I've found that when I pour the beer into a mug, it tastes better than in the bottle. Pour the beer just right so you get a bit of a head on top. Also, there is a wide variety of beers. If you don't like the taste of an IPA, you may enjoy a Porter more. Where I'm from, there are some stores that sell create-your-own six packs. I recommend finding one of those, and purchasing six completely different styles of beer. Try each one (not all the same night) so that you can see which ones you prefer. Keep note of what you do or don't like, and then you can ask for beers with similar tastes. </TEXT>

Thank you everyone for all of your jokes, they have brightened up my night. I was unable to just pick one, so I've selected ClassyAssBitch and johannvaust. I've messaged them and waiting to hear back.

<TEXT> I live about a mile from campus and walk, unless the weather is really bad or I'll be on campus way past dark. I hate when circumstances arise where I feel like I need to drive. I end up having to leave earlier because otherwise I won't find a spot, or students walking will cause me to sit at a stop sign for a solid 5 minutes. On top of that, there is the problem of feeding the meter every two hours so I don't get a ticket. Driving to campus really is more of a hassle than walking.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm paying my own way through college. I'm a full time student and I work 35-40 hours a week. If I had the option to have my parents pay for my school, I'd accept in a heartbeat.

For the most part I'm indifferent to people who have parents that pay for their college. I've met a lot of different people in school, some that have their school paid for through loans, through scholarships, by working, or from their parents. How someone pays for school doesn't define them though. A good friend, coworkers, etc. wouldn't change how they think of you because of this.

The only time I've had any issues with someone who has parents paying for their school, is when they act spoiled about it.

As long as you don't walk around bragging about it, it's nothing to be ashamed of. 

TL;DR
I think they are pretty damn lucky.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sometimes people cave. It's a personal choice. My family made prime rib for dinner last night. My older brother made it (an amazing cook) and it took so much will power not to eat any. Every side dish was vegetarian though, so that helped. 

I've caved, I know I'm new to this whole thing, and I accept I'll slip up sometimes. My reasons for being pescatarian aren't moral reasons, so if I slip and eat meat I just start over and try again. 

Tell your fiance you love him, but were really hungry and what you eat is your decision. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've taken my own food with me places. All summer I kept vegetarian canned soup/pasta and microwaveable vegetarian items in my car because I never knew where I'd be when I was hungry and didn't want to burden the person I was dating with having to feed me. When I go to bbqs I always bring my own veggie burgers. I never expect someone to make accomidations for me, but appreciate it when they do. However I didn't grow up vegetarian and made this change after I had moved out on my own. When people order pizza, they generally get half a pizza with what I want on it. I'd suggest talking to your fiance's family and asking about being more vegetarian friendly. Maybe they don't understand it or don't know what to make. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been a fish eating vegetarian (pescatarian) for about 10 months now and the hardest part is family gatherings especially around holidays. Today is my family's Christmas get together and for Christmas we do a lot of finger foods: meatballs, ham rollups, veggies, etc. One of my favorite foods are my mom's ham rollups. I could easily eat a whole platter. I have never asked my family to change their recipes or make special accomodations for me - it's never been an issue finding something to munch on. Well today as we are setting the table, I notice something different, my mom made vegetarian ham rollups. Instead of wrapping the pickle and cream cheese spread in ham, she wrapped them in a spinach leaf. They tasted so good, even some of my meat eating family were snacking on them, I actually had to make sure I got some because the regular ham rollups were being ignored. 

This small gesture meant a lot to me, and I just wanted to share with you how awesome my mom is.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mine generally have to be in omelet form. Scrambled is a weird texture, and if the yolk and whites are separate, I can't stand the taste. Mushroom, tomato, onion, pepper, and cheese omelet is my favorite. 

As a kid and even a teen, I hated beans, but since becoming vegetarian I have tried them again and opened up to them. 

Ice cream is obviously delicious, but milk has always been my beverage of choice. 

I looked for my main nutrition book to see if I could find any more information, but it's back at my parents' place. When I go home for thanksgiving I'll see if it has anything else to say about it and if it has anything about nutrition and depression. 

Where are you looking to attend and what do you want to major in? Anything science tends to do that until enough information, research, and studies are available to come to a definite conclusion. In all of my classes I have been taught omega 3 is beneficial. 

Me too, I just searched my schools courses to see if any went over nutrition and depression/anxiety, but I wasn't able to find anything.

I've started searching online for local psychiatrists/therapists, and it is slightly overwhelming.  

Respecting my likes and dislikes is something I need to work on. I don't mind going to the bar and being social, but I'm kind of past the drunken college party scene. 

I know you said changing your diet helped, but are you also currently taking any medication or seeking counseling? (I apologize if you've already covered this, I'm on my phone and I'm not sure how to see previous posts while typing a reply. :/) </TEXT>

The best sources for protein are definitely from meat, dairy products are also good and grains have some protein, but not much. I get most of my protein from dairy products and beans. I absolutely love milk and skim actually has more protein than whole milk.

If you're interested in studying nutrition, go for it. There is a lot of information out there and you could easily purchase books and learn a lot on your own. Just make sure they are credible. Nutrition is just my minor, but in my spare time I try to learn as much as I can.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've thought about seeing someone, but I'm really bad at communicating how I feel and opening up to a stranger. Was it hard at first for you to open up? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Used this recipe http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/vanilla-bean-creme-brulee-recipe/index.html and used an entire vanilla bean instead of only half. Struggled with the blowtorch part a bit though, in the pic you can see some of the sugar wasn't completely caramelized, but on other ones I ended up burning it. Any suggestions? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Call at age 5 to explain that there was nothing I could do to stop my grandpa and uncle from committing suicide, and to not waste the next 17 years trying to please everyone and feeling like a failure when I'm not successful. Because 1. It is impossible to please everyone, 2. Pleasing everyone won't bring my grandpa and uncle back, and 3. Even if people seem happy on the outside, it doesn't mean everything is okay on the inside. </TEXT>
