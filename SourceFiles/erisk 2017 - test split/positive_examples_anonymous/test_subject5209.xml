<TITLE> Is it out of line to want to know where your SO is going when they leave the house? </TITLE>

<TEXT> To keep it short, my wife (35F) and I (33M) just got done with a talk about where our failing marriage is headed and if it's something that we want to fight for (I know I want us to work out, but her answer to every question I ask is, "I don't know").

She just left the house without telling me where she was going. I texted her and she replied, "Wow! Last time I checked I was a grown adult!". Is it wrong of me to want to know...just in case something happens to her? I still care and worry about her.

**tl;dr** I'd like to know where she's going at 11:30 at night. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was still living at home at the age of 26 when I met my future wife (6 years now).

Parents said I could stay as long as I wanted to after high school and college, rent free. Ended up saving up a LOT of money doing that. I was able to pay off multiple cars over the years, built my credit up to a great number, and had a hefty savings for doing special things with my girl (including buying her the rings and wedding that she always wanted).

No ragrets. </TEXT>

I ended up with a 2 inch splinter of wood being jammed up my middle fingernail...all the way. I had to go to the nearest urgent care facility to get shots in my finger and get it pulled out with tiny tweezers.

If I had any secrets that someone wanted to know at that time, I would have yelled them at the top of my lungs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The scene in The Patriot when Mel Gibson's character is about to ride off to fight in a battle and he asks his daughter (who is traumatized from earlier events and hasn't spoken since) to give him just one word before he goes. She refuses, he goes to hug her, and she pulls away. As he's riding away, she stares him down and then says "Papa!". He jumps off his horse and runs to her. She says "I'll say anything, just please don't go" and hugs him.

<TEXT> I work in the same environment and have had the same exact issue.

Sales manager at our sister plant in a different city calls IT. Says she has a new hire sitting in a cubicle, ready to work. No form was submitted to our department, letting us know anything about the new hire.

She asks what we can do for the new employee that day. I told her that we can give him some magazines to read until his thin client is set up, which normally doesn't take too long since we happen to have some in stock. Unfortunately, since she waited to tell us about the new guy...the new guy is going to wait until  *we*  get ready for him to work.

It may seem like we in the IT department are assholes, but everyone else is a bunch of bastards! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going through a lot of shit right now (that I don't feel like divulging at the moment). I got a text from a friend asking if I wanted to join him for some drinks at a bar tonight. I said sure and a couple of hours in, we were having serious conversations about our lives.

I came really close to telling him about how the scar on my arm was from when I felt my life was in a tailspin and the pain from cutting was the only thing that I could actually control. As soon as I got ready to say it, I chickened out. I just couldn't imagine what one of my closest friends would think about me.

I don't cut anymore, but every time I sweat while playing basketball or working out...it becomes very visible. I guess that will be with me for the rest of my life.

There's no real point to this post. I just needed to get that out. </TEXT>

The sheep do not want the dog around. He looks too much like the wolf. He reminds them that danger lurks out there just beyond the relative safety of the fence.
  
The wolf also hates the dog. He knows that it is the dog that stands between him and his prey. It is because of the dog that he is lean. The dog is the reason the wolf is forced to stalk the darkness.
  
The dog knows these facts. Undeterred, he stands watch, ever ready to do battle. Despite that he is a welcome guest in their midst, the dog is ready at a moments notice, to give his life in defense of his flock. It is simply who he is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me...cold weather school delays.  As a kid, that was the best news I could get in the morning while watching Bobby's World and eating strawberry poptarts.  Now as an adult, I have to make last minute plans to get my daughter to school and possibly be late to work if I have to end up taking her myself.  I can understand delays for snow and ice (I'm from SC), but today my daughter has a 2 hour delay...with dry roads, no snow, no sleet, and no ice anywhere. 

So why the delay?!  Are schools training our children to be a bunch of testicles that can't take the cold?  I'm just waiting for the day when she has a delay because the sun is too hot.

Maybe I feel like they're cutting her education short (over multiple "non-necessary" weather delays)...maybe I'm just bitter.  I don't have a delay for my job.  Meh. </TEXT>

<TEXT> IMO, it depends on the degree of the accident.
  
Leaving vehicles involved in a traffic accident in the middle of the road (that could easily be moved to the side of the road) can cause traffic congestion and possibly another wreck down the line.  
  
If it's at all possible (car is capable of being moved, no one involved in the wreck is seriously injured, etc.)...it's a wise move to clear the road.

<TEXT> I know it's stupid, but [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Licked_Hand) has changed the way I live my life (albeit in a very small way).
      

At night, my cat always props up on the side of the bed to bump his head against/lick my hand before jumping on the bed.  Ever since I became aware of this stupid legend, I have to turn on my phone's flashlight and shine it in his face before I am at ease.

First one was 70 in a 45 on a highway. Got a ticket for that. In the same stop, I got a written warning about my expired tag and a verbal warning about my tinted windows. Gave him a "Thank you sir." and I was on my way home.

Second one was 83 in a 60 on the interstate. Got a verbal warning for that. Here's the kick...I also got a ticket for my expired tag and one for my tinted windows. I was contemplating on saying "Thank you sir, may I have another?", but I realized that would not end well for me.

Needless to say, my driving habits will be changing...along with my insurance premiums. </TEXT>

Another was a single player tip to invest in the companies that Lester talks about before doing the assassinations...which I haven't done any of them yet.

And another was:
1. Make two character profiles.
2. Have one be like an "off shore" bank account.
3. Whatever money you earn with your main character, put into the bank.
4. Switch to the other character and have him withdraw it all into pocket cash.
5. Switch back to the main character, and if someone kills you, the "medical bill" doesn't get taken out of your bank account. </TEXT>

<TEXT> On Xbox, I believe it's:

Back button  Inventory  Give Cash

I could be wrong, though.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> After a survival mission, I got placed into a random session. With only me and another person in this session, I felt somewhat safe to go about my business (robbing stores, shooting random NPCs, taking pictures of bikini clad women on the beach).

Out of the blue, this guy sends me a text saying that we should team up. Being the paranoid person that this game has turned me into...I accept, but have my pistol out just in case. He rumbles up to my location in a fully modded Z Type. Seeing as I barely have $9K in the bank and haven't seen that car in game anywhere before...I was impressed.

He then proceeds to friend me, let me in his car, and then takes me to his $400K apartment. I felt like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman...only, you know...if Julia Roberts was a dude. Anyway, we get to his apartment and go into the garage, where he proceeds to show me his impressive array of whips, all modded out as well. We then spend the next 10-20 minutes, standing there just talking money strategies and general gameplay tactics. He told me a bunch of things that I didn't know and even offered to give me cash, but couldn't because the option was grayed out at the time being.

At the end of our rendezvous, he says he's going to go play CoD and to hit him up later for some general GTA fun. Right before he leaves he says, "Most people with a bounty on their head wouldn't be as trusting as you were.". At that point, I just remembered that I jacked an NPCs ride before the previous survival mission and he put a $5K bounty on my head. I had totally forgotten about it.

That was the absolute coolest experience that I've had with a random person in GTA:O! This game is awesome! </TEXT>
