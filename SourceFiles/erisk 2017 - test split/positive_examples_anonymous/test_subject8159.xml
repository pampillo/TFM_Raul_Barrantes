I didn't want to tear my work out, so I ended up single crocheting down the side that had the dropped stitch(es) and back. It looked like a repair, but I was glad to have a fix that didn't require undoing 8 hours of work.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am on the opposite side of the issue. In fact, one of the worst things about depression for me is that I don't know how to ask my boyfriend or close friends to help. Last night, I called the suicide hotline. I am not suicidal, but I wanted to talk to someone about this extra burden I feel. I don't think I got any straight-forward answers, because I got the feeling that they are just there to listen and guide your thoughts while giving you a chance to talk. However, I don't think I was looking for straight-forward answers. I just needed someone to talk to that I didn't have a committed friendship or with. 

TLDR: Call the suicide hotline for depression counseling. They are also there to help people whose loved ones have depression.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know what your situation is, but I will offer advice with mine. I am in school, and have been seeing my doctor for 9 months. I know I can call and leave a message in the office for a renewal, but if I wanted a higher dosage, I feel like she should be willing to either prescribe it to me (upon hearing the patterns I experience) or recommend me to a doctor in my new area. 

If you call and ask, the worst thing that can happen is they say no. Which is hard when you have depression, but are also able to ask questions beyond those that warrant yes/no answers. 

Good luck. You owe this to yourself!!  </TEXT>
