<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A little while ago i purchased 2 skeins of Loops  Threads T-shirt yarn in some natural colors and I have no idea what I want to make with it! It is bulky yarn, I was thinking a simple hat but wanted to know if anyone had any ideas if they've used this yarn before or have seen some great ideas. All i can find is loosely knit cowls and hats and dont like the very loose look. Ravelry only has a few projects, and most of them are crochet. Any and all ideas are welcome! Thanks :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for the reply! I apologize for the wall of text, i see its way too long and not going to attract anyone, but you did give me some very useful information about gussets. Thank you. Just one question - it wont look disproportional if theres say 70 stitches on the body of the glove and 60 (at least) after the gusset? It seems strange to me but i guess I'll go with the flow and how im interpreting this pattern. Thanks, and I'll remember to try to keep to a more simplistic style of explanation next time. :) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Help!! I'm new to gussets and trying to decipher a pattern for the fingerless mittens I'm currently knitting </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-03-05 23:19:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I need some fellow knitters' awesome advice and help please - I started knitting the Sweet Life mittens I found on Ravelry a little while ago. Having never done a gusset in my life before (I've only been knitting scarves and hats), I'm having trouble trying to decode this pattern. Here is the original pattern for the left hand gusset that the author wrote (keep in mind the patterned part is only on the top, there is ribbing underneath, and I'm knitting in the round):

Left Mitt Gusset
Knit in pattern to last 2 K sts, move marker to this spot. Increase two sts between the final 2 sts
by picking up the stitch below and knitting into the front and back of that stitch. Knit in pattern for two rounds. At the third round continue pattern, Slip marker. Kfb the next stitch, knit across gusset and kfb the last stitch in the round. You will continue in this manner, increasing 2 sts every third round, until you have 12sts in your gusset. Knit one round in pattern. At the end of the round remove the gusset sts to waste yarn. In the space left by the gusset sts, CO 6 sts. Knit 2 rounds in pattern. On the third round K2tog after Marker and again for the last two sts in round. Continue in this manner decreasing 2 stitches every third row until you are back to the original (36, 48) stitch count. Knit in pattern until 7.5 inches long.

So I have attempted to write this in an easier form for myself, row by row. Here is the majority of my attempt:

left gusset pattern written out:
1: repeat #2, last two knit stitches in pattern, move marker HERE. increase between next two stitches 2 stitches by m1 and kfb that stitch
2: repeat #3
3: repeat #4, after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round
4: repeat #5
5: repeat #6
6: repeat #7, after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round
7: repeat #8
8: repeat #9
9: repeat #10, after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round
10: repeat #11
11: repeat #12
12: repeat #1 after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round
13: repeat #2 
14: repeat #3
15: repeat #4 after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round
16: repeat #5
17: repeat #6
18: repeat #7 after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round
19: repeat #8 
20: repeat #9
21: repeat #10 after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round
22: repeat #11
24: repeat #12
25: repeat #1 after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round
26: repeat #2
27: repeat #3
28: repeat #4 after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round
29: repeat #5
30: repeat #6
31: repeat #7 after marker slip kfb next stitch, knit across gusset, kfb last stitch in round
32: repeat #8, slip gusset sts on waste yarn and cast on 6 sts in empty space
33: repeat #9
34: repeat #10
35: repeat #11, after marker slip, k2tog, k2tog last 2 stitches in round
36: repeat #12
37: repeat #1
38: repeat #2, after marker slip, k2tog, k2tog last 2 stitches in round
39: repeat #3
40: repeat #4
41: repeat #5, after marker slip, k2tog, k2tog last 2 stitches in round
42: repeat #6
43: repeat #7
44: repeat #8, after marker slip, k2tog, k2tog last 2 stitches in round
45: repeat #9
46: repeat #10
47: repeat #11, after marker slip, k2tog, k2tog last 2 stitches in round
48: repeat #12
49: repeat #1
50: repeat #2, after marker slip, k2tog, k2tog last 2 stitches in round

I have no idea if I'm doing this right. If any of you more experienced knitters could help me out on this, I would greatly appreciate your expertise! Also if you spot anything else in my "redone" pattern that looks a little wrong, feel free to let me know. It just seems like the whole gusset and actual body of the mitten would be so unproportional (lol is that a word even?)

Here is a link to the Sweet Life pattern: http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/sweet-life
A link to my project page (has my improvised pattern in the notes): http://www.ravelry.com/projects/test_subject380597/sweet-life

Thank you thank you thank you!!!
