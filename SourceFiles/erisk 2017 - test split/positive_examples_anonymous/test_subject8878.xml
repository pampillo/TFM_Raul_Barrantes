<TITLE> 18/F/UK looking for penpals whom speak a different language to myself </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-12-11 04:44:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello! I'm a native english speaker and I'm looking for penpals who are willing to to correspond with me (either through email or snail mail) in a different language.

If you already know English, or have no interest in bettering your english language skills, you can write to me in your language and I'll respond in the same. However If you are interested in bettering your language skills, you can write to me in English and I'll respond back in your language. We can both exchange comments on sentence structure and give constructive criticism too.

I am looking to learn a variety of languages (though less of the grammar and tenses and more just being able to effectively communicate), however learning chinese and arabic do not agree with me. I have tried and It just didn't happen :/

Edit: Just to clarify - I speak NO other languages beside english and poor conversational french (which I wouldn't mind improving too). So this is going to be hard...

So comment or PM if want to be penpals :)

edit: Family stuff has made me really busy so I can't write to anyone anymore. Thanks to those who agreed to help me with this project.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure if it changes where you are from but as long as you have a medical note from your doctor and you have been experiencing problems with it then you should 'qualify'. They can't reject you because people need to realise this is a real condition and it has real affects to daily life. Whether you are in uni or have a job or both - depression can make it a lot harder to keep up and get by. </TEXT>

Preferably not including museums, monuments or anything like that. Also does anyone know if there are any cool themed restaurants or cafes or anything? Thank you!

Edit: Thanks to everyone who has recommended a place to go. I will definitely be trying to get to all of these the next time I'm out exploring Edinburgh City.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is a girl who is an orphan and lives with maids of a house (its set in either the 19th or 20th century). She either finds an amulet or is in possession of an amulet. Either way, word gets around and a woman comes knocking claiming to be her mother, who takes her away to live with her. I think part of the book is set in Venice. In the end, the girl realizes that the woman was not her mother but forgives her anyway. Does anyone know this book? </TEXT>

EDIT: Thanks everyone! I had my appt. and it went really well. She was straightforward, actually listened to me and then gave me a perscription and told me to use my free uni councelling service. It really helped that I braught with me the PHQ. I now have a perscription for fluoxetine. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My flatmates watch t.v in the hall of our flat til late, talk loudly and keep me up - what is a nice way i can deal with this and not make it awkward since I have to live with them til June? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-11-06 01:46:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Recently my flatmates have taken to watching tv on their laptop in the hall of our flat. There are three of them and it only started happening recently. They put on youtube clips of movies, songs (and sing a long with them) and talk really loudly. Sometimes they scream and one tends to shriek a lot. Sometimes I can hear them running up and down the flat chasing eachother like children. FYI - no drinking involved.
Usually I put up with it but when I have a 9am lecture (and I know that none of them are in until around 12pm) I can tell its gonna be a long night. I shouldn't have to put up with this though right?
Also I have depression to getting sleep is really important. I have said to them nicely that I was trying to sleep (that was last night) and they quietened down but I'm afraid that they will be more bitchy to me if I come out and say it on a regular basis. 
BUT ITS FUCKING ANNOYING!
So what do I do? This is uni accomodation so I have to stay til June and can't change flats (another flatmate of ours applied ages ago because of them and was told there is none) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do. I feel guilty because I have had nothing in my life was truly traumatic (though my bio dad did stop contact with me when I was 9) or horrifying in my life to make me feel this way. I also have nothing to be sad for. I am university, have enough money and then some to get by and live a 'decent' life. So why do I feel like I hate my life  that I'd be better off dead? It makes no sense to me but it is what it is. </TEXT>
