<TITLE> Some info I did the math for... Family problems? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-14 04:12:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, me and a friend did some math to determine the age of "Shermy". 

The baby seen during the Stan twins' senior year is anywhere from 0-2. Both of the Pines are likely 18. 

Now, Dipper and Mabel are 12. This means, since the show is set in 2012, they were born in 2000. This allows us to pin some time quick:

-The author hasn't been himself for 30 years, meaning Ford was lost in the portal in 1982. 
-Stanley said they hadn't seen each other in ten years before entering the shack, meaning that they were seniors in 1972, and they were then both 28. 
-Little sidestep, this means that Ford and Lee are currently 58, and were born in 1954. 
-The baby, who we're assuming is Shermy, is 10-12 by the time Ford gets in the portal (1982). 
-By 2000,  "Shermy" is 28-30. Not grandpa age. 

So either Shermy's got hella mojo, that's not their grandpa, or "Grunkle" is an affectionate term, making them actually just uncles. 

Appreciate any input! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Doctor Doom and Darth Vader are competing to kill five Disney princesses. Who would win? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-10 22:43:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Both Doom (616) and Vader (Between V-VI) are interested in expanding their empire, and unknowingly, both have targeted the same five kingdoms:

1. Snow White's Cottage
2. Sleeping Beauty's Castle
3. Cinderella's Castle
4. Elsa's Ice Castle
5. Ariel's Undersea Kingdom

Each has access to their generic army of Doombots and Stormtroopers, respectively, and their usual powers / weapons. In order for one to win, they must kill the other, and all five princesses must be dead. Their army cannot kill any of the targets, solely Doom and Vader can. They travel by air (Doom has a jet, Vader a TIE Fighter), but cannot kill anyone using the vehicle's weapons. No access to any planet-destroying weapons, solely what they keep on them for personal combat. 

Each Disney princess has their supporting cast with them:

Snow White: The Seven Dwarves, her Prince, woodland creatures

Sleeping Beauty: Fairies, Prince Phillip, woodland creatures

Cinderella: 
Prince Charming, animal servants, could summon Fairy Godmother when crying

Elsa: Anna, Olaf, the reindeer guy, his reindeer, the snow monster

Ariel: Sebastian, Flounder


Will either be able to conquer each kingdom and destroy their competition? </TEXT>

<TITLE> So, thoughts on adding more amiibo support in the future? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-01 18:13:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is something I personally really want to see in the game. 

While I have the Splatoon amiibos, it feels like there's a lot left to desire with them. Compared to other games with exclusive amiibo, Splatoon's addition feels more like hidden challenges than extra support. Something I'd like to see is *amiibo costumes*.

Like Mario Kart 8 / Kirby  the Rainbow Curse / Yoshi's Wooly World, I'd like to see certain amiibo unlock new gear for your character to wear, with special effects. Ideally, there'd be 2-3 pieces of gear locked to an amiibo, and perhaps some kind of re-skin on a weapon, sharing stats with another weapon. Say, perhaps, you have a Samus amiibo. Scanning it in gives you her Helmet (with the Bomb Sniffer ability), the Varia Suit (Defense Up), the Varia Boots (Ink Resistance) and a Arm Cannon designed Charger (with Burst Bombs and a Bubbler). 

There's several characters that could really be interesting additions (Mario costume w/F.L.U.D.D. please), and allow for a larger variety of opponents, and more incentive on purchasing amiibos.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been dealing with this crap for a while now, and I've been fairly silent about it until now. 

Flashback to 8th grade, May 2013. I had everything going for me. I was in high classes for the majority of my courses, just got accepted into the National Junior Honor Society, plenty of friends, a plan for the future, and a loving family. I had some procrastination issues, but otherwise I was an A/B student. Then I got the news that my grandma was sent to the hospital, and the outcome was, most likely, death. I took it badly, shaking and crying. My grandma and grandpa were like a second home for me, I went there after school and did work there, played with their dogs, and had a lot of good memories over there. The idea of not seeing her anymore was devastating, and I was using it to push myself further to make her proud. I finished the year with a high GPA, got into high classes for my freshman year and continued to do things I loved. A slight addiction to Nintendo and the (then-upcoming) Smash Bros. for Wii U helped push through and give me something to look forward to. 

As the time went by, my grandma went from near-death to surviving. A few amputations on her leg later, she bounced from nursing home to nursing home. Grandpa, meanwhile, stayed at their house with the dogs, taking care of it and such, a lot more carefree and "fun" than usual. We'd visit him often, mostly over the weekends, and we'd also go to the nursing home every other night or so to see my grandma. While she remained the person I loved, I saw a more bitter side to her. She was constantly whining about how she's trapped here, and I always felt guilty, for no real reason. I'd led to her getting injuries when I was little, but it wasn't what she was struggling with then.

Time went by, little by little, soon freshman year was almost over. I had finished with decent grades, as was expected, and had made a lot of new friends, alongside signing up for AP European History and such. Then came the phone call that changed my life. I was sitting at home, sick from school, both parents at work and my little brother at school. I got a call from my grandma, still in her nursing home, about two weeks from her release back home to resume normal life. She was in tears, asking for my mom. When I  told her they were at work, she began to cry harder. I had no idea what was happening, and had to ask what had happened. Apparently, my grandpa had just called her. He was divorcing her. Before I could call my mom, grandpa called. He ranted about how he was doing "the right thing" and that everything was going to be better now. 

What a fucking liar. 

After having to call both mom and dad to explain what was happening, I couldn't do anything but sit there and cry. I was freaking out, I didn't know what to do. Once they got home and settled me down, my mom made the decision to help my grandma move into her house, and stay with her for a few weeks to help get her back into where she used to be. My sole mission was to keep my little brother out of the action, and ensure he wasn't affected by any of the bullcrap that was happening. Yet, there was a huge part of me that was trying to fix things. The family was falling apart, and people were constantly yelling and freaking out. I was left in the middle, trying to solve things that I now know was impossible. 

As time passed, my brother and I (and our dog) moved in with mom and grandma, as weeks became about 2 months. We'd stay there for a while until grandma was capable of living on her own. Nurse visits, trips to the hospital, screaming phone arguments, everything was just guilting me even more. I became more involved online through Smashboards (a Smash Bros. forum), made friends there, got really high in the ranks and became part of a group of "the best of the best". People really liked me there, it was an escape from the life I was beginning to fear. Fanfictions, video games, developing video games, speculating them, I was engulfed in this world and slowly leaving my own. 

Truths began to unravel. My grandpa had been cheating on my grandma since my mom got pregnant with me. Trips to the gym, attempts to "become healthier" were all a ruse to impress this other woman. We found porn, condoms, lube, the whole nine yards in the house.  Soon, we went from a 2-week stay to the entire summer, with our bus routes picking us up at my grandma's place. 

I started our sophomore year pretty well, with the exception of AP Euro, which I couldn't focus in. Managed a 3.0 GPA by end of first semester. Home life, on the other hand, was terrible. Constant fights, dealing with grandpa's shit, the constant barking of her dogs, who went from being adorable playmates to terrorizing little shits, etc. At one point, my grandpa tried to take us to court and get custody over me and my brother, as my parents were "incapable and horrible at raising us". It sucked. 

Now, sophomore year is nearly over. I am failing nearly all of my classes. I've been diagnosed with clinical depression, and I'm taking 20mg of anti-depressants each night. I can't concentrate, and my addiction to Smash Bros. and it's world has become destructive. I've stopped caring about things, my future, my friends, nothing but trying to escape the real world. Each night, I'm doing plenty of chores, taking care of all three dogs, taking care of dinner occasionally, sometimes trying to do schoolwork and spending the rest of the time on Imgur, Skype and Reddit, browsing for no true reason. My mom is smoking a pack a day, and, when she's not working, is laying in bed feeling sick. My grandma is wheeling around, being demanding and yelling at us about stupid crap that doesn't matter. She attempted to stab my mother with a fork because my grandma took a burger from us and tried to feed it to the dogs, and when my mom tried to stop her, my grandma yelled that "she's trying to help the only ones that matter to her." My brother is remaining oblivious to most of it,  thankfully, but is glued to his Kindle and spends most of the time avoiding his work, making me do it. Dad's at work and only sees us occasionally, and that's driving him mad, and grandpa's with his significant other, doing what he pleases and being cheap on us. I've contemplated suicide once or twice, but I've never acted on it because I know it will only cause more pain to my family. 

I'm nearly at the point of giving up. I can't do anything anymore without causing someone trouble. None of my friends really try to help, and my family's attempts to help me have failed. I'm becoming violent, and beginning to obsess over stupid things like those little Nintendo amiibo figures. My life is a mess, and I have no way of escape anymore. Collecting and buying the figures gives me moments of false happiness, as does playing video games. My family is constantly fighting, and I can't do anything to fix it. 

I just can't do anything right, and I'm done with it. I don't know what to do with myself anymore.  </TEXT>

Plus, it gives him figures of his favorite characters, so that's always an extra point.

Wolf and Lucas, while they had a lot of similarities to Fox and Ness, still had major differences and lots of unique moves. Snake and Icies were just fun to play as.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, there's a lot they could do with these figures that they haven't done. Like you said, the fact that only certain amiibos are getting used kind of stinks. I've got quite a few ideas myself that could really help push amiibos. 

Pokemon games: This is among one of the most obvious to me. You scan an amiibo in, and you get some sort of costume piece for your Trainer (Full-blown costumes even, I'd love to see a Trainer decked out like Link or ). However, if you scan a Pokemon amiibo in, you can use the amiibo as that Pokemon, with the amiibo basically working as an extra Poke Ball. It's your Pokemon that you deck out and battle with. Of course, the amount of Pokemon would be limited, they surely won't make over 600 types of Pokemon amiibos... right? 

Animal Crossing: Basically, cartridges like in the original, or costumes/furniture your character can use.  </TEXT>

As an older brother, it's freaking difficult with my brother and I trying to collect. Marth was sold out Day 1 for me, and I can't find a Captain Falcon anywhere. Luckily, I got my brother his two most wanted, Villager and Little Mac, before they became rare.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Quick question from a younger amiibo hunter </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-02 23:58:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First off, let me just say I'm a sophomore in high school, and not exactly the most persuasive person on the planet. 

I've been on the hunt for amiibos for quite a while, namely a few of the more rare ones (Marth, WFT, Falcon, Pit). I was lucky enough to get Villager and Mac a while back, but otherwise I'm out of luck. I've been calling store after store, and I've noticed that some people are a bit... shady. For instance, one of the Wal-Marts told me that they had nothing but Mario and Pikachu. When I asked if there was by any chance a few amiibos in back, he gave a long pause and then said that what they had out was all they had in-store, and that I'd have better luck looking elsewhere, then hung up. 

While a majority of employees are cool (One Target employee directed me to a store where he'd seen a few Falcons, but they had sold out by then), it's a bit more difficult to approach the shadier ones and call them out. Considering I'm also unable to drive and have very limited access to ordering online (can't import or go over base price, heck I was only able to pre-order 2 amiibos for the next wave), how should I handle trying to search for the ones I'm missing?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I honestly like the idea of an open world type of Sonic game. If they implemented characters right, and still featured some levels like the Classic and Modern styles in Sonic Generations, it would work. I'd love a game like this. 

I think the main problem is transferring the speed and excitement of the previous games over to this open world. What would work best is the Sonic Adventure formula, but with larger levels inbetween the "Gotta go Fast" zones, and a few 2.5D Classic-styled segments as well.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> **1. What amiibo figure would you like to see in the future?:** 

I'd definitely like to see some more varied characters to fill up what Smash Bros. doesn't already have, such as Captain Toad, Waluigi, Ridley, Tom Nook, etc. Plus, third-party figures like Rayman and Bayonetta would be cool. 

**2. What other types of amiibo functionality do you want?:** 

I'd like to see a sandbox-styled game where you can use the characters o build your own games based off their franchises. Think Disney Infinity and LittleBigPlanet combined. Plus, using amiibos as the playable characters, combined with unlocking specific parts/textures/items/vehicles would be cool. 

**3. Thoughts/Suggestions for /r/amiibo (if any):** 

I'd like to see some sort of way to find the amiibos and where they're in stock, such as if they're out of order or if they're exclusives.

A bit off topic, but I'm really hating the fact that 5-6 morons are being used as the definiton of "Ridley supporter" and anyone who does want Ridley is a delusional maniac. I'd appreciate it if every time I get into a debate, people stop pulling the same cards on me and telling me I have no idea what I'm talking about.

<DATE> 2014-11-15 05:29:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, just some quick background here:

I'm by no means the best player. I've played with competitive level players, and I'm always coming out in 2nd or worse. So, it's no big surprise I wasn't doing well. 

Then there's my brother, who's turning 10 a few days before SSB-Wii U drops. He's by all definitions a casual. He mostly spends time in Brawl spamming Toon Link's dair yelling "DUCKTALES!". So, he tagged along when I went to GameStop, hoping to try out the new game. 

There was a group of people that were competitive-level players who were trashing everyone, including me. So, my little brother secretly asks to use my controller so he can play against these guys, and I agreed. They never bothered to look at who was playing.

The two guys both chose Pit, and my brother the Villager. There was a Diddy Kong somewhere, but he died pretty early. Items on, 3 stocks, Palutena's Temple. 

Fast forward to near halfway through. Diddy's gone, and everyone has one stock. The Daybreak item begins to appear. One of the Pits manages to grab two, and the final piece spawns behind my brother. This is when I begin to watch him more carefully. He quickly plants a tree near the Daybreak, and one Pit doesn't see it. He rushes towards the piece, and then BAM. My brother finishes him off with a final blow using the tree. 

My brother pockets the piece and runs. The final Pit, with the other two pieces, begins to rush towards him. What I saw my brother do, this filthy casual who likes to spam attacks and then Kirbycide 90% of the time, really made me proud of him. 

He used Lloid Rocket to space himself decently from the player, and did nothing but constantly avoid the grasp of him by rocketing from one platform to the other, and sometimes using Balloon Fight. He planted trees to create walls in order to get some time. At one point, he landed on the bridge and destroyed it right as Pit landed on it using his Weed Pluck D-Tilt. He continually attacked using the slingshot, and managed to grab nearly every single  arrow this guy threw and shoot it right back. The guy was screaming "Get over here, stop running away! It's my Daybreak!" After managing to rack up enough damage, my brother stops on a platform. He doesn't plant anything, he doesn't do anything, he stands there with enough damage that a good aerial from Pit would kill him. 

The Pit rushed towards him. The platform rose above the ground, and the guy cockily laughs as he jumps onto the platform and stands there. My brother begins to dance. Pit started up the Upperdash Arm, and just as the dance ended, my brother rolled for the first time in history, and then used the twirling stick U-Tilt to land a finishing blow on this guy. 

The player looked at me, and stuck his hand out as a "good game" kind of thing. I told him it wasn't me playing, and my brother grinned ear to ear and started laughing.

This is the kind of stuff I really enjoy seeing. He's never been this excited about a match before, and suddenly he picks up on some techniques he's never used before, and uses them to win against two competitive players. I've started calling him Decky the Destroyer, and he's enjoying every moment of it. 

I really do hope we can see this kind of stuff pop up in the future.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, my personal idea...

**King K. Rool**

N-Special: Bunderbuss. He pulls out his blunderbuss and fires a cannonball. Comparable to Bowser Junior's N-Special. A character can kick it in any direction assuming their move has enough knockback. He can charge this move, and if uncharged, the cannonball will drop right in front of him, and can be used as a Soccer Ball type item for K. Rool. 

* N-Special 2: *Blunderbuss Gas*. K. Rool fires a burst of slow-moving poisonous gas instead of a cannonball. If an opponent gets trapped in it, it'll be a continuous attack that doesn't make opponents flinch, like Fox's laser or Palutena's Heavenly Light. Think the Ashley Assist Trophy in cloud form. 

* N-Special 3: *Blunderbuss Dash*. Instead of firing a cannonball, the blast from the blunderbuss can be used to dash K. Rool forwards or backwards. Wonderful for moving across the stage. 

S-Special: *Crown Toss*. K. Rool throws his crown as a boomerang attack. It acts a lot like you'd expect, except it's multi-hit and can trap opponents on the way back. He can still move around while it moving, and activate other moves, but once it touches K. Rool again, it will return to him, allowing for some insane mind games. 

* S-Special 2: *Crown Shot* K. Rool can throw the crown faster and farther, but at the cost of charging it. 

* S-Special 3: *Crown Volley*. A lot like the actual Boomerang item, K.  
Rool can hit the B Button again to launch the crown back. 

Up Special: *Helicopter Pack*. K. Rool pulls out his helicopter pack from DKC3 and uses it to fly upwards. The blades are a hitbox, but K. Rool is vulnerable everywhere else. Once the move is over, it'll disappear and he'll go into freefall. 

* U-Special 2: *Electric Pack*. It has an electric effect and can damage opponents on the way up, but it has a shorter range. 

*U-Special 3: *Explosive Pack*. It will explode with high knockback at the climax of the attack. K. Rool will take 5% damage if it happens, but he'll receive no knockback. 

D-Special: *Kremling Krush*. A lot like Bowser Bomb, except it creates a rather large shockwave that traps opponents. References his DK64 fight. 

* D-Special 2: Kremling Jump*. He'll jump upwards with great force and a gust effect, but the move can be cancelled into an aerial.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> All the references to the Sorcerer's Apprentice made me freak out, especially the broom and turning the apprentice into a mouse. As a huge fun of the Mickey shorts and films, this was amazing. 

Henry as the new Sorcerer's Apprentice makes sense. He's the one that reunites all of these fairy tales, and will obviously be playing with some magic. He's our human Mickey, and I honestly couldn't be happier.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Turns out a few other characters were announced a while back:

-Paper Mario. Paper Mario lacks range by himself, so summoning his partners will allow him to control the stage and combo with speed. 

-Lip. Her wand will drain health from enemies, so naturally her weaker attacks are powered up when you use them in tandem with her flower powers. Racking up damage has never been so satisfying. 

-Robotnik. This is a upgrade character. He can use his skills to repair his weaponry, allowing him to increase power, range and knockback. All of this disappears when he's KO'd, though. A good example is his recovery, the jetpack. It will blast farther and release more flames as it's upgraded. Think Engineer from TF2 and Lucas from PM combined. 

That's all I can reveal at the moment, but we're working furiously.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It will definitely lean towards Melee, but with mechanics from SSB64/Brawl/SSB4. Veterans are definitely getting some updates to better fit their character or to help them in combat. For instance, a good example is Mario, who's recovery is being boosted and with a bit of extra power. This includes giving him a Ground Pound stall-then-fall dair, buffing the Super Jump Punch, and other things.  Many characters will receive changes to differ themselves from not only their console interpretations, but Project M and other fan game interpretations as well. It won't be Melee 2.0 or Brawl 2.0.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Veterans are the main focus currently, but there are quite a few newcomers that are being planned, mostly to fill certain fighting game archetypes and provide a unique Smash Bros. experience. The Balloon Fighter is the main character from one of Nintendo's original NES titles, Balloon Fight. He's recently been a trophy in Melee, had music in Brawl, was a featured game in Nintendo Land and is in the NES Remix games.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We're keeping it very low-key for the moment, when the demo comes out I'd definitely appreciate some assistance in patching it for problems. We're trying to make it the same core as Smash Bros. with the best mechanics from different installments, yet add enough new mechanics to differentiate it from any previous or upcoming Smash. It's likely the full version won't be out until after SSB4.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> -There aren't any OCs in this game. All veterans are hopefully going to be implemented into the game before the final version. 

-This game brings the best of each Smash game together, as well as introduce new things from other fighters and Nintendo games that wouldn't be in the upcoming SSB4. 

-Our coders and spriters do. I've worked a small amount, and do know a bit of coding, but I'm able to manage the team efficiently and help assist them if needed. 

-I'm trying my best to make this happen so that it's available on Mac, PC and Linux. It may take a while, though. 

-Affinity is a work in progress name, it's based off of a new mechanic we're implementing into the game, but I can't reveal it until we can definitely put it into the game.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been thinking about that, and I'm planning on putting a lot of work into making sure animations are smooth and flow like a model would. This will likely give more of a cartoony feel to the game, but it fits the premise nicely. For instance, an attack to the face will actually affect the face, not just put them into a damage animation. Characters will react to their surroundings instead of just having inputs.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem is that, while P:M has great gameplay and SSF2 the pixel art, they both lack new Nintendo characters with moveset capability.

<TEXT> I can tell you right now that there aren't any anime characters on the roster currently. The rule for third-parties (and, by extension, fourth parties) is that they must have had an appearance on a Nintendo console, their games are well-remembered, and made an impact on the console they appeared on, or gaming in general. An example is Sonic, Mega Man, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, this means that we'll be implementing techniques from both. For instance, pivot grabs from Brawl will be added, and we're contemplating a lot of different techniques from Melee, such as moonwalking. 

For characters, a lot of moves are taking more reference to the character's origins. While this does spice up characters a little bit, characters like Dr. Mario (assuming we add him in later) will likely take more scrapped parts from their original counterparts to make them more unique. A example off the top of my head would be that Mario gets the F.L.U.D.D. while Dr. Mario keeps the Mario Tornado.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> I'm developing a Smash fangame. Suggestions? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-06 22:38:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi, I'm test_subject6948 and I'm developing a game currently titled "Super Smash Bros. Affinity". It's main goal is to take the best from Smash 64, Melee, Brawl and SSB4, and put it into a free online game that people can pick up and play. Currently, a very basic demo is expected by July, but I need some fan input. Here's what I can tell you so far:

-The game is sprited, similarily to that of Smash Bros. Crusade and Smash Flash 2. We're currently using sprites from other sources in the demo, but custom sprites will be added soon. 

-The game's main goal is to focus on improving veterans and mechanics first, but we can promise you that many newcomers will appear eventually. 

-The game will attempt to reach the speed of Melee, but appeal to Brawl players as well. 

-We're mainly keeping it to Nintendo and some of it's third-party affiliates. 

-A variety of Nintendo characters will appear, such as Mario, Link, Samus and Ness, alongside newcomers such as the Balloon Fighter, who's main focus is stage control and lightning-fast aerial combos, as long as you avoid getting your balloons popped.

-Stages include iconic locations from previous games, such as PictoChat, Mario Galaxy and Onett, as well as new stages like Mt. Dedede and Kokiri Forest. 

I'd truly appreciate the input on ideas or suggestions, and a link to some in-development pictures is below. Thank you for your assistance.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was thinking to myself a few nights ago, and with all the Classic Mega Man stuff happening lately, I thought up two ideas for Mega Man fan games:

1. Mega Man: Worlds Collide. Basically, it's the Mega Man Archie crossover with Sonic, but in game form! Play as Mega Man or Sonic, and fight the 8 Roboticized Masters (Shadow, Knuckles, Amy, Vector, Charmy, Espio, Blaze, Silver) and summon in Tails or Rush for assistance. 

2. Mega Man Smash. Mega Man vs. the 8 original fighters from Smash Bros: Mario, Link, Samus, Kirby, Pikachu, DK, Fox and Yoshi. 

They're kind of stupid, but I'd like to know if anybody else would be interested in doing this before I scrap 'em.  </TEXT>
