I wouldn't be here if I had nothing to lose. I'd be gone, but I'm afraid of failing and going back to a place I feel was worse than hell. I'm here, talking to all of you because I want so badly to just have something happen to me, but couldn't do it to myself.

I don't know what to do. </TEXT>

It's just that though, I'm lazy, or selfish, or something but I just can't help people, but feel like shit that I can't. I've pretty much determined the best way to help people is to not exist at all in my case. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I awoke with a jerk.

Today was the day, the day I would finally get to ask Lord Willakers my question. He was returning today after going to H'cet to assess the damage the elves had inflicted.

Long ago, Lord Willakers ruled over an area within a land called Dong Dank; a place filled with dwarves that acted like all sorts of races, but the pure would reside in the Dwarven District, which he ruled. However, ages ago this place fell into disarray, with warring factions and accidental destruction plaguing the land, Willakers set out for a new homeland for his dwarves.

In his travels, he came upon what we now call a shrine. Hidden deep within the Chocolate Mountains, it had a sort of allure to it, a glow and a power that made him feel stronger and more agile. Finding no adverse effects, he would return to Dong Dank and would make an announcement: all the dwarves that wanted to live in general peace, come with him.

Most of Dwarven District did, with a few from the other districts coming as well. They would build a stone keep in those mountains, centered around the shrine they now praised. This is where I am now; Mount Willakers.

I sprung from my spot on the floor to my feet and put on my boots. We don't have much for commodities here but I was able to fasten myself a pair after collecting bits of leather for weeks. I headed outside the great entrance and looked out into the field. Around the entrance we had a wall, and past that, a camp filled with makeshift tents and campfires. You would think we hadn't been here long, but in fact, we've been here ages.

My great-great-great-etc. grandfather came here from the Dwarven District, and I was raised here in Mount Willakers. Our infatuation with the shrines seemed to halt all other progression of our construction, and so we've lived in a camp of tents for centuries. Being one of the original dwarven families however, I was able to sleep inside, which was a treat, as the weather we've been having recently was rather dreary.

Out into the distance I saw the source of our blight in recent times, as storm so black we thought it may have been bugs instead of clouds. It had been swirling for weeks and stayed just to the edge of the field, by the hills at the front. I walked over and found myself a chair, it wouldn't be long before Willakers arrived.

Slowly a crowd would build by the outskirts of the field, awaiting his arrival. Many dwarves adored the Old Man, and while I could say I did, at the same time I was not infatuated with him. He was a dwarf, same as us all, more powerful yes, but just dwarf all the same. After a few hours, I finally spotted him, coming over the hills with his companions; Nisovin, another Lord of Dong Dank, but also the last known Gnome of his time, and Roamin, a rank 11 paladin that was a descendant of the Lord of Brickton.

A path formed between the dwarves for them. Fearing the Old Man's death stare, they knew they had to step out of the way, or be made to. I stayed where I was, I was in no rush, as Willakers would of course remember that it was my turn for a question, an inquiry, and that I would not have to bother him with such petty reminders.

But he didn't, he walked by with his group of gawkers and proceeded to the entrance.

"Well, maybe he did just forget, he is rather busy." I muttered to myself, grudgingly. 

I walked up behind him as he observed the group of dwarves around him, and tapped him on the shoulder.

"YOUNG DWARF, YOU DARE TOUCH ME." He bellowed, with genuine anger in his voice.

"Well, Mr. Willakers, it's just..." I said, trailing off.

"JUST WHAT, WHAT COULD BE SO IMPORTANT YOU TOUCH ME?" He yelled, louder this time.

"Well, today is my question day, and you just, wandered by, is all." I said to him, half shaking.

"Oh, I see, I'll be right with you, sit back over there." He pointed at the seat I had been in.

I put my head down and walked back, sat and observed him. He dismissed his two companions and talked to a few dwarves before he walked over to me, and pulled over a chair.

He sat down and produced a flask of juice from his pocket, swigging it and then putting it back.

"H'cet survived, barely. They've begun to rebuild and this time, will better protect their shrine." 

I stayed quiet. It did intrigue me, these other shrines. Long after Mount Willakers was founded, other dwarves would venture out and discover more, and under the Old Man's guide, would build more keeps around them to protect them from any attacking force. H'cet was one of these, a smaller one, but extremely fortified as it sat right at the edge of Elf land.

"Well, I suppose I should get going quickly, so, what is your question?" He asked, before preparing to stand up.

"Yes sir, of course, well I wanted to know if...." 

BOOM. A lightning strike from the storm beyond, but not just a normal weather occurrence, this was blinding, even for the Old Man. After my eyes readjusted, I gazed out and saw a new anomaly in the sky. 

A dark cloud? No, it looked, like a ship. 

"Dear God, I knew this day would come." Willakers said under his breath.

"We have until nightfall. GET THE WEAPONS READY, FORGE ARMOR, BUILD A WALL, WE NEED THIS PLACE READY FOR WAR, NOW." He screamed out, so that all dwarves could hear.

I was dumbfounded, I had never seen such a structure before and nor had many of the other dwarves, but I did as the Old Man said. I found myself a juice, a runeblade, and a shortbow, and got to work. I was given armor and fletched arrows until nightfall.

We all stood at the edge of the massive forward wall we erected, stretching halfway across the field.

Beside me, another dwarf would remark "I feel kinda sick.", with a few others around making moans and one falling over.

All of a sudden, my comrade fell flat, and then, within seconds, would spring back up, with his flesh falling from his face and armor shedding off, he began to run at me, maw wide open.

Practicing long ago with a sword and bow, I knew the basics of their function but not much else. I swung wildly at him, successfully pushing him back so he could not bite me, and instead ran after another dwarf. After some time, these "zombie" dwarves would drop dead, and dissolve into the ground.

But this wasn't the worst, floods of monsters, ranging from zombies to wolverines were springing from the ship and decending upon the land. We would do our best to defend against them, shooting and swinging at whatever wasn't dwarf. Many of our men began to realize that our blades and shovels had magical properties, that they could roll and "proc" monsters in quick succession after killing one. Using this to our advantage, we would push back the monsters many times to their ship, but when night fell, they pushed back. Hard.

We would be driven back to the inner wall, then the inside entrance, and eventually we found ourselves in the halls, tandem sword fighting and proccing anything that moved. We could hold, but not forever, and eventually we were pushed into the shrine room itself.

The shrine's light, while empowering us, was beginning to dim, as more and more monsters piled in, until finally, it gave way, and after a thunderous BOOM. I found myself without weapons or armor, and suffered a quick death.

Or did I?

I then woke up, found myself on the floor of Mount Willakers once more, with Willakers shouting at the men to armor up and build a wall to defend against the zombie hordes.

"Oh no, not again." I said, with a sigh.

It's endless. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Weapon:** Orion

A "silver" sword that does 15 attack damage and blinds mobs, making them slowed. The glint of the blade is was blinds them, its very bright. This sword is weilded by the Deathseeker, a dwarf with immense power, as he is the only one that can use it.

**Weapon:** Brenna

Its mine. A bow that has such a graceful "twang" when she fires, she pierces the hearts of mobs with double damage, and a spurt of fire erupts around the mob for a second. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a rather depressed person. For about 5 years of my life, I felt lost, without anything to aim for in my life but maybe a chance I could find a reason. And then, one day, after a bit of time, I found that reason.

I found her.

And I know what you're thinking, he's going to kill himself over a girl, it's not worth it, I know that.

She was more than a girl, she was my reason to live.

We met eachother through a game, we lived across an ocean from eachother. We loved eachother, but we had issues with what we did by ourselves. Me much more than her. I cause breaks like this with everyone. I don't have friends, I don't know where to get help, I was sent to a mental hospital, it fixed nothing, my following therapist, nothing.

I am talking here, because I had no friends. Everyone I have ever talked to has one way or another turned out to hate me. I just wanted someone to talk to, that's all. I have little hope, but I need to know if someone, anyone out there cares about who I am for more than just a human, for me, JT.

And if there is not, then may there be salvation beyond.

<TITLE> [Dwarves vs. Zombies] - The Deathseeker </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-22 05:33:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I walked into the room, instantly feeling a sense of, *emptiness* in the room. It was clearly lit by the full panel windows along the walls, but the light didnt reach the back recesses, to the staircase. It was nearing night, and patrol would need to start again to keep the monsters out. It had been a few days since the last attack, and the pink sky out the window seemed to fully encompass that bliss that many of them had been feeling. They were still warned however, to not go beyond the shrines reach, because if they do and die out there, they would not have the shrines timewarp ability, and they would be eternally doomed to a death of nothingness. 

I sat down in the chair outwards from the table, and had a look around. The room was mostly bare, but bookcases lined the walls that the windows did not. Books filled with history and knowledge of the Dwarves past and even before that, before the calamity. These books and this house held the utmost importance to this outpost, as this was home to the second oldest living dwarf, and not only was he the ancient in his status, but he is also ancient in name. He is the last surviving titled warrior of the dwarves, a practice that was ceased a long time ago, after one certain title was killed beyond the shrine. After that title died, The Old Man never titled another dwarf again, realizing that giving these warriors titles and then losing them was causing more morale loss among the dwarves than needed, and was unnecessary. 

Slowly, more and more of the remaining titles were lost to the place beyond shrine jurisdiction, and eventually that left one. At 23 dwarven lifetimes, he is only four lifetimes younger than The Old Man himself, and because of this, he experienced much of the important events that had befallen the dwarves. So, this dwarf, was forever to have the occupation of The Rememberer, which has now become his name, as no other name seems to fall upon him. His job was to answer the dwarves any questions they might have that could pertain to the past and all events in it to his knowledge. 

Thats what I was here for, I had vaguely heard rumors and seen inscriptions of one certain topic in particular and I had come to ask The Rememberer if he knew its origin or meaning. The question befell on me each night when I saw a vision of the inscription each time I shut my eyes, of the bright blade that shone brighter than all others, but was not that legendary sword of the Old Mans , but was another, beside his, with another name below it.

While in thought, a small, quiet voice asked me, Yes, Jimmy, what are you here for? What is it that you seek to learn?

He slowly walked to me, with a cane in hand, and sat in the chair infront of mine. He sat there, giving me a questioning gaze with that bright blue eye of his. He only had one, the other was lost lifetimes ago, in another battle; no one had asked. He had one rule about questions of the past, no dwarf was to ever ask about *him* and his involvement in dwarven lore, and so the mystery of his eye and his title are known to very few surviving dwarves, and they do not utter a single word. 

I quickly composed myself and as fast as I could asked the question that was burning inside my mind, Who was; The Deathseeker?

Excuse me son, what was that? He asked, as if completely dumbfounded that such an audacious question could befall upon him.

Well, sir, I had been seeing some visions of an inscription I saw a little bit ago

I dont need backstory, he interrupts, just ask the question again.

Well, who was the Deathseeker?

He sat there for a few moments, and put his face in his hands, for several minutes he sat in silence, and then very quickly outbursted, I dont know what youre talking about, Im sorry, I dont have that information, goodbye.

Dont you think they have a right to know, JT? a soft, low voice said. Across the room near the door stood none other than the General himself, OldManWillakers.

No, Bruce, they dont, it need not concern them and theres no reason to lose more lives because of a dumb prophecy. The longer they dont know, the better. The Rememberer said, very quickly and coldy to the General. It had surprised me to hear him say The Old Mans first name, something no other dwarf had ever said and lived to say again.

Just because you refuse to use its power because of your loss does not mean another Deathseeker cant after you. There is no reason to be withholding this information from them, it doesnt hurt them to know, if they want to know, tell them. She was important to me too, you know The Old Man said.

It doesnt hurt them not to know either Bruce, so what does it really matter? And please, dont talk about her. The Rememberer said, almost moving to tears over his last statement.

I began to tune out their bickering as it seemed not to be going anywhere important, just endless arguing, so I began to look about the room some more. Something I had appeared to miss now shone from the falling sun, up against the wall by the staircase was two very unique items. One of them I very clearly recognized, was the bow known as Brenna, used by the Ranger JT, who had supposedly fallen many lifetimes ago, one of the first to fall. However, he did note that Bruce had called The Rememberer JT, and no one had ever asked about JT specifically in the past, it was possible that the dwarf standing before him was JT himself, but it didnt change much if he was, beyond the name. 

The other weapon however, was more curious. A shiny Silver Blade sat in a glass case, and I couldnt look directly at it, as the shine off of it made it nearly impossible to do so. Its shape was not unlike that of the Dwarven Runeblade, yet, slightly bulkier. It did not have the same bend of a holy blade, this sword was much different from them.

The Old Man and JT seemingly stopped arguing, with The Old Man walking up to me, saying The Rememberer here has agreed to give you your answer, but I am going to give it to you.

The Deathseeker is a legendary hero of the dwarves, able to unlock the power of a sword nearly as powerful as Excaliju; Orion, the Silver Blade.

I glanced back over at the case, this sword seemingly to fit the description.

This blade could blind the monsters with its shine, and cripple them from escape, allowing for an easy powerful swing to end their undead lives. Only one Deathseeker can live at one time, and when one passes, another can then realize his potential with the Blade. The Old Man explained.

However, the last Deathseeker to be known did not use the Blade, and instead kept its knowledge from the dwarves for thousands of years, as well as hiding its prophecy and inscriptions.

The current Deathseeker is the man that stands before you, and that is his blade, in the case, never to be used until he passes

Never to be used again, I hope. JT interrupts.

You wasted your ability to use that blade, you could have helped purify so many places and you wasted it. Bruce sternly said.

Because that sword gives nothing but trouble, and I wanted nothing to do with spreading its curse to others. JT retaliated.

The curse is a small price to pay for power. Bruce said.

It wasnt a small price JT trailed off, seemingly on the break of tears, Get out Jimmy, thats the story, now leave. 

I got up and left the room, heading out back to my barracks to start my shift on patrol, and think over what I just learned.

<TEXT> Honestly, although matt is in a case of ban evasion, he was only banned for bad fellowship, and so he himself is not cheating, and all his kills are legit, as one person, as much as he can play. FWP is not one person, can play any maximum of its time its members are on, and while there isn't modded clients in use as far as we know, and play time is not a bannable by any means, it seems very unsportsman-like to use one single account just for the purpose of bringing someone who got all his kills as one person, fairly, down, just on account of his past ban that doesn't have anything to do with his ability to kill.

tl;dr, Op got his kills as one person, fairly, it's unsportsmanlike to use a group on one account to do the same. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sadly, I would not put it past some people that were once or still are in the community to do these things. Some groups are maliciously toxic, while others are very very nice. The thing is, those that are toxic are sometimes the popular ones, and they are part of the reason I am no longer playing on the server. My situation, as well as another friend of mine's are very similar to your's in terms of falling into a depression. I do not attribute these people alone as the cause of this, but I do site them as partial reason, as well as the boards, and other goings on in my life. It makes me very sad to see a community fall into something like this, but I am happy that someone brought it to light, something I couldn't do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They do get damage immunity, however, because their death is by a spell, they can be "tagged" by a player, and when they blow up it registers as a kill. This works for all mobs that die a suicide type of death, like Seppukus. so it appears like they have no immunity if you just looked at kill feeds, but they do have it. </TEXT>

<TITLE> DvZ Update 3/22 - Map Changes </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-03-23 02:20:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After several Test games run by Nisovin, a very small update was rolled out to Dogekac and Daragor, plus a removal of a certain mob.

* **Dogekac** was known for having a large amount of **holes in the bedrock** to bypass certain areas, such as at the front of the keep, there being holes under the lights, straight to the Inner Shrine. **These holes are now filled in.**
* Speaking of **Inner Shrine**...It **was removed**, there are now two shrines. The Bridge Shrine, and the Final Shrine.
* **Daragor's mob spawn was pushed back**, the tools tables were moved slightly over, and many trees were added abouts the front. The **mob protection is slightly forward**, to about **4 or so blocks infront of the shovel table.**
* ~~Unless the RNG was being very harsh to the **Spider Kings** in the games I played, they are **removed.**~~  *Saw some in a Dogekac game, JT is wroooooooooooooooooooong.*
* **Armor is not throwable anymore**, it will teleport back into your inventory.  ~~This means you CANNOT be rearmored.~~ *Unless, of course, all of your armor breaks.*


* You can now be rearmored if you are missing a piece of your armor, such as a helmet, and it will be re-equipped. No need to drop all your armor anymore. (Thanks Nis!)

The Shepherd of Fire may have 10 items that he CAN spawn with, but may only relieve 5 or so, making every Shepherd unique. </TEXT>

<TEXT> More balancement changes, and reintroduction of an old map.

* Daragor has been readded, using the multiple shrine system, has 3 shrines: the Gate Shrine, the Juice Shrine, and the Final Shrine, each on a layer of the map.
* Armor, when repaired, gives 160 durability per repair, rather than 100 from before.
* When dropped, an armor piece ends up in oblivion, and is gone forever. (Remember, if you require a new set, throw away ALL of your old set.)
* Mount Willakers' shrines were reduced to two: the Courtyard Shrine behind the front wall, and the Final Shrine.
* Each map has a monster spawn debuff/protection, that deals a dwarf nausea and a bit of poison if within the radius. (This has the unfortunate effect of blocking dwarves from the cave on Dogekac, unsure if intentional or not.) The debuff is the same amount of nausea, but the poison starts as a very low amount, and then after about 5 seconds, becomes poison III.
* Dogekac's lobby is no longer destructable.
* **As of the 27th,** Dogekac's shrines were changed as well, to 3 shrines: Bridge, Inner, Final. **THIS IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE** </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your last point would be extremely cruel, because we just want to play games like anyone else, that's why titles don't have  more powerful weapons (with the exception of the Staff, dealing an extra half heart) so I see no reason why we should be hindered, just because we are titled. There are plenty of people without titles that are better than me, and they wouldn't be hindered. Also, I see no reason to nerf procs, and rob has mentioned before, he will not do any rebalancing until after heroes are reintroduced, but I think procs are fine, in my opinion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For my own input...

Wolves do not require regen unless you lower their durability, because they are able to 3 shot any dwarf outside, and if they can't be set back by low health, then they will absolutely destroy.

I can see skeletons taking more than one hit, don't get me wrong, but to give skeletons infinite arrows, does two bad things, allows hackers to use auto fire, and gives no hindrance to skeleton assaults, they can just continually push uncontested.

Creepers should not take more than one bow shot, they deal 7 hearts of damage up to 4 blocks away, 3 creepers can destroy a wall, and they can move rather quickly. Super Creepers should NEVER take more than one shot, if they are 4 blocks away from a dwarf under or on equal footing as him, it will just kill the dwarf 99% of the time. 

The digging zombie has enough pick to get through one wall, that is quite enough if you ask me. Really Digging zombies are near useless, since going through a wall doesn't do anything much, so really I think they should be removed.

Spider Kings, afaik, are being removed, and if they aren't, they can take you to half a heart in 20 seconds.

Spiderlings, they have a high maneuverability, so they should be able to dodge hits, not take them. I don't contest higher poison if the spider king is removed, but if it's not, spiderlings can take you to half a heart in 35 seconds, and every time you heal, you delay your mana regen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To elaborate on who all the old heroes were: BruceWillakers, LanceWillakers, GoldfounderPause, CaptainBoulderFist, NisovinsIllusion, Deadbones, LadyKedemonia, and RoaminThePaladin.

* BruceWillakers had possession of Virendra, a bow with Punch 10 and one shotted all monsters except golems, and Excaliju, a weapon with greatly increased damage and proc time.
* LanceWillakers did not have a special weapon, but it is speculated that he will get his (axe?) that he uses in Death Fears Me.
* Pause had a bow that one shots all mobs, like Virendra.
* Guude had Frostshock, which I believe was a chain lightning weapon.
* Nisovin had the Tinder Flame, which was meant to do splash damage, when hitting a mob, but was never completed/fixed, and the Wriggly Wrench, that acted as a melee weapon, and when used on another dwarf, repaired all his armor.
* Deadbones, as you may have guessed, had his EZFIX SLABS, which placed a large temporary wall in front of himself and could also remotely place blocks.
* Lady Kedemonia had the Regrowth Star, which could remotely heal dwarves, and death grip monsters, pulling them to her.
* Roamin had the Holy Purifier. It's a flamethrower. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-02-03 03:17:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> To add onto the updates of last night, some minor tweaks and changes were made to the game, and one big one:

* Invulnerability has been reduced (10 seconds)
* Creepers **do not** receive invulnerability.
* Wood working has been redone: 1. Torches take significantly longer to make. 2. All wood products are **transmuted one to one** (I.E. One plank = one stick **except in the case of sticks to bowls, which is still one to four**). 3. When a bowl is used in oil, it will produce 4 mortar.
* The only ~~map~~ **maps** at this moment are Mount Willakers, Oasis, and Dogekac as the other maps need to be changed to accommodate multiple shrines. 
* **Multiple shrines have been added:** Instead of one shrine, there are several, which must be captured **in order** (1st, 2nd, 3rd) for the monsters to win. It seems to take **less time to capture** each of these points, and once one is captured, the **monster spawn is moved on to or close to it.**
* A monster **cannot** pass the shrine currently being attacked, else it is struck by lightning, and dies. **I'm unsure on this, but this seems to have broken the "Infection" plague, because the instant the infected turn, they die to the shrine's fail safe.**
* **All maps** now has starting supplies, of about 20 - 40 of mortar, cobble, and torches.
* At least from what I could tell, past shrine 2, monsters that turn into Super Creepers will do so on the spot.

I figured I would write another one of these to go into detail of the changes, but if Rob and Nis would like me to remove/stop these in favor of the Trello list system, I gladly will if they ask. 

* Link to the Trello here: https://trello.com/b/Wi2Di0qF/playmindcrack 

More features, yay! 

* Oasis returns with 2 shrines.
* Dogekac has 4 shrines. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, as you may know, DvZ is still a WIP, as heroes are not finished, sounds still need to be added, and new maps are still needed. However, there was another "balancement" update rather than "content" update today, and these are the changes I observed:

* Procs are now limited to within 5 blocks of your person, so basically, **bow proccing is removed.**
* Golems are readded, ~~however, spawn with only a seppuku, so they do not have much of a function other than a walking damage soaker.~~ **They now spawn once again with the ancient pick.**
* **Healing ale now uses 150 mana** rather than 200 from before.
* Mount Willakers has invulnerability added upon monster spawn (18 seconds).
* As of this moment, ~~I did not see any instances of squid (maybe rarer?)~~, ~~wolves (also rarer?)~~, ~~or the map oasis (removed?)~~ ~~and have not played on any map other than Mt Willy to see if they have arrow invul too~~.
* ~~WE GOT FANCY SPECIAL MONSTER MESSAGES, I LOVE YOU ALL.~~ **SPIDER KING MESSAGES ARE MESSED UP, PRAISE REDACTED.**

I myself enjoy these changes, it makes indoor combat easier, shields have more use outside, and spawn camping isn't devastating anymore, at least from what I observed.

As stated by nisovin below: 

* **Sword damage was increased to 10** rather than 8 (~~**PALADINS, USE THE RUNEBLADE, THE HOLY BLADE IS NOT UPDATED**~~ Fixed.).
* All map's invulnerability was increased (18 seconds).
* Squids are, in fact, removed.
* Oasis, is in fact, removed.
* Holy Blades and Longbows are shiny again, keep in mind they **DO NOT** do anything extra, just shine.

In a speculation: (as per substitutemyown): An event, rather it be randomly occurring (most likely this, as if it were a special monster event almost) or admin controlled, that occurs during the day known as the Solar Eclipse will block out the sun, and cause havoc among the dwarves, as the zombies regain their buff.

Side note, I would gladly make more of these if people want, it's kinda fun, always pondered the idea of a constantly changing guide, maybe one day... :P </TEXT>

<TITLE> The UHCS Skype Chat </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-09-05 02:44:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The UHCS skype chat, as I understand it, is for us to socialize, and it has been that way for a while, but or some reason lately it is filled with uninteresting, stupid guff that most people don't want to read or care about. Myself and many others have left the chat for this reason, where we were mostly there for information about the server, the occasional conversation was fine, but it had gotten out of hand.

A long time ago when the server was smaller and there were way less people, me and MG had a very long conversation about random stuff, that we were promptly told by many to stop, which we did, and talked in a private chat.

What I'm asking is to stop all this random stuff on the chat, and bring it back to its original purpose, the way it should be and was meant to be, not some role-playing chat with random topics that mean nothing to the chat. This is a plea for order, for the way things should be, not a spam-filled chat with things you can do elsewhere. </TEXT>

<TEXT> DO NOT EVER PLAY THIS GUYS GAMES...
Even for his first game, this is wildly unacceptable, he did not pregen or cut off the whitelist, leading to 30 minutes of trying to kick people to lower the player count. Then, the game was changed to FFA due to issues, (which is fine), however, then the host made himself "a walking pinata" with a sharp V sword and full diamond. I said that this was F-ing Stupid, and to that, he said, that this was a "random game" when infact it was a Reddit To2, not an FFA by some nitwit, even though thats what it ended up being. Do not play in this hosts games, unless you want to waste your time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Practice your pvp overall, and start with an FFA, learn the basics, maybe some tactics, and listen to what some people say in chat, because while sometimes it is really annoying things that arent relevant, sometimes it is helpful. Keep the mentality too at the start of the game, that you will only have 10 hearts, and thats it.

And remember, baby zombies will eat your face, skellies have aimbot, and that the nether is over-powered. </TEXT>

-Don't make PvP instantaneous, turn it off until first night or second day.
-Make the spawn box bigger and within the borders, the constant teleporting was quite annoying.

I do however, like your endgame of a re-scatter, and I would appreciate you trying again :) </TEXT>
