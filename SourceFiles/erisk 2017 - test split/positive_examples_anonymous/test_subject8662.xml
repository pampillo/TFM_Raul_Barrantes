<TEXT> I'm working towards being a screen writer and my father, not raised in the most enlightened of atmospheres, has said he thinks I should do a story about the challenges of a same sex couple raising a child of the opposite gender. I didn't think that would be that interesting as I didn't see that there would be that much difference from a regular couple; he thinks issues of sex and puberty would be more difficult to go over without a member of the opposite sex. What are your experiences? Is it that different from your heterosexual friends or is my dad completely off base? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Kev, First off thanks for all that you do, the pods and the flicks have been a huge influence on me.
Second, This is a tired ass question but very important to me right now so if you'll allow, I write screenplays with a partner and we're nearing completion on a few we're pretty satisfied with. I know you're all about the get a camera and do it yourself and we would love to but we don't have the money, time, equipment, or talent pool to draw from. If we're going the "old Hollywood route" what's our best bet for getting our stuff out there and maybe getting some representation/work? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't know where else to post this story so I'll try commiserating with yall. I ordered a year in time portrait for my mother On Dec 2nd from the website www.plowhearth.com/ after a little over a week I emailed, and received a response stating i had to allow 3 weeks, which was not stated anywhere on their site. After another week and a half I called and was routed to the shipping department (bad sign.) The shipping department said they would leave a message with Service and I would receive a callback tomorrow. This process repeated itself three more times up until today, where they said that it had shipped fedex direct and no tracking information was available. So my gift for my mother has yet to arrive with 30 hours to Christmas. Do not order from plow   hearth if you need your order inside of a month apparently. So reddit, what's your story?

<TEXT> I moved in with my best friend and his girlfriend last June, my first apartment outside of my parents house. It has not been... great. just typed the following in facebook chat: 
[Tue Apr 24 2012 12:15:14 AM] Verbal27: I feel like I'm going to vomit because I just ate most of a box of penne pasta. Why did I do this? Because I wanted spaghetti but I was out and I noticed [McDouche] and [Lady McDouche] had like 9 different boxes of the same three kinds of pasta, that they clearly kept forgetting that they bought already and kept re buying. So i thought of the snide remark [McDouche] would make upon finding some of his pasta consumed "See you got into the pene there, we were uh... actually lookin at maybe using that for dinner tonight." And I thought of the glee I would feel upon pointing out the hypocrisy and falseness of that statement. So I cooked, and I ate, beyond my capacity. In short, I just hate fucked a box of my former best friends pasta with my mouth
[Tue Apr 24 2012 12:21:58 AM] Verbal's friend: ...
[Tue Apr 24 2012 12:22:09 AM] Verbal's friend: Hate is a wonderful thing

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In High School, my friend, we'll call him A (I don't give a fuck about his anonymity, you'll find out why in a second, but I do want to keep within guidelines) was the one person who was there for me by my side through everything. We met pretty soon after I transferred in my sophomore year, and were best of friends since then. He was like a brother to me and it's a stupid cliche but I would have taken a bullet for him. We had a bit of a falling out after I went to college and weren't as close but I still considered him one of my closest friends and we kept in touch until about midway through senior year. 

Late last year I found out why we fell out of touch, he was arrested on 16 counts of possessing and distributing child porn. He was sentenced last month to four years in jail, much to lenient in my opinion.

Reddit, I just can't reconcile this. He was a brother to me and all of a sudden he's this despicable piece of human filth. I can't stop hating him for this, when people around me are telling me he has a sickness and I should pity him. Have any of you had an experience like this where your image of someone was completely and irrevocably shattered. How did you reconcile the old experiences with the new person? Can you even?

TL;DR High school best friend turns out to be CP loving scumbad, can't figure out how to deal.  </TEXT>

 That's what I was initially diagnosed with a year ago. At the time it was atypical because I could sleep and find some joy in day to day life. Less so now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a very tauist way of looking at things, I can definitely see how that could help some people. I personally feel that if the problem is chemical than focus alone won't help, but again, the brain is crazy strange and powerful so I can see how it may work for some people. That's one of the reasons I'm exploring meditation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's essentially when you have dysthmia mixed with a major depressive disorder.

Dysthymia is the more common thing that most people will get at some point in their lives. It's minor but it can get overwhelming and crippling. When people say they feel trapped and can never feel happy, that's usually recurring Dysthymia.

Double depression takes that and combines it with a major depressive disorder. Which has a quicker onset and greater initial impact. So when you mix the two together, it's like taking on someone else's heavy camping backpack while you're already lugging two armfuls of your own shit up a hill.

It gets to the point where (unless you also have an anxiety disorder) you don't worry about anything because nothing matters, nothings ever going to pull you out of this. No one's been in your tunnel before, sure they've had their own tunnels but yours is different and no one has a map to it, so you just wander. 

It's not that I'm ok with it, I've just lived so long with it it's a part of me and I had to develop the sense of humor to not open a couple veins in a bathtub lest things get so damn dark. 

Thanks for the question! Let me know if I can help anymore.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Repost: A couple of minor things here and there, increased lethargy, ambivalence. The major one though was a few weeks ago I lost 10 hours. I work in a place where my day is split between two sites. I work in one for 7 hours, and another across the street for the last two. A few weeks ago I was gathering my things to leave at 7, and then woke up at 5 o'clock in my bed.

The fucked up part is I seemed to have functioned normally in the in between time. No one mentioned any abnormal behavior at work. I drove myself home, and actually made an appointment with a psychologist, so I must have known something was not right.

We're not sure yet if that is related to the depression, if it was just extreme exhaustion, or if it's something else physical. More tests coming.

<TEXT> 1. Often. I do not have a good diet, and never have. I'm trying to correct this but habitual behavior and budget tend to get in the way. Will be working on this in therapy.

1b. 330 with a 6'2 Frame. very overweight

2. I've been told I don't snore often. I am getting tests done in a few weeks to see if sleep apnea is a possibility. 

3. Yes. I am in my house roughly 10 hours of the day in total. 

4. Not as much as I'd like, I'm planning a big move in a few months and need to budget better than I have been, however I do treat myself from time to time.  </TEXT>

That being said, from my experience, those of my friends, and talking to counselors, the normal key things can be triggers, unusual amounts of stress, family problems, relationship problems etc, can all trigger what may have been under the surface for a while.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends on who you are seeing and if you have insurance. It's a specialized field so it can be pricey, but some practices are more willing to work with you than others. If you have insurance, find out if it covers mental and who is in your network. If not, start looking around. I go to a baptist behavioral health clinic. Those bigger clinics will be more able to help with prices than private practice in my experience.  </TEXT>

Honestly the stereotypical emo description really works best. It's like you're walking down a long dark tunnel with water up to about mid-shin. It's cold, clammy, uncomfortable at all times and all you want to do is just lay down and not feel that anymore. After a while, that becomes your reality and the cold clamminess almost supplants the concept of the warm blanket. It's almost comfortable.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It has cost me jobs in the past simply by me being too apathetic to get out and look, but at the moment, and I can't believe I'm saying this, I'm luckily broke as shit. I say that because I have two roomates and a dog depending on me, so even when I don't give a shit about taking care of myself, I'm beholden to them so I can drag myself up. 

But yes on a regular basis I cannot bring myself to do what should be basic tasks like getting up and going to class. I take 3 classes a week, I'm in my last semester, and when things were at their worst this year I was missing weeks at a time. 

The exhaustion may be linked to the depression mixed with working a full time job and commuting to school. I'm glad to only have 1 more month of this.  </TEXT>

The problem with Prozac is there can be side effects including the little general going permanently awol that may need to be taken care of with other meds, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there.

If I hit a wall with the Prozac, we'll look at moving me on to a more expensive cocktail of drugs but hopefully it won't come to that. Prozac is cheap and effective.  </TEXT>

The thing with any mental health profession that most people don't realize is that a lot of it we still don't understand. We know what does and doesn't work in terms of treatment, but the why of it all, (i.e. why does the chemical imbalance start, why do certain medicines work) is still all in the very hypothetical at this point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's fairly constant. The way my psychiatrist put it is, we all have good days and bad, but we mostly live at an emotional normal. A center line if you want to look at it like a graph. I'm constantly in the lower hemisphere of that and rarely if ever reach another persons emotional norm.

Put it another day. When an average person comes home after a long day; not necessarily terrible but not great either, and they're tired, somewhat fed up, and just want to lay down and rest? That's the happiest I feel with any amount of consistency. 

The depression itself I would say is worse because I have a fairly good support system that helps get me through. The worst thing though is feelings of complete helpless loneliness. I live with a roommate and their SO. They do what they can, but there's still a puzzle piece missing that neither can provide. At least not without causing a much larger amount of drama than it's worth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A couple of minor things here and there, increased lethargy, ambivalence. The major one though was a few weeks ago I lost 10 hours. I work in a place where my day is split between two sites. I work in one for 7 hours, and another across the street for the last two. A few weeks ago I was gathering my things to leave at 7, and then woke up at 5 o'clock in my bed.

The fucked up part is I seemed to have functioned normally in the in between time. No one mentioned any abnormal behavior at work. I drove myself home, and actually made an appointment with a psychologist, so I must have known something was not right. 

We're not sure yet if that is related to the depression, if it was just extreme exhaustion, or if it's something else physical. More tests coming. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's esentially when you have dysthmia mixed with a major depressive disorder. 

Dysthymia is the more common thing that most people will get at some point in their lives. It's minor and usually non recurring, but when it does recur, it can be overwhelming and crippling. When people say they feel trapped and can never feel happy, that's usually recurring Dysthymia. 

Double depression takes that and combines it with a major depressive disorder. Which has a quicker onset and greater initial impact. So when you mix the two together, it's like taking on someone else's heavy camping backpack while you're already lugging two armfuls of your own shit up a hill. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ok, so after flashpoint, I get the how what and why of the new u, and I'm enjoying the non justice league titles. My question however is almost all of the titles seem to be reboots showing the heroes close to the beginning of their careers, which is fine and I get. However, it states that supers have only been around for a few years and based on today's releases, batmans gone through 3 robins and is on his 4th who is his 11 year old son; and the events of killing joke, rip, the year be was dead, return of bw, and batman Inc have clearly all happened, as have the lantern Corp wars.

Is there something I'm missing as to why everyone but bats and lanterns is just starting out, is everyone else lost but an explanation should be coming, or is this "because fuck you I'm grant fucking Morrison that's why?"

Edit: I understand this is not proper reddiquette but who the hell downvoted this? I was literally just asking a question I was confused about. How are there three people who though "there's something he doesn't completely comprehend and needs clarification on... NOOO!"

I understand if this is even read again that i'll get slammed for this but original three downvoters, wtf? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Very long bad relationship had ended recently and I was interested in pursuing a mutual friend. Before I go on I should clarify that I have clinical depression and very low self worth, which i know is fairly every day for reddit, but it pertains to the story. My default assumption is that everyone hates me. I'm not overstating that, the only people I know 100% of the time that love me are my parents. 

So when I say that it was a big, hard deal asking her out, understand that it was a big, hard deal asking her out. 

But she said yes! I have never been so elated in my life. Even the previous relationship didn't start off with me asking the girl out and her saying yes. So we talked for a few weeks, planning and trying to make the schedule work but nothing ever happened. Things kept coming up. We eventual grew apart over some differences of opinion between my ex and ex's current bf.
On a later phone call with ex, she told me that the girl never liked me, and only said yes because she was scared of me and what I might do if I said no, (my depression was undiagnosed at the time and this was high school so any abnormal emotional reaction meant you were 2 steps away from bringing in a rifle.)

tl;dr My ex informed me a new romantic interest only agreed to go out with me because she was scared of me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dell. Fuck everything about them. Two inspiron laptops died within a year of each other. When I sent the first laptop in, it took them 3 months to get it diagnosed and replaced and that was only after me calling and complaining multiple times. Then they were so mind fuckingly incompetent that they "fixed" the old laptop and sent it back to me. I use the quotes because I gave that to my mom and it died within a month.

Never again.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This one is a long shot but if I'm ever going to find it, you guys'll do it. Since I can remember, my father's been telling me about a book he once read that had his favorite one liner ever in it. A detective or a cop walks into an ME's office and says
"Well, is it murder?"
and the ME Responds
"Either that or the most thorough suicide I've ever seen"

Google, book stores, and librarians have failed me. I know it's a long shot but does anyone recognize this line and know what book it's from. It'd make a really great Fathers day gift for him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You have no reason to care about me or my life and if you aren't in the mood for a long read, by all means skip this one because there won't be a tldr.
Reddit, I don't get it. I suffer from depression, and have for a long long time, though it was only diagnosed a few months ago. But even with that knowledge, there's still so much I don't understand.
A lot of my issues stem from lonlines, which I'm sure is shocking coming from a guy on the internet at 3am. However, I can't figure out what I'm missing. I'm relatively smart, have the ability to make people laugh, I'm overweight but haven't quite passed into ugly. What's the secret ingrediant to finding people that I missed? Did they teach it in school one day that I was sick. I'm not talking about a wife or my soul mate, that will come when it comes, I'm talking about a woman who can spend time with me and say you are worth spending more time with/on. Again I'm not asking for the rest of my life, but I see women all the time in these long term relationships with absolutely retched people, it makes me insane. It's a running joke with my friends that my life is a sitcom but it really is full of stereotypical bullshit that I just don't know how to get past or get around.
Which leads to my other point. The loneliness is saddening and crushing and I don't know why. The fact of the matter is things happen at different times for different people and I know I'll find someone eventually, but it's been twenty two years and while I know that mentally, emotionally it's just like this gorge of sadness and desperation that I can't seem to cross. 22 years and not one girl has ever thought to say yes or ask me out on a date.
I can't figure out how to get past this or why I need to. My time is coming, I know this. I'm smart, funny, cuteish, and can write fairly well, I know it will get there. But till then there's nights like tonight. Stumbling across pictures of the "almost had it" and just sliding down the walls, and I just don't know why.
If you read this, thank you for your time, it means the world. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you, I really appreciate the sentiment.The small difference is that I have an a-typically presenting depressive disorder, I find and recognize joy in every day life, but then if a downswing hits I can think on those fondly, but not truly happily. 

If we go back to the gorge metaphor, if I slide down a wall a little bit, I can stop and enjoy the foliage growing on that wall, and even scoot back up a bit, until sliding down a bit further. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I was just screwed by my colleges financial aid tacking on an extra semester to school, meaning that I'm going to have to pay an extra 7000 dollars to graduate which may mean more loans as most of my scholarships expire after year four.
I desperately need a job, even more so now that I zerod out my bank account to get my car towed and looked at to determine that the timing belt I had replaced six months ago snapped again, and I don't have money to fix it. But if you don't have reliable transportation, most companies are turning you down out of hand.
My mentor through college is getting laid off because the head of our department is a jelous territorial cunt who can't stand that my mentor is more talented and well liked than her. This is causing major stress in terms of finding work and is severely damaging her marriage to a guy who has become one of my closest friends.
I also recently found out that my grandfather is dying of colon cancer and while he still should have a few good months, probably won't live to see me graduate college, which he would have if this snafu hadn't happened and I was walking in two weeks.
No entertaining stories but I could use a pick me up. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I want to start a conversation about the Penny Arcade controversy from the last month. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Please please please please keep this reasoned and cool headed. I just want an actual discussion and finding out what other people think about the dickwolves controversy from the last few months.

How I view things right now.

It was a joke. An off color joke that wasn't meant to offend but was inevitably going to. If you go back and read the original script, it was a commentary on "heroic" gaming culture and there is no conceivable way that it can be read as supporting rape. 

That being said, they could have handled the fallout better. They shouldn't have apologize, nor should they have been asked to, and the follow up comic about the matter was perfect. However, pressing the issue just to press it with the t shirt and all of that was not necessary and shouldn't have been done. 

When it comes down to it it was a joke, a joke I personally laughed at, and I have had rape touch my life in multiple incidents. If you were offended by it, then I'm sorry but sometimes people are going to make jokes that are going to offend you and that doesn't mean that they are advocating the position that did the offending. 

For those saying this issue is done with, what spawned me writing this was going through the back catalog and researching their development for inspiration and I came across timelines and opinion pieces, it's very much not dead.

Just wanted some other people's thoughts and opinions on the issue. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I grew up in the south, so there were a lot of rednecks and bullies. The rednecks who would throw out hateful speech left and right and assume you would agree with them, and the bullies who strutted around the place thinking they were top shit when you knew how sad they really were but also knew how readily and totally they could fuck your shit up so you just steered clear and had a begrudging respect for them even if you didn't agree with them.

In 8th grade the rednecks and bullies started feuding at it was the most wonderful piece of MADD come to life I've ever seen. Many people from both groups were expelled.

I wanted this to be like that... I'm sad now.
