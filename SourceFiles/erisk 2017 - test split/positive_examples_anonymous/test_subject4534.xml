<TITLE> iPad mini was stolen </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-07 01:35:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My iPad mini 3 was stolen. I reported it stolen. Had the sim card suspended. I have Find My iPhone turned on and put it in Lost Mode. It has a lock screen. I have restrictions set so no one can make changes unless they know the password.

But since I found out it was stolen I've checked Find My iPhone and it's been offline. I've checked the notify me but so far, nothing. It's only been two days.

The thing is I'm not sure if they were able to restore it somehow. I usually customize the names of my devices but this iPad is just listed as 'iPad' which is odd. I might have forgotten to rename it when I reset everything a few months ago. I'm just wondering if there is any way possible they could have restored the iPad mini which could result in the name change and the offline status? </TEXT>

<TITLE> A second cat? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-23 20:23:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a 2 year old cat and I'm thinking of getting a second cat. I think my cat is lonely when I'm not home, he seems to sulk whenever I leave. I think he could use a companion. But I'm wondering if it's the right decision.

Some things I'm concerned about:

- I travel every few months to visit family either by 16 hour road trip or by flying. Traveling with two cats is doable but does complicate things. 
- I would be committing to another cat for his or her lifetime. Though a companion would be great for my cat, my cat doesn't have to worry about vet bills, moving, etc.
- I'm moving from a 3 level townhouse to a 2 bedroom apartment in a few months
- I'm starting College in the fall so the cats will be alone for a better part of the day, the pros are that my college will be across the street from my new apartment

Otherwise my cat isn't affectionate but does love humans and their presence as well as their attention. He's playful but not very creative. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My trainer came up with a routine I can do while I'm traveling and don't have access to a gym. One of them is titled as a dumbbell burpee and the instructions are to row on each arm, push up, and then lunge on each leg. 

I don't remember doing this since I was super tired the day we went through this workout. I'd rather not bother my trainer at this time since its late. 

Anyone know what exercise this is? I'm at a loss of exactly how I should be performing it. Google isn't any help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was raised Roman Catholic and couldn't imagine leaving the Church behind or renouncing my faith. I'm more Catholic in tradition than practice (but still attend Church occasionally, etc.). My family are just Catholic, that's just the way it is. I've reconciled my faith with my sexuality over time. When I was a teenager I believed it to be a sin. Now, I just believe Mark 12:30-31; I believe in loving God with all my heart, and loving my neighbours as I love myself. And oddly enough, I think of the Miranda Lambert song "Heart Like Mine"  where she sings: Jesus, "He would understand a heart like mine". I think if I try to be a good person, go to Church, be charitable, and kind to others, than that's all that really matters. In the end, Jesus will be my judge, not man. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My brother played Eminem's "Headlights" a few weeks ago. I'm not a fan of rap but my brother is a big Eminem fan so I'm familiar with the story of Eminem's relationship with his mother and that song honestly made me start crying.

But I think it would be 4 Non Blondes "What's Up" at 14. I heard it and that's when I knew music wasn't something you just consume but could mean so much more. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just bought the Sennheiser HD558s. I like them enough but I can't help but feel they're just a taste of what I'm looking for. A start pretty much. I want headphones that make it sound like I'm right there, right in the room. The 558s still feel like I'm listening through headphones. Any cheap set ups for someone just starting out? I listen to mostly country. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm Native and yes it is. I have a lot of alcoholics in my family. My parents stopped drinking when I was a kid and I'm glad they did because our home life was great compared to others. Education sucks in native communities, poor healthcare, poor housing, little jobs, and residential school really messed up the older generations who then became poor parents to their kids who then became poor parents to their kids. But the new generation is getting slowly better. I see more young people who are breaking the cycle of family addiction who lead healthy lives. I didn't drink until I was in my 20s because of all alcoholism I saw in my hometown. People who get blackout drunk and become violent. But after years of living away from that I felt it was okay to try a beer and now I would consider myself a social drinker, 1-2 drinks tops and I'm done and switching to water. I'm very aware of the stereotype so I try not to get too drunk. </TEXT>

**Source** - iPod classic, Macbook Pro  
**Isolation** - Doesn't matter  
**Preferred Type** - Over the ear. Or in the ear.  
**Tonal Balance** - I'm not sure.. I don't like too much bass. I like to hear everything.  
**Past headphones** - $20 Sony earbuds that get worse over time and sound muddy now. Sennheiser earbuds that were stolen so I don't remember what they sounded like. I also have Denon AH-D7000s and I find those underwhelming but they're meant for my record player not my iPod.  
**Preferred Music** - Country, country rock, indie rock/pop. I could be listening to anything from acoustic country, country with rock guitars, or lo-fi like The Wavves and then to something like Lorde or Florence and the Machine.  

The store I'm going to carries Sennheiser, AKGs, Audio-Technica, Monster, Bose, Sony and Panasonic. So preferably in those brands. </TEXT>

He saw me shopping one day on vacation and decided he had to get to know me so while I was standing around he chatted me up. We became instant friends before I went back home. For some reason he became fascinated with where I came from and made the 16 hour drive to my hometown and stayed a week in a tent behind my parents house and got to know my town and my family. He says its one of the best trips he's made. He's actually the first and only person to ever mention how beautiful my dark brown eyes were. Everyone is quick to compliment blue/green/etc but rarely brown so I was pleasantly surprised. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had two jobs where I was under qualified. The first one was when I was 21 maybe and it was as an onsite administrator assistant. It was a small company and I felt they really really did not need an assistant because I had nothing to do all day. I also had no idea what I was supposed to be doing.

Then there was the summer job I had recently. I was a coordinator of sorts. I was in charge of a dozen people from 9-5 and my job was to supervise them but also coordinate their training program. I had to make up their schedule and hire people to train them. I think 50% of the the job was knowing the right people and networking. I didn't know the right people and I had to learn quickly how to network. It was very stressful and has honestly led to my recent depression. Though I felt I could have done a thousand times better in so many ways my bosses are happy with my work so I guess it wasn't all bad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He's probably in his 80s. Drinks a lot. I hear he's sober now which is surprising. But before he used to drink with his alcoholic friends on his porch and yell obscenities to the women walking by. He also passed out with a pan on his hot stove that caused a lot of smoke. He was fine and so was his house. My town gets some sick entertainment whenever they hear firetruck sirens 'cos the town is otherwise dead and nothing is going on. So quite the crowd. For awhile he didn't have proper sanitation and I'm pretty sure he used a honey bucket lined with garbage bags because those garbage bags he left for the town's garbage collectors to pick up was pretty squishy. My dad calls him the world's best neighbour. 

He did help me though when I was taking my dog out on a walk. My town lets their dogs run loose if they're not tied up year round. I make sure mine are collared and leashed when I take them out. Well a vicious dog was too interested in my dog and they were both getting aggressive with each other. World's best neighbour came to my rescue and scared the other dog off with a few rocks and kicks when I was struggling to keep my own dog in check while scaring away the other dog. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I live in a townhouse that has a shared fenced courtyard. I recently adopted a cat and he's settled into his new home. I've started taking him out everyday with a harness and leash. At first he was scared but now seems to look forward to his daily outing into the courtyard. I just follow him wherever he goes and if he's up for it I'll play with him with one of his toys. But I've noticed that my neighbour lets her cat out everyday too. The cats notice each other but don't walk up to each other and if my cats becomes too interested in the other cat I pick him up and distract him with something else. My parents have a small dog that tries to pick fights with other dogs so I have a bad experience of introducing dogs to each other. I'm wondering if it'll be the same with my cat? Is it okay if my cat wanders towards the neighbours cat and say hello? Honestly, I just want my cat to have a playmate, he likes his new home but he's very playful and at times seems lonely. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually had this conversation with a friend of mine. I told him didn't exactly have standards but was looking for someone who shared my values. Someone who believes in God, is a moderate Liberal and has strong family values since I do love kids and would love to have a big family one day. But I think I would also like someone who plays video games (BF4, Skyrim), doesn't mind me dragging them to the latest romcoms, and laughs at my dry-ish humour, and someone who has shelf full of books. I really don't like people who smoke or smoke up and prefer someone who is a social drinker who doesn't become dramatic once they've had a drink. Also, I'm fairly spoiled since I'm the youngest girl in my family, so someone who can accept that about me and doesn't make me feel guilty about it.

As a kid the plans my parents would make was always a 50/50 of whether or not they followed through so I've learned to just roll with things. I don't make plans. If something happens, then I just go with it. I'm always surprised at how emotional people can get and how stressed out they can be. I started thinking people would find my calmness very odd so now I try to "show" more of a emotional reaction when really I'm pretty calm. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is it not common practice to clean your place before going on vacation? When I started living on my own I made it a habit of cleaning my entire place whenever I would be out of town. I really don't like the idea of coming home to dirty sheets, dishes in the sink, and garage in the garbage bin that's been sitting there for awhile. Even now that I have a roommate who will be home I always make sure to clean the entire place before I leave. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Last year I took a year off of school and stayed with my parents. I was probably unemployed for like six months while I was there before I got a job. My parents travelled a lot so I took care of their two dogs, the house, and helped with both of brother's kids whenever they needed a babysitter or needed someone to drop off/pick up the kids from school. It sucked. I was bored out of my mind. I spent my days taking the dogs for walks, visiting my grandma who lived down the street, and cleaning the house. A lot of internet surfing and watching movies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As someone from a small town who loves country music, the whole "I'm so country" is wearing thin. My hometown is traditionally hunter-gatherer so no farms, ranches or horses. It's just hunting and harvesting. The people who live that life don't talk about it and post it on facebook because it's just life to them. It's no big deal that they split logs, put down fish nets, and set up traps and travel hundreds of kilometers to catch bigger game while holding down jobs to take care of their family. They're not tailgating, having bonfires, drinking beer from a dixie cup, or posing with their guns for facebook. That boat they own has a purpose and so does that snowmobile, it's to get them to their nets or traps and to travel long distances over water or land for bigger game. And that truck they have is to transport the cords of wood they cut to either heat their homes or in the summer cook their food over a firepit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My hometown is completely surrounded by wild untouched land that goes on for what seems like forever. If you're going camping it's a lot of portaging, a lot of carrying packs, and a lot of paddling for hours on end. If you bring an iPhone, iPad, or iPod you better protect it! My mom dropped her iPhone in the lake one time. My dad was smarter and put it in a waterproof case. But neither of us brought any kind of chargers. After a long day of paddling/portaging in the hot sun, it's nice to relax in your tent and listen to some music, play a game, or watch a video. Then it dies and you still have a few days to reach your destination. I plan on taking my oldest nephew on our next camping trip and I'm sure as hell getting him a charger so he can play his iPad games during our downtime. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I sometimes think it's cultural and maybe a little bit biological. My dad is shy as well as my sister and me. My adopted siblings are not shy and neither is my mom. I was shy because I was incredibly self aware and that made me very self conscious. I had a happy childhood and was never bullied. Kids were always nice to me. I was sheltered a lot too. My dad and my sister learned to cope with their shyness by creating public personas but they're still very much introverts. I didn't create a public persona for myself but I learned to control my shyness after years of practice because I was tired of being shy. I'm still introverted though. It took years of practice, years of awkward moments, stilted conversation, and trial and error to learn to cope with my shyness and make friends for the first time ever. Dealing with my shyness is still an ongoing process.

I do think shyness is related to a fear of rejection. When I'm struggling with my shyness and force myself to be confident, I feel a sense of fear and if I feel I'm "rejected", it fucking hurts. But I think "fuck it," life is too short. I heal that rejection and move on.

I also think it's cultural because my old hometown was a very shy town. The people were just shy towards outsiders unless the outsider goes out of their way to be friendly, then they're accepted into the fold. But the new generation is not like this. They're very outgoing, friendly, and eager to experience new things. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not sure if it's a sixth sense and not sure if it's at all impressive since it requires close proximity but I can sense when someone is close to me. When I was a kid my siblings found it amusing though. They would stand behind me and then let their hands hover over my back and I would feel this weird tingling feeling over the exact spot. It's come in handy though. My family is all fairly close and relatives are often visiting each other at all hours of the day/night. When I was in my early teens, I went to bed early because it was a school night. I left my door open because I was terrified of evil spirits and ghosts and felt safer with the door open. I fell asleep. Then I woke up. My right thigh was tingling. I shot up and there was my male cousin crouched beside my bed with his hand hovering over my leg. He told me he just wanted to ask if I had any CD-Rs. I told him I didn't and he left. Turns out, he'd been groping female relatives while they slept. He grew out of it but the family has kind of ... ostracized him since. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was living with my sister, we had our first fire drill in our apartment. I ran out the door and went downstairs to the lobby. My sister followed right behind me with her wallet, our cat, and her cell phone. Nowadays I'd probably just grab the kids and dogs and leave. I can't remember where I ever leave my wallet or cellphone so screw looking for it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Family recommended the show to me because it was funny. I watched an episode and couldn't watch anymore. It came off scripted. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I watched Glee for awhile so I can say the only episode I liked was the very first one. It all went downhill from there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I sent a text message to the wrong number. I inverted the last two digits. I thought I was texting my brother in law. He was with my sister when her phone died so I joked that I was stalking her. The text receiver didn't appreciate the joke. Turns out a girl he knew shared the same name as my sister. I explained myself and apologized. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me, the most useful info is that drowning is silent and isn't the flailing around and shouting you see in movies/TV. My nieces and nephews love swimming and our beach doesn't have a lifeguard. Someone drowned there recently. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That sucks. My mom forgot her iPhone in a public restroom. Mine was stolen when I forgot it in a bookstore, so my mom was happy a cleaning lady found hers. Since those things cost about $700, my mom gave her $40 for finding it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Had one drink at 18. Didn't drink alcohol for years afterwards. Family has a few recovering alcoholics so I just didn't see a point to drinking. First time I got drunk was on my sisters birthday. Made sure to drink a lot of water. Stopped drinking when I felt myself losing my ability to walk straight. Growing up shy and self aware has only made me very aware of how drunk I am. Tipped the waitress alot but I do that sober too. </TEXT>
