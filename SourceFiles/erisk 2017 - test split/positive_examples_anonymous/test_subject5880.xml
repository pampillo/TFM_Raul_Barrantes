<TEXT> Vape Dojo, eh? Nice to see you still around here. 

I have a question for you. Last night I found myself having a full body craving for Zen Juice - the first Eliquid I've ever had. 

The question is, do I buy all the Zen juice you've ever created, or no? 

Edit: I just bought a lot of Zen Juice anyway. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my eyes, it's still a really, really great device. While I've stopped recommending it to others as I don't feel comfortable giving them something they'd have to fix, I'm confident in my ability to do so. I don't regret the purchase at all and I don't want to return it. I really enjoy this device. 

However if I had to do it over, I'd plug up the screw on the top of the device closest to the firing button, and I'd insulate the space between the sliding plastic window and the black iStick enclosure - either saran wrapping it to keep liquid out or something else creative.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A user on here seems to think it's about a T6 if that helps.

However, I had your same exact problem. If you need a vape right away and don't have the Torx, here's a couple of workarounds that got me through. 

This isn't going to sound serious, but in all reality, I banged it onto my leather steering wheel a few times right below the button to try to force the button mechanism out. Worked fantastically. 

Another thing that worked was unscrewing the atomizer, screwing another one one, and screwing back in the old one. 

However when you get the Torx drivers, check out this fix I posted today.

The only time I wouldn't present a chemical to a vape is if I believed it were to have the chance of heating up and me inhaling the fumes. However I'm sure that isn't really a hot spot. 

 hell if you really wanted to, you could put some saran wrap under the center sliding plastic window and out over the walls it slides into, and then cut off the excess.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're not ignorant at all :). However I have seen just a small few people talk about their 30w's autofiring. I've seen way more 50w posts, however. The 50w was also the hottest product on the market at the time, so that could also account for the difference in amount of posts.

I wouldn't stress about it. When the iSticks started autofiring, people really, *really* lost their cool very fast.

When I saw the issue, I just kept doing what I was doing - turn your iStick off when you're not using it. In addition to that, I started sometimes taking off the atomizer if I was going to leave it sit in my hot car during work. That way there is nothing for the iStick to fire.

I had an autofiring iStick, yet I still made use of it for a week, since I really wasn't feeling my mech mod setup. As long as you just unscrew the atomizer as it's autofiring, you're still in control of the device. 

I don't know much about the VT60! What I can recommend doing to learn a bit about it is to punch it into the search engine for /r/electronic_cigarette. Try punching in VT60 autofire, or various other google-fu terms. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Holy shit, dude. I have no clue.

The only thing I could think of is melted glue - as none of that is supposed to bend. The chip is stuck to the batteries and the batteries are stuck flat to the chip. That's some f'd up gore, though, man.

While mine didn't autofire past the 10 second limiter (so far that I've seen), I have seen some that have. Maybe it's possible that this thing fired all night, and the batteries got so hot that it just melted shit up?

If you wanted to check whether or not it was actually the batteries that were an issue, you'd have to peel back or cut through the insulation on both terminals of the battery so that you could put the leads of a multimeter on there. If the battery were to be around 0 volts, that *could* be the reason it won't take a charge, as 18650's won't charge after they stoop down to a certain voltage. However it could also be a faulty chip in that situation. However if the batteries were to be around 3-4v, you know that you've got a chip issue.

I'd ask /r/openpv. I'm not by any sense a master of electronics. I just happened to find a fix for one of the many issues with this device :\. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a thought provoking idea.

How would you charge it? You couldn't just really wrap the sides, you'd need a full enclosure.

I once saw a tablet on the front page that had a battery vent overnight and the tablet actually burst, showing a full charging bag looking thing. It was pretty interesting. 

I think the issue is that when a battery vents, it lets off so much gas. You'd need that material to have a lot of space to move or it will burst   cause an explosion. I have a charging bag, and it is made to still release gas, but just not flame. </TEXT>

It is mainly due to [this issue I had with them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2m5km4/horrible_customer_experience_with_eciggity/)

It is also due to the issues felt by many of those who participated in their Black Friday sale. Many orders were charged upwards of 8 times, totaling over $1000. Here's [one case](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2nowen/eciggity_ruined_my_weekend/), [another](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2o6yo1/eciggity_charges_have_finalized_no_refund/), [another](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2o28ww/anyone_got_any_money_back_from_eciggity_yet/), and [another](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2p4952/continue_to_be_disappointed_with_eciggity/)

It's also because I feel that they participate in vote manipulation on reddit, both on comments made by their official account and on posts relative to their company. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't have the veritas long enough to determine whether or not it was a product I loved - I just know that it never leaked on me and that's my biggest priority.

I've always just brushed off the hardness of building (which is why I own a fogger, the hardest thing in the world to build). However I would like something easier to build, which is why I'm totally into the idea of the Marquis.

However I never had to build my dual coils with only one wire on there! I was able to use two. I can dig up a picture of my build if you're interested.

Edit: I stumbled across my only build image. It's not too helpful anyways, but I still love the color of that 'Nana Cream. http://i.imgur.com/EAEdSlU.jpg </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is super interesting. Thank you for posting this here.

It's very possible that this might not be a forever fix. While jiggling around the button - it does seem to be a piece of shit. However he does attribute humidity to being a possible cause for the button not working - and this should solve the humidity/wetness problem. I still think that the reason the button sticks inside is due to eliquid getting in there.

It was a fix for me, but there is a whole variety of issues some people have with the 50w that this sadly might not fix. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What's up ECR.

I know we had a pretty long period of everyone's homes being destroyed by iStick 50ws. I was confident that my home would remain safe, however my iStick 50w too fell victim to autofiring. 

However I didn't toss her, as I'm poor and cheap - I instead decided to take her apart, have some looks, and see if I could locate a problem. I did this about 2-3 weeks ago, and waited to see if any problem has returned, and I'm happy to say that I have had no further issues at all.

The issues I were having with the iStick 50w came on very suddenly. I was getting high one day, and the dog knocked over my iStick and it leaked liquid all up onto itself, and upon grabbing it a while later, I noticed the firing button would not work. I could adjust the wattage, but I could not fire the device or turn it off.

I later found out that this was because the firing button was stuck on. As I drove into work the next morning, the device actually began to autofire in my hand. I just unscrewed the atomizer, used a buddies vape for the day, and used the device on/off for about a week before deciding to do something about it - as there are no other products on the market that I'm really interested in right now.

So here's a little treat for all of those who didn't throw out their iSticks instantaneously :) - hopefully it'll stop your house from burning down.

Here's a shoutout to /u/ddo405 who tracked me down a few days ago looking to see if my fix was successful. It took me a little bit, as work has been hectic, but I put something together for ya. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm pretty bummed out. I haven't been in a strong relationship for quite a while. I sadly can't even remember when it was, as I got heavy into benzodiazepines toward the last half of our ~14 month relationship, and I really wiped out a lot of my memory for that ~6 month period. I got cheated on, again, by a beautiful woman I was living with. I think its been maybe 2 years since then, but I haven't been able to commit to anyone since.

I'm trying to get back into the game. There was a girl this semester in college I was obsessed with, but it didn't take off. My old friend with benefits who I haven't seen in quite some time said she wanted to get down on Wednesday and I got so fucking excited, and then she called it off. Two nights ago I just got the number of this adorable girl I work with, and we had a date set up for tomorrow, and just now she canceled. 

It's like, I just want a partner to be by my side. I've been diagnosed major depressive with a side of a severe anxiety disorder. In the end of 2013 I went through the hospital system, and early 2014 I did months of therapy, but since the end of 2014/beginning of 2015 I've been really trying to climb above it and feel normal, and mostly succeeding at doing so. I've been working out, getting out, doing fun things, but in these last months its like nobody around me is down for the count. I really struggle to find people to do things with anymore. Although I was there to support all of them at their lowest, none of them turn around to just spend some time - so I'm stuck at home with my depression, getting high and/or drinking, when I'm not bold enough to go out and try to have fun solo.

When I was in that committed relationship, with that partner, we'd do everything together - spend every moment with each other, and never tire of each other. I'd have someone to talk to on long hikes, someone to go cruise beautiful roads and hang around lakes with to just watch the damn sunset and feel alive - but lately I feel that I've got none of that. I get my hopes up so much when I get the slightest indication that things are really starting to look up - that someone is taking an interest in me and I might get a new friend or special someone, but I feel like I keep getting let down again and again. I don't know what it is, but it's got me sad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a similar thing happen to me this semester at college. There was a girl that I was super obsessed with. I tried to move my way closer to her slowly, and I think we decently hit it off, however the opportunity to get her number never really presented itself.

In my freshman year of high school, I dated my best friends sister. While me and that friend are still great friends, I can not recommend the dating of the sister.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Congratulations on becoming one step closer to healing. Learning more about yourself is always a great step to make.

The hospital can be a frightening environment, but it is also where I learned some of the most important things I'll ever learn in my lifetime. Don't expect yourself to be fixed as soon as you leave the hospital, but do realize that you will have the tools to much better deal with the problems you encounter in life - and that really makes all the difference. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It changes all the time! I'm into anything but country, but I have to admit that I dabble the most in electronic music. Dubstep is really my best friend (excision shambhala mixes) when I'm having a really controlled energetic mind late night high. Right now I'm spacing out to the metahuman album by eprom. 

Aside from tame impala, other great vibe artists have to be Rebelution for sure, pink floyd is always a given, and I've recently dropped back into Smash mouth ( sugar ray  everclear) as well -  more specifically their astro lounge album I had as a kid. 

Aside from that,  regular everyday music would range from Cake's Satan Is My Motor album, psychostick, tech n9ne,mac Lethal, Eminems old stuff, big chocolate (trap-ish music), Green day, and blink 182,   </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been using the reddit is fun app for quite some time, and have made the transition over to relay. The app is beautiful looking. The one thing that is really bugging me is that it is impossible to read through a really long thread. While scrolling, if I make the slightest sideways movement with my thumb, it exits the thread and takes me back to the front page. I've had to open this thread over 5 times and try to relocate the place I left off. 

Another issue I'm running into is that YouTube links will not open when the thumbnail is clicked (the internal browser doesn't work), but it will run the video in the YouTube app if I click on the title of the post. 

Overall, the app has a beautiful appearance, but some functionality issues are bugging me a bit.  </TEXT>

I took Welbutrin, and I noticed that while it did help my levels of motivation, that it murdered my appetite and increased my levels of anxiety. Usually with every anti-depressant, you're going to take it for 2 weeks and feel little to nothing (except I felt quite a bit of energy the first 2 days of welbutrin), and then around that 2 week mark is when you start feeling the changes your medication will bring. 

I can tell you that I took effexor for quite a long time, and while starting it (especially while leveling up doses), I couldn't even form sentences. My brain was just adjusting hardcore and I was totally just lost in a fog for a couple days. It went away quickly, though.

If what you're feeling persists for too long (a week, or less if you're real uncomfortable), talk to who prescribed it to ya. </TEXT>

Here's [Thank You - by Royksopp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLLbFDRG2zc)

Thank you,    
forever,    
for the things you've done...

Nothing    
could be better,    
than to say it...

Thank you,    
forever,    
for the things we are...

Nothing    
is so easy    
as they say it is...

So, thank you    
my brother    
for the things you've done...

Knowing    
you'll never walk away    
like I did,    
you know...

.

Thank you,    
forever,    
for the things we are...

Noone    
can see inside of me    
like you do...

Thank you,    
for the hours    
in the orange sky.

Brother,    
you will always be    
a part of me...

And thank you    
for the courage,    
when I go too far...

Knowing    
you'll never walk away,    
like I did...    
You know...

<TEXT> You're gonna make it. You're one of the very few people I see that knows they're depressed and **wants** to get help. That's really great to see.

If you feel that a stay in the hospital would be fitting for you, I'd advise to not shy away from it. While it was a hard experience, it gives a person the tools they need to really begin to start changing their life.

If you want to look into therapy, try out this awesome resource: https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/

Put in your zip, instantly get a lot of therapists around you - and you can sort by price per session (it shows what insurances they accept). I've personally gone with a therapist off there who offered $35 per session over the table, and it's one of the best choices I ever made.

That website allows you to send emails directly to each therapist, and in emailing 4 that I saw, I found that they all reply really quickly.

Just introduce yourself, and ask what their availability is like :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey there.

I feel you - I get what you're feeling. I just wanted to pop in and say that I'm feeling the same, even today. I'm a type of person that is always looking for music to comfort me in every situation, and for this situation I've got [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQ7hdF7Xyns), actually called "Why Won't They Talk To Me." If you're interested in music at all, have a listen. If you like it, that whole album (Called Lonerism) really reflects that same feeling of people around you just isolating you. A few tracks are sort of like - hey fuck them, I'm better off by myself anyways (Track: Solitude is Bliss.)

Best of luck, friend. I'm trying my best to start meeting new people, because while I feel that I'm always there for everyone around me - when it comes to me being down, no one is ever really there. It's a shitty feeling to have. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for knowing this. NJOY, known as Sottera at the time, was the first company to bring the electronic cigarette to the United States. They do have beginner setups and actual vials of Eliquid with fruity flavors. Never tried it, but I support them. I got one of their cigalikes and it of course tasted real bad, but it's the only cigalike I'll use if my setup breaks down.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> To add onto this, I believe you're having dry hits because of the massive amount of wick. Generally, in addition to having it pulled through the coil, you'll want as little cotton as possible. Because you've got quite a bit of wick, the liquid in the wick is all sitting elsewhere and not able to move very fast to the spot you're heating with the coil. 

My general rule of thumb when wicking is to put enough wick through the coil so it's not thin enough to slide through the coil on its own (without you pulling it), but it's not ever getting stuck in or choked by the coil (not difficult to pull through at all). 

Also, is your coil getting red hot while it's wicked? That shouldn't ever happen. Something is up there, too.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, so if fluid flows freely out of the end of the brake line, it's fine? Because my whole brake fluid reservoir emptied out this brake line :/. It's not possible that fluid goes out but not back in?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This would probably make the most sense out of anything anyone has told me all day. Thank you much. I've gotta look into where to buy brake lines. I've had real issues getting any sort of part for my car, because I don't know what's limited edition, and what's stock Mk4 GTI parts. This specific part of brake line costs $45 on ECS tuning, and while that's better than $232 for a caliper from them, I'm sure someone has it cheaper.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> 2003 VW Mk4 20thAE GTI - Brake Pads Stuck to Rotor, Caliper not Retracting </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-13 20:57:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A little under a month ago, I bought new rear rotors and pads for my Mk4 20AE GTI, as the drivers side pads had been worn down to the metal. **While trying to compress the drivers side caliper, I could not get it in all the way**, and I tried literally everything - [it only went this far (2nd image is passenger side for comparison](http://imgur.com/a/7Ephj).

**I removed the caliper** from the brake lines and the e-brake cable - completely off of the car. **I spun the piston, and it went straight in** and shot fluid out of the hole where the brake line connects.

I put it back on the car over the new rotors and pads, and me and a buddy **bled the caliper** (I was operating the pedal, I don't know if he for sure did it right, but he does work with cars at a dealership).

My **brake warning light came on** - flashing and beeping, but no ABS light or check engine light - no code to read. It was a similar warning as to if I were to take off driving with the e-brake pulled, however the brake light was not solid on as it is when the e-brake level is pulled. 

Brakes were squishy on and off, but me and my buddy ended up pretty much bleeding out all of the squishyness and adding a bit of fluid (with where my reservoir is positioned, it's impossible to see the gauge   tell how much fluid to add, but it's not empty). Still had the same warning.

Decided to take it for a drive to see if it would get me to work tomorrow. I drove about 4 miles (brake warning light on intermittently), and as soon as I opened my door, I could smell it - the heat coming from the pads and the rotor on that side. I put my hand in front of the rim, and all of the surrounding air was hot as hell. **Its as if the pads are sticking to the rotor - like the brake caliper is pushing out onto the pads, but not retracting back into the caliper**. I have no idea what could possibly cause this. 

We decided to try getting a new caliper, [but none of the calipers in any store around me fit my 20th AE GTI](http://imgur.com/nTAXogC). ECS Tuning has the caliper for $232, and the VW Dealership has the caliper (only 3 of them in the US) for $200. I'm hoping to be able to just rebuild this caliper or find one that I can afford, because that price tag is just stupid high.

I'm completely lost and I miss my GTI. Been driving a Ford for the last 3 weeks :(. I have no clue what could cause this, so any advice is much appreciated.

If I can supply any more information or images to make the situation more clear, just let me know. I do have the caliper off of the vehicle and the piston removed - however I have no clue what I'm looking at.

**TL;DR in bold**

[Here's some images of the two sets of threads I could see inside of the caliper.](http://imgur.com/a/LoOli) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the quick reply, man.

I know for sure that the handbrake lever in the car was down all the way, but I don't know for certain that something wasn't pulling the handbrake mechanism on the caliper, as I've made some adjustments in the way the cables connect to the lever (cables kept falling out of the bracket, couldn't get it tight, just duct tape wrapped them). I checked a couple times and it appeared to be in the correct spot, however I'm tempted to put the caliper back on and disconnect the e-brake line to see what that does, if anything.

I took the caliper apart and took some pictures of the two sets of threads I could see. They look pretty clean, not real screwed up from what I can see. I also went and tried to find any part numbers that were on the caliper - I didn't see anything apparent, however at the end of this album are all the engravings I could find.

That's good to know that the Audi TT has the same calipers. I will for sure look into that. </TEXT>

I'll check car-part.com, I hadn't heard of that before. So far Advance Auto, NAPA, and most other store websites haven't given me any luck.

It's weird that it still considered the fluid to be low in the reservoir, I definitely thought I had it filled enough. It'd be useful if anyone had an image of what "full" looks like in the reservoir, as I can't see  the side of my reservoir to look at the gauges. 

I did use the proper tool. I went and bought one of those cube tools and ground down two of the edges on the 4 prong side. I even attached that bitch to a powerdrill and sat at it for days, and while attached to the car it wouldn't go in that far.

I'm hoping to find out exactly what might be wrong with the caliper so that I could try to repair it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a real bummer, man. But think of it this way - you see now that she is shallow, and not compassionate. However, assume that she had the feelings she posted on her twitter, but instead she didn't express them. You two go on a date, she is there, but mentally still feels that. You become a couple, are together for a while, but still she has that disinterest, and at this point is wildly afraid to express it in fear of damaging you, so she cheats, and you find out, and it's 5x ad heartbreaking as that Twitter post. 

When a girl turns me down, it's a bummer, but it's a relief because I know that I don't have to be ultimately let down later on.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is inaccurate. 

Citation 135 points to the New York Times, which does talk briefly about the dementia they found by examining his brain tissue. However, they also talked quite a bit about depression, anxiety, paranoia, and self harm. This article does not say that the dementia was the reason he committed suicide, which is what you seem to be trying to find out. 

Citation 136 points to TMZ, which is the source that says that the dementia was a "critical factor, " however their source of that information is "someone connected to the Williams family." Not a doctor, not the person performing the autopsy, not a therapist, but this mystery person. 

 Sources connected with the Williams family tell TMZ ... Lewy Body Dementia was the "key factor" they believe drove him to kill himself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I may not know my physics correctly here, so take this with a grain of salt. 

I'd imagine that more loose/open/wide airflow would lead to less negative pressure. When my airflow is open, I do not get as great of flavor, nearly. For instance, I have an infinite clt v2 (don't ever buy one), and the flavor is not nearly as good as my fogger v4, however if I want better flavor from it, I close off the airflow, which in turn raises the heat of the air in the atomizer. 

With my fogger v4, it's hard to draw from - the airflow is tight, the atomizer chamber is small, and I get the greatest flavor I've tasted from it. I'd assume that being harder to draw, that there'd be more negative pressure in the atomizer? 

Maybe I'm completely wrong. Just wanted to see if I could assist.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I posted this because I believe their danger is getting way overhyped. Everyone on reddit was going absolutely crazy over the istick 50w before it came out. It was like THE best thing to hit the market and everyone **had** to get one. For a very long time, the istick series has been the top most recommended setup for beginners or for people to have as their next purchase/upgrade from an ego style battery. 

Now that everyone has one, people are having problems and it seems incredibly more widespread because... Everyone has one. My current hypothesis is that while it may "auto-fire" - that this won't happen if people simply turn the device off while they're not using it by clicking the fire button five times. This is the same thing everyone has had to do since someone had the grand idea of putting a flashlight battery in a metal tube - you have to lock the mech mod or it will fire in your insert area here. While mech mods have the ability to start fires and kill people if they are left unlocked, we still very widely accept them as a great product. However, the istick also has the capability of firing when left turned on (no one knows yet if this is just a specific batch eleaf put out), yet everyone is losing their fucking minds over the safety concerns of this product. Everyone is jumping on a bandwagon and telling everyone they know to throw the whole series of isticks in the garbage because they saw someone on reddit tell someone else to do the same. 

A theory that was talked about a month or so ago, is that because the button is directly under your tank, if your tank leaks Eliquid into the crevice of this button, the mechanism may stick. This is true with so many other devices out there. I take great care of my iStick, and I have yet to see a single problem, and I'm positive that as long as I keep it turned off (like my mech mod) when I'm not using it, and I keep the button clean, I'm still going to be able to love this awesome product. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't mean to say locked, I meant moreso turned off. I press the power button 5 times to turn the vape off every time after I'm using it, as the habit just carried over from having a daily mech mod. The locking function only locks the arrow keys that adjust voltage/wattage. 

Did you mean locked, or powered off?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No issues with mine. I think the whole issue is getting really exaggerated. All of ECR was fine with using a battery in a metal tube as long as you kept it locked. Now people are putting their 50ws in their backpacks without locking it and freaking out because they're firing without them pressing the button. I really hate /r/electronic_cigarette right now.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I started out rebuilding with kanger coils. It's excellent to start with. If you want to rebuild the whole coil, pull off the positive terminal pin on the bottom, as well as the insulator between it and the pin, and then just pull the coil and wick out. Then give all pieces a bath in some boiling distilled water, as this will clean the coil and rid of any wick left in the coil unit.  </TEXT>

Everyone raves about good products they have on here, and every day that I'm on here I see someone raving about how an order they placed got fulfilled and actually got to their doorstep. I don't know if I'd go as far as to say that just because they're raving happy about the istick that they're an eleaf rep.  </TEXT>

It is the only power source I've used since getting it, and I treat it like a baby. Hardly ever even sees my pocket, as my shitty dripper leaks everywhere. I carried over the habit from my mech mod of turning it off after each time I'm done using it. If you are worried about flames, buy lipo safety bag for under $20 online. No matter what vape I'm charging overnight, the first three charges are always in the bag.  if it's ever charging and I'm not home, it's in the bag.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm having an issue changing out brake pads and rotors on a 2003 20th Anniversary Mk4 GTI. On the driver side, after removing the caliper from the rotor, opening the brake fluid reservoir, and using a special tool (the traditional 3/8"drive cube with two edges ground down) to turn the caliper's piston clockwise, the piston only goes in about 3/4 of the way. [Here's an image of first the right side piston, and the left side piston compressed completely.](http://imgur.com/a/7Ephj)

Anyone know why the piston won't go in any farther? I can't fit it over my pads and rotors. I've even put the special tool on an electric drill and sat there for a couple minutes just free spinning the piston - however it doesn't go in any farther. 

I'm really screwed and out of a ride - hoping for some advice.  </TEXT>

Anyone know why the piston won't go in any farther? I can't fit it over my pads and rotors. I've even put the special tool on an electric drill and sat there for a couple minutes just free spinning the piston - however it doesn't go in any farther. 

I'm really screwed and out of a ride - hoping for some advice.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The issue is that you will sometimes be given dye packs. In something like a stack of 20s, there will be only 4 real bills - two on the front two on the back, and the rest are hollowed out and fit a hard unbending dye pack. These can be avoided by bending the centers of packs of bills. These dye packs are set off by a couple proximity triggers in the ceiling tiles above the doorway.  </TEXT>

It will come to you in time. Maybe therapy doesnt work at first. It all seems like a pile  of shit. When I went through therapy, I actually found that things got worse right before they started getting better than I've ever seen before,  and that was because I was forced to finally face all of the things in life that I buried so deep inside. Once you work through facing that, once you start to learn how to feel in control of yourself again, things will get better. It doesn't have to end like this, my friend.  </TEXT>

If you're going to go through with it, think of this. 24 more hours. What difference would it make? Say you give yourself just 24 more hours. You revisit this tomorrow, ask yourself if you still want to do it. If you do, it will be the same result as you taking your life tonight. But say maybe you don't - you might really find happiness again someday in the very near future.  </TEXT>

If not, man, I just really want to remind you that this is the biggest decision you can make in your lifetime, and that like every other big decision, sometimes you really want to take the time to educate yourself on both sides of it. 

Do you think you'd like to call your therapist? Maybe just tell her what's going on and how you're feeling, just to see what she might say?

<TEXT> well i mean, i wouldnt drive at the moment cause that would be just straight up dangerous to others, trying to kill myself, not others...

My friend, what if I pointed out that, by leaving, you will injure every person around you in a way that they will never be able to heal or recover from? 

Stay for the people around you. There may be people in your life who can't survive without you. A friend of mine who passed away from suicide criticized this - he said it was selfish for other people to tell him to stay for them, however this reason to be alive will change over time. You won't, for the rest of your life, live just to spare the ones around you from pain. One day you'll look back on this night in tears happy that you made it out alive. I'm not Bullshitting, either :), I've had that moment. It's a very real thing. You've got so much ahead of you, my friend. 

I tried to pass in the same way you're going about it right now. I don't recommend it. I'd like to ask, and hopefully you'll tell me, what medication it was that you picked up?

<TEXT> Nice account name. 

 yeah, man. It's a real bummer to see that a girl that small was taken advantage of. It's a real hard thing to grow up with, as it can both subconsciously and consciously effect every relationship you have from that point onward. Trust does not become a thing without time and proper help, and anxieties are high. 

Some people just really don't think about that too often.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with you.

I'm a vaper, and I have no problem with a business banning the use of electronic cigarettes indoors. The only problem is that when state law mandates that no one can use electronic cigarettes indoors, the stores who sell the product will no longer legally be able to offer people to try their products in-store before they buy them. That's the only issue I have with this ordeal. If someone tells me I can't do it in their shop - I will respect that. But if the law prevents vendors from making sales and from users being able to try before they buy, that's a bummer.

The increased taxation is the biggest bummer. Both Illinois and Washington have been fighting bills to prevent 90%+ taxation on not only e-liquids but the actual hardware vaporizers. Electronic cigarettes are not a tobacco product as much as nicotine gum is not a tobacco product. In addition, many people use e-liquid that contains no nicotine - however they will still be mandated to pay that heavy sales tax. It doesn't make sense :(. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've too taken Effexor - it's a hell of a drug!

I often think I should end things with him simply to spare him from me.

I don't recommend this. Once you've completed tapering and it's out of your system, you may regret that decision and it may be irreparable. Consider this: Maybe he's not tiring of you, and those thoughts only stem from insecurities that the tapering might have quite a bit of an effect on. Maybe you go to end it to spare him, but he was never tiring of you at all.

I'd say to let him decide to end it if he decides he's tiring of you - however I don't think that anyone worth having in your life will tire of you due to your depression. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-03-21 06:16:18 </DATE>

<TEXT> Here's a long but funny anxiety narrative. 

Although I used to go from relationship to relationship and get used here and cheated on there, the failure of my last relationship (and my longest at about a year and a half) motivated me to take some time to be alone and become more independent. I put up a wall around my heart, and I learned how to be comfortable by myself while working to mend my anxiety and depression both on my own and with some professional help. However, I've recently met this girl who I think I'm ready to chase after.

In my college math course, there is this girl who sits two tables in front of me - out of sociable range - and she is just stunningly gorgeous. However I spent weeks of class just stealing glances at her not knowing how to start up conversation. I realized that she started to worm her way into my mind quite a bit even outside of class. My buddy who sits next to me in class (who probably became annoyed with me talking about her so much) kept pushing me to just approach her and get her number, but those with anxiety know that you have to wait for the perfect timing - even if it doesn't ever come.

However on Thursday, I noticed that she began to start turning around quite a bit more to glance at me during class as well. After that, I noticed that she overheard a joke I made, laughed at it, and turned around to add on to the joke, and we both laughed together. 

At the end of the class that day, we were working on an impossible group quiz. Me and my buddy were still working on it way past the end of class, as was she with her 6 person group. I didn't think by any means that I would have figured out the answer to the question the whole class was stuck on, but I managed to, and got up to turn my quiz in and dip out for the day - however, I first stopped over by her group to see if they wanted to copy my answers. 

She was immediately thankful, as was the whole group, however she then told me that I was, "like the nicest person ever." At that point she got up out of her chair and looked me right in the eyes. The connection was overwhelming. Then, when she spoke to me, my mind made an awful twist of her words - as we were making eye contact, she said, "Can I fuck you?"

My mind went completely blank. My anxiety soared into hyperdrive, and I had entered complete autopilot. I don't even know if I said anything - I most likely just gave her a blank stare. My mind was fighting with my ears trying to replay the words back in my head while a monkey was clashing two cymbals together and I was not good at multi-tasking between the two thought processes.

Then, she came towards me and just wrapped her arms around me, as I wrapped mine around her. Over a span of just a few moments I went from having no contact and being trapped in my own obsessions, to looking each other in the eyes and having a heartfelt connection that happened out of nowhere.

The words she said were, "Can I hug you?" Thank god I didn't have to bend her over on the table in front of all of these people.

She introduced herself, as did I, and I told her that it was really nice to have met her. I think the monkey clashing cymbals really took over at that point because I can't remember whether or not I even acknowledged her presence after that point or what happened next, but I was completely overwhelmed with happiness. My heart didn't stop racing for the next hour, and me and my buddy exchanged high fives and jokes both about the misheard words and about how I managed to swoon the poon with my math skills. 

I've decided that when my children ask me how to get chicks, I'll tell them that they've just gotta find the zero of that polynomial. Gotta get the maths to get the girls.

I'll update this in the future, however now that the ice has been broken in a non-awkward way, I'll be getting her number as soon as I get back from spring break. I've got a really great feeling about this one, and I'm pretty sure some day soon this beautiful girl will be mine :)

For any of those in a similar situation who are guided by music, check out [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iErjaKTX_3w). It's a beautiful illustration of this event. </TEXT>

I don't know if by chance you've implemented advertisements and a certain ad causes this issue or what, but it's pretty uncool. Figured I'd let you know. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The afc system seems to cause misreading on the resistance.

Me and a friend were stumped when it came to this problem. However, we found that he was not adjusting the airflow. He was loosening the 510 connection - and this caused the trouble with reading resistance. Screw your 510 tight, and look for a little notch to turn just outside the circumference of the 510 connection ring. There is a separate notch there for adjusting the airflow - not the flathead screw 510 connection.

<TEXT> If you keep the wattage low, you can surely run the protank on your istick. The beauty about  these regulated mods is that while you can run them at high power, you can also run them at the same voltage that an evod battery would put out (3.7v).

There is a known health issue with formaldehyde which is hypothesized to happen when you run a lower quality tank at higher wattage, so if you were to run that protank at 50w, you may risk heightened formaldehyde levels in your vapor. Dr. Farsalinos Konstantinos hypothesizes that heightened formaldehyde levels can be caused by devices whose wicking speed can't keep up with the heat of the coil - so if you're getting excessive dry hits, you may risk formaldehyde production.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi there!

I spent quite a bit of time last semester and on my own before that point researching electronic cigarettes. My research project for my college english class was on vaping, so I've put quite a few papers together on the subject. If you'd like, you can find my paper [here for viewing or download](http://www.mediafire.com/view/5ev46znw9etboyk/ResearchPaperFinalMyVersionComments NamesRemoved.doc). (Please note that if you're viewing in Mediafire's document viewer, the pictures are going to make the essay look like shit.) It's a Microsoft Word file hosted on Mediafire. All sources are cited.

Also, I found one really solid source from CQ Researcher to be the most helpful in finding a lot of my information. It's not free to access, but if you'd like, let me know and I can probably get you a copy of the article. It'll essentially have everything you need. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Their major complaint is that it draws in kids. 

So does smoking. Science says that if you start smoking after the age of 18, that you are much less likely to become addicted. People start smoking at a hella young age, but you never thought about banning cigarettes. 

One thing I noticed about vaping is that it blows smoking cigarettes out of the fucking water. After you make the transition from smoking to vaping, you cough up all that loose shit in your lungs, regain your smell and taste, if you try to go back to cigarettes, you're going to have a damn bad time. You WILL feel that tar again in each and every single drag, and you will most likely not pick smoking over vaping after that experience, and while knowing that vaping doesn't feel that shitty. 

These kids aren't going to pick up smoking from vaping. If they vape, they're not going to smoke, because it's simply not nearly as good of an experience. Vaping renders smoking useless. 

We'll learn to tell our children not to fuck around with it even if it has awesome flavors, in the same way we tell them to do that with alcohol, even though it has awesome flavors. If parents and teachers engrain into these kids heads to be vape free in the same way they tell them to be drug free and alcohol free, they'll be afraid of it until they reach age.

I just don't understand how these politicians can so blindly, all over the country, outlaw something they know absolutely nothing fucking about. It enrages me.  </TEXT>

 You are my first,

I find you fascinating

You are my favorite,

Lay you down to sleep

It's all that I can do to stop... love...

So blue, so broken,

Paper doll decays

I haven't left you yet

So cold, subversive,

Your eyes are full of bleach

Tomorrow I will go away again... love...

YOU ARE MINE, YOU WILL ALWAYS BE MINE,

I CAN TEAR YOU APART

I CAN RECOMBINE YOU

ALL I WANT IS TO COVET YOU ALL

YOU BELONG TO ME

I WILL KILL YOU TO LOVE YOU (LOVE). </TEXT>

Is there anyone else around him that you can get involved? Parents/family/friends of his that can just make sure he isn't completely withdrawing socially?

<TEXT> Hi friend, fellow college student here. It's a horrible testing struggle-filled time. You said youve got an appointment for a therapist and that is EXCELLENT and very crucial to overcoming this. The one thing I was thinking reading this, is that if you can't afford therapy, does your college by chance have a free therapist on campus? Most do, I believe. 

As far as medication goes, it can make or break you. One thing you can expect is for each and every medication to have a radically different effect on each and every person. What works for one person can increase depression in another person. I wouldn't recommend starting an SSRI during a really busy time in school, and until you feel comfortable with your therapist. If you have a break coming up in college, try starting a med exactly 2 weeks before that break. You'll start to see a change in how you feel on an antidepressant after that 2 week period, and in the case that the med affects you negatively, you then have time to work it out with your therapist outside of school. 

Best of luck! Let me know if you have any other questions.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Medication and therapy -  but more so therapy, have more benefits than one could imagine. Very, very helpful. Never in my life would I have thought that I'd have such control over my anxiety, and for a good period of time after I quit the meds and graduated therapy, I felt absolutely normal - depression free. 

It's definitely worth a try.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you are more depressed than ever, try a new medication. Buproprion (wellbutrin) worked for me in terms of depression, but spiked my anxiety and eliminated my ability to eat anything. 

Generally with antidepressants, there's like a two week period where your mood will slowly start to change. If you feel after that period like you want to end your life, and you can't really pinpoint why, it's definitely time to come off that med. 

I've tried about 8 different meds (SSRI's don't work for me either), and this has definitely become my rule of thumb after I've had some dangerous low moods on a couple of meds (citalopram and sertraline)  </TEXT>

Welcome, and Good for you for getting on here and venting. This is really the first step to getting it out of your system completely.

As to why she might admit that to you, I don't know - that's pretty low of her to do. If you are the only real person she talks to about that stuff,  she might have that real lack of judgement and just want to share her exciting new experience no matter how much she's stepping all up and down your feels. 
She could also be testing to see if your jealous. 
She could also be heartless.

<TEXT> Hey. You're not in the mental state to be able to make the biggest decision in your life right now. It's natural for liquor to make you want to kill yourself, especially when you are mixing it with other drugs. 

I have an idea for you. You want to commit suicide, I understand. But why tonight? If you commit suicide tomorrow, it will have the same result. Why not wait 24 hours or more, and at that time, see if you still want to make this decision. What's one more day? 

I think that if you allow yourself to go to sleep tonight, that you're going to wake up tomorrow with a completely different mindset - free of the liquor and the pills. 

I've been where you are, friend. I know how it feels to have that sudden onset sadness and strong urge to end your life, but it's NOT you talking right now. It's the liquor and the drugs, man. As soon as they wear out of your system, you're going to feel differently.

You CAN DO THIS! Please hang in there.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nicotine will have a peppery / acid reflux type burn feeling on the airways. 24mg was more suited for cheap ego type batteries and clearomizers back in the day - something that produces less vapor in each drag. With that high powered of a setup, you'd probably be good at 12mg/ml. If that is still too rough, try getting an Eliquid that has more VG than PG. Vg is a thicker   smoother liquid, while PG supplies the throat hit.  </TEXT>

The experiment uses:

Three blu eCigs products (approximately 50% of the US market) and two SKYCIG products (approximately 30% of the UK market) were chosen for evaluation. Marlboro Gold Box (US), and Lambert   Butler Original and Menthol products (UK),

Not really relevant to our products, but good for their marketing and FDA approval.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Question about the release date for the iStick 50w </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So we've seen that the iStick 50w has seen some massive delays, from Jan 26th to possibly early March. 

However, on /r/electronic_cigarette, I've discovered that a [few people](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2vnplb/my_mvp_20_died_after_one_year_of_solid_vaping_i/cojjuk6), one who even ordered just 2 days ago, already have the iStick 50w in hand, from [vapeNW](http://vapenw.com/istick-50w-by-eleaf). [Eciggity](http://www.eciggity.com/eleaf-istick-50w-battery/) also has them in stock, as does [OriginVape](https://originvape.com/product/eleaf-istick-50w/). 

Is there any update to the date that we should expect our iStick 50w's? I was sort of expecting that through this group-buy we'd be some of the first to get the product - but it's already on shelves elsewhere. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The film on my car is so bad that at night, all of my windows and the windshield freeze on the inside. Even driving for 40 minutes with the defroster on full blast will not remove the frozen film. When it's not that cold out, my windows are constantly fogged up - even in the rear. I never vape with closed windows - the drivers side window is always open no matter how cold, and the defroster is permanently on in my car while driving. I took rags with rubbing alcohol and windex out to rub all my glass down, but no success.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not weird at all, my friend. That's why it's growing exponentially in popularity. If you feel interested in looking for a setup, you can let me know, or check out /r/electronic_cigarette (hit or miss nowadays). I've done quite a bit of research on electronic cigarettes, and from what I've seen from the data, its a much healthier alternative. My bronchi tells me otherwise after about a year and a half, but I have yet to prove that it's due to vaping, and it seems to be a very isolated experience that I'm having. 

It IS, however, trading an addiction for another if you choose to use nicotine(all Eliquids also come in nicotine free versions!) - but I truly enjoy it and it's a much more manageable addiction due to the ability to fully customize your nicotine intake.  </TEXT>

Depends on the person. As someone who used to struggle with an anxiety disorder, I actually managed to have a really bad trip that screwed me up for quite some time. 

About 50% of my trips would be bad, the longest being 3.5 hours. Actually tried ending my life the next day. 

Now I'm all good though. Blaze on.

Hope this gets answered. My only idea is that the company stopped paying the channel and this is a legal way for the channel or TV provider to require the company to keep paying without actually/fully advertising for them. Just a guess.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem with the original istick 20w is that it will only fire coils whose resistance measures out to equal to or greater than 1 ohm. If it's anything like my 12w MVP v2.0, it isn't powerful enough to fire dual coils, either. Another person recommended the istick 50w. They are expected to be released in late February or early March, but their release has already been delayed twice. I'm still getting one, but just be ready for a wait. I would not recommend a aspire Cf subohm battery to replace the istick, as they are not similar in any way. The aspire battery has one button to push to fire, no variable voltage. It's like a beginners mechanical mod, essentially. 

I think the istick 50w IS going to be great, and I recommend waiting for it if you have the patience, unless you can trade in your 20w istick for the newer 30w which fires sub ohm coils. 

If you like the idea of a Lemo drop on a 30w istick, my friend just purchased this setup and I can send you pictures of how the tank fits on the istick. They are made by the same company, designed for the istick, so it should look good.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for your reply. My main concern here - what I was angry about, was that I thought LazyPancake was a moderator, and when I saw his/her comment:

You're a horrible person. You don't deserve a significant other if you can just so callously brush aside a cheating incident.

When someone makes you their world, when they love you whole-heartedly, and they put all their trust in you, it doesn't matter if you cheated once, or 100 times, you're still an awful human being. You should absolutely tell them. It's called RESPECT. If you don't have enough respect for them as a person to not fuck other people, then you need to man/woman the fuck up and tell him/her.

They always find out.

I was enraged because I couldn't believe a moderator would say shit like that in their own subreddit. 

That part of my comment on here became completely void, and the fact that people were in here just totally sounding off their mouths for OP to "grow a pair" and just totally slamming him, wouldn't have been angering enough by itself to make me want to call out the moderators. I understand that shitty people are everywhere, and yeah, maybe it was like that before I joined. Maybe it was just sort of a bias I had being a new user that I was just happy to be here and didn't really see all of the hate around here, but still I feel like it's gotten worse for sure.

Back to what you were talking about, though, I'm still going to be "that guy", the ass. When it comes to people with just unhelpful harassing hate speech on here (all of /u/j-chance's initial comments), I feel like other subreddits would at the very least delete some of the real nasty things he said. You were concerned about censoring or banning becoming an abuse of power, but with something like what's coming out of this kids keyboard, I really don't think it'd be that at all. It'd really kind of be a good use of the power you have, in my mind. I'm not a moderator, I'm not going to tell you anymore about how to do your job. I appreciate your reply and I don't mean to make you miffed. The purpose of my post was to make whoever promoted LazyPancake miffed out, but turns out she moderators ECR_Plus and not this subreddit. Have a good day, man.

<TEXT> YES! The fogger v4 is excellent, and I came here to recommend it. I got mine in early June of 2014, and it was the only atomizer I used from then until just yesterday I bought another. While it is a rebuildable tank atomizer, when my tank runs dry, I can drip through the drip tip to make it until my next refill, or to try out new Eliquids.

I give the product an 8/10. The flavor is incredible, the vapor production is excellent, and the reliability is spot on - worked for me for over a half year. 

However, it takes a very long time to find the right wicking strategy - it is very hard to build. This alone is why it lost 2 points. It will take you lots of time to figure out how to stop the leaking. 

I myself am a bigger fan of the second to last produced fogger v4 (they put out like 5 versions of the v4, the last produced is the fogger v4.1) with the bigger deck. The bigger deck makes it much easier to wick and build, as the closeness of the deck to the glass of the tank slows down the Eliquid as its feeding from the tank into the coils.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The MVP is a good starter, but take note that although it comes with a tank, the iClear30, the tank isn't really all that great and I wouldn't rely on it. 

Also, really make sure that with the MVP that you keep the [510 connection dry] ( http://imgur.com/fb3lLK7), as Eliquid will get that rubber insulator wet and ruin it. My MVP 510 has failed and doesn't work, cause it's just not all that great. 

Another downside about the MVP is that if you venture into a rebuildable atomizer, the MVP doesn't throw enough amps to power dual coils. 

Other than that, the mvp is a great device. It's perfect for a beginner, and it'll power clearomizers very well. The battery life is absolutely excellent, and the fact that it has an ohms reader built into it is very very useful, even if you outgrow vaping on the device.  </TEXT>

Edit: instead of a moderator trying to help you out, one of them is in here dissing you for wanting to pick up vaping. 

/u/LazyPancake

/u/Lynda73,  how did this subreddit come to this? This is supposed to be a welcoming and helpful community for both those who want to quit smoking and those who want to pick up vaping, regardless of their reasoning. 

Edit^2: I guess LazyPancake isn't a mod, although he posts the daily questions threads. That changes the whole situation greatly.

The option to buy a hot dog did not come up, so naturally I point my gun at him to intimidate him. Then, something I've never seen before happened. 

The hotdog seller just simply fell down, as if I had knocked him over by just pointing a gun at him. As he was slowly falling into his hotdog stand, he hit the propane tank located on his side of the stand, exploding the hotdog stand and killing us both.

That usually means that the 510 isn't contacting the atomizer, or the coil isn't contacting the atomizer, not that there's a dead short in the coil, so I'm out of ideas.

<TEXT> I take back everything I said - old reply deleted. Definitely drunk, didn't realize that you have the new MVP 20w and not the iStick 20w. If the MVP reads NON, there is definitely something not making contact. 

Can you double check right now that if you screw in the old coil, that it does not read NON? 

If it doesn't read NON, confirm that the two coils you are using are the same size and length. If they are, you have a dud coil and need to replace it with a different one.

If it does read NON, this is a known problem with the old MVPs that could've carried over into your new MVP. If all else fails, try gently prying up the center pin of the 510 connection on the MVP, [this thing here, ] ( http://imgur.com/fb3lLK7) with a paperclip. You just need to pull that pin up a little bit to contact your atomizer, then your coil should fire again.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "NON" means that it doesn't detect any metal device, not even a shorted coil. That usually happens when your atomizer does not contact the battery/device (your iStick). Make sure it's screwed on tight enough, that the metal pin in the center of the bottom of the atomizer sticks out a little bit. If it's screwed down all the way, try unscrewing it a tiny bit/wiggling it back and forth until you see a resistance. Try turning your iStick off and back on again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you dive into the court transcript the article links to, even though the article states that he was arrested for disorderly conduct for giving the cop the finger, it turns out that the giving of the finger had almost nothing to do with the arrest. It seems like the finger giving guy swore the cop up and down, and then came at him (saying he wanted to talk "Man to Man" with the officer) in a way that one side says is threatening and one side says was not, and was then arrested for disorderly conduct

Also interesting, here are the cop's reasons for pulling over the car whose passenger flipped them off:


(1) Johns gesture appeared to me he was trying to get my attention for some reason, (2) I thought that maybe there could be a problem in
the car. I just wanted to assure the safety of the passengers, and
(3) I was concerned for the female driver, if there was a domestic
dispute. (uscourts.gov pgs 4 5)

This was in fact really ridiculed in the court report. </TEXT>

<TEXT> People generally didn't like ribbon wire when it came out, but I don't give much of a fuck for the consensus, myself. I've used it only once when I started out, but just pulled the trigger on another reel today to give it a second shot. Check out this page over at [Temco Industries](http://www.temcoindustrialpower.com/product_selection.html?p=flat_ribbon_kanthal)

It is sized by mm.x.mm

0.4x0.1 = 32 gauge

0.5x0.1 = 31 gauge

0.6x0.1 = 30 gauge

0.7x0.1 = 29 gauge

0.8x0.1 = 28 gauge

0.9x0.1 = 27 gauge

What you want to do to find what is right for you is head over to [Steam Engine](http://www.steam-engine.org/coil.asp), under Material and Profile, select Kanthal A1 Ribbon, under Setup, select how many coils you usually rock, select your usual goal resistance, and your usual coil diameter. Then, play around with the thickness of the ribbon wire until you get an amount of wraps you like. 

On my mechanical mod, I generally like about 6 wraps of 26 gauge round kanthal around a 5/64" or 1/10" diameter, amounting to 0.4 ohms, so I picked 0.8mm by 0.1mm flat ribbon wire, and I should have mine in a few days here.

Lemme know if you have any other questions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know why you'd have to take big hits - I run my rebuildable Fogger v4 at high temperatures and I can even get great taste in the tiniest hit - I haven't had flavor only come with big hits. 

~~50 Watts might be harsh, but it might also be awesome!~~ I see what you mean about the harshness of 50w. What causes harshness in an e-liquid is the levels of propylene glycol as well as the nicotine concentration of the e-liquid. With this sort of higher powered tank, you can reduce the nicotine concentration (because you're vaporizing more liquid faster), and run higher vg liquids to smooth out the vapor.

 I run about 30 from a mechanical mod and see room for more wattage. The thing about this box mod is that its output is fully customizable from 2v-10v, and 5w-50w. I recommend this over the regular eLeaf iStick, because it won't fire the Atlantis. The Atlantis' coils measure out to 0.5 ohms and the original iStick, while awesome, fires only down to 1 ohm. There is a 30w eLeaf iStick, which fires down to 0.4 ohms. 

[Here's the spec sheet for the 50watt](http://www.eleafworld.com/product/detail.php/istick-50w.html)

<TEXT> As you go lower in resistance the coil will reach higher heats (watts). This will throw better clouds, as well as warmer and tastier vapor, but it needs to be paired with fast wicking speed in order to prevent dry hits, because you're vaporizing more liquid faster. 

Gradually drop your resistance. If you start getting dry hits galore, increase the resistance of your coils. You can also rebuild them yourself to whatever resistance you desire, if you're inclined to do so. It's easy, but you won't be able to make them dual coils - it really takes a machine to fit two coils that close in that tight of space with no shorts. I used to rebuild mine single coil all the time with cotton for increased wicking speed and noticed much better results. 

If you're purchasing coils, I'd choose 1.5 over 0.8. I don't think Kanger's wicking speed will keep up.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know you said you don't like big clouds and appreciate simplicity, but the newest thing out right now is the aspire Atlantis and kanger subtank. These two tanks (I don't know much about the kanger version) are made to run at warmer temperatures (which while offering bigger clouds will also offer stronger flavor) ,  similar to those of a rebuildable atomizer, while having easy replaceable coils, just like your protank. 

The aspire Atlantis won't fire on your MVP (the coils measure out to 0.5ohms, mvps fire  0.7), but it will fire on something like the new eleaf istick 50w coming out on January 26th ($50), or any mechanical mod.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, friend. You write beautifully.

I've lost two friends of mine to suicide, just under a year apart. One I was close to, but the more recent passing was of a friend who my relationship with is very similar to that of the friend you lost. He had moved away, we became distant, and I had no clue he was feeling the way he was until that one day when he just snapped.

A moment later, I was angry.
Not at him, but at myself for not being there for him. For not being close to him as I should have. I knew a lot about him, but I never took the time to actually be with him.

It seems like some self-blame is coming up here. You wish you had been there for him. The thing to remember is that you couldn't really have predicted that he would have passed away, no one could have - even while knowing quite a bit about his harsh past. Another thing is that maybe it isn't your fault that the two of you became a bit distant - it takes two to have a friendship, maybe there were obstacles coming up in your life that you couldn't control, which prevented you from being close to him, or maybe it was him that grew distant to you. As I'm sure you know, becoming distant from society is one of the first moves those who are deeply depressed or suicidal tend to make - whether it's purposely or inadvertently. He could have isolated himself.

Another huge thing I've learned through some therapy has to do with self-blame. I didn't see this come up in your writing, but I wanted to mention it just in case. In the passing of my first friend who I was close to, I felt largely to blame, because we had promised each other that if either of us were to commit suicide, that we'd go to the other person for help first, and while he kept up his side of the deal, he went to me for help, I had pushed him away - I was fighting with my girlfriend at the exact same time, he really didn't make it clear that he was thinking about suicide, just that he was deeply depressed, and I told myself that I'd meet up with him in the morning to make up for the half-assed advice I was giving him then. I of course felt that I was to blame - that I had let him down, but the important thing to remember is that you were not the cause of his passing - he made a decision - one that no one else could make for him. In the end, it was his choice, and as horrible as it is, nothing can change that. 

 I wanted to forget him, I wanted to push him out of my mind and push him away. But I couldnt. Hes there.

You will come to terms with this more easily far in the future. While right now it is going to hurt every day, the pain does diminish gradually over time. It DOES get better.  While he will always have a place in your heart (and that's not a bad thing, my first friend passed in 2011 and I now smile whenever I think of him - I was lucky to have known him while I did), he doesn't necessarily have to always have a place in your mind. While he is there constantly right now, as time goes on he will be there only as long as you want him to be.  That's okay - remember that even while he left, that he wouldn't want to be a cause of pain for the people he knew. He would want you to smile when you think about him - and I think you really highlighted that well in the last paragraph. 

I wasnt even close to him but he had affected me with so much distress.

This is completely normal. Don't ever feel that you don't have permission to be sad just because you had grown distant near the end. I went to a highschool with a pretty high suicide rate, and I noticed that a death manages to bring down a whole community, whether they were close to that person, once knew that person, sometimes saw that person, or even if they didn't know them at all - they will be saddened by the loss of that person. What you're feeling sucks hard, but it is natural. Also, I feel from some of the memories you shared that you were close to him in heart.

There's also quite a bit of talk of suicide throughout here - that you've attempted, wish to be gone like him, and feel very sad right now. I know everything really sucks right now, and I feel for you - that's why I'm writing. I've been in similar shoes. I feel that for almost all of my life I've been considering and sometimes attempting suicide, and a year and a few months ago, I was hospitalized as well. I just want to share with you that for such a long period of my life, I felt like there was no way out but suicide - that I was destined to go that way, but now, I absolutely love my life. Not only do I not feel suicidal, but my overall feelings/signs of depression have decreased, and my feelings of anxiety have decreased tremendously - even though less than a half a year ago I was diagnosed major depressive with some sort of severe anxiety disorder. I never thought it would be possible for me to feel this way - to look back on all the times I had attempted to take my life and be glad that I had not taken it - but it IS possible, and it IS something that can be in your future, so please don't skip out on the time that you will too feel this way. I'm off my meds, single and independent, in a stable household with a sort of foster family, I've amended my previously non-existent relationship with my parents, in college, with a job, and feeling great - and you can be too. Please hang in there through this time. It's a really shitty tunnel, but there is beautiful light at the end of it - and you don't have to reach it by taking your life.

I really hope I could help a bit. If you want to talk further about this, vent a little bit, ask questions or pick my brain, just please comment on here - I'm here for ya. Best of luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had just moved in, living with a friend of mine and his family. Me and my friend both shared a room, with me on top bunk and him on the bottom,  and I made a point to screw with him every now and then. My friend was out for the night, not going to return until late, and I knew that he was out smoking and would come back home still super high, as he had done the last couple nights before. 

I took some of his clothes, put them in his bed, and filled them with rolled up towels, ie pajama pants with rolled up towel legs with a bit of towel sticking out the bottoms - just enough to place socks on the end. I used a backpack to imitate the size of a torso, towels as arms, and a snowboarding helmet as a head. 
http://imgur.com/rs7FaPM

I then covered the fake person in his bed with the blanket, leaving the feet sticking out, making it look like a person was passed out in his bed face down. 
http://imgur.com/oO0w7Xo ,   http://imgur.com/EAXeEWG

Fast forwarding, I'm up on the top bunk and I hear his car pull in. He heads up to his room, turns the lights on, and just stares in disbelief at his bed for several minutes straight. He doesn't move, just stares, trying to comprehend what the hell is going on, why there are no extra cars in the driveway, so who is passed out on the bottom bunk? Eventually he just couldn't handle it. He turns the lights off and walks out. I then hear a car door close, engine start, garage door open, followed by him just noping the fuck out and leaving to go sleep somewhere else.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not so much insight, just lots of experience with it working on the fogger. The screws naturally rise out a bit by themselves in the fogger, and screwing them down tight keeps the resistance low, however if I want an ohm or two higher, I'll keep one of the screws slightly less tight.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are two resources I can't recommend enough. 

+1 800-273-8255
/r/SuicideWatch 

People call all the time. I've called twice and it's a great resource to have. 

I've also had this same struggle of a wonky sleep schedule due to depression, and the inability to gather thoughts due to anxiety. I always feel like I'm sad as hell, but don't know exactly what or how to talk about it. Going to sessions again and again makes it easier and easier to collect thoughts - it's hard and I feel like it's almost something that takes practice. 

Best of luck, friend.

<TEXT> I've got the opposite advice of tropical walrus. If your atomizer has fallen below 1 ohm, you might be able to unscrew the screws just a tiny bit to increase the resistance. Else, my friend with an istick just unscrews the atomizer from the istick just a tiny bit and it increases the resistance - this is with a nautilus, however. 

Also, your MVP will fire anything greater than 0.7 ohms. The istick fires anything equal to or greater than 1 ohm.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would learn to overcome my fear of water brought on by the drowning of my father by sneaking into a large sailboat and sailing into the open ocean, where I'm met with a horrible sadistic storm that is ever increasing in intensity. As a response I tie myself to the ship and scream at the sky, accepting my death, until the storm eventually passes, I dry off, and suddenly crash my boat into the edge of the world as I know it. The head of my boat cracks through a wall painted to look like a skyline, and I immediately notice a set of painted stairs leading up the painted wall. As the set of stairs leads me to a door which reads "exit", I meet my real father who lives in the moon, and offers me a life encompassing ultimatum: Either I stay with him and continue to live in a world where everyone is watching me, or I venture into the open world. In response to his ultimatum, I open the door reading "exit", after saying

"Good morning, and in case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!" </TEXT>

<TEXT> 30+mg? That sounds like flavor hell - nicotine really dulls down flavor.

Have you considered that having a higher power device allows you to drop nicotine levels because you're producing more vapor in each hit? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great company with nice customer service in my opinion.

My last order was from them on 10/2/14. I ordered GWAR Bloodbath and a refill on Hawk Sauce. The Hawk Sauce I got was pretty different than usual   bad - it tasted like 50%Hawk Sauce and 50%Thug Juice. The Bloodbath was absolutely incredible, though. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Driving across the country tomorrow. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There's a fine line between the amount of long distance driving that calms my nerves, and the amount that has me horribly on edge. 

Driving long distance is horribly anxiety provoking for me, and I've been dreading this trip for the past month or so now. 

I have this irrational fear of my own fear, that I'll panic, lose contact with reality, lock up in traffic and crash, and crashing somewhere completely unknown frightens me.

 These last couple of months I've actually experienced what I'm telling myself is a new symptom of anxiety - having trouble breathing. I've experienced a whole bucket of symptoms, but never this common one. These last few days (it's horrible right now), I've been having to yawn or try to inhale as deeply as possible to scoop a deep breath out of myself, because I feel as if there is something in my upper chest/bronchi preventing me from taking a deep breath. This adds to my fear, because I of course have that part of my brain which is convinced it's always cancer, and I'm worried about suddenly not being able to breath halfway through my trip. 

I also have the worst of luck with cars, and I'm also naturally scared of breaking down somewhere and spending Christmas somewhere halfway between my starting point and destination. 

Thank you for reading -  any words of encouragement are greatly appreciated! I've struggled for some years and seen treatment both from a hospital environment and one on one therapy, however reminders and support will be much appreciated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah. I don't see any evidence of how vaporizers are marketed to those underage. Flavors can be argued, but 74.4% of 10,000 adult vapers on ECF prefer non tobacco flavors. We can also take a glance at the flavors within the alcohol industry. 

Tobacco marketed to the underage and lied about it under oath in a congressional hearing. 

Also it just goes without saying that Eliquid is not water, and what the fuck is a hefty dose.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If the FDA is able to regulate E-cigs because they're considered to Tobacco Products under the Tobacco Control Act of 2009, Couldn't we make electronic cigarettes for the purpose of vaporizing nicotine-free e-liquid only, and just have the user add their own nicotine into the e-liquid?

The Tobacco Control Act defines Tobacco Products to be "any product made or derived from tobacco that is intended for human consumption, including any component, part, or accessory of a tobacco product."

This reaches us only because our nicotine is extracted from tobacco.

However, a nicotine-free e-liquid and a vaporizer for such contains no parts derived from tobacco. The FDA would not be able to regulate that, and we will still be able to purchase nicotine from Wizardlabs and mix it in.

Medications work completely differently for each individual person - the results are so strangely different from person to person, that online reviews will almost never be accurate. I feel that you're also right in that people only post with negative opinions.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi friend, 

I've gotten help, so maybe I can be of some use. 

[This site]( http://m.therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/) proved to be a really awesome resource for me. I was super tight on cash, but I was able to sort therapists by the amount of money they require each session, and I found one for only $35 a session. All you have to do is send them an email introducing yourself. 

Before that, I was in the behavioral health section of the hospital for 3 weeks. While it was a very different experience, it's the best thing I've ever had happen to me in my life. It might be something you could consider. 

Getting help is an amazing step. Depression acts like a cloud on our brains, in a way that we often only see things in one light and struggle to see different points of view - we find reasons to bash ourselves and lower our self esteem when in the eyes of a therapist our thought processes are easily seen as false. Talking with someone is a long process. It will take months. However, I found having therapy each week gave me a huge sense of security and control over my life, not including all of the progress I've been able to make with major depressive disorder and severe anxiety (I've graduated therapy - I no longer go). 

NAMI is an organization that meets for free group therapy all over the US, if you are stateside. 

Is there anything you'd like to talk about here?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi friend. 

I've attempted when I was your age. 

I'm now 19. I did not succeed. What I can tell you is this - I've finally come to the point in my life where I am happy to be alive. My entire life in that age was plagued by constant thoughts of suicide. It is now not that way any more. 

If you have school tomorrow, go and do one thing. Tell your best friend that you weren't supposed to be here today. Explain to him or her. It is that point where your life will start to turn around. 

You have a future that you haven't seen yet, and that is the only reason that you feel as if you don't have one. There are so many moments you're going to experience outside of high school that will cause you to reflect for a moment and think, "If I'd have died, I'd never been able to be here right now, and see this." 

Speak to someone, and anyone. If you're making a really big decision like this, learn both sides. Search for ways that you might be able to continue living - to fix your problems. 

High school grades are not permanent by any means. They are highly fixable. If you do care so much about the grades your getting, then you already have the motivation it will take to fix them. 

Think of who you will leave behind. Talk to them, tell them. Be very straightforward. I've lost two best friends to suicide, and I'd just wished they'd have told me straight up that they were thinking of committing. 

You can do this. Contact me here if you need guidance.  </TEXT>

Music. 

Vape and caffeine. 

I'll hit up a friend if anyone is willing to listen. Use your resources, they'll be happy that you did - it's not selfish. A lot of times theyre hurting, too. 

I'll treat myself to something small. A nice coffee, candy bar, sushi. This goes for celebration too - remember to celebrate when you've made an accomplishment. My favorite hobby is within electronic cigarettes, so I'll order a new toy to play with every once in a while. 

I'll go for a long drive. 

On the worst days, I'll make a list of anything that is positive about this day, or that I'm thankful for. Start small - if you have arms and legs, put it down. 

Cuddling with kitties is very high on my 
List. 

Until very recently, therapy would give me something to look forward to every week. It gave me a feeling of security. 

In addition, I have a very long list of coping mechanisms - things to do to make it through the day, from the hospital. If you'd like me to pull it out, let me know.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Cannot Get Read/Write Access to System </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been really struggling all day trying to adb push a file into my phone, specifically /system/media/audio/ui .

My phone is the Verizon Galaxy S4 - VRUFNC5 - 4.4.2 - Running the HyperDrive ROM v19.0.
I rooted via Towelroot, I'm running SafeStrap Recovery, I have SuperSU v2.16, ES File Explorer 3.2.3.1, and Busybox v1.22.1-Stericson

No matter how I try to achieve read/write through adb shell, nothing has been successful. I have also attempted to go into ES File ExplorerRoot ExplorerMount R/W , however this still does not work. This both doesn't enable me to push files into the /ui folder, and while ES Explorer can try to copy files into it, they end up corrupting.
When I say corrupting, I mean that before copying a .ogg file, it will play via the sound player, but after copying/pasting into /ui, it will not play. Trying to "cp" or "busybox cp" the file from the sdcard into /system/media/audio/ui produces the same corrupted result.

Just an example of a code I've tried to enter in adb shell after su: "mount -o rw,remount -t yaffs2 /dev/block/mtdblock03 /system" or "mount -o rw,remount /system/media/audio/ui /system" and/or "chmod 777 system/media/audio/ui"

Can someone please help me out? I've never had this much trouble trying to customize my phone before.

Thank you!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was following /u/nikondork 's great post last night about [taking apart and cleaning an atomizer](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2o3xny/a_quick_guide_for_folks_getting_their_first/), but I made the mistake of starting this process on my only working atomizer at 1:00am last night. 

Since I've rebuilt it, it only reads on my MVP as a dead short. I've taken it apart and tried rebuilding it three times (this is including the positive terminal and all of the insulators).

I'm looking for someone to help me out by posting pictures of how to piece together the atomizer - where the insulators go relative to the brass pin and the positive terminal. I really need to locate the issue in this atomizer, as it is my only vape and I have no money to pay rent much less be able to purchase another atomizer :(.

Edit: I don't quite understand why this was downvoted. I've helped out quite a bit on this subreddit for the last 9 months now - I've participated in every survey, as well as every CASAA Call to Action - yet when I attempt to ask this community to help me be able to vape, I get shot down.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm just having a panic attack. Things have just been building up in my head and I've been trying to find a friend to sit down at talk with for weeks, but no one wants to listen. I don't expect anyone to read this to the end, but I just need to get this shit out of my head.

I've been dreading the coming of this weekend, because it marks one year since I last attempted, and then was brought in to the hospital. I stayed in the lockup for four days, and then stayed in the partial hospitalization program for an additional three weeks. It's been a year, but still I feel that I cannot stop thinking about the time that I spent in there. At night when I'm trying to sleep, I try hard to stop, but I can't stop reliving events that happened when I was in the hospital. I was just so incredibly alone and stripped off all my coping mechanisms that I've never been so broken at any point in my life. For four days I was forced to confront my depression every minute of every day, and the experience was just horrifying for me. I hadn't hurt myself for years before the hospital, but I started again just to be able to cope with being so completely alone.

I remember every sight, smell, every person I grew so attached to that I haven't seen since, every breakdown, every room, doctors, nurses, everything.

I remember my best friend entering my room that night and having her friend carry me into their vehicle, throwing up before I got to the car,  being rushed into the ER, but I don't remember what I was thinking or feeling before I attempted due to what I had taken - which is just scary. 

I remember the first night I got out, I couldn't sleep no matter what I took. I ended up walking out in the blistering cold at 2:30 in the morning just trying so desperately to do anything to get sleep. I took my friend up on an offer for a place to sleep at about 4am, but when I tried to sleep on his couch, I could literally hear the voice of my best friend as if she was standing over me - I heard her asking me why I did this, why I was doing this to myself. 

When I went in to the hospital, it brought an abrupt stop to college that I still haven't recovered from. I was able to fix one grade, but I still have two F's and one C- on my transcript from being in the hospital. This fall is my second semester ever (I took a semester off) and I'm just so absolutely scared that I'm going to repeat my mistakes and never be able to finish college, and that I will never go anywhere with my life.

I lost my job back in July because I was faced with the most horrible anxiety that I've ever felt in my life. I spent so many hours away from my desk locked in the bathroom on the floor losing my mind - completely detached from reality. A lot of it was thanks to the experimental high dosage my medication was increased to - I developed severe paranoia and delusions, thinking everyone at work was out to get me, and I began to hear things that weren't there. A few times I convinced myself falsely that I had forgotten to take my medication, so I took it again, causing me to overdose at work. 600mg of anything is NOT okay. I took so many medications to just get rid of my problem and be able to keep my job, which worked for over a year, but I ended up being in the worst mental and emotional condition of my life. 

Over time I counted out something like 8 different medications I've tried to take, starting at some point during my senior year of highschool, but no matter what I took, I had averse reactions. SSRIs caused me multiple different times to give up every stable thing in my life and attempt suicide. Other types of anti-depressants would cause an increase in anxiety. Benzos caused addiction, even after they caused severe memory loss. Thanks to benzos, I have a decently large chunk of my life that is gone, I just can't remember where I was or what I did. The SNRI I was given in the hospital and took for over half a year was the most addicting drug I've ever put in my body, thanks to its lightning fast half-life.

Fast forwarding to last month, I graduated therapy in a way, because my therapist told me that after I got back into college, all of my conditions improved so much. I had taken the free time between losing my job and starting college to come off of all of my horrible medications, which was the worst withdrawal experience of my life. I was just so happy to be back and I finally felt that I was making something out of my life, and I was doing it without having to give credit to any drug. 

Fast forward to today, I'm completely horrified of falling back into my footsteps of last year and wasting a whole 'nother year of my life by fucking up school. I can feel the depression coming back, and for almost no reason I just have the urge to end my life. I'm broke. I can't make rent, and as of today my bank account is into the negative. I'm applying various places, but I'm so afraid of falling back into the state of severe anxiety. I haven't paid tuition all semester, and I'm afraid that because of this I won't be able to take classes next semester. 

A few months ago, my parents left me, and shortly after that, my best friend - my one and only rock, moved across the country as well. I had been moved out of my parents house for over half a year at that point, and hadn't bothered to go back and spend any time with them until my dog began to pass away. This was due to a lot of relationship problems between me and them - I had a really shitty childhood and teenage years in that house, with a lot of experiences of verbal abuse, neglect, and a couple instances of physical abuse. I didn't expect them to stay around the state just to be ignored by me anyway, but I am still just upset that while everyone I know is still living with their parents and fully supported by them, mine are across the country and I'm all on my own. Tomorrow, my father is having surgery, and I'm horrified of the idea of possibly losing him before I have the chance to amend the problems we've had over the years. 

I just don't know what to do. As soon as I saw the test results from my therapist showing that I had improved, I KNEW things wouldn't stay that way, that I'd just fall down in this hole again and struggle to get out. I didn't really even acknowledge the improvement. I just don't want to be alone at night, get drunk and try to commit again. I'm so scared of going back to the hospital, and I'm so scared of fucking up my grades. I'm so scared that this is the end.

I don't want to follow the path that my friends have. The first friend I ever had as a child committed suicide, less than a year after a close friend of mine was taken over by his disease and committed suicide as well. I know damn well what it does to a family, friends, and a community, but I just can't shake this horrible low I'm feeling. No one around me seems to give a fuck about me anymore, because no matter who I contact to hang out I'm still left sitting alone at home with my thoughts. I feel like I've been surrounded by death and so many horrible relationships.

I don't know what to do to get this shit out of my head. I just want to get through this semester, and return next semester, and keep my life on track. I just want money. I want to be emotionally stable, and I want the full motivation to get there.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-11-13 06:15:36 </DATE>

<TEXT> **TL;DR AT BOTTOM**

On 10/28, I placed an order for an EHPRO Veritas from [Eciggity](http://www.eciggity.com). On 11/1, when I received my Veritas, I discovered that there was moisture inside the plastic packaging it was in, and that the Veritas was [covered in rust](http://imgur.com/a/UAb9N), [as shown in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2kzt7q/what_do_you_do_when_you_unbox_your_vape_and_its/) which did not name the vendor. 

I sent the following message to Eciggity at 8:31am (Hawaii Time, where they are located) on Saturday, 11/1:
Hi,
I just received my EHPRO Veritas today, order #30021, and the whole RDA has rust on it. This IMGUR link is an album containing four pictures of the rust: http://imgur.com/a/UAb9N . This is a first for me, because I've never gotten a vape product this bad before. I would like to return this product. 

At 11:35 Hawaii Time on the same day, I received an email from Eciggity with a pre-paid return label, and another email stating:

Hello test_subject5880, we apologize about that. Please check your e-mail for your return label and send us back your Veritas clone by EHPRO as soon as possible with a brief note of what is wrong with it. We will send you a replacement once we receive confirmation that you have sent it back to us so please let us know when you do so. 

Wednesday Morning, 11/5, I dropped off the Veritas at the post office and at that time Eciggity immediately sent out a new Veritas to me. 

When I unboxed the new Veritas, [it was just as rusty as the one I had first received and sent back to them.](http://imgur.com/a/IdXGb)

The Veritas is contained in a sealed clear plastic bag inside of a paper box. You cannot see from the outside of the bag that there is rust on the RDA, however, after having sent back a Veritas full of rust, I would have expected them to break open the bag and check the RDA. After having seen the EHPRO Veritas, I would be able to distinct it from a Tobeco Veritas, and would not fall victim to them swapping out the product, so why not open the bag? Had it not been in a bag at all and the rust was in more of plain sight, I would have been mad that they weren't checking the products they were sending out to their customers, and would've asked for a refund and purchased from another vendor. Because the rust wasn't in plain sight, I worded my reply email in this way, on Saturday Nov. 8th, 11:58 Hawaii time:

Eciggity, 
I contacted you on 11/1 when I got my EHPRO Veritas in the mail, order #30021 (https://eciggity.zendesk.com/requests/30021), saying that it was shipped full of rust. You processed the return and we exchanged the Veritas, but the replacement I just received today is STILL wet inside the plastic packaging, and full of rust under the top cap. Please take a look at the images and see that it is, in fact, the product I received today, and that it is not usable: http://imgur.com/a/IdXGb 
I would appreciate it if you could determine whether or not every EHPRO Veritas you guys have is full of rust, and if so I will want a full refund. If you can find a product that is rust-free, Im willing to try one more exchange. 

Although I received an email after I contacted them last Saturday, they did not contact me back. I was expecting a reply on Monday, however all of Monday went by and I received nothing. On Tuesday, I received this email:

Hi test_subject5880, 
We apologize for this mishap once again and are unsure of why this has been happened. We will send you another Veritas for exchange. Please use the return label to ship that one back and we will send you another one. This time we will check the product before sending it out, so the product will have already been opened upon arrival. Please include a note indicating reason for return. 
Thank you. 

After sending the second Veritas back to Eciggity today, Wednesday, I received the following email from a different rep. 

Hello test_subject5880, we have received your return for the first Veritas clone by EHPRO that had rust/machine oil built up on the inside of the atomizer. We noticed that the RDA has been used after being cleaned with no rust/machine oil residue traces at all. Our return/exchange policy clearly states that the item being returned/exchanged must be in unused condition to be eligible for any type of return/exchange. However, we went ahead and sent you a replacement Veritas clone by EHPRO anyways assuming that you did not use the RDA due to the rust/machine oil build up inside of it. This is going against our policy and we would like to know if you cleaned and have been using the second replacement Veritas clone by EHPRO we sent you. 

Absolutely enraged, and feeling that they were trying to use semantics to screw me out of my money, but holding back, I responded:

I did not clean or alter the second RDA in any way. All of the components in the box remained in their plastic packaging except for the RDA itself. I removed the top cap, saw rust, and I immediately repackaged the RDA. When it arrives at your shop, it will be in the same condition as I received it in.

.

Thank you for letting us know. We will be waiting for your return. 

.

Will I be receiving a replacement product? 

.

We are currently out of Veritas Clones by EHPRO, but we are expecting to receive more some time next week. We can send you a replacement once we receive them. 

.

That is absolutely NOT okay. I ordered my Veritas on 10/28 and I still have yet to receive a clean product. 
In response to your comment about your return policy, Yes, I did attempt to clean the first EHPRO Veritas, however there absolutely was still rust under the deck's O-Rings that no elbow grease could get out. You can also see, at the bottom of the box, the original O-rings for the RDA, which still have rust on them: http://i.imgur.com/fWlV2qs.jpg . While the RDA was cleaned, I still supplied picture evidence in my first message that the product had rust on it, before cleaning it. I know this wasn't my determination to make, as shown by your return policy, but I don't believe that first product or the second RDA I received could be rightfully sold to any consumer no matter how much rust was scraped off of it. If you want to get into
the details, the description for the RDA also clearly states that it is
"made of all stainless steel." As a consumer, I should be able to
expect that stainless steel will arrive to me free of rust. I will absolutely not wait until next week to have you ship out a product to me that could still be full of rust. I did not receive a working product and I deserve a full refund. 

.

Your card has been refunded the amount of $19.79 ($21.99 with the 10% discount) as we see that your return is on its way back to us. You should expect to see the refund back to your card in about 3-5 business days. 

This is absolutely the most frustrating experience I've had with any vendor. **The purpose of this post is not** to convince people to stop using Eciggity as a vendor. This is to document a super-shitty customer experience. I think it is important to document this because, while all companies make mistakes, and this one happened to make about 5, if we start to see another bad experience with the vendor, and then another, we can start to determine as a group that maybe the vendor is not reliable.

###TL;DR

I got a rusty Veritas from Eciggity. They paid for return   second shipping. I sent it back, got another rusty Veritas. I had no response for a couple days. I received another paid shipping label and a promise that they'd check the product this time. After I shipped the second Veritas, I received a rude email from the company saying that I violated the return policy. When asked if I would still receive a replacement, they told me they were fresh out, and I had to wait a week. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've had this friend since my Sophomore year of high school, and I feel differently about her than I've ever felt for any one person in my life. 

She is the only shoulder I've ever had to cry on, and the only person I've ever really been able to always confide in. I have trust issues due to a lot of really bad relationships and losing two of my friends to suicide - I just really don't know who is going to stick around anymore. However, she always has. Whenever I've been at my absolute worst in life, she has always been there to help pick me up. Back in the days of highschool, when I was still living with my parents, when fights would break out in the family, she would ALWAYS show up just to help me escape from the situation. There have been multiple occasions where I've driven to her house and just broke into tears, and she'd be there at any time of night to hold me and calm me down. 

Last year, right before the end of the college semester, things got horribly rough. On a bad night, she came into my room with a friend to carry me to the car and into the ER, and comforted me through the process of being admitted to the behavioral medicine inpatient ward, and she was the first to come and visit.

Now, approximately a year after that experience, she left tonight - moving across the country. I just don't know what to do, because I feel a whole new level of insecurity knowing that if I fall down again, she isn't going to be able to be there. My three weeks in the hospital made me such more of an independent person, but I still **need** that one person in my life to confide in. My parents aren't around anymore, and I don't have family, and while I have other friends, there is just such a level of understanding that is missing, as well as trust that I'm not ready to give.

I just don't know what to do. I was just told by my therapist a couple weeks ago that I made such drastic improvements that I don't have to come to therapy anymore, but I still feel as if I'm falling back into that hole. I'm so scared that I'm going to end up in the hospital again and screw up college again because of it. I would feel like a failure if I wasn't able to complete a semester of college.

What do I do? How do I handle this? My other half is gone and moved on, and I'm so scared. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is Nicotine gum considered a Tobacco Product by the FDA? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-21 02:04:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Nicotine Replacement Therapies(NRT's) are products such as nicotine patches, gums, nasal sprays, inhalers, and lozenges.

This is how the FDA defines a tobacco product:

The term "tobacco product" means any product made or derived from tobacco that is intended for human consumption, including any component, part, or accessory of a tobacco product. This includes, among other products, cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, and smokeless tobacco.

It is my understanding that the nicotine in NRTs is extracted from tobacco plants.

However, I cannot find any information that suggests NRTs are tobacco products.

Electronic Cigarettes contain nicotine extracted from tobacco plants, and by this definition, however, are tobacco products.

What is the difference?

###**TL;DR Does anyone know, preferably with a source included, whether or not NRTs are tobacco products?** </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello again, all!

My first essay posting went way better than expected - [it reached the top three postings on the front page!](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2gq8w4/i_wrote_an_essay_against_rjreynolds_119page/)

I'm now asking for some help finding a topic for my third paper. The paper will be in the format of an "extended definition." **This will take a closer look at defining a term that is ambiguous.**

The paper asks for a closer look at a word, term, phrase, or idea relative to personal vaporizers/electronic cigarettes/vaping that is important for a reader to understand well in order to understand why I support vaping.

**TL;DR**: What is a word relative to vaping that can have more than one meaning, that I could spend a paper prying open the definition for?

**THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH!** </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi all,

I'm writing an essay to counter-act parts of RJ Reynold's 119-page submission for banning electronic cigarettes.

RJ Reynold's says, These systems are highly subject to adulteration and tampering, they are manufactured largely overseas in facilities that would, as proposed, fall outside regulatory inspection and oversight, **and many nicotine liquids are sold in non-child-resistant packaging** in flavors that may be appealing to youth.

However, I've never seen a bottle of e-liquid that does not have a childproof cap. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is vaping menthol safe? [Serious] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-12 08:10:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all!

I've read bunches of studies on the safety of the four ingredients in e-liquid, but a close friend of mine who I just set up with a starter kit brought a point to my attention that I had never before considered.

I absolutely love menthol flavors, always have. I always remember hearing, however, that menthol cigarettes can cause the crystallization of menthol in the lungs, so while I treated myself to the occasional menthol pack, I always stayed away from camel crush and other super-menthols.

Is this the same with vaping, or even true at all? I believe that the FDA acknowledges menthol mist as safe in throat sprays, and that it's obviously safe to ingest with it being in so many pain relief lozenges, but has anyone seen studies relative to vaping menthol over longer periods of time than one would use a throat spray for? Can this cause harm? 

Any knowledge sharing is much appreciated, and I'd very much appreciate to be pointed in the direction of any studies or experiments that people are aware of. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Did you crack your tank on your Fogger v4? [Replacement Review] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-08 21:57:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm sorry to hear that. [I did as well.](http://i612.photobucket.com/albums/tt206/DrewbtheNewb/Vaping/IMAG0503_zpspvvgiglj.jpg) I searched around on the internet for a replacement only to find that a great amount of vendors are sold out. I did however find two replacement tanks for the Fogger v4 at http://froginfog.com/.

A new glass tank is currently $5.95, while they also sell a metal tank for $8.70. I placed my order for both items on Friday - 6/27/2014, and they arrived at my door on Monday, 7/7/14 (Keep in mind there was a holiday weekend). FrogInFog does offer free shipping. Because I was in a rush, I did request expedited shipping (Domestic Expedited Registered Mail (USPS, UK Royal, Australia Post, etc)) for $4.28.

I was worried that the tanks would be the incorrect dimensions, but I made this post just to reassure buyers that both tanks DO fit and match the original tank exactly.

Here is an image of [all three tanks.](http://i612.photobucket.com/albums/tt206/DrewbtheNewb/Vaping/IMAG0502_zpsxpp2llcp.jpg)

The original is leftmost, the FrogInFog replacement glass in the center, and the FrogInFog replacement metal tank on the right.

I was also amazed that the metal tank fits flawlessly. [Here is an image.](http://i612.photobucket.com/albums/tt206/DrewbtheNewb/Vaping/IMAG0500_zpscgh9eqw3.jpg)

<TITLE> Vape juice tastes like Rubbing Alcohol? (MBV Resale) </TITLE>

<TEXT> I had a new vaper come over to my place tonight so I could show him how to rebuild and run him through all the basics. He hopped right into a hybrid Spyrax mod, so needless to say there were a lot of things to run through.

After building with my usual supplies and his juice, we vaped. In the first exhale I took, I could taste something like rubbing alcohol fumes, and I could feel it in my nose. He bought his juice from a new local shop, and it was a 15ml bottle of ~~Mount Baker Vapors Rainbow Roundies~~ (SEE EDIT).

Is this anything to worry about?

EDIT!: The Local vape shop created a label that looks exactly like MBV's labels, but it is instead for their own produced juice, called "Rainbow Candies." I am now concerned that the juice is diluted or dangerous. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Flooding has me very frustrated and sticky. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-27 22:58:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Every tank I have used so far has had flooding issues. My hands are always sticky, my new Panzer is always sticky, puddles leak out in my pocket and I don't notice until I'm too nicotine buzzed to understand what is going on. My EVOD leaked, my Aerotank leaked, and right now my Fogger V4 is leaking horribly, and I'm just more than put up with it.

The Fogger v4 is an amazing device. It really throws clouds, it was built well, has amazing airflow, and I love it. I just can't get any of my builds to not leak or have bad dry hits. I use organic cotton, and I have tried more cotton, less cotton, cutting all my wicks at 45 degree angles, inserting them into the juice channels and keeping them out of the juice channels, and I just cannot seem to figure it out and master this art.

###What I'm looking for 
is for my much loved fellow brother and sister ECR members to advise me of any device that will never flood, or they have at least had extremely minimal floods on. At this point, my next purchase will be anything that is guaranteed to not flood out of the air holes.

I'm also looking for any tips for RBA building, whether they are on the Fogger V4 or not, that would help me minimize my flooding issues and still be able to chain-vape (or at least take long draws) with no dry hits.

Please advise, I am very frustrated. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I would advise that vapers stop buying original Kangertech Aerotank. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-27 03:56:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In my time on ECR, I have seen a lot of people with problems relative to their Kanger Aerotanks. I bought the Kanger Aerotank in January of this year shortly after it was released. It is in my opinion the most frustrating and horribly designed piece of metal I have ever bought.


The culprit of the issue is the [three piece airflow base for the Aerotank](http://imgur.com/a/R00zT). It is not made of the same stainless steel, it is instead a cheaper, bendable metal. The three pieces are as follows: The rotating airflow control ring, and the two metal pieces that hold it - one of which screws into the tank, one which holds the floating terminal and screws onto the battery.

The two bendable metal pieces which contain the rotating airflow do not have threads to hold them together. They are instead pressed together. The problem this causes is the slow but constant gap that forms between these two pieces - which causes the coil terminal to be unable to contact the battery terminal.

If you are really confused as to why your Aerotank is not vaping, and you keep throwing new coils into the tank, and keep screwing it onto different batteries, this is why this is happening. 

Along with the fact that the Kangertech dual coil designs flood like hurricanes without rewicking, in my time of owning the Aerotank and it being my only upgrade tank back then, I spent 75% of my time trying to get my Aerotank to work and 25% of the time getting as good of a vape as I did on my EVOD. It came to the point where I had to press down on my tank and get it to bend just at the right angle every drag in order to be able to vape out of it. When that didn't work (it commonly didn't), I had to take apart the tank completely and press the coil towards the battery in order to get it to contact for a good 15 minutes. While vaping and driving, whenever I shifted with the tank in my hand, the tank flew across the car, and the airflow control ring went missing.

I have since then given up on the Aerotank and I'm not even able to use it as a backup tank, but I really want to get this out there so people don't have to have the same struggles as I did. Kanger has a great product line, and the EVOD is the best way to start vaping, but if you are going to go Aerotank, at least try the Aerotank Megas. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Problem with MVP 2.0 and dual coil rebuilds </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm trying to get the max potential I possibly can out of my MVP 2.0 and my Fogger v4. The problem is that while rebuilding dual coils on any device with the MVP, is that they heat up HORRIBLY slow - my 10 second limiter kicks in right when they finally get heated.

When talking about the best resistance range for the MVP due to the limits it has, /u/Fortinbraz said

anywhere between 1.2 (where you would hit the device's amp limit) and 2.3 (where you would hit the devices voltage limit), you are good to go up to 11W.

The problem is that when I get even close to dual coils at 1.2 ohms with 30 gauge kanthal, I'm running two coils with 2.4 ohms resistance and they heat horribly slow.

What is the highest power build I can run on my MVP 2.0? </TEXT>

I spilled a few drops of Mountain Dew in my eye yesterday, and it burned like hell, but I was able to wick it away with my t-shirt.

In the shower this morning it felt like I had an eyelash sticking into my eye, so I twisted my eyelashes in a towel and everything felt fine. Now it's just sore as all hell, and I pulled my eyelid back just to investigate, and I was like OMFG what the hell is that. Any assistance on this topic would be greatly appreciated.

<TEXT> I've made this mistake about four or five times now.

I go into the work bathroom to clean a flood out of my vape, or I'm simply near/on the toilet vaping and I take apart my vape to add e-liquid, when my whole world comes to an end. I drop one of the four items I am juggling, and I hear a horid splash followed by a solid CLINK. A piece of my vape has now entered the toilet realm.

I try and I try again to not let pieces of my vaporizers fall into the toilet. I even took everything apart in a cabinet in the stall not above the toilet, but that wasn't enough. I knocked over my tank, it bounced off the floor twice, and committed suic1de with the help of some angry devilish force giving it enough inertia to fling itself into the toilet.

The worst is when this happens in the morning at work, and I absolutely know I will be fucked for the rest of the day.

Does this happen to anyone else?
Why does this have to happen to anyone to begin with.
