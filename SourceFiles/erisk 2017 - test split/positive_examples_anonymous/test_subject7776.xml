<TEXT> Fuck yeah, I have experience to comment! Where I worked, the franchise paid minimum wage to drivers (8.05) but after a checklist, you'd get a 50 cent raise (8.55) we made 5% on all deliveries, and only delivered 5-8 mins from the store. Not all that bad, can quickly get deliveries since it's all fast-paced, meaning I could do 12 deliveries in a few hours with 3 other drivers (this was at a slow store) so I'd come home with 30-50 bucks for a few hours of driving. (Though I had a V8 and got 13mpg so it all went to my tank) I wouldn't do it again. Not with my car. Management was good, but I rubbed them the wrong way once and got fired. Oh yeah, and the daily beatifications suck dick. There's a list of things that NEED to be done before the day is over and basically only drivers can do it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ex-Sonic Employee here:
Mine has done this too, You probably were in the Employee restroom, (Which has an entrance from inside the store, and the outside.) We can't fit all the buns in one room so we'd put them in the restroom that no one is suppose to be in, until we could move stuff around and fit them, or the bread man would take them back on his truck. They're usually there for maybe 2 hours tops.

You probably were in the restroom you shouldn't have been, and no one uses it, at least at my old store, whilst food is in.
Plus that restroom looks clean af.

<TEXT> Hey guys, I haven't done a give-away in a long long time, so I figure I might as well with the new update!
[It, as of this moment of posting, is worth about 4$](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/StatTrak%E2%84%A2%20USP-S%20%7C%20Torque%20%28Field-Tested%29)
[This is my profile.](http://steamcommunity.com/id/test_subject7776) Comment a number between 1-1000 and I'll pick a winner tomorrow around 6pm Mountain time.
Thanks guys! Have a good one.
EDIT: I just realized that since I unboxed it, I can't trade it ASAP, so I will add the winner and trade you on the 3rd of June (1 week from now) That is my fault, I'm sorry.

<TEXT> I hate when people don't go with reputable exhausts, cause that shit can sound either good, or dog shit. I looked at so many catbacks before getting ATAKs, I was considering Flows or Magnas, but Borla just suits it.
I got mine from CJ Pony Parts, But both AM and CJ hiked the ATAK price up.. :( 847$ is a bit much. 800$ is O.K. I have a discount from a Mustang Club I'm in, so I got it for 760$. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It won't be stock for long ;) gonna get an exhaust set up as soon as my tax refund gets here, then lower it, CAI, Gears. Just gotta save money here and there. Things surprisingly quick. I feel like the 0-60 time has to be off, it doesn't feel like 5.4 seconds at all. I definitely am more of a "look good" type of guy. At least at this point, since I went from 145HP to 260HP and it was quick the difference. DSG is easily one of the best colors for NewEdges, or really any mustang. It hides dirt and dust pretty good, it's just rock chips that it shows like no other.  Hopefully you get your GT sometime in the near future. So much fun. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is not my car, it is my friends and I was a passenger at the time of the accident.

Story:
Went to go around a [Con-Way Freight truck](https://media.glassdoor.com/o/40989/con-way-freight-office.jpg), we had just turned onto a new street and were in 2nd, max speed I feel was 50, and when he turned to go into the other lane to pass, he turned too sharp and it kicked out and we went into the curb, then bounced and hit the truck and went under it a bit (rear bumper has a huge hole in it, and the c pillar is smashed and rear glass is all gone). After hitting the truck we went back into the curb and bounced over it, down a ditch and hit a tree.

I think its going to get totaled. What do you guys think?

It only had a CAI and a Cat-back. </TEXT>

Yup, it was literally one exit before PAVS.
I'm not saying he doesn't deserve one, obviously 40+MPH over could seriously hurt someone, and with what we were doing, I'm slightly surprised we didn't actually hit anything. They gave his GF a ticket, which she's obviously upset about, but she was basically doing what we did, on a lesser extent.

So he paid 35k instead of 37, but after taxes and stuff it was low 40 according to his girlfriend. They were really nice and kind about everything. They let us have a test drive (which they're strict about, since who wants a "new" car with 100 miles on it already?). They cracked jokes with us and let him take all the time he wanted with buying. </TEXT>

Personally, I haven't driven it yet so I don't know how it handles, but my friend said it handles amazingly.
And seeing him do a slide in a cul-de-sac, I believe him.
Berge Ford in Mesa had a few GT's, if you actually wanted to drive one. They also have a 50 Years Limited Edition, but its a 50k car. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He got it on the 29th, had it for 6 hours, we went to go to an Instagram meet-up held in Scottsdale. The cop said he saw us going fast but wasn't going to do anything, and then he started going faster, and faster, we hit 95, and then the cop got next to him, no lights on and waited until there was room to pull him over, then he talked him.
From what I was told by my friend and his passenger, is that he told him he was following us for quite some time, and then asked my friend what he does for a living, to which my friend told him hes in the Marine Corps, and the cop said "You don't want to die do you?" and "Do you like your car?", he told him to slow down and to tell me to slow down.
Probably passed at least 5 cars pulled over on the way back.
And his girlfriend got pulled over by the same cop a little bit down the road for 84 in a 55, but wrote her for 74 in a 55.

He was a pretty cool cop, I'm glad he didn't pull me over, or I'd be out a car.

And thus concludes story time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My friend had planned to surprise everyone with him coming home Thanksgiving morning from his Marine MOS school. I went to pick him up at 3am and we surprised everyone. We had planned a trip to Flagstaff for that Friday and before we went up, he wanted to see a few Mustangs, as he told me he wanted to buy a new car. There was this one, or an 04 Cobra with 78k Miles. He drove the GT and we left saying "We will be back tomorrow." After we left, its all we could talk about that night and into the next morning. We came back from Flagstaff and even before he went to our homes, we went to the dealership. His mind was made, and he bought it that day. He already had gotten pulled over once in it for 95 in a 55 (construction zone). (Thankfully they went after him and not me!) I'm the only one he will let look after it and make sure its clean, so I get to buff and wax it tomorrow, since there already is a scratch.

<TEXT> It's a 2004 DSG Mustang GT, 40th anniversary, Premium, has 24.5k miles, no real problems besides just some cosmetic things, like oxidation in the third brake light and on the driver side headlight, has a scratch behind the tire and a small dent, and has a scuff on the passenger side front bumper that I plan of buffing out this weekend.

Overall I'm in love with it, its my favorite body style, has all the little doodads I wanted, (keyless entry and power windows are a god send).

I can't wait to start making changes to it.

<TEXT> It's definitely about how you look at it.
I understand that it's hard, and you get yelled at, which is fine. It toughens you up. I've wanted to join since I was a small child, it is about pride to me and about the benefits of college, friendship, and strengthening myself. My uncles have gone through it all, and one of my only friends has been enlisted for little over a year in the Marines. Whilst another is currently in BT for the Army.

Yeah you can get lonely, homesick, and all that. But that's life, and that's what I choose.

Thank you, and the guy you commented to, for both of your inputs. I greatly appreciate it! </TEXT>

It also had my birthday almost to the exact everything, but was off by 1 day. They also had my email.

Thats if you just want to replace it completely, which might be the best option.

Also a comment that might be important to you (found in the comments on the item): After reading about the chrome and paint coming off, I decided to spray a couple layers of clear coat on them. Made them shine a little more and no peel over time.
Over 12 months installed. Maybe 6 on the road and out of the garage.

I know it's not all fun, there are long hours, bad pay, conditions can be shit. I understand its not all GUNS, 'MERICA, 'SPLOSIONS, or fun.
Drill instructors will yell/scream at you for every little thing you do wrong and how you talk.
Which I think is a good thing, I need a new experience, and learn how to get over things, or I'm never going to.
I just feel like it'd be nice to fight for the person next to you instead of yourself, for once.

Maybe I'm thinking about it wrong, or what not, anyways, sorry if my post didn't make any sense last night. That is my bad! :P </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I had no idea it was a big deal until he said that I can't join and that no one will take me for a year.
I had to go online and read about it today, which was a surprise.
I feel like I can ween off my mood stabilizers/anti-depressants, and I'm scheduling an appointment to see if I can.
I was getting ready to hit the gym to so I can pass the physical tests too. Well, Now I have a year to get in better shape (not saying I'm in bad shape, I just don't think I can pass the test)
Its one year, school gets out in 6 months, summer is 2 months, so really all I'm missing out on is 4 months. Sure I won't get to go with my friends, but I'll get to go someday. </TEXT>

So that put a little damper on my parade, I've wanted to join since I was little and I learn I cannot.
Sorry, I just wanted to express and inform people who might want to join some day.

I had my birthday on the 12th, I wish I wasn't here as well. I had gotten out of my second time in a mental/behavioral center for suicide. I even attempted on my birthday in 2012, I just don't care for life. It's boring, and they're making me do out patient shit, which is just large group therapy.

Happy birthday though. Good luck with your life. </TEXT>

I would be willing to send well, snacks, or anything you might need.
Ex: toiletries and the box of chips like [this](http://i.walmartimages.com/i/p/00/02/84/00/04/0002840004026_500X500.jpg)

<TEXT> I love to sleep. I'd come home from school and go straight into my bed. I like the warmth the blankets give off, sure it's not like a humans but its better than nothing. I also have cute purple panda stuffed animal who sleeps next to me.
But on Friday, the 28th, it didn't happen this way. I had done something I shouldn't have ever done. I sent a nude to a girl while I'm currently with someone else.
(Note: I did this before in my last relationship and, well you can guess the outcome.) I am the worst when it comes to keeping thing like this a secret. The guilt was eating me so I told my girlfriend what I had done. Needless to say, she was pissed. Now, I've only had depression or at least enough to where it stands out enough to be noticed and medicated, since my last relationship. I should have learned from my mistakes, but hey, I'm a teenager! Since I'm a teenager I jumped from point A to suicide. I'm the type of person who just wants to die all the time, and this whole mess just messed me up. I do already have my own disabilities like ADD and so on. So anyways any moment where my downstairs kitchen room was clear I would run an take some pills. In all I had taken 15 anti depressants, my last 2 ADD pills, and about 25ish+ painkillers. To my surprise I didn't die, I only got some pain in my leg, feeling like a baby was kicking my stomach, and my vision messed up for a while. I do wish I had died. I had found the love of my life, and well.. Messed up. Don't get me wrong my current girlfriend is amazing! But I have this connection with the girl I dated first (We will call her Kat). I just always want to be close to her and protect her. Kat actually wanted me back once but I decided to go out with my current girlfriend (We will call her Hannah). Because Hannah has liked me since gosh knows when, she always cares and asks me things, and also plays games with me. Kat has moved on, and of course, to one of my friends. I know I should get jealous ad or upset over these things, but I can't help it. I should be the one she sleeps with her head on. I do not make the best choices. I mean I usually pick the opposite of what's good for me, and I realize that I really wanted that other choice when it's too late. I've spent sometime searching the house where I live, for the gun we keep. But I can never find it and eventually end up sitting on the nearest bed and crying. I've even tried to over dose on my birthday, my birthday!
I just wish I could sleep for the rest of my life. 
If only my pills worked. They're just too weak to give me happiness.
I'll probably make my own post tomorrow, seeing as I can't get on the computer right the moment, as its 2:45am and I haven't slept in 30ish+ hours.
Good night guys, I hope you all have a lovely sleep, and wake up with a smile. </TEXT>

<TITLE> How do I stop the thoughts? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-09-01 00:41:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> During school I am perfectly fine, I laugh (Well... giggle), smile, and am generally a positive person. I get all my work done in class, I never have homework, I help out people when asked. I try my best to just help. But when I get home I am instantly having suicidal thoughts, I fight with my girlfriend, and I just overall hate everything.

I feel like I'm just a horrible person, I believe I have let my father down. He wanted a smart child who likes what he is into, But I'm not smart in my eyes, and I don't like sports and NASCAR and all of that stuff, I tried to play sports to please him but after I cracked my head I said "I don't want to play sports again" and I haven't. I like games, and girls...
I've never heard my parents say "I love you." I know its hard to believe but I just haven't. They don't go out on dates, or kiss or anything. I feel like its my fault.
People think, "Oh Travis, You have it was easy you get what you want and can do whatever."
But getting what I want isn't fine. My parents do not have a college savings account for me, nor my brother. My brother (who is smart) got a little bit of a scholarship and it makes it easy for him to go. I, however will not get a scholarship, I don't get 100% on tests and I don't do the best work.
So, I don't know what I'll do for college. I don't want my family to take out another loan. I would like my parents to just go out on dates, and act like a married couple.
I take medicine but the dosage seems to be too small, if I take 2 I'm happy all day and everything is fine.
I noticed myself getting depressed after a break-up, I tried so hard to make everything up and talk to her, I wrote a 6 page letter to her, and she just ignored it. Awhile later I had tried to search our home for a pistol we keep for safety. I searched often when no one was home and could never find it, and I'd usually end up sitting on the bed and crying.
On my birthday, sadly, I had tried to OD. My birthday wasn't good.

I don't want to die, and I don't want to have these thoughts, but they won't leave me alone. I just want to have my parents be a couple, I want my my father to say hes proud of me, And I want to be happy.

Help? </TEXT>

I had somehow found a friend, who was new as well and thought me how to use voice comm. We went around the building and found the hospital. I stumbled upon some Anti-Biotics and headed up the roof. I called for my friend to come look at the view and I made a dash for the ladder to see if he was coming, I ran off the roof and died instantly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So we were playing Day Z (7 of us) and we were in an open field checking a deer stand (of course it had nothing), we heard a shot and one of us died, we all proned down and DC'd. (Yes wussy move, wanna fight about it?) We reconnected to a new server and messed around in the field recollecting ourselves and healing our injured. The moment we were all ready to go we heard another shot and again, another friend got shot and died. We all hit the deck and now we're just waiting it all out.

Now I'm scared. </TEXT>
