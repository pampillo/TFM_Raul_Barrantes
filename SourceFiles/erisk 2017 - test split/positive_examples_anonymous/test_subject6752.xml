I tried to sit for an hour before and drink coffee in Dunkin Donuts, but a stranger literally just sat down with me. I had to leave.

I feel creepy but I didn't want to be late, so here I sit for an awkward length of time.

This is My first therapy appointment since my assessment, which my wife came to. I'm nervous about being alone with my therapist.

four sets of braces - who says their kids want them or need them?

music lessons - see above

tutors, sports team fees, gymnastic class, dance recitals - see above.

pediatrician co-pays - maybe they have great insurance

babysitters, vacations, the minivan, the driving lessons, the teenage car insurance rate hike - not needed, wants. 

four SAT prep courses, four college educations - not needed. Scholarships, grants, etc exist as does saving through summer jobs and kids who want trade school.

<TEXT> In your brain, you have a "map" of your body. It's the reason you can touch your nose without a mirror and why you can wipe your ass without missing a bunch of times first. This map tells you where all of your parts are. For transpeople, their map tells them that they have parts they don't and don't have parts they do. For instance, many transmen have a "phantom penis", extremely similar to phantom limp syndrome. Their brain map says that it's there, so, even though it physically isn't, they can sense it. 

Gender identity is solid, and inherent. It cannot be learned or learned away. In a case of a set of twin boys, one received a botched circumcision, so the parents chose to have him Go through sex reassignment surgery as an infant. As an adult, he transitioned back to being male, despite being raised as and told he was a girl. 

The only proven treatment for Gender Identity Disorder is transition. As I said before, gender identity can't be learned away. There is a really high suicide rate for transgender people; they face massive amounts of discrimination, are very often disowned, poor, homeless, and especially for transgender women of color, live in constant fear of being murdered. Once a person has transitioned enough for them (it varies due to cost and outlook of surgeries for what a transperson may want out of transition) that suicide rate falls. Incidentally, being prevented from transitioning makes it rise, even with counseling.

Now, I don't know if it was intentional, but you cut off the end of my remark on chromosomes being irrelevant. I specified that many intersex people (those are people who are born partially male and partially female either chromosomally or physically in appearance) do not usually stand out as being "in between". They are raised and presented as either boys or girls, most often girls because the surgery is easier and better. That shows that, unless there is a medical problem or a transition, an intersex person can live their entire lives not knowing they were intersex and strangers wouldn't know either. This goes back to gender being assigned at birth but identity being inherent. In resent times, there has been a move away from performing sex reassignment surgery on infants for any reason, including intersexism and botched circumcision because very often, the parents guess the wrong gender identity, leading to force a person into a transition they wouldn't have had to make. 

I'm not sure if you were trolling asking for more information, but if you have any other questions or if anything I said was unclear, please ask. Sorry for any typos, I wrote this on mobile. </TEXT>

We really don't want to deal with a home study and get permission for her to be our child's mother. I can't seem to find any information via Google though, so any help helps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually, biology and neurology are exactly what make Caitlyn Jenner a woman, just not chromosomes, which aren't really relevant as plenty of people who are intersex are easily read one way or the other. As for Rachel, well race is a social construct, so how one can identify as something that isn't real I don't get, but maybe she identifies with what she stereotypes to be black culture, and I guess that's okay but making up all these bullshit lies isn't. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My mom has really bad health, and for the last three years, every trip to the doctor for her has delivered worse news. I finally have insurance and I should go, but thinking about it gives me anxiety. I think I have hypothyroidism, which my mom has, and I know the best thing is to treat it, but I don't like needles. My depression and possibly the hypothyroidism has made me obese, which I've been since childhood (I'm 20) and thinking about getting on a scale is giving me severe anxiety and I know having no choice would send me into an exhausting panic attack. Can I refuse? Should I explain on the phone first that it's a trigger for my panic attacks? Can I insist on only testing thyroid stuff with blood work? I don't have the energy to deal with anything else and the idea of more is causing me anxiety. I don't know if this is the right place, but I just wanted to know. </TEXT>

You aren't below average; just average. That's normal.

You have survived to 23, so you aren't a failure.

Your life is not the lives of those you graduated with.

23 is like 60 years more to make a change.

You know some flaws so you can change them.

You're well articulated.

You're capable of admitting to not understanding. That's a hell of a lot better than most people winging it.

Adulthood isn't having all the answers; it's being willing to look for them.

<TEXT> I am liking not working. My mom is very sick and physically disabled and work was the one thing I could cut out reasonably - education is paramount to me, so I'd rather struggle for money than not go to school. My job was contributing for sure. I worked as a companion to a man with Down syndrome and, while it could be rewarding and was like no real work (I actually got paid to go bowling and play in parks) it was stressful to be responsible for him especially when they stopped paying. It has helped, but it's hard to judge as, two weeks after I quit, my mom was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver because of fatty liver disease that we didn't know she had. That's been really hard on me, but I know it would be much harder if I were working on top of it.

I am very extroverted. I love talking to people in person. I just have strong opinions and I'm sort of judgmental. I look forward to meeting new people and I want to help. I am a social work major and I want to work with mentally ill adolescents, so I will be happy to make suggestions. 

I'm very excited about school. I'm switching from community college to a university, and it's a large state school with a massive gay community (I'm butch so since I'm very visible that's important to me) and I'm hoping its a more adult atmosphere than kids screwing off in CC. 

My wife is my rock. She helps with my mom and does anything I need to help me. She is a wonderful person.

I don't feel cursed, lol. The girl's ex told me about it. I have an acquaintance who is weird about stuff like that who gave me some sage to keep in my car "just to be safe" but I don't really think she "cursed" me, at least not in any way that really affects me. 

I will certainly check that book out. I've tried talking on here about building friendships and something I learned that worked (other than the fact that I used it on someone awful) was to act like people are already your friend, and the friendship will built; that even though it's scary, you need to ask people to hang out first. Right now I'm just isolated and having a hard time finding people to build friendships with. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's my understanding; that we are all similar.

I quit working in part because of my depression and in part because my job stopped depositing my pay. My wife is on board with that decision and works more to pick up the slack so I can work on me. I haven't started group yet but the only people I really talk to are redditors and rarely conversation on Facebook. I have been told that I'm peanut butter and a lot of people are allergic to peanut butter; I don't make friends easily. I had to drop out of college this semester due to family stuff, and I am starting at a New school in August, so I'm hoping I can make friends there, but a year and a half at the first one only got me a Santaria witch that tried to put a curse on me so that wasn't great. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't think you don't help her; it probably just hurts that it's long distance. I'd bet a 100 bucks that it's the distance that hurts her, not you. Maybe in a year you guys can close that distance and resume. Try being friends. Without being pushy, tell her that you love her and care and are there for her in any capacity she needs you to be. Show her that you won't leave her that easy; I've noticed that women especially fear abandonment due to depression. (I'm also a woman who has this.)

Also, people can't be fixed without fixing themselves. Trying to fix someone else will never fix you. If you have health insurance or can afford to, seek counseling, even if just for a short time. I don't know the intricacies of your relationship with her, so I'm just going with what I know. Someone else may be able to help you more. 

Don't be afraid to look elsewhere for love. You may surprise yourself, but note that it's hard to love someone else when you don't love yourself, so work on you a bit before jumping right in head first. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not saying you are wrong, I just offering another point of view. Feel free to disregard.

Porn: even if you severely limit is ability to get it, he will see it. Its a world of smartphones and WiFi everywhere. Perhaps explain, instead, that porn can quickly become a dangerous addiction. Maybe offer to on-the-sly buy him magazines; they are less hardcore and not the videos that many people are hooked on. If it matters to you, explain that pornography actresses are actresses, they are real women doing not real things. You would never want your wife/mother/sister/etc to be in a situation where she was forced into it; most pornstars are such because of limited options. 

Premarital sex; I actually hope my kids have premarital sex. My mom, before my wife and I ever got married, told both of us to "try on the shoes before you buy them". She and I agree that you should be sexually compatible for the best chance at a strong marriage. We also think you should live with someone first before marriage to make sure you can live together.

Sex in your home: if he is going to have sex, he is going to. By outright disallowing it in your home, you actually put him at risk. If his partner's parents do the same, that leaves public places and a chance at arrests. My parents had an unspoken don't as don't tell policy on sex in their home. 

A big issue with religion in the modern world is that it struggles to line up with it. In a society where tinder is a thing, it's hard to expect a 16 year old kid to remain abstinent. Its hard for that kid to remain abstinent. Try to mold your beliefs around the world, where possible, and offer explanation beyond religion If you want your children to remain Christian. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My girlfriend (now wife) and I were 16 and together for six months when we started to have sleepovers. We were supposed to be in different beds but that never happened. We are gay, though, so pregnancy was never really an issue and we were both so young that we were only ever each other's sexual partner so neither were STIs. Because of all that, my parents were lax when my brother, at 16, started seeing his girlfriend. They are still together at 19, so I guess it worked out okay. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know; by 5 and a half months, it's kind of be a mother or let someone else be a mother. As you said, there has to be a cutoff and she was after said cutoff and to a point where most people would agree It's far too late to abort. I don't know if it's mentioned in this article, but the CNN story says that the boy lived for an hour before finally passing away. That's wrong, to intentionally do that. I don't think she should receive the death penalty, but she does deserve to be punished; she intentionally ended a viable life.

<TEXT> Hahaha well she was sort of seeing/friends with a girl at my table so she was around a lot. I've always had a ton of male friends so she thought I was dating three guys at once. We ended up having a lot of friends in common and when things went sour with the other girl, she came to me because, since I was gay, it was a safe spot. We became friends fast since I'm wonderful and yeah. I made a point of being a shining star for her. I stuck up for her in two different lunch time drama events and then waited for her by the busses the next school year and carried her bookbag the one time each day I had the opportunity. I didn't know how to go about proving myself without being "the guy" so that's what I did. 

Fun fact: it took me three months from meeting to learn her name. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was 15, I met this girl in the lunch line at school. The first word she ever said in front of me were to a mutual friend about me; "Can you please get this girl the fuck away from me?" 

For me, it was love at first sight. It took six months, but I finally told her how I felt. She rejected me, but nicely, saying that if how she felt changed, she'd tell me.

Two months later, she said she liked me, too, but was afraid of ruining our friendship. Three days later, she finally changed her mind. That was October 10, 2010. By December we were picking out baby names. 

On Wednesday, it will be our 6 month wedding anniversary. I love this girl more and more every day. She's so great. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Skincare on a Budget, a guide. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-05 00:44:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> One thing that, growing up, always dissuaded me from proper skincare was the cost. When you are poor, the investment is often too much to come up with, even though many products will last you a really long time. I have excellent skin to begin with, though it is very sensitive. I get hormonal acne when I ovulate and during my period, but mostly my skin has always been clear. I have created a guide for products that I've used and have seen work well but are low cost and not harsh on my sensitive skin. Obviously I'm not a dermatologist, so your results may vary.

**Spot Treatment**

**$1** [Acne Cream](http://www.dollartree.com/Acne-Cream-1-5-oz-Tubes/p346503/index.pro) as it is simply titled has worked great for me. It disappears and I add moisturizer over it and have never had any drying. It only costs a dollar and is available online at that link or at most Dollar Tree stores. 

^*Ingredients* ^Salicylic ^Acid ^(.5%), ^carbomer, ^cetyl ^alcohol, ^dimethicone, ^glycerin, ^glycol ^stearate, ^methylparaben, ^propylen ^glycol, ^propylparaben, ^squalane, ^triethanolamine, ^water

**Cleanser**

**$1** [Acne Wipes](http://www.dollartree.com/Premoistened-Acne-Face-Wipes-30-ct-Packs/p321467/index.pro) which are also simply titled are something I use once every other day. Also available from the link and Dollar Tree stores. 

^*Ingredients* ^Salicylic ^Acid ^(.5%), ^water, ^cetearyl ^Isononanoate, ^ceteareth-20, ^fragrance, ^cetearyl ^alcohol, ^glyceryl ^stearate, ^glycerin, ^ceteareth-12, ^cetyl ^palmitate, ^propylene ^glycol, ^methylparaben, ^disodium ^EDTA, ^propylparaben, ^2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1, ^3-diol

**1$** [Acne Cleanser Pads](http://i.imgur.com/6s6Nyaq.jpg) weren't listed on the website for Dollar Tree, but that is where I have purchased them. They are a bit stronger than the wipes and I use them when I have breakouts, still every other day, and when I'm in a rush.

^*Ingredients* ^Salicylic ^Acid ^(1.0%), ^alcohol, ^aloe ^barbadensis ^leaf ^juice, ^fragrance, ^polysorbate ^20, ^sodium ^chloride, ^tocopheryl ^acetate, ^water

**$6.47** [Equate Gentle Skin Cleanser](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Gentle-Formula-Skin-Cleanser-16-Fl-Oz/10417272) is used before either of the other two products, as neither are true cleansers. This is a generic version of the much raved Cetaphil product and is much cheaper and very effective. It also has the option of leaving it on your skin and not requiring a rinse. It's slightly expensive at $6.47 for 16 fluid ounces.

^*[Ingerdients](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Gentle-Formula-Skin-Cleanser-16-Fl-Oz/10417272#Ingredients)*

**Exfoliation**

**$2.97** [Equate Blackhead Clearing Scrub](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Acne-Medication-Blackhead-Clearing-Scrub-5-oz/10403006) is a product for under three dollars that works very well, including clearing up sebaceous filaments. It is a little harsh, and I can only use it every other day to every two days, but it works immediately and the effects last. It is a physical exfoliant and a lot of people don't like that, but I like this product. 

The ingredients are in the link.

**Moisturizing**

**$6.47** [Equate Moisturizing Lotion](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Fragrance-Free-Sensitive-Skin-Moisturizing-Lotion-16-fl-oz/10403103) is another product comparable to Cetaphil. When I first bought this, I hated it. It took me a while to learn that only a very small amount should be used, otherwise my skin was greasy and it was causing breakouts. Like it's cleansing cousin, it's a bit more expensive at about $6.50 for 16 fluid ounces. 

Ingredients are in the link.

**$6.27** [Equate Oil-Free Ultra-Gentle Facial Moisturizer](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Oil-Free-Ultra-Gentle-Facial-Moisturizer-4-fl-oz/37233433) is a smaller bottle for about the same money, but never left my face greasy no matter how much I used. It's a 4 fluid ounce bottle at about $6.25. 

Ingredients are in the link.

**Sunscreen**

**$1-$5** I generally just buy what doesn't eat my face from either Five Below or Dollar Tree. I used trial and error to find one for me, and it's baby sunblock. 

~

With the products that I use, I spend about $3.50 a month on skincare. I used poor lotion until I could swing the good stuff and it never really hurt me, other than learning that I'm allergic to Jergens but I only used it for three days. Dollar Tree carries moisturizer, but I've never tried it. If anyone has, please offer input. I built as I needed to, not everything at once. I hope this helps even one person to be able to take care of their skin on a budget. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't mean for this to sound so excited; I had just learned it and I get over enthusiastic about everything. 

My wife and I have discussed hysterectomy and once I have a baby we will probably take that route; my mom and maternal first cousin both had cervical cancer that left them both infertile (I was a huge thought to be impossible surprise after 16 years). I don't want to end up risking it, and my mom (who is my best friend) and my wife are all in agreement that that is pretty much the best route. 

I actually want all tissue removed. Any scar tissue is a heightened risk of breast cancer. I don't care if it isn't quite male looking. I am genderqueer and mostly just care about not wearing a bra. Regardless of the results and cost, I will eventually have a mastectomy to have all of the tissue removed. 

I don't want a positive result. Despite my planning to remove affected organs, I plan to have at least one biological child and I don't want to pass it along. I just like to have as much information as I can get ahead of time and I like learning from other people's experience. </TEXT>

Edit: my information was apparently wrong. I learned in a social work class that it was for everyone; apparently it was meant that it *can* be for everyone.

<TEXT> Your second analogy is actually great. Questioning can feel a lot like not knowing who you are and being wrong about it. That's why, when a person finally comes to a real conclusion, it's better safe than sorry. They won't be offended by you trying to hard to accept them, but may be hurt by you seemingly not trying have enough. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're putting words in my mouth. That's not even close to what I said. She earned the medals while presenting as a man and being male. I don't know the rules for trans* Olympians, since I'm not the least bit interested in the Olympics. In my opinion, people should participate with the gender they present and/or identify as, regardless of sex, and if that changes in the future that has no bearing on the accomplishments, but I don't make the rules. 

Since you are clearly looking for a fight, please go TERF elsewhere. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In typical babydyke fashion, we talked about marriage from about 2 weeks in. It was always an inevitable. There was never a huge proposal in a super immediate way. On our nerd anniversary dating I gave her a ring in Texas Road house and asked her to marry me at some point. However, setting a date was done by us sitting in a college sociology class and me realizing that her father's income took her out of financial aid. I wrote her a note explaining such and we talked to my parents (who we live with) and got their okay. We talked to her mom the next day.  </TEXT>

My brother is constantly calling my car a go kart and just a general dick about how much better he is than me. It really hurts me and I really hate it. He is completely irrational and talking to him about t would do nothing.

TL;DR my brother is a dick. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am a 20 year old woman. I last shaved my legs the night before my wedding, which was December 10th. I last saved my armpits roughly one month ago. I last shaved my pubic hair sometime in January, I think. 

I'm a small part Native American, and it presents in low body hair and reddish toned skin. My legs don't really appear hairy, as what there is is blonde and thin. My armpits have enough growth to feel the breeze from the fan if I'm shirtless. 

I absolutely love it. I feel sexy with more body hair. I feel more myself, not working so hard to remove what is naturally growing. I bathe regularly and wear deodorant, so smell isn't an issue. Not shaving makes me feel at home in my body. 

My wife loves that I'm more confident. She loves that I like my body more. She also knows that, if she asks, I will remove all of it for her. 

I wear shorts and don't care, though I don't quite have the confidence for tanks right now. 

My sisters in law are all 14 and 15. They are all super feminine and don't get why I'm comfortable this way. I don't need them to get it. I need me to be happy, and this helps me be happy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It seems like I went through webMD and picked symptoms. 

I have irrational, uncontrollable anger that I can't handle well in many situations. I'm very emotionally unstable; I can go from ecstatic to livid like the flip of a switch, and I handle neither particularly well. I have really bad abandonment issues for no apparent reason and it manifests in my testing relationships and generally being an asshole to make sure people don't abandon me. I nearly always feel empty; the only time I don't is during extremely special happy events and when I drink. I make a conscious effort to control my drinking and drink less than once a month, and I'm a lightweight so literally two Smirnoff ice and I'm drunk. I drive and spend rather recklessly and I find myself dissociating and unable to really change my off the wall actions. I also have a history with self harm.

I've read that BPD is often hard to diagnose because people with it don't want to be criticized so they won't mention shitty things they do. Because of that, I feel like a fraud, like if I really had it I couldn't be this self critical. I've had some of these symptoms for a long time, but stuff like the dissociating is very recent, like within the last year. The only stable relationships I have are with my wife and my mother. I go through "friends" like water and I admittedly am a terrible judge of character so I pick them poorly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My mom is my best friend. She supports transpeople, just not me transitioning. She fostered over 50 children, partly because she was infertile. Almost all of those children were boys. She wanted a daughter so bad. When she got pregnant with me, she was 38. She says she knew immediately that God wouldn't make her wait 16 years for a sick boy and that I was a healthy girl. She had my brother two years later; my older brothers were adopted before me. 

When I came out as gay, she struggled with it. That didn't last long, but at that time she made it clear that I could "transition ten years after (she) was dead." She reiterates that periodically as well. When I started keeping my hair short, she struggled, but I tease her and tell her that I brought home my high femme wife so I'm no longer obligated to be femme. 

In 2012, she ended up in the ICU for 11 days and almost died because of a whole host of medical issues we didn't know existed. We worked on them for two and a half years before learning that she has non alcohol related cirrhosis. She remained sober her whole life (her father was a drunk) so that she could avoid that exact problem. If you didn't know, there is no treatment or cure for cirrhosis. 

I don't get very many more years with my mom. I know that for sure. It's in the early stages, but it sometimes progresses very quickly. I don't want to waste what little time I have making her view me as a man when I know that is the last thing she wants to do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I (20 AFAB) identify as genderqueer and transmasculine. I have done nothing to transition, medically or socially, because I don't want to risk my family for it. My mom got three sons and me and has made it clear that she will not support transition. Recently I've started to realize that I have a lot of symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder. One of the symptoms is inconsistent identity. I bounce around from full male to almost female identity all the time, but it doesn't feel the way genderfluid is often described; it's harsh and difficult and hurtful and confusing, not fluid at all. I also have depression and anxiety. I was reading the post about dysphoria and it's effects on you without you knowing and I was just wondering if this could be at all self inflicted. I know you guys and gals aren't trained mental health counselors but if you know anything, please share. I'm sorry if this sounds crazy or in any way transphobic, I don't mean for it to. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you're leaving something out. You come off a bit misogynistic, or at least completely oblivious, for other reasons. 

I am very high libido married to someone very low libido. She was low libido before we got married, but it got worse after. It isn't that she doesn't want to fuck me. She truly just can't get there. She can't force herself to be in the right head space. She also leads me on quite a bit. She'll spend a day promising me and sending me dirty texts and at night she just can't get there. Its not that she intentionally lied, she just isn't there, and that isn't her fault. 

You aren't wrong for wanting compatibility, but it seems like you never really tried to have a heart to heart with this girl about this. Her explanation sounds like she was raised to believe that sex is for marriage, and she feels shame for having it before. It's a really destructive mentality that causes a lot of issues. It sounds a lot like you got an answer you didn't like and didn't want to work on the issue.

For a lot of people, security and love are needed to feel comfortable to have sex. If she was asking you to listen more, she wasn't feeling enough of those things to be comfortable. 

You were a bit of an asshole in telling her that was the reason. You took something out of her control that you knew was an issue early on and threw it at her. Her libido is something she can't change. The only reason to give a reason when breaking up is so the person can work on themselves for their next relationship. All you did was make what already seemed to be a big insecurity worse. I think She dodged the bullet. </TEXT>

I used to be friends with this guy. One night, I'm driving him home cause we had been hanging out. We are all just chatting when he says to my wife and I, "Do you think Canada wants to kill us since we share such a big border with them?" I flipped out explaining to him why he was a goddamn moron. 

I worked for 18 months as a companion to a man with Down syndrome. It was mostly to help me build my resume as I'm a social work major looking into mental health, and it's related enough. The same guy as the Canada situation **tagged me** on Facebook in a picture of a cat with "Down syndrome". In fact, the cat was missing a facial bone and I explained why that was impossible and why saying it had DS was insensitive and actually extremely offensive. He said that people would do their own research and that he wasn't taking it down because he wasn't offending anybody. 

I no longer associate with that individual. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes and no. While HIV cannot kill you, when it turns to AIDS it can. However, we are no longer in the 1980s. People can go 20 or more years without HIV turning to AIDS. Even when it does change over, it is no longer the death sentence that it once was. It is fairly easily managed and medical researchers have managed to bring viral load levels down so low that it is nearly undetectable, effectively curing the virus, but with the stipulation that one must remain on antiretroviral medication for life. While AIDS was a deadly epidemic at one time, it is now closer to the flu; some people will die, but many more, with effective treatment, will be fine for a very long time. Since we don't arrest people for going out when sick and knowingly passing it along by touching things in public, it's a bit of a stretch to say that its attempted murder. More sensible would be a charge for fraud and a charge for assault, but that's just my opinion. </TEXT>

Often, people like me wear the same clothes as men and boys a few years younger. Obviously, if stores took advantage of that, they'd lose a lot of sales to said boys. There are a handful of smaller name designers that focus on clothes for women who are masculine. I generally learn about them online. There are even maternity brands dedicated to masculine people. I belong to such a small demographic that for anything that is big name it isn't worth the money and potential loss to market to me. </TEXT>

My family is local; I'm a sixth documented generation graduate of my high school. People who come here from New York and New Jersey bring gang violence, drugs, entitled attitudes, littering, and more with them. That isn't to say that all people from those places do that or even all that come here do, but plenty of them do bring all of that here, and it sucks for those of us who are local and don't want those things here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm anti-two piece for girls prior to high school. I have seen too many times men leering at little girls. I feel that two piece suits sexualize them and their bodies when they are too young to know what that means. I am also against Speedo style suits for little boys for the same reason. Children should not be sexualized. Tankini style suits are okay as long as the bottom is shorts style, not like a bikin, in my opinion for my children. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I assume you've heard of phantom limb syndrome, where amputees can still "feel" their body parts. For me, dysphoria is a lot like that. I can feel that my chest is supposed to be flat. I can feel myself get erections and I can feel that I should have testes. I have, on more than one occasion, gone out into my house where four other people live shirtless because I seriously forget that I have female breasts that can't just be waving around in front of my father.  </TEXT>

It helps me to realize that a lot of people have no choice right now; wages are too low and prices are too high. My wife and I have a tiny cramped bedroom, but we are together and we help my mom out. I'm also unemployed. My mom is physically disabled and I do a lot that she can't. Maybe something to help you feel you have purpose is to take over household responsibility a little at a time. 

I don't know if this helps at all but I hope so. Best wishes. </TEXT>

That's why my wife and I didn't hyphenate but it doesn't really affect me if other people do. 

Edit: when we went for our marriage licence it was also explained to us that getting Social Security when you are old can be difficult with a hyphen and that paperwork gets weird. They suggested that we either pick one name or each keep our own. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Disclaimer: this is my personal experience and it certainly varies by person and location.

The only reason a person who makes too much for SNAP to have an empty refrigerator is wasteful spending. My wife and I finally broke down and applied and were called that day because we qualified for expedited food stamps to the tune of 300 just for the two of us. We had no idea we were that poor. Prior to this, we were still eating every day. It was pasta and shitty sauce, but It was food. I do taxes for my family. Last year, my parents made 25,000. My mom hasn't applied for SNAP, though I can't figure out why, but no one goes hungry of them, my brother, his girlfriend, and what they do to supplement my wife and I now that we moved back in with them. It's about budgeting, which everyone has to do. When I was receiving SNAP, if we wanted to eat something besides pasta, we had to work to stretch that money. Yes, the day we got it, we had a full fridge, but the day before we had almost nothing.  </TEXT>

Unless you were drafted, you took the job and knew the risks, just as you would to be a teacher or a Wal-Mart cashier. You're free to disagree, but that's my opinion. Though, I have a soft spot for families that are reunited.

<TEXT> I don't know if you guys are at a level for marriage talk, but something that has helped open My wife's eyes is to point out that, in wedding vows, you say "to have and to hold" which means "I promise you sex and cuddles". I give her as much of the hold part as she wants, so she needs to do some of the have part. 

Also, you need to find out why she hates going down on you. If it's uncomfortable, consider getting throat numbing spray. If it's a trigger to a past abuse, find out how to get around that trigger. It's her fault she isn't keeping up her end of the relationship, but it's a partnership and if you help her it'll be easier. 

I know you aren't quite to that point yet, but check out /r/deadbedrooms. It helped me a lot in figuring out how to deal with this. Some people there like myself are trying to prevent a dead bedroom, others have been in one for ten or more years. 

I wish you luck in talking to your girlfriend and don't ever feel guilty for wanting to have sex with her. You love her and that's a great way to show it, but also don't intentionally make her feel guilty for not wanting to, it's her body and she gets to make the decisions on what she does with it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We communicate on it regularly. She has extremely low libido and doesn't like to be pressured at all. We have talked outside the bedroom about the issue and I have given up on trying to initiate. When I do, she cries and then I have to comfort her and then we go to sleep. I love her, don't get me wrong, but if I had known this would happen at 6 months in, I would have either addressed the issue or gotten out. </TEXT>

You referred to your SO as your girlfriend, not wife or partner or fiance. Before you do this, please make sure you are certain about this relationship. Its not fair to the kid If you aren't. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Been with my wife 4.5 years, married 4.5 months. In my experience, it won't change. I love going down on her but she does it for me maybe half as much and almost never gets me off that way. Before we got married, we had sex about twice a week, sometimes more, and after we got married, we had sex like 15 times the first week and now we haven't had sex in two and a half weeks. Prior to this it was about every other week but apparently is become even less often. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My wife and I are married. We both are working on getting our degrees. She works full time and I'm taking time off to cope with my depression. I graduated high school a year early. I worked for a year and a half as a companion to a man with Down syndrome. I take care of my physically disabled mother. 

Four days ago, my wife's sister had a son. She is 19, doesn't work, doesn't go to school, has no life plans and has cut the baby's father out of his child's life. She lives with her father because he will pay for everything since it's a boy. 

I want a baby more than anything. So does my wife. We don't get to have one because we aren't "stable" enough but this stupid kid and plenty of other stupid kids do. Its bullshit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Guys, don't just downvote, explain why he's wrong.

That is extremely unlikely to the point of being almost impossible. Selective breeding is often inbreeding. This passes recessive traits along instead of letting dominant, better traits show. It is extremely unlikely that very many recessive will show. Do a little research on genetics. Start with basic 8th grade Punnet Square type stuff and see if it helps you understand a bit better.

However, it's pretty useless to invite the one who will do the most bad to sit down to dinner by default. I'm a liberal and a married gay woman. If we get the wrong republican in office in 2016, I run the risk of my marriage being called invalid and having businesses be legally permitted to
 discriminate against me. We all run the risk of bathroom bans for trans people, no more healthcare for everyone, and supreme court judges being appointed that will ensure that that remains for a long time.

Who cares what happens to the country?" you aren't actually taking a stance, you are simply throwing a fit and not contributing.  </TEXT>

I think you give really good advice. Even though they are connected, the three are separate issues. Damage control seems to only be possible if we are honest and explain all of it to the family members. My wife plans to deal with her sister after she gives birth. This isn't the first time her sister has done things like this but for us it will be the last. My wife intends to pretty much go no contact with her sister except in regards to her nephew. It is for the best if I don't talk to the sister in law because my anger and hatred will explode and then her father will get involved and it will be ugly as ever.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Her family is kind of crazy. She has a 37 year old uncle who walks past me and ignores me at family functions. His wife also will only give me dirty looks or talk about her dog. This stupid, immature behavior is the kind of thing I experience every time I'm around them. 

The wedding happened so fast. We went from being in a long term committed relationship to being married in 6 weeks, not even really having an engagement. Since it happened so fast, we didn't get much time to think about who to invite and we decided that no one in my wife's family needed to know besides her mother and four younger sisters. The other family members live far away and we felt that asking them to take a day off of work to drive several hours for a wedding that was mostly just for legal purposes was pointless and unfair, especially since we will be having a big wedding in a year. 

When her cousin asked, we didn't know she knew and assumed it was confusion since it was asked in such a way that that made sense. We were maintaining what we thought they all knew as the truth. 

Our omission was meant to save feelings and avoid hurting people. We also felt that, if we chose to share it, doing so at her other cousin's wedding was not the place. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My wife and I have been married for four months and together four and a half years. We had just begun planning our wedding when we found out that she was set to lose her financial aid for school. We talked to my parents and her mom and they all understood that unless we got married, my wife had to drop out. We didn't want anyone to know since it happened really fast and we couldn't afford to invite anyone. It was in the middle of the day on a Wednesday so no one could have really made it anyway. In an effort to avoid hurt feelings we only had our immediate families there. We put on Facebook that we were engaged.

My wife's sister, who was 18 and pregnant at the time, instead scheduled a doctors appointment and skipped her sister's wedding. She has tried to sabotage our relationship from the beginning; she has told both of my wife's parents terrible lies about me and has even physically attacked me before. She only knew we were getting married because she lived with my wife's mom at the time. 

My wife's cousin got married this weekend and we were asked by her other cousin if we were married. We said no, as that is what we agreed upon. We found out that her sister told the family that we are in fact married. I am livid. It was not her place to do that and I'm tired of her invading my life whenever she can. My wife's father, who abused my wife and I in the past, was also not supposed to know, but we are sure she told him as well.

She is being induced this Wednesday and I have made it clear that I will not be driving two hours to her father's house to see her. My mother in law is angry that I won't do this but I can't stand my father in law or sister in law. My wife agrees but doesn't want trouble. What should I do?

Tl;dr: sister in law is an asshole and I'm expected to coddle her. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, I think women just want someone experienced. I'm a lesbian. I would not sleep with or date a virgin. There is just too much responsibility in making sure you don't fuck their first time up. Maybe it's because women put more emotional value in virginity loss and to men it's more of an accomplishment.

All my opinions based on generalizations of course.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I live a few hours from Philly, where the Mazzoni(sp?) center is, which is where most of my friends got their T. I keep thinking about using some of this money to do that, but I didn't think I wanted hormones right now. 

I have round about discussed being trans with my mom and she is 100% not on board. My dad makes comments about transpeople that say he is the same. My wife would be fine with it, as we have discussed it at length, but we currently live with my parents. 

I'm just really not sure where I am right now on all of this and it sucks. I generally don't bother to bind because it doesn't really work anyway but when I do my dysphoria is all but gone. I am open with my whole family about the fact that top surgery is an inevitability and they all seem okay with it as I've explained it that my chest is too big, but a reduction can put me at higher risk for cancer so they're on board. 

I'm sorry if this is all over the place but any insight would help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Disclaimer: I'm left than left and love Elizabeth Warren.

She is too left. Hillary is much more moderate and older, helping to secure votes. She is a known name and not for rocking the boat out right on things that people more right don't want rocked. Elizabeth Warren can't secure the votes because she is too young and too new and too left for the comfort of most. I also doubt that she will run and step on Hillary Clinton's toes to try to be the first female president, which I personally find admirable. If they both run, the right will construe it as a sexist cat fight and that will make them both lose. 

Personally, I'm voting for Hillary Clinton because I like her and what she stands for. </TEXT>

Edit: I'm not saying my answers are right, just that groups are definitely privileged. I don't think it's possible to prove that masculine gay men are not the most privileged group of lgbt people, aside from perhaps straight transmen that pass extremely well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a genderqueer lesbian, so my perspective is skewed, but here is how I see it:

Gay men, particularly masculine bear types on top; rather "normal" and the male privilege to boot. Feminine gay men are a close second.

Lesbians, femme on top with varying degrees of butch behind them. 

Then, we have branches. Transmen get male privilege when they pass but all the medical advances really give transwomen the privilege, so it is really about which matters more to the individual. As a whole, society doesn't love transpeople. 

Bi people fall within their respective gay/straight depending upon their relationship at the time, though they deal with erasure based on their relationships. If they are with someone they are immediately either gay or straight and whores if they are single or have multiple partners.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not a chart, but a summary. 

Everyone (gay and straight) call bi people whores, so they don't like anyone.

Lesbians don't like bi people because of too many "bi" girls who just want to experiment. This fuels bi hatred of lesbians because they claim it is "bi erasure".

Transpeople think that everyone hates them so they hate everyone first. Straight people think they are just really gay, gay people think gender and sexuality shouldn't be lumped.

Gay men hate more feminine gay men for being attention whores.

Lesbians don't like straight men because they feel objectified; straight men in turn feel that lesbians try to out-masculinize them. 

I think that's about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry, I was out car shopping.

I would say that in the sense that I experience dysphoric feelings, it's a disorder, though in the sense that something is "wrong" with me, I wouldn't. I learned in psychology in college that to be considered a mental illness, it has to cause negativity in your life. If you hear voices but they are encouraging and good, you're not mentally ill, despite the fact that it may be inconvenient. Based on that, while the dysphoric feelings suck, they don't in any way hinder my life, so no, I'm not experiencing a mental disorder or illness.

I don't know the cause. My "brain map" of my body isn't correct to what my body actually is. That seems like it's either psychological or body related. I don't much care how I'm perceived but I present more masculine, so that is a societal or environmental factor. 

I began identifying as genderqueer at around 14 or 15. I'm 20 now. I had a friend who came out as a transman and was doing research when I fell upon the term and it fit like a glove. I have memories from childhood that I call "signs I was trans". I can remember being 7 trying to make a prosthetic penis to pee through with a toilet paper roll. I can remember being about 9 and seeing an episode of SVU about transpeople and crying because I assumed by parents did that to me as a baby and couldn't just love me as the boy I was born as. I can remember praying for my period at 12 because I thought I would actually feel like a girl when I got it and it would prove that I was born one and was supposed to be one.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes and no. One can simply identify as genderqueer, which is something of an umbrella term, and not wish to make any changes. I don't identify as 100% man 100% of the time, so I feel transman isn't fitting, but genderqueer is, however I am actually making an effort to transition just toward what exactly isn't quite defined. 

Edit: I'm the only female child in my family so female pronouns. I don't want to hurt my parents. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It means that, while I don't wish to fully transition to being a man 100% of the time, I do wish to transition to being more masculine. The difference between this and simply being masculine is that I make changes, like binding my chest, to do so. I also will have my breasts removed eventually.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mine has helped me a lot. He doesn't do anything questionable, either. He willingly sends people to orthopedic surgeons when needed. He performs x-rays and I have heard him tell people he can't help them. Most of my program included exercising the injured site, starting with passive stretching by a licensed massage therapist and then with help from a licensed personal trainer. He explains immediately in your first visit that he is not a medical doctor and if that makes you uncomfortable you are free to go elsewhere. My wife has PCOS and I speculated so for about six months. He met her once when she came with me and the next appointment he told me he thought she had it and that she needed to see a gynecological doctor immediately. He was right, obviously, and never tried to make me bring her for adjustments to help her. He stated that she needed hormonal treatment most likely in the form of birth control, which is right. I appreciate mine so much. He has been such a help in my life. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm transmasculine/genderqueer and currently identify as a lesbian. I'm married to a beautiful woman who, despite being 100% certain that she is gay, completely supports me and recognizes that top surgery is an inevitability and is fine with that. I know I will probably transition one day, if I can be sure it means not losing my family, but I know my wife will continue to identify as a lesbian and that is fine by me. Other transguys I know have dated girls that identify as lesbians and I have seen some relationships go from lesbian to straight. 

Have any of you guys had relationships like this? Would any of you begin a relationship with a woman who identified as a lesbian? I'm not looking for validation; I'm trying to start a conversation. </TEXT>

<TITLE> TIFU by learning to play "London Bridge" on the accordian. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-22 06:59:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As many fuck ups, this happened roughly 10 years ago. I was about 10 and needed to poop. It was midsummer and, living in the Poconos (Northeast Pennsylvania) it was quite hot out. At this time, there was no air conditioning in our house, so windows were all open. Knowing this was going to be a long poop, I decided to find a means of entertaining myself. 

The previous Christmas, my Grammy had gotten me and my brother a kid size accordian to share. We had barely touched it. I figured this was as good a time as any, so I made sure it would make sound, and headed to the bathroom.

I sat down and began trying different notes. I've always been pretty good with music; singing in church since age 3, clarinet since 8, so I could recognize notes by sound pretty easily. I figured out the beginning of the song and played it a few times while trying to figure out the next part.

It was going spectacularly and I was so excited to be able to share my learnings with my family. I went down stairs after I was done, and went out on the front porch to tell my parents the news.

I was greeted by my parents, brother, and several neighbors singing the song to me and then asked how my trip to the bathroom went. 

TL;DR London Bridge was falling down and embarrassment was falling up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I live in a semi-rural area. Girls get pregnant way too young here all the time. It's not Bible Belt area though, so it's not really a big deal to most people. It's a big deal to me, though. I'm going to college so I can one day support my family doing something that I love and am passionate about. I'm married to my partner, whom I've been with for four and a half years. All I want is a baby, but we can't have one because we are only 20 with no real way to afford one. Her sister, who is 18, is due in April and is getting everything handed to her for it. When we were 200 dollars short on rent because my job didn't pay me, they told us they knew this would happen and we were stupid to move out. But here we are, working hard at our goals, not having the one thing I really want, and it doesn't seem to do any good! We had no transportation for the last six weeks so we are yet another semester behind due to having to withdraw. We moved back in with my parents to save up toward our goals, but it doesn't matter because all of our money goes to household stuff anyway! I feel like I will never be able to have a family, which is all that I want. I know it's not a good time, and I know that we can't afford it and don't have enough room for a baby, but it's the only thing I want and it sucks that I feel punished for doing what's right. 

TL;DR: I want a child and can't have one because I can't afford it, but other people get to screw up and have just that. </TEXT>

While he was doing something in the car, I loaded the three of them into a shopping cart together. It was cold and I was tired of waiting for him, so I set off toward the store. I was a bit annoyed that he was taking so long, so, when he began yelling my name as I walked into the store with my cart load of dogs, I ignored him. This was where I fucked up. I turned around to see him yelling and continued into the store. That's when I saw the phones and people dressed in blue and yellow. I brought a cart full of dogs into Best Buy, the store next to PetSmart.

TL;DR: my boyfriend tried so save me from bringing my three dogs into Best Buy and failed. </TEXT>

He didn't bother to tape the ceiling, which he doesn't plan to paint, the trim is hideous with both black and gray on it because he taped it poorly and it just looks awful. He painted cabinets multiple colors and poorly at that without asking first. He has stuff all over and is taking a very long time to finish. Each night, and whenever he isn't painting, he puts his painting supplies in the bathtub so no one can bathe. You have to go through the kitchen to turn the heat on, and we live in the north east. My mom has a ton of medical problems and needs to have access to food, heat, and the bathroom. She doesn't want to say anything because she is grateful he is trying to help, but he is really causing problems.

The agency doesn't pay regularly and every two weeks, when my pay was due, I was crying because they somehow fucked me over. This caused me to lose my apartment. I have since quit the job. During my last week, the last week of January, the master cylinder in my car went so I have no brakes. I used my dad's truck for work, and emailed my professors that I couldn't be on campus. I have not gone to class in two weeks and am at risk for being dropped from 18 credits and losing my financial aid.

Last night, he comes home from work and starts yelling at me that the truck is damaged and I drove it last. We live in a college town and have several houses on our street that have college kids. One had a party Friday night. Apparently someone drunk ripped off his mirror. I said I had nothing to do with it, which I didn't, and he starts yelling that I wasted a ton of gas and abused my use of the truck. When I told him that I hadn't used it except to go a mile each night but that on Friday I had a ton to do to get my car fixed, and that I was at risk for failing out of school, he yelled at me that it wasn't his fault and that if I didn't run my car into the ground this wouldn't have happened. 

I told him the master cylinder went on a 10 year old car and there was nothing I could have done. I went  upstairs to grab my stuff to leave and he yelled "don't forget to slam your door" in the douchiest tone possible. 

As I went down the stairs, I said "I'm depressed and can't afford counseling and nobody in this house cares!" And then I left. I called my best friend crying and he came to hang out with me in a local Rite Aid. We tried to drive my car but the brakes are completely gone so my dad told me to take his truck, no reference to previous conversation. My mom hasn't mentioned it either. 

She had known that I was seeing a counselor at my college for about three months and knew it ended with the last semester. She hasn't mentioned except, when I told her I was going, to say that I was "stronger than that". She has known for five years that I have panic attacks but says that's I'm over dramatic. 

How it's a good thing: I have been not going to the hospital for help because I didn't want to disapoint anyone. They don't care. I'm free to go. 

TL;DR: life sucks, then what? </TEXT>

<TEXT> If I have a disagreement with my parents about anything, my wife takes their side. She claims she hates confrontation and is trying to avoid a fight but she just makes me livid. 

Today, for instance, my sick and physically disabled mother was struggling to breathe. When asked if she needed to go to the hospital, she made up an excuse about insurance and not wanting to go. My wife said wait until Monday and then if she isn't better she will go. I have class all day on Monday. My mom said wait until Tuesday. My wife agreed with her. 

Tl;dr: MY MOTHER CAN'T BREATHE AND MY WIFE AGREED TO PUT OFF A HOSPITAL VISIT. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have some really severe suicidal ideation, including a preferred method if I were to do so. However, I don't intend to. My understanding is that ER staff do not discriminate between suicidal ideation and suicidal intent. Is this accurate? Do I need to distinguish which I am experiencing?

My mom is physically disabled and rather sick. Since I am self admitting, can I leave if there is an emergency with my family? If so do I need to make this concern clear ahead of time?

I know that, at my hospital, if you have a baby or are sick, your spouse can stay with you overnight once in a while. Is this possible for this situation?

How much say over visitors do I get? My mom can't go and my dad won't so I would really rather be able to just say I don't want them there, but I do want my wife to be able to see me. Is this possible? 

Since I am planning ahead, am I not sick enough or is it not an emergency enough that I should go?

What I need is medication. If possible, I'd like to get a prescription and get out of there. I don't have health insurance or free clinics near me and I'm broke. I'd rather not get even more behind in school if I can avoid it. Can that happen?

Does my college have to be accommodating to this? I'm a first semester sophomore at a community college and I'm taking 18 credits, 3 of them writing intensive. Do they have to be lenient with me or can they fail me over it? Last semester I saw a counselor at my school and we were supposed to work on finding me real help but my insurance fell through. She diagnosed me with depression and anxiety but it's not on paper anywhere. She seemed scared and insistant that I get help ASAP but I really couldn't. Is that relevant or helpful to me?

When I get nervous, I smile, laugh, and joke. In high school when I tried to get help at the safe room, they didn't belive me because of it. I really can't control it. Will the hospital do the same thing?

Is there anything I'm not thinking of that may be important?

Edit: I'm 20 but married. Will I be with kids or adults or adolescents? I live in Pennsylvania for reference. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have diagnosed clinical depression and anxiety and have for almost a decade. For me, that means insomnia and not caring about myself at all. Typically, an adult can bounce back and at least bother to do the bare minimum. I was 11 or 12, though, and not caring developed into terrible habits, that, at 20, I'm still struggling to kick. 

When I joined reddit a bit over a year ago, and came across SCA, I subscribed because I've always been lucky to have great skin, so I figured I might enjoy learning to actually wash my face. It took another nine months or so before I actually used it, but hey, I did eventually. 

Since then, I've started to remember to brush my teeth regularly. I know, gross, but being young and depressed is making bad choices. I've also started to drink water almost exclusively. I'm chubby, by like a lot, and have always been the kind of kid to cut gym class and hang out somewhere else, even if somewhere else is a bathroom. I've started using my college fitness center by choice. 

SCA has really helped me make some positive changes in my life, and I thank all of you for that. </TEXT>

It doesn't seem to help my depression like people claim it will, but physically its not bad and I even find myself enjoying after years of cutting gym in high school. It's something at least. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Married: 1 month, 10 days.

Number of times we've had sex: 17.

Highlights: 10 were in the first week of being married. 

On our wedding night, you fell asleep with my nipple in your mouth, throwing me into a panic attack. I still count that time. 

You've gone down on me once, and you weren't happy about it. 

I love you but dammit baby you're supposed to want to have sex with your new wife. If we did the penny jar first year thing, we couldn't buy a McChicken at the end of the year.


Edit: thank you guys for being so supportive. I was in a bad spot last night when I posted this. I have diagnosed depression and anxiety and one of my symptoms when I get seriously upset is that I can't sleep, which manifested into this. My wife and I (yes, we're lesbians for those of you who expressed confusion) communicate endlessly. She has a lower sex drive than me and I need to get over it. Last night I was upset because, I after I went down on her and then got her off a second time, she had no interest in either going down on me or otherwise doing what I like. We have discussed it multiple times and I need to learn to accept it. Prior to getting married we averaged 3 to 4 times every week. Our wedding week ramped it up and I'm just hating the slow down. She has PCOS so hormone stuff is totally wacky meaning her libido is, too, but it sucks to be 20 and have her have a low sex drive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have what my best friend, who's a transguy, and I call "trans memories" which are memories from childhood that, if it happened now, you would know that you were trans*. For me, these include being seven and trying to use a toilet paper roll as an STP; being 10 and seeing the "Transitions" episode of Law and Order: SVU and crying because I thought my parents must have had me surgically made into a girl when I was born. Also during my childhood, I had plenty of experience being reminded that my mom knew when she found out she was pregnant with me that I would be a healthy girl because God didn't give her 16 years of not being able to get pregnant to give her another boy (I have two older adopted brothers and my parents fostered over 40 boys in the mid 80s). Whenever I wear my binder, which I have been a lot lately thanks to you guys giving me advice on it, she makes comments about how I look deformed and says that I must be binding in the most disgusted voice. I'm out to her as a butch lesbian, but when I came out she told me I had to wait until 10 years after she was dead if I was going to become a guy. She accepts other transpeople she just doesn't want it for me. It's hard. I'm just starting to feel better in my skin and she makes fun of me... I can't be out to her. It would kill her. She's physically disabled with a whole list of medical problems. It just sucks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I work 17.5 hours every week, I have 18 credit hours this semester, I take care of my disabled mom and I need to do well this semester to graduate on time. I transport my wife to and from her job, too. My dad expects me to do everything. Today he told me brother (who does nothing. I repeat, nothing at all. He plays video games and sponges off of my family and his girlfriend. He's almost 19.) To tell me I had to get the balance of his debit card. They are both more than capable and I already do so much else and I didn't want to so I refused. He started harassing me about how I eat off the money so I can do it. He gets my food almost never. 

My wife and I both work. If we don't have enough after bills, my mom will get us food. I left. I wanted a cigarette so fucking bad but I'm trying not to smoke this year. Also, I don't have any money to buy a pack with. I want to die so bad. It's always little bullshit like this, but it adds up. It sounds so fucking stupid that this makes me feel this way. 

I'm quitting my job in 2 weeks because they often don't bother to pay me and I have to wait forever for my money. That's why my wife and I live with my parents. I feel like a goddamn failure. I'm 20, married, doing well enough for me in school (I have a 3.08) and I love my job but they don't pay me so I have to live at home. It fucking sucks. I know I won't kill myself. I have too much responsibility to kill myself. One day it will get better. But right now it fucking sucks. 


My school councilor diagnosed me with depression and anxiety but she can't really do anything to help. I don't have money for a doctor or insurance so I'm just fucking stuck. I can't check out of life for a week to get help because of all the fucking responsibility. I'm sorry for the wall of text. I just sort of needed to vent and all.

Edit: You guys are so great. I don't have a response right now for each of you, but know that you help me greatly. I ended up hanging out with a friend tonight and walking around the mall locally. I don't know if I'll go to the hospital any time soon, honestly. My wife won't have a way to get to and from school without me. That's not fair to her. Honestly, I'm scared. We haven't slept apart for more than one night since I was like 16. I don't want to be without her for that long.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My job doesn't pay me when or what or how they're supposed to and it's really contributed to my mounting depression and anxiety. 

In high school, I started the Gay Straight Alliance for my school. Today I found out that my successor's successor, whom I selected for the role, got into her dream school with a full merit scholarship strongly because of her role as President of the GSA. She Facebook messaged me and thanked me for giving her the opportunity to reach this goal. 

It helped me to realize that I have a positive impact on people's lives and gave me the boost I needed to send this email. I don't even know if the place is hiring, but I tried, and for that I'm proud of myself. 

Today was a good day, Reddit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm pretty upset for good reason and sitting in a McDonald's typing this, so sorry if it's all jumbled and fucked up.

We recently moved back in with my parents because my job doesn't like to pay me correctly and we couldn't keep up with our rent. My 18 year old brother is prince of the mother fucking earth. He does whatever the fuck he wants, including, tonight, when he came in the bathroom while I was showering and turned on the sink water and started flipping out and calling me names because I let his stupid ass dog in his room so it wouldn't shit on my goddamn flood. Big surprise, the fucking puppy shit on the floor. He should have taken the fucking dog out or put it in it's crate if he wasn't going to be able to take it out. I told him to turn the water off because the family dog had just puked all over me and I was trying to get cleaned off. He wouldn't. I told him to get the fuck out of the bathroom. He said "Or what, you'll sit on me?" 

I ran to my room and got dressed. I went downstairs and told my parents that SOMETHING needs to be done about their goddamn hellion. My dad said "I hate to say it, but I think it's time you find a place to live." My wife and I left and came to this McDonald's. I don't know what the fuck to do from here. We have no money, about 200$ in food stamps and a quarter of a tank of gas. I have to work tomorrow and I know they won't fucking pay me anyway. We just finished the last day of our semester of college, so switching to dorming isn't possible right now. I don't know what to do. 

If you're just commenting to tell me I'm awful, please, save it.

<TITLE> My (20F) wife's (20F), married 4 days, together 4 years, mother (40F) and other family members ignored me during the last three get togethers, including our wedding. </TITLE>

<TEXT> Faux Thanksgiving was the Tuesday after the normal holiday; all of the talk was about her 18 year old, single, uneducated, unemployed, knocked up sister. That's fine. It was all super positive and everyone (except those of us with brains) is excited for her. My wife's aunt and uncle were there. They didn't say hello to me and only spoke to me to show me a picture of their dog. They also walked past me to say goodbye to others and didn't acknowledge me again. Then, we found out, her mother and said knocked up sister started shit talking us as soon as we left. 

Her mother originally did not intend to come to our wedding. After she was called out on it, she decided she would show up. Knocked up sister had an appointment and didn't show up. Mother made fun of our venue, made fun of my wife's outfit and feet, and complained that it was too small of a wedding. She left as soon as possible, no congratulations were offered and she texted later asking for her Crock Pot back since she forgot it. She owes my wife 15 dollars for a Mary Kay item and we haven't seen the money despite asking several times and really needing the money, and I felt it was ballsy to ask for it back when she owes us.

Last night was the family Christmas party. The only people who said hello to me were my MIL's ex roomate who felt awkward that everyone was ignoring me and my wife's other aunt. The pregnant sister tried to push me down some stairs and everyone else pretty much just ignored me. My wife was said hello to, I was just ignored.

My wife also has 3 younger sisters; they're 15, 15, and 13. I went all out on gifts for them. They're great kids and we get along great. I do not feel at all motivated or obligated to get gifts for the mother or other sister for Christmas. I need my money more. I am sick of going to things like this to be treated like shit. I hate it.

I unsubscribed from a lot of the defaults with the whole "bro culture" thing going on and am hoping it will help, since I let the comments and what not affect me too much. If it doesn't help, I'm probably going to leave reddit for a while, or at least delete the app from my phone, because for the last year, my depression has gotten worse and the main change has been my use of reddit that has gone up drastically, especially over the last several months.

Sometimes the littles play together and get into mischief. Does that happen for anyone else? It's also 100% non sexual. We're actually both turned off by the idea of including littles in sexual stuff. Is that at all common? I read the FAQ but I guess I'm a little confused about if we qualify? </TEXT>

She loves to tell bedtime stories before we go to sleep, which usually either center around fairies, princesses, or horses. She is obsessed with horses, but without a real desire to own one.

It's the cutest thing in the world. I can't wait for us to get married in a little over a week. I hope she never grows up. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My girlfriend and I had been getting pretty heavy before she left for work. We had agreed that, when she got home, sexy times were to be had. Since we are currently living with my parents, they have to be sort of planned. 

Being a good girlfriend, I decided to wash our collection while I was in the shower, and left them out to dry on her towel, with it folded over. The family dog comes in, and, being the good dog that she is, starts snuggling me. When my girlfriend got home, I had shown her that I washed everything, so the towel was folded up, and everything was exposed.

Now I'm sure plenty of you are thinking that my dog grabbed one and brought it to my mom. That, happily, is not what happened. My brother came in my room to see if I wanted him to get the dog. After he left, I glanced over at the dog, and, between her and I, was a towel covered in sex toys. My brother just left and I'm hoping he decides to avoid talking to me until he forgets about this.

TL;DR I washed my sex toys then put them on display for my brother. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am a full time student. I am extremely intelligent, as awkward as it is for me to proclaim that. My GPA is falling fast.

I am the only daughter and despite the fact that my father is still married to and lives with my mom, I am the one primarily if not soley responsible for her care now that she is disabled. No one else will do anything for her but me.

I work as a companion to a man with Down Syndrome. I have for almost a year and a half. I go out of my way to better his life. No raise or even a thank you. I work until 10 most Fridays with a 10 hour day so he can belong to a bowling league and I get no praise. The paperwork tripled and I can't keep up with it and everything else and I haven't been paid my hours in 2 months and my gas reimbursement in 3 and a half. 

I am so burnt out.

Edit: I think I misexplained. I haven't been paid because I can't keep up with the paper work required to get my pay. I have to write the equivalent of a one page essay on the guy every night, plus the math for the mileage, and I just can't keep up. I was promised it would decrease after I complained, but it hasn't. It's my fault I haven't been paid. </TEXT>

This a picture of my stuffed doll, Baby. I got her 20 years ago for my first Christmas. She originally had an attached blanket on her wrist (left I believe) that was cut off from being holey when I was a kid. My understanding is that she was a FisherPrice doll that came in blue, yellow, or, like mine, pink terrycloth. Clearly, she has grown tattered over the years. I am hoping to be able to purchase another one. I have tried various searches over the last several years, and if you have any direction to offer, please feel free. Thank you. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Last night, I made love to a woman for the first time. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-05 23:51:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have been out for almost six years. I have been with my partner for over four. Last night, though we've had sex, even great sex, before, was the first time I've ever truly made love to a woman.

For the first time, I didn't emotionally compare it to what my expectations of sex with a man are. For one, they're unrealistic as I've never had sex with a man, and for two, it is so stupid to try to compare sex with a woman to sex with a man.

For the first time, I didn't have to fantasize to orgasm. Generally, I think about something I've read or watched, not really filling myself or my partner into any of the roles. It also generally involves a man. Last night, I didn't. When I tried to in order to finish faster, it made it more difficult. I didn't have to think at all; just feel.

For the first time, I was completely satisfied after I finished. I didn't really crave anything else. Typically, after my partner has gone to sleep, I will get myself off one more time before I fall asleep. Last night I had no desire to do that.

For the first time, I didn't concentrate on what might be best for her while she's touching me. I paid attention to me, since it was my "turn" anyway. I generally do whatever it takes to finish fast for her so she isn't left spending a million years on me. Last night, I just cared about what felt good and let myself enjoy it.

We discussed it afterword, and she felt the same way. She is the only woman I've ever dated, though, since I'm not even 20 and we've been together so long, it isn't that surprising. I'm the only woman she has ever dated. I guess there is still a bit of a learning curve, but I'm really looking forward to experiencing this and more again.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My girlfriend has three little sisters; twin 15yo and the other will be 14 in the beginning of January. The twins have been asking my advice on skin care because mine is flawless (THANK YOU FOR TEACHING ME!) and they both have acne rather bad. The younger one has great skin but care isn't a bad thing and she's a copycat and would love it. Now, about their skin.

Twins; both girls have normal to oily skin, leaning slightly more toward oily. Both have acne, primarily in the form of white heads and some scarring due to their mother doing extractions. They are allergic to salicylic acid. Their goals are to clear up acne and my goal for them is to teach them the importance of skin care even when your skin is clear. Their skin is the opposite of mine so I don't really know what they need. They are on hormonal birth control to help control their acne as well.

Younger sister; normal skin that is clear with minor breakouts now and then but nothing extreme. Also allergic to salicylic acid, so my routine goes out the window dispite having very similar skin. She desires to prevent breakouts and be like her sisters. 

If you have specific product recommendations or anything to avoid, please, any advice helps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My girlfriend is the oldest of five girls and was born to her mother when her mother and father were 19. She has a very poor relationship with her father and a so-so one with her mother. Her three youngest sisters and her get along great, but her other sister, the only one with the same father as my girlfriend, has had issues with my girlfriend since we got together. She has actively tried to ruin our relationship and give my girlfriend's parents false information about me to get them to hate me as well. It worked with her father.

Tonight, we went to dinner at her mom's for the first time in over six months. Her mother was insistent that my girlfriend get into contact with her sister. My girlfriend has been trying to talk to her sister, but her sister has no interest as, this summer, when her sister got "engaged" to a man she has known for 2 months and been dating for one, my girlfriend texted her asking exactly how long they had been together. We found out about her engagement via Facebook. Her mother, after my girlfriend's explanation, showed my girlfriend ultrasound pictures with sister's name on them. She is due in April.

My girlfriend tried to contact her sister through call and text, she ignored the texts and literally made sounds like she had no signal on the phone. She intentionally went to her friend's house so she wouldn't see us. Also, she and the "fiance" broke up and she is moving 3 hours away to live with their dad next week.

My girlfriend wants to be involved, but was asked not to let on that she knew. She wants to see her before she leaves as well. We have no idea what she should do.

**tl;dr**: Sister is pregnant and hiding it and won't talk to us and is moving away in a week. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ma'am,
You passed so well that after walking away from you my girlfriend and I commented to each other on it. I assure you no one else was reading you. But I did. I read you when we made eye contact and you looked terrified that you thought I knew. It wasn't your height, even though you stood several inches above my 5'5". It wasn't your face, which was just as feminine as any other lady's face. It was your lack of confidence and fear that made me see any other indicators. I wanted in that moment so badly to hug you and tell you it was all okay and not to be so worried. Walmart at midnight may not be the safest place, but it also isn't the worst. No one even knew. You were just as safe as all other women in that store were and I wish there had been a way for me to communicate that to you. I hope my subtle smile and aversion of my eyes after our eye contact didn't further freighten you or make you think you didn't pass. I am proud of you for being yourself and presenting in public. I hope youbhave the courage to do it again, and maybe next time, if I see you, I'll have a better way to show you that I support you. 

Signed, 
The Lesbian from 2368. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We were riding in the car chatting about how, the previous night, she wanted me to cuddle her because she was feeling sick and I wanted sex because I was feeling horny. In order to not bother her, I opted to watch porn when she fell asleep. All in good fun, she was ribbing me about the fact that I hate her because I didn't cuddle her. I corrected her and said that I didn't cuddle her because I hate her is what she meant. Then, Reddit, I fucked up. I said "I don't hate you because you're fat, you're fat because I hate you." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sorry if this isn't allowed but I didn't know where else to ask. I work as a companion to a 29 year old man with Down Syndrome. Socially amd emotionally, I'd guess he's between 12 and 14, but he is illiterate to the point of not knowing the alphabet.  

We have rules about his cell phone. He isn't to call me before 7:50 am ever. Last week we added the rules that on Mondays I will call him at 10am to chat since I have off and don't want to be up that early and if he needs to call and I don't pick up, he calls once and I will call back.

In July we had a big issue because he called me at 6:30 in the morning. He hasn't been allowed to visit with some questionable friends since. Last Monday, he called at 7:30, leading to the establishment of the additional cell phone rules. 

Yesterday morning, while he knew I was on vacation, he called me four times between 7:52 am and 9:30 am. I chose not to call him because he gave up that privilege when he broke the rules. We spoke about it briefly this morning while I drove him to work and he says he won't do it again but I know he will and, rather than apologizing for his actions, he apologized for the fact that I was upset with him. 

What can I do to help set some better, stronger boundaries and get him to stick to them? Games and stuff are fine as long as they aren't geared at two year olds or overly wordy. Thank you so much! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have lived there a year and paid a lot of late fees because my job keeps witholding and fucking with my pay. I couldn't save at all because I was paying sometimes 40 a month extra in late fees because of my job. I have also recieved three 10 day eviction notices. The first was for being 10 days late, the second for seven, the third for 2. I had never missed a payment, only paid late. My landlord recently broke my car window and has done nothing toward paying for it. I only have until 10/15 left in the lease and last rent is due 9/15. The entire length of my tenancy the management company has been shady and rude and I don't believe I will see a dime of ny security despite making no damage. I am not worried about future tenancy as I will be living with my parents for some time from then on and can use them to get a new apartment down the road if need be. 

What will happen if I don't pay? </TEXT>

<TEXT> We have been together just shy of four years. She has PCOS and has yet to find a perfect birth control to treat it. The current one has her extremely nasty and she claims depressed but I don't know. 

Last night, I got stuck late at work and therefore late to pick her up. She knows I am working on getting a raise. She called my mother and they each called me several times trying to find me. The exact situation happened a week ago. I told her that she is mauling me and she got pissed at me for worrying her.

She will not get her driver's license, leaving me responsible for transportation of both of us.

My mom is disabled and doesn't socialize much except with me and my girlfriend. My girlfriend often ignores her in favor of reading books despite the fact that my mom has bent over backwards for her. (Buying work uniforms, letting her move in at 17, etc).

I wake up early in the morning for work and she works second shift. I spend free time with my mom as I only get one and her poor health means I need to treasure the time I get. She always complains about being tired and wanting to go home when she gets far more sleep than I. 

We used to be very sexual. We would have sex twice a day everyday the whole first summer we were dating. We haven't had sex in a month. I ask and get either maybe or we'll see or I'm tired. I hate being rejected. Mostly I hate when she spends the day trying to grope me and make out with me AT MY MOMS HOUSE and then sleeps when we get home.

We are going away in October for our 4th anniversary. I took a day and a half off work for it already. She has yet to request it. I don't even know if I want to go. We were going to announce our engagement after this trip. I don't know if I want to promise another week never mind the rest of my life.

She promised we wouldn't go to her abusive father's wedding. (He abused us both when we lived with him briefly.) Then she told them we would. Now we aren't because it's the weekend before our anniversary and she can't get two weekends in a row off. She still hasn't told him she isn't going to attend. 

I really do love this girl. We have been together since high school. I just don't know where to go from here.

TL;DR girlfriend is being unusually psycho and I don't want to stay but I don't want to leave either. </TEXT>

<TEXT> On /r/parenting, people talk about cosleeping in a positive way. We know cosleeping is dangerous. Babies get rolled on, and babies roll or fall of beds. Having a baby in bed also destroys intimacy in the parents' relationship. It is hard to get a kid to stay out of your bed anyway. If you let them for a long time then stop them, it'll be thay much harder later, further destroying intimacy. Basinets are not a huge inconvenience. Keep it by your bed to make feeding easy. They are small enough that they fit nearly anywhere. There are also basinets that get attached to the bed. Cosleeping should always be discouraged and absolutely never encouraged. CMV. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> On October 10th we will be together for four years. Their wedding is October 4th. 

They got married already and are now having a big wedding. They waited two months before accidentally telling my partner that they got married. 

They have out right stated that they dislike me and that our relationship is invalid. We aren't sure if it is because I am female or if it is personal.

It is a semi themed wedding. My partner is to dress for the theme while I am not.

Despite the fact that we have been together two years longer than them, our invitation was addressed to my partner and guest. They know my name.

Are we being petty or is this just icing on the rude cake that is her parents?

<TEXT> I am overweight, hefty, whatever you prefer. I got an exercise trampoline to help change that. After having been swimming a lot lately and generally eating better, I decided to jump on it today, not for the first time. I jumped twice and metal flew from the side and scared the hell out of my cats. 

TL DR too fat to work out, not fat enough to be confined to a bed.

Edit: Thank you all so much for being encouraging! I start my next semester of college on August 25th and since we have a new campus, I get access to a great gym facility that I plan to use. I'm going to keep at it and maybe be able to show you guys some before and after in a few months.  </TEXT>

My brother and father are willing to install the parts, I just can't afford them right now. I am on food stamps and extremely hard up. If you can find the parts for the car (1999 Plymouth Neon) cheaper and wish to send me those, feel free. Anything at all helps. PM for shipping info if interested.

<TITLE> CMV: Non stealth preoperative transwomen do not belong in women only spaces. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A few bad apples can spoil the whole bunch. The reason for not wanting them to be there in the first place is people who choose to expose their non female genitals in what is supposed to be a female space. Take Mich Fest for example. Many women there are victims of violent sexual assault. They are choosing to be in a space they feel is safer. As a women only space they should not have to worry about seeing male genitals. Pre op stealth women would not want to be outed and so would be extremely unlikely to even accidentally expose themselves. Post op transwomen have no.male genitals to show. In order to keep people more comfortable, a female space should be just that. People who are male do not belong their if they risk hurting female women even emotionally. 

Disclaimer: I am not debating whether or not trans women are women. They without a doubt are regardless of stage of transition. The issue is whether or not out transwomen who are pre op or non op belong in a space meant for females to feel safe. 

TL DR a penis free zone is a penis free zone. Cmv. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is a reason you aren't legally allowed in Central Park after dark. If you choose to go in anyway and are raped/mugged/attacked/murdered, you knew the risk of going into the Park.

We all know that date rapes happen. If you leave your drink completely unattended and then choose to drink from it again, you are partially responsible as you are the one who chose to put something rather unknown into your body.

Bullies currently heavily target out gay kids. If you "pass" for straight and choose to be out in school, in part, you brought on the harassment. You knew the risks.

I know that breaking the law doesn't give others a right to harm you nor does making any other potentially poor choice, but if you know the risks and follow through anyway, you aren't totally innocent. 

TL;DR: choices have consequences. CMV. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been with my girlfriend and out as a lesbian for almost four years. A friend of ours invited us (well actually she told us we were going not asked) to a picnic with her family this weekend. We were happy to go until she informed me and my girlfriend we can "be out just don't hug or kiss or touch and don't act like you are dating". She askef my gf if she is okay wiyh it and my gf is a bit of pushover and was like oh yeah sure. However I am pissed. I went through a shit ton of crap for the right to be out. Like I had food thrown at me and was slammed into lockers and walls and just about pushed down the damn stairs. This girl knows all of this and yet she had basically told me to hide it. I cannot believe it. I have been nothing but supportive of her (she is a lesbian) and my girlfriend and I know how to behave. But for us to not be allowed to hold hands or anything is insulting. Now we are stuck going to this picnic and I don't know what to do. Am I overreacting? Should I still go?

TL DR: been out for 4 years. Friend wants my gf and me to hide us being a couple and gay for a picnic. Advice? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I work split shift for between five and eight hours Tuesday through Friday and tutor a kid when it fits with my work schedule. My partner works around 15 hours a week at a restaurant on weekends with extra shifts sprinkled in. Since the semester is over, we have a lot more free time. I desire to get things done. We need to be finding ways to make more money so we can get out of our really shitty financial situation (a near eviction, no car insurance, power over 1000 dollars late and due to be shut off, no food, etc.). I work from 8 to 830 every morning. She usually comes with me. Lately, she has been either staying in bed, or, like right now, going back to bed. She went to bed at about 1 this morning so it isn't like she should be exhausted. She knows I don't want to mess up my extremely sensitive sleep schedule. She insists I lay in bed next to her until she gets up at some point between 10 and 11. She gets mad at me if I go to the bathroom. I really love her and want to marry this girl. I just hate spending my days in bed not even asleep. I either read or go on reddit and facebook all morning.

TL;DR: Life ain't nothin but sleeping girls and no money. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If it pertains, I live in Monroe county.

My girlfriend and I have lived in our apartment for 5 months as of March 15th. In that time, we have been late with payment because of waiting on paychecks but have always paid the 5 dollars per day charge. 

I work as a companion to a man with Down Syndrome. He had been in the hospital, so I couldn't get papers signed, so I couldn't get paid. My pay will be in on April 5th. I will be getting about 700 dollars. Our rent is 675. I made a partial payment the day after the rent was due this month of 150 dollars. My girlfriend lost her job and got a new one and had been waiting on new pay checks to come. Today, March 25, we came home to a 10 day eviction notice. Our lease does state that habitual late payment can result in eviction. When we made the partial payment at the real estate agency the lease is through, we explained the scenario and asked to be notofoed if there would be an issue. No one notified us until now. Any and all advice is of help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, but you girls always answer stuff well.

Back ground on us: I am 19, she will be 20 in early April. We have been together 3.5 years. 

Background on Dad: He has been married to 4 different women. He married my girlfriend's mom, divorced her after about two years, ran away to Vegas to marry wife number 2, then had a big Catholic wedding a year later. Divorced wife 2, married wife 3. Married wife number 2 AGAIN in a secret wedding, and is now having another big wedding to her.

Background on my girlfriend and her dad's relationship: he left when she was 2. He saw her maybe once a year until she was 16. Then, like 2 or 3 times a year. She and I lived with him for 7 months until he threw us out to move in with wife #2 in her state, 2 hours away. He has since tried to force her to leave me and move im with him and force them to only spend time together despite her refusal since he is verbally abusive and controlling. 

He hates me. We are both expected to attend this wedding, and the wife wants my girlfriend to be a bridesmaid, despite only having seen her 4 times since she was 4. My girlfriend doesn't want to go. I really don't want to go. Do you guys think we are obligated? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm FAAB. I have identified as genderqueer leaning male for almost 5 years now. 

From when I was a kid, I have distinct what I call "trans memories". For one thing, I remember trying to make an STP out of a toilet paper roll. I also remember trying to always have a reason to use the men's room. When I first saw the SVU Episode "Transitions", I cried because I thought that my parents had gotten me a sex change when I was a baby and wondering why they couldn't just love me as the baby boy I assumed I had been born as. 

I'm fairly certain that I am FtM. My family would not accept it. We've already discussed it. My girlfriend says that she would be very much okay with, but I don't think she would be okay with any bodily changes.

I'm wondering if, if I use Androgel, I can gain all of the effects besides facial hair. My family history is very limited body hair growth. My mom's brother's didn't grow facial hair until their thirties and it was then still very limited. My legs only need shaving once a month or less, as it grows so sparingly. Also, how much would my voice change most likely? </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I last left you guys, all was going rather swell. Sadly, since then, everything as fallen apart. Moxie, one of the girls, ate through most of the cardboard I used to make the split. I tried, since it had been a while with no fighting, to introduce them directly, and fighting immediately ensued. I haven't had the time since to work on making them a better divider, but once I do get some time, I'll be sure to let you all know. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I posted yesterday about introducing my kids with a homemade split cage. They initially fought (or tried) through the screen, but have since gone to seeming to almost ignore eachother. I am switching their sides periodically so they learn the scents, but I want to wait until they are sleeping side by side for a week before I put them all the way together since my boy is so young.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I want to breed some gerbils. I love mine, but I know that they will eventually die, so I want a little piece of them left. Also, some friends have said that they want gerbils, and would be good gerbil parents. I have homes lined up, and I am willing to keep any that don't get homed. 

I recently got a baby gerbil, I think about 1-2 months old. He is a little boy, he is solid very dark grey. I also have a pair of girls. One is blonde and and the other is grey and white. They are each in half of a split cage I made.

I used heavy cardboard wrapping paper tubes and window screen materials to make a divider. They can't seem to get through it. 

Wish me luck on this bonding! </TEXT>

<TITLE> How can I get my male to be nicer? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-11-09 18:54:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have two female gerbils named Moxie and Roxie that I've had for about 9 months. I also have a little guy named Remy. I've had him for about a month. So far, he has bit me to the point of leaving a scar once, he has made Roxie bleed, and he has bit me hard a second time. They live in separate cages, but I want to breed them, so in a completely open cage without bedding, I was introducing him to Roxie. He doesn't seem to fight with Moxie as much. I got them from separate pet stores, no chance of relation.

I have tried placing their cages side by side, since Moxie is an escape artist, I don't want to risk her getting into his half if I were to split cage them. I have bought Remy special presents, including his own ball, a track to run it on, special treats, and various types of chew toys. He is still very shy and very nasty. 

How can I get him to be nicer?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First ever post on reddit. 

When I was about 3 or 4, (I don't remember the first time) a neighbor kid of mine who was two years older, used to coerce me into doing inappropriate things with him. These started out just as him getting me to kiss him, and then lead to French-kissing, and further to eventually kissing and licking his genitals. He would tell me that if I told he would never talk to me again, and we were best friends. He also would say that if I didn't do what he wanted, he would tell his mom I started it or that I wasn't allowed in his rec room anymore. He had a captains bed, and, in my strongest memory, we were "hiding" in the part that goes near the wall while my brother played Nintendo 64 in the rest of the room.

I have always been aware of what happened to me as a kid. It was just the other day though that someone actually told me that it was abuse. I always pretty much just thought that it was just "kids being kids" or that I was willing. 

I must have been pretty young when it started, because I remember, very vaguely, my dad telling me that if anyone touched me or made me touch them, to tell him. I can remember at that moment wondering if the other kid counted, but I knew the other kid said not to tell.

Later in my life, when I was 13, there was a girl who I had been friends with for my entire life. She was 12. We knew we weren't supposed to, but we put on a DVD, I think it was American Pie, and she decided that we should try "stuff". The next day, for her birthday party, she told me that she told her other friend about all of it, and that her friend then wanted to join because they had done it before. I was pretty much terrified from the previous night, and I certainly didn't want her friend to know, never mind join. However, a few months later, I willingly fooled around with her, (the girl, not her friend), so I don't know if this can really count for anything, since I went back for more. 

I also recently realized that I have a large majority of "symptoms" per se of abused people. I have severe depression, despite the fact that I have a pretty good life. I am incredibly anxious all the time. I have been to the point of suicide more than once. 

What I want to know is, now that I am 18, can I get therapy without insurance? I live in PA. Also, does the second thing count for anything other than stupidity?  </TEXT>
