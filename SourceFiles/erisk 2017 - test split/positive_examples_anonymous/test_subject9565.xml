<TITLE> So someone asked about my father today... </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just came home from work and a neighbour that I never met before  wanted to speak with me. He asked where has my father been because he noticed that he hasn't seen him in a while. My father died 7 months today from a four year battle with pancreatic cancer. This is the first time when someone asked where my father was and wasn't aware of his passing. It's a really horrible feeling, I've been dealing with his loss in a healthy way (getting help , finding hobbies etc), but it made me miss my dad more. The neighbour though told me when he first moved onto the street, my dad was one of the first people to greet him, it made me smile. Sometimes, curses can turn into blessings!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm so sorry for your loss. I just lost my father last December and my stupid cousin was on snap chat while we were at the cemetery and apparently took a picture. There are a lot of shmucks (idiots) out there. Since my dad's passing, I realized who were my friends and who arent. I stopped being in touch with one friend because she wouldn't seek help with her fathers death and kept on guilt tripping people and wanted attention. You are upset and honestly it's not worth it. Focus on yourself and you should find yourself new friends   </TEXT>

I stopped being friends with her because i lost my father just a few months after to cancer. She freaked out on my friend because she told her she needed help because every time the word heart or attack came up she would bring it up that it reminded her of dads death so  i knew i had to get away.

<TEXT> Death is apart of life, everything eventually dies from plants, animals and humans. No one knows what to say until they are the ones experiencing it.  Everyone deals with it eventually, but unfortunately, some deal with death earlier than others. My father died recently on December 8, 2014 from a 4 year battle with pancreatic cancer. Besides my father being diagnosed with cancer 4 years ago in 2010, this was also the hardest day of my life. But, I can sit and cry for years on how my dad was taken away from me at the age of 21 and how he won't be there for my birthdays or my graduation in 2 years or if I walk down the aisle. My father was the one who cheered me on with school, went on ski trips with, bought technology with (phones, printers) and went to Tim Hortons so he could visit a camping store nearby. My father wasn't my best friend, but he was my mentor who I looked up to and who was my light to my darkness. I've been battling depression for a year now and it's hard, but knowing my father would want me to continue my life as it was before he died and succeed. I want to make my father proud and I will.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm very sorry, I recently just lost my father after a 4 year battle with cancer. It is not easy what you are going through, its mentally, emotionally exhausting. Every day I wish my father would walk through the door because my dad was always a fighter and when he passed it still hasn't hit me. I know that he is in a better place because seeing him in the hospital unconscious killed me. You need to associate yourself with people who will be there for you. This will be a time where you see who your real friends are. I would also recommend you see a professional, although you may think you don't need it. There's nothing wrong expressing your feelings to a professional. I like my social worker, she tells me I'm awesome.

<TITLE> Dear Professor, Mental Health is not a problem </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-20 22:15:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Im sitting in class listening to my professor repeatedly say mental health problems and this is not the first time I disagreed with a teacher's choice of words. I have a hearing loss and instead of the teacher saying that I have a hearing loss, she decided to use my least favourite words hearing problems.  Im trying so hard not to raise my hand as well as to rebuttal the topic. I have depression and anxiety which makes my life sometimes a little bit complicated, but I do not see it as a problem. There is a lot of stigma revolving mental health and as for someone who is trying to educate us, using problem and mental health in the same sentence is doing more harm than good. A problem is defined as something to fix and mental health cannot be fixed. There is medication as well as therapies to help assist with mental health to make it easier for the person, but it doesnt always help. The reason Im writing this is because mental health is not a problem and by saying that makes it seem that I as well as the many others have something that needs to be taken away. The topic Mental Health has been brought up in many conversations, advertisements and media outlets, but there needs to be a CHANGE on how WE talk about mental health.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm currently in the washroom on the floor while writing this so im sorry if nothimg makez sense. After my dad battling cancer for four years and since September it has been downhill it's hard to know how you are going to feel when you are actually in that position.  It sucks big time being in a room surrounded with people crying. I hate it and I feel so overwhelmed because it happened in a snap of fingers. It sucks and I have exams starting tomorrow. I'm going to stay strong because my dad would want that for me. 

I believe in this saying with every curse there is a blessing. 

Because of the decline of my dad's health I matured and now I can cook and be more independent.  

I needed to vent 

Thanks </TEXT>

<TEXT> My dad has a rare form of pancreatic cancer (Steve Jobs had it) since Sept 2010. My dad still worked and was able to live his life besides the one set back.  Before my dad went to the hospital, I couldn't bake and cook for my life. I relied a lot on my mothers cooking. Things went for a turn for the worst when he went to the hospital Canadian Thanksgiving weekend and has been ever since. We found out the cancer is terminal since there is no cure. The radiation is just to slow it down so its a matter of when.   Since my mom is rarely home for dinner I found a new passion for baking/cooking. It is so therapeutic for me. Now I can bake from cookies to apple cakes as well as cook chicken  fish. I don't know how I cope with everything but I'm so thankful I found baking. I love seeing the smiles of peoples faces when I give to to them. I don't eat a lot of my baked goods because I want to give it to others and make their day because I know it would make mine. I'm writing this because these past few months have been difficult and not easy with keeping up with school but if you or anyone is in a similar situtation. Finding something to distract you for a bit and make you happy even for a minute can make a difference and make things a tad bit easier! Plus Taylor Swift since her album came at a perfect time. Going in the car and blasting her music (been a fan since 06) is one of my favourite things about my day.

FYI: do have depression and last year was VERY difficult for me because I started to have suicidal thoughts. But baking/movies help me! I do have friends I don't have many but I got a good group of people.  </TEXT>

Find something to  help you through this difficult time- I bake, watch movies and I cook. I also like to humour people so all those help me through it. You are not alone. I'm so sorry.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is me and his first relationship! Me and Bob (fake name) were dating for 4 months. My father is in the hospital and my dad cancer is not treatable. He has a rare form of pancreatic cancer the one that Steve Jobs had. I went to a hospital 2 hours away from home because my dad has a good relationship with them for the past four years and they specialize in his type of cancer.  My friends have been texting more than my then boyfriend and for 3 days he did not text me. He did say if I need to talk to him, he's there but i was pissed because for 3 days I didn't get a single message from him so after thinking about it because I know it must be hard but I warned him on the first date about my dad. I know its hard, but how long does it take to send a text? 2 seconds! So I dumped him because he wasn't being there for me. I wanted closure so a few days after I texted him, he got confused on the texting part if it was after the breakup or when he was in the hospital. So I told him 3 days i was in the hospital, he just send a text how he wants to meet in person to try and work this out. I'm conflicted and I really do not need anymore stress than I do now.

**tl;dr**: Should I hear my then boyfriends ''reasons''?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My dad has a rare form of pancreatic cancer for four years (since Sept 2010). Recently a tumour in the liver exploded about a month ago and that's when things got downhill. I found out yesterday the radation is to slow things down and to keep the few healthy liver cells alive. We do not know if it's going to work. He hasn't had a appiette in a week and today he had one as well as very alert. He told me that he is going to die but he wants to die with dignity. It just sucks knowing that your father won't be here. I just want the waiting game to be over. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Struggles of being hearing impaired </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-01 04:17:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been hearing impaired for all my life and I wear two hearing aids. Yes, I'm very lucky to be able to get the care I need, but there are several struggles that I face everyday that many do not. Having a sense of humour helps me through this. I joke when my friends didn't hear me (shocking right) I say that my hearing loss is spreading onto them lol. I also joke that I'm the extra in pitch perfect in the deaf jew scene. I no longer have to worry about what to dress up as for halloween. I just need to be myself!

1- I had a professor refuse to repeat what he said in the lecture (no power points) even though the week before I told him I was hearing impaired. He said if I didnt keep on raising my hand I would of heard it. 

2- People tell me that I talk to loud and a recent incident happened when I was sitting outside with friends at Starbucks and someone told me to lower my voice. I can't hear how loud I am and people do not understand that it's not my fault.

3- People think I'm deaf and it's sad that people do not know the difference between hearing impaired and deaf.

4- In loud places, I have a hard time hearing conversations 

5- People ask the same questions- can you sleep with them, can you shower/swim with them, if you take them off can you hear, can you read lips/can you read mine, can you get electrocuted? (yes someone asked that) 

6- A few years ago, I worked at a day camp. A kid wanted my attention and I talked to her then I went back to listening to the others when I heard people laughing. My co-workers were laughing at me because the kid wanted my attention again and I didn't hear. I hated working there.

I made this post because I believe people need to be more aware of hearing impairement and deaf. So the next time you hear someone talk loud think before you speak. They may wear hearing aids.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have depression, and I went through a very difficult time from Nov-March. My dad cancer spread and after hearing so many good things it crushed me knowing that the treatment didn't work. When my sister told me she was engaged a week after I didn't feel anything. That's when I started to notice things were not so good. Suicidal thoughts began and I would always think about my funeral. Once I finally opened up to my therapist and my friends/family about it. I feel a lot better knowing that I'm not fighting it by myself. Yes it was hard to open up, but now I don't feel ashamed and I do not feel alone. I love movies, I watch movies all the time and it allows me to look forward to things ahead. I still have depression but I feel a lot better than I did before. I accepted what I had and I'm not letting it stop me. I always have a laugh about life because it makes things better when things are funny!  </TEXT>

Being with someone who has been charged for domestic violence charge is very dangerous. If I were you, I would protect yourself because you are very vulerable in this situation. He is very dangerous and he wants you to feel guilty by saying he is going to commit suicide. Maybe he has a mental illness that you are not aware of that triggered the violence etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know what to say, I'm struggling the same thing to be honest. How am I supposed to help where I can't help myself. I learned that life does suck but its how you deal with the situation it can make life better. Losing a puppy is like loosing your best friend. I can't tell you what that experience is like because I haven't experienced it yet. Being heart broken sucks, but it will get you closer to finding someone who will feel the same way about you. Sometimes we all think we don't have people who care about themselves, but we are wrong. There is people out there who care about you could be your parents, friends, teacher, neighbours, here on reddit. There is someone there for you. I know the feeling of the thought of dying would just make everything eaiser, and trust me I would but knowing that I'm so young and my family would be heart broken kills me inside. Show the girl that she is missing out by doing things you never thought you would do. We all have our moments when we will weak, but it is up to us to steer back into the right directon. Don't give up kid! You can do it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm on cipralex for about probably two months now. The beginning you'll notice that you may not be as alert as you used to be that was a side effect for me. I felt very tired at the beginning but then your body will adjust. The medication will not work right away it will take 3 weeks. I was very scared during the 3 week time because my sucidial thoughts increased to the point where I was picturing wires wrapped around my neck. But my doctor increase my dosage and I'm fine so far. Stress can increase your behaviours so try to find coping mechanisms to help you out.  </TEXT>

The internet can be a cruel place for anyone. Unfornately, there isn't much you can do to decrease the negative comments but there is a great quote from 50/50 the movie "You can't change your situation, the only thing you can change is how you deal with it''. There always going to be people that have to bring people down, but you just have to tune them out. As long as you are happy that all it matters.

Ask him maybe how's he feeling or how are you. I mean this is a tricky question because everyone is different.

<TEXT> So it's going to be three weeks this week I believe that I've been taking cipralex to help with my anxiety and depression. My doctor told me it takes about three weeks for the meds to work. Today my suicidal tendencys/thoughts have increased to the point where I was tempted to put my hands on my neck which I did but I stopped myself then I saw a cord and I visualized the wire wrapped around my neck. I know it sounds really crazy, but is it normal for meds to increase the thoughts because I was told after 3 weeks I would notice a change    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Every single day for the past few months the thought of death has popped in my mind and I visualize as well too. Recently I decided to get these feelings off my chest and let someone know what has been going on in my head. Telling someone a friend that you feel comfortable, going through the sane thing or talk to a professional. I've been talking to one since August but it wasn't until almost a month ago i confessed to how i was feeling. It sucks waking up every day with nothing to look forward to, but telling someone how you feel and maybe meeting others that experience what your going through will help. I'm 21, you are so young do not give up! Keep your head up! Find something that distracts you. I watch movies and tv shows all the time. its the only thing that keeps me have a real smile on my face you are not alone  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I watched the episode, I was wrong about Jeannie being somewhat involved with Lukes death. Look like Dre and his wife worked on it together (wasn't really clear). Overall, it was kind of a filler episode nothing really happened until the end with Marty and Jeannie. But, I saw a preview it looks like the aftermath of Jeannie telling her friend is going to happen next ep season finale. My guess someone gets put to jail.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-02-27 19:09:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So ever since November, I have not been the same. My dad cancer has spread even more and it made me in a darker place that I thought I would never be in. I get up every morning with nothing to really look forward too. The only thing that gets me excited is movies and TV shows which is really sad but honestly the truth. I used to love Skiing and I just went for a few days, but its not the same as it used to be. I told my social worker what I have been feeling down and thinking suicidal thoughs which come and go away, but now she is scared for me. Which makes it worse. She wants me to go book an appt with the doctor and she wants me to tell my parents. My parents know nothing, they think I'm a happy go lucky girl who likes to make others laugh, but when I get home and go into my room its a whole other thing. A part of me just thinks its my head talking and I may not actually be depressed but i have no idea. I just don't want to be judged you know.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So again another friend took me go to see Endless Love. I saw the trailer and I didn't really want to see it as well it didn't do so well on Rotten Tomatoes. The only movie I really want to go see is Veronica Mars, but any how it is not a bad movie. Obviously, it is no where as good as the Notebook or Walk To Remember. It was a cute, romantic movie and the scene where the main female character gets in a car accident scared the living crap out of me. Has anyone seen the 1981 one with Brooke Shields?  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So my friends made me see Pompeii in 3D. The film in my opinion was a huge miss and I will forget I even watched this movie because nothing stood out in the movie. It is so obvious what was going to happen. Kiefer Sutherland and Kit Harington star in this flop movie. The effects and the music were good, but the acting and the storyline was lacking. And I just realized that the poster for Pompeii that is on IMDb is actually from the last scene of the movie. So you don't even need to watch the movie you can just look at the poster and you know what will happen. Kiefer Sutherland accent was terrible and he should stick to what he knows which is playing Jack Bauer and shooting people with a gun. What did you think of the movie? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I always look at Rotten Tomatoes, because it shows combined with users and critics if the movie is good or not. It does affect the way you watch the film because if you go on a site that says the movie rating is low you will have low expectations of the movie and may not be motivated to watch it, but its the same with good ratings such as American Hustle. American Hustle got great ratings and I was so excited about it, but when I watched it I was bummed because I had such a high expectations of the film because of the cast, director and the great reviews. When I watched it, it did not reach up to its expectations. It's good to know if the movie is worth watching with the ratings, but don't take it too strongly all the time because sometimes a movie that is rotten is actually one of my favourite movies. So it all depends on the individual.  </TEXT>

Not many people know about the film, but it's one of Jennifer Lawrence first films she ever done, Chole Grace Moretz and Selma Blair are in the film as well.

The scene that broke me was when Agnes (Jennifer) confronted her mom and the pimp. It was so sad because she has a gun in her hand and she's trying to get her mom to listen but she won't. Also if you watch the movie, you feel sympathy for Agnes character because she has to take over the parent role even though she's still in high school because her mom has drugs and alcohol problems. Another sad thing about the whole movie in general, is that this story is based on the director childhood life which is really upsetting because a few scenes were heartbreaking to watch. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Frozen, I know it's Disney but I'm telling you it's amazing plus Let it Go will be stuck in your head for the rest of your life. Not your typical disney movie. 

Way Way Back- Great cast- Steve from The Office, Toni Colliete, Liam James etc. Has a mix of comedy, drama and romance. Movie from a 14 year old perspective. 

Catching Fire- Dark intense compared to the first movie. Lots of character development and more entertaining.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Life sucks., but it is up to us to determine what we want to do. I know what it's like to wake up every morning and having nothing to look forward to. I know the feeling of how if I end my life it will all go away. But then I look around, I see my friends, my family and my dad. My dad has cancer for almost four years. Every single day, he wakes up with a smile on his face. No matter how much pain he is in he always hides it and jokes about his cancer. Why am I telling my life to you? Because I know what you are feeling and it sucks trust me. But, there is so much ahead you don't even know it. The thing is if we kill ourselves voluntary, that means we lose. And it's not about win or lose, but it's about giving up. Life has it ups and downs and there will be plenty of downs, but if you give up you will miss on so many moments. It's not worth it, trust me.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I have been thinking about death a lot and have been since November when my dads cancer has spread. I don't know I guess when I heard the news it just crushed me. Now, people who know me think I'm this happy go lucky girl who likes to make others laugh and always smiling. The problem is that's not really me. I only do that because it helps me forget my problems. I have no one to talk to because it's rare to find another 20 year old who's parent has cancer as well. I'm not close with my sisters. My sister got engaged like a week after the cancer news and I still try to be happy for her, but I'm not. Does that make me a bad person, that I would rather watch a movie or a tv show then to dress up and go to a wedding? I mean everything seems gray now, I'm very talkative at school but when I get home I stay in my room and go on the internet  for hours. I only talk to people usually if they message me first. I have no one to talk to, I have friends but I'm a secretive person. I also am 99.9% have anxiety. I'm always worried, when it comes to driving- I did not drive at all last winter and driving a new car. When it comes to school and just every day things. So I'm getting this off my chest- if someone was to give me something that would allow me to die, honestly I would take it. I'm just not happy.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> My grades are good, I get A's and B's but that is all going to change because of my teacher. I'm hard of hearing and been struggling in his class. He is old school and writes barely anything on the board. All he does is just talks which is very hard for me to listen and then have to take notes at the same time. So I raised my hand in the second class asking him to repeat something and he said he already repeated it and if I stop raising my hand I would of listen. He is so rude and he thinks the class is so dumb saying oh its so easy. Also yesterday he was ''trying'' to help a student out with a formula and he said something that he says to his dog and he told the class that. I had my complains of teachers, but not to the point where he will not help, he is so rude and he won't even put anything on the board even if you ask. I don't understand how he got hired.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Books are most of the time better the film because of many reasons. There are many times that the actors are miscast and do not represent the characteristics that were mentioned in the book. Also, the movie can only be so long and do not add a few plots from the book due to time which sometimes is disappointing because we look forward to a part of the book and it is not included into the film. The only movies that I watched that were almost good as the book was Catching Fire and the Help. It is really hard for the director and the film crew to make a movie better or just as good as the book.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **My 5 Questions:**

1. One word to describe the feeling you felt when you got to portray Veronica Mars once again? 
2. Veronica Mars is known for causing trouble, what was the worst thing you have ever done when you were in high school? 
3. Out of all the mystery twists such as (Aaron Echollos being the murder of Lilly Kane, Cassidy being the school bus killer, Logan's friend being the rapist in Season 3, the TA killing the dean etc) which one shocked you the most?
4. Veronica Mars had so many guest stars that were not well known when the show was airing, but are well known now such as Jessica Chastain, Paul Rudd, Melissa Leo, Jane Lynch, Michael Cera, Aaron Paul just to name a few. Is there a guest star that was featured on the show that you would love to work with again?
5. If you could take one thing from the Veronica Movie set what would it be and why?

<TEXT> V for Vendetta is one of my favourite movies. It's dark and is full of mysteries. I think it's a great movie much different than the other movies listed. Superhero movies are mostly for entertainment, but if you have the right writers and the right cast and director like Nolan for the Dark Knight Trilogly then you're set. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have not been diagnosed with anything, but if this feeling continues I am going to go to the doctor. I've been really down on myself and the only thing that kind of cheers my mood is watching movies/tv shows. Anyways, I'm 20 years old, I got a friends mutual friends etc but I only tell like a few what is actually going on in my life. My dad cancer gotten worse. 3 years ago, it was very hard on me emotionally and I gained a lot of weight. My dad had a treatment where he was able to not loose weight or any hair which was really good because he continued on his life like nothing ever happened and he looked healthy. But about a month, the cancer spread liver, hip and spine and the doctors think the treatment will shrink the cancer but it crushed me in a million pieces. My sister got engaged and I'm just not looking forward to it because a little part of me is scared my dad won't make it.  I'm not as happy as I was before, I was the friend that cheered other people up but not anymore. Also one of my good friends was diagonsed with depression and has cut himself so I think that also made it harder for me as well. Plus there is this girl who I used to be friends with but I distanced myself because she has no filter and some of the things she says it's actually hurtful and she's kind of a bully but not intentionally. She also gets mad at the littest things, she was very mad that I didn't sleep over and made a whole big deal about it. It's hard to smile when at home and look at your life and it is not perfect </TEXT>

<TEXT> Make sure that she did not sleep with anyone else because there is a slim chance it could not be your baby. You should be supportive and ask what she wants. I think abortion would be the best route to go because its unplanned, you guys are both young, it was a one night stand but its all up to you two.  </TEXT>

Do you like movies, TV shows, writting poems etc? Maybe there is another outlet you can use? My life is pretty hetic so I watch Movies, TV shows as an outlet to distract myself from the real world </TEXT>

<TEXT> Coming out is not easy. I don't know what it's like, but being able to come out of the closet and not know how people are going to react is very brave. You should be proud that you were able to do that, because unfortunately many are scared and hide their sexuality. Have you ever thought joining a LGBT group where you can meet new people and those that are experiencing what you are? You should not end your life, because if you do then your dad will win. You want to show your dad that you are better by living life to the fullest. You have so much to experience in so little time. Maybe go stay at a friends house? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Getting something off my chest </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-12-27 18:00:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, I have a lot that I need to get off my chest so here it goes. I'm 20 years old and I'm a friendly person, but I only have a few friends. But, I only tell like two friends what I'm going through because I'm a secretive  person. I'm very social when I'm at school but when I get home I hardly text anyone except my close friends.  My dad was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2010 when I was 17 years old. It was so hard for me and but my dad put a smile throughout everything which kind of helped. He had this treatment where he did not have to loose any weight or hair and he looked normal sometimes I forgot he had cancer because he continued his normal routine. But, recently after some time off of another treatment we found out that the cancer spread. It went onto the hip, spine and expanded in the liver. It crushed me so hard, I have nothing to look forward too but I try to stay strong for me and my dad. He went to the barber today to shave the rest of his hair off since the chemo is making his hair go. Recently right after, my sister got engaged and I'll be honest with you with these news you are supposed to be jumping up for joy and I wasn't. I had to fake it which I feel really bad. The thing is people probably wonder why I only talk about movies and TV shows is because my life at home is hard to talk about. Many people do not know what its like to have a parent with cancer. It affects you emotionally and personally. So I got it off my chest, it feels really good.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sorry to hear that, but at least you guys only dated for a short amount of time. But, you're young only 17 years old you have plenty i mean plenty of time to find someone else. Being 17 years old in a relationship isn't easy and you may be suprised a lot of people loose their friends because they get into the relationship a little more than they should. I say return it buy it for something nice, or donate it to someone in need.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Beware, I have no experience in screenwriting so the format will be off and I haven't shown this to anyone so I just want to see if this is a good story and if I'm doing decent so far.

Charlie (V.O.): 
It all started back in public school, when life was supposed to be full of rainbows. But unfortunately, that wasnt the case for me. I hated public school. I hated the teachers, the chairs and most of all my classmates. I was bullied everyday because I was different.  Somebody named Johnny Depp once said it's OK to be different, that it's good to be different, that we should question ourselves before we pass judgment on someone who looks different, behaves different, talks different, is a different color. But I disagree, being different is what got me bullied in the first place and it made my years at public school like hell. Now I never been to hell so I have no idea what it is like, but from what I hear about it in movies its a place that I never want to go to when I die.  Anyways, now you are probably wondering, what about me is different and makes me stand out than others? Im hard of hearing and have been since the day I came out of my moms vagina. My mom couldnt afford speech therapy or hearing aids because she worked seven days a week and could barely pay off her bills. So I had trouble hearing what people were saying and my voice sounded very low and raspy. Because of that, I became the bullies number one target to torture and no one ever wants to be on their monitor. So one day during public school in grade 8, Jesse the most popular kid in school decided he would be funny and signed my name on the Talent show list for me to sing.  Little did I know, I was apart of his little joke and I was laughed at by the entire school. Ever since then I stopped talking to everyone except my mother and people used to refer me as The Boy Who Was Mute. 

INT.  DINNER TABLE- PRESENT DAY 4 years later 

Charlie is eating dinner on plastic plates on a small dinner table across from his mother who wears clothes two sizes too small. There is an awkward silence in the room and the audience can only hear chewing. 

Shelly takes a bite of her food and puts the fork down looks at Charlie.

Shelly: I know you dont like to talk about this, but hun it has been four years. Dont you think you should spend your last year in a real high school and make some friends? 

Charlie: Mom! I really like being home tutored and I like hanging out with you.

Shelly: Thats sweet, but dont you want to hang out with kids your own age?

Charlie: It doesn't bother me and I dont want to. I rather hang out with you. 

Shelly: Thats lovely that you want to hang out with your old mother, but you are going to miss out on the high school experience. 

Charlie: I think Ill pass. 

Charlie tries to change the conversation 

Charlie: Can you pass the water please?

Shelly gives a sigh and passes the water to Charlie.

Shelly: I think you are making huge mistake, you are going to miss Prom and so many other things!

Charlie: Its a mistake, Im willingly to make. Plus you only want me to go to prom so you have an excuse to borrow money from dad.

Shelly: That is not true, and you are going back to school! 

Charlie: Mom! Come on, you know I hate school. 

Shelly: I know you do, but it has been almost four years since the incident. I think everyone has moved on by now. 

After a few seconds, Charlie realizes he will not win this fight so he gives up 

Charlie: Fine, I'll go.

Shelly smiles widely and gets up from her chair to go hug her son from behind. 

Shelly: Trust me, there are worse things in life than going back to school. 

Shelly walks back to her seat and talks about the things they need to get for Charlie for school. 

FOCUSES ON CHARLIE VOICE OVER

VO: Charlie looks at Shelly, 
I knew it was a bad idea and I would have had done anything for me not to go back to school, but seeing the smile on my moms face and seeing how happy she is, is something I havent seen in a really long time so I didnt want to disappoint her. I mean how bad could going back to school can be? I mean having cancer is pretty bad and way worse than going back to school so it shouldnt be bad, or at least I hope so. 






INT:  IN THE CAR 
TEXT 2 MONTHS LATER- September 2015

Old car drives in front of the high school

Charlie looks at the high school silently and sees people walking into the building through his window.

Shelly: That door is not going to open its self. 

Charlie: I know, I guess I wish I didnt have to go back.

Shelly: I know its going to be hard, the first few days wont be easy but do it for me okay.

Charlie looks at his mother

Charlie: Im only doing this for you.

Shelly  fakes a smile 

The bell rings

Shelly: That is time for you to go.

She leans into her son for a hug and Charlie walks a little bit from the car with his backpack turns to face his mother before he walks to the building. 

Shelly puts the window down and yells

Shelly:  I made your favourite for lunch today!!

Charlie: Thank you! See you later.

Shelly: Ill pick you up when school is done. Dont forget to use your voice okay!

Charlie: Thanks mom! 

Charlie waves to his mom and she drives away. Charlie turns around to the school 

Charlie: Welcome to hell Charlie (mutters to himself) 

Kid 1 walks by to see Charlie not moving and staring at the school

Kid 1: You know that you have to move your legs to get to class.

Charlie looks at Kid 1 and tries to speak but nothing comes out 

Kid 1: Weirdo (walks away) 

Charlie breathes in and out 

Charlie: Great! Im already on a great start, WOOT! (sarcastically and mutters to himself and walks to school building)

INT: Class Hallways
Charlie walks to his first class and peaks through the window- he sees that the teacher is already started so he opens the door.

Mr. Evans stops talking and looks at Charlie

Mr. Evans: Youre late

Charlie mouths sorry and walks to his seat

Mr. Evans: Whats your name boy?

Charlie didnt hear and his classmates start to laugh and takes a seat

Mr. Evans talks in a louder tone 

Mr. Evans:  Whats your name boy?

Charlie realizes that Mr. Evans asked him a question and mouths sorry and gets paper and writes his name. Mr. Evans has a confused look on his face. 

Some of his classmates remembered him, including Jesse 

Mr. Evans: Charlie, nice name, but next time come to my class on time. Okay?

Charlie nods to the teacher

Jesse: Charlie buddy! I didnt recognize you at first! Where have you been? 

Charlie ignores Jesse and focuses on the teacher

Jesse: Probably working towards in becoming the next Helen Keller, how is that working out for you (says in a joking way)  

Charlie starts to sink into his chair 

Mr. Evans: Enough Jesse!! Now we are going to discuss about Scarlett Letter. Has anyone heard of it?

Abby raises her hand

Mr. Evans: Yes Abby? 

Abby: I watched Easy A does that count?

The class laughs

Mr. Evans: What does Easy A have to do with the Scarlett Letter? (confused)

Abby: Emma Stone character had to read the book in the movie.

Mr. Evans: Well if Emma Stone had to read it, then all of you have to read the first twenty pages.

The whole class groans 

Mr. Evans: Welcome back to school ladies and gentleman.  

Bell rings 

Mr. Evans: Dont forget to do your reading! See you next week.

Everyone in class left, except for Charlie who is about to leave

Mr. Evans: Next time come to my class on time okay? 

Charlie nods 

Mr. Evans: I know its hard to be here, but youre doing a good job so far. Keep your head high son, this is just the beginning. 

Charlie: Thanks (quietly) and walks out the door 
 
Charlie VO: Scene is Charlie sitting in another class 
As much as my mother is always right, this was one of the only times she was ever wrong. No one had forgotten what happened four years ago and when I walked into the doors. Man, I wished I had a time machine badly to go back into time right now like in the Back To The Future movie, but I know what is going to end up happening.  Im going to be in the same building as the male version of Regina George for eight months, which is eight months too long for me. Even a minute with Jesse makes me want to bury myself in a grave. Lets just say these eight months will go by very slowly and I dont know how long Ill last before I explode. 

INT: Lunch Room

Charlie walks into the lunch room and from his POV the audience sees the cafeteria 

Charlie VO:
Ill be dead honest with you, the first few days of school or anything pretty much sucks. One because you dont know anyone and two you're an outsider which means you're the kid who eats lunch in the washroom stall and trust me no one ever wants to be that kid who cries while eating a sandwich in the stall while the popular kids laugh at you.  Its not fun and I already did that for all eight years in public school and I do not want to go back there ever again. 

Kid 1: What is it with you and staring at people? You are starting to give me the creeps. 

Charlie VO: That is my cue to stop talking to myself. But hey its not my fault, Im Jewish and one thing about Jews is that we like to talk. 

Kid 1: Only if I knew what you are thinking in that huge head of yours Weirdo. 

Kid 1 walks away and Charlie sits at a table by himself.

Jesse walks into the cafeteria with his group and spots Charlie.  

Jesse: Listen up everyone!! (all of the lunch room is quiet) 

Jesse: I got a joke that I think its really funny and I wanted to share with you all. What do Charlie and Helen Keller have in common? They both cant talk (laughs with his friends)

Charlie VO: Jesse is very hard to read. I dont know his purpose for making my life a living hell. Is it because I get better grades than him or is it because hes just plain bored and making fun of me is entertaining for him. Whatever it is, I hope he stops soon because these Helen Keller jokes are getting old fast. 

Ms. Bomer  goes up to Jesse 

Ms. Bomer: Thats enough Jesse, see you at 3pm. 

Jesse: Are you asking me out Ms. Bomer? Im flattered, but teachers shouldnt ask their students out.  

Ms. Bomer: Enough silliness, you have a date in dentition.  If you do not show up, I will have to call your parents. 

All of his friends: Somebody is in trouble! 

Jesse: Im scared, Ive been a very naughty boy. Are you going to spank me? 

Ms. Bomer: Principals office NOW!

Jesse: Your last name is very misleading, its a shame you decided to be a teacher. Anyways see you later boys! Gotta speak to the Principal. (Waves goodbye and walks away) 

Ms. Bomer has red cheeks and is very mad and walks up to Mr. Evans 

Ms. Bome : How is this boy not expelled?

Mr. Evans: His parents are very involved and donate a lot of money to the school. 

Henry: Perks in being a rich kid (walks by and takes a seat beside Charlie)

Henry: Im Henry and you must be mute boy!

Charlie VO: I would pick weirdo over mute boy any day. 

Henry: Anyways, Im not here to make fun of you. I think Jesse does enough of that and too much in my opinion. Im here because I was assigned by Mr. Evans to be your peer buddy!

Charlie VO: Great, a teacher feels bad so he forces a student to hang out with me. Is this supposed to make me feel good at all about myself because its not working. 

Henry: Now, dont take it too harshly. Im just here to show you the ropes. Just a heads up, dont bother fighting against the cool kids because youll never win.  Anyways, Ill see you around buddy (slaps Charlie on the back and walks away) 

Charlie VO: The only thing that is getting me through this day is my moms homemade egg sandwich. When will this day ever end?  (puts his head down on the table) 

INT
The Bell rings for the end of the day 

Everyone walks out into the busy hallway then Charlie is by himself looks at his watch then walks out in the hallway and out the door. Charlie then turns on his phone and gets a text from his mother that she is running behind. Charlie shrugs and walks home. 

Charlie opens the door and surprised to see his mom kissing his father
Charlie fake coughs to get their attention and his mother/father stop to look at Charlie

Charlie: So this was why you were running behind because you were attacking dads face with your lips. Well I wont keep you, Ill be in my room doing my homework. (Charlie leaves)

Harvey: He didnt even say hello to me!

Shelly: Do you blame the kid? You hardly come see him. You should go.

Harvey: Youre fucking kidding me? I have to leave? That kid is my son remember?

Shelly: Charlie is having to deal with changes with going back to school and all, I dont think us fooling around will make it any better for him. I want him to do well in his studies. You can come back later, just give it a few days. 

Harvey: You should of thought of it before I came here.

Shelly: I should of, but I wasnt thinking as a mother like I should of. 

Harvey: Whatever bitch (leaves the door slammed) 

Shelly goes to the couch 

Charlie goes to see his mother who has tears and stands near her. 

Charlie: Why do you do this all the time? Go back to him! You separated from him for a reason. He was terrible to you, he cheated on you and yet I still see your lips on his. Why is that?

Shelly: He was my first love Charlie. We met in high school in grade 10 and married three years after that.  I dont know how to be with anyone else except him because hes the only person I been with.

Charlie: Just because he was your first, it doesnt mean he has to be your last. 

Shelly: For a young kid, you have an old soul. 

Charlie: You calling me old? (playfully slaps his mom on the shoulder) 

Shelly: You are very mature for your age. 

Charlie: What can you say, Im one of a kind.  (smiles at his mom and puts his head on her shoulder for a few moments)

Shelly: How was your first day of school?
Charlie: Not bad, could be worse 

Charlie kisses his mom on the head and gets up

Charlie: Im going to go to do some homework and Ill steal something from the fridge for dinner later. (leaves the scene)

Charlie is in his room doing his homework while he can hear his mother yelling on the phone and puts earphones in it to block the noise. 


INT: Classroom

Charlie VO: Dont get me wrong, I love to learn just not with other people. Why? People sometimes say the stupidest shit out loud such as 

Kid 2: So was Oprah the one who gave the I have a dream speech

Kid 3: Where is Canada? 

Kid 4:  Helen Keller she was blind and deaf, but how could she write books and  communicate with others? 

Ms. Evans: I think thats it with questions you have regarding history, but

PA SYSTEM: CHARLIE MATTHEWS PLEASE COME SEE THE GUDIANCE COUNSLLER 

Charlie VO: What did I do now?
INT: GUDIANCE OFFICE

Charlie knocks on the door

Ms. Swift: Come on in

Charlie walks in the room silently 

Ms. Swift: Take a seat Charlie

Ms. Swift notices that Charlie thinks hes in trouble

Ms. Swift: Dont worry you are not in trouble. 

Charlie sighs as relief and takes a seat

Ms. Swift: We havent met before, but I spoke with your mom once before.  But, I was informed that you need to complete your forty hours of community service by the end of the year if you want to graduate with the rest of your classmates in June. Now this hospital is looking for volunteer and the orientation is tomorrow (shows it on the computer). 


INT:   Hospital

Charlie looks down at the piece paper and looks up to the hospital and walks in 

Charlie looks around and walks up to the information desk 

Information Desk Lady: Hi, what are you looking for? 

Charlie tries to speak, but nothing comes out 

Rude Guy looks very impatience who is behind Charlie 

Information Desk Lady: I wont be able to help you out, if you arent able to tell me the question you have.

Charlie tries to speak 

Charlie: Orientation (speaks it very quietly and slowly)

Information Desk Lady: Sorry dear, but you need to speak a little bit louder than that. 

Rude Guy is really annoyed 

Rude Guy: Come on (mutters to himself, but loud enough for Charlie to hear)

Charlie mouthes Sorry and walks away

Information Desk Lady: Let me know if you need help

Charlie VO: For someone who gets paid to help others, she sure isnt helpful. 

Charlie gives up and takes a seat 

Emma comes up to Charlie 

Emma: You look a little lost

Charlie tries to speak, but nothing comes out 
Emma looks at the piece of paper that Charlie is holding

Emma: Can I see that for a second?

Charlie gives piece of paper to Emma

Emma reads the paper 

Emma: You are here for the orientation, come with me Ill show you where you have to go. 

Charlie: Thanks  (mouths to Emma silently) 

Emma: Anytime

Charlie gets up 

Emma: My name is Emma, my dad is a doctor here. I volunteer here often.

Emma gives her hand to shake with Charlie

Charlie: Charlie (soft tone)

Emma: Charlie?

Charlie nods 

Emma shakes hands with Charlie

Emma: Nice to meet you Charlie, follow me.

Emma walks with Charlie in the hospital to go to the orientation room. 

INT: Home

Charlie VO: Although it was only for a few minutes, its been a while since a girl that is not my mother talked to me and it was really nice to finally talk to someone that is my age.  As much as I love my mother, I cant stand her talking about Bold and the Beautiful. Enough is enough! Liam and Hope will never be together! 

Charlie walks into his house with a smile on his face

Shelly: Why are you in a smiling mood? 

Charlie: Im not (goes to drink some juice from the fridge)

Shelly: I want to come to orientation next time, it looks like fun by seeing the smile on your face.

Charlie: Its not orientation 

Shelly: Is there a guy that you liked?

Charlie: A guy? Mom Im not gay.

Shelly: Shucks, I always wanted a gay son.

Charlie: Why?

Shelly: I wanted someone I can go shopping with and hang out with. 

Charlie: You claim that we dont have a lot of money.

Shelly: We dont, but it would have been nice if you were gay.

Charlie: Sorry mom, I had a huge crush on my second grade teacher. I think its pretty clear that Im straight.

Shelly: Not even bisexual?

Charlie: Nope!

Shelly: Rumor has it, if you drink alcohol you can become bisexual. 

Charlie: MOM! 

Shelly: Okay! I tried, but I think I won the lottery. I have a pretty cool son.

Charlie and Shelly share a smile

Shelly: So tell me about this girl, she must be something if she made you smile that big.

Charlie: How did you know its about a girl?

Shelly: You just said youre not into boys, so whats the other option, animals?

Charlie: She is a volunteer and  her dad works at the hospital as well.  I guess its been a while since a girl came up to me and talked to me that isnt older than me.

Shelly: Hey! Im not that old.

Charlie: Your not, if you were you would be using a walker and living in a retirement home.

Shelly: You know how to make me feel younger (laughs) 

Charlie: I hope to see her again, she was really nice.

Shelly: I have a feeling that you will see her again.

Charlie VO: I hope my mom is right.

<TEXT> This is something I wanted to get off my chest for a while now. I never realized the word cancer makes other uncomfortable until you have someone close to you that been diagnosed to cancer and you try to tell your friends, but majority of them are speechless and doesn't know how to respond. I guess not maybe 20 year olds have a parent with cancer. I just hope one day, people my age will be able to openly talk to their friends about it and not worry about making their friends uncomfortable.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are not useless, cancer is not easy for the people affected by it as well as the person that has it. You should find someone to talk too, because your keeping it all in and that is not good for you trust me from experience. I'm in the exact same boat as you. First off, you need to tell you friends or someone what's going on then you need to find an outlet besides school on a way to distract you. Second, you can't find a cure, but you can offer her  something like if she wants coffee or something and I think you need to tell your mom how you feel and maybe you can spend some time (everyone needs their space), but maybe look over photo albums etc. All you can do is try. Maybe bring some of her favourite things and do them together- movie etc. All I can say is BE STRONG you will need it and she will too. THE FIGHT ISN'T OVER. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know how you feel, but the only thing changed about your dad is that he has cancer. I know it's hard and trust me I'm 20 years old and my dad has been having it for the past 3 years trying to find a cure. Last month, we found out that it spread. The only thing you can do is remain strong, find people that you can talk to, I go speak to a lady because at 20 years old my friends some of them don't know how to respond to the shit im going through. Find an outlet to distract you, such as movies, writing etc. It's going to be hard, but it will make you stronger and you're family as well! </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Everyone is good at something, you just need to have the courage and go ahead and find it. Maybe you like to write, sing, draw? Find something that you like and you can use that as an outlet. I have been feeling really shitty lately and I love to write movie scripts. If you are barely noticed in the group, you need to tell your friends how you truly feel because if they are you're friends, they should care about you. You need to be honest with them, and if they don't care than I say they aren't your real friends. Quality trumps quanity. You have a girlfriend who cares about you, so I think there must be a few good things about you. I think you should join a club or join something where you can meet new people. It's always nice to interact with new people and possible make new friends. If you're friends make you feel like shit, they are terrible friends. You need to tell them how you feel. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can understand why you are nervous because she hasn't been acting her usual self. I say it give it a few days and if this continues, just ask how she's doing or do something that will get her to open up to you. You're young only 17, I say go hang with your friends and go see some movies.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree 100%, Jennifer gave a good performance as the trophy wife which is something she has never done before, but compared to her last years performance in Sliver Linings Playbook it wasn't the best which I don't think that was her intention anyways. But that scene in the bedroom where she and Bale were fighting near the end was really good. Amy Adams was really good besides Bale who I thought were the main two who stood out the most </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hands down Amy Adams in American Hustle. The only thing is her performance was good, but some how every year another actress tops her performance. Amy is a really good actress, but she's starting to become the next DiCaprio (lots of noms, but no wins) </TEXT>

<TEXT> 50/50- Because my dad has cancer and I know how cancer can be uncomfortable to talk about  with friends and I would want my boyfriend to be comfortable with the topic so when I talk about it he can be there for me. Plus 50/50 shows that it's good to laugh once in a while

Pitch Perfect- I'm hearing impaired and Jewish and there is a Deaf Jew scene and it's my favourite movie 

Sliver Linings Playbook- I just love it </TEXT>

Wolf of Wall Street- Leonardo DiCaprio (poor guy, gets beaten each time nominated for an Oscar and never wins- hope this is the time)

American Hustle- Christian Bale

<TEXT> I really did not like The Butler. I thought the meaning of the story was good, but as a film I did not like it. Oprah's performance was alright, but overrated. I think this was based on a true story, but I didn't really like how Oprah's character died. I thought it was poorly done, maybe that is how the character died in real life, but I think the writers could of added in something to make the death not a lazy way to kill of a character INMO. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think for it to be nominated at the Golden Globes, American Hustle would have to be in the comedy category. There were a few minor scenes such as the ice fishing moments that were funny, but the majority of the movie was a drama. I feel like this movie will get lots of nominations, but has a possibility of not winning any awards because it was slightly overrated and personally I thought Sliver Linings Playbook was WAY better than American Hustle (im slightly biased) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I saw the movie today with my family including my parents. And maybe this was not the right movie choice to go see it with because there wasn't just one or two there was like 60% sex/naked woman which made it a little awkward plus I was beside my dad watching it which didn't make it any better. It was 3 hours long which was a little too long to sit in a movie theatre for, but Leonardo DiCaprio did a great performance as Jordan Belfort who gets a little too caught up with himself when he becomes richie rich. Jonah Hill was in it, he was alright but I think Leonardo stole the show.  </TEXT>
