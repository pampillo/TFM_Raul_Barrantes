You can use bread with egg whites, cinnamon, vanilla, and splenda. Or potatoes and eggs with mayo. Or an egg white, spinach. Onion, pepper omelet! Healthy and low cal. Serve with plain Greek yogurt and splenda </TEXT>

<TEXT> False, you don't brush your teeth, shower, put on clothes or get out of bed. Sometimes you can't even reach for your phone because it just seems like so much work. You take sleeping pills all day because you literally cannot be awake or living that day. You don't know what to do, you shake and will cry for no reason, probably do something stupid or rude if you are awake, so you think its better to seclude yourself. Plus, you look like shit. It's time to be alone.

The next day you realize you slept through class yesterday and didn't turn in a paper. You start hating yourself, feeling guilty and thinking about how now youre not going to pass the class, then won't graduate, then won't get a good job, the live at home forever, have no love life, be a fat loser, die alone without friends. Your parents yell at you asking why you did that yesterday. All these thoughts together make you even more depressed, so you go to bed, or, you decide to drink the night away. Then, its midnight and you're crying and I texting your ex that doesn't love you, telling him all your problems and how youre a fuck up, how much you love him. Eventually you pass out, wake up, even mor depressed than yesterday (rock bottom keeps going lower and lower). You see the texts. Feel embarrassed. You're in disbelief that you spilled your guts, now he'll never want to be with me again, now that he knows I'm mentally ill. You decide you're going to cut everyone out of your life, the remaining acquaintances you do have.

This all fucks you up and you decide to call into work because you can't be near people today and can't bring yourself to clean yourself up. You feel bad you're letting your coworkers down and leaving them shorthanded. You feel guilty. The cycle repeats.

Taking time to yourself to do something you enjoy, like reading or drawing or fingerprinting or walking through the park.

<TEXT> Ooh yeah. Well you need to get her to understand the changes in mood and potential of harm she can do. But, shed not going to listen to you if she's impulsive and unhealthy, that's on her and you can't really change that because she'll resent you and then rebel. So, it's kind of something she needs a therapist for. 

Since you're her big brother, she will take what you say and how you act with more emphasis than a parent. You're close in age and did it to. What she's doing isn't all that out of ordinary for a HS  student, but you may need to worry because she was a higher chance of addiction and risky behavior.  </TEXT>

The only thing I'm mad about it not taking much time in the Louvre. That was on my bucket list but skipped through. 

Basically, its up to you. Is the culture or the landmarks more important to you, how do you feel about skipping many major places like the love lock bridge, arch, Louvre and other museums, a few awesome churches, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just wrote this long response but it got deleted. Basically, yes it does take a while to build up but for me, its different than cymbalta or something. I can tell which days I do or don't take it, and recognize its effects. Other than Xanax, there is a very popular pill (I think a benzo) that is nonaddictive and often prescribed because of this. I can t remember its name off the top of my head but you can search for it and do your own research. Allergy pills can affect your brain like Xanax, so it could be used as a quick fix.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah I love that they care and ask me if i need I talk but the only people that understand are people that have gone through it or are currently struggling. Everyone knows my dirty laundry, but not it's extent.

Giving you advice would be hypocritical fit me because I'm stuck in this cycle as well. I don't care about anything including myself and gave up on getting better. You need someone, done meds, and to push yourself to make memories and do things. 

Also, having a drink is fine, everyone gets through the day in their own way, but it's a depressant. Alcohol makes me want to kill myself and everyone I know that has depression (not many open people) feels worse when drinking. Just food for thought. Msg me if you'd like to talk. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Any antidepressant will have people that say good or bad things about it. It depends on the person and what they respond to, and other factors in their life. I'm on it now and gets me out of bed, no anxiety, but makes me feel nothing. But, in a way I'm back to my old self, as far as personality. It's the best out of the 3 I have tried, but do not feel happy at all. I was prescribed welbutrin in addition for energy and getting my emotions back but I feel it makes things worse and stopped. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mingle with your coworkers. Even if you don't love them, it's still is something to do, they can introduce you to people, force you to get out, and improves morale. Be friendly with your neighbors in your apt and see if they're your age. Go to a bar, even if you don't drink, and talk with the bartenders. It will help with the loneliness. Join a gym and see if they have classes and you may meet someone. If you tell them your new they may assist you and will give you something to do. All these things will ease loneliness and make you feel at home. Maybe volunteer a day or two a week somewhere like a music venue or something you're into. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't really like working out. I prefer strength training to cardio. What I don't like is making everything seem like exercise. I was to do natural things to make myself stronger, toned, and thinner. Like moving boxes, tires, carrying things. I like when I had jobs that made me physical because it felt natural. What should I be looking for? Is it called something? Any ideas would be great. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm writing this from my new phone that seems to be malfunctioning so forgive me if it's hard to read.

He said I would move to somewhere with palm trees soon. (I was moving to Florida the following week). Said I would get into trouble with someone named ****. And that this guy was talking to other people and that would get me in trouble. (Not sure on this one. I had met a drug dealer with the same name, a month later I was supposed to pick up and the day of our plans he got arrested, lost big money. Then later found another guy with same name --all within the same week-- as soon as he told me his name I called it quits because of what the psychic said. Could have put me in jail for a felony). Hmm what else, he said I'd have to make a big move in march and id be deciding between 3 places. It'd be a big decision but the decision I would make would be the best one (I did end up moving mid march because something bad happened. Was deciding between living in Florida, home, or with a relative.) Also, said I'm one to "cover my mouth" and not speak up. But I will and it will get me to a better place. Well, what happened during those rough months was due to me speaking up to my boss, which may have been bad to say but it turned out for the best.

Basically said I'd be okay and that I was kinda fucked up be okay. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A guy that looked homeless (lack of a better word) came up to me while I was with my friend at a coffee shop. We were there gossiping about who knows what, never saw him come in or sit down. Then told me he was a reader. Then proceeded to read me, tell me my future. Everything has come true, including dates and names. He was very modest, left abruptly, didn't even let me say thank you (I was like WTF, what do I even say to this guy? Made sure to keep a straight face and not really respond to what he said to lead him on). He left. Just disappeared. I have no idea if he had a car or just walked in to talk to me. Very strange but cool. I've been a mess this past year so I'm sure I have a lot of energy and emit some interesting waves.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, 100%. My depression was based on not knowing how to communicate, cope, express myself, because of my upbringing. And other things of course (genetics, imbalance). But yes, that's why I started to use. Some others here may say they didn't start because of this, but continued to use because of depression. Slippery slope. Fuck depression.

Edit: opiates have been 10x better for my depression than SSRIs/SNRIs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, it affects every single aspect of my life. It'd take me a day to write it out and there are multiple people that have already written articles/blogs on their own experiences. 

What are the biggest things for me (at the moment) have been school. I can't concentrate, I don't care about getting good grades, I don't go to class b/c I can't get out of bed, I feel sick when I get a bad grade or don't know something, I feel alone in the classroom, or i won't be able to complete a class so then i start thinking about my future and how i won't graduate because i can't complete the coursework, so i won't get a job, won't get a house, be broke, no one will want to marry me, can't provide for family, friends hate me, etc, the list goes and on and on it goes.

Then there's work. I can't get out of bed or bathe, so fuck it, I'll call in. Then I'll realize I should just quit because my brain says I'm useless. Hard to remain interested in a job or give a fuck or no get angry at the littlest things. then you start worrying about money without a job and then the wild thoughts run through your head like stated above.

And then socially - I feel like laying in bed all day, in pjs, unshowered. I don't want to talk to anyone. I see people doing things, having fun, excelling at work, and it makes me feel bad about myself. I think I'm useless or boring or a pain for others, a burden, etc.

This was based on depression, but there's also problems with anxiety and mania that are pretty much the same things. </TEXT>

<TEXT> THERE WILL NEVER BE ONE.

Seriously, I was you 6 months ago. Taking opiates because it was the only thing that worked. Some people get depressed and suicidal because of the pills, I was depressed and took the pills to stop the depression. It got out of control and I had to stop. Now I'm on antidepressants that barely help. They suck. Opiates are much better but I'm constantly debating if it's worth the risk. 

Kratom is legal and similar to opiates for me, in terms of motivation and interest. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depends. I mean, I don't eat meat so if someone asks for a recommendation like that, I usually state what others have told me and the reputation. I used to work at a juice bar, and when it wasn't ferociously busy, 90% of the time I had an in depth conversation, explaining everything, giving them recommendations. That was my favorite part of my job!

At the end of the day, though, we all have different tastes. I could like one restaurants type of sauce, and you may hate it, but we both like spaghetti sauce. So, it's hard. But to answer your question directly, no, it's not annoying to me AT ALL. I love it. I think a lot of bartenders are like this too!

I'm sure some people hate it, however, and these people are probably those that hate their job, menu, or products. </TEXT>

Trim up decently. Make sure you're clean. Then start kissing her. Eventually feel and caress her then fuck her. Also, if you get off quick and then button up, you will be a dick if she got no enjoyment out of it. If you care about her, you'd get her off too.

<TEXT> I've become a little more apathetic. I think this has to do with my ability to get 3.0 GPA (minimum) without trying AT ALL. I'm very good at playing the system, and my college is not hard in general. So, I really don't care about walking out of class or skipping or giving a fuck about what I wear, how people perceive me, how many friends I have on campus, etc. If i feel it's not worth my time, i won't show up. If I think a professor is ridiculous I won't show up or I'll let my voice be heard. I guess this is part of adulthood and synonymous with independence.

Also, I learned it's okay to think outside the box and your opinions actually ARE what professors want to hear. I've been lucky to take a handful of classes with professors that let you (and expect you) to be free with your thought. Some of the things I wrote seem like I'm high out of my mind, but it's really just me digging deeper and making connections that I've been forced to not look into in other classes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Have you talked to your doctor about antidepressants? They often help with anxiety all together, rather than a quick fix like xanax. Same with your focus, really will help on a low dose.

I've been on my share of antidepressants that have changed my levels of anxiety. I've found when I'm on a pill that completely removes anxiety, I am unproductive and boring. Anxiety kind of forces me to multitask and complete things fully and quickly. I manage every little detail which is why I do so well, esp at jobs.

<TEXT> I think you new to do some soul searching. Explore, spend time alone, spend time with strangers, travel, take up new hobbies or volunteer. After this, Make a list of your positive traits and what you find you like or value. 

If you don't have a job, get one even if it's not a "career" and work hard at it to make you feel confident. Plus it takes time away from dwelling on your problems and puts your energy into something else other than anxiety.

Think about your "virgin" situation. Do you want to have sex for yourself or because you think it's what you NEED to do (just like you NEED to get a job out of college)? If it's the former, go right ahead and pursue that but know it's not going to solve any problems.

Other than that, someone once told me to not worry about what you're going to do to create happiness for the rest of your life but rather focus on what makes you happy in your current life. (I probably and wording this wrong) 

Good luck I've been there and overcome some of the problems that you've mentioned but still right there with you on others.

I actually live near next to 6 and think 7 is also a great place to live if you like heat.

You can get a job where I live as a waiter anywhere. 1600E is $2000+ America? That'd get you a pretty good apartment here with at least $500 spending money. But this obv changes by location in the US. I'd say the average where I like is $1000USD, so maybe 800E.

Up north, you don't really feel the racism. Down South, it's a little different. I wouldn't really say it's that racist or segregated, but people do have different views than what us in the North view difference races. What you hear about shootings happen, but no, it's not like that. There's rape and mugging but it's not something we should be known for. Inner cities you'll find more or it.

Don't live in Compton or NYC.

Just tell them how you feel and all your symptoms. What helps is to write a list beforehand so they know everything. That's pretty much it.

Say "yes" more to people inviting you to do new things, take up a hobby, read something you find interesting. Then make a list of things you like to do. Not like "taking people's temperatures" but more of your character traits and what eases you/excites you. Discover who you are by what gives you internal pleasure or drive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A few things as a manager for a quick service place (and of course past worker):

Don't let this get you down. Yes, it's mcdonalds but everyone has their struggles and although you may not feel anyone else will hire you, they will. You have something to bring to the table, whether you know it or isn't visible yet.

You supervisor shouldn't make you feel angry or upset. It's his job to LEAD you. Leadership is about bringing out the best in people and helping them towards their goals and growing.

If you're not happy, I'd say quit. I know this isn't always possible because of financial situations but sometimes you just have to go with your gut.

Also, I kind of skimmed this post, but I hope you realize there will always be hardships in life and in a career and need to be able to cope and reorganize yourself to work through these issues. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't eat meat so I'm probably not the best person to ask. What dish is served with these options? Chicken is probably the healthiest, and if I ate meat, I'd only eat chicken or turkey. Lean meat, great protein, plus all the chickens in the world are only alive due to human breeding for dietary purposes, so if you're worried about what is humane, don't worry -- we already ruined the species and I don't think they can become extinct anymore. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So much always happens in an episode, I feel I have to comment while watching the episode to actually convey everything I want to say... But that's not going to happen.

Love Lip's stuff still, I really don't think they're going to get him caught in some way like the others... Unless this is the last season - interesting way to end the show for good is if they put everyone in jail or suicide. I think it's becoming more clear that his storyline will be to enter the professional world and succeed, even if his luck pisses viewers off

Definitely want to kill Sammi. At the same time, I thought she was going to kill herself after she told Ian he was great and going to be okay. Her, Ian, and Charlie could all be in the running for a suicide ending, hopefully not. I think there's going to be a crazy season finale of a very smart death brought upon by Mickey and Fiona, maybe the rest of the Gallagher squad as well.... BUT at the same time, like Lip said last episode, Carl going to jail was inevitable at some point, and Ian getting caught is as well. It was something they were responsible for, Sammi just bridged the gaps I guess.

Don't get Debbie pregnant. Don't. Urghh. Still, I do like the relationship and don't think having sex was wrong for her. Yes, she'd still young, but at least it's in a caring, healthy relationship, plus they seem to be best friends which is most important (i think) during teen sex.

Fucking Fiona, okay, the kiss was in a specific context but just... be a prude for an episode or something.

Hate commenting on Frank but he's so in love, even if it's a friend kinda love. This makes me upset, but happy at the same time. I think the doctor dies at the end of the season, showing that Frank can experience heartbreak and sadness -- I don't think she'll be cured or they'll call her with a fake positive or anything like that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Really interesting thread, the comments completely show the opinions of the males and the feelings of the females. Emotionally, as a girl that's been through this, i would be upset too because I tend to have the "I need it all" mentality with guys and friends, and I can't always get over a hook up if it's not someone I met that night, and have to face as a friend/acquaintance. I know it's bad and not right to do it to him, but it's just my emotions.  Now on the practical side, I would love to say I can move forward and he should not feel bad about my interpretation and doesn't need to apologize. 

I think it's best to both remain practical and show hints of remorse for not being on the same page, as well as learning that girls are weird and emotional. </TEXT>

Haven't you ever heard of the red paperclip trade? Maybe get certified in a trade, like software, design, etc and begin in that way. Good luck. I really say this because I fee the same way and really don't think working for someone is right for me and can't seem to find a company and position that I will work well with. I want to live my life combining all the things I love and be my own leader, I don't know how far working for a company will take me as far as natural fulfillment. I plan on (hopefully) opening my own food business, then expanding to greater things.

<TEXT> It depends. Sometimes I'm in the room I grew up in for 15ish years or in a wide open area like a barn without any furniture. I never seem to be in multiple locations in the dream though, it doesn't change settings. Usually I'm alone or with one other person, although I have had a couple where I was with strangers.. When I say strangers I literally mean people I cannot recognize, have no idea what there name is and feel like I have never even met them in passing in my life. 

No. They feel like they last FOREVER which is terrible because most of them really scare me and I feel I'm trapped. ill fall asleep and then wake up after and see my clock only said 1/2 hour has passed. Feels more like 12 hours in the dream. </TEXT>

I'd keep them out of your cupboard because they might end up harming you. Drink a lot of water though. I also know that if you always eat a lot of fiber, your body gets used to it and you stop shitting so much.

are you eating less and feel more full in general? if so, it's probably good that you're getting extra fiber. just cut back a little bit.

I love chips like corn chips or tortilla chips with salsa. I also have a very unhealthy obsession with bagels and french fries! Gotta cut those out completely. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Intriguing! Can you do a quick run down of what Ayahuasca is and what it's able to do? I feel I read about this once and someone posted it was the worst thing they're ever done but holds great power. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, I get what youre saying. I wouldn't market it as "art therapy" and i doubt we would get to the point with real therapists and correct procedure, etc. Art classes, yes, that is more correct. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel a lot of people have mixed feelings on indian dishes, which tend to be mostly vegetarian. Not sure about that. I want to stay away from pasta because I feel it's so hard to get right. The sauces are something I take very seriously as an Italian-American. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes and no. Maybe I should say Art AS therapy in this case. I was thinking more out loud and probably should have tweeked my wording before posting. My idea is simply to make art, do artistic things, get people engaged, give them something to do, maybe learn a new skill. I'm an art therapy minor and have friends within the program that teach classes that do not call it art therapy but hold the general idea over the classes they offer -- like shrines, mandala work, etc.

Writing this quickly on almost a dead battery so apologies for grammar and what not! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't had this account for 2 months, yet I've gotten 2 months of Reddit Gold so far. I see no perks about it. If there was a better tradeoff, I probably would do it. It'd just me a symbol for our connection, this time and place, who I am and who you are. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Checked briefly his history and did a search that didn't show up with anything. Wasn't until now that I checked the universal block page and even though i scrolled down alphabetically, I did not scroll down ALL the way and see his name. Also now found more dirt on him. Filed a claim with Paypal and hope to get my money back. </TEXT>
