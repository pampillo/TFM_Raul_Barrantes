<TEXT> My dad was in the living room. I walked right past him and then slipped quietly out the door. Three hours later, at about 4:30am, I walked back into the house and passed my dad again. He looked at me and said, "Hey, you going to bed now?". 
It was then that I learned that my parents really don't give a shit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't understand why so many women feel like they need to make a baby. Everyone wants to experience pregnancy. 
Why the fuck would you want to go through that kind of pain? Stretch marks, weight gain, all kinds of complications during the pregnancy, and then of course, labour. Not to mention, raising a newborn is a pain in the ass. 
Yeah, I'd rather adopt.
For me at least, I really couldn't care less if my child looks like me or not. I feel like a much better person knowing that I'm going to hopefully be giving some child's a better life rather than making another useless human to take up more space. </TEXT>
