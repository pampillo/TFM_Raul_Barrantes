<TEXT> Yes, I do. Whenever I have some I take two 25mg hydroxyzine 10 minutes before I dose. I've found that it increases the nod. Can't say for sure whether it increases thr duration though. Comparatively I think it works better than diphenhydramine (Benadryl) for potentiation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I use subs on a somewhat frequent basis and recently I had a conversation with someone who's been on them for way longer than me and had experience IVing them. He told me the naloxone is almost completely inactive due to buprenorphine having a much higher binding affinity for the mu opioid receptor, essentially 'outcompeting' the naloxone molecules at the receptor sites. Is there any truth to this?

edit: If this were true it would seem to imply that the naloxone would be inactive regardless of ROA </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thought I could be a chipper and avoid the physical thralls of addiction. I still am, for now. But for me the psychological aspect of addiction has proven to be just as devastating as the physical withdrawals one can go through. I was naive to think that using infrequently would not lead to persistent, daily cravings. Intense cravings that eventually lead to rumination and thinking how good that next high will be. Not sure how long my love affair with opiates will last. Probably the rest of my life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Last night I had a dream that I picked up a few hundred bucks worth of 30mg oxys for the amazing price of 20 a piece off this girl I know. I was ecstatic, but as I began to crush up the pills I woke up. Needless to say I was very angry and frustrated.

I find this strange though because I'm a chipper and haven't used in over 50 days, even though I still get cravings every day. I realize mine wasn't particularly interesting, but I thought I'd ask here and see if anyone else had any similar dreams they would want to share. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The analysis of antinociceptive efficacies produced by co-administration of ascorbic acid and morphine or tramadol for different levels of nociception, revealed that co-administration provided better antinociceptive coverage than the individual drugs. There is neither a simple explanation for the mechanism of interaction between the two drugs, nor for the type of interaction at different levels of the antinociceptive effect.  
  
Very interesting. It's unfortunate that the mechanism behind this interaction isn't well understood yet. Something I'm curious about is how Table 2 lists the dosage ratio of morphine to ascorbic acid as about 1:260 and how this would translate to actual dosage in humans. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually it depends. If the drug you're snorting has better oral bioavailability than intranasal then a drip is actually desirable and may slightly increase absorption, i.e. oxycodone. But with other drugs like ketamine for example, a drip is less desirable because of how bad oral bioavailability is. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Coke + Oxycodone - Thoughts? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-22 07:27:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi :)  
  
Currently pretty high on this combo and I love it. I find that the oxy takes the edge off some of the uncomfortable twitchiness from coke.  
  
But I also have a question. I'm aware that cocaine is cardiotoxic, but would adding an opiate such as oxycodone to the mix put more "strain" on the heart, making the combination even worse for your heart?  
  
I'd also like to hear what people think about mixing coke with other opiates. Are there any that you prefer mixing coke with? Thank you all, I lurk a lot and don't post too often but I really like this community. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. I had tried quite a few drugs (but not nearly as many as some people on here) before trying opiates. One day I was finally able to get my hands on some 5/325 vicodins. Took 2, smoked some weed and had a great time.  
  
2. The high has a physical aspect to it that just isn't there with weed. No matter how high you get on weed you won't experience the same extent of analgesia you get from opiates. Or the "not giving a fuck" type feeling because of how absolutely amazing you feel from the euphoria.  
  
3. I only use occasionally so that my tolerance stays low and so I can avoid addiction.  
  
4. I would say they've had a negative effect on my social life. I've had to hide my use from most of my friends. It really depends on the person but the guilt from hiding it from certain people can get to you after a while. As for the positive aspect, getting high on opiates is better than every other drug I've tried.  
  
5. I've never binged on opiates since I try very hard to space out my usage.  
  
6. Know that physical withdrawals are the least of your worries compared to the social stigma, monetary cost, tolerance, psychological addiction and even death if you shoot up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, but I've only taken methylphenidate orally. I would say EPH is more euphoric then MPH but it doesn't last as long. EPH is also caustic and burns when you snort it, which is a good enough reason for me to moderate my use and keep my sinuses from getting too damaged. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah I think it popped up in November on the RC market. In my experience 20mg snorted provides brief euphoria that gives way to 2-3 hours of functional stimulation. Less euphoria than EPH but I noticed less vasoconstriction as well. Similar burn to EPH when you snort it. May be caustic. Also, people have reported being pleased with how it vapes off foil and gives a pleasant rush. Personally I wouldn't vape more than 5-10mg though.  
  
For reference I have a moderate to low stimulant tolerance. Remember that RCs can affect everyone differently, so start small with dosing if you get your hands on some. Check out the 3F-phenmetrazine thread on Bluelight for more info :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jesus OP please don't follow this advice. Please don't give out dosage advice for substances that you aren't familiar with, especially a substance as unpredictable as heroin. Nobody should be doing more than 5-10mg at a time snorted without a tolerance, and that should only be after snorting ~1mg to test potency. Heroin has the potential to be cut with the opioid fentanyl, which is active in microgram doses and can significantly increase the risk of CNS depression. Even when taking dosing precautions such as these, you're still playing with fire and I don't recommend it. Stay safe, you can always take more but you can never take less. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would say low dose ethylphenidate complements alcohol well, as well as 3-fluorophenmetrazine. I feel that their short durations allow you to fall asleep more easily at the end of the night than you would if you were on amphetamines.  
  
I tend to start with a small dose (~20mg) early in the night and redose one or two times throughout depending on how much I drink.  
edit: added dosage in case people are curious </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi /r/opiates, I've been lurking for a while and now I have a question.   
  
I have a few 24mg suboxones that I've been chopping into 16ths and snorting. This gets me pretty relaxed. I find subs pretty recreational during my breaks from H but I use infrequently. I'm looking to try clonazepam at the same time but I'm not sure what dosage I should start with. I'm aware that mixing benzos and opiates can be fatal. Cheers! </TEXT>

Does this imply that co-administration of methylphenidate with methamphetamine will decrease the dopaminergic neurotoxicity associated with the latter? If so would it be "safer" to take methylphenidate and methamphetamine at the same time? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for reiterating this point. The top comments in this thread all make excellent points regarding why the White House is incorrect in their analysis, but at the end of the day it boils down to politics. And given the current situation for Democrats, this means walking a fine partisan line to appease the party's usual voters (and corporations/institutions that support the party), especially as midterms draw closer. It seems to me that it's just one of the unfortunate side effects of the influence of money in U.S. politics. </TEXT>

To break through you'll need to hold the smoke in your lungs for a while, as well as use a dose more in the range of 30-40mg. This is assuming your friend has N,N-DMT, not 5-MeO-DMT. I would also recommend reading the DMT FAQ in the sidebar and reading a few DMT trip reports on Erowid. Good luck! </TEXT>

* (C) [Controlled substance analogue] does not include -

See http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Zeta.html  
Like EEBrony said however, the best you can get is an approximation.  
However, if you want better precision within Java (i.e. better than using 64-bit floating point), try using java.math.BigDecimal instead of double for the variable z. It's a bit slower since you need to use methods within the BigDecimal class to perform operations, but you get the benefit of arbitrary precision arithmetic as well as better precision. </TEXT>

<TEXT> College ent here. So me and my buddy were in my dorm enjoying some bong hits and music last Friday when another guy i know knocks on the door with his friend. After the new guy introduces himself, he sees that I'm already high and asks me if I'm an ent. I get pretty excited and say yes. Apparently we both browse /r/trees every day. He was a very chill guy too.  

Then they told me they both came over intending to get high as fuck. So they both throw $10 and I start packing bowls on bowls. After about 5 hits each they were both about to go to sleep. I think I got to 12 rips, and i got pretty high but i was still awake (tolerance). So i woke them up and jokingly asked if they wanted more, and they both laughed and declined the offer. They both went on their way shortly after. Such a chill night.  
tl;dr i met an ent and we smoked, talked and had a great time. ents are great people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're implying that the President is directly responsible for the treatment (not just the policies regarding treatment) of certain minorities by different agencies in the government. "Treatment" is a very personal problem as well: even if we lay rules down, will it guarantee that everyone will be treated the same in all instances of personal interactions within these agencies? In my opinion the two issues you mentioned are completely unrelated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Today I listened to MD rapper Logic's new-ish mixtape: [Young Sinatra: Welcome to Forever](http://www.datpiff.com/Logic-Young-Sinatra-Welcome-To-Forever-mixtape.483644.html). If you don't have time to download, check out the song [Nasty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVbTkFsCc24) (YouTube link) from his mixtape. Very lyrical with a sick beat.  
  
My opinion:  
Overall the mixtape has some solid lyricism and production. There are two skits which I found pretty hilarious. One involves his dad coming into the room while he's recording, and the following exchange is pretty hilarious. He recently signed to Def Jam and is planning to release an LP soon I believe. Worth checking out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 150 pounds or kilos? Also the less fat you have on your body, the better shape you'll be in to pass. You can buy self-test kits from a CVS if you live near one. If you take it in the morning, make sure you wake up early, piss, and drink lots of water to dilute your piss for the test. There is a certain vitamin you can take to help cleanse but I forgot which one; it's definitely worth a google. Good luck man. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Advice on not falling asleep after smoking some very dank indica? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-07-21 20:58:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello ents,

I come to you today with a problem. The weed I have right now is a very potent unnamed indica strain. I smoke out of a triple-percolated chandelier bong. The problem is, after taking only two hits (around 0.5g) of this stuff, I get a very strong body high and begin to feel drowsy.

Do any of you have any advice on how to stay awake after getting a strong body high? Should I change my method of smoking? I also have a bowl and papers if that helps, but I prefer the bong since it's smoother.

Any advice is welcome. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The title is very misleading. Causation cannot be established between the reclassification of a substance and increased rates of psychosis. This is because the latter implies usage, and usage implies possession. Possession is achieved through illegal means anyway, therefore the legal reclassification of a substance bears no correlation to increased rates of psychosis. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're right. I think media outlets should have stressed the importance of providing troubled teenagers with the right kind of help instead of focusing on the age-old gun violence debate. It is a little known fact that even mentally stable people can benefit from therapy or counseling. I think the problem now is a combination of growing up in the information age as well as having to deal with stresses like school and work. Parents should be educated and made aware of certain signs that indicate their child is having a hard time. This should assist them in finding their teenager the right kind of help.  
  
When it comes to giving actual advice to parents with teenagers though, it seems like a tremendously difficult undertaking; I wouldn't even know where to begin. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "the terrorists"  
  
You use those words as if you're implying these people are acting as a group, which couldn't be further from reality. There are domestic as well as foreign terrorists, whose motivations range from hatred of the U.S. and its citizens to crazy, irrational reasons. I think the threat of terrorism has been overemphasized as well as blown out of proportion by the U.S. media.  
  
"Their job", I would say, is dependent on the individual terrorist's motivation. Therefore, determining "whether they have done their job" wouldn't be proving anything.

But to be fair, managers are not always in charge of deadlines, and management style differs drastically depending on the person as well as the company. So yeah, try to code slowly folks. Doing so will help decrease the total number of bugs in the software and ensure proper functionality for release.  edit: grammar </TEXT>

<TEXT> Long term medication is a scary concept. Ive been on medication for around 7 years (growing up) and I can assure you it changes your personality. In my case, I feel overwhelmingly neutral whenever a conflict comes up. I have trouble feeling anything at all and as a result I'm terrible with women. I have never had a girlfriend even though I'm outgoing and have a decent amount of good friends. I am very critical of things that I don't agree with and I criticize those that don't understand certain situations like I do. Stay away from medication in the long term if you can.

Falling asleep with so much pain is terrible. If you have someone in your life who is willing to listen, talking to them will definitely help.

<TITLE> Found 60 bucks on the ground at a [5] </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So last night I smoked and then went to eat at a cafeteria. I had grabbed some delicious brownies and was walking back to the table my friend was at who was at a [6] but he handles his shit like a fucking boss. Looked down on the ground and I found what I thought to be 40 bucks. I rush over and pick it up, suddenly aware people probably think I'm baked as fuck.  
Anyway when I get back to my table and show my friend I take it out of my pocket and it was actually 60 bucks! At this point I could not handle my shit at all; I had just found the largest amount of cash ever in my life on the ground. I was leaning forward on the table giggling uncontrollably, getting paranoid that someone might have seen me pick it up. But no one did, and me and my buddy left the cafeteria 60 bucks richer. I plan on using it to buy an eighth. Good times.  
TL;DR found 60 bucks on the ground, using it to buy an eighth :D  
edit: also I really enjoyed the brownie. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am very experienced with Java, and willing to help! Is there a public repository that I can pull from or does one need to be granted push/pull permissions?

edit: Never mind, I found the GitHub repo and downloaded the source code. Still looking for the bug list.  
edit 2: Found the bug list. Currently familiarizing myself with the codebase. My username on GitHub is test_subject2673.  
edit 3: Working on [#BUKKIT-2181](https://bukkit.atlassian.net/browse/BUKKIT-2181) found the problem in code, will try to fix tomorrow.  
edit 4: Working with undocumented code takes a lot longer, there are hundreds of undocumented functions named a() or b(). Doing the best I can though.  
edit 5: BUKKIT-2181 seems to be a server-side issue that can only be fixed with a client side mod  
edit 6: Commented on [BUKKIT-2193](https://bukkit.atlassian.net/browse/BUKKIT-2193) with a possible fix.  
edit 7: after reading through some of the emails I got after signing up for the github notifications, the sheer amount of complaining is staggering </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're absolutely right about the attitude part. However, the user shouldn't have to choose between familiar/functional interfaces and security (not sure why you called it abstract, do you mean that users aren't aware of how vulnerabilities work?). I use Nightly Linux x86 and first thing I do in the morning is update it, then get on with browsing. If there are multiple updates in one day and it pops up to notify me, I simply press restart to update, wait a WHOLE 5 SECONDS and carry on with my business. Firefox even saves all your tabs for you while you update, so I suppose the point I'm trying to make is why are people so angry about quick updates? My best guess is that the vast majority of users have no idea about major exploits and the consequences of running unpatched software. Feel free to let me know if I'm going in the wrong direction with this though, because what I feel it really boils down to is patience. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Platform fragmentation makes it hard to support a large range of devices when developing apps. As an Android app developer, I understand the struggle of maintaining compatibility with older platforms when newer versions of an app can have API-specific dependencies, and therefore hold nothing against Google in the way they've made Chrome available on Android.
EDIT: I'm a Firefox user though. Where is my file menu Chrome? I'm still waiting for that option. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sad to see the comments section has devolved into a java rocks vs java sucks war. As an intermediate level programmer using Android, I got something out of it. He makes some valid points regarding for each loops which require the use of iterator() and Iterators, which can necessitate more GC when used for long lists. The use of static methods also helps when you don't need to access any instance variables. Google's Developer section also points these things out and more in their documentation article about increasing performance: [Link](http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/performance.html) </TEXT>
