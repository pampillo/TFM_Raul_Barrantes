<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My brother is getting married in a couple months and he and his fiancee are honeymooning in Ireland.

They have asked for wedding presents to be monetary contributions to their trip.

I'd like to keep to their wishes, but in a way that will make my gift be more memorable and meaningful than an amount of money going into a pool. I'm looking for museum tickets or special excursion passes that I can pre-purchase for them and give to them at the wedding. 

Please share recommendations! Thank you! 

Also I have been informed they intend to stick to the southwestern parts of the country to see greenspace and castles. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I mainly research Civil War POWs, and there were a few anecdotes in this podcast that stuck with me.

1. German POWs in Aliceville had so much food they buried the extra to get rid of it

2. American officials treated the German POWs so well because they feared retaliatory treatment of American POWs (but then continued after they discovered how American POWs were really treated).

It's amazing how 80 years, a World War, and an important treaty changed ideas towards POWs in this country. For those interested in reading a modern historical perspective on POWs in the American Civil War, I recommend [While in the Hands of The Enemy](http://www.amazon.com/While-Hands-Enemy-Conflicting-Dimensions/dp/0807130613). It's very critical of both sides and their treatment of POWs.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think anthropology is a wonderful discipline, but I got into the field knowing it was not a moneymaker and jobs were hard to come by. However, I do know a couple single moms who are badass archaeologists. 

Anthropology is very complimentary with many other fields, including business and sales, because of how it teaches people to better understand other people. Perhaps you could minor in Anthro and use it to complement something else that you would enjoy if you are worried about employability. 

If all else fails, many states and cities in the US have archaeology societies that welcome avocational (people without degrees) and professional archaeologists alike. These groups have regular meetings and presentations and often organize volunteer excavations. Perhaps finding a group like this in your area can even help you with your decision. If you're in the southeast, PM me for some leads on these groups. 

Best of luck! It's a hard road, but if you know what you are getting into it can be a rewarding journey. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We had an awesome time!! The character interaction was wonderful (I have to say though I think it depends on how into it the guest is- you gotta give them something to work with people!), the food was AMAZING, and the atmosphere was spectacular (Sci Fi Dine-In).

We arrived for our 8:25 reservation with a few minutes to spare, checked in, and mingled with other guests while we waited to join the rebellion. Once your rebel cell is called, you join the line to meet [Darth Vader and Boba Fett](http://i.imgur.com/1mcxNdb.jpg). As you can guess from my outfit, I was not too popular with them! Fett liked my boyfriends' shirt though of course. Boba scanned me with his helmet eyepiece and tried to collect my bounty. He was also not impressed by my ears! Darth Vader went as far as taking my Chewbacca plushie, holding it up for the crowd to see, then turning back towards me and slowly and deliberate wringing his neck before dropping him on the floor while staring directly at me. Evil!

After you get your picture taken, the cast member hands each person a mini Lightsaber that can go either red or blue depending on which side you are on. At the table, (which are little cars from the 50's) you get your menu and the server goes to get your pastry starter. A pastry tray, fruit, beverage, and entree are all included in one price. The [pastry tray](http://i.imgur.com/wBRwqgi.jpg) had chocolate muffins, puff pastry Lightsaber sticks with red or blue sugar, Darth Vader Danish things and Princess Leia sticky buns. All delicious!
The fruit salad or parfait that you get next has a little melon Yoda on the top. The entrees all have cute Star Wars names, but the only one that looks special are the [Vader waffles](http://i.imgur.com/QG1TZyu.jpg) which were amazingly delicious! I washed everything down with a blue milk (kinda blue raspberry flavored). The cast member who checked us in at our hotel mentioned we could keep ordering as many entrees as we wanted, but we found that one entree was plenty of food.

The screen at Sci Fi was playing Star Wars clips the entire time and whenever the cantina band music came on, the jawas and Stormtroopers all danced. [I traded with the Jawas](http://i.imgur.com/3VKH1zS.jpg] (they swindled me!), convinced the [Storm Troopers](http://i.imgur.com/yAGUrPJ.jpg) we were not the diners they were looking for, and [apologized to Greedo](http://i.imgur.com/qBpxvVp.jpg) for the incident in Mos Eisley so he would take a picture with me. When we left, Boba Fett almost followed me out the door to make sure I left. All in all, it was an amazing experience that I am so glad we were able to do. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Star Wars Galactic Dine-In Breakfast Report </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-11 02:57:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We had an awesome time!! The character interaction was wonderful (I have to say though I think it depends on how into it the guest is- you gotta give them something to work with people!), the food was AMAZING, and the atmosphere was spectacular (Sci Fi Dine-In).

We arrived for our 8:25 reservation with a few minutes to spare, checked in, and mingled with other guests while we waited to join the rebellion. Once your rebel cell is called, you join the line to meet [Darth Vader and Boba Fett](http://i.imgur.com/1mcxNdb.jpg). As you can guess from my outfit, I was not too popular with them! Fett liked my boyfriends' shirt though of course. Boba scanned me with his helmet eyepiece and tried to collect my bounty. He was also not impressed by my ears! Darth Vader went as far as taking my Chewbacca plushie, holding it up for the crowd to see, then turning back towards me and slowly and deliberate wringing his neck before dropping him on the floor while staring directly at me. Evil!

<TEXT> I was tempted to make a throwaway, since the institution I work for is dealing with a potentially hairy NAGPRA claim right now but I have to say that yes I do. I don't know if NAGPRA is the law you are referring to (and I don't have much knowledge of legislation in other countries) but I do support reburial. I also support scientific study of remains. I know from personal experiences that compromises can be made that allow for study and documentation prior to repatriation.

Also, I can't think of a single example where remains in a historic context were not reinterred as soon as practical. Historic cemeteries are always moved if the archaeology is done right. I don't see why this same attitude does not get applied to prehistoric remains that lack a cultural association. They're still people! </TEXT>

<TEXT> So waaaay back in my first Pokemon game (Yellow) one of the members of my team was Nidoking. I didn't have any water types on my final crew I guess so I taught my Nidoking Surf because he could learn it for some reason. Ever since, in FR and HG and just today in X my Nidoking on my team has known Surf. 3

I think my first team was Pikachu, Nidoking, Scyther, Charizard, Articuno ... and someone else. I can't remember the sixth pokemon. ;-; EDIT- Haunter. I think it was Haunter.

What sorts of things do you carry over game to game? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm leaning towards the new 3DS since it has better everything compared to the other models you can get new, although the colors don't excite me. :/

I think I am gonna go for Pokemon Y to start with although I eventually want Alpha Sapphire too.

Are there any bundles I should look for? Is it better to get the cartridge or download the game digitally? [I would cry if my pokes became corrupted]

Also, how easy is it for me to send mons from Diamond or HG or Black?

Thanks y'all! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi everyone, I have a couple character meals that traditionally include photos (whether you have MM or not) and I just read on a different forum conflicting reports about whether they stopped this at the beginning of the year or not. The ones I have booked are Akershus and Star Wars Galactic Breakfast. I'll be so disappointed to not get photos. :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> The gameplay is very similar. The graphics, 'mons, and physics are updated of course and there are a couple more things to interact with on the table. Also Spoink shoots your pinball so you can control the speed of the ball, something which the original version lacks. Two thumbs up can recommend.

Does not rumble though. :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> My boyfriend and I are going for our first trip together in May! 3 (70 days!!)

We are staying at POP Century and checking in on May 5th. Our first night there we are having dinner at Boatwrights at Port Orleans Riverside. Following that, my plan is to head over to the Polynesian for a Lapu Lapu at the Tambu Lounge while we watch Wishes from the beach. Then back home, since we have an early day the next day!

May 6th we have booked the Star Wars Galactic Dine In Character Breakfast at Hollywood Studios for 8:25 AM! I am SO EXCITED about this! My fastpasses for HS will include Toy Story, Tower of Terror and Star Tours. I'd also like to see the Indiana Jones Stunt Spectacular and MuppetVision 3D.

We are then park hopping to Epcot where we will drink and snack our way around the world showcase and flower and garden festival. Hopefully we can also ride Spaceship Earth! We have dinner reservations at Akershus after which we will find a spot for IllumiNations. RIGHT AFTER IllumiNations we will beat it to the Monorail and head to the Magic Kingdom. Hopefully we will arrive in time for Wishes! Seeing it from the Monorail height is pretty awesome. Finally, we will catch the Electric Parade then call it a night.

May 7 we will get up SUPER EARLY for EMH at the Magic Kingdom! I plan on filling myself with Mickey Waffles at the POP restaurant. Then we will try and get to the park in time for the opening show! My plan is to FP+ Peter Pan, 7 Dwarves, and Buzz Lightyear. I plan to head to Space Mountain first thing, do Buzz, then turn around and do Pirates, Haunted Mansion, then spend most of our time in Fantasyland getting all the major rides. We currently have lunch reservations for Tony's, but I am crossing my fingers I will be able to get Be Our Guest tomorrow! We will finish our day in the Magic Kingdom with the new Fantasy Parade.

After that, we will head back to Hollywood Studios! We will do any shows we missed the day before, Rockin Rollercoaster, Star Tours AGAIN! Then, we have dinner reservations at 50's Prime Time Cafe after which we can hopefully grab a seat at Fantasmic! Then finally we will head home and get to sleep in a little hehe.

May 8 we have a late AM breakfast reservation at Olivia's at Old Key West. Then we will take a boat to Downtown Disney where we will look around and shop. We have a late lunch reserved at Fulton's and dinner reservations at Raglan Road. We also have tickets to see Nightwish and Sabaton at House of Blues! :D

May 9- Checkout day. :( I want to walk over the bridge to see Art of Animation and have breakfast or lunch there before we leave.

We are celebrating our 1st Anniversary as a couple and are so excited. 3 </TEXT>

<TEXT> Absolutely. Although, I must say I only use Photoshop/Illustrator/InDesign out of the suite, so I can only comment on those. I was working at home on a magazine layout for work recently and the XPS navigated the file better than the 6 months old 27 inch iMac I have at work. I missed the big screen though hehe. I have not tried processing HUGE raster files with the XPS yet though. Just edited a batch of photos here at work and the response time was great. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So none of those look Paleo to me. They look Archaic/Woodland but it really depends on the part of the country they came from (context context context!) See if the historical society or one of your professors will help you get it recorded in the state site file. Or even better, perhaps there is a nearby professional firm that can help get it recorded. 

The thing is, the actual stuff you found may be cool and all, but it's a lot more useful to the scientific community when we can study the relationships between the artifacts and any features that may have been present. Remember, you can't put it back once its excavated! </TEXT>

<TEXT> "It is very likely that at least some degree of Ebola virus transmission currently occurs via infectious aerosols generated from the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory tract, or medical procedures, although this has been difficult to definitively demonstrate or rule out, since those exposed to infectious aerosols also are most likely to be in close proximity to, and in direct contact with, an infected case,"

Yep so people will be fear mongering with this even though the scientists admitted it was impossible to control for.

Also

Thursday's study examines the idea that minuscule droplets of body fluid containing the virus could hang in the air and be inhaled by others, providing an unrecognized, if minor, pathway for the virus.

Not the same thing as an Ebola mutated to be airborne! </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my experience, I have observed that we get a lot of questions about what it is like to be an archaeologist. Which tells me that like most scientists, we are not so great at communicating what it is we do exactly with the general public.

As a general rule, archaeology is not sexy and I have never seen it portrayed accurately in a film for this reason. For something closer to accurate, think "Scrubs" except with shovels. Most archaeologists work project to project, usually on something related to infrastructure. These projects are conducted in advance of construction projects making use of federal funds. Very rarely does anyone go looking for something in particular (because of confirmation bias for one thing) because archaeology is EXPENSIVE when you do it right, which includes proper excavation and reporting techniques. There is no quick way to earn respect but shitty excavation practices and bad ethics is a hell of a way to lose it.

I'm fortunate enough to be salaried at a major American university, but that also means I no longer do much digging. My main focus is on public education. 

Best of luck with your project!

Also, we as a whole have zero fashion sense. Jeans, a button down and boots with most of the dirt knocked off is professional attire. I love it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it has more to do with certain State fans thinking their football program was better because it jumped to FBS after one season. We never played each other until 2014 and apparently that made us Eagles look like we were 'scared.'

This was then further exacerbated by clueless announcers calling Georgia Southern Georgia State on multiple occasions. [Friendly PSA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=putYM15zC0Y) </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello friends. I am trying to determine if I am making a HUGE mistake. I think I have decided to risk NOT FP+ing Toy Story Midway Mania. I know, I know! Let me explain.

We have an 8:25 AM Galactic Dine In Star Wars Breakfast Reservation at the Sci Fi Dine In Restaurant for May 6. The park opens at 9. Since I can either FP+ Toy Story or the Rockin Roller Coaster, I think I am going to chance it and take the Roller Coaster since we are so close to Toy Story in the park. I don't want to rush through the breakfast either though so I guess my question is, how soon after 9 AM does the line become unbearable for Toy Story? I have done it before, and it was WONDERFUL and my SO has never done it (and I know he would love it). 

What do you think? Thanks in advance and may the force be with you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Background: I make less than 25K, single lady with no kids. I am not in school, I work full time for a public university. GREAT benefits. 

I owe $470 on my tax return. This is a substantial amount of money for me, and it's going to decimate the small savings I have managed to put by. Last year, I got a small refund. My income and withholding, as stated, has not changed. I'm confused and sad. :( 

I just put everything through a Federal Free Edition on Turbotax, and my only credit was for Student Loan Interest. 

TLDR: ELI5 why it's different so I don't get pissy and mail off a bunch of pennies. Please and thank you. 3

Edit- Changed deduction to credit </TEXT>

<TEXT> You have to cancel these at least 24-48 hours in advance, so maybe someone is sitting on a reservation until it gets closer and they have to really decide which they want. Keep trying! I was able to make one last week for breakfast on May 6 so it could definitely happen! Keep trying and May the Force Be With You. </TEXT>

<TEXT> OK I'm gonna use Alabama, because I work there. [They had eight players drafted in 2014](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Alabama_Crimson_Tide_players_in_the_NFL_draft).

Their starting kicker, Cade Foster, was not among them. He is now a free agent. 

Players like that, who don't get drafted yet expected to. What kind of a future can they look forward to? What's the likelihood they will get picked up? Do they have skills they can fall back on if not? I'm legitimately concerned. The graduation - employment rate is low enough as it is. I should know I am a (gainfully employed!) recent anthropology grad. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Georgia Southern was barred from postseason FCS games last year because of the transition, but that was a team wide application. 

This page has some good info for individual athletes.

<TEXT> I believe that just such a situation is what the rule was created to prevent. 

However Georgia Southern has zero transfers and significantly less scholarships than other sunbelt teams, which is why we are appealing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, the stupid rule thing is my main argument. We have met (and exceeded) all the FBS qualifications. We wouldn't have made the transfer if we didn't. I'm bummed out that we are the only conference champs whose season is (probably) already over. I'm bummed out for the senior players who stuck it through the transition, beat Florida in the Swamp, earned an undefeated conference championship, and now have to watch teams they beat go play on the national stage instead. Give me a ONE MORE TIME!!  :) </TEXT>
