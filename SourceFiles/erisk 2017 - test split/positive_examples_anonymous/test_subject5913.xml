<TEXT> Man, I plan on moving to SLC, Utah, once I having the funds. I'm a freelance artist, but since I'm not getting any work, I'm gonna have to a get a "real" job. Hearing what you said really worries me. Do you think, if I ever get a job interview, that I should lie, if I'm subtly asked about my religion and say I'm Mormon?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me, it's all of the different sounds. For example, the droid that answers the door to Jaba's Palace, it just sounds cool! I love that different droids sorta have their own indistinguishable languages. It makes some of them sound gritty and depth to their worlds. Another sound I enjoy is when a big ship, like a cruiser, is heavily under attack, or very badly damaged, they make that sorta "arooga" sound(I hope that makes sense. That's what I hear, at least). Lastly. hearing the range of emotion in R2's beeps. 
I love it!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Are there any driving schools in SLC? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-10 17:42:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I plan on moving to SLC, in a few months, but need to take care of things. Like, getting a job and an apartment. But I don't want to get a job without have my own transportation. I'm 21 and I don't know how to drive, nor do I have my license. This is causing me a lot of anguish, because I lived the past three years in NJ without a car, so walking to school was a nightmare, especially during the winter.  I'm tired of walking everywhere or having to spend money on cabs, or rely on people for rides. I don't know anyone in SLC, so I definitely can't rely on anyone for a ride. 
Is learning to drive expensive? And since I'm 21, would I still have to drive six months with someone older than 25 before I can get a real license? That was a law in NJ. I'm not sure if it's the same over here.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe sometime in the future, but as of right now, no. I like to move on to other illustrations. Like I said, this was a study. I'm not the most masterful painter in the world, nor do I have a ton of experience under my belt. I've never been the best at capturing likenesses, but this is a much better improvement that I've seen in my work. I definitely could not paint this well, three years ago.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Does life get any better after high school and college? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-21 19:36:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm having a hard time believing it does. I've been diagnosed with depression, this past April but I've been living with it since 2008( when I started high school). It got worse once my mother died and when my closest friends and I went our separate ways once we graduated high school. There are a lot of other factors that's causing my depression( being attracted to women, wishing I was born a man, wishing I wasn't black, never being intimate with someone) which has caused me to gain so much weight. Since I graduated from my trade school, last month, I tried to start working out, but stop because of a terrible pain in my lower back and left leg. That really messed with my head. I want to get better, but it's like my body doesn't want me to. My anxiety prevents me from going outside. I feel very ashamed to be seen outside. I live in Germany with my dad( we're American). I don't want to be seen by people because I always get stared at, it makes me feel worse about myself. I know Europeans(or anyone, really) don't like fat people, so I hate myself so much for what I am. I want to get better, get in shape, but I feel so hopeless. All my friends are married, having children, and here I am, the loneliest I've ever been in my life. I don't know if I can make it, any longer. </TEXT>

If I go to the gym ,how do I know, no one's going to take photos of me and post them on some place like reddit, to mock me? I see that happening a lot. It really terrifies me :/

This sounds really silly, but stuff like this, and other horrible things I've read on reddit, (i.e r/fatpeoplehate or r/talesoffathate. Yes, I'm not in shape, and I know people are certainly not attracted to overweight folks) has definitely effected my self esteem. 
I'm just curious to know what you guys think.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm gonna be moving to Salt Lake City late May/early June and I'm currently looking for an apartment. There are a few places that I would like to live because they are near stores and the rent is fairly cheap. I don't have a car or license, so it's crucial that I find a place with lots of public transportation. I found a place with really cheap rent in South Salt Lake. The apartment complex is called "La Porte Properties Apartments, this is the address:2505 South State, Salt Lake City, UT 84115. I looked at the place on google maps, street view, but from what I saw, it really doesn't seem like a nice place. Not bad, but not nice. I couldn't really find if there was a trax line(I believe that's what it's called) anywhere. I couldn't find any shopping centers anywhere near the place, either. For someone who doesn't have a car, is this not a good place to live?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Man, I really dislike all of the hate Claire is getting, this season, too. I really don't think it's hard for people to change, like Claire has been doing. She was ruthless the first two seasons, but not a psychopath like Frank. Which is why I think the writers has been showing more of her humanity, this season, despite how many mishaps she's been having. People make mistakes. I don't think she  has what it took to be an ambassador( which was clear, throughout the season) and she obviously knew that. All the pressure just got to her, you know? If any of you were in her situation, the same would happen to you. 
Besides, I think it's incredibly bad writing to just have the main characters come out on top, all of the time. That gets boring. A great example of this is the character Superman. He's completely overpowered. Yes, he has kryptonite to slow him down, but he's a very boring character because he's practically unstoppable. So, I think it's great that Claire and Francis hasn't been succeeding, this entire season. Otherwise it would just get predictable.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pretty neat, show. 
Well, that's an understatement. 
It's a gorgeous looking show; well written and well acted. I see in the title credits that David Fincher is an executive producer. Makes sense. His movies seem to have somewhat of the same aesthetic as this show. Meaning, his movie and the show seem to have the same color pallet. The mutes blues, yellows and oranges, which I love. This show is gorgeously lit. I'm not sure if Fincher has some of his film crew working on the show or not, but I feel like I'm watching a Fincher movie, with every episode. 
I know it's too late in the game for this, seeing as the show has established a feel, but I would honestly love for Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross to score the show. Their work for Gone Girl is my favorite body of work. 
House of Cards is good television.  </TEXT>
