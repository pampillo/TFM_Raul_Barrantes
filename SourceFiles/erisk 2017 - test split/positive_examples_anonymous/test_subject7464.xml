<TEXT> Watching the SEA Games broadcast earlier, there was an interview with Quah Ting Wen and Quah Zheng Wen and they were asked to describe each other. Man, all the #siblinggoals feels. They both seem to be really pleasant and easy-going people too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This sounds like a troll though. But if it isn't, then *shakes head* 

However, I have come across a number of fellow Chinese singaporeans making comments like "not that I am racist but Malays are lazier"...(context: when recruiting people I have met HR people and hiring managers that judge Malays just for being Malays even before the interview)

I get very upset at such statements, especially coming from otherwise seemingly civilised "nice" people.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I found 1 in my soup at dinner today, 1 crawling wingless on the dining table and 2 more flying around. Was wondering what they were... 

My dad says that they're termites that appear when it's going to rain but...it hasn't rained yet. We shall see... </TEXT>

<TEXT> This was really interesting, I really really enjoyed reading it :)
2 questions...Why did you decide to go into this field?
Also, you mentioned the poor recognition level for your job...how much does this bother you and how do you think things could be done to change this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I work in HR (maybe it's because of my job nature but I am really enjoying reading everyone's responses here, so felt like I had to jump in to say something)

The good: when my staff are happy, are committed to the job and perform well, especially those that I've personally recruited. It's immensely satisfying! I brought in one staff who had a splotchy resume filled with career gaps, earning quite low for his age   qualifications...but we gave him a chance and now he's excelling in his job, has a bright future with the company and progression in his career to look forward to. 

The bad: when my staff aren't happy in their jobs, for whatever reason. Cliched, but true. Mostly, the reasons people are unhappy are beyond the HR function's capacity, but some staff seem to think that HR should be able to magically solve all their issues for them....quite often it's due to horrible bosses and I secretly think many of the management level staff in my company are incompetent. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a somewhat native speaker (I grew up bilingual, with English being the slightly more preferred language), I must say that  is a word that I've never really had to use, as compared to 
My take would be that  seems more like an adjective to describe a thing or person as being spontaneous but  is used more like an adverb to modify a verb? That's why I would say  fits better into your sample sentence. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Why has none of his children being chosen to be groomed ? 

Good question, I've just realised that I don't even know who his children are! Are they even in public service? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well if they already like you right off the bat then that's all good, text away all you like. :) I can't speak for all girls, but I seldom ever like a guy right from the start to feel comfortable enough texting them at length before we've gone on a couple of dates and have gotten to know each other better.  

Also, I find that certain nuances in speech get lost in text messages so if you don't know each other well enough yet, some of the stuff you're trying to say won't come across to her the way you meant it, and vice versa. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Don't pursue her through texts, use texts to arrange meet ups. Texts can easily be misinterpreted and not to your advantage.

I'm a girl and cannot agree more with this. I personally don't like texting someone I barely know at length and many of my friends feel the same way. Face-to-face is the way to go!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Came across [this woman's account of her attack](http://dayre.me/davienne/pLKsQpVoUr). She's also a young Singaporean in he mid-twenties and similarly, her attacker was a cyclist that came across her on a walkway at night.

Thanks for sharing your experience. Reading both of your accounts has reminded me that I should not take it for granted that Singapore is a relatively safe place. Heck, i walk home past midnight along dimly-lit walkways quite often without batting an eyelid. Not sure if I'd dare to do so anymore.  </TEXT>
