<TEXT> I don't really give a shit who I tell. I mean I don't just go around telling everyone, I have to know them enough to be generally comfortable. But if I'm feeling depressed and someone asks me what's wrong I'll tell them that I have depression and want to just be alone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm terribly sorry to see this. No one deserves this pain. I'm experiencing something fairly similar unfortunately. I was with this amazing girl, we were fantastic. I knew she had depression and other issues, but I wasn't ready for her to get depressed then break up with me because she didn't feel able to be with someone. I've unfollowed her on Facebook but every once in a while I can't stop myself from looking and every time I look I experience heart shattering pain. She doesn't advertise relationships on Facebook, or her feelings all that much for that matter but when I look I'm just crushed that she isn't experiencing things with me. But this happened before and she may come back to me like she did before, but until that happens I'm afraid I'll feel this way. This extreme feeling of love and missing her. To make it worse, this all began when my depression and anxiety starting to really "bud" if you will.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My job isn't necessarily cognitively demanding, but it's more demanding than me sitting my room feeling depressed. So I use it exactly as you described the potential use for tasks. I even go to work like an hour early because when I'm at work I don't have the time to feel depressed, and it's a good distraction from my depression. Granted, the idea breaks down when we have slow night. I work in a restaurant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I deal with this practically everyday. Everyday it's a struggle. Honestly, what I do is just tell myself that I need to. I might have nothing to to do that day, but to be a real member of society I need to get the fuck out of bed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Should probably use a throwaway, but who gives a shit? A similar thing happened to me about a month ago, and a few months ago, but with a twist. This beautiful, amazing girl and I went on a few dates. Then she disappeared. I messaged her saying I understood if she didn't want to see me and that I would respect it, but she told me that she had depression and was into in pretty bad and she disappears when this happens to her. Then a couple months later we got together and dated for about a month and a half..then she disappeared. Long story short is that I think I scared her away by trying to see her to comfort her, and because she was my gf and I wanted to see her. Sorry this became a long story but it's making shit worse for me and I ended up venting it here. But to relate it to you, when things got better for this girl I dated she came back to me. Your friend will probably do the same. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually respect Frank a great deal. He does what the fuck he wants and gets what he wants despite all obstacles. This doesn't change the fact that he's an awful human being though. I think that one thing the show does really well is showing that despite him being an awful person we all want to be like Frank, at least a little bit. Everyone wants to be strong willed, intelligent, cunning, clever and ambitious. But everyone also wants to be a good person, unlike Frank. Frank doesn't give a fuck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If over time waves lose energy and speed, does that mean that there are separate sections for waves of separate wavelengths? I'm thinking this because if if an X-ray were to lose energy over time and become a radio wave,  wouldn't it be moving at the same rate as all other radio waves created near the same time? Then over time, wouldn't there be a huge difference in the number of radio waves and all other wavelengths? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I met him as well. I was really young, 5 or 6 maybe and he was shooting a movie near where I lived so my dad brought me over there and told me  "That's the Genii from Aladdin!!". I, being a 5 year old, immediately ran over to meet him. As I was running over, a van with some sort of film equipment was coming by and was going to hit me. Robin yelled at the same time as my dad for me to stop. Robin Williams saved my life, then afterward, we had a little conversation about watching for cars. Meanwhile, my stupid older brother sat in the car and listened to music. </TEXT>
