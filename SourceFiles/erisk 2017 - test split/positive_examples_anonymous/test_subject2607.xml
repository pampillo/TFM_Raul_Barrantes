<TEXT> I'm an indie and alternative rock girl, and although I usually don't admit it, I also know how to rock out to Kanye, Childish Gambino, Kendrick Lamar, and Frank Ocean.

I'm a very shy and quiet person, but in my first hour Spanish class, I talk a lot and make a lot of jokes, even though I don't have any friends in that class. No idea why I'm so comfortable in that class. Maybe it's the teacher.

I'm a band student, and most students have that "band kids are great we stick together" mentality, but I think a lot of band kids are really annoying and have huge egos and are sort of douche bags. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Kind of. Loved this dude to no end, then we broke up. And he straight up told me he doesn't like me as more than a friend anymore after about a year of us still having feelings after we broke up. Now he's talking to me less and less and obviously trying to get away from me and it breaks my heart because I can feel him slipping away and I can't handle that. As melodramatic as it sounds I've been flirting a lot with other guys lately, because I figure that if I give myself to guys that don't matter then I'll forget the only one that does. My friends hate him, his friends hate me. We fought a lot and at one point this summer he was being such a dick to me that I told him I was done and I wasn't gonna talk to him anymore. That lasted about a week. Then I smoked weed once in like, September after I promised him I wouldn't (he's really against drugs and alcohol), and then texted him high off my ass. Basically after a spell of us being really good with each other, I broke it and he said "I broke the best bond we've ever had with each other." Then he ran off and his friends found him at the smoke shop because "if she's gonna stoop that low then so am I." And nothing has been the same since then. I love this guy to no end, he's the only thing I ever think about, and he's pushing me away, and I think about it and it just makes my entire body hurt because I know it's completely over and won't happen again. Sorry for the wall of text, but I started typing and it felt good to let it out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well. The college admissions people for the school that I emailed (and really want to go to) we're rude as hell to me. My friend that I kinda have feelings for didn't text me back all day. My other friend who always asks for nudes and who I always say no to because I don't do that decided that he doesn't want to be my friend if I won't send him nudes. So, it was a day. But at least I aced my Spanish test. That was cool. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "You'll find more and more peace with Dad, and you won't always cry every night about it. It will get easier. About 2 years from now you'll accidentally come across a boy who breaks your heart over and over again and you still care about him. He cycle started because you were the first to let him go. Don't do that. It will be tough, but stick with him because he's worth it. Stay motivated in school, because in 3 years you'll be in your AP classes regretting the times you could barely pass 8th grade math because you were lazy. Just look to the future and keep your goals in mind. Tell Mom you love her. Hang in there. It gets easier."

<TEXT> I live in Michigan, which is a state that requires the ACT, and very few people take the SAT. I'm trying really hard to get into UMich, and I'm wondering if taking the SAT would look good, and if it would make it seem like I'm motivated and diligent. To take the SAT here, it costs money and isn't required or even necessarily encouraged at my school, so I assume that most of the applicants only take the ACT. Would it be to my advantage to take both, or is it more trouble than it's worth? </TEXT>

I don't need to go visit her or think about her because it's like she's right next to me again. You're both so dedicated to what you do, and you both make an effort to be kind to everybody." And I cried </TEXT>

<TEXT> This might be a stretch, but there's this classic rock song that I know the rhythm of the chorus to, but I can't remember the lyrics or the name. It's really heavy rock and the chorus sounds really loud. It's one of those songs that everyone knows and has heard, like when I heard it at a dance the other day everyone was singing along. I had thought the lyrics were "You.. give me aaaaall I need" but it doesn't look like those are it. Sorry this is so vague, but it's been bothering me to no end.

<TEXT> One thing I notice is that a lot of places and people on the internet really glorify mental illness and depression and self harm. Tumblr especially doesn't shut up about how your scars are beautiful and that mental illness is just this thing for misunderstood moody teenagers. Obviously we shouldn't be criticizing people who have mental illness or have self harmed, but we make it seem like this thing that makes you unique or different or misunderstood when in reality it's awful and doesn't make you feel special. I think that might contribute to it in teenagers especially. It's glorified. </TEXT>

The whole team is really obsessed with that shade of green for some reason, the lights on our robot were that same bright green and it got us the imagery award at Waterford this year. And we adopted the team name and logo from our school, since we wanted to be integrated within the school. So the captain head is the main logo on our shirts and we incorporated it into our rebound rumble robot, also getting us the imagery award.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My mom. Had a borderline mentally abusive mother, and ended up dropping out of college because she couldn't afford it. Met her fair share of abusive guys before my dad. They had me then got divorced but still stayed best friends, even though he was in and out of jail, but then he passed away almost 3 years ago. So she had to raise me almost completely on her own since I was 2, and even though her life had all of these issues, she doesn't dwell on them and she devotes all her time and energy making sure we're happy and comfortable. She never gave up on me, and despite everything she's been through, she's a damn good mother, and I hope to be half the woman she is some day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But that's implied. It's the REASON for dress codes. A lot of schools don't enforce dress codes for boys like they do for girls. At mine, guys can have tank tops with the arm holes so big their nipples are showing, but a girl can't have a tank top with thin straps. As stated above, it is understandable if your ass or boobs are hanging out, but it's ridiculous to send girls home for things like thin straps or lots of thigh showing because it *distracts the poor boys* </TEXT>

I'd love to see a version of myself that isn't scared of social situations and that could talk to people my age without feeling awkward and walking away. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The build process on my team is very student-led. I think that the thing the mentors help with the most is designing the robot. While the mentors help on some things that they feel are dangerous for students to do, they try very hard to let us do the majority of the build. Usually when you have a question, the mentors will not give you a direct answer. They ask what you think the answer is and they walk you through the steps to get to the correct answer. I would rather have a robot that doesn't win a whole lot that is built all by students than have a robot that wins everything but was made by the mentors. I wouldn't feel like I could take as much credit since my team didn't actually build it, my mentors did. Granted, my team has 45 students and with that amount of people, we can work efficiently build a robot in 6 weeks. With smaller teams more mentor involvement is necessary in my opinion, because there are less people to give out their ideas and less people to work on the robot. I think that if the mentors did most of the work on the robot, it would almost be defeating the purpose of FIRST. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have an ex boyfriend who is currently living across the country who I still try to help and support to no end and yet his friends still all hate me. He was just in the hospital, and his friends all gave up on him feeling better, and got mad at ME for staying positive and saying he would make it. Guess who got out of the hospital earlier this week? Him. While he was there, one of his friends told me "The reason he hasn't given up yet is because you don't want him to" After I tried telling him how much he was still needed and how he couldn't give up. The same thing happened in December. I broke up with him in a pretty bad way back in December and I have apologized sincerely, and I've even been TOLD that they all have forgiven me. Yet they still can't stand me and I've done nothing but try to help him and stay close friends with him. His friends are some of the most fantastic and protective and caring people I have ever talked to, and there have been times after we have broken up where I can joke with his friends and be extremely friendly, but that won't happen again anytime soon. The whole hospital situation really drew the "they really can't stand me" line, even though I supported every single one of them the best I could. We have stayed very close since we broke up, and I still love him. I don't think I could ever get back together with him though because I'm not very emotionally stable sometimes and don't trust myself with him. Additionally, our personality clashes have been really evident as of late. I'm an open book, and he hates talking about his feelings. I sometimes find It hard not to try to pry when I notice things are wrong. It caused a REALLY awful argument last month, and up until then we would still say I love you to one another, but we didn't think we were ready for an actual relationship again. As a couple, we never had those problems. If he ever offered a relationship again, I would tell him I would think about it, but as I think about it and am honest with myself, I realize how likely it is that I would actually get back together with him. Honestly, I still cry on a pretty regular basis when I realize how badly I fucked up by breaking up with him, and I was told a few weeks ago that he still kind of has feelings for another girl, and I felt really awful about that too. I'm not going to even try to talk to him for at least a couple of weeks. Things still need to cool down between me and his friends, and I think it's healthier for me to not try to talk to him. But god damn, do I love and miss him. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know it's not something people can just "get over" because it's an actual personality trait. But I am really introverted and I feel like it holds me back a lot. Like, I'm in robotics and marching band and sometimes I feel so alone and like I'm an outcast, then I realize it's my own fault. I'm terrified to talk to people, and when I do it's incredibly awkward. I have friends that I can be myself around, but lately I've been pushing them all away. I never feel like hanging out or texting them. I just want to sit in my room alone and listen to music or read all the time, and I know that's not how I should be spending my time. I should be out having fun with my friends, but I just don't feel like it. I know I'll never be perfect at socializing and having friends, but I really need ways to stop the antisocial and extremely introverted tendencies I have. Does anyone have any advice? I'm so done with being alone all the time because I don't know how to socialize. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends on what she's into, but my (now ex) boyfriend wanted to take me to homecoming really badly this year but I was really opposed to it, as I hate big dances and large gatherings of hormone-filled teenagers in the same room. So we just agreed that we would go out for a nice dinner then go back to his house. He knew I always liked just cuddling on the couch watching a movie better than going out somewhere. Then when he drove me home from dinner he went in the house first and told me to wait a second and that he would text me when I could come in, because he had a surprise. Then when I came in there was this song playing that we always listened to together and he was wearing a nice suit and he just grabbed me and started dancing with me. It was super nice and made me feel like I wasn't missing out. If your girlfriend is into cheesy romantic stuff like that then she might like being surprised with her own little "mini-prom" from you. Really though, it takes the right kind of person to enjoy it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ohh yeah, it was pretty bad. Me and a few other people on the team said it was because the wrong team was losing. But ah well, we ended up winning anyway, even though that was a pretty infuriating rematch, lol. By the way, we love 573 :3 3 </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wish I had a video of the lights coming loose. At the end of the day, the red alliance ended up winning, but at this point in finals we had one loss against a powerhouse alliance, and were pretty excited to have almost won, and I think the fact that we replayed it when there were 6 seconds left was a little bit unnecessary.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> At the Waterford competition, during the second final match, [part of the LED strip came off of the high goal](http://www.flickr.com/photos/danielernst/13521802593/in/set-72157643084658745/) when the red alliance was ahead by a good 40 points, with **6 seconds** left on the clock. Understandably, they had to restart the match. Needless to say, we were all pretty mad. Has this happened anywhere else? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well personally I'm against it. I had an ex who ended up in a coma and kept waking up for a few minutes at a time (it was bizarre, he was dead about 5 times). And every time he woke up, he said he wanted to die. He woke up for good, and he has some issues now but he's almost back to normal. When he was telling me about it, he said that if assisted suicide was an option, he would have jumped on it in a second just because he was in pain and was upset just at the time. He still has depression and isn't in the best state, but he isn't suicidal anymore. He said he's so glad that he didn't end up dying. Miracles like that happen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm currently a sophomore in high school, but if I play my cards right, I'll be able to graduate as a junior. I realized how much I needed to begin looking at colleges. I want to be a chemist for sure, so my mom told me that MTU is a good school for students studying the sciences, but I had it in my head that it was based mainly on engineering. MTU has been one of my top choices since I started researching colleges more, but my question is how much they focus on the sciences, mainly chemistry. Thank you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Be a brave woman!" Lol easier said than done ;P But sometimes he sits with a couple other people and they simultaneously listen to music or read and I vaguely know one of them so I might just say one day that I didn't feel like sitting with my other friends and he's the only other person in my lunch that I really know. That sounds like a decent plan but omg I'm already stressing out  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't live just with him, I lived with him and my mom until I was 3, then I saw him a few times a year and talked to him on the phone a lot because he had legal issues, but then when I turned about 11, I saw him almost every day and was with him a lot of the time. He passed away two years ago right when I turned 13. So I don't know. I'd be nervous to talk to my psychiatrist about it because I don't want to sound like one of those melodramatic teenage girls that think they have bipolar disorder, even though they're just hormones. </TEXT>

<TITLE> How can I become more outgoing and open? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-10-15 05:07:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello, I need help figuring out how to become more social. I know that lots of people just aren't social and that's okay, but it sucks always feeling left out because I'm too scared to talk to anyone. I'm a 15 year old girl, and even from a young age I've never been able to talk to other kids. I have a few really close friends that I can talk to easily, but with everyone else, it's a lost cause. Sometimes when I really want to say something to someone that I don't know well, I'll count to 10 and say it, but it always comes out in awkward stutters. I think my problem is that people will think I'm weird or they don't like me. Online, I'm able to talk to you guys super easily, but if we were face-to-face it would be all kinds of awkward. I know that everyone thinks I'm really nerdy, because I'm in marching band and get really good grades. Even in marching band though, I can only talk to a select few people. I always feel left out from the group, and it kind of sucks, because everyone else is so close. Do you guys have any tips that could help me with my social awkwardness? Because I can't take it anymore. </TEXT>

Show Name: Music Royale

Repertoire: Bicycle Race by Queen, Hit the Road Jack by Ray Charles, King Kong by Jimmy Castor, Hall of the Mountain King

Unfortunately, as you can probably tell, we don't compete and we're a show band. We just go to invitationals, festivals, and play at parades and football games. We are a very good band though. Straight 1's at festival for the past three years, we got first place from 150 bands at the Mackinaw City memorial day parade, and we're going to be in the Detroit Thanksgiving Day Parade on national television. Last time we went there we got first. I wish we competed though tbh. </TEXT>

He goes to the other high school in my district, so I only see him occasionally at marching band competitions and invitationals. He told my friend that he wanted to get back together with me, but I realized that he would hurt me like that again, so I just didn't talk to him. But I definitely have been moving on and thinking about other guys, and that has helped me. It was rough, but it is getting a lot better. Thank you. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My story </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-07-10 00:59:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am a teenage girl who has been dealing with depression and anxiety for about a year and a half. Cutting and suicidal thoughts are things I had issues with for a long time. Before I tell my story, I want to say that finding this, and looking at some of the posts, made me feel less alone. Feeling alone is all too familiar to everyone on this subreddit, and it's amazing that a group of people who are feeling the same things and battling the same things can come together to discuss and guide each other. That's beautiful.

Now for the my story. As a young child, I never fit in. I was always the weird fat girl, and living in a wealthy town full of girls with entitlement issues  didn't help. My mother is very down to Earth, and since it was only her and I living together, we didn't have much money. We were by no means poor, but I didn't live in a fancy house in a nice subdivision, nor did I wear designer brand clothes like all the other kids. My parents divorced when I was two, and my dad was in and out of prison. With all of this being said, I spent most of my time alone and playing by myself when I was little. I had no siblings and no friends to play with. 

Then when I was 10 or 11, about to start middle school, my mother made a spur of the moment decision to move to a town about 10 or 20 miles outside the one we were living in. I was not excited. There were some bad areas of the town, and it intimidated me. My mom tried to assure me that I'd make lots of new friends and that everyone would be nicer. I didn't believe her, because I believed that kids were mean, and that's just how it was. I had no idea that there really were nice kids out there. I started middle school and everything was well, and I was amazed when I wasn't made fun of on the first day. I was very introverted, and didn't have any friends until about halfway through the school year, when I started taking to Jessie, a beautiful trumpet player in my band class who I though was extremely cool. I am still friends with her today, and I met most of my other friends though the people that Jessie knew in elementary school. 6th and 7th grade were good, and while I wasn't popular, and was still "the weird fat girl" in some people's eyes, I had a group of friends that I loved. I was content. 

Then the summer before 8th grade, my father passed away due to a prescription drug overdose. I tried to avoid it, and pretend that it never happened, which only fueled my mourning. My father wasn't perfect, and there were points where I would only see him two or three times a year, but he loved me. He adored me. In the letters he sent to my the rest of my family, he never shut up about me. The thing that hurt me the most is that the last the we talked was on the phone, and I didn't tell him I loved him. As with all deaths, I mourned and then gradually moved on with my life. When 8th grade started, all was well, and I still had the same group of friends.

About halfway through the year, I developed a crush on a close friend, Brandon. He also came from a broken home, with a dead mother, an abusive father, and being in his grandparents' custody with his older brother. I told him, and in early March we started dating. I loved this boy. He was my first boyfriend, first kiss, and first everything. Being the naive young kid I was, we had sex. Because hey, if he's willing to have sex with me, that must mean he really loves me right? Well as you would expect, he broke up with me shortly afterwards, after coming on a vacation with my family and I for my birthday. About a week after my birthday, he randomly became very distant and would only talk to me briefly once every few days, where we used to FaceTime for hours and hours every day. Then one day I sent him a message and asked what was wrong, and after a short argument, he called me on FaceTime. He said he had to break up with me to "protect me" and we were both sobbing. I didn't hear from him for over a year. 

In all honesty, I never really got over him. I still have dreams about him on a nightly basis, and I think he was the thing that really fueled my depression. For once in my life, I felt a mutual love with one of my peers, and then it was gone. I now realize the he used me, and he was very controlling, but I loved him.  I spent weeks and weeks crying over the breakup, but of course, I started getting over it slowly but surely. That was my first experience with cutting. I was sad, and mad at myself, so I grabbed the dull knife from the kitchen and sawed at my arm until there was a swollen cut, with blood oozing out. It felt good. The physical pain distracted me from the mental pain, and for those moments, it relieved my stress. 

Through freshman year, cutting was an issue. I continued to earn good grades and smile, but in marching band, a close-knit group of friends, I felt like an outsider. Jessie made new upperclassmen friends, and I was the awkward weird girl who wouldn't talk to anyone. It got really bad in the winter, and those are when the thoughts got more hostile and I felt more alone. I began more and more to sit in my room alone and listen to music, and avoid everyone around me. It was the same routine at this point: wake up, go to school or pretend I was sick, then lay and bed and sulk. I began becoming anorexic, not eating for a couple days at a time. I have since gotten better with eating, although the thought still rises occasionally. I was put on Zoloft when I was 14 as well as attended therapy, and it helped for a while, but now I am falling back into that pit of loneliness. We quit therapy a few months ago because it became too much money for my mom to handle.

Being a teenager, I like to tell myself this is a phase, or a mere hormone imbalance, but at this point I know it's not. Nothing seems beautiful, and I can find sadness and despondence in most everything. I can't shake the lonely, worthless feeling constantly plaguing me, and I needed to tell my story to people who would understand and point me in the right direction. I really feel less alone now, and I can relate to so many of you. Thank you for reading this, and I look forward to being a supportive part of this subreddit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm considering getting a snake or a bearded dragon, but I have no idea where to start. I already have a cat and a small dog (who probably wouldn't care that much), and my cat will try to attack everything that moves. I'm surprised she hasn't gotten any of my fish yet, so my cat is a concern. I don't want to get anything that my cat could potentially harm. I'm sure I could find a weight or something to put on the cage, but I'd still worry. Anyhow, I live in a condo and I am gone for school everyday during the school year and my mom works. Our family also goes upstate a lot, sometimes for about a week at a time, so I would need something that would either be able to travel or that would be able to be alone for a few days. So I suppose my question is, what would be better for my situation: a snake or a bearded dragon? Also, if anyone recommends a snake, what kind? Any information at all would be appreciated, because I have no idea where to start. Thanks!3   </TEXT>

I can't remember why, but the son ends up killing himself and his dad starts going crazy, and I remember at the end he saw his son hanging in the hallway.

<TEXT> "In My Life" has been one of my favorite songs my whole life because I grew up on Beatles. Then my dad passed away when I was 13 and they played that at his funeral and it was the sweetest thing ever. Especially because he got me into The Beatles. It still makes me think of him to this day and that's why I still love the song so much. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sorry bro *virtual hugs* That's gotta suck. We both kinda sound like we're in the same boat. This guy asked out a girl about 2 or 3 weeks ago and she dumped him after twelve hours and to my knowledge, he's still single. The fact that she dumped him so fast kinda made me smile. Karma, ya know? I'd be a lot less upset with him if he didn't completely cut me off after he promised he didn't want to hurt me but he had to do it because he felt he would have ended up hurting me by the time even worse if we had kept dating. Which sounded like bull to me. and we could be friends. Really, whenever I tried to make things right or talk to him he ignored me and recently deleted me off Facebook. He also kissed another girl near the end of our relationship because they were both going through hard times but he said it didn't mean anything and I didn't find out til about 2 days after our breakup. Sorry I didn't mean to turn that into a rant. But message me sometime dude.3 Feel better. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Broke up with this guy about a month ago and I miss everything about him. Should I keep trying or back off? And how do I get over it? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-08-16 07:50:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm 14 years old and one month ago Saturday, my boyfriend (also 14) broke up with me. He said that he was under a lot of stress and was having family issues and that he didn't want to break up with me but he had to because he didn't want to end up hurting me. When he broke up with me, the both of us were just sobbing. Then fast forward about 3 days. I found out he kissed another girl who was raped recently while he was still with me. When I asked him about it, he said that I deserved to know the truth and he did but they were talking about what happened to her and they kissed without thinking, and he has no feelings for her and isn't dating her. I haven't tried talking to him since then and he hasn't tried talking to me, but today I broke and sent him a message on Facebook. It said "Hey, I know you're probably not really wanting to hear from me and idk if you're upset with me or anything but I've been kinda worried about you because of how you were last time we talked, and I just wanted to make sure you were okay. Are things going any better for you at all? /:" He didn't reply yet, but he hasn't been online and I just sent it about 5 hours ago. I was in tears for about the first week of our breakup, then the next two I was fine, and now I'm in pieces again. I saw a picture of him on facebook and legitimately started crying. This boy was my first kiss and my first real boyfriend. We went extremely far physically which is something I'm not proud of, but it's the past. We are going to different high schools this year as well, so I won't be able to see him during school either. I just miss him so much. I keep having dreams that I see him somewhere, and we make up, and everything is back to how it used to be. I just feel like I'm never going to get better. The only thing I want right now is to be able to see him and talk about things. I just need so much closure right now and I just want us to get back together and I want things to be how they used to be. I miss his smile, I miss cuddling with him while we listened to music, I miss Facetiming with him every single day for hours and hours. Reddit, how do I get over it? And should I keep trying to talk to him or should I back off? Thanks.

EDIT: Yeah. He didn't reply to my facebook message. It said that he saw it, but no reply. </TEXT>
