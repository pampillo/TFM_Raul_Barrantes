So I think its a good comparison  </TEXT>

<TEXT> i think it was an attempt to talk about an issue or is RDJ the only one allowed to talk about drug problems ? he's allowed to use it for positive 'i've turned it around publicity' but when its used for an agenda relating to a wider issue its not allowed, well since he's heard it a million times before maybe he should learn to act with a sense of dignity and decorum rather than confirming the primadona steroytype. I understand he gets personal questions a lot and it must be frustrating but it makes it worse if he gets it a lot and he acts this childish, have a sense of a workplace ethic, pretty embarrassing on RDJs part. 

What a joke.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Have depression and anxiety i've had it since i was 16-17 (I'm 21 now), i only started doing something about it in december because this is all i know so i didnt think anything was wrong, i thought everyone felt like this because i had no feeling of contentness to compare it too. got into a relationship and i still felt the same although i had some superficial happiness, i thought something must be wrong, got broken up with two days after christmas out of the blue after spending christmas with her family, my family was on holiday so i was left alone broken up with for the rest of the holidays. she lives next door and had the same circle of friends so i still had to see her everyday (i felt like this way before her so this isn't a my girlfriend broke up with me I'm so sad story) i started with counselling and medication to combat this depression started exersiing more and tried everything in the book, eventually to suicidal and tried hanging myself a bunch of time, got sent into a mental hospital for a week, got kicked out of my university house and banned from talking to all my "friends" and ex because of my 'behaviour' by which they mean my depression. now I'm left alone in a flat still suicidal, toy with the idea of killing myself every day, last night i spent 5 hours standing on a train platform trying to be brave enough to do it. 

this is the edited version maybe one day i'll write a directors cut.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys this isn't a forever alone post or anything but i've recently went through a break-up and i have kind of figured out that i don't have a lot of friends and i want to make some more. now i know how to socialise i consider myself funny-ish and i'm pretty friendly and caring but  the problem i have is making the first move or putting myself in a position to meet more people. basically i want to meet more people with the hope of making friends. I don't know what hobbies i could pick up or what to do in order to meet more people. if it helps I'm 21 and live in the uk. thanks for the tips and if this question gets posted a lot I'm sorry. i didn't know where else to go.  </TEXT>

P.S this is not a self deprecating post to get compliments or anything i genuinely need help at being friendly and sociable. thanks a lot </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm scared okay. I'm at uni in my second year all my friends are in their third (i had to stay and repeat second year while they all went on to third year) I'm lonely really lonely what am i gonna do next year i'm gonna have nobody i'm gonna have nobody of the people i've grown to love over uni. i feel bad for feeling like this is a problem people have actual problems in the world but this feels like a huge pit in my stomach. why would they keep in touch with me i feel like I'm recyclable  like all the other friends from school have have faded away despite efforts am i not worth keeping ? do they not love me as much as i love them ? when everyone else gets married and gets girlfriends why would i be included in the wedding party ? I'm scared of the future okay i still feel like i kid and i love that about myself i feel hopelessly alone like nobody seems to understand this might sound cliche but fuck it. I'm scared and alone everything about this scares me and in this society you're not a man if you talk about your feelings. i wear my heart on my sleeve yeah i cry i'm emotional but fuck it maybe i should bottle it. 

Thanks for reading this. even more thanks if it made sense.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> the cunts of this subreddit who can't take an obvious joke. the dickheads on here who make a beautifully subjective sport like football completely black white. Eg.  'Y pass was the best pass of all time' ' well i like X pass better' 'No your offence but you're wrong' so stupid. and plastic fans usually americans who don't have a fucking clue and pretend to know the in's and Out's of their clubs history and rivalries  do me a favour and fuck off back to the NBA. 
and Fuck the MLS its a terrible league i don't wanna read about 'why the MLS is an underrated league pattering for up votes from americans' </TEXT>

<TEXT> its going better on my arsenal save. i stormed the league in my first season and won the champions league (probably my proudest achievement) beating man united in the semis. however my second season was disaster made some wrong moves in the transfer window and ended up finishing 9th 
i got to the semis of the champions league the league cup and the fa cup all knocked out by man united ( I'm glad the old rivalry is back though) 
i somehow managed to keep my job and most of my important players. now I'm in my third season and I'm two points of top but I'm just targeting a top 4 finish.i have also had a lot of fun bringing my youth through dan crowley serge gnabry and a few others are now semi regulars. but yeah thats it at the moment  </TEXT>

<TEXT> i dont think its Xavis problem i think that since the 2010-2011 season the team hasn't evolved there main starting 11 has pretty much stayed the seam where as teams like bayern and dortmund have added strength in depth and have added a lot of players so they can progress Eg. dumping 42 goal striker mario gomez for mandzukic where as barca have added cesc and jordi alba the team hasn't progressed properly since that season </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think its great you have come here asking for help. But if i was you i would just learn by playing its a lot more satisfying identifying your own mistakes and learning from them and when you create successful tactics without any help or guides is very rewarding not to mention when you find that hidden gem that scores you 30 goals a season. trust me no guides and you will have a lot more fun. p.s enjoy the summer you're going to have a great time getting use to fm :)    </TEXT>
