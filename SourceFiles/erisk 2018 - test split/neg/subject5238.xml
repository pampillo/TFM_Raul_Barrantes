Then Merlin went to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and counselled him for to send for all the lords of the realm, and all the gentlemen of arms, that they should to London...And when matins and the first mass was done, there was seen in the churchyard, against the high altar, a great stone four square, like unto a marble stone; and in midst thereof was like an anvil of steel a foot on high, and therein stuck a fair sword naked by the point, and letters there were written in gold about the sword that said thus:Whoso pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil, is rightwise king born of all England. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ha yeah but I actually prefer it to be the same sword.  it works better that way.  but I appreciate that the stories malory copied down makes the distinction. 

fun fact: theres a second sword in the stone in malory's collection that belonged to sir balin, the knight of two swords, which he'd gotten from a damsel.  he was the only knight worthy enough to pull it from its sheathe.  and in a twist, he kept it though she asked for it back and this eventually led to his death  </TEXT>

<TEXT> At this point, Merlin supposedly arranged the test of the Sword in the Stone, which only the true king could draw. This sword is often confused with Arthurs most famous weapon, Excalibur, the legendary sword said to have magical powers. In fact that blade was given to Arthur later by the Lady of the Lake (a faery woman who appears in the stories), after the sword from the stone breaks during battle. </TEXT>

<TEXT> With it coming out in two weeks, wondering what you all are feeling.

it's got Guy Ritchie who's made classics like Snatch and Lock, Stock along with big Hollywood movies like Sherlock Holmes.

It's about the legend of King Arthur which has been ripe for another reimagining.  I enjoyed the last historical approach with Clive Owen but am more excited for this as this seems to take it back to its fantasy roots mixed with Game of Thrones and Guy Ritchie's style.

It's got a great cast: Charles Hunnam from Sons of Anarchy, Jude Law, and Eric Bana.

And it has one of the writers of Edge of Tomorrow. </TEXT>

<TITLE> What is the one movie that made you a fan forever of an actor? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-22 19:51:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Saw the Sam Rockwell post and thought of the question.  I saw him in Moon and will always be interested in a movie he's in even if I don't end up watching it.

Same with Tom Cruise though he's had so many I can't really just pick one.

Pulp Fiction made me keep an eye out for Travolta though I'd already seen him in Look Who's Talking.

Will Smith is actually because of the Fresh Prince.  

Had liked Jim Carrey a lot in Truman Show but Eternal Sunshine made me a forever fan.

How about you?

<TEXT> saw it, absolutely loved it, it's out in theaters now, go check it out!

and heres my short review of it

I originally wanted to watch last year but it only played one week.  Now it's back in theaters and I just got back from a packed screen filled mostly with teens, couples and even a few over thirty, from all races.

The movie is about a girl and boy who switch places when a comet appears in the sky.  That's the story in a nutshell but it's so much more and I think that's why it was the number one movie in Japan last year and is second only to Spirited Away's box office.  It's also a coming of age story, a romance, about the culture of the countryside versus the city, the vanishing culture of parts of the country, and about the 3/10 tsunami.  The story is told with humor, without cynicism which is probably why the writer/director has been called the new Hayao Miyazaki although they are very different.  If one wants to understand Japan, this may be the best movie to convey where it is at this moment.  Both boy and girl roles are equally strong and developed so it's also a good date movie.  

It's really just a great movie period and I recommend it wholeheartedly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> who knew who chris hemsworth was before he was picked as thor? or daniel craig before bond?  white actors get plucked from obscurity for breakout roles but the same thing is not happening for minority actors and in gits' case, it's egregious because they could have since the role was asian to begin with but instead they invented a whole new backstory to justify her beng white that weakened the movie, thats how averse to asians being in the leading role they are

being ok with whitewashing is the same thing as being ok with rosa parks sitting in the back of the bus because that's how its been done or whatever reason they asspull </TEXT>

<TEXT> such narrow thinking.  not everyone wants to watch a film with a lead of their ethnicity especially when the original role is japanese and it's still set in Asia.  that undermines the story.  

and in this case they went the extra mile to justify their whitewashing with an entire subplot  

glad brave producers like blumhouse are there putting out movies like get out  </TEXT>

<TEXT> great point, I love anime and always expect the movie versions to suck and they usually do.  anime isnt like a video game or book, it is its own art on par with movies and adaptations misunderstand this and try to make it into a standard hollywood flick 

without showing an understanding of the separate art that is anime, the anime fan then cannot be depended upon to multiply support and so that leaves mainstream audiences who for various reasons already mentioned in this post stayed away. </TEXT>

when I said Rots stands up with the trilogy, I say it to support my statement that quality films have more than one thing going for it, if you object to Rots then pick any quality film with flaws in its place

<TEXT> this back and forth is what I mean.  okay, it's a weak scene.  he shouldnt have said his mom by name.  but there are 50 other scenes.  even masterpieces have flaws but we don't zero in on them because of the other things that go right.  perhaps films that are "ruined" by one scene aren't as strong as masterpieces but i've seen it said enough that its disproportionate to the number of actually ruined movies vs decent to good movies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> endings are the most precarious as I cited in my example of The Village, but usually those are the ones that rely on twist because so much is riding on the pay off for it.  I can't think of any non-twist ending that ruined my experience.  

Bad acting like Jar Jar nearly ruined Phantom Menace for me but I just blocked him out and the great thing about movies is there are dozens of other things to enjoy whether it's music or wardrobe or acting.  But the bad acting isn't going to be in every scene unless it's the lead of the movie who just can't act.

So I think we're agreeing though you go farther than I do.  I'd love to hear some examples of films from you  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Saw this article about the Darth Vader "No" scream ruining Revenge of the Sith but though it has its flaws, it stands up with the Original Trilogy in quality.

I used to think like that article did in my younger days.  When Trinity revived Neo in the first Matrix, I laughed and said it ruined the movie.  But that was ignoring everything else in the movie that worked and overcame it.

One way a scene can ruin a movie is by being so bad as to change the understanding 
of what we've seen.  The end of The Village comes to mind.

Or by being so awful at the start of the movie that it taints everything else that comes after it which usually happens with weak premises in movies like Speed 2 or any number of "why did they do that" reboots.

Plus, now that I've seen the Matrix a few times since over the years, I actually get that scene now.  So when we say x scene ruins a movie, we're also saying that it is and forever will be irredeemable which is a pretty strong statement that is thrown around too casually by critics and audiences.

Let's be better evaluators and that usually can't be done with a dismissive statement as "x scene ruined the movie." </TEXT>

<TEXT> im not sure which character had the better arc, im really not interested in "better."  but I think as a measure, luke offers a good one.  I think lukes arc is great but anakins is too with a few rough spots like the rushed romance.  but episode three is pure magic, how hes torn between both sith and jedi, and makes the choice for padme.  his transition to youngling murderer also happens a bit fast but it .makes sense when hes already killed tusken children, it's a war, he thinks he needs to save padme like he couldnt save his mom right now, and the jedi have ignored his troubled feelings etc.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> luke's acting was fine in eps five and six.  but he overdid the whiny teen too much in four.

yes, some of the dialogue esp romance was flawed but im giving luke a pass too

ani was a possessive angry teen

luke was a whiny bratty teen

they both grew up in later episodes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> people are blinded by the cinematography.  it does look nice and even tfa which I hate.  if prequels had similar cinematography maybe its flaws wouldve been overlooked too, but lucas I think made an aesthetic choice to make republics look clean and ideal as opposed to gritty and real with life under the empire </TEXT>

<TITLE> Rewatched Episode 3eeee because of you Sith Lords, here is my holo recording </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-18 15:07:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For my holo recording of [Episode One](https://www.reddit.com/r/PrequelMemes/comments/5zri8v/thanks_to_you_sith_lords_im_rewatching_the/)

Episode 3eeeeeee

the opening shot following obi wan and anakin's two fighters then revealing the epic scale of the battle is jaw dropping.  coruscant is an awesome backdrop in the shots 

I know lucas actually used a combo of cg and models but whatever he did with this opening battle it looks amazing 

cool, anakin no longer looks like a teenbop coverboy 

obi wan and anakin trying to get past the vulture droids, lucas indisputably knows how to direct spacefight scenes

oddball is the call sign of a clone, I wonder if he was in the animated clone wars?  I saw it a while back but cant remember 

when anakin compliments r2, he really seems more comfortable in his own skin and matured

buzz droids attacking! love the variety and depth of the world

obi wan in trouble, says hes running out of tricks but he hasnt tried spinning smh

anakin saves obi wan's life only to try to kill him at the end, tragic 

nice little touch with r2 taking out buzz droid

I am just really starting to realize that they were fighting above coruscant, dooku was very close to winning if it werent for obi wan and anakin, tragic!

the nemoidian talking to grievous doesnt have a bad asian accent like in episode one, also I recall the one in episode two didnt have it either, you cant say lucas didnt try to improve 

obi wan and anakin take out an elevator full of droids, anakin seems like his powers have indeed doubled 

anakin and obi wans bickering seems also to have matured, they really are more like brothers now

lol at the rivalry between obi wan and anakin about r2 and implicitly r4

three way fight with dooku begins, much has been said about spinning and jumping shit, but there is real weight and tension in each attack here

lol the extra reason for anakin not to kill dooku came after he killed him, so hes needing less reason to kill.  nice to see hes still conflicted though.  I wonder if Palpatine somehow gave anakin the edge over dooku

I thought anakins outfit was black but now I think it might be more of a dark brown, if so, a nice progression from light to semi dark to dark

classic side of ship to side of ship firing, but in space

I cant help but wonder what dooku's republic wouldve looked like, he knew the corruption in the senate and jedi council to an extent but also fought as a sith

grievous looks amazing

"youre a lot shorter than I expected," "jedi scum", the humor without jar jar is just the right tone 

love how the good guys keep getting captured

those roman sentry droids look cool

anakin trying to land says "extend all flaps and drag fins", lucas' love of flying is showing 

sheev looks actually worried hes going to die lol

the problem qui gon had reacting to the green screen during the fish attack in episode one doesnt look like a problem anymore during the landing with anakin and obi 

great shot of ani and obi getting close to camera as they land

coruscant still looks amazing

its shameful how manipulated the jedi council was by sheev

sam jackson needs to say motherfucker once and id be complete

padme rocking the buns, so much hotter than leia

hes eventually happy but i wonder why ani hesitates when padme says shes pregnant

coruscant at night is blade runnerish

love john williams music from start to finish in all the movies

dayum, hayden without his shirt, has filled out nicely

padme's apartment seems to have the best view of all of coruscant 

ani is revealing his premonition to padme and hayden is acting circles around natalie

seeing the jedi temple reminded me of a thought from episode 2, the youngling who gives the answer to where kamino is looks like the same youngling anakin kills at the end 

aang from avatar goes through same dilemma as ani when theyre told to let go of love, here it's clearly an either or situation, I forget how avatar resolved it but he did end up happily with katara and his powers didnt suffer

palpatine gets granted more emergency powers to fight the war, reminds me of bush

obi warns ani to beware palpatine and in next scene, palpatine says trust me, he mustve sensed ani's doubt 

sheev putting anakin on the council is a masterful move and so is the council asking ani to be a double agent, poor ani, much tragedy

ani takes the request and everything personally, obi reminds him it's not him asking, I seem to remember maybe in the clone war series there was an answer to this dilemma of balancing love and the force

"have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?"  "what do you mean?"  "what if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists.  and the republics has become the very evil we've been fighting to destroy?"  "I dont believe that and youre sounding like a separatist." "this war represents a failure to listen."  - this conversation could be had now and im not sure which side id take

lol now padme is asking anakin to talk to sheev.  anakin is torn on not just two but three sides and from the one he loves most.  padme told ani before that democracy is hard when both sides think theyre right.  ani is living it now

wtf is the show at the concert hall sheev is watching?

sheev makes a good point about the council being hypocritical by asking ani to spy on him, but I guess only if you take too idealistic of a reading of the jedi code is it unforgivable

"all who gain power are afraid to lose it, even the jedi."  "the jedi use their power for good."  "good is a point of view."  mic drop

sheev hits a wall with ani in his case that jedi and sith are similar, ani still believes jedi are selfless, so sheev brings up the story of darth plagueis, using ani's fear to bring him closer to him

anyone know in the canon if sheev can create life like plagueis?

kashyyyk looks amazing and camouflaged stormtroopers!

ani's being sweet apologizing to obi for his arrogance, and obi is very generous with his praise of anakin, it's nice to see anakin's at times still a good guy

nice to see clones show personality in banter with obi as on the clone wars show

lucas gets knocked for his dialogue but padme promising ani she wont die in childbirth and ani responding with "no, I promise you" is perfect 

utapau looks part amazing, part too much cg like geonosis

windu says if they destroy sheev, theyll have to take control of the govt to ensure a peaceful transition, yoda says "to a dark place this line of thought takes us," which raises an interesting dilemma, do the jedi have to become more like the sith to defeat them?

coruscant looks beautiful at sunset 

sheev took out three jedi masters in three seconds, wouldve liked to see a longer fight.  ah well, I got to hear the magic lines at least

sheev's snarl was pretty autistic

ani comes to see mace about to arrest sheev.  sheev tries a sneak attack but mace defends.  both say each other is the traitor.  mace says the oppression of the sith will never return.  sheev says only he has the power to save padme.  the fate of the galaxy and your loved one is at stake.  what would you do?

I wonder if sheev's skin was always that fucked 

sheev masterfully playing possum to make ani come to his aid because thats the one thing ani will do, save people he cares for

mace now wants to kill sheev.  ani says he cant.  but mace says sheev has control of the senate and the courts.  ani has been taught that the jedi are righteous and tries to talk mace out of it.  but in the end, it comes down to ani wanting to save padme and he kills mace.  I guess he was hoping to learn from sheev when he was in prison. 

the actor playing sheev is brilliant.  I think he just had an orgasm after killing mace

but maybe mace is alive.  we saw ani and obi flying through the air in episode two

ani's "what have I done" is truly heartbreaking.  he wanted both padme and the jedi way and both mace and sheev betrayed him, but only one way will help him save padme so the choices seem limited 

ani's dialogue about pledging himself is rushed, but hayden does a great job of selling it 

sheev knows he still has to convince ani to do his bidding, makes a seductive argument about having to eliminate to jedi to prevent a civil war 

the killing of the tusken raiders' children was a nice setup for the killing of the younglings at the temple 

sheev says once more the sith will rule the galaxy and theyll have peace, and come to think of it, was life in the empire really that bad?  we shouldve seen more of it in the ot

order 66 music is awesome

padme is a bit too helpless with anakin, though I guess powerful women can be like that around the ones they love 

now anakin's lied about what he did at the temple, his descent into darkness is extending to their relationship

obi and organa walking through...it's the recreated corridor set from new hope!

mustafar looks amazing

seems a lot longer but the time of events between pt and ot is only two decades

did yoda just bat a laser blast back like a baseball?

sheev using jedi "rebellion" to gain more power.  reminds me of trump and his wiretapping and biased media claims.  also reminds me of what padme said, "democracy dies when people stop believing it works"

senate applauding sheev's proclamation that republic will be replaced with an empire, it must be sheev's senators 

obi and yoda recalibrated code to warn jedi to stay away from the temple, I guess empire hunted them down before the ot

obi really believed in ani, shouldve known it was ani who killed younglings but still had to check security holograms

security hologram of sheev and ani, were the jedi bugging sheev?

cg yoda looks great

obi tells padme the full truth, what a stand up guy, couldve done the same for luke ha!

obi goes to padme to find out where ani's gone, so he knew they were lovers but hadnt said anything

obi now stowing away on padme's ship, hes becoming more like qui gon, using deceit when needed, maybe qui gon (and mace, not like the jedi hadnt killed before) was on to something, not being so rigid in dogma as the jedi had become 

the viceroy is trying to tell ani the truth, that hes been working with sheev, but ani is too far gone and kills him

I love padme taking a moment before confronting ani, it's a nice moment alone with her

portman runs to ani, not really something a pregnant woman would do

lol ani smirks big time when padme says obi wants to help them, he really thinks hes all powerful and doesnt need any help

padme says let's run away and ani gives his "I am the one who knocks" speech

wow ani was going to overthrow sheev and I think he couldve but then he got fucked up by obi

ani and padme are acting great here 

I love ani circling obi before their duel like a dance

"only a sith deals in absolutes", I dont agree with that exactly.  both sith and jedi have shown to be open and closed but maybe the problem is they dont listen to each other as ani's mom had said

ot's lightsaber fighting is a lot more basic, though theres some high jumps.  I wonder if it isnt also because the jedi and vader had lost their skills by then

ha its the blue business guy that was said to be buying off the senators from episode one now standing with sheev

I dont think yoda shouldve gotten hit by sheev's lightning, he had blocked dooku's in episode two easily

ani and obi fighting in the hallway, lights going off and on for a strobe effect, every movie lucas does this it works

ani just jump kicked obi like obi jump kicked jango, lol still weird when they do this 

yoda and sheev fighting on senate floor, this is perfect

dual force pushes by ani and obi, yes!

uh oh, ani just hit the computer, love how elaborate the action set pieces are

yoda repels sheev's blast and sends them both falling but only yoda falls, it's almost as if it was fate that decided which would win

I still think yoda shouldve beaten sheev but I guess then thered be no ot

it bugs me during the heavy cg scenes when they at least dont use real foreground material

volcano going off around them looks epic

I remember yoda doing a bruce lee like wipe of his nose either vs dooku or sheev but I havent seen it on the blu ray, wonder if they changed this along with puppet yoda

cool to see organa getting screen time

obi ani fight is crazy, theyre trying to kill each other while on a floating antenna on a river of lava 

obi makes a good point when he says ani is lost, though the jedi are far from perfect, theres a clear distinction between them and the sith

obi looks like hes holding in a smile after he cuts off ani's legs

ani rocking those darth maul eyes 

obi not saving ani, he knows ani is still dangerous, nice that they didnt make it so he was cold hearted

obi comes back to the ship, c3po freaking out, obi gives him a comforting tap on the shoulder when hes the one who just nearly killed his friend and brother, what a good dude

sheev actually touches ani and looks like hes giving him comfort, well he is a master manipulator and politician and wants ani to live as his apprentice, contrast that with obi's reason for his comforting touch to c3 and padme

asteroid they're hiding on looks amazing 

nice parallel with padme giving birth while ani undergoing his operation, padme dies while vader and the twins are born

obi didnt tell padme what he did to ani before she lost her will to live so perhaps she sensed it through the force somehow

oohbah oohbah...

the scars on ani are pretty gnarly

til the end, padme believed in ani and said to obi there was good in him, I wonder how much that affected how he dealt with Luke in new hope

sheev tells ani he killed padme in his anger, ani says she couldve have, he felt she was alive, but what choice does he have but to believe the emperor at this point?  still, his "no" comes too fast and is still cringeworthy

room where organa, obi and yoda convene looks like from an 80s video game but hey it's a real set

yoda tells obi he will teach him how to commune with qui gon, that hes mastered immortality, pretty awesome that qui gon mastered immortality first, the true way, unlike sheev's way, and it makes sense qui gon was the one, he went against the council by vouching for ani and showed he was more one with the force than yoda

naboo at night at padme's funeral procession looks appropriately haunting

aw, padme is holding ani's pendant he gave her in episode one, much tragic

darth, vader, and cg tarkin? on destroyer looking at death star.  still think r1 went too far by bringing him back to life and actually acting, thats very sithlike

back on tatooine, luke meets beru and owen, beautiful call back shot of the two suns from new hope ends the movie, perfect ending

<TITLE> Been a long time since I saw Stsr Wars Episode One, rewatched it and here are my thoughts, both good and bad </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-18 15:02:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> so far a lot more sets than expected, the Neimodian ships are sets with green screen for the windows equivalent to the matte paintings in the ot

blu ray looks great.  much less sterile, more definition than dvds.  but definitely the dark or dirty scifi aesthetic is not what theyre going for here which kinda makes sense as films go from light to dark

Neimodians' racial casting is awful

every line is memeable, must resist the urge to type them all down

god, liam neeson must be half a foot taller than McGregor.  already the tone is set, jokier and lighter based on their dialogue than the ot though I remember ot had quite a few jokes with r2 and c3po to start 

whoa, qui gon and obi wan escaped the droidekas using superspeed

Fuck, it's jar jar.  him saying "my" instead of "i" has me asking "why."  gungans are supposed to be creole I guess, racial casting is truly horrible.  I get hes supposed to be comic relief but he is a no buts about it disaster

gungan city is beautiful.  

the vfx holds up very well ie the droids 

the green screen is showing when they leave gungan city and are attacked by the giant fish, qui gon hardly reacts

naboo scenes clearly all shot on location (also remember this was said on commentary)

natalie portman is too wooden, I guess shes supposed to be a queen but she probably shouldve really britished it up

damn, ani and padme just met, hes way too young for her, creepy how they vet together.  still, cute and innocent enough meeting

jake lloyd is great, he really nails the character, innocent but flashes of anger

he just said "yippee".  yep, still awful

tattoine scenes also clearly shot on location.  watto's shop is a set

watto cg holds up well

interesting that the tatooine scenes revolve around junk as in new hope

the market stall owner looks like hes in a costume/make up instead of cg

lucas seems to love open market scenes as in indiana jones 

every scene jar jars in, im just looking the other way.  seeing a lot of interesting stuff in the frame id never seen before, little details of acting, props 

I forgot darth maul could talk.  and apparently hes british

anakins mom has an accent, maybe Greek?

qui gon's out-negotiating watto for the podrace, impressive 

a lot of jar jars bits can be cut and wouldn't affect the story -other than making it better.  so george if you can hear me how about a special edition of phantom menace 

qui gons lied quite a bit, to ani about freeing slaves and about why he was taking his blood, to watto at their first negotiation 

at the hangar before the podrace, nice to notice many of the aliens in the background arent cg

the hanger is also an extended set 

ani's friend just said "this is so wizard".  too bad that never caught on

and theres the tusken raiders, they actually helped ani win by taking out some of his competition

podrace scene is exciting as I remember 

the heck, is that willow next to watto during the race?

padme just tucked ani in with a blanket, creepy

coruscant looks amazing 

"there is no civility, only politics.  the republic is not what it once was.  the senate is full of greedy, squabbling delegates.  there is no interest in the common good.  the chancellor has little real power.  he is mired by baseless accusations of corruption.  the bureaucrats are in charge now.  our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger supreme chancellor.  one who could control the bureaucrats and give us justice." - parallel with current state of american politics is timely 

I didnt understand anything about politics when I first watched it but whoa, palpatine was a senator from naboo.  padme is partly responsible for palpatine's rise

"enter the bureaucrat.  the true rulers of the republic.  and on the payroll of the trade federation I might add".  lucas studied his roman history

Palpatine says tragedy twice in the senate scene.  I wonder why he loves that word.

qui gon went against the jedi council despite obi wan's warning and said he still has much to learn.  did qui gon know how ineffective the council had become?

they dwell quite a bit on anakin's fear of losing his mother.  very nice foreshadowing.

Palpatine's manipulation to become chancellor is brilliant.  he schemes with the trade federation to blockade naboo, manipulated padme to ask for a no confidence vote against then chancellor valorum, knowing naboo's blockade would give them the sympathy vote 

lol obi wan warns qui gon about anakin being dangerous to take on as a padawan learner and qui gon says "from your point of view."

r/getmotivated quote from qui gon to ani, "your focus determines your reality."

yes, the duel of fates!

qui gon and darth maul's deaths are effective, good job 

yoda's cg holds up well 

love the celebration scenes at the end

okay that's it.  final thoughts: love the depth and originality of the story, some flaws but blocked out jar jar and enjoyed it, memorable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> part 2 of my commentary on episode 3

wtf is the show at the concert hall sheev is watching?

sheev makes a good point about the council being hypocritical by asking ani to spy on him, but I guess only if you take too idealistic of a reading of the jedi code is it unforgivable

"all who gain power are afraid to lose it, even the jedi."  "the jedi use their power for good."  "good is a point of view."  mic drop

sheev hits a wall with ani in his case that jedi and sith are similar, ani still believes jedi are selfless, so sheev brings up the story of darth plagueis, using ani's fear to bring him closer to him

anyone know in the canon if sheev can create life like plagueis?

kashyyyk looks amazing and camouflaged stormtroopers!

ani's being sweet apologizing to obi for his arrogance, and obi is very generous with his praise of anakin, it's nice to see anakin's at times still a good guy

nice to see clones show personality in banter with obi as on the clone wars show

lucas gets knocked for his dialogue but padme promising ani she wont die in childbirth and ani responding with "no, I promise you" is perfect 

utapau looks part amazing, part too much cg like geonosis

windu says if they destroy sheev, theyll have to take control of the govt to ensure a peaceful transition, yoda says "to a dark place this line of thought takes us," which raises an interesting dilemma, do the jedi have to become more like the sith to defeat them?

coruscant looks beautiful at sunset 

sheev took out three jedi masters in three seconds, wouldve liked to see a longer fight.  ah well, I got to hear the magic lines at least

sheev's snarl was pretty autistic

ani comes to see mace about to arrest sheev.  sheev tries a sneak attack but mace defends.  both say each other is the traitor.  mace says the oppression of the sith will never return.  sheev says only he has the power to save padme.  the fate of the galaxy and your loved one is at stake.  what would you do?

I wonder if sheev's skin was always that fucked 

sheev masterfully playing possum to make ani come to his aid because thats the one thing ani will do, save people he cares for

mace now wants to kill sheev.  ani says he cant.  but mace says sheev has control of the senate and the courts.  ani has been taught that the jedi are righteous and tries to talk mace out of it.  but in the end, it comes down to ani wanting to save padme and he kills mace.  I guess he was hoping to learn from sheev when he was in prison. 

the actor playing sheev is brilliant.  I think he just had an orgasm after killing mace

but maybe mace is alive.  we saw ani and obi flying through the air in episode two

ani's "what have I done" is truly heartbreaking.  he wanted both padme and the jedi way and both mace and sheev betrayed him, but only one way will help him save padme so the choices seem limited 

ani's dialogue about pledging himself is rushed, but hayden does a great job of selling it 

sheev knows he still has to convince ani to do his bidding, makes a seductive argument about having to eliminate to jedi to prevent a civil war 

the killing of the tusken raiders' children was a nice setup for the killing of the younglings at the temple 

sheev says once more the sith will rule the galaxy and theyll have peace, and come to think of it, was life in the empire really that bad?  we shouldve seen more of it in the ot

order 66 music is awesome

padme is a bit too helpless with anakin, though I guess powerful women can be like that around the ones they love 

now anakin's lied about what he did at the temple, his descent into darkness is extending to their relationship

obi and organa walking through...it's the recreated corridor set from new hope!

mustafar looks amazing

seems a lot longer but the time of events between pt and ot is only two decades

did yoda just bat a laser blast back like a baseball?

sheev using jedi "rebellion" to gain more power.  reminds me of trump and his wiretapping and biased media claims.  also reminds me of what padme said, "democracy dies when people stop believing it works"

senate applauding sheev's proclamation that republic will be replaced with an empire, it must be sheev's senators 

obi and yoda recalibrated code to warn jedi to stay away from the temple, I guess empire hunted them down before the ot

obi really believed in ani, shouldve known it was ani who killed younglings but still had to check security holograms

security hologram of sheev and ani, were the jedi bugging sheev?

cg yoda looks great

obi tells padme the full truth, what a stand up guy, couldve done the same for luke ha!

obi goes to padme to find out where ani's gone, so he knew they were lovers but hadnt said anything

obi now stowing away on padme's ship, hes becoming more like qui gon, using deceit when needed, maybe qui gon (and mace, not like the jedi hadnt killed before) was on to something, not being so rigid in dogma as the jedi had become 

the viceroy is trying to tell ani the truth, that hes been working with sheev,  ut ani is too far gone and kills him

I love padme taking a moment before confronting ani, it's a nice moment alone with her

portman runs to ani, not really something a pregnant woman would do

lol ani smirks big time when padme says obi wants to help them, he really thinks hes all powerful and doesnt need any help

padme says let's run away and ani gives his "I am the one who knocks" speech

wow ani was going to overthrow sheev and I think he couldve but then he got fucked up by obi

ani and padme are acting great here 

I love ani circling obi before their duel like a dance

"only a sith deals in absolutes", I dont agree with that exactly.  both sith and jedihave shown to open and closed but maybe the problem is they dont listen to each other as ani's mom had said

ot's lightsaber fighting is a lot more basic, though theres some high jumps.  I wonder if it isnt also because the jedi and vader had lost their skills by then

ha its the blue business guy that was said to be buying off the senators from episode one now standing with sheev

I dont think yoda shouldve gotten hit by sheev's lightning, he had blocked dooku's in episode two easily

ani and obi fighting in the hallway, lights going off and on for a strobe effect, every movie lucas does this it works

ani just jump kicked obi like obi jump kicked jango, lol still weird when they do this 

yoda and sheev fighting on senate floor, this is perfect

dual force pushes by ani and obi, yes!

uh oh, ani just hit the computer, love how elaborate the action set pieces are

yoda repels sheev's blast and sends them both falling but only yoda falls, it's almost as if it was fate that decided which would win

I still think yoda shouldve beaten sheev but I guess then thered be no ot

it bugs me during the heavy cg scenes when they at least dont use real foreground material

volcano going off around them looks epic

I remember yoda doing a bruce lee like wipe of his nose either vs dooku or sheev but I havent seen it on the blu ray, wonder ifnthry changed this along with puppet yoda

cool to see organa getting screen time

obi ani fight is crazy, theyre trying to kill each other while on a floating antenna on a river of lava 

obi makes a good point when he says ani is lost, though the jedi are far from perfect, theres a clear distinction between them and the sith

obi looks like hes holding in a smile after he cuts off ani's legs

ani rocking those darth maul eyes 

obi not saving ani, he knows ani is still dangerous, nice that they didnt make it so he was cold hearted

obi comes back to the ship, c3po freaking out, obi gives him a comforting tap on the shoulder when hes the one who just nearly killed his friend and brother, what a good dude

sheev actually touches ani and looks like hes govin him comfort, well he is a master manipulator and politician and wants ani to live as his apprentice, contrast that with obi's comforting touch to c3 and padme

asteroid they're hiding on looks amazing 

nice parallel with padme giving birth while ani undergoing his operation, padme dies while vader and the twins are born

obi didnt tell padme what he did to ani before she lost her will to live so perhaps she sensed it through the force somehow

oohbah oohbah...

the scars on ani are pretty gnarly

til the end, padme believed in ani and said to obi there was good in him, I wonder how much that affected how he dealt with Luke in new hope

sheev tells ani he killed padme in his anger, ani says she couldve have, he felt she was alive, but what choice does he have but to believe the emperor at this point?  still, his "no" comes too fast and is still cringeworthy

room where organa, obi and yoda convene looks like from an 80s video game but hey it's a real set

yoda tells obi he will teach him how to commune with qui gon, that hees masterpiece d immort, pretty awesome that qui gon mastered immortality first, the true way, unlike sheev's way, and it makes sense qui gon was the one, he went against the council by vouching for ani and showed he was more one with the force than yoda

naboo at night at padme's funeral procession looks appropriately haunting

aw, padme is holding ani's pendant he gave her in episode one, much tragic

darth, vader, and cg tarkin? on destroyer looking at death star.  still think r1 went too far by bringing him back to life and actually acting, thats very sithlike

back on tatooine, luke meets beru and owen, beautiful call back shot of the two suns from new hope ends the movie, perfect ending

<TEXT> because of you Sith Lords, I decided to complete my running commentary for episode three

the opening shot following obi wan and anakin's two fighters then revealing the epic scale of the battle is jaw dropping.  coruscant is an awesome backdrop in the shots 

I know lucas actually used a combo of cg and models but whatever he did with this opening battle it looks amazing 

cool, anakin no longer looks like a teenbop coverboy 

obi wan and anakin trying to get past the vulture droids, lucas indisputably knows how to direct spacefight scenes

oddball is the call sign of a clone, I wonder if he was in the animated clone wars?  I saw it a while back but cant remember 

when anakin compliments r2, he really seems more comfortable in his own skin and matured

buzz droids attacking! love the variety and depth of the world

obi wan in trouble, says hes running out of tricks but he hasnt tried spinning smh

anakin saves obi wan's life only to try to kill him at the end, tragic 

nice little touch with r2 taking out buzz droid

I am just really starting to realize that they were fighting above coruscant, dooku was very close to winning if it werent for obi wan and anakin, tragic!

the nemoidian talking to grievous doesnt have a bad asian accent like in episode one, also I recall the one in episode two didnt have it either, you cant say lucas didnt try to improve 

obi wan and anakin take out an elevator full of droids, anakin seems like his powers have indeed doubled 

anakin and obi wans bickering seems also to have matured, they really are more like brothers now

lol at the rivalry between obi wan and anakin about r2 and implicitly r4

three way fight with dooku begins, much has been said about spinning and jumping shit, but there is real weight and tension in each attack here

they did a good job replacing dooku's head with cg

lol the extra reason for anakin not to kill dooku came after he killed him, so hes needing less reason to kill.  nice to see hes still conflicted though.  I wonder if Palpatine somehow gave anakin the edge over dooku

I thought anakins outfit was black but now I think it might be more of a dark brown, if so, a nice progression from light to dark

classic side of ship to side of ship firing, but in space

I cant help but wonder what dooku's republic wouldve looked like, he knew the corruption in the senate and jedi council to an extent but also fought as a sith

grievous looks amazing

"youre a lot shorter than I expected," "jedi scum", the humor without jar jar is just the right tone 

love how the good guys keep getting captured

those roman sentry droids look cool

anakin trying to land says "extend all flaps and drag fins", lucas' love of flying is showing 

sheev looks actually worried hes going to die lol

the problem qui gon had reacting to the green screen during the fish attack in episode one doesnt look like a problem anymore during the landing with anakin and obi 

great shot of ani and obi getting close to camera as they land

coruscant still looks amazing

its shameful how manipulated the jedi council was by sheev

sam jackson needs to say motherfucker once and id be complete

padme rocking the buns, so much hotter than leia

hes eventually happy but i wonder why ani hesitates when padme says shes pregnant

coruscant at night is blade runnerish

love john williams music from start to finish of all the movies

dayum, hayden without his shirt, has filled out nicely

padme's apartment seems to have the best view of all of coruscant 

ani is revealing his premonition to padme and hayden is acting circles around natalie

seeing the jedi temple reminded me of a thought from episode 2, the youngling who gives the answer to where kamino is looks like the same youngling anakin kills at the end 

aang from avatar goes through same dilemma as ani when theyre told to let go of love, here it's clearly an either or situation, I forget how avatar resolved it but he did end up happily with katara and his powers didnt suffer

palpatine gets granted more emergency powers to fight the war, reminds me of bush

obi warns ani to beware palpatine and in next scene, palpatine says trust me, he mustve sensed ani's doubt 

sheev putting anakin on the council is a masterful move and so is the council asking ani to be a double agent, poor ani, much tragedy

ani takes the request and everything personally, obi reminds him it's not him asking, I seem to remember maybe in the clone war series there was an answer to this dilemma of balancing love and the force

"have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?"  "what do you mean?"  "what if the democrqcy we thought we were serving no longer exists.  and the republics c has become the very evil we've been fighting to destroy?"  "I dont believe that and youre sounding like a separatist." "this war represents a failure to listen."  - this conversation could be had now and im not sure which side id take

lol now padme is asking anakin to talk to sheev.  anakin is torn on not just two but three sides and from the one he loves most.  padme told ani before that democracy is hard when both sides think theyre right.  ani is living it now </TEXT>

<TEXT> great write up.  it's fascinating to get someone's thoughts as they happen.  a couple things I differ on is that I thought there was too much green screen at genosis,  it was the first time in the series for me that it became distracting.  even most of the sand was cg.  

also, I think the romance couldve been less cringey if they bonded at the start but anakin was pretty creepy the whole time.  I think padme shouldve had a bigger reaction after anakin's admission he killed the tusken women and children, but perhaps shes just a really out of touch queen and had no thought about the tusken other than what shed been told that they were animals.  but overall I think they did a good job with the romance and you gave a great read on their characters.  theyre both flawed people who cling to the past, one in a good way the other in a bad, so what happened seems like it was the only logical conclusion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> hello there, darth u/hideous!  I too have just begun a prequel marathon but since I have no gif ability, I wanted to share my play by play of episode one 

so far a lot more sets than expected, the Neimodian ships are sets with green screen for the windows equivalent to the matte paintings in the ot

blu ray looks great.  much less sterile, more definition than dvds.  but definitely the dark or dirty scifi aesthetic is not what theyre going for here which kinda makes sense as films go from light to dark

Neimodians' racial casting is awful

every line is memeable, must resist the urge to type them all down

god, liam neeson must be half a foot taller than McGregor.  already the tone is set, jokier and lighter based on their dialogue than the ot though I remember ot had quite a few jokes with r2 and c3po to start 

whoa, qui gon and obi wan escaped the droidekas using superspeed

Fuck, it's jar jar.  him saying "my" instead of "i" has me asking "why."  gungans are supposed to be creole I guess, racial casting is truly horrible.  I get hes supposed to be comic relief but he is a no buts about it disaster

gungan city is beautiful.  

the vfx holds up very well ie the droids 

the green screen is showing when they leave gungan city and are attacked by the giant fish, qui gon hardly reacts

naboo scenes clearly all shot on location (also remember this was said on commentary)

natalie portman is too wooden, I guess shes supposed to be a queen but she probably shouldve really britished it up

damn, ani and padme just met, hes way too young for her, creepy how they vet together.  still, cute and innocent enough meeting

jake lloyd is great, he really nails the character, innocent but flashes of anger

he just said "yippee".  yep, still awful

tattoine scenes also clearly shot on location.  watto's shop is a set

watto cg holds up well

interesting that the tatooine scenes revolve around junk as in new hope

the market stall owner looks like hes in a costume/make up instead of cg

lucas seems to love open market scenes as in indiana jones 

every scene jar jars in, im just looking the other way.  seeing a lot of interesting stuff in the frame id never seen before, little details of acting, props 

I forgot darth maul could talk.  and apparently hes british

anakins mom has an accent, maybe Greek?

qui gon's out-negotiating watto for the podrace, impressive 

a lot of jar jars bits can be cut and wouldn't affect the story -other than making it better.  so george if you can hear me how about a special edition of phantom menace 

qui gons lied quite a bit, to ani about freeing slaves and about why he was taking his blood, to watto at their first negotiation 

at the hangar before the podrace, nice to notice many of the aliens in the background arent cg

the hanger is also an extended set 

ani's friend just said "this is so wizard".  too bad that never caught on

and theres the tusken raiders, they actually helped ani win by taking out some of his competition

podrace scene is exciting as I remember 

the heck, is that willow next to watto during the race?

padme just tucked ani in with a blanket, creepy

coruscant looks amazing 

"there is no civility, only politics.  the republic is not what it once was.  the senate is full of greedy, squabbling delegates.  there is no interest in the common good.  the chancellor has little real power.  he is mired by baseless accusations of corruption.  the bureaucrats are in charge now.  our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger supreme chancellor.  one who could control the bureaucrats and give us justice." - parallel with current state of american politics is timely 

I didnt understand anything about politics when I first watched it but whoa, palpatine was a senator from naboo.  padme is partly responsible for palpatine's rise

"enter the bureaucrat.  the true rulers of the republic.  and on the payroll of the trade federation I might add".  lucas studied his roman history

Palpatine says tragedy twice in the senate scene.  I wonder why he loves that word.

qui gon went against the jedi council despite obi wan's warning and said he still has much to learn.  did qui gon know how ineffective the council had become?

they dwell quite a bit on anakin's fear of losing his mother.  very nice foreshadowing.

Palpatine's manipulation to become chancellor is brilliant.  he schemes with the trade federation to blockade naboo, manipulated padme to ask for a no confidence vote against then chancellor valorum, knowing naboo's blockade would give them the sympathy vote 

lol obi wan warns qui gon about anakin being dangerous to take on as a padawan learner and qui gon says "from your point of view."

r/getmotivated quote from qui gon to ani, "your focus determines your reality."

yes, the duel of fates!

qui gon and darth maul's deaths are effective, good job 

yoda's cg holds up well 

love the celebration scenes at the end

okay that's it.  final thoughts: love the depth and originality of the story, some flaws but blocked out jar jar and enjoyed it, memorable. </TEXT>

so far a lot more sets than expected, the Neimodian ships are sets with green screen for the windows equivalent to the matte paintings in the ot

blu ray looks great.  much less sterile, more definition than dvds.  but definitely the dark or dirty scifi aesthetic is not what theyre going for here which kinda makes sense as films go from light to dark

Neimodians' racial casting is awful

every line is memeable, must resist the urge to type them all down

god, liam neeson must be half a foot taller than McGregor.  already the tone is set, jokier and lighter based on their dialogue than the ot though I remember ot had quite a few jokes with r2 and c3po to start 

whoa, qui gon and obi wan escaped the droidekas using superspeed

Fuck, it's jar jar.  him saying "my" instead of "i" has me asking "why."  gungans are supposed to be creole I guess, racial casting is truly horrible.  I get hes supposed to be comic relief but he is a no buts about it disaster

gungan city is beautiful.  

the vfx holds up very well ie the droids 

the green screen is showing when they leave gungan city and are attacked by the giant fish, qui gon hardly reacts

naboo scenes clearly all shot on location (also remember this was said on commentary)

natalie portman is too wooden, I guess shes supposed to be a queen but she probably shouldve really britished it up

damn, ani and padme just met, hes way too young for her, creepy how they vet together.  still, cute and innocent enough meeting

jake lloyd is great, he really nails the character, innocent but flashes of anger

he just said "yippee".  yep, still awful

tattoine scenes also clearly shot on location.  watto's shop is a set

watto cg holds up well

interesting that the tatooine scenes revolve around junk as in new hope

the market stall owner looks like hes in a costume/make up instead of cg

lucas seems to love open market scenes as in indiana jones 

every scene jar jars in, im just looking the other way.  seeing a lot of interesting stuff in the frame id never seen before, little details of acting, props 

I forgot darth maul could talk.  and apparently hes british

anakins mom has an accent, maybe Greek?

qui gon's out-negotiating watto for the podrace, impressive 

a lot of jar jars bits can be cut and wouldn't affect the story -other than making it better.  so george if you can hear me how about a special edition of phantom menace 

qui gons lied quite a bit, to ani about freeing slaves and about why he was taking his blood, to watto at their first negotiation 

at the hangar before the podrace, nice to notice many of the aliens in the background arent cg

the hanger is also an extended set 

ani's friend just said "this is so wizard".  too bad that never caught on

and theres the tusken raiders, they actually helped ani win by taking out some of his competition

podrace scene is exciting as I remember 

the heck, is that willow next to watto during the race?

padme just tucked ani in with a blanket, creepy

coruscant looks amazing 

"there is no civility, only politics.  the republic is not what it once was.  the senate is full of greedy, squabbling delegates.  there is no interest in the common good.  the chancellor has little real power.  he is mired by baseless accusations of corruption.  the bureaucrats are in charge now.  our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger supreme chancellor.  one who could control the bureaucrats and give us justice." - parallel with current state of american politics is timely 

I didnt understand anything about politics when I first watched it but whoa, palpatine was a senator from naboo.  padme is partly responsible for palpatine's rise

"enter the bureaucrat.  the true rulers of the republic.  and on the payroll of the trade federation I might add".  lucas studied his roman history

Palpatine says tragedy twice in the senate scene.  I wonder why he loves that word.

qui gon went against the jedi council despite obi wan's warning and said he still has much to learn.  did qui gon know how ineffective the council had become?

they dwell quite a bit on anakin's fear of losing his mother.  very nice foreshadowing.

Palpatine's manipulation to become chancellor is brilliant.  he schemes with the trade federation to blockade naboo, manipulated padme to ask for a no confidence vote against then chancellor valorum, knowing naboo's blockade would give them the sympathy vote 

lol obi wan warns qui gon about anakin being dangerous to take on as a padawan learner and qui gon says "from your point of view."

r/getmotivated quote from qui gon to ani, "your focus determines your reality."

yes, the duel of fates!

qui gon and darth maul's deaths are effective, good job 

yoda's cg holds up well 

love the celebration scenes at the end

okay that's it.  final thoughts: love the depth and originality of the story, some flaws but blocked out jar jar and enjoyed it, memorable. </TEXT>

youre not speaking to the motivation though, youre talking about the process, if he was going for the look of a futuristic and ideal republic, I think he achieved it.  whether or not it works is subjective.

ok so now youre talking about use of space and green screen making it feel empty/artificial (ill add in cinematography), but if youre an artist and you want to make it a point the republic is corrupt/empty, it makes sense to try to be sterile.  I still would've preferred it more "natural" though.  I think many of its flaws couldve been overlooked if it looked a little cooler -ot had flaws aplenty - despite the artistic motivation argument.  but you know I think he was trying to push the envelope as he had done with ot and I dont fault him too hard for that.  

yes, I was trying to say ilm's work led to yoda and Gollum but explained it poorly

<TEXT> be george lucas

make star fucking wars

spearhead creation of indiana jones franchise 

create ilm thats done cgi for every big tentpole like jurassic park

inspired james fucking cameron to get into movies

give fans up close look of how star wars was made because you want to share, knowledge they will later use against you because they have no fucking clue how collaborative movie and tv industry is

decide to fix a few things always wrong with ot, most good which goes unnoticed, some you prob should have left alone, but hey those fans will still have the originals 

but at this point no one says no because youre george fucking lucas 

decide to finally give fans what they want and creates the prequels

no one says no when you decide to push boundaries of film again and film mostly with green screen (though no one remembers you still used a shit ton of practical effects and sets and models).

no one says no when you create jar jar

no one says no when you go for a cinematagraphic look that is too clean which makes the cgi more sterile (though thematically makes sense, light to ot's dark)

but you got bombass music from john williams for ot

and ewan mcgregor as obi wan and liam neeson as qui gon

and a story that parallels nazi Germany's rise

and does the exposition work needed for ot to make sense

also sweetass worlds like the wookies'

fanboys revolt and say you ruined their childhood, bully jake lloyd into mental illness

you get fed up with fanboys but still want them see your life's work continue and sell it to Disney

they reject most of your story ideas and instead rehash new hope which is opposite of what new hope was, intended to break new ground

you see fanboys love the rehash and start even comparing it to the ot

you see another director like peter jackson fuck up but not get nearly enouh same hate

a minority of lucas fans know what you did, and shit like midichlorians are just a sign of the force, not the force itself

but majority hate you

fans become as emotional and ugly and controlling like the sith despite what you tried to teach them in the movies 

you have no idea why your work has suddenly become so unpopular

because you were george fucking lucas </TEXT>

<TEXT> finally, people who can understand!

I believe the prequels use of green screen was artistically motivated.  Filmmakers do it all the time: a movie starts out bright and gets darker as it progresses, both with story, lighting and mise en scene.  

Also I'd like to point out for those who haven't watched the extras on the prequels that it had many sets (iirc 72, rewatching now and much fewer green screen was used, most of ship scenes were on sets including ; models, and existing locations (most of the Naboo scenes were shot in Italy, desert scenes in Tunisia, Anakin and Amidala's retreat in episode 2, Uncle Owen' home, they rebuilt the corridor from a picture of one from episode 4 for the ship in episode 3).  It's the bright "pure" aesthetic they were going for that made it seem artificial.

Two more points: the ot had the equivalent green screen use in its use of matte paintings throughout, to name the ones off the top of my head, Luke and Leia's rope swinging scene in the Death Star, the fighter launch bay at the end of movie one, the exterior shot of Cloud City.  

And Lucas wanted to give audiences something new; as the founder of ILM, that was by delivering vfx that had been behind the hits of movies like Jurassic Park.  I remember from the extras that he had wanted to go with the Yoda puppet in the prequels but his team had impressed him with their CG Yoda and again, CG Yoda was in keeping with the polished look of the prequels.  Indeed, it broke ground for later CG characters such as Gollum.  

Tldr: Lucas has pushed the envelope his entire career and with the prequels, has been misunderstood

An aside: I believe the pent up demand for more Star Wars was so great that anything other than nearly exact clones of the ot would have satisfied the fanbase which is why TFA was so popular, moreso when the prequels didn't give the fans exactly that (yes I'll be the first to admit it had its flaws but the shame is completely dismissing its highs, and it came from an older and more meditative filmmaker).  

Also, Lucas had been perhaps too transparent giving fans an inside look at how the sausage was made so some of the magic was taken away, and so it was easy to armchair quarterback his decisions as a director which were reduced to his working with talented people when it is par for the course and to have many bad ideas on the table to get to the good ones.

<TEXT> Yea it's the critics and users average that should be cited along with imdb, although the latter two can be gamed

edit: thought it'd be interesting to see the average critics ratings vs their RT score for recently talked about movies.

Get Out average critic rating 8.3 vs 99

Split 6.4 vs 76

Moonlight 9.0 vs 97

Manchester by the Sea 8.9 vs 96

La La Land 8.6 vs 93

Rogue One 7.5 vs 85

Arrival 8.4 vs 94

I find the average critic score much more in line with the percent of my enjoyment/quality of the movies

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> All Rotten Tomatoes tells us is the percentage of critics who liked or disliked a film.  That's it.  That scale can be 0-59 or 60-100.  It bugged me most with John Wick 2.  I liked the movie but it's not a 90/"A".  It had big problems including the redundancy of action and some illogic like at the ending, but it's still a solid "B."  Yet Reddit talks about it like that 90 on RT means the movie is infallible.  No, an actual 90 and above action movie is The Raid.

<TEXT> Absolutely no one in this thread badmouthing the movie talks as if they've seen it, it's all regurgitated generalities.  I saw it a couple days after it came out and it was fun!  Here's my review.

The Great Wall's situation reminds me a lot of Edge of Tomorrow in that it got a lot of initial hate because of Tom Cruise but the movie itself is pretty darn good. Reading the comments on Reddit, I went in expecting Dragon Blade or Warcraft quality but it was much better.

The first few moments I was apprehensive. There was a short chase we'd all seen before, then some fireplace banter, and the make or break moment where the Matt Damon and Pedro "Oberyon" Pascal first meet the Chinese at the Great Wall. It could've gone really cheesy and nationalistic but it didn't and soon we were just watching the story about a mercenary and his friend happening upon a crazy situation.

There were many things it did right and I'll jot each one down.
The relationship between Matt and Pedro was the highlight for me. Like Edge of Tomorrow, it's a shame the commercials didn't feature more of the banter between them because we were laughing each time they were together. Pedro defintely has a future in action comedies and Matt Damon's accent could pass as Brad Pitt's brother in Snatch. Also, for a blockbuster, the characters were well defined and rich with conflict.

The visuals were absolutely amazing. Someone compared it to watching the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics and it's a good comparison. You'll get to see the Great Wall, inventive battles on it, the monster cgi was actually not distracting and look better than World War Z's zombies, the costumes are gorgeous and the colors help to organize the different groups of soldiers. Please don't watch it online because its visuals are such eyecandy.

For anyone worried about Chinese propaganda, the message of the movie is cooperation and trust over greed. There are both bad and good Western and Chinese characters. I never got the sense they were good or bad because of where they were from but because of who they were. Both Western and Chinese characters kicked major ass and equally saved the day. If scenes of Chinese people kicking monster ass unsettles you, then it's just you.

The marrying of Western and Chinese elements were really well done. We got a tight Western structure and the most Chinese things invariably were the dressings on it. So there's really sweet archery from Matt Damon and kung fu and Chinese battle tactics, Lord of the Rings-type pacing and suspense and monsters and a Chinese Forbidden City-like capital. My favorite scene was the singing and lantern scene because it was very Chinese and appreciated the filmmakers respecting us enough not to cut it.

I'm a big Hong Kong cinema fan so seeing Matt Damon and Andy Lau together was awesome (they starred in their respective versions of Infernal Affairs)

So those are my two cents on TGW. It's a fun quality blockbuster that I wholeheartedly recommend. Grade: A. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In an industry that, according to Blum, doesn't change by the day but "by the minute," he believes the only way to survive is by taking calculated risks. He sees the success of "Get Out" as the perfect example of what Blumhouse does best, and it's miles away from the major studios' thinking.

"Jordan's script had been around for quite some time  no one wanted to make it, and I understand why: It's bananas," Blum said. "We did it because I read the script and I thought it would be amazing. If you make something on a respectable budget, you can make weird stuff. Did I know it would be a hit? I had no idea. But I loved how weird it was.

"At studios, filmmakers have to come into a room with comparisons. I don't want that," he continued. "If you can compare it to something, it's less interesting to me. The most excited I get is when someone says, 'I just read something and I've never read anything like it before.'" </TEXT>

Working with researchers from Trent University, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation conducted DNA tests on meat samples from Subway, McDonald's, Wendy's, A W and Tim Hortons to determine exactly how much chicken was in each sandwich's patty.

 The meat from every chain but Subway was found to contain between 84 and 90 percent chicken meat. Those looking to "eat fresh" at Subway, however, are only consuming 53.6 percent chicken meat, the analysis found.

After an initial round of testing, the team was so surprised at Subway's results that they returned to run additional tests on five additional samples to confirm their original findings.

It's important to note that the restaurants' samples were not expected to have 100 percent chicken DNA, as processing, seasoning and marinating procedures will bring down the overall ratio of chicken to other substances in the patty.  In Subway's case, the researchers said that soy protein comprised the majority of the mystery DNA in the chicken patties. </TEXT>

Also in his personal life, having a mixed background and personal tragedies but man, he's still standing and doing his thing.  Fuck you life and fuck you system! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you both have points, but just looking at the movies op is watching, they do have a dark undercurrent.  so why do there seem to be so many, my guess is like the others, the country has had a long history of oppression and only recently came out of war and a dictatorship through a capitalist mentality which has left emotional and psychological development to be placed as secondarily important.  so people are going to watch movies that speak to or satisfy that and makes those movies more popular. </TEXT>

<TITLE> What's everyone's Oscar Best Picture pick? Here's mine </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-25 00:51:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> La La Land - too light and navel-gazing, the leads' problems are shallow exacerbated by their lack of talent. Compared to other musicals it pales. Feels like the Academy will regret if they choose this like The Artist.

Arrival - too similar to Contact. Run it side by side and it's the same movie with a different "dress" and doesn't acknowledge it unlike Fast and Furious which everyone knew was essentially a remake of Point Break

Moonlight - appreciate the introspective look into black and gay life in America, but stylistically if I wanted to watch a Wong Kar Wai movie I would watch a Wong Kar Wai movie. Plus, he already made an American movie called My Blueberry Nights which renders Moonlight redundant

Manchester by the Sea - a surprisingly fluffy drama that gives a great look into life in blue collar New England and with a dour ending that may be consistent with the attitude there but is a huge downer. It felt like it should be better and got halfway there. Love Michelle Williams' acting the most but she's barely on screen.

Hell or High water - like Manchester, it's a great look into the West Texas life though doesn't feel really lived in. The story about a pair of bankrobbing brothers is fairly generic and it doesn't leave anything for you to feel or thinkabout after. Hollywood hardly makes action pics with drama anymore so perhaps it feels more special than it is like Argo.

Hacksaw Ridge - first half is dopey but forgivable since we tend to view everyone back then as simple and corny. While I dislike what Gibson has said in the past, the story of Desmond Doss, young man who stood by his convictions despite everyone being against him, is more timely in the age of Trump. The movie presents the drama of Desmond's life stirringly and it is a movie that cannot be forgotten.

I haven't seen the other nominees because they don't look interesting to me

My best picture choice is Hacksaw Ridge

edit: if it was nominated, hands down Silence would be my pick. It was a thorough gutwrenching experience, deeply moving, with no flaws in any category. Pure cinema and just a huge oversight.

Captain Fantastic would be a distant second. A fun but thoughtful criticism of capitalistic modern day life, felt rushed at the end but overall, was refreshing to see a new slice of American life.

edit2: why is this being downvoted?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've seen Contact several times, it's one of my favorite alien movies.  Run it and Arrival side by side, same things happen in the same order with very minor variation.   Arrival's literally Contact in a different "dress" with sign language and a new but stupider tragic past for the main character.  Movies are influenced by other movies all the time but Arrival crossed a line and you cant copy one of the great sci fi movies without having to at least acknowledge it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The difference is Edge made more domestically than Great Wall and hadn't begun its global run before critics stuck a fork in it, and also did not foresee it'd have domestic legs.  With The Great Wall, it already has had a successful Chinese run which critics/journalist are ignoring when writing about its performance.  Journalists should report the truth, and reporting that it's "crumbling/tanking" ignores the realities of the movie business as being global.  An objective headline would be "high expectations, performed well in most markets but below average in America, may serve as a model for future coproductions".

<TEXT> I used the links as examples of the negative reporting on its box office, which the authors acknowledge and are responding to.  When I say critics, I mean journalists in this respect.  And there were a fair amount of critics on Reddit who blew the movie off at first but I and others defended it and now on Reddit it could be considered a "hit" in terms of quality so I want to defend a movie I enjoyed.  

The theater I went to was a midday showing and was still two thirds full, people laughed at the jokes and while I was waiting outside after it ended, people had smiles so I can only speak for what I saw myself.

<TEXT> Have you seen The Mermaid?  Monster Hunt?  Journey to the West?  Those movies performed tops in China and had cg but valued story first.  If you're interested the latter two are on Netflix.  

Also, I think it's ignorant to say because movies like Warcraft do well in China that the audience's have worst taste.  It ignores the cultural phenomenon of Warcraft there and smacks of cultural superiority when we have many movies that are horrible and do well because of cg and IP like Jurassic World.

I think it's amazing that Chinese audiences will see mainstream American movies and I don't think it's because American product is that much greater but different and shows an open-mindedness.  Americans will watch foreign movies in small numbers but we could do more to be as open-minded.

Also, The Great Wall has a Western narrative structure and is a fun action movie and far from "shallow and over the top" if you've seen it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Did we watch the same movie?  Andy Lau had a lot of lines and significant role.  Matt Damon's accent and its similarity to Brad Pitt's isn't really noticeable in the trailer, it's something you notice after hearing him speak for a while in the movie. And asking Pedro and Dafoe to change is like asking Blunt or Paxton's character to change.  Though if you saw the movie, their ends are incredibly satisfying.  Matt and Jing's arcs are simple but clear which is better than many blockbusters.  I address EOT in another comment in this post.  

I'd honestly love to hear your own review of it to have a discussion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Great Wall.

TGW's situation reminds me a lot of Edge of Tomorrow in that it got a lot of initial hate but the movie itself is pretty darn good. Reading the comments on Reddit, I went in expecting Dragon Blade or Warcraft quality but it was much better.

The first few moments I was apprehensive. There was a short chase we'd all seen before, then some fireplace banter, and the make or break moment where the Matt Damon and Pedro "Oberyon" Pascal first meet the Chinese at the Great Wall. It could've gone really cheesy and nationalistic but it didn't and soon we were just watching the story about a mercenary and his friend happening upon a crazy situation.

There were many things it did right and I'll jot each one down.

The relationship between Matt and Pedro was the highlight for me. Like Edge of Tomorrow, it's a shame the commercials didn't feature more of the banter between them because we were laughing each time they were together. Pedro defintely has a future in action comedies and Matt Damon's accent could pass as Brad Pitt's brother in Snatch.  Also, for a blockbuster, the characters were well defined and rich with conflict.

The visuals were absolutely amazing. Someone compared it to watching the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics and it's a good comparison. You'll get to see the Great Wall, inventive battles on it, the monster cgi was actually not distracting and look better than World War Z's zombies, the costumes are gorgeous and the colors help to organize the different groups of soldiers. Please don't watch it online because its visuals are such eyecandy.

For anyone worried about Chinese propaganda, the message of the movie is cooperation and trust over greed. There are both bad and good Western and Chinese characters. I never got the sense they were good or bad because of where they were from but because of who they were. Both Western and Chinese characters kicked major ass and equally saved the day. If scenes of Chinese people kicking monster ass unsettles you, then it's just you.

The marrying of Western and Chinese elements were really well done. We got a tight Western structure and the most Chinese things invariably were the dressings on it. So there's really sweet archery from Matt Damon and kung fu and Chinese battle tactics, Lord of the Rings-type pacing and suspense and monsters and a Chinese Forbidden City-like capital. My favorite scene was the singing and lantern scene because it was very Chinese and appreciated the filmmakers respecting us enough not to cut it.

I'm a big Hong Kong cinema fan so seeing Matt Damon and Andy Lau together was awesome (they starred in their respective versions of Infernal Affairs).

So those are my two cents on TGW. It's a fun quality blockbuster that I wholeheartedly recommend.  Grade: A. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like Keanu and appreciate the stunts like that car chase in part two, but it's a generic movie with a bigger budget. The plot is bare bones, the action gets repetitive - shoot, break arms, head shots, get hit but hardly get hurt and looks overly choreographed, there's no depth to the characters beyond a gimmick like the mute girl. There's dozens of Hong Kong and Jason Statham and movies that do the same thing.

Personally I think the disproportionate love it gets is from corporate shills like the ones downvoting this now.

once I added the last comment about shills, suddenly the post gets replies.  hmmm

<TEXT> be george lucas

make star fucking wars

spearhead creation of indiana jones franchise

create ilm thats done cgi for every big tentpole like jurassic park

inspired james fucking cameron to get into movies

give fans up close look of how star wars was made because you want to share, knowledge they will later use against you because they have no fucking clue how collaborative movie and tv industry is, and later what an exec producer does

decide to fix a few things always wrong with ot, most good which goes unnoticed, some you prob should have left alone, but hey those fans will still have the originals 

but at this point no one says no because youre george fucking lucas 

decide to finally give fans what they want and creates the prequels

no one says no when you decide to push boundaries of film again and film mostly with green screen (though no one remembers you still used a shit ton of practical effects and sets and models).

no one says no when you create jar jar

no one says no when you go for a cinematagraphic look that is too clean which makes the cgi more sterile (though thematically makes sense, light to ot's dark)

but you got bombass music from john williams for ot

and ewan mcgregor as obi wan and liam neeson as qui gon and sam jackson with a purple lightsaber

and a story that parallels nazi Germany's rise

and does the exposition work needed for ot to make sense

also sweetass worlds like the wookies'

fanboys revolt and say you ruined their childhood, bully jake lloyd into mental illness

you get fed up with fanboys but still want them see your life's work continue and sell it to Disney

they reject most of your story ideas which is fine but instead rehash new hope which is opposite of what new hope was, intended to break new ground

you see fanboys love the rehash and start even comparing it to the ot

you see another director like peter jackson fuck up but not get nearly enough same hate

a minority of lucas fans know what you did, that midichlorians are just identifiers of a force sensitive person, not the source

but majority hate you

despite james fucking cameron, who has now internalized the star wars mantra of show them something new, coming to your defense and calling tfa a "reentrenchment"

fans become as emotional and ugly and controlling like the sith despite what you tried to teach them in the movies 

even make a sub on reddit hating on the prequels though with an undercurrent of love 

you have no idea why your work has suddenly become so unpopular

because you were george fucking lucas </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's my thoughts on it:

Read this book back in college and I thought the movie would never come out. Well, I just got back from a screening and I can't stop thinking about it in the way a chef's best dish lingers on your tongue. If you ever wondered where is God when people suffer, or beat your self up for failing to be good, this movie helps make sense of what you're feeling.

Apart from the message, the story of a Jesuit priest going to Japan to find a possibly fallen from persecution mentor is fascinating, augmented by every aspect of moviemaking that is shown with mastery including acting, cinematography, production design, editing, and costume. I will be very surprised if it doesn't rack up Oscar nominations. Nor is it inaccessible from self indulgence like so many independent movies, rather it is Hollywood auteur moviemaking that is a relic from before the era of the blockbuster and one of its finest. When Scorsese said that cinema is dead, he surely could not mean his own.

As one critic said, you don't watch Silence, you experience it and I can't recommend it enough. </TEXT>

<TITLE> With it being known that the new Star Wars are liberally using CG and green screen, I believe Lucas' liberal use of it was artistic: its polished look reflected that it was set before the fall of the Republic </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-28 17:50:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Filmmakers do it all the time: a movie starts out bright and gets darker as it progresses, both with story, lighting and mise en scene.  

Also I'd like to point out for those who haven't watched the extras on the prequels that many sets (iirc 72), models, and existing locations (the govt building at the end of eps 1, Anakin and Amidala's retreat in episode 2, Uncle Owen' home, they rebuilt the corridor from a picture of one from episode 4 for the ship in episode 3).

Two more points: the ot had the equivalent green screen use in its use of matte paintings throughout, to name the ones off the top of my head, Luke and Leia's rope swinging scene in the Death Star, the fighter launch bay at the end of movie one, the exterior shot of Cloud City.  

And Lucas wanted to give audiences something new; as the founder of ILM, that was by delivering vfx that had been behind the hits of movies like Jurassic Park.  I remember from the extras that he had wanted to go with the Yoda puppet in the prequels but his team had impressed him with their CG Yoda and again, CG Yoda was in keeping with the polished look of the prequels and indeed broke ground for later CG characters such as Gollum and Caesar.  

Tldr: Lucas has pushed the envelope his entire career and with the prequels, has been misunderstood

An aside: I believe the pent up demand for more Star Wars was so great that anything other than nearly exact clones of the ot would have satisfied the fanbase which is why TFA was so popular, moreover when the prequels didn't give the fans exactly that (yes I'll be the first to admit it had its flaws but the shame is completely dismissing its highs, and it came from an older and more meditative filmmaker) Lucas had been perhaps too transparent giving fans an inside look at how the sausage was made so some of the magic was taken away, and so it was easy to armchair quarterback his decisions as a director which were reduced to his working with talented people when it is par for the course to have many bad ideas on the table to get to the good ones.

<TEXT> Americas culture of tipping serversthe standard is now 25 percent in some marketsmeans that waiters in upscale restaurants are making far more than those in the kitchen who prepare the food

Theres a need, Chiarello said, to balance pay better for talented young cooks making near minimum wage with some of his waiters who are now earning $90,000 a year, as tips can total $250 a night. 

 While servers are rewarded for exceptional service, cooks end up making less to make their food great every time, Chiarello said.

 just as customers may unfairly penalize their servers with a bad tip if the food isnt satisfactory, they may also reward them when the food exceeds expectationsboth things the waiter does not control. So the tips dont correlate with whats actually going on at the restaurant.

 Chef Waxman said it doesnt make sense for a server in one market to earn a minimum of $15 an hour before tips, and one in another market to get $2.13, the federal minimum for tipped workers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My thoughts on Silence

Read this book back in college and I thought the movie would never come out. Well, I just got back from a screening and I can't stop thinking about it in the way a chef's best dish lingers on your tongue. If you ever wondered where is God when people suffer, or beat your self up for failing to be good, this movie helps make sense of what you're feeling.

Apart from the message, the story of a Jesuit priest going to Japan to find a possibly fallen from persecution mentor is fascinating, augmented by every aspect of moviemaking that is shown with mastery including acting, cinematography, production design, editing, and costume. I will be very surprised if it doesn't rack up Oscar nominations. Nor is it inaccessible from self indulgence like so many independent movies, rather it is Hollywood auteur moviemaking that is a relic from before era of the blockbuster and one of its finest. When Scorsese said that cinema is dead, he surely could not mean his own.

It's only playing in a few cities now but if you get the chance when it's released wider, I can't recommend Silence enough. </TEXT>

So I definitely won't be watching either Passengers or Assassin's Creed this holiday break.  I know there's hype but in the end that makes my self-hatred worse and I'm tired of subjecting myself to that when there are so many other movies to watch which I know while I may not love, that I won't at least hate myself for  </TEXT>

Ironically it's a movie that's about magic but it forgets that magic makes you believe in what's possible first then wows you, but in Now You See Me 2 and most CGI-heavy movies these days, nothing is impossible so it all becomes a one note bonanza.  I am much more impressed by a movie like The Prestige or the underrated Shade with Sylvester Stallone that is realistic. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Just saw Mr. Plinklett's video, all flash, no substance, and also I'm tired of people shitting on Lucas.  The guy is behind Star Wars original and prequel trilogies, he has more courage in his pinky than all two hours of The Force Awakens.  I'll reiterate the prequels were flawed but were original and had some really great stuff and deepened the OT, also episode three alone is a classic.  It's shitty that people give him no credit for Star Wars when as a director/writer he was ultimately responsible for episode four, and as exec producer he was ultimately responsible for five and six. 

Anyone know of defenders of the prequels on youtube? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Watching The Nice Guys, a movie everyone on here gushed over and it is boring.  The comedy is flat, the dialogue is self indulgent, the plot convoluted, Gosling's acting and the typical teen girl is annoying, I didn't care about any of it and yet r/movies and most critics loved it.  Personally I think it's either you guys worked on this movie or it's to support movies like this but sadly you've chosen this movie.  Since you guys can't distinguish between a good movie and a polished but below average movie, I'm not trusting your recommendations anymore. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mine would be Zootopia.  The movie was thematically complicated, fun, and every second counted for the story.  Other movies regardless of genre where I was in awe of how they made it are Predestination, Memento, Kingsman, Oldboy, and the original Star Wars.  I'd like to know what your movies are as I think those are the movies to next watch. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I will watch adaptations of other films, sequels, but I will not watch  reboot/remakes like Predator or Magnificent Seven or what's worse, the reboot/remake masquerading as a sequel like Star Wars: TFA and Blair Witch.  Thanks to Ridley Scott who didn't just (re)make Prometheus an "Alien in sheep's clothing" as the original screenplay by Spaihts had done.  

I want original stories especially since it's easier than ever to watch the original via streaming or dvd. 

Now I'm sure some of you will come back and say there's no such thing as originality, well a line has to be drawn somewhere and that is the reboot/remake.  So please if you have a choice between watching a reboot/remake or a new story, watch the new story instead. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've read in articles ticket sales are way down for x number of reasons, but I'd like to hear them anecdotally.  For me the reasons I haven't been going are: 

Work keeps me busy and going to the theater is a trek so staying home is easier

Tickets are expensive, around 10-14 dollars, I still remember paying 4-6 dollars, now I have to think about the price

The image at home is HD so not too bad

I don't want to deal with the crowds when I can be comfortable at home

There's been too many reboots of films whose originals is the only version I need.  It actually makes me mad that there's so many original/existing IP that hasn't been turned into a movie and instead we get remakes like Ghostbusters and Ben-Hur.

I'd rather hang out and do another activity than sit in silence with someone for two hours

I've seen so many movies it doesn't give me the same thrill.  Movie trailers used to wow me, but I think I've seen the Earth and its monuments destroyed every way they can be.

I'd like to see more tangible craftsmanship like models to make the experience feel more real.

The movies themselves haven't been appealing.  The last movie I saw in theaters was probably Star Wars: The Force Awakens.  The last movie I actually liked was Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation.

I don't really like many movie stars and the ones I do like don't make too many movies or ones I'd want to see them in.

Appealing movies like Predestination come out on VOD.  

TV has stepped up their content to be more cinematic.

That's all I can think of, what about you guys and girls?

edit: I feel I should add some things that'd bring me back to theaters.  Cut ticket prices, reduce number of trailers, less excessive use of CG and more models (why I love Christopher Nolan so much), market smaller movies as they would a big movie, more original movies, fewer reboots </TEXT>

Just thought of a couple I liked: 21 Jump Street.  I think maybe I enjoyed it because I never saw the TV show.  The Mission Impossible series, too.  As far as I know, they didn't copy the plot scene for scene of the originals, which was hard to do anyway since they're TV shows.  Maybe Hollywood can take a lesson from this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like Cerrone, I wasn't impressed with how he fought Silva.  He laid on him for three rounds and hit him with pot shots.  In my mind, I think in a real fight, there may be multiple guys attacking, or biting and headbutts so Cormier's style of lying on a guy for x minutes won't work, that the best fighting style is on the feet and yes ground game is important but not if you can't advance.  It's like I can't suspend my disbelief but am I missing something that it really is effective in real life and I should appreciate Cormier's style more?

*I appreciate all the comments.  It helped me gain a new appreciation for Cormier's style even though I don't find it appealing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never even asked to vote by mail but I got one anyway.  I just went to vote and on their rolls, I was listed as having received a mail in ballot. The election worker said I needed the mail in ballot so they could make sure I don't vote twice, that I could go home to get the mail in ballot or get a provisional ballot which we've all seen by now probably won't be counted.   Luckily I live down the street.

So bring your mail in ballots to the polls OR vote by mail postmarked by the end of the day, a witness' signature is required on the envelope.  I recommend voting at the polls so it's counted today in the tally.

<TEXT> My source is the blu-ray collection's commentaries and interviews in the bonus features so I will undoubtedly be missing many more examples.

To give context, remember that in the OT, blue screen was used for cockpits and space fights, matte paintings were pervasive such as the exteriors of Sky City and the farther backgrounds inside the Death Star.

Digital must have made the most sense to Lucas. Audiences had been loving ILM's photorealistic work (which he founded) on Jurassic Park along with nearly every nineties blockbuster, to increase to an epic scale and have certain things like the duel on Mustafar it could not have been done otherwise, and they did have a budget.

I think there's a misconception there is more blue screen than actually used because the prequels are the most obvious example but that had been the trend in blockbusters, the original trilogy didn't use it nearly as much because the technology was nascent but now nearly every movie and show uses it for even basic scenes, and aesthetically it looks so clean that real objects are mistaken for digital as you'll see below, but it makes sense to the story as the Republic was at peace.

Lucas due to his mandate to show audiences new things as he had with the original trilogy at times took it too far but that's from a well-intentioned desire and boldness that we loved the OT for.
On location: the Tattoine scenes at the homestead, around Mos Was (with some comped in miniature models of houses for the background), Padme's palace was shot in Italy, Padme and Anakin's retreat was shot in Italy at Lake Como

<TITLE> Chris Pratt is basically Seann William Scott (Stifler) who broke out into the mainstream </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-26 18:38:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Firstly, they look similar.  They also both started out playing cocky doofuses, Seann in American Pie and Chris Pratt in Wanted and Parks and Rec, then they started to scruff up with facial hair and bulk up, Seann with The Rundown and Stark Raving Mad, Chris with Guardians of the Galaxy, but Chris hit the mainstream while Seann has an enviable career as well.  

I'd argue that Chris has a less weaselly face, more broad-jawed, and the Parks and Rec role helped humanize him, while Seann didn't have that role; this limited Seann's appeal whereas Chris's appeal expanded.

Seann needs to get on that sitcom. </TEXT>

It asked if I wanted system restore, I clicked yes, startup repair still in progress.

System repair finished though wasn't entirely successful.  Don't know what happened with system restore as though I clicked yes that second time, no further action by computer was taken.

The computer turned off, I freaked out a bit, turned it back on and selected start normally and prayed, it did start normally, no longer stuck at the update screen, I saved all my important files to my flash drive, tried turning Windows update off from task manager but it turns back on and gobbles up my computers resources, so I'm going to step away for a bit and let it do its thing.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> They took something I love and made them fight to the death.  And they made me complicit by watching and paying for them to put on the horror show.  I liked the dinos more than the cold-but-comes-around ron howard in a wig and heels, the arrogant and unwantedly creepy and got what was coming to him billionaire, and the annoying teen who grows to love his brother - yawn.  I hated the humans for making the dinos for their amusement and profit, then making them choose between their dino-bros or humans (the velociraptors).  We did not need dino-hybrids, because you may have no imagination and love the original dinos doesnt mean we lack.  We did not need a military team going in to kill dinos, imagine if you had to watch Harry Potter and his friends get shot up, or the animals at Seaworld.  And we are supposed to care when the pterodactyls attack humans?  When they have dino-shamu in a itty bitty tank and make T-Rex fight and get injured in their battle?  If they're trying to make a point that we are guilty, make it in a documentary not a summer blockbuster.  Just rewatch the original instead because the real monster is this movie.

<TEXT> When I don't dress up or I haven't washed my car, the cashiers aren't nearly as nice if I do.

I was in line first but the waitress stops checking me out as I'm paying and checks out an older man.  

I see a cashier flirt with a handsome customer and when I come her smile disappears.  

A rich man asks only me to move away at the bar so he could watch tv though there are many other people there.

A Vegas dealer asks only me to stop bending the cards though I'm not the only one doing it.
