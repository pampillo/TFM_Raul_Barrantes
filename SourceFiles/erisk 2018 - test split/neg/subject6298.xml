<TEXT> There was this one time when out of curiosity i accidentally cut my mother's bracelet in half with a razor. My mother always put a razor in her jewelry box (i still don't know why) so i tipped the razor a little from it original position and put the broken part of the bracelet on top of it to make it look like the pressure from closing the box press the bracelet against the razor and cut it. My mother didn't say anything about it so i think it worked out well. </TEXT>
