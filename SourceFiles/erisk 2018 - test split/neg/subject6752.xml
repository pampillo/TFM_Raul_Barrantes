<TITLE> Have you guys found a solution for the Smart Switch app saying that it lost connection to the iPhone? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-09 19:20:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Just received my S8 and I'm trying to transfer my files, however, Smart Switch sees my iPhone and attempts to look for the data. When it finally reaches 99%, the app says it lost connection to the phone. I have tried this like 3 times.

Using wireless doesn't help as the S8 doesn't see my iCloud backups. 

Any help? I'm not looking forward to transferring things manually but if it comes to that, then I will do it.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Greetings! 

Couple of questions about the change:

1-) Does Samsung Smart Switch support Whatsapp? If not, what's the best way to transfer Whatsapp messages between the two OS?

2-) Can I change the round icons in the phone and keep the same launcher (I preferably want to keep Bixby on the left)? I don't like the way the icon looks assuming this is stock: http://imgur.com/a/feXGl

3-) How long does Samsung take to ship promotions? I am interested in the free Gear VR. If they also launch another promotion, are current owners eligible or is only for new customers?

4-) How do you deal with apps that don't take full advantage of the display (displaying black bars to fill in)? Most apps have this or just ones that have not been updated in a long time?

Anything else I should know?

Thanks in advance!

Do you think websites like iDownloadBlog or 9to5Mac were as actively as they are now when they started?

Not really. Just set up avoiding adding fingerprint, passwords, and/or Apple ID, then install the Pangu app. Once that is installed, Jailbreak and delete the app. Afterwards, go into safari and go to jbme.qwertyoruiop.com and create a Home Screen shortcut to it.  </TEXT>

Do you even use BT? Explain to me how Android (or literally any other device) devices know when you want to connect a BT mouse as opposed to a Speaker? 

 Connect known device, drive, disconnect device, the phone marks itself as parked.

Wrong. Since you are telling me that my phone can't differentiate between what I connect to it, I took a trip to a random location in my area and back to walk with my Bluetooth headphones (used in one way only) that are known to the phone. I used Maps' Navigation and all Siri can do is tell me this after I finish the route: http://i.imgur.com/eUcwBLm.png .

<TEXT> It shows up as that, but BT actually tells devices what they are.

Your iPhone outputs a signal saying, "hey, I am a phone."

You car, however, could be outputting its signal as a BT speaker, which will tell the phone to not record where you park the car as you know, the car isn't telling the phone it is a car. 

I tested this when my family rented a '17 Explorer. The car told my phone that it is a car and I was able to see where it is parked, but my stepdad's car didn't.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Innovation can also means when someone takes a solution and makes it better.

Ex: Mobile Payment and Fingerprint on Phones

The ideas weren't made by Apple, true, but I believe we can all agree when I say that Apple innovated with the mobile payments. It also even forced Google to make an app to follow suit (Google Wallet - Android Pay) and Samsung got in the game.

For Fingerprints, Apple didn't invent thay. Motorola made a phone with it first. Once Apple implemented in their phones and improved the solution (in-app, mobile payment, etc) everyone else followed suit.

In the Airpod's case:


Is Apple the first to make Bluetooth earphones that aren't connected by a wire? No. Does that mean Apple innovated with them? Arguably. Look at the way it handles audio. With most Bluetooth earphones, the audio signal goes into one ear piece and then from that ear piece, it's sent to the second ear piece. The problem with this is that this creates a lag of 30-40 milliseconds or so while the audio is sent to each ear piece and then synced up together. That's fine if you're just listening to music, but if you're watching a movie or something, the audio will be off. Apple fixed this by sending two Bluetooth signals, one to each piece. This means that there's no delay while audio is sent from one piece to the second. That's innovation in my book. No, not the definition where they had to invent something new, but the definition where someone grabbed a solution and made it better

<TEXT>  i'm curious how water resistant it really is.

I believe what I did was more strong than showering with the phone.

I took the phone to DR for vacation. I went to a water park, and took photos underwater and used my phone in the surface of the pool. Once in a while I would go on slides and record myself going down. At the end of the slide there is a 4-5 feet pool so to be safe I would raise my hand grabbing the phone so it doesn't go deep down, but it could still get its share of water splash on it. 

Everything works fine until this day. Just be smart about it. Don't take it to the 10ft area, for example. 

Some YT (specifically one from EverythingApplePro) videos shows that the phone can even beat the Galaxy S7 in a water resistant test. Note that the 7 is rated IP-67 and the S7 is rated IP-68 </TEXT>

<TEXT> Disclaimer: I stutter

Basically my English teacher decided to make my whole seat column (3 tables with 4-5 students each) read a line of a poem. In these situations, I would get ready to say it. I say the line under my breath and when is my turn I just raise the volume. However, I failed. I stuttered. Hard. My classmates laughed at me and even the teacher, so she thought it was a nice idea to repeat the same shit again back to back with the same poem, me reading the same line. Stuttered hard again.

While some of you see this as a bad experience and that my teacher is an asshole, she made try to overcome my stutter and learn how to control it. If you tell me to read that line again, you will be God damn right that I won't stutter </TEXT>

<TEXT> Transcript for those at work, school, house, library, or in space: 

Royal Giant: Deploy Time to 2sec (from 1sec)

Tweaking his deploy time gives the defender a bit more time to react to Royal Giants played at the bridge or in the pocket (on your side of the Arena once a tower is down). Listen to the latest episode of Radio Royale for more insight on this change and some of the others below!


Elite Barbarians: Hitpoints -4%, initial attack comes 0.1sec slower

This change will make Elite Barbarians a bit easier to deal with. They'll still be a threat and can take down big dudes on defense before going on a counter push, but they won't be quite as punishing.


Furnace: Hitpoints -5%

Furnace offers really nice support to your offense, but its high hitpoints also make it a bit too strong on defense. A small tweak will help here.


Goblin Hut: Hitpoints +5%

Goblin Hut has lived in the shadow of the Furnace for long enough! This change, in conjunction with the one above, should make them both interesting and viable options depending on your deck.

Electro Wizard: Hit Speed to 1.8sec (from 1.7sec)

Electro Wizard offers a bit too much damage and control for a ranged support troop. A lower hit speed will tone him down in both areas.

Executioner: Damage +6%

Now that all of the Executioner's bugs have been ironed out, we can return him to his former glory! This will also make him a great option for countering the increasingly popular Lava Hound based decks.


Balloon: Death Damage delay to 3sec (from 1sec)

It's great to see the Balloon become a more viable offense card since the last change; however, we'd like to add a bit more Death Damage delay to allow for better counterplay.


Skeleton Army: Skeleton count decreased to 14 (from 15)

Another critical change to maintain the delicate balance of "Skeletal equilibrium" within the Arena. Probably.


Lumberjack: Hitpoints +4%

He's strong, fast and drops an interesting Rage effect, but in many situations he simply lacks the hitpoints to be really effective. A few more will help!


Please leave your thoughts and feedback on the forums or reddit!


Edit: Formatting looks good for me. Can anyone tell me if it is messed up on their side so I can fix it?

<TEXT> Hopefully OP responds, but I believe what happens is this:

If you are Host and assuming that you are in a CEWL session, you are basically using the session you are in as a "pool" for other players to join you.  When they join, they will be on the session until you launch the job and get transferred into the job session. 

Now, if one of these peeps quit the lobby when they join, they will be left in the session. They **won't** get transferred to another one. See what's happening here? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got banned. 

Reason? 

I asked to mod a month ago. Q responded and asked if I spend time in NYC, which I responded to "I'm a permanent reaident here". He also asked if I could meet with him.

Since I thought he wasn't serious, I responded to him again to see if that's his real purpose/if he is not joking.  He wasn't. He wanted to meet me. So I just ignored the message and moved on.

Now, I took a screenshot of the chat and posted it as a comment as it was being talked about in the post I believe OP posted. Note that I never made a post shitting on the mod, but talked about it when it was brought up.

Now, I don't see where I broke a rule, so I will contact the admins to see if this is mod abuse or not. </TEXT>

iTunes backed up both of your phones before updating. When the update finished, it asked you which backup you wanted to restore. You selected your wife's.

iTunes did exactly as you told it to do. 

Also, note, looks like you pressed the Restore button which will delete everything, including the OS to install it again. You didn't press update that doesn't delete/overwrite data.

In all seriousness, I've been jailbreaking since the iOS 4 days and I do know what I am speaking about. 

You are vulnerable by jailbreaking. Example is SSH. If you install SSH without changing root password (believe it or not, many people don't change that) gg. 


The attacks you previously used to gain root access are still open. If your phone falls into the wrong hands then 
\\\_()\_/ 

About performance, it is hindered. Anemone was the culprit of being a CPU hog in the past weeks (although that was fixed).

If you were to follow the comments in Reddit, Facebook and pretty much the internet, you wouldn't have an Apple product and Apple wouldn't be a thing by now. I wouldn't even have the iPhone 7 and the Macbook Touchbar if I followed what people say here \\\_()\_/

As an user of both, here is a few reasons:

1-) For developers, MacOS is similar to Linux (shell). MS doesn't offer that natively. Python runs out of the box on Mac but you might need extra tools on MS.

2-) [Best Support for their machines.](https://www.macrumors.com/2017/03/10/apple-tech-support-showdown/)

3-) One of the best trackpads (if not the best) in the game

4-) Hardware working with the Software. Not just basic things like keyboard backlit. You can get that on a Surface, but not on other things. 

5-) Arguably, good design and durable hardware. A Mac can easily last 6+ years.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Such as?

Something that pops in my head is that you buy something and you get a tracking number. Let's imagine you just bought a $10k computer. Of course you don't want anybody to steal it from you and stuff. 

Anyways, now imagine I bought your history. USPS, for example, has the tracking number in the URL, so since you visited that to track your package, I know when is it coming, via who, and I can do a plan to steal it from you. All I had to do is buy your history. 

 What would happen to me if that happens?

If what happens? The negative impact? Look at an example above. 

 but does it really matter if it doesnt affect you?

Well, it does affect me, because is either, we all get our net history sold to somebody, or we all don't. AFAIK this isn't an opt out thing. I definitely don't want people to buy my, or my family's history. We don't do anything bad, but I don't want people to snoop in on whatever the fuck we do.  </TEXT>

Yes, which brings me to the next point, how bad is a W in a transcript? Will it get overwritten if I take the same class again? This can be an option for me. 

 to mention will your professor even let you retake it later?

That's what I don't know. We will discuss it tomorrow. 

 Maybe you can ask if you can take it early

I actually wanted to propose that to him. Maybe I can take it next Friday and learn whatever he is going to give us on April 1st, during the week. 

 you could change just your flight and meet your family later.

Seems like this is the route we will go if nothing comes out of this.

 spin it as a surprise trip from your parents

Maybe this was a bad strategy, but this is why I did it. To tell my profs that this was a surprise trip, and that my birthday is on Spring Break as well. 

I will try convincing him to let me take it on the Friday before I leave, or after I come.

<TITLE> I'm on a huge dilemma with my Saturday class. Can I get some suggestions on what should I do? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-25 00:22:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Greetings /r/college!

On April 1st, I am leaving the country for two weeks. I will miss one week of class (the other is Spring Break). 

All of my professors of my weekday classes are okay with it, as I won't be missing out much (only 2 hours of lecture, which I can catch up with a book or with friends). However, with my Saturday classes, I will be missing 4 hours, not 2. My Saturday class is a "double period" class so one class counts as two. Since I will be gone for 2 weeks, I will be missing 8 hours, as opposed to 2 of other classes. 

On April 8th, I have exam 2 of this class, and I failed the first one (my professor drops 1 out of 3 tests), so if I want to have a chance of passing, I should take exam 2 and try to pass it. Since I will be out of the country, I can't take it. 

Tomorrow I will have a chance to speak with the professor. What should I do to have a chance to pass?

I can't change my flight due to several reasons (changing flight fees, fees to change hotel reservation, fees to change car reservation and among of other things). We (family and me) reserved everything well before the semester started. We reserved in November, semester started on January.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Apple's Secure Element has a flaw introduced since iOS 8 and it hasn't been fixed yet </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-22 23:59:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> (Sorry for shitty title. I didn't find another way to express this in a headline.)

Allow me to explain. 

For short, AP will be Apple Pay, SE will be Secure Element (not iPhone SE. iPhone SE will be referred to the phone). 

Remember when Tim Cook told you to not blink or you are going to miss it in 2014? He was referring to AP. Apple's take on mobile payments. It is cool and everything, but how exactly does it work?

Well, think of it like this. 

**1.**You phone sends encrypted data when you are adding a card to AP, to Apple. 

**2.**Apple decrypts that data to know which bank you have, and encrypts it again and sends the data to your bank. This data includes everything about your phone (model, phone #, IMEI, etc etc). 

**3.**Once your bank gets that data, they send it to Apple, encrypted, and Apple directly sends it to your device. This data has the Device Account Number and dynamic security codes. 

**4.** Now, once is in your device, this data is sent to the SE. The SE will save your card's info to allow you to use AP. **Note that the SE is separated from iOS or WOS.**

When you are going to pay in stores, the NFC will wake up the phone, to tell you to authenticate yourself. The Secure Enclave comes in to verify your fingerprint and will return a "True, this is me bro" message to the NFC. The NFC will then communicate with the SE to pull the card you authorized the payment on, and process the payment. 

Looks simple enough right?

Now, this is where the bug comes in. Did you notice the bold sentence above? That's where the bug comes in. 

When you restore your device, or your bank deletes your virtual card, the OS (iOS or WOS) tells the SE to forget the card's data. In some cases, you even receive a confirmation email from your bank saying that your card was removed. 

But the thing is that the SE fails to delete your card in some cases. When you are setting up the device again, and you are going to set up the same card the SE fails to delete, you will have a message similar to [this.](https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/img_8932.jpg?quality=82 w=2500 h=0#038;strip=all w=1000). This message appears in between steps 3 and 4. 

Now basically your card is banned from Apple Pay in your device. If you grab another device, and use that same card and add it to Apple Pay, it works. But it won't do with the phone with the problem no matter how much you try. You can restore, setup as new, from backup, whatever, and the card won't be deleted from your SE.



The only solution is to replace your phone, effectively giving you a new SE that doesn't have an idea of your card's info. Unless Apple comes with an update to its restoring process. 


_____

In my personal experience, I had this issue with iOS 8 on an iPhone 6, iOS 9 on a 6S and now on 10 with an iPhone 7+. 

In iOS 8, my debit card couldn't be added to Apple Pay. My bank says everything is good. Apple says everything is good. I just dealt with it until before iOS 9 came out when that's where I had a theory what the problem was. Apple swapped it out and it worked. iOS 9 came, I got the 6S, and the issue happens with my Credit Card a few months in. Apple swaps it out and works as fine. Now I have an issue with a different card, on iOS 10, on my 7+. 

Apple's customer service is trying to give me the run-around as they don't know what the hell I am talking about (I don't blame them), and I am having difficulties reaching an engineer in Apple so that the issue is fixed. Hopefully sharing this in a public forum will help me contact an engineer who can look into this.

Can I those cards to protect them against a Wiz + Ice Golem? Or Valk + Ice Golem? 

Point being, is that there are still counters to the ebarbs regardless of what the ebarb users carry.

You good. You vote- kicked as instructed.

The thing is that, if you are in a session with 17 people, including yourself, and a random comes in, that will be 18 right? 

Well, to kick that random, you will need 9 people to vote kick them. And the kick has a cooldown of 15 mins, so is hard to kick randoms who keep joining with that timer and the 50% vote kick stuff.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The S8, G6, Xperia XZ, OnePlus (4?

Do people seriously think these companies started manufacturing their phones in September? 

The S8 (per reports) started development even before the S7 was released. Samsung never knew Apple will not include the jack. 

Same applies to LG, HTC, and other companies when they release their flagship devices. 

In the case of the HTC Ultra, there is no way they developed that phone in just two months. So it took it from Motorola, who released their "no-jack" phone on July </TEXT>

 Why does it need a buff?

 For 7 elixir it's the only card that can't take a tower by itself (I'm fine with this, not all tanks should take a tower

Glad you know that ("not all tanks should take a tower") The Hound is supposed to be a tank. It serves the same purpose in CoC. In CoC, people use it to have building tackle it while other troops destroy it. 

  It has low health

For a tank is fine. The pups could use a tiny tiny buff in HP, but is not necessary. 

 Has very few synergies

I'm not sure a buff will fix this. However, for the Hound's purpose, it doesn't need a lot of Synergies. Remember, the Hound is mainly a support/tank card. Think the lavalloon. Who makes the most damage and it is untouched until after the Hound is destroyed? The Balloon. 

 Isn't a threat at all by itself and is easy to counter. 

I wouldn't say it is easy to counter. Is the Giant easy to counter? And of course it isn't a threat. Refer to point 1.

 Has MULTIPLE hard as fuck counter

So does every troop. Trick is to kill these counters so the Hound can keep living. Use a rocket or Lightning

 EVEN worse when one tower is taken because of it's bullshit pathing

As a Hound user, I agree with this.

Next week, a different breed of high-flying vehicular competition hits GTA Online with 20 new Stunt Races custom built for the Rocket Voltic, Ruiner 2000   Blazer Aqua in Cunning Stunts: Special Vehicle Circuit. Designed with each of these vehicles' unique characteristics and abilities in mind, this collection of Stunt Races comes to GTA Online on Tuesday, March 14. Also on Tuesday, Legendary Motorsport adds the classically-styled Progen GP1 to its formidable roster of supercars.

And to gear up for next week's Special Vehicle Races, we've also got a flight of new GTA Online bonuses kicking in this weekend and running through Monday, March 13th (on top of ongoing specials including Double GTA$   RP Stunt Races). Aspiring kingpins can claim their own high-rise for 25% off Executive Offices and Office Garages before taking advantage of CEO bonuses all weekend long. To help satiate your thirst for carnage and gear up for Tuesday, Warstock is slashing the SecuroServ prices on Special Vehicles. Special Vehicle Missions will also dish out Double GTA$   RP throughout the weekend, allowing you to earn big while getting acclimated with the Special Vehicle of your choosing. Bodyguards and Associates are also getting a Double GTA$ salary bump this weekend </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wut?

  "Bluetooth connection issues in a watch OS beta led to bricked devices that had to be repaired at an Apple Store"

These watches weren't repaired. You know how you plug in your iPhone and restore the iOS? Same thing Apple does with the watch. Reason they tell you to send it to them is because the special cable is not available for sale. 

 You let folks with devices that they can afford to lose data from try betas first before you rush in and get all sad when your phone can't hold signal anymore or the mic stops working.

But these folks asked for a beta program to ensure their apps are working before a public release, and Apple gave it to them. Also, think about if the signal or mic bugs you mentioned are released to the public, wouldn't it create chaos? Isn't it better to let people who *volunteer* to test a new iOS version report the bugs? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Get the app for PC/Mac, and log in to your PSN ID and connect. No need for PS+

If you are away from your system, connect the PS4 via USB cable or use this fi you want wireless: http://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-dualshock4-usb-wireless-adapter/5589800.p?skuId=5589800 ref=212 loc=1 ksid=9916f2a9-fdc2-495e-aa13-f782fc5775a4 ksprof_id=15 ksaffcode=pg129308 ksdevice=c lsft=ref:212,loc:2


Ideally you will want another burner account connected to another PSN to remote play if you are using a computer and you are at home close to the PS4. Why? Remote Play in computers acts as a remote that you can't do much with, so if you want to use your remote, that's connected to the PS4 and not to the computer, you will have to do this.

<TEXT> I'm looking to purchase an iPhone 7+ Matte Black (32 or 128GBs), however I am looking for a device made between weeks 46-50 of 2016. 

Is it possible for any NYC Retail worker to check inventory to see if they have a device that's old enough?

You can see when the device was made with this website: http://sndeep.info/en

<TITLE> [IDEA] GTAO 1.5 DLC </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-19 19:27:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> ^^^Please ^^^Youtubers ^^^Don't ^^^Steal ^^^this. ^^^thx

I know there have been rumors of R* slowing DLC for the game, but this is just an idea, because why not? 

If you guys didnt know this, GTAO is set in a time thats before the Trevor-Michael-Franklin trio. You can confirm this by going to Franklins new house and if you take a peek inside, there is nothing related to Franklin. I also believe Trevor and/or Lester make references to this by saying that they know someone but they haven't heard from them in long time. 

Due to this, I was thinking that 1.5 could make us go forward in time, matching the time where SP mode starts. Specifically when the trio meets for the first time. 

Once you boot up the updated game, you will enter a solo session. You get an unavoidable call from Ron. 

R: Hey, I need you to come here. We have a pretty big situation with Trevor here. Help us.

No context. Nada. The game prompts you to go to TPI. As with Prison Break  Plane there will be no NPC traffic so that you can get there faster and get back to gaming. 

Once you get there, Ron will prompt you to enter Trevors house, where you will find Franklin screaming at Michael and Trevor saying Stop fighting bitches. Trevor sees you, goes to you and presents you to the gang. From here and forward, a small talk happens, but the TL;DW/DR is that Trevor offers you to help the rest of the gang. 

With this new DLC we now have Michael missions. Some I can think in top of my head are: 
	2 player mission to spy on Amanda to see if she is cheating with another one of her teachers. We find out that they are and we are required to kill this rich teachers guards (about 10 of them) while he escapes in a top-range car. 

	2+ player mission to take revenge of various members of a gang that have been molesting the family. Sort of like a survival mode.
 
	Rescue Tracey from a place in Paleto Bay and bring her back a la Slasher style. You enter a place up there (I dont know much about PB) and play through a Maze, with no Flashlight, only with a Pistol, no pickups, no mini map, to rescue Tracey. You got a regular Kuruma waiting in the back of said place to escape. No Pegasus vehicles allowed. 

	Jimmy just bought a VR for his system. However he is trapped in it by a hacker (hallucination) who is controlling him. Lester enters with a box and suggests that we enter the game. We have to brute force into the system to find the hackers IP. Once we get that, Lester will look up the IP leading us to a house in Murrieta Heights (near Lesters house) and we are going to beat the kid up and his friends.

With Franklin, there isnt much I can think about, but it can be stealing cars, and/or killing gang members.

Some of the mission in SP could also be ported to support 2+ players in GTAO.

We also have new Heists. All the Heists from SP are ported to Online. Setups can be accommodated to support 4 players. In these Heist and setups, instead of the gang doing the work, they will be in the walkie talkie talking to us and we do the work. 

Some QoL changes for this DLC are:

	Voice pre-sets for our characters: Im seriously upset that we cant talk to the characters in the game. What could be done is that we choose a voice, out of 5 that will say the lines assigned to that role. I dont see how hard could this be. 

	Voice assistant: Saint Rows has this. I wish I could say GTA Pegasus Buzzard and I can hear the Thank you message and my $200 being deduced. Or I can say GTA Request Vehicle. 

	Sell properties. 

	New phones. Instead of using an iPhone, I wish I could switch to a Windows Phone or an Android. 

	Enter properties you own and instead of going to your apartment directly, when you enter, you will have a lobby and you can use the stairs or elevator to go to your apartment.   There can be activities like Dart and etc to play with other players.

	Changing brightness in Online rather than going to SP to change it. 

	More Yacht activities. 

	Having workers in the warehouse. When you reach the warehouse, instead of you going in to place the product in the shelf, someone does it for you. This is mainly useful for those solo players that do crate runs and cant carry more than 1 crate. 

	The assistant can stand up and do various stuff in the office. For example, calling her while you are outside your office, gives you the option to source a car, or buy crates. Of course, the crates will be in a place not close to you. 

	LJT stops fucking calling every half a second. 

I would gladly pay full price of the game again if R* makes this a thing.

<TITLE> Guys, can we get serious about kicking randoms? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-18 16:21:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was in a session yesterday as usual doing CEO work, when a couple of randoms entered. 

I first noticed a Lvl 70 came in. I set a bounty on them and proceeded to vote to kick them. 

I already saw the boot, so I was glad someone else got the bounty heads up. 

However, the random stayed in the session for about 7 minutes with the boot and no one else doing anything. 

Thankfully, a member decided to spam kill him to create pressure and leave. Be advised that this random also denied to do my request to leave via a text message in-game. 

Same thing happened with a lvl 20. 

Few hours later, a random came in, and invited his friend. 

No one was voting to kick him (the first random, not the friend) even tho I set the heads up with a bounty. 

I sent various messages to both randoms and they proceeded to bad mouth me via their mics as "they aren't doing nothing wrong".

They both ended up leaving the session. Though. 

Can we get serious about it? Not only that these randoms will join and invite their friends, but the game will make other randoms, enter the session with them. 

Special thanks to some of out members like JasonBlue_, as he made sure everyone voted to kick. There was someone else, whose name I can't remember at the moment, who also tried to message everyone and asking for a reply back to confirm whether they voted or not </TEXT>

<TITLE> New PS4 gamers, YSK that you can buy the Playstation Protection Plan within 1 (one) year of your PS4 system purchase. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-14 21:42:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've read from the last couple of months conflicting info whether you can buy warranty after X amount of days. Some say 30, some say a year, but the way I did it, and how the PS customer service advised me to do it, gets you a warranty extension within 1 year of purchase. 

All you simply have to do is head over to the PS Store, on the PS4 itself and look up Protection Plan. 

**Note: I was told this by a PS Customer Service: "If you buy it from a phone or a computer, in the long run it can affect you because when you buy it from a PS system, they get the serial number from where the purchase comes from, and the plan is attached to that same serial. If you don't, the plan may or many not be applied to the serial number of your system"**

Then, you will have two options: [Protection Plan *with* Accidental Damage](https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/playstation-protection-plan-ps4-accidental-damage-36-months/cid=UP9007-CUSA00289_00-PS4ADH0000000000) or [Protection Plan *without* Accidental Damage](https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/playstation-protection-plan-ps4-non-accidental-damage-36-months/cid=UP9007-CUSA00290_00-PS4NAD0000000000)

Both plans are at a 10% discount for PS+ Members.

After you purchase the item, you will get an email confirming the purchase. From the day of purchase, up to 15 days, you will receive an email, welcoming you the plan. One day later, you will receive the plan's number, in case you need it in the long run. 

Once you get the second info email, call PS and just ask if your Protection Plan is active. They will help you out. 

In my case, I bought my system on 11/23/15. Bought plan on 11/22/16 with one repair case in the middle (July 19th). Called in today before making the post to make sure everything is good and not spread misinformation and PS support did confirmed that my Plan is active, until July 19th of 2019. 

Good luck!

Edit: Forgot to mention:

The Plan requires you to have Proof Of Purchase (POP). If you lost it, many retailers, like Gamestop can print it to you, email it to you, and even send the receipt themselves to Sony </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Pekka is now a 'somewhat' viable solution for the RG, and Elite Barbs (both with negative trades). 

The 1sec deploy also helps you as it can overwhelm your opponent in 2x time. She works like a Giant now. 

The only thing that annoys me of her deploy change is the sound. You can hear when she activates and like 2 seconds later "Ergh destroy".  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Has anyone noticed how close is Android Wear 2.0 to WatchOS? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-09 00:20:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> From [Google's Blog](https://blog.google/products/android-wear/android-wear-20-make-most-every-minute/): 

 "The Google Assistant on your wrist

 Android Wear 2.0 brings the Google Assistant to your wrist, so you can find answers and get things donehands free. Ask your Google Assistant about the weather or remind yourself to bring an umbrella. Make a restaurant reservation or navigate to work. You can even update your shopping list right from your wrist. To ask for help, just hold down the power button on your watch or say Ok Google." The Google Assistant is available in English and German on Android Wear and will be available in other languages in the coming months."

Siri on the Watch. Although, Google Assistant is better, but the execution is similar to Apple's. 

 "More personalized, helpful watch faces

 You can now personalize your Android Wear always-on watch face with information and actions from your favorite apps. Simply glance at your wrist to check your next appointment, stock performance, progress on fitness goals, or whatever is important to you. A quick tap on your watch face lets you instantly order an Uber ride, start a workout, or get in touch with your significant other. Interested in different info throughout the day? Just swipe to switch your watch face as you go from the office to the gym to dinner with friends and home again."

Possible since WatchOS 3. It isn't clear enough, but it looks like complications are a new thing now. 

 "Better ways to work out

 Google Fit, the pre-installed fitness app on most Android Wear watches, now lets you track your pace, distance, calories burned and heart rate* as youre walking, running or cycling. You can also measure weight-lifting reps, in addition to push-ups, sit-ups and squats. When you work out with a cellular-connected Android Wear watch, you can stay in touch with calls and messages, stream tunes from Google Play Music and still use your favorite apps right on your watch."

Activities and Workout apps. 

 "More ways to respond to messages

 "Now its easier than ever to read and respond to a message right from your watch. When you receive a message, you can expand the notification and tap to respond by dictating, typing or handwriting your answer, or drawing an emoji. Try it out on apps like Facebook Messenger, Glide, Google Messenger, Hangouts, Telegram or WhatsApp. Need to respond quickly and discreetly? Use Smart Reply, which instantly and intelligently suggests different responses based on the message you received."

Dictation, Smart replies are thing since WOS 1 (?),  and Sketches are a thing since WOS 3. Only new is typing. 


My intention isn't to circlejerk. But, is interesting to see how Google bases an update on Apple (I know it can go the other way around). Don't get me wrong, competition is good, and I hope to see an actual and real race on smartwatches.  </TEXT>

Veexillium had an update, and tried to upgrade it. I was met with this error: http://imgur.com/a/UjC9s

I tried other packages just to see, and they installed just fine. I uninstalled and tried to install the theme again, same issue

I cleaned the device in iCleaner (I checked the options that are related to Cydia), and nothing.

My theory is that Cydia is trying to continue downloading the .deb from where it failed, so it will keep doing this until I delete the downloaded file. Anyone know the path to the tweaks in Filza? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Yet another good experience from Apple's customer service. </TITLE>

<TEXT> Last week, when copying and pasting a code, I noticed my "V" and "C" buttons were a little, down. Like they had something stuck under the keys. 

I looked up what should I do, and the recommendations where to get a compressed air spray [to clean my keyboard](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205662).

I figured Apple would have that on their stores, and just paid a visit just to double check and see what they could do. 

[The Genius, took my TB MBP in, did an MRI, and everything was fine. However, she did a "physical" test and only saw the "C" key was "depressed".](https://imgur.com/a/JmyJ8). 

The Genius told me "Hold on, I am coming back". Got that email and I saw that "Estimated Turn Around Time" and I was getting ready to know what should I do, while my computer was in repair. 

The Genius comes back, and tells me, "Well subject6752, hold on a few minutes, I am getting the replacement papers ready."

The what? But isn't my computer being repaired? 

5 minutes later, she comes in with a brand new computer. Sealed box, everything new. Opens it, takes the new computer out, gives it to me, takes the old one and puts it back in the box. "You are all set subject6752".

I'm still lost, I didn't understand what happened for a second. 

She told me "I noticed you are going to college, and as a programmer, you need your computer right away, so I convinced my manager to just replace you the computer with a new one on the spot."

So, Mr. Manager and Ms. Genius from the 5th Ave store in NYC. Thank you. I still can't believe I got a brand new computer for just one key being "depressed".  </TEXT>

TLDW:

* Best vibration in any smartphone. Period.

* Apple is "future thinking" the wireless life? Yes. Are they agresive about it? Yes. Is the lack of a jack a pain in the ass? Yes. 

* Best camcorder. Period.

* Camera is on par with Samsung's but photo processing is top-notch. 

* If you are on videography or photography and you want a phone, iPhone is the best choice. Especially the 7+.

* A10 is lit. It is considered the best responsive phone for Marques. No phone is as smooth and responsive to that. The Pixel and the OPO 3T are there, but not there. 

* Battery Life is about the same as last year, okay, but not great. The 7+ is really good on battery.

* "Apple, you made the phone the same dimension, and increased the battery. Keep doing that"

* Biggest complains: No jack, and no USB C.

<DATE> 2017-01-15 22:32:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is what I have in mind:

* Create a website with jailbreak info, news, tutorials and etc. Maybe name can be jailbreak.me (.com is taken). Content can be curated by posts from this sub, submitted via email, or just from the team members. 

* Twitter handle for support and news (Facebook too). 

* Email support too. 

* Youtube for tweaks showcase, and how-to (HT Jailbreak, HT fix cellular/data bugs in iOS 10 are examples).


Mainly I am looking to make a No-BS project (no clickbait, no fake JB news/info). I feel this could help the whole JB community (not just the Reddit part of the community), and could actually ease tensions of devs asking for help/info

PM me!

<TEXT> Sorry for shitty title. I didn't know how to word my problem in just one sentence. 

Here is the problem I am having:

I am using IF ELIF statements to take "different routes" in my program. 

Here is a snippet: 

http://pastebin.com/GcWN8r9T

Whenever I try to choose the second, third or fourth route, my program outputs the first route. 

Here is an example:

I chose route 2: "T"

My program goes the "C" route.

If I choose "T" - "Area", it will go "C" - "Area". 

What am I doing wrong? I can't figure out what the actual issue is                                     </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Strategy][Deck] Elite Barbs and 3 Musk deck that got me to my PB (3822) from High A8, low A10. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-08 21:37:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys, first Strategy/Deck post, so if I am doing something wrong, please tell me! 

I know he Elite Barbs (referred as EB henceforth) are pretty disliked in the community, so they will get a nerf soon. However, during this time, I tried to use them until they get nerfed. To my surprise, they shot me to almost 4k, from 2900-3020. If they helped me, they can help you. 

My deck is based on both, the EB, and the 3 Musketeers (3M henceforth). They are both my win condition cards, and they both are also my defenses. 

My deck is composed from the 3B (lvl 11 [lvl 10 works fine here as well]), 3M (lvl 7), 3 minions (lvl 10), Musk (lvl 7), Elixir Collector (lvl 7), Zap (lvl 10), Archers (lvl 10), and The Log (lvl 2 [will provide alternatives in its section])

#Why do you use those cards?

EB: Win condition card. They are fast, strong, and can support most spells. They almost never go alone, unless I know my opponent has no elixir. They are also my main defenses. Golem can't kill them (death damage), Giant Skeleton can't (Death Damage), Pekka takes 3 shots to kill them. Overall, they have no direct counters. Now, one thing I hate to have the EB go against with, is the Ice Wizard. They become slow and attack like the reg barbs. If you have an IW, and you go against me, I would hate you and love you too (I love all my opponents..... I need some friends). So a IW, and a Sk Army will do great against the EB. Just keep it in mind (and is also an equal trade). 

3M: I hate them tbh. They are weak to every spell (you know what I mean), are weak against death damages (Golem, Giant Sk). If you leave them alone, they can rekt you however. I use them for the simple reason that some people will fireball, or Lightning the Barbs, and when they do, I use the 3M as they won't have a spell to kill them. In the replays below, you can see that. 

Elixir Collector: Pretty straightforward. You have a 9 elixir and a 6 elixir card. You need to have elixir to have a chance to use them and cycle. 

Minions: Support and defense. They only go with the barbs as support. No much to say.

Musk: Instead of having 3 musks, why don't you have 4? No, I don't use them like that, but like the Minions, she is Support, Defense **and bait**. She is the one to let you know if the opponent has fireball and etc. 

Archers: Support and defense. Not much to say. 

Zap: Sparky reset, inferno tower reset, everything reset, and helps with Sk Army. I also use them so that my EBs have an advantage against other EBs (think reset). 

Log: The positive elixir trade king. Kills princesses, Sk Army if Zap isn't available, gets rid of tombstones and the skeletons that get out when it breaks and pushed back troops. What else can you ask? Now, if you don't have it, you can use a Fire Spirit, Ice, or Spear Gobs. They aren't great alternatives, but is something.

#How do you play them?

Here is two wins (two battles in one video): https://youtu.be/QuxiZ4DkHJI

Here is two loses (2 battles in one video): https://youtu.be/O_Ue2JChmNM

I hope I have helped you, and use the EB while it isn't nerfed! It can help </TEXT>

<TEXT> First of all, Happy New Years!

Based on a Codecademy lesson, I made my own version of [Pyg Translator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin#Rules).

I was looking to add more features, and one of them was to detect whether the user entered a word starting with a consonant, or a vowel. 

I tried using the .startswith(vowel) function, after I defined vowel in an array, but a syntax error comes up and I can't figure out what actually is the error. 

How do I go about this? If possible, I would like to set up an if function to check for this. 

For those interested, the code is here: http://erickjreyes.me/PygTranslator/ </TEXT>

I currently have a checking account with BofA (student account). I planned to open a Savings account with them, however, to avoid fees I need a $300 (or 2.5k) or link an interest checking account (which I don't have). 

Is it advisable to open a checking account (for students), to avoid paying monthly fees and start saving up? I plan to go with a Capital One 360, or a Chase Student Account.  </TEXT>

My main interest to flash a stock firmware is to use the ASUS router app in my phone to enable parental control and disable it, without me needing to go to a computer to enable/disable it.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [ASK] Doesn't the game balance cards based on what you have and what not? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-26 05:41:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Whenever a common is released, I can easily get it to tournament levels. Rares take a little bit of challenge, but is easy to get it to tournament levels. 

Now Epics and Legendary cards seems to not follow this pattern.

2 weeks after the tornado release, I have been opening Gold chests, Magical chests, and etc, but no Tornado was given to me. I also noticed this behavior when I reached new arenas. For example, when I reached A8, I got the Bowler 3 weeks after. 

For legendary, I believe we should have a higher chance to get other legendary cards we don't have, as a opposed to getting the same ones. Some people in my clan, including me, have found the same legendary cards again and again. 

In my case, I have opened/purchased 4 legendary chests. I got 3 logs and one Princess from it. I mean, I like the log, but I would very much prefer not getting it if it means that I have a higher chance of finding the others. 

Am I just going crazy, or is this how the game works? </TEXT>

<TEXT> As my mom was doing the dishes, she ran the AW under water to clean it (nothing spilled on it though) and it died. It wouldn't reset, it wasn't connected to the phone, it was dead. I put it on the charger and it wouldn't react to anythig and left it there until I can send it to repair on the A-Store.

One day ago, it came back to life. Like nothing happened. It didn't know what time and date it was as it didn't connect to the phone however. 

I tested everything, vibration, sound, and everything was fine. What could have happened? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Since we can't do our MC business nor CEO business is Private and/or Invite only, we have to resort in having to play in Public lobbies.

But the thing is that doing it in a full lobby will bring clusterfuck and loss of money. So that's why I resort in finding "semi-empty" lobbies to do my business.

But I'm always getting kicked out of these lobbies so I never can do my MC Business. I don't shoot unless I am shot first. I don't go and hunt crates to destroy. I just do me and if you need help I'm in.
Anyone else experiencing this?

Here is a video so you guys can see that I'm not hostile to anyone and I'm getting kicked.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Looking up Rockstar Support on this sub, most of the posts here are from bad experience people have so I wanted to share mine, because I believe we have to share both sides.

First of all, about 3 months back, I had an issue with [a player taking over my yacht in Passive Mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrB16CWrJuI) and I opened a ticket. They asked me how much I "lost" and I told them $30k. They ended up giving me $130k. 

Now, one week ago, I traded my Maze Bank (main) for the Maze Bank West. I was supposed to get $1million and some more and I didn't.

I emailed them and within the hour, they gave me $1.9 million. 

I personally believe they are pretty good. I have seen people losing cars and support doesn't help them, so I'm not sure what was the playing factor there but they helped me out twice and without talking back and forth or a bot answering to me. So, thank you Rockstar for that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Greetings!

After being requested 3 times, and no one stepped in, I decided to do so. So, without further ado, here it is! http://imgur.com/a/9TGo2

However, I have a problem. The images size suck and the king emotes are laggy in terms of frame, so I need you to help me out!

See what I am talking about in a quick demo here: https://youtu.be/zoLcN-FDAus

I need you guys to get me good file pictures and gif, of the emotes and text. For example, a big crying king. The file must be less than 500KB. I also plan to include troops in the pack, or maybe they will be separate. I don't know, I am still brainstorming. 


~~After everything is done, I will drop the IPA (iPhone application file) file after I speak to the legal team over at SC. This won't be in the App Store as I don't have $99 to sign up to be a full developer but you will have the chance to sideload this.~~

Nah this is going straight to the store after is done.

<TITLE> I have a 629 credit score. What should I do to increase the score before I finish college? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-03 19:27:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello PF!

First of all, thanks in advance for the advice and help. 

I have a 629 credit score (which is average). I started doing my credit when I turned 18, back in April, and got a CC from BoA with a $600 limit and a 21.75% APR.  

I always use the card for everything that I need and pay off the full balance every month (never been charged interests) If it helps, I use like 70-85% of the limit. 

What should I do to increase my credit score (it seems to go down over time) before I finish college? My main concern is that if I don't have a good score, I won't have a low interest for a car, and/or I can't get a good apartment if my 'future' landlord decides to run a credit check.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-09-28 22:52:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The catch however is that it has to be offered on the same configuration of your Watch. Some people let you swap to any band however, so test your luck.

For example, I got a Series 2 42mm Gold AW which is offered with a Cocoa band, and a Coffee Toasted Woven Nylon. I got the Nylon band, so I had the option to have it changed to the Cocoa one.

On my experience, however, the store couldn't do this due to system error, so I contacted Apple and they said to go back to the store and speak to a manager. I did, and she let me swap to any band that I want, so I got a [Midnight Blue band](http://i.imgur.com/iCfqdHV.jpg)

So if the system fails, just don't fret and go back tomorrow when the staff is different. You might even get a different band than what's offered  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Personal Opinion: Every day I hate the game even more, and I don't want to. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-27 17:04:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Warning, this will be a long rant and you might not agree with everything I have said. So, let's keep it civil and if you don't like my post, just hit the button and move on. Simple. I know "one less in this game, bye, yadda yadda". Remember this is a personal opinion and I need to vent out :) 

Okay. Ever since launch day on iOS, CR has been my favorite game. I played it in class, train, hell everywhere you can think about. However, each day I have started to hate the game even more to the point where I'm in the edge of uninstalling it and forgetting about it. Here is why:

1-) **Most players aren't original**

No one is original in this game. Well, let me rephrase that, most of the players in this game aren't original. 90% of the last 50 games I have played, include at least 4 troops that were showed in Youtube or somewhere else. Is the same deck all over, same gameplay, same everything. If I do want to at least win I have to adapt to that deck (to counter and push), however, I refuse to do so because I want to use my own deck that I built on my own (never seen it in YT or somewhere else), and not some copied deck. 

Also skill-less decks. Spawner decks to be specific. That's something that will drain your elixir trying to counter it except if you don't have like a bomber or something like that

And this bored me. I like games where there is always a challenge, something different. I only enjoy the game when I see unique decks. 

2-) **Supercell tries to fix problems using band-aids**

Not a good analogy, but, hey, is something :p

I like when game developers want to listen to their player base and try to do the best to make them happy. I personally don't think Supercell is doing it. 

* On 8/24, they decreased the time it takes the RG to shoot. I don't think that helped. His range is still a problem. He freaking stands literally half a step in front of the bridge covering anyone behind him. So if you ever counter the RG with melee troops (that don't have cannons, bows or spears), good luck. I don't think anyone will stop using the RG after this change.

* No love has been shown to the Wizard even tho this community have asked them to fix it.

* The Giant is **overused (like the RG)**, strong and has a massive amount of health. After many complaints, they haven't said anything.

~~* Poison is still a strong card. It slows you down and attacks you at the same time? The rage just speeds you up. I think they have to change one thing. Either, boost the damage of the raged troops by at least 5% (I mean, that way strong troops aren't more stronger now), or remove damage from the poison. Their call.~~ Nevermind. I was wrong on this one. My bad

* New players are struggling to move up due to players from A7 and above dropping for trolling and for other reasons. We have told them several ways to fix this and they haven't said anything. 

PS: Just FYI, I consider myself to be a good, I have [tournament level cards](http://i.imgur.com/y1EwUPC.jpg) and I'm able to put up a fight. I say this in case someone comes and say that I just suck, or I just don't have tournament level cards

<TITLE> [Discussion] Jailbreak 101 - A guide for new jailbreakers Part 2 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-23 15:54:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> What's up! I'm back again with a second guide of jailbreak, but this one is special. Here is why:

Apple is prone to stop signing 9.3.2 and 9.3.3 really really soon. 9.3.3 came out [one month ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/4tg81s/release_ios_933_has_been_released/) and 9.3.2 has more than 2 months being signed!

So if Apple stops signing these versions, you can't restore to them anymore and your jailbreak can be a goner. So here is a guide to prevent you from losing your jailbreak!

________

#Table of contents

1-) Restoring
2-) Installing Jailbreak again
3-) Tips

_______

#1-) Restore. NOW!

You should restore just to have a clean copy of iOS 9.3.3. It will also help as you might clean your phone before restoring :) 

**However**, iTunes will restore you to 9.3.4 if you don't provide iTunes the ipsw file for 9.3.3. Here is what you'll do:

1-) Download the ipsw file for your device from the link over there ()  - ipsw.me/9.3.3

2-) While the file is downloading, BACK UP EVERYTHING YOU WANT. Use Google Photos, iCloud Photo Library, iCloud, use anything needed for what you want to keep. If you don't want something, [let it go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0MK7qz13bU), it will just occupy space. 

3-) Time to restore! Now, to restore, go to iTunes (with your phone/ipad/ipod plugged in) and go to the device's info. 

You see the first box with the storage, serial, and phone number (if applicable)? There should be two clickable boxes there. Update (this might change depending on which iOS are you on) and Restore. Hold the Shift button on Windows and the option button in Mac and press Restore. 

*"Oh shit /u/subject6752, this dude is asking me for a file. Tf did you tell me to do?"* I just told you a few steps so that the NSA can have your location and can get you! (insert diabolical laugh here). No. Chill. Remember the first thing you downloaded in the first step? That's what iTunes is asking for. Go ahead and select that and press "Ok, Verify, Accept, or Allow". Whatever comes up there that means something positive. 

You should have a clean copy of 9.3.3 now! Go ahead and restore that backup you made. 

**NOTE: This also applies if you are on 9.3.4 and 10.0, however, the backup can't be restored due to having a higher OS. So, if you want to go to 9.3.3, you can do so, losing all data. You can also restore the backup you made when you left 9.3.3**

_________

#2-) Installing Jailbreak again

Now that you just installed 9.3.3, is time to get you jailbroken again.

There are various way of doing this. 

You can use Cydia Impactor (desktop app) to sideload the Pangu app, you can use the Chinese version, or you can jailbreak via Safari (there is a method working). Whichever appeals to you. 

There are a plethora of YT videos that show you how to jailbreak using a PC, but I will show you the Safari version.

1-) Head over to www.pgyer.com/TTJB9 (make sure you have the capitals on 'TTJB')

2-) You see the Chinese version of the jailbreak? Good! Now press the green button there. And press "Install" on the pop up

3-) ***This is where it gets kinda tricky***. After you press the Install button, head over to the home screen and find the app that's downloading. Watch it closely. The reason is because you will need to open up the Control Center (have it open after you find the app) and enable Airplane Mode after the status of the app goes from "Loading" to "Installing". 

4-) Did it install? 

No? Repeat Step 3. 

Yes? Good! Don't open it though.

Go to Settings - General - Device Management (under VPN) and select the profile called "Beijing Hong Yuan Online" and press verify. After it is done, go back to the home screen and open the app and jailbreak!

__________

#3-) Tips

Here are some tips to ensure that you will always have a jailbroken device unless you decide to restore to update to iOS 10.

1-) Never. And I mean NEVER. Install a tweak that is not compatible with your version. You see BiteSMS in Cydia? Looks beautiful right? It makes you want to install it right? DON'T! The last iOS support for BiteSMS was iOS 7 so it is prone to cause issues on your iOS 9 phone. 

2-) Don't go all crazy installing tweaks as there are a few that conflicts with one another. What you should do is look here in the sub the name of the tweak and you will see if people have issues with the tweak conflicting with another tweak. Or if they have issues that you want to avoid. 

3-) Install Cydia Eraser as the first tweak you install. Why? Because you might be stuck in certain situations where you are jailbroken (tweaks work) but Cydia crashes. Or any other weird issue. So you can use Cydia Eraser to erase the content of your phone.

However use C-Eraser after: 

* Backing up
* You restored the language/font files of iOS
* You have tried to boot in No-Substrate mode (holding the vol+ button while jailbreaking) and Cydia doesn't work there. 

4-) Install Power Tap. It is a good way to get to Safe Mode if you ever need it. 

5-) Also, if you don't have access to a computer and you need to restore and jailbreak, use Cydia Eraser and jailbreak via Safari method explained in Step 2

_________

#4-) FAQ

**What do you mean by Apple signing an iOS version?**

It means that Apple decides whether you can restore to that version of iOS or not. They do this for security concerns. 

**I want to restore because I'm having an error on Cydia**

You might need to stash. See this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/4ugzui/release_stashing_for_92933_get_more_space_on_your/)

**How long does the certificate last?**

It lasts up to April 2017. And I don't think it matters because there will be an iOS 10 jailbreak before this time. ^^^I ^^^have ^^^hopes. 

**You think you are funny by making corny jokes up there () with that Let it Go shit and the like?**

Bro. You have beef with me? Let's go! ()  (`)  ^^^I ^^^do ^^^it ^^^because ^^^I ^^^want ^^^to ^^^be ^^^cool ^^^:(

<TEXT> I just noticed today after a long loss streak. 

If you have a Level 3 Mirror, and you have it on your deck along with level 1 rares, commons or epics, mirroring them will upgrade them for just 1 elixir more. 

So with a Level 3 mirror, those rares go to level 6, the commons go to level 8 and the epics go to level 3.

Is you look yourself at the mirror, with no accessories on your face and your mirror shows you with glasses, hat, and etc

I always thought they were capped at that level. This makes the Mirror a freaking strong card... </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Greetings! 

Our family is in search of a new car. We are not sure where to start, what to research, or what to expect when going to the dealership. 

Our family is composed of a mother, and 3 brothers (where I'm included) and an elderly person (main reason we want to get the car). 

Here is some info about us that can help:

* Mom makes about $1.2k a month (around 
$14.4k/yr) 

* I make about $6k yearly. 

* We are on public assistance, so we get Food stamps, Medicaid, and assistance for rent (we only pay like $100 of $1k of rent)

* We live in NYC.

* No debts

* $245 of bills (internet, cable, and mobile phones) 



Questions:

1-) Is it safe for us to buy at car of $8k (2007 or newer)? We mainly look for a car so we can transport our grandmother (and take her out to have fun, she suffers from Demencia and I've heard that helps).

2-) If we do decide to get one, which manufacturer should be good for us in terms of cheap gas cost, and cheap maintenance? We look into getting a SUV/crossover.

3-) I'm 18, my mom is 45, how would insurance work? What is something we must be sure to do when insuring the car?

4-) Must likely, we will buy from a dealership. What are some tactics they use to get more money out of us, and how should we counter it? Any tips to get the dealship not to make us overpay?

5-) Any websites or app I can use to check inventory of a dealership? How should we conduct our research?

6-) Anything else we should know? 

Thank you for the help guys! I appreciate it!

In the past 4 days, we have increased the numbers of subscribers from [121,207 readers](https://imgur.com/a/MAUdA), to 123,911! This means we have new members who are first jailbreaking and are probably lost on what to do, so I'm looking to solve that issue!

4. Things you should be aware of

_____

#1. Themes/Setups

Looking into pimping (informal definition) your device? Jailbreaking can help. 

If you don't know where to start, head over to Cydia, and tap Themes. This will give you a list of hand-picked Themes that are popular within the community. Some are free (at the moment of this writing there is not a free theme in the featured list), some are paid but look around and I bet you can find one that appeases your needs :)

Do you have a theme? Good! First step done. Now, do you want to customize even further? Head over to /r/iosthemes and on the search bar, type the name of your theme. You will find setups made by somebody else, and you can get inspired by them! You will always find the tweak list in the comments or the Imgur description so watch out for those. Common tweaks used to customize the device are HideMeX (iOS 9 -- Not updated *yet*), and Springtomize 3

For example, my theme is Veexillum, so I type that in the search bar and I will get setups for this theme and get inspired!

Also, if you want to change your font, checkout Bytafont 3!

Have fun!

____

#2. Tweaks

Is hard to recommend tweaks as tweaks are basically per needs (for example Snap + for Snapchat if you use Snapchat, if you don't you don't need it)

I do recommend you to go to /r/findatweak and ask if there is a tweak that can do what YOU want. 

However, the Essential tweaks I see people installing over and over are:

**Activator** - This tweak will help you accomplish something, by completing an action. Do you want to play music when your triple click the volume + or - buttons? Set it up with Activator. Do you want to send a message when you put your pinky finger on the Touch ID sensor? Activator can help. 

**BioProtect or Biolockdown** - These tweaks share a common purpose, to protect your apps/settings with your finger (Touch ID), however they both share different options. The option are available in a [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pLKgDYxJRUgtp81nsHK-x9qVUkbZ52NxP1HAMZNGKt8/edit?usp=sharing) file to save space in this post. 

**CCSettings** - Looking to turn off cellular data from your Control Center? Turn on Hostpot? Turn off GPS? CCSettings is for you. 


Looking for more tweaks? See this [Master Cydia Repo list](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/2qmk6m/repos_master_cydia_repo_list/) by /u/codeoriginal

#3. FAQ

**What is this Jailbreak?**

Is a semi-**untethered** jailbreak. I like to call it an "On-Demand" jailbreak. What does it mean? First let's get familiarized with some terms:

**Untethered** jailbreak: This means that you can reboot on the go. Once you jailbreak the first time, you won't need to use a computer again to mess with the jailbreak unless you want to restore or use a file manager

**Tethered** jailbreak: The total opposite. You can't reboot on the go as you will need a computer to jailbreak again. The thing is that you device will be a brick without booting tethered again using a tool

**Semi Tethered** jailbreak: This is a jailbreak that allows you to reboot your device, but not without some consequences. After rebooting, you may not be able to run any Cydia jailbreak apps, and even some stock apps like Safari may be inaccessible. A SemiTethered jailbreak is normally a tethered jailbreak with a package installed that allows you to reboot with limited use. You must perform a tethered boot to regain full functionality to your jailbroken device. 

Now, this one is a **Semi-Untethered** jailbreak. Can you guess what it is? Yep. It is a jailbreak that will let you boot disabling the jailbreak (stock apps will work as opposed to semi-tethered), however with the press of a button in an app and locking your device, you can have jailbreak again. Why is it called Untethered? Because you don't need a computer to enable the jailbreak. 

**How do I jailbreak again?**

Open the PP app, press the big circle, and lock your device right away. The device will respring to a jailbroken state

**Can a tool be made to make this untethered?**

Maybe. 

**What happens after the seven days?** 

No one is sure. But if the PP app stops opening after Sunday, delete it (from the Device Management settings under Settings  General)and go to https://totoateam.com/pangujb/ and press the "Install (arabic letters)" link and Accept/Install everything it asks you. 

**How do I unjailbreak?** 

Restore on iTunes

**I have an error on Cydia**

You might need to Stash. See this [post on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/4ugzui/release_stashing_for_92933_get_more_space_on_your/). 

**You are awesome /u/subject6752**

I'm not. I'm just doing my helping duties ^^^I ^^^Know ^^^I'm ^^^Awesome ^^^;)

#4. Things to avoid

* Piracy repos and cracked tweaks - The reason is that you don't know what has been added to that tweak and what can it do to your device. Stick to the default repos
* Craked apps - Same reason as above
* Installing tweaks that hasn't been updated for iOS 9. Just ask here if it works or not, the most that can happen is that you will be downv-ted (put an O in place of the "-", AutoModerato doesn't like people saying it), but at least you didn't mess up your device.
* Installing apps that can conflict with each other - Again, ask here, we will help :)

<TITLE> [MISC] Chronicles of Clash Royale -- Royal Giant </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-24 21:43:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The Royal Giant is a **common** troop, which was added to the game on February 29th.  ~~It was really balanced at this point, no concerns.~~ The few concerns were that he was useless and a waste of a card (Thanks /u/mykingislonely) However, on March 23rd, less than a month, the Royal Giants damage was increased by **20%**, because Supercell thought the [usage rates and win rates were low](https://clashroyale.com/blog/release-notes/balance-changes-coming-3-23). At this point the RG is very powerful, and on top of that, his range was increased by one on May 3rd. On May 18th, however, the RG was nerfed by 4%, and according to Supercell, he is not OP. 
This leaves the Royal Giant being heavily buffed from what he originally was before and this becomes a problem eventually, here is why:

**He is a common**
Because the RG is a common, it is easy to get. Whether it is from a Silver Chest (where every card should be a common, with no guarantees of Rares or Epics), or a Free Chest, if you are on A7, you are bound to get a card for the RG real quick. 

On a personal test I conducted, I wanted to see how quick I can get the Royal Giant to level 9. 

I got to A7 about 1 month and a half ago, and I got him on the **first** chest I got from A7. 5 RGs. I got him to level 2 (I needed one card for level 3)

I requested him to my clan, so I expected 30 RGs, and I got it. So I had 33 RGs, level 2, this bump him to level 4 (one more card needed for level 5).

I won another match, which gave me a gold chest, and I got about 10 of him. After requesting, and getting it from chest, I got him in level 9 in just 3 weeks. Im not exaggerating when I say that out of the 100 chests I opened (generic value to illustrate my results), I got at least one RG in 85 chests. Right now, Im halfway to getting him to level 10. Keep in mind that I have not unlocked the guardians, nor the Dark Prince ever since I got to A7 and I already have the RG in level 9. The three musks are in level 5.

Also, because he is a common, is really cheap to upgrade him. I have wasted 7,625 coins upgrading the Royal Giant to level 9 and if you really think about it, it is an easy amount of gold to get. In addition, a common card is really cheap in the shop. Every time you buy a card, the cost gets multiplied by 2. ~~With 510 gold, you can get 8 RG (2+4+8+16+32+64+128+256).~~ (I got the wrong equation at first. Thanks /u/TehFluffer!) The equation used on CR is y = x + 2 so with 503 gold you can get 23 RGs. Not really expensive right?
______

This is what probably gets everybody infuriated about RG. 

**He is a tank**
Because he is a tank, expect somebody who will always back him up and wont die right away if all your attention is on the RG. Popular backups are Witch, Wizard, or a musketeer. If you struggle taking down a Giant, you will struggle to take the RG down (but less struggle due to having less health).

**He is strong and he has good range**

**It is cheap in terms of Elixir**
Do you want a giant with a cannon? Pay an elixir more!

___

**Suggested solutions I have seen from the community**

* Remove the RG from every player and then add him as an epic. This will require his numbers to be reworked
* Nerf him, in all three aspects, Range, HP and damage - *Im not sure this is the right step to a solution but it can work. As long as the nerf is more than 4%.*

<TEXT> Hey guys! 

I'm having a problem with my iPhone and I'm looking for some help before I give up and I restore.

I have an iPhone 6S, with iOS 9.0.2, and something is murdering my battery.

With 50% of charge, I left my house and one hour later the phone was at 10%. Just music (streaming), no intensive game, no camera, just music.

My phone gets very warm while out of the charger and charging which contributes to the phone discharging faster.

My top 3 apps according to Settings is Narwhal with 16%, Clash Royale 12% and Safari 10%

[BatteryLife shows me this](https://imgur.com/a/SeVB4) and my Tweak List is [here](http://pastebin.com/XHBX2x5g)

Low Power Mode doesn't help. Anything else I should try?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I installed B3 earlier today and I haven't got the chance to play with it. 

Due to things, my brother takes my iPad and disables it on purpose. He got around the 1 minute wait, the 5 mins wait and just stopped there. 

After I tried to put in my password, I missed by a digit and the iPad locked for 15 mins. 

No big deal. Now, after the 15 mins timer ends, my iPad goes to 26 years of wait time. A reboot will bring the 15 mins timer back and the cycle repeats again. 

 I know I can erase it through iCloud, but is there something I should try first to gain access to my iPad (aside from waiting those 26 years)?

EDIT: I can't invoke a backup through iTunes because, well, I need to put the password to sync it with iTunes </TEXT>

**How do you play this deck? (If you have a video from your gameplay it will be better)**
**What's you weakness?**

For example, your entry should look like this:

Level: 9
Arena: 7
Deck: Prince (3), Witch (3), Wizard (6), Hog (6), Spear gobs (9), E-Collector (5) , Zap (8), Rage (2)
Gameplay: I drop Witch behind tower, followed by the prince. Then I rage them . I also drop wiz and hog together and zap hovering over the hog if an enemy troop is dropped to block it. In 2x elixir, I release my 4 main troops together and rage them while zap is hovering. Spear gobs are burner cards. 
Weakness: Legendary decks. 

#I can't try out legendary decks as... I don't have one yet :(  

EDIT: I also don't have the A7 epics, and the A8 troops (except Ice Spirits).

EDIT2: Holy shit! This blew up! I like it because that means I can help more! Keep those comments coming. I will do every single one that was posted before 7/13/16 12AM EST, just hang tight! </TEXT>

<TITLE> PS4 is not outputting video to TV, but it does output sound </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-07 02:46:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys!

I've researched this issue for hours already and no solution was able to help and I just finished my second call with Sony support but they weren't helpful. 

I was playing my PS4 yesterday night and when I finished playing, I accidentally disconnected it from the plug as I was going to charge my phone. I thought it wasn't a big deal, so I just let it off and when I turn it on today it will check for errors in the database/memory. 

Today when I turned it on, I could hear the sound coming out of the TV, however image doesn't. So I tried plugging in 2 other HDMIs and no luck. I tried changing TVs and tried the same 3 HDMIs again and the same issue persist. 

I still can access the PS4 via Remote Play on my laptop, but I can't change the display settings as it won't let me due to Remote Play being active. I have tried going to Safe Mode, and no image comes out however I tried to blindly select [the second option](https://psmedia.playstation.com/is/image/psmedia/safe-mode-ui-01-ps4-en-22jul15?$MediaCarousel_Original$) and it didn't help. 

I want to take the service route as a last option, so I'm still open to try anything. 

Can you guys recommend anything else I should try?

Thanks in advance :) </TEXT>

<TITLE> [IDEA] Game Mode ideas </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-06 18:52:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm still want to see more game modes than the normal battles. Tournaments don't really do it as they are normal battles. Here is my ideas:

#**Trainer Survival Mode**

If SC fixes the trainers, this could be effective (or SC could implement a system that Basically is that you will be fighting with various trainers until your king is destroyed. Once you kill the trainer's king, your troops will die and another king re-spawn, getting stronger by the time (increased king level and card levels).

#**Mirror mode**

This basically puts players based on your king level together in a random arena, with 8 cards picked by the game. However, both of you will have the same cards. The game should end when the king is destroyed only (no time). This is also should have its own specific count of trophies (not to be mixed with the normal trophies). Cards will be capped at tournament levels.

^I ^have ^suggested ^this ^as ^well ^as ^other ^redditors, ^so ^I ^can't ^take ^the ^credit ^for ^this ^idea, ^as ^I ^don't ^know ^who ^suggested ^it ^first.

#**Hardcore mode**

I suggested this before, but I will say it again. If you freeze your opponent when your hog is in the tower, your hog doesn't get affected by the Freeze spell. In this gamemode, every spell you throw, or death damage shall affect you as well. Expect your troops to be zapped, arrowed, frozen, or killed if you play your cards in the wrong way. This should also have its own trophy count. 

#**2x Elixir time + the last two modes suggested above**

So basically 2x Elixir Mirror Mode and 2x Elixir Hardcore. 

#**Clan vs Clan**

This one sounds stupid, but I decided to include it because why not? Kind of like Clan Wars in CoC, this mode consist on having 3 players on your clan searching for a match with another 3 player clan. However, one will be in full control of each tower. Once your tower gets destroyed, you are out of the game. This could work like this:

* You will be handed two cards (at random, and not exactly the same as your opponent)
* Elixir will be shared among each team (so if you drop a Giant Skeleton, it will be 6 elixir that counts for the total of the team)
* You can deselect cards so you can chose which troops your tower should attack (by tapping the enemy troops)
* Your king level will be set to 10. It won't decrease nor increase. 
* Cards will be the cap for the tournament.
* No legendary
* You can actually choose your team so if you know someone trolls, then you won't pick them.


Any other thoughts?

<TITLE> How the Apple Watch saved my mom </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-05 02:25:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> EDIT: At the bottom
______

My mom suffers from allergies of some chemicals found in some detergents. My mom works as a housekeeper in a hotel in Downtown Manhattan and while cleaning a room, she came into contact with one of these chemicals. As you imagine, she gets the reaction cause by the allergies and if she isn't treated quickly, she might go to the hospital

She hurries to ask her manager permission to go outside an anti allergic to the pharmacy that's right besides the hotel she works at. Unfortunately, she leaves her phone in the hotel along with cash/cards to pay for this medicine. 

My mom doesn't know a thing about medicines, so she calls me whenever she is buying one so I can look up what it does and tell her which one is better and as you know, she has left her phone in the hotel so she isn't able to call me. 

During this moment, I text her to check in on her, and the watch vibrates. She was connected to the Wi-Fi of either the Hotel Staff network or the pharmacy's Wi-Fi. She dictates to the Watch that she needed to talk to me, so how can she talk to me if she doesn't have the phone with her. So I call her. She is talking from her Watch and I am talking on my phone. She describes me various medicines for the allergies so I tell her which one is the best one. 

Now is time to pay. She tells she forgot her card and cash upstairs in the Hotel. While she was talking to me, I hopped into her iCloud just in case I needed to Lost Mode her phone. I checked her settings and I noticed that she doesn't have any of her cards on Apple Pay, but mine. So I guide her to pay with my card before we hang up (The call must be ended to pay with A-Pay). 5 minute later she calls me from the pharmacy and tells me that she is getting better and that the reaction of the allergies are slowly going away. 

If she didn't have the Watch, I'm not sure what could have happened. She forgot everything in the Hotel and going back to get it and going downstairs again could have been critical as I said, if her allergies aren't treated fast, she could be sent to the hospital. 

I'm glad I picked up an AW for her!

__________

Okay, this blew up. Let me clarify a few things:

1-) Why does my mom work at a hotel, cleaning, when she knows she is allergic to cleaning utensils? 

She isn't allergic to all of them. But she still works at the hotel, because she wants to provide to her family, one way or the other. She is going to school in the meantime as well, so this is the only job she took in the meantime.

2-) Why doesn't she carry pills?

She just buys the medicine that has the fewest pills. That's on her, I don't know why. Well, either way, she wasn't carrying any that day, unfortunately.

3-) The AW didn't save her. YOU did and the medicine too. 

Okay, I know the title is bad af (I noticed after I posted it). We all put something to save her. Me, her manager, the Watch, the medicine, the guy working at the register, the water she drank with the pills, even the fresh air saved her. Okay? Sorry for the click bait title, it wasn't my intention.

4-) She is stupid/moron/idiot. Why doesn't she know which shit to buy?

First of all, refrain yourself of insulting my mom. I haven't insulted yours, not yourself, nor your family. Okay? I respect everyone's opinion, I respect everyone's family member, but once you insult my mom, you have crossed the line. If you really need to insult someone, insult me (I wouldn't care either way) but do not bring my mom to this. Sounds clear?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Okay, first of all, opinion here, lets get it out of the way: 
#**THIS UPDATE ROCKS! Is the best thing CR has done. Props to you guys /u/clashroyale**

Now, let's talk about tournaments. Tournaments will make you even more addicted to the game, if you are addicted already. You were warned. 

First of all, your location is required to join a tournament or to host one. That's to find tournaments near you. I believe you can also search if no tournament is hosted near you. So this is a good way to get your school to play together, a neighborhood and etc. 

This is my experience playing a tournament of 50 people (Disclaimer, I finished on 32nd place due to reasons... ^^^^I ^^^suck)

- You have to constantly play. There is no doubt about that. Unless you want a chest, you need to play to secure your place. I stopped playing for like 5 mins (I was on 15th place) to get something to eat, and I got dropped to 42nd place. 

- On a tournament of 80 people, the top 40 get trophies. So if you suck at the game (^^^Like ^^^me) then you still have a chance to get a chest. For instance, I got a chest with 8 cards, at 32nd place. 

- It is a great way to get cards if you lose constantly on the regular battles. True, is slower, but hey you still get opportunities to get cards either way.

- You will get notification, in-game if the tournament is about to start. Thanks SC for thinking about this!

- You don't know who you are being matched against. Is random. Unless you remember every deck of those 79 people, then you can't know what they got to play against you. 

- You will be playing in different Arenas, not a specific one. I don't know if it is the one from the host, or based on your tournament trophies, but I played in every arena from 1 to 8 (the new 8, Frozen Peak). 

- It is FUN! 


I'd say to give this a chance. SC really killed it here, so go ahead and try to find an open tournament, I'm sure you will get into one! </TEXT>

<TITLE> [IDEA] Spotify within GTA </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-03 21:31:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> How many of you guys (or parents) have cars? A good chunk of you do. Now, if you have  a car that's at least 12 years old, your car could be equipped with a radio that has Bluetooth. That way you can listen to music from your phone, and not from the radio. 

In GTA, most of us have cars that should be equipped with the latest technology. For example, you would think that a T20, a Zentorno, or a X80 should have Bluetooth in the Radio.

You know how Michael has an iPhone, Franklin has an Android, Trevor a Windows Phone, and every character in GTAO has an iPhone as well? All those phones have Bluetooth and can have Spotify installed in them.

Now this is where my idea comes in:

For this idea to work, you will need to be a Spotify Premium as you need [Spotify Connect](https://www.spotify.com/us/connect/) and R* would need to implement the [API](https://developer.spotify.com/spotify-connect-hardware-partners/) (they don't actually need hardware). 

* Whenever you get into a compatible car (think like T20) Spotify Connect kicks in. That way you can control the music from your device or computer. 
* Whenever you get into your own house (only high end), office, or large warehouse, yacht (outside radio and inside radio, if there is one) you should be able to Spotify Connect.
* Modern Aircrafts like the Hydra, Buzzard should have it as well. 

Any other car you don't own, you can't Spoitfy Connect. Stolen car? No, unless you put insurance on it.

Also you could upgrade old cars to have Bluetooth Radio, for a pricy price (you know R*). 


For those who don't have Spotify Premium, Spotify Connect won't be available for you, however you could have a playlist in Spotify where the music could be shuffled, and filled with ads. I believe this will hurt both R* and Spotify economically so if they want, they could exclude this idea (being a free user). 

What do you you guys think?

<TEXT> Greetings /r/cscareerquestions !

I'm a sophomore in college (I haven't started the semester) and I'm worried if I don't take action soon, I will regret it my whole life. So I'm trying to gather as much info as I can so I can know what to do.

Quick background:

3.0 GPA
Study at [John Jay College of Criminal Justice](http://www.jjay.cuny.edu/computer-science-and-information-security-bs)
NYC
I actually like to create things, I love brainstorming. However, I think if I am the one who search for security issues in a program I might mess up and my carreer will be ruined

__________
As suggested by this subreddit, I might to transfer to [City College](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/sites/default/files/compsci/upload/Requirements-for-B-S-Computer-Science-Spring-2012.pdf) as John Jay focuses on forensics and cybersecurity.

Upon researching further, the salaries for being a Cyber Security Analyst as opposed to being a Software Engineer is lower (about $20k in average). 

I still want to research things further to take a final decision so I have a few questions:

1-) Any website I can see what current graduates of my school are doing?
2-) Any website to see the jobs available for each field as well as salary?
3-) Graduates of NYC, how hard was it to get a job in the field?
4-) Anything else I should be aware and should be doing to achieve success being in the field?

Thanks in advance :)   </TEXT>

<TITLE> [MISC] This game is good, but I still like to hear from CR about these issues </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-28 04:01:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First of all, please put down your downvotes pitchforks and any other pitchfork you may have. Hear me out. 

Disclaimer: I'm not ranting/whining. This is just a game. It won't affect me at all. Just giving my thoughts. 

We all complained about emotes right? Reddit, Twitter, SC forums, and Facebook users were "suffocating" Clash Royale into removing them. They got the signal and they finally spoke up. Not in our favor, but hey, we at least wanted to hear from them. I know I did. 

Now, they have not spoken on any other general issues aside from cards. I believe the reason is because we haven't spoken up, and this is what I am trying to do with this shitpost (yeah, I know, it is one. But hey, no one knows what might come out of this)

#**Matchmaking**

This is an important piece of the game. It prevents you as a level 1 in A1 to battle a Level 13 on A8.

As Supercell have stated here in the sub and [on their website](https://supercell.helpshift.com/a/clash-royale/?s=battle f=how-does-the-matchmaking-work p=web), matchmaking is based on trophies **ALONE**. 

That right there, for me is a big issue. This makes it possible so that a level 13 can drop to A1 and troll new players. This also makes people drop so they can have a chance to be in Royale TV. I can't believe a $2.3 billion company didn't think about this and on the 5 months the game has been out to the public they haven't addressed this. 

Constant complaining won't help you know, so how about suggesting something?

##I suggest that matchmaking's algorithm isn't changed. Is good the way it is. However, I suggest "downgrading" cards and the level of the king. 

 "Specifically how, subject6752?" 

Well, let's think about something. In A1, you expect level 1, 2 players right? How about you will be still be Level 13 (for example, but your health and power will be downgraded to that of a level 2 king. Just my thought. Same concept with cards. 

In addition, if you as a Level 13 have a Dark Prince, the card will be taken out of your deck for this fight and replaced with a card in the same category (epics, for example) as the dark prince is obtainable in A7, not on A1. If you do have a balloon, you could use that as is just something from one arena higher A1, not 6. 

**2nd solution:**When a level 13 reaches A6 per say, whatever loses he gets, he loses 0 trophies, but the opponent gains their trophies they were supposed to earn. That way that level 13 can't drop to lower Arenas. 

#**"Wi-Fi card"**

Now this one seriosuly affects me. How come I'm disconnected from the game to drop my troops, yet I can see my opponent wrecking the sh** out of my towers?

I have researched this high and low but I can't find the root of this issue. What I mainly looked for is whether the games are actually hosted server side (SC side) or from one of the players.

The issue has been present since January (soft launch) and no word from SC in this issue. The most funny thing is that whenever a player contacts support about it, it is always blamed on our connection. They refuse to acknowledge the issue. Heck even the [website blames it on our connection](https://supercell.helpshift.com/a/clash-royale/?s=connection-performance f=why-do-i-keep-losing-connection p=web)

I can't even suggest a solution if I don't know where the problem comes from. I just hope SC takes care of this issue. 


Anyone else have ideas to solve the issues within the game? </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Strategy] / [Deck] This deck got me to A7 + Few Strategies + clan to train </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-22 16:17:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys!

I will break up the post into three parts. The first one will be about a training clan I made for you guys only, the second one will be about my deck that bumped me from A4 to A7, and the third one will be a few strategies I use. 

### Unofficial /r/CR clan!

**Disclaimer:** This clan **is not** affiliated with SC, CR, or the mods/owners of /r/ClashRoyale. Do not send messages to the mods or SC complaining that the clan is full or you were kicked out. If any problems always ask me in a comment or private message. 

The purpose of me creating this clan is because the trainers weren't good enough to give the feeling of training (did that make sense? :/ ) I mean for fucks sake these trainers use lightning on skeletons (R.I.P Larry) which is something a normal player wouldn't do. 

So the way I want this to work is that I will take in 48 people everyday to the clan (I have two accounts), after 24 hours has passed, everyone will get kicked so that new people can come and train. I will contact the mods here to see if we can work something out like putting it on the sidebar or something along those lines. I hope to see you there! I will be on all day to help you guys out (I'm level 9 on one account and level 6 on another).

In this clan share replays and have friendly battles. You will get feedback from all this and you will be better at the game :)

#**The name of the clan is "/r/CR training" . Clan tag is LLUP9GG**

I just created another account and I will get to level 3 to create /r/CR training 2 so watch out for an edit when that's done


#To join use the word "doot" or put my username in the invitation. This is so that I can know you guys come from here
___________

#Deck

I built this deck when I struggle to get past A4. I would watch YT videos and etc, but these decks wouldn't work so I made up my own. There are some cards I use that are obtainable from higher arenas, but I will suggest a replacement when I mention them. 

* Hog Rider: This one is vital to my push. He has never failed me. When I mention the other cards I will tell you who should he go with. Always place him in front of a supportive troop.

* Mini Pekka: To be honest, I started to use her recently. I don't remember who was in her place, but now she has taken over (3). She is also vital to my push as she deals great damage and the HR and her will take down a tower if you aren't fast enough. I also use her for defensive purposes, like to kill a Giant Skeleton. As with the HR, always place in front of supportive troops.

* Minion Horde: Easily countered by arrows, but when they can clean the troops in your area real quick. I mainly use them for defense or when I know my opponent doesn't have arrows and he have use a fireball or other spell before. I also use them when I have more elixir than my opponent (more on this on strategy). When I know my opponent has no elixir, I use them with the hog or MP so they waste their effort trying to kill them, but at the same time leaving the hog or MP alive. I can expand this more if you guys want.

* Elixir Collector: The name told you everything. You can get this in A6, however, I used an spell when I didn't have this. I used either Rage or Freeze. You might as well use another troop here also like a Giant but my top choice will be a spell. Also when placing it, try to put it as close as your king as possible. Why? Because some people tend to fireball it at the same time hitting my king and that increases my defense. Also, place it down when the 2x elixir time comes. You will thank me later.

* Wizard: Obtainable at A5. I use him for defense and as a support troop for the MP and HR. As a defensive troop, I use him to kill barbs,or Minion Hordes. He is weak against Prince and Valks so use another defensive troop for that matter.

* Musketeer: Like the Wizard, I use her for defense and as a support troop for the MP and HR. As a defensive troop, I use her to kill barbs, valks, and more however she is weak against Prince and Valks so be wise and expect everything.

* Spear Goblins: I use these three for distraction only. That way I have more time to kill troops coming my way with the wiz, MP, or musketeer.

* Arrows: I always recommend carrying a spell with you. AT ALL TIMES. My top choice will be this one as you can take out Minion Hordes, or Skeletons and a bonus is that is cheap when the wiz isn't available. You can also replace it with a fireball, but my go is with the arrows. 

___________

#Strategy

* You are given 4 minutes to battle. Why rush? Keep calm and do your push whenever you have the opportunity. Take it one step at a time. Your opponent most likely will rush to take you down and will place them in a elixir disadvantage.

* Use the 2x elixir time wisely. Don't be like this: http://imgur.com/3uGcK4Z . Just try to get as much defensive troops as you can on one side only. Then when the time comes, release a hog or a MP to make the push. Also try to make your opponent go at an elixir disadvantage if possible.

* If you have to hold on to having 10 elixir, [DO IT!](http://imgur.com/gallery/5P3yozA). It can help sometimes.

* Don't freak out when your opponent has cards higher than yours. I don't know why this is part of my strategy, but hey, it helps. 

* Always drag the troops out of the dock (that's how I call it :p). Do not tap it and then tap the field because things can go wrong and you can be in a disadvantage real quick. 

* Sometimes try to let the enemy troops have a hit on your tower so they don't kill your defensive troops and you don't get messed up. This is what I do when I am against prince decks.

* Always release troops behind your tower. This can help you gain elixir while your troops gets to the bridge

* Last one, **think**. Think. Think. Don't go all crazy releasing everything at once or defending your side with some non-helpful troops. Think!!!! A MP can easily take down a wizard, so rather than putting down a wiz to counter your opponent's wiz, use your MP. THINKKKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!

I hope I helped you guys and see you in the clan :)

<TITLE> I have written an email to R* in regards to the new update. I encourage to do the same so we can see some changes at least. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-20 19:58:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello guys,

I have written an email to R*, however I haven't send it yet as I will include a link to this post and they look at your feedback too. My email is about the new update, Felony and Finance.

My concern is about the griefers and how quick you can lose money if you aren't careful or you are a solo player.

This morning, I had my first package destroyed (from my own company. I have seen packages being destroyed when working as a Associate). I had to pick up the package on a police van, which is armored like the Kuruma. Everything went fine until I was 0.2 miles away from my warehouse. A level 20 approaches me and crashes me from behind. In a sudden turn of events, I had a sticky bomb planted in the back of the van. **Boom** there I go, I'm dead and my cargo is gone. Just one sticky bomb to end my life and destroy my cargo. 

Now, if one sticky bomb could destroy my cargo, imagine how effortless will be to destroy the cargo on a Buzzard (which is quickly accessible as a CEO/VIP), or a Hydra. A quick lock-on on the van I'm driving, shoot, and that's it. 

As a associate, I had the chance to drive a van, like the [Burrito](http://gta.wikia.com/wiki/Burrito), again, one explosive shot could destroy it. And on top of that, the van is slow as fuck.

Based on what I have experienced and what other have said here, /r/GTAV and /r/gtaonline, I believe R* made this update but without thinking about balancing it so that everybody can be happy. 

I have a few proposed solution listed on my email and they are:

* **Make use of our own cars.**

- I believe all cars are "balanced" in this game. Either you have a car that's armored yet you can blow it up with one explosive, or you have a explosive-resistant vehicles that doesn't protect you from bullets. Never both. This is good because you might want to use the Insurgent, or the Kuruma to do cargo missions. Also, they are wayy faster than the vehicles provided by R* in these missions. 

* **Let us carry more than one crate if we are using our own car. We can open our trunks and frunks (in some cars), why not give use to them?**

- Seriously? Who thought it was smart to do 3 trips to pick up crates on our own car? Can we have the option to put all crate in the passenger seat or the trunk/frunk? 

* **Have a 10-minute cooldown for jets**

- A griefer can pick up a Hydra, kill and destroy, crash himself/herself and/or die in hands of another player, and pick up another one right away. This is BS. I believe there should be a countdown when picking up Hydras (or other helicopters) after you destroy it, like SecuroServ does it. Oh and make the player disable passive mode when entering a jet. I don't understand why passive mode is disabled when I enter the heli on my yacht yet passive mode is still enabled when someone enters a jet. 

* **Passive mode users shouldn't be allowed to disable passive mode when near a cargo**

- A player has been chasing me when I have a cargo, while in passive mode. After chasing me for a while and keeping close to me, he disables passive mode and throws a sticky bomb. There I go, dead. 

* **The whole lobby shouldn't be aware I have a Special Cargo. They should play a hacking game before they can figure out my location.**

- This one is self-explanatory. 



--------

Anything else R* should fix in this update? I sent them an email with a link to this post. If they open it (which I'm hopeful they will) they can see more feedback and work on it. Also, I encourage you to send them an email, with a link to this post to this email: GTAOnline@rockstargames.com

<TEXT> Greetings! 

I'm currently enrolled at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, and by name, you will notice they specialize in Law and the like. 

They do have a Computer Science program, I believe it isn't the strongest one (on every aspect, tutoring, professors and etc), but what I don't know is if the CS courses offered at the college will prepare me for the jobs in this field. 

Link to the college page about CS: http://www.jjay.cuny.edu/computer-science-and-information-security-bs

Link to info about the courses offered at the school (The computer science course are called "CSCI"): http://johnjay.jjay.cuny.edu/bulletins/undergraduatebulletin20142015.pdf#page=211

Am I good at this school or should I look at other schools to transfer to?

Thanks in advance :)

<TITLE> ASUS has my computer for 2 months already. How should I proceed? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-03 23:32:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello guys. Long time lurker, first time poster.

On Oct 2015 I had to send my computer for service for a series of issues including the display. I got it back, however the Touch Panel of my Notebook wasn't working as expected. I tapped on my display and it invoked a series of ghost touches. I contacted Asus about it and they advised me to disable the touch driver as I didn't want to send the computer for service due to college constraints.

5 months later, the display of the computer stopped working for no reason whatsoever. The computer wasn't dropped, nor liquid was spilled. It just stopped working. I contacted ASUS in regards to this issue and they asked me to send the computer in. That was in March. 

Fast forward to April, I've heard nothing at all from them. I contacted them and I spoke to a manager (whose info I unfortunately don't have) who said my fees in regards to the RMA will be waived as I had this issue "coming" (as per his words) and that I needed to wait more as the parts needed to  fix my notebook aren't on their facilities. 

Fast forwarding to May, I received an email asking me to pay $129 so I can get a replacement for my computer. As instructed by the manager I spoke about, I disputed the repair cost. ASUS says that there are no notes for what the manages said to me, so I have to pay either way. 

I contacted them again today and they still want me to pay and that the computer will be held for longer until I finish disputing this transaction. 

What's the best course of action I can take in this case? If anyone is wondering my computer is a ASUS X550CA

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

<TEXT> This troop is a tanky unit, like the Giant. His attack is over a 100, like the Giant, yet he drops a fucking bomb that does 7x his damage?

True he is easily distracted, but he does 100+ damage. He can kill any troop real quick if the other troop isn't a tank like him and if your opponent has Arrows and Fireballs then consider yourself rekt as the G-Skeleton can get to your tower quicker.

I think the Giant Skeleton offers too much for 6 elixir. But wayyy too much

<DATE> 2016-06-02 01:55:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello guys. Quick facts about my financial situation:

- 18 years 
- Unemployed
-College Student
- Receive about $4k a year
- Monthly expenses are ~$130
- No savings account whatsoever

I currently have a BoA checking's account. Specifically this one: https://www.bankofamerica.com/deposits/checking/personal-checking-account.go

And I also have a Credit Card from them (Limit $600 - 21.24% APR. Lowest they have in BoA at the moment according to them): 
https://www.bankofamerica.com/credit-cards/products/bankamericard-credit-card/

I am not proud of them per say. Way too many issues like not having the ability to add my card to Apple Pay on my phone or Apple Watch or blocking my card when I am making a large purchase right when I am in the line of the store. I've been contemplating switching over to Chase, or CitiBank. I'm leaning towards Chase for both services, Debit and CC.

For the Debit one, I'm leaning towards this account: https://www.chase.com/checking/student-checking
For the Credit one, I'm not too sure, but I think this will do: https://creditcards.chase.com/credit-cards/chase-freedom-unlimited.aspx?CELL=6TKV

**I only use my CC to pay for things that I would otherwise buy with Debit so that I can start building credit.**

If I decide to make the change, how should I proceed? I owe ~$150 on my CC which is due on at the start of July and I am able to pay for. By closing my CC, will that affect my score? How about opening one?

Anything I should watch out for?

Thanks in advance! :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello /r/AskNYC !

Today I passed the written exam for the learner's permit and I'm all set, I can now drive if I have someone over 21 and that has the senior license with them.

However, I've been looking into upgrading my license to the senior's one and I have been told that I need to wait 6 months in order to do so which is where my doubts come in.

On the DMV's office it says: 

" 
**How long do I have to wait after I get my learner permit to take my road test?**

If you are under age 18, you must wait at least 6 months from the date you received your learner permit to schedule your road test. "

I have 18 years old so I don't fit in that category so that means I don't have to wait those 6 months? Or I do have to wait? 

Also, what's a good and cheap school that could teach me how to drive and provide a car for the road test? Preferably one that is in Bronx, NY or in Manhattan

PS: I know I have to drive for at least 50 hours and that has to be signed by my parents or a school I can attend. I have that covered either way </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-05-17 22:01:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I bought two items, one for $13, and another for $32 via Paypal. The tracking number for both items show that they have been delivered, however I didn't get them. I used Pay After Delivery (PAD), so that I have time to check out my items and pay with my credit card (My debit is linked to Paypal) as I don't have enough funds in my debit to pay for both items and if I get charged, my Debit will go to negative.

First seller was a dick about the situation, so he told me to rely in other terms of getting help, he is not helping me. The second seller didn't even replied to my message.

I called USPS for this matter and they didn't help at all. I called the Central and they referred me to my local USPS Office, where I didn't get any help. They are shit and known for not helping out. 

So I contacted Paypal for this issue and they opened a claim, not a dispute. A few hours later, I get two emails saying that I lost the claim as the sellers provided "valid" proof that I "got" my items.

So I appealed those two claims and I got denied. So I once again called and a Paypal representative told me that my card won't be charged, and that I **won't** be charged and that I should see money in my Paypal balance as a compensation for all my trouble.

Today I woke up to two charges from Paypal, the $32 one and the $13 one, making my debit card go negative. I immediately called Paypal and told them what happened and to see the notes from yesterday (when they told me I won't be charged) and they said that won't happen. They basically said, in cute little words those customer representatives tell you, that I'm screwed and that I lost my money and my item and that I should deal with the bank myself. I also asked them what will happen if I file a chargeback and they said nothing will happen. 

**Question:** Am I safe by doing a chargeback? I have 9 hours to decide whether I should do it or no, but I'm scared of future debt collectors or something along those lines. Paypal said I'm screwed, the sellers too, as well as USPS. What should I do?

**TL;DR:** I used Paypal's pay after delivery to buy some items. Items never got to my hands, so USPS said they can't help, sellers won't help me and Paypal said that I "got" my package so they can't do anything. My only option is to do a charge back and my debit card is negative and i have 9 hours to decide what I want to do if I want to avoid any overdraft fees. Should I do a chargeback and just forget about it? Should I do something else?

**EDIT1:** I just finished speaking with my debit card provider and they canceled out the charges, so I won't be facing overdraft fees. 

I also wanted to clarify that I do have the money to pay for my items, the problem is during the 2 weeks Paypal gives me for PAD, I had a erroneous transaction from Apple for $700, which will come to my card in a few days, thus the reason I wanted to pay with my CC in the meantime before they charged my debit card.

Other have suggested that I speak to a manager from Paypal and I am calling them right now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys, little background:

I'm finishing up my first year at college. I took one computer class so far, which is "Intro to CS", where I learned C++. I want to learn Swift in the next couple of months, by myself, so that I can get an internship in the future, knowing more languages. I am a really good learner, but my problem that I'm lazy and I often lose motivation, but if I apply myself to my studies, I can get pretty good grades.. There is nothing else I'm really good at but computers. 

Now my questions:

1-) I stutter. My stutter is from moderate, to severe. Throughout the year my stutter becomes light, but is not that often nor it last for a long period of time. As a Software Engineer, how much talking do you have to do? How is this going to affect my interviews?

2-) I really have no connections to no one. I'm solo on this. Am I going to possibly get far like that? 

3-) How do keep yourself motivated? How do you practice coding at home?

4-) What are the languages I MUST learn in the next 3 years?


Thank you so much in advance :)

<TITLE> [IDEA] Various game modes-- Hardcore, and speed </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-25 15:53:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My idea is the following: 

**Hardcore:** You know when you have placed a bomb tower, or a mortar, if your troops are close to it, they won't get hit? Also, when throwing a fireball to help your troops against minions or whatever, they don't get hit? 

In this mode, I was thinking whatever Splash Damage troops/building do, can affect your own troops. So if a mortar is on your side helping your troops on the other side, they will get affected too. 

In terms of Spell, the same thing can happen. If you throw a Freeze Spell, expect your troops to be Frozen. Or Zapped. Or killed with Fireball/Rocket.

**Speed:** Sometimes I like watching my replays in 4X. They look cool so I thought why don't SC implement a mode where everything is fast paced? Maybe add the 1/2X speed and the 2X speed. Of course, SC could also speed up Elixir, or not. It will be fun regardless.

I'm think this could be like BTD Battles, where you have different Arenas, with different conditions where hardcore could be one of them alongside other ideas/conditions. 

What you guys think? </TEXT>

<TITLE> I plan to learn Swift in 3 months (Summer). What/where I can learn from? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-20 19:17:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> EDIT: I just noticed the tile is confusing. I meant that I wanted to learn Swift in 3 months, as in having 3 months to learn it. I don't need to wait 3 months.


Hey guys! Little background of me. I am majoring in CS and I am almost done with my first year of college. I already know C++, and I don't think my college has a course to learn Swift so I want to learn it in my own. 

I have looked for good apps/websites that could teach me Swift. I have a few  apps downloaded in my iPad, but I don't feel they are complete and I won't get as much information in my 3 months of vacation (Summer). 

Any recommendations of good websites/apps that won't break the bank and that could teach me how to code in Swift and as well as help me design apps for iOS ? I have heard of Design+Code, but I'm not sure if the book will support/teach me about future iterations of iOS and Xcode. I will need to buy the book ($150) and Sketch which costs ($100) and it will suck if iOS 10 brings something new that the book won't teach me.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [C++] I need some help before I hit myself for not figuring it out. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-20 01:06:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys! I'm currently taking a CS class, which is Introduction to Computer Science. In this course we are learning C++. Currently I was given an assignment where I had to: 

 "Write a program that for each of 5 persons has the user  enter name, city, telephone number.    Each of of these should be a string.  In the loop after user enters these, concatenate these with spaces in between to form one string and put the resulting string  into an array of size 5.       Use another loop to output the array ."

I did it with the following code: 

    #include iostream
    #include string

    using namespace std;

    int main ()

    {
    int k = 0, name1=0, name2=0, city=0, tel=0,a=0, b=0;
    int rec[k] = {name1 + name2 + city + tel};
	
	
    while (k++5)
	
    {
    string name1, name2, city, a, b, phone, person;
		
    cout"Enter first name"endl;
    cinname1;

    cout"Enter last name"endl;
    cinname2;
		
    cout"Enter a city"endl;
    cincity;
		
    cout"Enter phone number"endl;
    cinphone;
		
    a="  ";
    b=" ";
    person= rec[k];
    coutpersonendl;
    }
	
    system("pause");
    return 0;
	
    }

However, when I compile this, CMD crashes when running the exe file. I need to test this code so I can do my next assignment which is to: "Modify your "array of strings" assignment to save the data to a file, Use the document at the end of CONTENT  "saving to file".   USE YOUR  NAME FOR FILE NAME, NOT example from class"

Without testing the code above I got this so I can save it to a file, which I believe is wrong too, but here it is: 

 "#include iostream
#include fstream
#include string
using namespace std;

int main () 

{
	int k = 0, name1=0, name2=0, city=0, tel=0,a=0, b=0;
	int rec[k] = {name1 + name2 + city + tel};
	
	
	while (k++5)
	
	{
		string name1, name2, city, a, b, phone, person;
		
		cout"Enter first name"endl;
		cinname1;
		
		cout"Enter last name"endl;
		cinname2;
		
		cout"Enter a city"endl;
		cincity;
		
		cout"Enter phone number"endl;
		cinphone;
		
		a="  ";
		b=" ";
		person= rec[k];
		coutpersonendl;
	}
	



    
    string record = rec[k];
    
    ofstream myfile;
    myfile.open ("EXJRBXNY.txt", ios::app);
    myfilerecordendl;
    myfile.close();
    
    system("pause");
    return 0;
}


Any help is appreciated. Thank you in advance :)

I had my a few win streaks (max 6) before losing one or two matches but the game just flat out turned against me and I lost 20 times already. I don't even change the way I play. What's the most reasonable explanation for this?

<TEXT> Hey guys :)

I'm having a bit of a problem here. I hope that you can help.

Whenever I am using another app like Chrome or playing a game, IE opens automatically with this website http://click.cpvredirect.com/ and then this website redirects me to a random website. Is a different website each time this happens.

I have tried following the steps listed in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXA4i7eEZHw   however that didn't help at all.

I scanned my computer with a free trial of Avast Internet Security, and iObit's Advance System Care 9 and Anitvirus and none of them could detect an issue with my computer. I also tried Avast's Web Toolbar Removal tool but nothing out of the ordinary of what I use comes up. 

How can I get rid of this malware?

Any input is appreciated :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys, can you help me out with this doubt.

I have a light to mild stutter. However, I still get my point across whether is by changing words (while making no sense in terms of 'spoken grammar') or by pointing to things or just by pausing and starting up again. Even with this impediment, I have worked at two places, once in a summer camp, and once as an office assistant in my High School. 

Does my speech impediment and my work history minimizes my chances of landing a job as a Retail Sales Associate or any job at a T-Mo store?

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The game in question is GTA Online, where you have to basically play as your own character online, with 29 other people max with you, in the same city.

Once in a while, I encounter people having this jet: http://gta.wikia.com/wiki/Hydra and basically killing everyone with it, and since the jet is fast, no missile can take it down if the player knows what she/he is doing. And as you might have guessed it, a player killed me with the jet. Multiple times. I got a little frustrated as I am minding my own business so I, with my friend, decide to buy the most expensive car in the game, which costs about $2 million. The reason for such is that if another player destroy your car, they pay 1-2% of what the car costs. So we got in our car (2 cars in total) and waited for the Hydra to come. He killed us about 30 times each or more so enjoy losing more than 1 million dollars a-hole! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know the fact that some setups require us to go back to the Planner room to finish the mission, like Fleeca Job- Scope Out, but I think R* can allow us to leave the Yacht's vehicles on the shore (and probably marked in our radars) so we can finish the mission. 

When the Setup/Finale starts, we can take the Yacht's vehicle to go to the shore where we will be met with our cars. If R* plans to make things hard for us, they could disable access to the Yacht's helicopter so we don't do things fast and easier. 

Anyone else agrees? I especially think this should be a feature exclusively to the Aquarius yacht as this one has 4 seasharks so everyone has a boat for themselves. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello Reddit,

I'm a freshman in college and I am pursuing a CS degree. I started up working towards my major by taking [CSCI 271](http://johnjay.jjay.cuny.edu/bulletins/undergraduatebulletin20142015.pdf#page=211).

Now I'm pretty good at math, computers, solving problems and etc, but my one big problem is that I get distracted. A lot. In class, I end up using my phone more than paying attention to the codes in the board, and I messed up real bad in my first test (I got a 78/100). This, plus a combination of my professor not knowing how to explain in an interactive manner that can help students. Is mostly my fault either way.

Now, I know a few terms of C++, I know where to put them, but I don't know what is their function to the program, or what do they mean. I do my homework too, but I have no idea what the f*** I do in it (although I get a perfect score on them)

Is there a website, guide, where I can see several topics, and get quizzes, lessons and pretty much everything that has to do with C++? 

Right now, we are at "Control Functions (Switch)" March 17. if that helps. Syllabus here: http://imgur.com/jYlCWcw


Thank you so much for your help guys! </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-03-14 17:27:12 </DATE>

<TEXT> Hey guys,

[I made this group three months ago, the post can be found by clicking this sentence](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/3vp3pm/meta_a_modapproved_rjailbreak_telegram_group_chat/)

Since then, we have had good laughs and a nice time helping others out. A bot was even made to simplify our lives. The bot, made by /u/ARX8X , currently checks Pangu and Taig servers for jailbreak release, it check this sub, Twitter, it gets us the ipsw download links and among other thing. Example here: [Image 1](http://i.imgur.com/y2Odgkh.png) , [Image 2](http://i.imgur.com/1Jb39uO.png) , and original comment by the creator: https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/49yd7z/releasepangu_releases_ios91_untether_for_64_bit/d0vuvpb?context=3

However, the admins of the new group made yesterday (which is found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/4aag3r/discussion_telegram_now_has_supergroups_with_up/)), blatantly took /u/ARX8X 's bot without permission, which we believe is a selfish, and bad move. Our conclusion narrows down to the admins as there were no members of the group created first, in the new chat. 

**So what are asking for?** We ask to not support this types of moves and for us, joining in and interacting with the bot, tells us that you are supporting it. We know that you didn't know that before, but now you do. We are okay of having different ways to get quick support, like making a group on Discord, but can we please not steal someone else's work? Hell, I'm not even the creator of the bot and I'm mad about this. Is like taking a developer's tweak and putting it on a pirate repo. The purpose of this community, is to be together, not to harm each other by stealing someone's else work.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm experiencing glitches in GTA lately. I know they are doing server sides fixes/additions as changing the icons to the radio stations, but, they keep breaking another things. 

I got four videos to show you, captured from my PS4 and if I keep experiencing issues, I will post them here. I'm just mad about the first one, and the second one (this one keeps happening to me in my cars, and somebody else's car)

**First one:** [Here is the video](https://youtu.be/NrB16CWrJuI)

I tried to do Piracy Prevention by myself, when this other VIP comes to my yacht, to "invade it". As you can see, he was on "Super-Passive Mode", he had a gun and everything, but he couldn't hit me, nor I could hit him. And as you might have guessed if you didn't watch the video, he got my Yacht, and left in my Helicopter (which was also on "Passive Mode"). What kind of glitch is this?

**Second one:** [Here is the video](https://youtu.be/N6nbKSE_r4w)

This happened on my second character, but I still experience this with my first character. Why the fuck wouldn't the car run? I mean I understand she was jamming to Pop music, but after I turned it off, she still wouldn't accelerate the car. This happens on my firts character on the Osiris and Zentorno where my character will turn on the car, but won't accelerate at all. This annoys me because I have missed many opportunities to chase a bounty down, or escape from the cops/players. What the hell R*?

**Third one:** [This is a graphical glitch/bug, doesn't annoy me, but I will share it nonetheless](https://youtu.be/mYM0RAt-oU8)

This is the second time it happens. The first one I was driving the car and I got into the water and the game puts all of us in the middle of the road with the cops. We didn't swim out of the car or anything like that. We just teleported. 

**Fourth one:** [I think I broke GTAO with this one...](https://youtu.be/cfYmhVSv0HI)

After finishing a Heist Setup, we respawned at the Host's house. When I tried to go out, this happened, and now, all of a sudden the house, becomes my house (it changed style to match my house in Eclipse and everything). Well, at least I know what's behind that door :p

Anyone else seen weird glitches lately? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys!

A little backstory, on August, I lost my green card on the JFK airport. I didn't try hard enough to see if the officials from the airport recovered it, so when I decided to try hard enough it was too late (I'm so stupid, I know **:(** ) I also had my passport expire in the Dominican Republic and renewed it right away, so when I came back from DR, I had two passports, stapled together. USCIS says my Permanent Resident Visa is still valid as long as I have both passports when traveling. 

So in January, I moved/rearranged my whole house in hopes that I can find it, and I didn't and since I was too late to be helped by JFK, I decided to pay the fee to replace. No biggie. I get scheduled to my biometrics appoinment, everything is done. I'm just waiting for the card to arrive and it will take 9 months at most to get it back. 

Now, I wanted to apply for my Learner Permit, and tried to apply with my passport, however, since my Visa stamp is on the old passport, my application was automatically declined as I need it on my new passport. I do really want to apply to get my permit and "upgrade" to the senior license as it will open many opportunities to apply to more jobs, like being a valet. What should I do in this case? I was told by the DMV office that I could go to the USCIS office to get my new passport stamped but I looked online and I don't find anything helpful. What should I do? What offices in NYC can I visit to get help? 

Just a note, I'm 17, 18 in a month. I don't know if that matters, but I'm trying to give as much allowed info I can in order to get help.

Thank you guys in advance :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would add a tool that would allow players to create Contact Missions and Heists, so that R* reviews them and puts them in the game (decreasing their effort in creating Missions).

I wouldn't delete anything actually. I would change the LSPD system. They are annoying. Maybe R* could decrease their way of going at the player?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **EDIT: This post was downvoted, as well as my comment before people misinterpreted the point of the post. My point wasn't to talk about the Kuruma and how "I abuse of it" as I was accused for by other people in this sub. I don't the Kuruma a lot, but I just use it where I see that it is necessary. In this situations a low level invites me to a Heist, I go without armored car to see how they perform. If they suck, I get out of the Heist, let them invite me again and use the Kuruma to help out, but they still don't follow instructions nor advices like doing things **outside** the car like going to an objective or taking a shortcut. I'm not trying to be a little bitchy ass boss, but I'm just trying to help out so they don't die and do the mission. Several people here turned against the post because I use the Kuruma without seeing why I use it. So before commenting see why I use the Kuruma in the situation below. This also goes to /u/majoroutage , /u/Skellicious , /u/Solaratov , /u/IggyWon , and /u/_Woodrow_ 
This is just how I play, helping others out and thinking about them so we can progress forward, if you maybe see how I play (or play with the people I described below), I'm sure you will change your mindset.**


I can't believe I could be the only one matched with complete fucktards on the game. I know you are a low level, I realize that and know what you feel as I have been there but God damn, can you follow instructions/advices at least? This shit don't make sense. This is going to be a long read. Here is my experience:

**The Flecca Job**

This should be the easiest one right? Eh, no. I can't believe how people fail this one. Heck, even me being a low level and doing it for the first time knew what to do and thought with my brain.

*Flecca Job - Kuruma*

The easiest way I like to do this is to take my Kuruma and kill the gang guarding the Kuruma we need to take. When we get out of the Host's apartment, I tell them to get in my Kuruma, because we can kill the gang faster, and I also say and repeat, to stay in my car until all of them are dead. **They still get out of my Kuruma to kill the gang and they end up dying, at least twice. WTF? Is it hard to understand it?**

*Flecca Job Finale* 

After drilling the safe (or whatever that is called), we are supposed to get on the car. **Why the fuck do you get out of the banks, to kill the cops? Just why? Lester told you at least twice the car is armored. Tf?**

**The Prison Break**

*Plane*

**"Um, don't get out my Kuruma until all of the Vagos, well, the enemies are gone okay guys?" *Everyone gets on my Kuruma* "All right, here we go, don't get out of my car and shoot from the inside" *Everyone gets off my car and dies the second they try to get to cover* -_-*

*Bus*

**"Guys, I got the bus, go to the dirt and don't follow me so we lose the cops faster" *Oh sure, that's the first thing we going to do* "Get away from me" *Psych, we like you, let's make this harder and lose the cops together while I keep shooting at them* -___-**

*Prison Break- Finale*

I also don't have complaints, unless the Prisioner doesn't listen to me when I tell him to get to cover or the Demolition destroys Helis and cars near the Plane on Sandy Shores.

**The Humane Labs Raid**

*Valkeryie*

Oh damn, this one is just plain stupid to do. Hope in a Kuruma and go all the way to the Heli itself. Kill the people around the Heli inside the Kuruma and get out of there with the Heli. Yep, that's the way to do it. Unless, another player do the stuff their way, which, ends up in them being dead. At least twice until the player realizes getting on the Kuruma is the way to go. 

*Deliver EMP*

Agent 14 tells you to kill them silently, heck, he even tells you he gave you weapons with silencer. Why the fuck do you take out a RPG, or an Assault Riffle without silencer? What the hell?


**Series A**

*Bikers*

Same thing as *Deliver EMP* why the fuck you use something without silencer when the game tells you to not alert them?

**Pac Standard**

*Vans*

I'm always the Navigator. I know where the Vans are and if I get confused, I use the Tracking app. One of the driver honks at me to get on their car so I tell them via voice, that I can go and do it, but I will need the driver to just drive around and not crash any vans. Well, that can't work out as the driver will crash into me when i'm taking the picture of the van's plate, or he will shoot at the other driver and crash into everything, making the mission fail. If we ever get the van we need, the other players keep following me. TF?

*Hack*

I always like to go ahead and kill the rival crew the others come to decrease our chances of dying. Well, I tell these people not to follow me and yet they do so no one goes and get the vans, making us lose time and a few tries along with it as they die trying to get on my car (I set my car access to No-one once in a while).

*Convoy*

This one is easy, if you are patient that is. The first thing I say is not to take the truck and drive it away, as it will make the mission more difficult by having enemies on foot and car and the Heli. If we wait, we can knock out everything without being too pressured by the enemies. And guess what people do, the opposite of what I say/planned. Great.

*Bikes*

Same as always: **"Get on my Kuruma and knock this out." *Nope, I'm going on my car and die* Really?**

*Finale*

First thing people can't do right is the simplest thing ever. Crowd Control. In every finale I do for randoms, the NOOSE gets called, making things harder and the Host didn't put the Heist so that we can use our Player Saved Outfit. I tell the Hacker or Demo (depending on which role I'm doing, either Demo or Hacker) and tell them to stay on the bank while I go to the bikes, but, Mr. Super Man don't listen. Well, either way, I open the way to the bikes, almost dying, but IDC. When we are at the bikes, I repeat like 5 times to not get on the bike and follow me (describing my character as it stands out from the others who wear the same thing). Well, all of them left on the bike and wait for me on the entrance of where the bikes were. I try to get them out of the bike by holding triangle and quickly destorying the bike, but the others see what I did and decide to play with me. Cool. We almost lose a million dollars in there until we get the Kuruma. Now on the way to the canyon on the Kuruma, the players jump out of the car, when I say the opposite. Losing more money as the host goes downhill without his parachute. 


This is my personal story with Heist. I think I'm cursed with randoms. What is the experience you guys have with randoms?

TL;DR: People being stupid and being jackasses on Heist and missions. What's your story?

<TEXT> Hello there!

This is my first time posting here, so if I didn't do something right, let me know please :)

Up for sale is an Asus Notebook bought on November 2014 but it wasn't used as much in the house and I'm looking to get a Mac for college. 

The only problem/defect of the laptop is that the plastic is broken at the top left of the keyboard/base. I might not described it correctly in words, so I will leave this album here to explain the issue better: http://imgur.com/a/5RjYP

Other than that, it is in a great condition, no flaws on the screen, nothing abnormal. 

This laptop packs the following: 

**3rd Gen Intel Core i3-3217U processor (With 3MB L3 Cache and 1.8 GHz processor speed and it also features smart 4-way processing performance for HD quality computing. 
Intel HD graphics provide extra graphics power for the laptop when needed); 4GB DDR3 Memory (expandable to 6GB oficially, but people have this same Notebook with 8GB with no issues); 15.6" display, 500GB of hard drive (Actually two separate drives adding up to 500GB, one 250GB and the other, well, 250GB too. Both drives have 5400 rpm); Intel HD Graphics 4000, 1.0MP webcam, digital media reader (I haven't tested this to see if it works); 1 USB 3.0 port and 2 2.0 ports; 802.11n Wi-Fi and 10/100/1000 Mpbs Ethernet (RJ-45) connector)**

That was a wall of text :( But every thing I could say about the note book is in there. A better way to see the features/specs are here, on ASUS' website: https://www.asus.com/Notebooks/X550CA/specifications/

The laptop is on Windows 10 64-bit, but I could go to W8 or W8.1 when requested :) 

Also, depending on the buyer, I might give you access to Office 365 (one of the activation codes my school provides) and McAfee (my cable router provides this). The reason I say might, is that both software reveals my name and email address so when you purchase, I will need to see your history here on the sub to trust you with both, my name and email. 

Moving on! TIMESTAMPS: http://imgur.com/a/USfFZ      I just have two pics, and if you need more let me know and they will be uploaded ASAP. 

My asking price is $370 + shipping. 
.
Any questions please let me know :)

<TEXT> The game in question is GTA Online, where you have to basically play as your own character online, with 29 other people max with you, in the same city. 

Once in a while, I encounter people having this jet: http://gta.wikia.com/wiki/Hydra and basically killing everyone with it, and since the jet is fast, no missile can take it down if the player knows what she/he is doing. And as you might have guessed it, a player killed me with the jet. Multiple times. I got a little frustrated as I am minding my own business so I, with my friend, decide to buy the most expensive car in the game, which costs about $2 million. The reason for such is that if another player destroy your car, they pay 1-2% of what the car costs. So we got in our car (2 cars in total) and waited for the Hydra to come. He killed us about 30 times each or more so enjoy losing more than 1 million dollars a-hole! </TEXT>

I wan to know the name of the law that has the following effect on minors:

The law require people under 18 to have a person over 18 to sign for a legal document, like School sports permission, electronic device repairs/replacement, medical form and among other things Apple. The reason I ask is because Apple has given me replacement for my Apple Watch and iPhone without having someone with me to sign the document, but when I wanted a replacement for my iPad, they wouldn't let me sign it unless I have someone over 18 with me.  </TEXT>

Hey guys! I just want to know if this is a scam or not. Any help/inout is appreciated. I posted a listing of my laptop on NY Craigslist. Shortly after, I received a text, from a NY phone, asking for the condition of the computer. I answered their text, and the "buyer" proceeded to ask where I was located, question which I answered (I just said city and state). The buyer then asks me if I can take $130 more than I asked for so i can ship it to Miami. I proceeded to ask why he/she is offering more, and he told me is for shipping purposes so I can send it to Miami. He/she stated that the computer will be sent outside of the country for his "friend" after he receives it. Anyways, the buyer proceeded to ask if I can request the money to his paypal, which seems strange to me, so I stopped answering. Is this a scam? If I request money, Paypal won't have my back so I'm having second thoughts about all of this. I reversed search the phone number and nothing comes up, neither something appears for the Paypal email provided. Should I keep ignoring the texts? Or this is safe? I can provide screenshots if requested via PM so I don't break the rules. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello Redditors!

I bought a yacht about two days ago, and the initial location was in the East side of "Terminal/Bucanner Way". Shortly after I get on it, I decided to move it to Vespucci Beach, paying the $25k fee. After a Heist/switching session/closing the game and opening it again, the Yacht goes back to the Terminal or to the East of LSIA, which means I have to pay the $25k fee in order to move it to Vespucci again.

Anyway I can stop my Yacht from moving? I hate paying $25k just because my Yacht wants to move on its own. Thanks for your help! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Was the Pac Standard Glitch fixed? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-28 16:44:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Sorry if this isn't the right place to post this.

I believe the glitch doesn't work anymore as the game detected the Host (one of my friends) left the game/Heist so I want to confirm it. We tried twice already and I don't know if we did something wrong, or is patched already. 

Here is how the game went:

Host was Demolition, I was Hacker, and two random guys were Crowd Control. I carried all the money, so I stayed in the bank while the "runners" went to the bike and destroy it so the checkpoint is set where the bikes are. Everything was successful (with a couple of tries). After we spawned, bikes were destroyed again, as I had a Kuruma in the apartment right behind where the bikes are. So, we destroyed it, we took the Kuruma and we got to the place where the Dinghy is. Afterwards, I made sure the Host was last to enter (as the random guys took a long time to get on the boat.... I think they don't read directions) and it happened. I was driving the Dinghy and as soon as the front of the boat passed the bridge, the Host closed the game and the glitch seemed to work as the minimap and the destination circle disappear so I stopped driving. **However**, the minimap appeared as well as the destination circle and we got the message that the Host/Demolition Team left. 

Was the glitch patched? There was no update at all so we thought the glitch still worked (before the new Sultan update that came out today). Can someone please confirm if it was patched or not? We are on PS4. 

Thanks in advance! 

TL;DR: Friend and I did the Pac Standard Heist, and my friend was the Host. The purpose was to do the glitch. The game detected that the Host left the game twice already and we made sure the Host was last to get on the boat. Host closed the game as soon as the front of the boat passed the bridge. Is glitched still working? </TEXT>

<TITLE> [PSA] Many GTA players know this, but if you don't, you can get a free car, specifically the Elegy RH8. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-27 17:44:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys! Just a tip for the beginners of the game (or for those who didn't know this). You can get a Elegy RH8 for free. Here is the car's info: http://www.ign.com/wikis/gta-5/Annis_Elegy_RH8

In order to get this car for free, you will need two things (or one, or none, depending if you have the materials):

- A garage or a house
- Have your Steam, PSN, or Xbox Gamertag connected to Rockstar's Social Club

If you are new to the game, here is a list of properties you can have. I recommend aiming for a high-end house (apartment) so you can do your Heists: http://www.ign.com/wikis/gta-5/Properties_(GTA_Online)

If you got your house (or garage), then connect your gamertag with Rockstar's Social Club here: http://socialclub.rockstargames.com/

If you got those things, then go to the Internet on your player's phone (or computer in the Heist planning room) and click on "Travel and Transport" and click on the third link. Then go to the red bar under the yellow car and hit it once. Afterwards, you will see the Elegy RH8 and it should be **free**. If it is not, wait a few minutes. Choose your color, and get it

<TEXT> Hello guys!

I've been invited to the Poconos and we will be going by Christmas time. I was there 2 (or 3) years ago and I remember service on an iPhone 5 sucked in there. No roaming, nothing at all. Only AT T, Sprint (and I think also Verizon worked, I don't remember) worked and their MVNOs. 

Does T-Mobile works there now? Is it only band 12 phones that work there? I will be going with my brother who has an iPhone 6 on MetroPCS so I want to know if I will be the only one to have a signal on my iPhone 6S (T-Mobile) or not. 

If it helps:

Device: iPhone 6S
Plan: Simple Choice 2 lines for $100


Thanks in advance!

<TEXT> Hey guys, I hope you guys help me on this issue as I will be visitibg Gamestop often.

2 weeks ago, I went to the store and got myself a PS4 BO3 bundle. I didn't have my card on me, but lucklily, my info popped up on the computer. The employee didn't offer me a "Pro" reward card, so I didn't even ask for it as I wasn't thinking about that anyways. 

A few days later, I kept saying people got items using their points, so I wondered how many points I had and I was this close to getting the points I needed to get something that I liked: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B1NFMTTCYAMkSOX.jpg
so I decided to buy some more games, remotes, etc for my PS4. 

So today, I went to trade in some games and remote with my 18-years old cousin (as I can't trade them due to age). At the end, the employee helping me offered me a "Pro" Rewards Card and explained me the benefits of it (how it will help with the trade, etc,etc) so I used the credit to upgrade my Basic card. Everything worked as expected, I got 10% more on my trades, and I got out of the store. When I got home, I tried activating the card from Safari on my iPhone, it said: **"Sorry, we couldn't validate your information. Please try again."** so I thought it was a problem with the browser so I went to the Gamestop app, and it sent me to Safari so I switched to my laptop where I tried again and the same message appeared. Now my card isn't active, now I can't see my points, and I basically have an extra "useless" card on my wallet. What should I do now? Sorry for the long post :/

**TL;DR: I upgraded my Basic card and now I can't activate the Pro card for some reason. What should I do?**

<TITLE> Upgraded from the fat PS3 made in 2007, here is what I think. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I got my BO3 PS4 bundle 2 weeks ago, and here is what I think about the PS4 at this point after upgrading from my fat 60GB PS3. Worth to mention that I have the latest PS4 revision (the one with mechanical buttons)

*CONS:**

* I still can't save 2 Wi-Fi networks :( I saw that many people requested it on their forums (and pretty much anywhere else) and Sony didn't bring that feature to the PS4. I 'm still positive that future SW updates will bring this feature. I see myself playing online with my iPhone's Hostpot, then switching to the public Wi-Fi (I'm paying for subscription) near my house so I can download things/keep the PS4 connected to the internet and is annoying setting up both networks again and again.

* **This sounds like an issue I only had. I fixed it by factory resetting the system. Special thanks to /u/Matt4045, /u/supabloo , /u/workworkwork1234 for their insight in this issue so I could get it fixed.** ~~The PS Dynamic home screen lags while an application is **running** (it doesn't when no application is running). I've tried switching to a static theme, but nothing helps. The PS3 I had could go into the XMB just fine, without lagging. If I want to change a song on Spotify while playing BO3, I have to wait like 15-ish seconds so the UI can be fluid and then changes to the next screen, where I have to wait more so the animations complete. (I know I can do it from my phone, but sometimes my phone is unavailable for me to use to change songs) I was told to rebuild database, however, that helps, for some time, then the lag comes back.~~ 

* The DS4....... Sony, couldn't you put more battery to the DS4? I played longer on my DS3 but I see myself charging the DS4 at least once a day and I hate being tethered to the console. 

**PROS:**

* This thing is silent, I don't hear anything from it at all. My PS3 will make so much sound, it would affect my mom's sleep at night and she will tell me to turn it off. She doesn't even notice my PS4 at all (unless I forget to lower the speaker sound and I get a call (or make one) in GTA V, or the lady in BO3 tells me my scorestreak is ready)

* Performance in games is super duper great. I enjoy using my console even more due to the graphics and things that I wish I could do with the PS3. The PS4 really exceeded my expectations.

* The DS4 is a huge improvement over the DS3. In the DS3, I could feel/see the latency between pressing my buttons and my character on the screen but I can't see it here on the DS4/PS4. 

**Things I wish I could do/ Things I want**

These are not hardware wise, but I wish I could:

* Delete some apps from my home screen. I don't use 40% of them so I wish I could hide them in "Library". I feel this will help reduce lag.

* Re-organize the menu on the "Notification" screen. I mostly go there to check download and that's pretty much it.

* Re-organize the PS menu (where you hold the PS button on the remote).

* Lower the volume of the system/remote when I have it connected to my headphone via the headphone's volume control.

* I wish the Playstation Store was a standalone application and not a "internet browser bookmark** (At least how I feel it/see it)

* I wish I could install my Blu-Ray games on my PS4, and that the system asks for it every 3 days or so to verify that I still have it. I don't see the point of having 48GBs of Black Ops 3 in my hard drive if I still need the disc to play it **Quick question about this: why does BO3 takes so much space as it was downloaded from PS-Store?**

* I wish I could activate 2 systems per account like the PS3


**Summary-- TL;DR**

I'm pretty much happy with the change. Sony could improve somethings via SW updates, so I can't wait to see what Sony brings us in future updates. Via SW updates, Sony can also fix several annoyances people have with the PS4. The PS4 is definitely better than the PS3. If you got the latest model of the PS3, I still recommend to upgrade anyways, it is worth it. I chose this long to upgrade my system as I was waiting to see what manufacturer problems the PS4 can bring, and at this point, there isn't pretty much any problems. 

**If I said anything that could be easily fixed, please let me know. Thanks in advance :)** </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello guys, 

I'm writing a research paper in which I talk about stuttering. The whole paper is good, however, the solution I proposed wasn't well accepted by my professor. 

In my paper, I put that raising awareness could help us (at least how I see it), so I have to look for something that's not about raising awareness. What solutions do you guys have/had in mind for stutter that I could talk about? 

Here is the link to my first draft: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GAhmBl40WN4nQ-jzG17bO-G2_3cCBGpSFLZrqmCjP0Q

I will of course, share my final draft with you guys :) </TEXT>

<TITLE> [META] A mod-approved /r/jailbreak Telegram group chat </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-06 21:06:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **Is worth to mention that this is not an official chat from the moderators, I am working on the chat independently. I just did it so you guys have quick support. A message from a moderator: /u/ibbignerd "To make this very clear, this is an independent project and has nothing to do officially with /r/jailbreak or the moderation team. While we support users coming up with new projects, this is different from being officially supported."** 

Hello guys, I messaged the mods of this sub asking if they could do a Telegram group chat, and their response was that I could do it so let's see how this will work out :)

Joining is easy, and here are the steps:

1) Download the Telegram app || [LINK](http://telegram.org)

2) Register your account using your phone number (You can sign up using a Google Voice number if you want)

**NOTE:** If you do not want anyone else to see your phone number, don't add them as a contact. Only your personal contacts in Telegram can see your phone number.

**3) If you would like to remain anonymous, do not put your real name in when it asks you for your name. Whatever you put in this field is what everyone else in the chat room will see. Put your Reddit username or something along those lines so you remain anonymous.**

4) After you're done setting up your account, go to Settings and register a "Public Username." This will associate a username with your account that can be searchable by others. Your username will then be what you have chosen and it will be after the @ symbol (just like Instagram)

5) Finally, to join the chat, click this link: telegram.com/rjailbreak

6) Change your notification settings for the group. As the chat grows, it could create chaos in your device.

I hope you guys like this and if I don't see positive feelings towards the chat, I will delete as it will be sort of like unnecessary then. The same rules will apply, but we can work it out as the chat grows :)

Cheers!

We are a supergroup btw :)

<TITLE> [Discussion] Please don't fall for these fake jailbreaks.. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-05 21:00:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I saw a thread just now (but I can't find it now so I could link you guys to it), that said that the OP lost his iOS 9.0.x jailbreak for a 9.1 and 9.2 jailbreak. Just so you know, if you see a jailbreak for 9.1 or 9.2 is fake. If you still doubt it see the sidebar - [Sidebar](http://imgur.com/gStYGSq) just in case.

I believe these people do these fake jailbreak because they can advertise via these methods and get money. Or a Youtuber can promote it on his channel so he/she gets views (which equals to money if they monetize their video). Jailbreak is free in every way (unless a Youtuber posts a tutorial of it), just remember that

Remember to follow closely each jailbreak team on their website or Twitter so you get reliable info and a good jailbreak:

**Pangu**: [Website](http://pangu.io) || [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PanguTeam) || **Note: Pangu's website domain is "io" not "net" so don't fall for this one (which is fake by the way) [Fake one, "net" domain"](http://pangu9.net/)**

**Taig**: [Website](http://www.taig.com/en/) || [Twitter](https://twitter.com/taig_jailbreak)

**Last thing, if the sub isn't talking about that jailbreak then is fake. Period*

I recommend turning on Push Notification for those two accounts so you know when they are about to release a jailbreak or something along those  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have seen myself in the situation where i wanted to start from scratch on my jailbreak. I didn't try Impactor as you guys have said that it doesn't work so I tried an alternative that should be done via my phone. 

If you uninstall **Cydia Substrate**, all your tweaks and libraries will be uninstalled too at the same time. So I went ahead and did that and now I have a "fresh jailbroken" iPhone 6S. 

If you get an error like in this thread: https://redd.it/3r53k0
Fix it following this steps: https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/3r53k0/help_i_accidentally_unistalled_substrate_and_all/cwkyqhd

 "Fixed it!
I tried following /u/jayreddin 's advice, to close Cydia from the task switcher and I opened it again. I saw as an opportunity to install Substrate again (without respringing from the previous unistall). I resprung and everything is good again.
Thank you /u/jayreddin" 

Hope I helped in any way! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I live in NYC and I have applied for almost all the Chipotle in Manhattan. Some of them just flat out send me an email rejecting my application. Some of them say to go for an interview, they see me, and they say that they are going to call me or email me in regards to their desicion. One day later, my application is rejected.

The only time that I have felt that I would get the job is when I applied to the 8th Ave and 52nd Street Chipotle. I went for an interview three times. Thee third one was to see the back of the restaurant and how things work. Afterwards, I was told that I would receive a call in 24hrs. I didn't so I waited another day before I called. I called and they put me in hold then the manager told me that I was rejected. No reason given and hanged up.

 I don't apply in the Bronx (another  because they are full already and I don't apply on Queens nor Brooklyn because they are far away from where I live (Bronx).

Should I keep applying to the same stores or should I just give up? </TEXT>

<TITLE> John "roasted" Sprint following their cut in Twitter </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-18 20:47:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is what he said: 
"This may be a surprise to some, but I love @sprints new err rinse-and-repeat promotion announced this morning! Why do I love it? Marcelo repeatedly said there are no gimmicks, but lets look at the fine print shall we? They added @TMobile to their cut your bill in half promotion, and heres the great news - it applies to almost 0% of @TMobile customers! "

Then he followed to list ten things in which T-Mo is better than Sprint:

"10. @TMobile customers get Unlimited video streaming w/ their plans. Not on @Sprint. #SprintCountdown #halfoffthetruth

9. @TMobile customers get Unlimited music streaming w/ their plans. Not on @Sprint. #SprintCountdown #halfoffthetruth

8. @TMobile customers get #DataStash (unused data rolls forward). Not on @Sprint. #SprintCountdown #halfoffthetruth

7. @TMobile customers get tethering included in their plans. Not on @Sprint's new 50% off offer. #SprintCountdown #halfoffthetruth

6. @TMobile customers use their phone in Mexico   Canada just like they do in the US. Not on @Sprint. #SprintCountdown #halfoffthetruth

5. @TMobile customers get unlimited data and text in 140 countries. Not on @Sprint. #SprintCountdown #halfoffthetruth

4. @TMobile customers don't have activation fees. @sprint charges $36 per line! #SprintCountdown #halfoffthetruth

3. @TMobile customers get America's Fastest 4G LTE network. @Sprint's get America's slowest (@Ookla). #SprintCountdown #halfoffthetruth

2. @TMobile customers get 4G LTE in 500+ cities. Not on @Sprint. #Spark...I mean #LTEplus #SprintCountdown #halfoffthetruth

1. @TMobile customers get access to whatever plan they want. On @sprint, you have to leave and come back take advantage! #SprintCountdown"

TL;DR: John roasted Sprint on Twitter. That's all you need to know :p

<TEXT> If you have an Apple Watch, you would know that when the screen is locked, the phone stays "chill" (the screen doesn't light up, nothing) when a notification comes in, while the watch tells you. 

If you turn off Bluetooth, the phone will alert you (since the Watch can't) or when you take off your Watch, the phone will alert you. 

The tweak that I am requesting makes the watch alert you of the notification as well as the phone while the phone is locked.

There is a tweak already that does this feature, but it is when the phone is unlocked. When the phone is unlocked, the watch doesn't alert you of the notification but the phone does.

TL;DR: A tweak that will make the phone light up when a notification comes in on while its locked and paired with an Apple Watch </TEXT>

<TEXT> All right, so I signed for T-Mobile because I thought that the unlimited data will help me for college (and it does, but the only downside is that there is no service in some areas of the campus). I got the 2 unlimited lines for $100 (I'm with my mom on the line).

Later on, I discovered that my college gives discounts, so I signed up for that, and I got approved for it. That was two bill statements ago (2 months). The next month came in super low so I thought the discount was in effect, and I thought that could save me economically. However, this bill statement came in higher than usual ($189) since I got an iPhone 6S on JOD ($26/month) but that didn't add up to the amount I owed last month ($127). I was expecting my bill to come in at $153 with my discount, and that didn't happen as you can see. 

I contacted T-Force on Twitter and i get told the following:

And I quote; "I do see that there is a corporate indicator on the account. However, the rate plan that you are in is one of our already discounted promotional rate plans that the monthly discounts do not apply to. *TripR" 

Is there a specific requirements to get discounts? If I knew this would happen, I wouldn't have bought the iPhone 6S, and instead I would have fixed my water damaged iPhone 6. Should I contact somebody else rather than T-Force (611 maybe?)

TL;DR: Signed up for 2 unlimited lines for $100, I applied for discount and I got approved. Now I have been told by T-Force that the discount doesn't apply on my line. What gives? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello /r/hardwareswap !

Looking forward to my first sale here!

I have a Guitar Hero Live that I don't want anymore (I sucked at it lol) so I want to sell it to someone who will make good use of it. It is on perfect condition, zero scratches, nothing. It has new batteries (Double AA).

I live in NYC and I can ship it (if you pay for it, I will have to pay too much for it as the neck of the guitar can't be removed so it can't be placed on the box) or we can meet up. Looking to sell it for $85. Any questions let me know!

<TITLE> [Tutorial][Discussion] Tweaks that will help you in case your phone gets stolen or you lose it. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-04 18:53:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello /r/jailbreak!

So I wrote this tutorial to help you out in case your phone is lost or gets stolen. I believe this will help you get your device back and it will be hard for someone to turn it off thus leaving your phone "untrackable" via Find My iPhone. 

Please visit this link as I will show you pictures of I how I have things set up here: 

http://imgur.com/a/u45fH

The tweaks I will use for this tutorial are **BioProtect,** (BioLockDown will do fine if you use that) **Polus, IfFound2** (it works good on iOS 9) **and iGotYa.** (Image 1 from the Imgur link located above)

So let's jump into the steps:

1-) Install the tweaks I mentioned above.

2-) Turn on Find My iPhone (if it is off) and turn on the last option (Image 2). This will help you a lot tracking your device you will know where it will be when the phone turns off due to battery. The option can be found in iCloud - Find My iPhone.

* 2A-) There is also an app that is like Find My iPhone and is better (although I recommend keeping Find My iPhone on as it will enable Activation Lock). The app was brought to my attention by /u/_SarahB_ . The app is called Cylay and it can be found on the ModMyi repo. The app features:

* sounding unstoppable alarms
* sending messages to your phone
* fake shutdown mode
* Take a picture front/rear cam
* Taking Screenshots from the website cylay.com
* Call history
* Erase ALL data
* reboot/shutdown
* LIVE streaming front/rear cam or audio alone

and more! I will definitely keep it. 

3-) Now let's setup **BioProtect** (or BioLockDown if you use that). With this tweak you can block access to apps with your fingerprint. The tweak also blocks someone from turning off the phone without a registered fingerprint so go ahead and turn that on (Image 3). The option is in **Settings - BioProtect - Power Off Protection** Now the device can't be turn off without your finger.

4-) Now let's setup **Polus**. I believe this is an important piece because anyone can make the device "untrackable" by turning on Airplane Mode, so let's avoid that. So I will go to **Settings - Polus - Top Shelf**. If you take a look at Image 4, I blocked access to Airplane Mode, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth (I did that so I can keep my watch connected and ring it from there just in case) and DND (this is also important) in the lockscreen. I had the option to disable the flipswitch or to hide it so I chose to hide it and it looks like this (Image 5). After unlocking the device, the switches will appear again.

5-) Now let's talk about **IfFound 2** (Image 6). As I said, this works on iOS 9 but you have to get it from another repo since the BigBoss one will not let you download it yet. This will put your info in the lockscreen so whoever has your phone can call a number you set so the device can go into your hands again.  Take a look at Image 7, it will talk by itself.

6-) The tweak I will talk about in this step is **iGotYa**. This tweak will help you identify whoever has your phone and the location of the phone. As you can see on Image 8, I have it set it up so the tweak sends me an email with the photo (taken from the front face camera) and the location of the phone. Apart from the email iGotYa sends, iGotYa also sends a SMS from your number to the number of your choice with the location of your phone. I recommend putting your iCloud email (if you don't use it as much) and turn off notifications for the email so the person wouldn't know the device is taking pictures of him/her.

7-) I want to add one more tweak that I will be using in combination with the other ones. I didn't about this tweak until it was presented to me by /u/lanouille974. This tweak is called PickPocket by our moderator /u/Ziph0n . The tweak will make your device activate a sound that will ring endlessly if the passcode is entered incorrectly. This also works for TouchID. It will also make the device ring endlessly if some tries to turn it off (a passcode is required to turn off the device, the password can be edited from PickPocket's settings). To stop it the sound, simply unlock your device. Please note that this is in an alpha state, but I believe this tweak is almost ready for a full release. The tweak can be found at http://repo.ziph0n.com/    Nice work on this one /u/Ziph0n !

I hope this tutorial helps you and if you have question or suggestions, don't hesistate to leave a comment. I take positive and negative feedbacks ;)

Also, if you take this tutorial and use it in your website, please **CREDIT ME**. Thank you! </TEXT>

So I want to know if you guys know anyone who has done research and has a website where I could get his/her findings? 

Thanks in advance, I just don't know where to look. I've tried 'Googling' but I didn't get anything. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Just wanted to let you guys know, Apple will fix/replace your screen if and only if... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-01 05:26:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys, just wanted to let you guys know that Apple will change your screen for free if you meet the following conditions:

1. Your screen has only one harline crack. ONLY ONE. Maybe they will take two (if connected). If you have more than one try your luck.
2. The iDevice you have does NOT have a POINT OF IMPACT. Meaning, if it has a dent, Apple will know you dropped it and this will be counted as an accidental damage and you have to pay. 
3. You are still on warranty. This is important. If you are out of warranty you have to pay. 

My friend had his iPhone 6 screen replaced because he had a hairline crack. I went with him to the store and the repair was under my name (the device is my friend's but the repair was under my account) and everything was free. They took two hours to replace it though but it was worth it. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello jailbreakers,

I have a little issue. Siri is triggering herself when I press the home button to wake my iPhone 6S. I'm sure this happened after jailbreaking the phone. I'm sure she is not being triggered by someone saying "Hey Siri" because there is different behaviors when she starts depending on how you invoke her. I previously installed VirtualHome and I had the action to put my finger on the sensor for a short time to trigger her but I got rid of VirtualHome and it keeps happening. What should I do? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I have always been scared of losing my phone or have it stolen. Things happen so I want to be ready for it. I already have tweaks for my iPhone 6S that will make it hard for a thief (or person who finds my phone) to make my device offline (so I can track it and get it back), like BioProtect, Polus, and etc. 

However, there is an effective solution to make my device unusuable, and that is ejecting my SIM card. So I want to know if Activator could make the phone connect to a specific Wi-Fi network  so it is still online on FMI. Is this possible? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As Karen stated here: https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/3owd3h/discussion_stability_of_pangus_ios_90x_untether/  your device could get the "BLoD" when you reboot it, so if you are jailbroken, try to avoid tweaks that makes you reboot. Also try to avoid "soft resetting" your device (Home+Power) until all of this is sorted out.

As far as I know, *Winterboard* forces to Reboot in order to complete its install. Any more tweaks you guys know about that forces you to reboot when installing or changing its setting? 

When I find more tweaks I will edit the post (or comment on the post) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Possible way to downgrade AW as told by an Apple Rep. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-10-05 00:52:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I sent my iOS 9 iPhone for service and I got an iOS 8.3 one as a return, so I jailbroke it and my watch was on Watch OS 2. So I figured that I could talk to Apple so they can downgrade my watch (as I have read here and other websites). The chat rep I talked to, wouldn't let me send my watch for service so what he said is that to downgrade I should have a backup of Watch OS 1, which will downgrade the watch when I restore the backup.

Would that work? I know it doesn't work on iDevices (as the backup will restore on the version you are in, it won't downgrade it) but in the AW could be different. Could somebody try this? 

PS: I can't try it, I don't have a Watch OS 1 backup, and my Watch is now taking dust (I won't give up jailbreak, I rely on it)

Is there any other way to downgrade the watch? </TEXT>
