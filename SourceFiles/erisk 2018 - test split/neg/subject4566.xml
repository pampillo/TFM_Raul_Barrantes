<TEXT> This comment is about the competence of a leader during an emergency, and how it would be more reassuring to have a qualified agency head rather than a person known for both wanting to eliminate the Energy Department and for forgetting which department he wanted to eliminate, coasting by on the work of experts from previous administrations. The only reassurance is that some of those experts are still in the department, but there are 21 unfilled key appointments at the Department of Energy. Other agencies are even worse equipped. There are 43 unfilled positions at the Department of Defense. We are vulnerable, as a country, to emergencies when our government is a skeleton crew led by unqualified people. This is dangerous. </TEXT>

Edit: To respond to the downvotes, here's an example:

[NIH: Androgen insensitivity syndrome:](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/androgen-insensitivity-syndrome)

Androgen insensitivity syndrome is a condition that affects sexual development before birth and during puberty. People with this condition are genetically male, with one X chromosome and one Y chromosome in each cell. Because their bodies are unable to respond to certain male sex hormones (called androgens), they may have mostly female external sex characteristics or signs of both male and female sexual development. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Macron already has more votes than Le Pen. At most one could say that by abstaining you are increasing Macron's chances.

Only if your natural alliance is with Le Pen. Voting for Macron increases Macron's chances. This is "Hillary's going to win anyway, don't sully yourself by voting for her" redux.

 I thank you for dropping the personal insults in this reply.

You're welcome for your hypocritical repeated painting of your opponent as dirtied by a personal insult. You could have *actually* taken the high-ish road by leaving it at one statement that tried to position yourself as personally better than your opponent, but you needed a second round of transparent self-flattery. You deserve an insult. </TEXT>

<TEXT> An accusation of sophistry is meant as a criticism of your argument. I'm criticizing your comparison of Western democratic institutions with autocracy as though they both need toppling. 

You're promoting false equivalence between Macron and Le Pen as enemies of "fellow workers" while writing off the workers who will be directly targeted by Le Pen's ethnonationalism. Macron's extra month's pay for low-wage workers in the form of a permanent tax exemption, and 50 billion in new public spending, including 15 billion for job training as well as environmental, health, and infrastructure spending isn't nearly as left as I would like, but the French public has already decided they don't want someone as left as you or I would like. But you are sending France's most vulnerable people to the wolves by promoting abstention. You can protest for more progress and work harder to convince French citizens to vote for someone more to your liking next time after you've ensured some minimal level of human decency for all of France's people this time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It does look like the preliminary injunction, which Judge Alsup has made clear is coming, will be more broad than "stop working on disputed LIDAR," and more like "freeze everything Levandowski touched." The big question is how long this trial lasts vs. how long Uber's current funding lasts, because it's got to be difficult to raise money for a company that's losing $3 billion a year *and* that has its only path to survival blocked by a judge. Uber raised $4.65 billion in investment and loans in mid-2016. If that runs out at the end of 2017, what do they have left? </TEXT>

<TEXT> We won't know how much their hands will be tied until we see the order. But designing an economical LIDAR is not easy, and Uber will need to fund its money-burning taxi business in the meantime. Last year, the company got a Saudi investment of $3.5 billion and a loan of $1.15 billion. But also last year, it burned through $3 billion. So Uber may need more money soon, and it may have way more trouble getting it now. It may be impossible to fund its current operations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Self-driving cars aren't going to disrupt the business model, they *are* the business model. Uber's first goal is to gain market share by any means necessary, including breaking the law and losing billions of dollars. Their second goal is to remove all the drivers and take all their wages for themselves to become profitable. Suddenly they're a company with hundreds of millions of profitable customers. The advantage of having hundreds of millions of paying customers from the outset is huge.

This injunction threat, and possibly a permanent injunction, is a potentially mortal blow because it could delay Uber's path to self-driving profitability enough that someone else, like Waymo, could get there first. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem is not about him and his wife, it's about the workers who are shut out. Government should not exclude women from one-on-one meetings and social functions. We already see some men without these rules going out for drinks with the guys and making deals, having one-on-one interviews with men and passing over women. To codify that as a way of doing business and government is a problem. </TEXT>

If Democrats aren't allowed to use the filibuster, why should they be persuaded by Republican threats to destroy something that only benefits Republicans? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Only because Countdown is for nerds, I will be a nerd and point out there are problems with some of these Venn diagrams. For example, "Members of crews" should just be a circle that has the words "Pirates" and "Hip-hop artists" in it, because "Members of crews" is a set, and "Pirates" and "Hip-hop artists" are items in that set. Or, the circle labeled "Pirates" should have Blackbeard and Captain Morgan in it, the circle "Hip-hop artists" should have Biggy and Tupac in it, and "Members of crews" should be an even larger superset encircling both sets, with flight attendants and stage hands elsewhere in that larger circle. Or, really, there should just be a list titled "Members of crews," with "Pirates" and "Hip-hop artists" as items on that list.

"Reasons my husband pissed on me" could also be a list, as well as most of the intersections on the super-diagram, except for the last one: Countdown + Bellends = This show should just be an equation.

And now I've taken all the fun out of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Black people vote Democratic because of Republicans' Southern Strategy, opposition to civil rights, and the continued presence of people like Steve King in the party. The Republican party is not a reasonable option. Meanwhile, white people have always voted for the Republican presidential candidate ever since JFK called for what became the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He was assassinated, Goldwater ran against it, Southern states started flying the Confederate Flag again (they hadn't since the Civil War), and the White South switched from Democratic to Republican, because of race.

White identity politics are the only reason why identity politics exist. If minorities were not discriminated  against, they would never have to band together politically to fight it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That was a shorthand example to make it clear that the source was not organic Sanders supporters. Here's more:

 People were so anti-Hillary that no matter what you said, they were willing to share it and spread it, she said. At first I would just laugh about it. I would say, Cmon, this is beyond ridiculous. I created a word called ridiculosity. I would say, This reeks of ridiculosity.

But Cowling got pushback. **She was called a Hillbot and a Trump supporter.** She ended up removing dozens of members who refused to stop pushing conspiracy theories. **I lost quite a few friends**, she said.

... None of the fake stories stood out to Smollon. He described the Facebook groups as being in a room filled with blasting televisions. It was hard to pick out the loudest noises. The ultimate goal of this **wasnt so much misinformation as distraction from valid info**, he concluded.

But Smollon **had a hard time convincing other Bernie supporters** that they were being played. No one cared, Smollon said. At that point, **you were a Hillary shill**. It was like an echo chamber of anger.

Even when pointing out that something like NBCPolitics.org was a fake site  the real site is NBCNews.com/politics  he drew criticism. **He was eventually removed as a moderator from one of the pro-Sanders Facebook groups.** Its the closest Ive been to being gaslit in my life, he said.

The people who spoke up about it during the campaign were insulted, ostracized, and pushed out. It was a poisonous environment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Basic income pays the same to workers and non-workers. Men and women will both get the same amount of money. Men and women will both be able to quit their jobs and live off basic income only. The only reason basic income will help women more than men is because women will be laid off at a higher rate, taking away from them their choice of whether to work, a choice that more men will still have. It only helps women more because women will be worse affected by automation of industries like retail and hospitality, and will therefore be more needy of the exact same amount of cash men will get.

Your argument is like getting upset at public restrooms for giving an unfair advantage to the homeless. No, public restrooms are equally available to all, they're just of more *value* to the homeless. Homeless people don't get extra public restrooms, but the same public restrooms that you have access to are more valuable to the homeless because without them, the homeless would have no restrooms at all.

You will get the same money as a woman. But because women will be laid off at higher rates, that money will be more valuable to them. You will still be free to become jobless. Just as you're free to become homeless and mooch off the lucrative public restroom benefits. </TEXT>

"Do women deserve MORE help than men?" is another strawman. No one has proposed more help to women, basic income is distributed equally. But if women will lose 20 jobs for every 1 gained, while men will lose 4 jobs for every 1 gained, then basic income will provide a more valuable income replacement (vs. mere income supplement) to more women than men.

<TEXT> The writers aren't negotiating with consumers, though, they're negotiating with studios. Our access to content will make it more bearable for us, but they're not trying to make us suffer. If people go online for content, though, networks could lose out, especially if people go to Netflix instead of, say, ABC.com. Even if people do visit network websites, the ad revenue is smaller online. So networks will still be pressuring studios to make a deal. One way networks are better positioned, though, is that they have more reality formats available to them, they've been ramping up production of primetime game shows, and there's strong demand for news, so longform newsmagazine shows could proliferate.

<TEXT> Given your argument that he asked one reasonable question and got crucified for it, I decided to read the report from the hearing (there was an official hearing into the matter, not a feminist lynch mob), and here are some of the things he said in just this one trial:

"She knew she was drunk []. Is not an onus on her to be more careful?"

"Young wom[e]n want to have sex, particularly if theyre drunk"

"why didn't [she] just sink [her] bottom down into the basin so he couldnt penetrate [her]"

"why couldn't [she] just keep [her] knees together"

"if she skews her pelvis slightly she can avoid him"

"Some sex and pain sometimes go together [] that's not necessarily a bad thing"

"sex is very often a challenge"

The judge didn't make one offhand comment that he got railroaded for, he continually argued that the woman is at fault for being drunk, for not fighting the man off, for complaining about a struggle and pain because challenge and pain are part of sex. It is reasonable for a female rape victim to question whether she could ever get a fair hearing from this judge, because of all these preconceived notions he puts on the scale about how women are like when they're drunk, how a good victim fights off her attacker, how pain and a struggle are normal, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Men buy guns more than women and therefore have a more effective method of suicide at their disposal, despite women being more depressed and attempting more suicides. Is men's higher rate of gun ownership oppression? (They also use those guns to kill women at a much higher rate than the reverse.)

Men are attracted to more dangerous jobs and take more risks, but are male police and firefighters oppressed by not being outnumbered by women? This is an argument for funding OSHA, not another bullet point on a laundry list of oppressed male resentment.

Females outlive males even among non-human primates. It is not anti-man society's oppression causing this. Men are the subject of more medical research than women, and the life expectancy gender gap is actually narrowing as men's lifespans are increasing faster than women's. Where is the oppression?

And the study you cited showed temporarily higher wages for women in their 20s *if women go to college and men do not*, which is soon reversed as men get promoted and women take on stay-at-home parenting at higher rates than men. This is an argument for programs such as free community college and vocational training, as well as more parental leave and childcare support, but it is not a picture of male oppression. 20-something men make more than 20-something women of equal schooling, and after promotions and parenthood, not even school matters: men earn more than women, regardless.

This feels a lot like someone's taken a preexisting position of men being treated unfairly, and backfilled it with a hodgepodge of stats that don't stand up to scrutiny. It's like when certain men complain that women get custody of children more than women, but neglect to mention that when men actually *request* custody, they are granted it at equal rates.

Again, I'm a man. I have nothing against men. I do have a problem with unfounded resentment of spurious oppression of men, because it feels an awful lot like junk science compiled to justify preexisting resentment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Automation could actually end up having a bigger impact on women's employment: According to one [study](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/18/women-to-lose-out-in-jobs-revolution-wef-warns), for every 20 jobs women are expected to lose to automation, they are expected to gain only 1, due to overrepresentation in automatable industries and underrepresentation in STEM. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This looks more immediately practical than Momentum Machines' Rube Goldberg approach, as demonstrated by the fact that it's already being deployed. At the moment, it only flips burgers and puts them on a bun, but that's a useful labor-saving skill on its own. (I wondered why they didn't just create a griddle "slot" that heated both sides simultaneously instead of creating a high-tech flipper, until I saw the arm transfer the patty to the bun.) You can imagine a future arm programmed to add toppings, or one that ferries fries in and out of the fryer. There's already an [automatic drink maker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akv4vSXa5a4) in operation.

By having the robot adapt to the kitchen, instead of replacing the kitchen with a complex assembly system as Momentum does, you allow a human to take over if the machine is out of service. This also keeps the griddle in service if the restaurant wants or needs to change what it makes or how it makes it without reconfiguring a closed-box contraption.

I'm excited to see new automation in action, but worried about the eventual impact. The video tries to stress "there's still a happy worker there, smiling at his robot buddy," but the only reason to do this is to reduce labor. And the restaurant industry is a massive employer. </TEXT>

Members of the Front de libration du Qubec (FLQ) kidnapped the provincial cabinet minister Pierre Laporte and the British diplomat James Cross. In response, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau invoked the only peacetime use of the War Measures Act. The kidnappers murdered Laporte, and negotiations led to Cross's release and the kidnappers' exile to Cuba.

I couldn't post it because it's a blog post, but it's written by the former editor of the Village Voice, who now writes extensively about Scientology.

The LAPD has long been accused of covering for Scientology, which funds LAPD charities and has a policy called "safe-pointing" to develop financial and other relationships with local police and officials for "protection." In this report, a victim had her case transferred to one officer at the LAPD who took a particular interest in her case. The officer warned her not to speak with any other officers about her case, and took her case out of the LAPD computers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It looks like you might be from Singapore, so I'm guessing this is a sincere question (but it looks funny to an American). I know that especially in smaller, more densely populated countries, department stores are more likely to be in population centers and carry groceries, but in the US, most department stores and enclosed shopping malls are in suburbs miles away from the city center, where property is cheaper, often off highways. You generally can't walk to them, and they don't carry groceries. It became more common in the '90s for a single upscale mall to open in the city center, but you can't run an efficient and competitive grocery operation with only one store per city.

In residential areas, there are grocery store chains, as well as superstores like Walmart and Target that sell general merchandise in addition to groceries. They differ from department stores in a few ways, most definitionally in that they don't have registers in each department and instead have a bank of registers at the front of the store. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They're different categories in NAICS, the coding system used by government, and are therefore reported separately in government reports. Another big difference is that US department stores don't carry groceries and are therefore not part of consumers' weekly shopping habits. It's a good thing they're reported separately, too, because they're experiencing very different sales trends, and we couldn't see that if we didn't make the distinction. Consumers are clearly treating department stores and superstores differently, so why shouldn't we distinguish them? </TEXT>

They're performing a lot better than department stores, but recently, the stores (excluding online operations) have started to see falling real sales, meaning sales growth isn't keeping up with inflation, or sales are falling. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The easiest and most immediately effective step would be to make their taxation progressive (it's currently [regressive](http://www.itep.org/whopays/states/michigan.php)), so that they stop literally taking money from the poor. However, Republicans are proposing the opposite. They recently caved on a plan to eliminate their (slightly progressive) income tax altogether, which would leave them to rely more on their highly regressive sales tax that hits the poor hardest and a property tax that hits the middle class hardest. But Republicans are back with a new income tax cut, again leaving the resulting tax structure more regressive than before, putting a greater share of the state's tax burden on the poor and middle class. (And in other states where Republicans cut income taxes, they subsequently raised sales taxes to make up the losses, redistributing wealth from the poor to the rich.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know reddit loves contrarians, but conscription at the ages studied is universal for Jewish Israelis, and the rule applied to everyone. There was no control group of similar people available, except for *the same people on weekdays*, for whom suicides stayed the same.

It's called [means restriction](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/10/health/blocking-the-paths-to-suicide.html), and the same effect has been observed in [different scenarios:](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92319314)

In England, death by asphyxiation from breathing oven fumes had accounted for roughly half of all suicides up until the 1970s, when Britain began converting ovens from coal gas, which contains lots of carbon monoxide, to natural gas, which has almost none. During that time, suicides plummeted roughly 30 percent  and the numbers haven't changed since. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And for those without the time to read the study: **Suicides did not go up on weekdays** to compensate (they were unchanged).

It basically just comes down to not having an effective suicide method readily available. [Most people don't plan their suicide:](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92319314)

70 percent [of suicide attempt survivors] said they **thought about it for less than an hour**; and a whopping 24 percent said the idea had occurred to them less than five minutes before their attempt.

Another example (same source):

In England, death by asphyxiation from breathing oven fumes had accounted for roughly half of all suicides up until the 1970s, when Britain began converting ovens from coal gas, which contains lots of carbon monoxide, to natural gas, which has almost none. During that time, **suicides plummeted roughly 30 percent**  and the numbers haven't changed since.

Removing a suicide method like a gun works the same way as removing carbon monoxide coal gas did there, as [guns are the deadliest method of suicide.](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/07/21/guns-most-deadly-choice-in-suicide-attempts/2572097/)

Also, stories about suicide have been shown to make depressed people think about suicide, so I want to put the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline number here: **1-800-273-8255**. There's also [online chat](http://chat.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/GetHelp/LifelineChat.aspx). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was thinking Pence would wait until after the midterms, because of how term limits work for partial terms. If someone is president for the majority of a term (over 2 years), they can only have one more term. But if they've been in office less than 2 years, they can have two more terms,  or nearly ten years in office. But Trump may be forcing an early intervention. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mao was not the first dictator to use the phrase enemies of the people, of course. Nazi German leaders applied it to the Jewish people decades before, including Goebbels, who declared them a sworn enemy of the German people. Hitlers writing, thinking, and perhaps actions may have been inspired by an Ibsen play of the same name, some scholars believe.

This is the more likely inspiration, given Ivana's revelation that he [kept a book of Hitler's speeches on his nightstand.](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/09/trump-files-donalds-big-book-hitler-speeches) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Try a nearby credit union for fee-free banking. They have networks of thousands of free ATMs, too.

For occasional international travel, I'd recommend a credit card with no foreign transaction fee and no annual fee, preferably a Visa, which is most widely accepted. The only card I can think of that fits those criteria is a BofA Travel Rewards card. You don't need a BofA bank account to get it, and it doesn't require excellent credit. A credit card is safer abroad, because the creditor is liable for 100% of all fraudulent charges, even if you don't notice for weeks. If you don't want debt, just pay it off before interest is charged, which is 25 days after the monthly cycle ends. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Illegals" is used against Latinos as part of a concerted effort in conservative media to demonize non-whites through negative word association. Muslims only get talked about in terms of "radical Muslims," "Islamic terrorists," etc. Immigrants are only worth discussion if it's to foment anger at "illegal immigrants." Black people are reduced to "violent inner cities" and "racist Black Lives Matter."

So what word association do whites get? "White working class." Never any other race of working class. Whites only.

So now you know which races and ethnicities are the good guys and bad guys, thanks to the intentional efforts of conservative media to change how you think about people of different races and ethnicities by the very words used to discuss them. </TEXT>

A DHS official confirmed that while immigration agents were targeting criminals, they also were taking into custody non-criminals in the vicinity who were found to be lacking documentation.

---
ICE agents had raided homes, and were not just detaining individuals they are looking for ... but in fact, taking anyone else in the community, or in these homes who does not have immigration status at the moment, or who is not able to prove citizenship, Barrientos said.

In some cities, activists said that ICE had set up roadside or neighborhood checkpoints, where ICE agents, often in unmarked cars, appeared to be asking people at random for proof of citizenship or identification.

If you look Latino, you need to keep your ID on you at all times or you'll be detained. We're a "papers please" society now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the population centers like Lexington and Louisville, most people voted for Hillary, and Republicans are not exactly Trump Republicans. Trump voters skew more elderly and non-college-educated than Republicans in general, so not only are city residents less likely to be Republican, Republicans in those cities are less likely to be first-choice Trump supporters. And if you generally interact with Republicans at work, you'll be interacting even less with the retirees and non-college-educated folks who are bigger Trump fans. </TEXT>

But even if you have more faith in Trump and don't think Elon is just there because Elon needs favorable regulations, Elon doesn't have to promote a "middle way" on an ethnic immigration ban as though outright opposing such a thing is unreasonable. He's telling us we should "offer amendments" instead of oppose Trump's unnecessary ban. Either Trump is using him or he's using himself to calm Trump's opponents.

<TEXT> Google Voice transcripts have improved a lot, but they almost always get the phone number wrong, so I always have to play the voicemail so I don't call a wrong number. Does everyone experience this? Someone called me twice, each time repeating their phone number twice, and Google Voice got it wrong all four times in three different ways. I'm in the Northwest, so it's not like Google's having to decipher a strong regional accent. I assume the problem is that phone numbers are random digits that have no contextual clues from the surrounding words. But it's also just 10 digits to learn to distinguish. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're proving my point. This is a story about completely legal immigrants. No one being kept out has killed anyone, they're totally legal US visa holders. And yet here you are getting all sanctimonious about illegals (a word that is never applied to Americans who are actually convicted of crimes, yet gets applied to kids who have done absolutely nothing wrong, and people who come here legally and just overstay a visa) which has nothing to do with this.

This is Fox News's goal. Whip up the supposed threat of (massively declined) illegal immigration, brush aside some throwaway phrase about how you're not talking about the good ones. Get it to the point to where Fox News viewers see a Latino, they suspect them of being illegal and harbor negative sentiment to them.

Whip up fear of terrorists, among an audience that is statistically more likely to die from virtually any other thing imaginable. Push aside stories of whites killing Muslims. Get it to the point to where a Fox News viewer sees a Sikh on an airplane, they worry about Islamic terror.

Only talk about the white working class. Don't even acknowledge that the working class is very diverse. *White* working class. It doesn't matter that their race has nothing to do with it, assign a race to workers, and make it white.

Ta-da: Fox News has meticulously explained to you who the bad guys are: illegal immigrants, Muslim extremists, and, oh yeah, the violent "inner cities" (black people on screen). All to be feared by the good guys: The white working class. </TEXT>

If you're forced to watch Fox, it's all "illegal immigrants," radical Islam" and "violent inner cities" (they want to say "violent blacks" but the closest they'll go is "violent Black Lives Matter"), all the ethnic enemies of the white working class.

<TEXT> I suspect this will have the same outcome as other automated coffee kiosks: It won't really take off. The technology isn't the problem, but customers still think of a traditional coffee shop as better, and they're everywhere. This robot cafe looks particularly colorless and sterile. You're trying to convince groggy people to start their mornings with you. Looking like an abandoned laboratory may not work.

I suspect the automation of coffee shops will happen more the way Starbucks is doing it. Machines already make your coffee, and mobile ordering is growing, in which you order your coffee from your phone, including ahead of time. This reduces the staff at coffeeshops, sometimes down to one person, without publicly branding the cafe as automated, which some customers think of as dystopian, less friendly, or like a coffeemaker. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While I don't know if quality frozen meals would be more than a niche, one big factor is that restaurant meals cost more, due to the staff and prime rents. Once automated home delivery, such as by self-driving cars, becomes possible, meals could be cooked on demand and delivered efficiently. While others are right that there would still be occasions to prefer a restaurant, this "restaurant delivery" at near grocery store prices would likely take market share from both restaurants and grocery stores. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This would be like a White ban, then starting with Africa.

He specifically highlighted that he only chose majority-Muslim countries, and that he is prioritizing Christians for refuge. The headline didn't call it a Muslim ban, and neither did the text. It accurately said it was based on religion rather than a specific event. No one from these countries has been involved in terror killings of Americans. Saudis have, but they're not banned, because like some of the other countries you listed, Trump has political and business interests in maintaining relations there. This isn't about our security. It's about us-vs-them politics. The radical Muslims. The illegal immigrants. The violent inner cities. These are the big threats to the white working class in our great-like-it-used-to-be America.

<TEXT> More ad hominem. The standard response to your original fallacy is that pointing out that something is old doesn't mean something is good. In fact, the electoral college is fundamentally anti-democratic, as it makes most Americans' votes worthless, whether you're rural or urban, and presidential candidates respond by ignoring most Americans. If you were honest with yourself, you support the electoral college because it puts Republicans in the White House. And spare us any false bromides about how the electoral college made rural farm issues important in this election, and the other standard smokescreens. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a good effort by a National Review writer to try to make it seem banal. But the real stories of who is affected cuts through that. Samira Asgari, a 30-year old Iranian woman who was on her way to the US to start a postdoctoral fellowship in genomics at a Harvard-affiliated hospital, was told her visa was no longer valid and denied boarding a US-bound flight in Frankfurt. Nazanin Zinouri, a Clemson engineering graduate of Iranian descent whod lived in the US for seven years and legally worked at a technology firm, was blocked from returning from a trip to visit her parents. Suha Abushamma, a doctor at the Cleveland Clinic with a Sudanese passport, was denied entry in the US and forced to leave the country. Now the world's scientists will avoid the US, and all that talent will go to other countries instead. International conferences will have to be held abroad to accommodate everyone, and to avoid the possibility of more chaotic surprise immigration orders. But foreign-born persons inside the United States can't attend, because they could be barred from returning to the US. This is not normal. This hurts the United States. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Again, can you name something the DNC did? The DNC did not act on that, and you didn't say what about the debates made them extremely favorable to Hillary.

However, Bernie Sanders did repeatedly lie about the DNC and the debates. He said they reduced the number of debates by falsely comparing the 6 debates they scheduled in 2016 with the total number of debates in 2008, when it turns out the DNC only scheduled 6 debates in 2008 as well (and also 6 in 2004, it's always 6), and that it's up to the candidates to agree to additional debates. According to O'Malley, Sanders refused additional debates, allowing the anti-DNC narrative to continue. Sanders also said the debates were poorly scheduled to hide them, when in fact the DNC scheduled the higher-rated broadcast debates earlier in the schedule where Sanders would get the most benefit, while the RNC delayed their broadcast debates and even cancelled the NBC one. All broadcast debates for Republicans and Democrats were scheduled for weekends, so Sanders said that was a Democratic attempt to hide the debates, when it's actually the networks who decide their schedules. And actually, Democrats got a Sunday debate, which is a high-rated night. All cable debates were scheduled for weekdays, just like the Republicans. And the scheduling was done way before the NFL announced its schedule. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tl;dr: Completely legal immigrants, who are completely up-to-date on their paperwork and always have been, and who have never been charged with anything, can now be deported as criminals. Agents now just need to say a legal immigrant has done something "chargeable," and without any charges, they can be deported.

Legal immigrants were supposed to be the good guys, the ones anti-immigrant folks swore they weren't attacking when they branded immigrants as "illegal." But just like with "radical Islam," it's morphed into a demonization of the whole broader group. We now have ethnically classified good guys and bad guys, thanks to systematic word association. The good guys are "working class whites," and the bad guys are "illegal immigrants" and "radical Islam," with "violent and racist black ^^lives ^^matter " now also popular in conservative media. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For those behind the GFW:

Taiwan moved one step closer last month to becoming the first place in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage, when a legislative committee passed draft changes to the islands civil code.

The proposed amendments have been sent to party caucuses for negotiation and possibly further revision before a final version is approved outright or goes to a vote by the Legislative Yuan, a process that is expected to take months.

Still, the development was applauded by gay rights advocates, not just in Taiwan but in mainland China as well.

Among them was Lai Jeng-jer, a leading figure in the gay rights movement in Taiwan who now lives in Beijing. In 1999, Mr. Lai, who trained as an architect, opened Gin Gin in Taipei, Taiwans capital. It was billed as the first gay-themed bookstore in the Chinese-speaking world.

His mission was to create a space where sexual minorities could congregate openly and provide a platform to work for social change. In 2012, he moved to Beijing, where he and his business partner, Yeh Kenta, established what is now the Two Cities Cafe and Lounge. In an interview, Mr. Lai, 51, discussed the progress he had seen in gay rights, how Taipei differed from Beijing and how he dealt with the occasional visit by the Chinese police.

**How do you feel about the passage of the same-sex marriage proposals in Taiwan?**

Very happy. It was just drafts that were passed, and they still need to undergo a process of consultation among political parties and more readings, and we dont know what the final outcome will be. But most of my friends are delighted because, after years of campaigning for this, theres finally some progress.

Final passage would be a milestone. Some of my friends in mainland China have told me they might go to Taiwan. Up to now, if they wanted to get married, they had to go to the United States or Europe. I feel that the gay community in China has been greatly encouraged. Since we share a similar cultural background, they believe that if Taiwan can achieve this they can start to expect more for China.

Youve long been part of the gay rights movement in Taiwan. How do you see it developing?

Ive witnessed profound changes in Taiwan society since the lifting of martial law in the 1980s. I saw a lot of civic movements emerging and people taking to the streets to protest. I was quite young at the time and greatly inspired. I started to appreciate the significance of democratization.

Now, more and more people accept that, as a Taiwanese, its right to stand up for the underprivileged and the marginalized. Not just on same-sex marriage but on other issues, like environmental protection. Those who get involved are not always the ones directly affected, but they feel obligated to do something for those who are. Thats why, this time, weve also seen so many heterosexuals joining the demonstrations.

**How have you adjusted to the move from Taipei to Beijing?**

On Christmas Eve two years ago, we hosted a gay meet-up party at our cafe and invited about 20 people. In the middle of that, some police officers showed up and asked everyone to show their IDs. I was shocked, but our guests looked extremely calm. One after another, they took out their ID cards and showed them to the police. After the police finished checking them, they said fine and left. The party resumed, and our guests acted like nothing had happened. But I found it strange that they seemed so used to this kind of police intrusion.

Most of the people who come to our cafe are supportive. There are only a few who have objected. Once I saw a customer had commented on social media: It turned out to be a gay bar. I wont go there again.

Were not even a bar, let alone a gay bar. My colleague replied: This is a cafe from Taiwan with a theme of cultural diversity. Its not a gay bar, though we are in fact gay. Even if you dont like this, please still show some respect.

**How would you compare the gay communities in Taiwan and in Beijing?**

I have great admiration for any gay organizations that can survive in Beijing.

My cafe once hosted the Beijing Queer Film Festival. This is an international event that brings directors from all around the world. And when it comes to international events, theres usually trouble. The police tend to interfere.

The Queer Film Festival has been held about a dozen times, and seven or eight times its been forced to shut down midway. Once they held it at Tsinghua University, and when the police came, even a top university like that had to compromise.

So when we held it, we couldnt openly publicize it. What we did was send emails to people in which we didnt mention what was happening. We just told them to come watch a movie on which day and at what time. It turned out that a lot of people showed up, and the police didnt.

Some people joke about this situation. They say that in Taipei its called a gay movement, but in Beijing its gay activities. You can have all kinds of activities, but you cant allow any of them to turn into a movement.

Still, its not that hard to live in Beijing as a homosexual, if all you want is a quiet life and you avoid participating in any movements. Ive seen many lesbian couples kissing each other in the subway. Gays can also host parties at home. But you cant get involved in any protests or demonstrations. Basically, if you keep a low profile, the authorities dont interfere.

**Do you know any gay couples in Beijing who want to get married?**

I attended a wedding ceremony for a gay friend of mine. Hes the founder of Feizan, one of the biggest gay dating websites in China. He and his boyfriend sent us invitations for the event. But then he told guests that they should keep an eye out for a possible last-minute change of venue.

On the morning of the event, he telephoned that the site had changed. At noon he notified me that it was relocated again. That evening, they changed the site for the third time. Afterward, I learned that the police had called the first few places, which made them too scared to go through with it.

But finally there was a place near Ditan Park where they knew some people, and maybe because it was too late for the police to intervene, they succeeded in holding it. About 200 people attended. It was a very happy day.

Do you foresee the eventual legalization of same-sex marriage in mainland China?

Its possible. But its hard to tell how long it might take. Ive been living here for a while and can see the policy-making system in China is very different from what we have in Taiwan. Things can change very suddenly here. It might not take as long as in Taiwan. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most of that was abandoning a smaller store format they had recently rolled out. They tried smaller stores because their big supercenters are lagging in non-grocery categories. That's because when people who don't buy groceries at Walmart need other stuff, fewer are making a special trip to Walmart and are instead buying online. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry, it was late when I wrote that. The primary issue with Q3 2014 / Q3 2013 is that Q3 2013 experienced tiny growth, so not only would Q3 2014 create a deceptively large -100% change if it were zero, but by being negative by a small amount, it ended up being nearly -900%. Instead of a percent change chart, a dollar change chart would show the difference between Q3 2013 and Q3 2014 was minimal.

Y/Y eliminates seasonality. If it's not obvious how dividing a holiday surge by last year's holiday surge mitigates the surge, here's the [Dallas Fed](https://www.dallasfed.org/research/basics/seasonally.aspx):

One way analysts avoid the problem of seasonal fluctuation is to compare monthly or quarterly data on a year-over-year basis.

As they point out, it's more crude than the official seasonal adjustment, but it's still seasonal adjustment.

And holiday hiring is a common metric. I didn't find something esoteric or invent it myself. I also didn't use it to prove automation as anything but a secondary detail. I used it as an additional data point to show that seasonal retailers were suffering, on top of the direct data point that their sales are down. I then used the fact that Amazon is surging in those same seasonal categories to demonstrate that e-commerce is what's hurting those retailers, given that consumer spending in those categories is up. So you could say that I indirectly used seasonal retailers' weak hiring as a secondary data point for seasonal retailers' weakness, then used e-commerce's strength in those categories to demonstrate e-commerce hurting bricks-and-mortar within those categories.

Also, I'm not going to reply to this anymore, it's repetitive and no one else is voting or otherwise engaging in this conversation at this point, suggesting few people care. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The % Y/Y chart is thrown totally off scale by dividing a slightly positive Q3 2013 by a negative Q3 2014 (Edit: It was a small divisor that was the issue, it was late at night when I wrote this), making the rest hard to see. Also, it's difficult to make out Q4, which is the only part we care about, because % Y/Y removes the seasonality. Here's the simple narrative that a chart of just Q4's would show you: Holiday hiring rose year-over-year in 2004, 2005, 2006. Then in 2007, 2008, it fell during the recession. Next, it rose in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 as the economy recovered. Now, though, it's falling again in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Something is affecting the stores that hire for the holidays, outside of a recession. A look at sales for seasonal retail categories shows they're losing revenue. But consumer spending data shows people are still buying the type of goods they sell, just not in their stores. Various research firms show Amazon is at #1 or will be this year in those categories: Department stores (NRF), apparel (Cowen   Co.), electronics (TWICE), toys (Klosters), books/music/movies (everybody). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's how I phrased it in the original comment:

 By holiday hiring, I mean hiring gains from the end of Q3 to the end of Q4, compared to the same period a year ago.

Here's a chart showing retail employment change from the end of one quarter to the end of the next:

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=ci9h

You can see that holiday hiring (the big spikes) has been falling each year since 2013. I look at holiday hiring because there's an interesting connection between seasonal retailers (the ones that hire most for the holidays) and e-commerce. Seasonal retailers include most notably toy stores, electronics stores, clothing stores and department stores, and (formerly) music/movie/book stores. These are also the categories where e-commerce is gaining the most market share and hurting traditional retailers. Part of this connection is because people just hate the crowds during the holidays, so they buy these holiday product categories online while still going to the grocery store. But another part of it is that gifts that last for days under a tree by the fire tend to also be mailable. They're not too big and heavy (cars, furniture, major appliances, building supplies), they're not perishable (non-shelf-stable food and drink), and they're not liquid or flammable (gasoline). That neatly eliminates virtually all the major categories where e-commerce is currently weak. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's if you look at total retail, including car lots, gas stations, home improvement chains, etc., where e-commerce isn't much of a factor. But if you look at department stores, apparel, electronics, toys, books, movies and music, you see where the brick-and-mortar losses are, and where the e-commerce gains are.

E-commerce was an even smaller fraction of total retail just a few years ago, but it still killed off Borders, Blockbuster, Sam Goody, and nearly all the rest of the books/movies/music categories. Now it's targeting bigger sectors. </TEXT>

In the next recession, even more industries will again scramble to automate. The employment/population ratio will fall even further. Then employment will start to recover, slowly, but employment/population won't recover to where it is now, just as this recovery will never recover to the levels of the last recovery, and the last recovery never recovered to the levels of the recovery and expansion before that.

<TEXT> US manufacturing output is at a record high. US manufacturing jobs are near an all-time low, having recovered just a bit from the recession before contracting again. There is seriously a weird time-warp obsession with a high-paying large-scale manufacturing workforce that will never be recreated. There is zero reason to try to centrally plan our economy around an industry that has been shrinking in employees for **40 years** even as output rose. Because if we turn our heads just one degree to the left, we can see a whole growing army of workers in engineering, and if we turn our heads just one degree to the right, we can see a whole growing army of workers in construction, and we can realize that our tunnel vision on manufacturing is completely unnecessary. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Department store sales, in total, are shrinking. Real sales at apparel stores shrank in 2016, even with a huge assist from cold winter weather vs. a warmer winter last year. (Apparel retailers pray every year for a cold winter because it always drives more sales of heavy, high-margin winter clothing.) With fewer stores, total sales will be even lower as shoppers turn to the web rather than drive to an even farther-away mall.

The retail sectors that are seeing contracting sales are the exact ones that Amazon is either now #1 in or expected to be #1 in this year: Apparel, electronics, toys, and department stores. (Amazon is basically a virtual department store and competes with them to be consumers' "everything store.") Media stores (books, movies, music) already died after Amazon conquered them, with a shrunken Barnes and Noble the only national chain left. </TEXT>

JCPenney's CEO says they're about to close an undetermined number of stores, Nordstrom is said to be planning closures, and other retailers have just announced some very disappointing sales numbers that would seem to make additional closures inevitable.

The thing is, total retail sales are actually up, and so is consumer spending more broadly. But e-commerce is stealing sales from the traditional stores, and the reckoning is getting brutal.

Also, e-commerce employs about 1/4 as many workers as traditional stores relative to the amount sold, so this could start having an impact on jobs. Total holiday hiring in retail, including e-commerce, was 8.9% lower in 2016 than 2015. And e-commerce-related industries don't seem to be growing jobs fast enough to make up for the losses. Combined holiday hiring at USPS, UPS, FedEx, etc. was somehow flat this year despite e-commerce growing by over 10% like it does every year, and holiday hiring at warehouse companies was actually down, perhaps due to Amazon opening a ton of its own local fulfillment centers. (By holiday hiring, I mean hiring gains from the end of Q3 to the end of Q4, compared to the same period a year ago.) And self-driving cars and trucks, and maybe even drones, could start to reduce transportation employment, while robotics continues to slim down warehouse and manufacturing jobs.

<TEXT> The only games I've been able to find for Android are the Nougat Easter egg, and a game called HungerMoji that you interact with by swiping away notifications as new notifications appear. If swiping is the only option, a simple game could be blackjack, where you swipe "hit" or "stand" while the main notification updates with new cards. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Apparently there are a few notification games for iOS, including a couple flappy bird type games, minesweeper, 2048, and a "tribute" to the jumping dinosaur from Chrome.

There's also an Android version of that jumping dinosaur, except it's not really in the notifications, it's just a constantly hovering icon that you can open up. The icon is annoying and sometimes in the way, and the game is unusably laggy on my phone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I found a notification game called HungerMoji, but you have to start it by opening an app, and even if you leave the game waiting for you in the notifications while you watch a video, as soon as you decide to play it, it switches to the game app, even though you're playing it in the notifications. So it's basically useless for my purposes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This sub showed me a great app that displays a five-day weather forecast in the notification shade, called Weather Timeline [(Pic)](http://i.imgur.com/yAw399f.jpg).

That would be useful for when ads are playing in a video, for example, and you can't leave without stopping the video, but you can pull down the notifications. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The polls were [accurate within 1.1%](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html). Hillary won by 2.8 million votes and 2.1% compared to the 3.2% polling consensus after the Comey letter measurably pushed undecideds to Trump and measurably reduced Clinton's lead. So you can consider Trump's horrible favorability to be about 1.1% off. As for "I've seen the Trump rallies on TV," I refer you again to the millions more who voted for Clinton. A rally just packs a few thousand supporters, less than 0.1% of the electorate, into one place for a temporary period. It has nothing to do with who wins. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ABC has begun airing new seasons of Match Game, airing Wednesdays, and To Tell The Truth, which has been tweaked a bit from last season and airs Sundays. They're panel shows, but not in the British comedy quiz mold, so I may only post this once per season unless there's support for more. Here are the first new episodes. Use an ad blocker for all the links in this post.

* [Match Game S02E01](http://onwatchseries.to/episode/match_game_2016__s2_e1.html)
*  [To Tell The Truth S02E01](http://onwatchseries.to/episode/to_tell_the_truth_2016__s2_e1.html)

ABC has also renewed The $100,000 Pyramid and Celebrity Family Feud, but won't air them until until later. Here are all the back episodes of all four shows:

* [Match Game](http://onwatchseries.to/serie/match_game_2016_)
* [The $100,000 Pyramid](http://onwatchseries.to/serie/_100_000_pyramid)
* [To Tell The Truth](http://onwatchseries.to/serie/to_tell_the_truth_2016_)
* [Celebrity Family Feud](http://onwatchseries.to/serie/celebrity_family_feud_2015_)

And if you're in to this type of show, NBC airs [Hollywood Game Night](http://onwatchseries.to/serie/Hollywood_Game_Night) every year, and CBS aired [Million Dollar Password](https://www.youtube.com/results?q="million+dollar+password" sp=EgIYAg%253D%253D) in 2008-09. The Tonight Show also plays games like [Password](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hERzvxp5ab0 t=2m05s), [Pictionary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDHD5Bkxr_A t=90) and the "Would I Lie To You"-like game [True Confessions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-n5vol3CEE). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Please specify which theater you are referring to.

The Newberg facility has 5 classrooms because there is less demand  about 650 students a year. There is room to expand to accommodate additional demand. Newberg residents help pay for PCC, and PCC serves the community. The Newberg facility was explicitly part of the 2008 bond.

Energy efficiency, or "greening" as you scarequoted, was also explicitly part of the bond.

The 2008 bond can't subsidize tuition because it's dedicated to capital improvements and it's audited to ensure the funds are spent as agreed. [The ballot measure said](https://multco.us/file/19957/download) (PDF):

Measure would:  
 Construct, equip, furnish new buildings for additional
classrooms, other college uses at all four campuses,
at Washington County Workforce Training Center,
and in Newberg;  
 Renovate, update existing college facilities needing
heating, ventilation, plumbing, lighting, roofing;  
 Replace out-of-date equipment, facilities for
workforce training;  
 Expand and increase efficiency of classroom, library,
student support services space in existing buildings
at PCC campuses and in Sherwood;  
 Upgrade technology including distance learning
capabilities;  
 Make health, life safety, accessibility upgrades
including fire alarms, security systems, electrical
wiring;  
 Increase facilities energy efficiency;  
 Expand students childcare facilities;  
 Acquire some land, site improvements, buildings for
college services;  
 Pay associated bond issuance costs. </TEXT>

The Times was working on various articles related to the Chinese government. One of them, posted online on Dec. 29, revealed the billions of dollars in hidden perks and subsidies that the Chinese government provides to the worlds biggest iPhone factory. China is also one of Apples largest iPhone markets, though sales in that region have slowed.

On Dec. 23, David Barboza, a Times reporter, spoke with members of Apples media team about the article. Mr. Barboza had previously been in touch with the iPhone factory owner, Foxconn. He had also contacted the Chinese government as part of his reporting.

Later that day, a separate team from Apple informed The Times that the apps would be removed, Ms. Murphy said. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For those behind the GFW:

Apple, complying with what it said was a request from Chinese authorities, removed news apps created by The New York Times from its app store in China late last month.

The move limits access to one of the few remaining channels for readers in mainland China to read The Times without resorting to special software. The government began blocking The Timess websites in 2012, after a series of articles on the wealth amassed by the family of Wen Jiabao, who was then prime minister, but it had struggled in recent months to prevent readers from using the Chinese-language app.

Apple removed both the English-language and Chinese-language apps from the app store in China on Dec. 23. Apps from other international publications, including The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal, were still available in the app store.

We have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations, Fred Sainz, an Apple spokesman, said of the Times apps. As a result, the app must be taken down off the China App Store. When this situation changes, the App Store will once again offer the New York Times app for download in China.

Mr. Sainz declined to comment on what local regulations the Times apps were said to have violated, who had contacted Apple and when, and whether a court order or other legal document had been presented.

Chinas main internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, did not respond to faxed questions.

The Times bureau in Beijing said it had not been contacted by the Chinese government about the matter. A Times spokeswoman in New York, Eileen Murphy, said the company had asked Apple to reconsider its decision.

The request by the Chinese authorities to remove our apps is part of their wider attempt to prevent readers in China from accessing independent news coverage by The New York Times of that country, coverage which is no different from the journalism we do about every other country in the world, Ms. Murphy said in a statement.

The request appears to have been made under regulations released in June 2016 called Provisions on the Administration of Mobile Internet Application Information Services.

The regulations say apps cannot engage in activities prohibited by laws and regulations such as endangering national security, disrupting social order and violating the legitimate rights and interests of others. The cyberspace administration says on its website that apps also cannot publish prohibited information.

The ruling Communist Party tightly controls media inside China and employs one of the worlds most sophisticated systems of internet censorship. Chinese law prohibits the publication of harmful information online, and officials often take action without legal procedures or court orders against material they deem objectionable.

Apple has previously removed other, less prominent media apps from its China store. It is unclear how the company evaluates requests from Beijing to take down apps and whether it ever resists them.

Apples chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has said that the company complies with all local laws. While in early 2016 Apple resisted a court request in the United States for it to help federal officials unlock an iPhone for a criminal investigation, Mr. Cook said he would obey whatever order the court ultimately handed down. In the end, the government was able to unlock the device without Apple's help and the case was dropped.

Farzana Aslam, associate director of the Center for Comparative and Public Law at the University of Hong Kong, noted that in matters involving customer privacy, Apple requires governments to submit subpoenas, search warrants or other legal documents.

Maybe in the end they have to do it, but I think theres something to be said about standing up for what you believe in and purporting to put principle before profit in a country like China, to show that actually there is this tension there, Ms. Aslam said. Its not as simple as, Because we operate in your jurisdiction, well do anything you ask of us.

She added that it was very worrying that Apple had not disclosed what laws the authorities said were violated, making it difficult for The Times and other publishers to file an appeal or challenge the governments requests.

In the weeks leading up to the withdrawal of the Times apps, The Times was working on various articles related to the Chinese government. One of them, posted online on Dec. 29, revealed the billions of dollars in hidden perks and subsidies that the Chinese government provides to the worlds biggest iPhone factory. China is also one of Apples largest iPhone markets, though sales in that region have slowed.

On Dec. 23, David Barboza, a Times reporter, spoke with members of Apples media team about the article. Mr. Barboza had previously been in touch with the iPhone factory owner, Foxconn. He had also contacted the Chinese government as part of his reporting.

Later that day, a separate team from Apple informed The Times that the apps would be removed, Ms. Murphy said.

In another article, published on Dec. 22 as a post on its Sinosphere blog, The Times described an anti-Western internet video that had been widely promoted by Chinese public security offices.

The Times news apps remain available in Apples app stores for other countries, as well as the Hong Kong and Taiwan stores, but people must have a credit card with a billing address outside mainland China to download them. The Times crossword puzzle and virtual reality apps remain available throughout China.

When the Chinese government began blocking the Times websites in 2012, it also prevented users with Times apps from downloading new content.

But readers in China can still gain access to The Times using software that circumvents the governments firewall. And in July 2015, The Times released a new version of its Chinese-language app that adopted a different method for retrieving articles, one that the government appeared unable to stop.

Apples decision to remove the app from its China store should not affect those who have already installed it. But users in China will not be able to download new releases unless they use another regions app store.

The Times discovered after being blocked in 2012 that hackers with possible ties to the Chinese military had targeted the newspapers computer systems and that the attacks coincided with the reporting for that Times investigation.

Foreign tech companies face increasing pressure from government authorities in China. In April, Apples iBooks Store and iTunes Movies were shut down in the country, just six months after they were introduced there.

Mark Natkin, the Beijing-based managing director of Marbridge Consulting, who advises American technology firms in China, said he did not think any such company entering the Chinese market could ever fully comprehend how challenging its going to be.

Mr. Natkin said that Apple has a certain amount of leverage against the Chinese government in terms of the total amount of jobs created but that the technology gap has started to close. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They were both Tesco's own brand. They weren't advertising, they weren't using different distributors. Manufacturers have different SKUs for different colors or even different ingredients with different packaging that sell at different rates while maintaining price parity, or even pricing the more popular variety higher due to more demand. Coke even has massive ad campaigns for sodas that sell at very very different rates and they maintain price parity. It's not a coincidence that the sex disparity occurs across many products, they're just charging what the market will bear. It's not sexist in a "we hate women" way, it just leaves women with less money after buying the women's variety, regardless of whether the women's product is purchased more or less often than the men's product. </TEXT>

They still sold the same total razors, produced the same way in the same factory, some with blue dye and some with pink dye, and shipped the same total razors to Tesco. The pink ones didn't cost twice as much to produce. Green highlighter pens don't cost twice as much as orange highlighter pens because they're less popular. Maybe there's a fractional effect on production cost, but not a doubling. </TEXT>

Their website, [shop24global.com](http://www.shop24global.com/), is down, and their phone number, 866-973-2424, just plays a 5-second "no one is available" message and hangs up.

<TEXT> This chart is updated daily and is one of several hosted [here](https://sites.google.com/site/arctischepinguin/home/sea-ice-extent-area/grf) that automatically track sea ice using US government data, in this case from the [National Sea Ice Data Center](https://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index/archives.html), funded by NOAA and NASA.

You can see that there's usually a peak in global sea ice around June, when Antarctic ice is high~~est~~, and again around November, when the Arctic ~~is usually the most frozen~~ *is refreezing but Antarctica hasn't yet melted much*. But this year, record warmth is melting ice at both poles, leading to a chart that looks like 2016 just wandered off and got lost.

This chart shows sea ice area. Another measure is [sea ice extent](https://sites.google.com/site/arctischepinguin/home/sea-ice-extent-area/grf/nsidc_global_extent_byyear_b.png). The ELI5 difference is, "extent" tries to measure the total size of partial ice cover's boundaries, including the areas within that aren't covered, while "area" tries to only measure the actual amount of ice cover, excluding the parts that aren't covered.

Usually, Arctic and Antarctic sea ice are measured separately, since they're affected by different weather events and follow asynchronous patterns.

This is sea ice, not land ice, so sea ice can melt without *directly* affecting sea levels, just like a full glass of ice water doesn't overflow when the ice melts. Mountain glaciers and ice sheets on land melting into the sea is what raises sea levels. The problem with melting sea ice is that bright polar ice reflects the sun's energy back into space, keeping the poles cool, while darker liquid seas absorb heat, reinforcing a warming feedback loop *which can lead to melting land ice and higher seas*. Ice melt also affects salinity and ocean currents. Polar vortexes can weaken and push cold air out to more populated areas. And polar ice is important to polar animals that become stranded and die as the ice disappears.

This chart will update daily, so you can bookmark it and keep track.

Edit: ~~Old text~~ and *new text*. </TEXT>

And demanding that issues shouldn't be discussed unless they're relevant to white men is just never going to happen as a practical matter. If certain people can't hear Hillary or Obama constantly talking about jobs because of race or gender, that's really not something they can change. Civil rights and women's rights were much bigger topics of conversation in the past. Top story on the news.

<TITLE> Fake news about Elon Musk and "FEMA tunnels" is being spread </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-19 20:12:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT>  Global Goal Nine: Infrastructure of the New World Order - Elon Musk to Construct FEMA Tunnels under US Cities?

This was an actual "featured story" on Google News, meaning that when you click the "show more" link on a related story, it appears below it with the word "Featured." I found another version of this story on Facebook. It's from "The Christian Truther," but don't give it traffic. Instead, I'll just quote the crazy parts.

I don't know if this is organically occurring craziness, or a bizarre new front in the "Stop Elon From Failing Again" propaganda effort.

 America is set for a remodel in the coming years. According to Donald Trump, were going to rebuild our cities, and rebuild our infrastructure. While a remodel is needed, the architecture and plans are concerning; the latest proposal by Elon Musk is alarming, because of its similarity to the mysterious FEMA tunnels.

 Throughout 2015, Americans were concerned with Jade Helm 2015, Walmart remodels, and tunnels. In 2016, we were concerned with the possibility of Hillary Clinton obtaining office or Obama staying in office as president. For 2017, a new/old concern is arising  tunnels.

(Here it gives a basic explainer about the project, as well as hyperloops.)

 ... While Elon Musk is one of many who has made such proposals, it is important to note, that Elon Musk is also an adviser to Donald Trump. That said, Musks projects align directly with other globalist ideology that America is set for a remodel into a globalist country.

 Infrastructure proposals have come from other globalists as well, such as Parag Khanna who believes that America should become a full-blown technocracy. Parag Khanna sat as an advisor to Obama, while Musk is an advisor to Trump.

 Similarly, the United Nations has an agenda for the globe, set in stone in 2015, the 2030 Agenda sprung into being as a continuation of Agenda 21. Under Agenda 2030 are a set of goals for humanity. Goal Nine is currently in focus in regard to infrastructure.

 Having previously likened, Parag Khannas work to that of a United Nations plot, and Parags proposals to that of the FEMA Regions Map. Musks work is also strikingly similar to the United Nations ploy, agenda 2030.

 The Boring Company

 Elon has proposed various times that he would like to see tunnels under cities come about to alleviate the congestion and traffic. However, is there another agenda at play?

 For decades, people far and wide have warned about the coming FEMA tunnels; now Elon Musk is reportedly going to construct them, under US cities. Even though Musk has proposed it, Trump has to approve it. This means that currently there is no telling what the plans would be for underground tunnels  but it significantly appears as though the globalists are gearing up to construct the Megacities of the New World Order.

 The only question is, with Parag Khanna designing the FEMA map, through infrastructure, is Elon Musk creating the FEMA tunnels?

The end. I was fortunate enough not to know what FEMA tunnels were. An article titled "US FEMA DEATH CAMPS  WALMART TUNNELS  COFFINS  AMERICA IS FASCIST" wasn't as helpful as it appears, but after wading through other incoherent articles riddled with all caps, my general sense is that there are undercover FEMA camps hidden inside giant Walmarts, where people, maybe with Ebola, are being secretly jailed, and are dying, while mysterious tunnels lead to unknown destinations, perhaps top secret underground military facilities, and it's all going to unravel when martial law, which Jade Helm is practice for, goes into effect. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The respondents use two basic defenses. One is the generalized prejudice that "Koreans are racist," therefore their own racism is justified. It's awfully convenient that they can convict all their Korean targets with guilt, so that their own racism isn't their own fault or responsibility, it's merely justified punishment for others' guilt. And I'm sure they spent time translating the Koreans' comments to make sure they were guilty before being racist toward them.

But being an asshole is not justified by the real or imagined presence of other assholes.

The other defense is that it's a joke. Neo-Nazis explicitly use racist jokes to move the Overton window toward white supremacy. They literally admit and promote using racist jokes as a propaganda tactic. When people call them out on their racism, they lash out  "We need our safe space to call Michelle Obama an ape without criticism!" And then they demonize those who point out their behavior as SJWs. Because you're not supposed to care about the non-whites. SJW is just a more broadly applicable version of nigg*r-lover. You can use it to attack people who defend not just black people, but literally anyone other than racists. </TEXT>

<TEXT> People actually got upset that the media was portraying it as a close race. This sub got upset at people who warned against complacency. I do believe people thought they were free to cast protest votes because they thought Clinton would win, though. Many people said they would vote minor party or stay home unless it was close.

The big problem, though, was the FBI repeatedly, falsely, criminalizing Hillary for two years. And they can do the same thing in 2020. They literally don't need to have a case to falsely criminalize Trump's opponent. This is how a country's security forces install a strongman.

Russian disinformation and hacking also hurt, but the FBI's eternal email drama was the big story that killed her. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jill Stein is untrustworthy. There is no federal right to a free recount for someone with no chance of winning. This is a path to keep the money. When sued by donors, she'll be able to use the defense of "I tried to conduct a recount, but the courts didn't let me," when in fact she had the money to pay for a recount the legal way and turned it down. She's already said she's going to keep the millions she doesn't use for recounts rather than refund them, and she keeps raising her cash goal to drain more Democrats.

<TEXT> That U6 number has now fallen within the normal range and is continuing to fall, a big improvement from 17.1%, showing that the job market is improving, not falling behind. The record-high number of retirees due to baby boomers and longer lifespans is skewing labor participation figures, which is what that aggressive and not universally agreed upon 250,000 number is based on. Any measure of the health of the job market has to look at the actual job market, not everyone 16 and over, which includes students, stay-at-home parents, the disabled, retirees, the independently wealthy and others who simply are not looking for work and are not an indicator of how easy it is to get a job. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Labor participation is skewed by the non-participation of elderly retirees, who now represent a greater share of the population than ever before, thanks to the baby boom and longer lifespans. If you want to understand the real economic situation of people, you have to understand that not everyone 16 and over wants to work like the participation rate suggests, including students, homemakers, the disabled, retirees, the independently wealthy, and others who simply aren't job seekers. And if you want to know how easy or tough it is to find a job, if you want to measure the health of the actual *job market*, then you only look at people in the market. Someone who hasn't looked for a job in years isn't an indicator of how easy it is to find a job or how healthy the job market is. They do have an impact on the economy, just as a bunch of retirees do, but the economy is not to blame for their lack of job-seeking in an economy at 4.6% unemployment.

As for wages, there's always some monthly noise, but wages are rising faster than inflation on an annualized basis. </TEXT>

Except Democrats aren't competing there, either. They're not working to turn out as many people in LA and SF as possible.

<TEXT> People often ask "Who cares?" or "What difference does it make?" A few answers:

* A reason to fight. Most Americans, including Donald Trump, understand the basic fairness of "one person, one vote." When people see injustice, they want to fight it. And when you want to fight, you stand a much better chance of winning.
* A reason to hope, not despair. America has not turned into a racist, pussy-grabbing majority. The Democrats won the most votes for the sixth time out of seven. We aren't outnumbered, we're underrepresented.
* A reason to strategize. When you have enough votes to win, but your voters don't matter because of their location, you can strategize. You can encourage Democrats in blue states who are thinking of new schools, jobs, and retirement destinations to consider swing states and swing districts. You can press more states, like Oregon, to pass the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact.
* It's reality. The number of votes for each candidate is a basic fact of the election. There should be no opposition to reporting it. </TEXT>

In the 7 years that followed, US manufacturing jobs rose. What really hurt US manufacturing was the rise of China, where manufacturing jobs were shipped to starting in 2001 under Bush, exacerbated by China's admission to the WTO that year. [(Chart)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MANEMP)

China is what hurt US manufacturing. China is not in NAFTA, as the first two letters make clear. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It looks like they have 7 chutes to drop from, but 15 slots, with the chutes in the middle. It looks like there's a high-value board and a low-value board. Here's the high-value board. I've bolded the slots that have chutes directly above them.

1, 50K, 100, 100K, **1**, **200K**, **1**, **300K**, **1**, **400K**, **10**, 500K, 100, MILLION, 1

And here's the low-value board:

1, 5K, 100, 20K, **10**, **10K**, **1**, **25K**, **1**, **10K**, **10**, 20K, 100, 5K, 1

For the high values, it looks like you'd always want to drop from the chute the farthest to the (audience's) right, if you have a green ball. I'm not sure if you know it's green (right answer, adds money) or red (wrong answer, subtracts money) before you drop it, though. It looks like you may have to load the balls into the chutes before you answer the questions, or at least before you know whether you got them right.

This looks like a lot of fun, but I could imagine the winnings ultimately being pretty low, given that you can lose up to a million dollars with each drop as well as win a million. I suspect they wouldn't let you fall below zero, though, they'd just wipe you out or maybe send you home if you had $100k but lost a million. Otherwise, you could have people in negative millions having to finish the game knowing it's pointless. </TEXT>

There was a lot of criticism during the Bush years that painting Bush as an entertaining fool rather than a threat helped humanize and reeleect him, when they should have put torture and lies about the Iraq War squarely on his shoulders.

<TEXT> That's an argument for not contradicting people's opinions with facts. That's paralyzing.

There are more people out there whose minds can be changed than just Trump and Clinton voters. And in 2020, there will be new voters, too.

Speaking of studies, believing that an opinion has more popular approval increases support for that opinion. It's called the [bandwagon effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagon_effect). So it is useful to drive home the fact that Trump is not popular and did not get the most votes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Apparently mail-in ballots have to be [manually reviewed](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-california-primary-results-finally-counted-20160710-snap-story.html). I'm not sure why. I'm one state up in Oregon, where it's all by mail and all automated.

There are also a ton of provisional ballots when people go to the wrong voting location, and those take even more time to review. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's important to understand reality for many reasons.

...

For example, when polls show very negative attitudes toward Trump and his policies, some Trump supporters may try to tune out reality by saying "the polls were wrong." But the polls converged on a Clinton lead of about 3%, while her actual lead will be closer to 2%. So the opinion of the people, as measured by calling people and asking their opinion, is not "wrong." We know what the public does and does not support.

It's also important to highlight the level of inequality in the system so as to build support for changing the system. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Legislative bodies throughout the world have unequal representation, like the US Senate. But where the country's leaders are directly elected, there is no similar electoral college body to interlope and redistribute the vote. Even within unequal bodies like the US Senate and European Parliament, all of the voters for a particular seat are given an equal vote for that seat. The same is not true for the US presidency. </TEXT>

If only you cared about the opposite being true.

There are [approximately](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/map_of_the_week/2012/11/presidential_election_a_map_showing_the_vote_power_of_all_50_states.html) 508,000 Californians per electoral vote and 315,000 Utahns per EV, giving Utahns roughly 60% more voting power.

I'm aware of women in a single state, New Jersey, being allowed to vote if they owned land, but only until 1807, when that loophole was closed. (Women's property would conventionally become owned by their husband upon marriage, anyway.) And I'm aware of a single case in Massachusetts. I'm not aware of any such provision in Oregon. There may be information to the contrary, but it seems quite esoteric if so. Regardless, the legitimacy of a government derives from the consent of the governed, including those putatively irresponsible non-property owners. </TEXT>

[Here's an article:](http://www.denverpost.com/2016/09/03/fbi-report-platte-river-network-employee-bleachbit-delete-clinton-e-mails/)

Sometime between March 25 and 31, 2015, the Platte River employee had an Oh expletive moment that the files werent deleted. He told the FBI that he then deleted the Clinton archive mailbox from the PRN server and used BleachBit to delete the exported .PST files he had created on the server system containing Clintons e-mails, according to the FBI report.  ...

 The employee told the FBI in a May 3, 2016 interview that he was aware of the existence of the preservation request and the fact that it meant he should not disturb Clintons e-mail data on the PRN Server.

 Clinton told the FBI she was never deleted nor did she instruct anyone to delete e-mails and was unaware of Platte Rivers deletions from March 2015. </TEXT>

Here's the [four-week moving average](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IC4WSA), which smoothes out any single-week phenomena. As you can see, it is still the lowest in over 40 years. And there is no big leg downward where one state or another reduced their benefits and therefore made them less tempting. That can have an effect, but the sheer magnitude of the decline is simply unexplainable by such factors. This really is a factor of fewer layoffs, as indicated by [this chart of layoffs and discharges](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/JTS1000LDL). </TEXT>

Today, the Republican choice for White House strategist has [some kind of issue with Asian CEOs in Silicon Valley](https://www.engadget.com/2016/11/17/trump-advisor-takes-issue-with-silicon-valleys-asian-ceos/), while a Trump surrogate is [citing the internment of Japanese](https://thinkprogress.org/carl-higbie-trump-muslim-registry-internment-camps-769310d9f9c6) as precedent for creating a Muslim registry.

There are now 12 Asian-American Senators and Representatives currently or soon to serve in Congress. All of them are Democrats, none of them are Republicans. They are Marie Hirono, Tammy Duckworth, Kamala Harris, Robert Scott, Mike Honda, Doris Matsui, Judy Chu, Ami Bera, Tulsi Gabbard, Grace Meng, Mark Takano, and Ted Lieu. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've talked to voters and I know that they have a lot of different, sometimes very esoteric views. But [racial views are way more predictive](http://www.salon.com/2016/11/13/yep-race-really-did-trump-economics-a-data-dive-on-his-supporters-reveals-deep-racial-animosity/) than economic views of which candidate people supported. If it were vice versa, and we concluded that people were drawn to an economic message, there wouldn't be nearly as much resistance to believing that. But because the data shows it was more about race, people resist accepting it.

<TEXT> This was not an election about economic policy. Trump voters did not ignore "Mexicans are rapists," "lock her up," and "complete shutdown of Muslims," they were drawn to it. The chants and t-shirts at Trump rallies weren't "No more NAFTA," they were "TRUMP THAT BITCH." Trump is a gold-plated billionaire or millionaire offering massive tax cuts for other millionaires and billionaires who has no realistic ability to bring back industrial jobs, as the GOP is [already admitting](http://grist.org/briefly/mitch-mcconnell-has-already-admitted-gop-promises-to-out-of-work-coal-miners-wont-come-true/).

The 226k detainers over 4 years are people not in custody who were convicted previously. I didn't lie, I quoted numbers with links that you quibbled with to once again avoid the massive lie about 3 million. If you aren't satisfied that the data presented is appropriate, find data about 3 million that you actually can believe. You act like there might actually be 3 million criminals who are undocumented immigrants. You know how you can prove that? By citing anything to back that up.

<TEXT> There aren't anywhere near that many undocumented immigrants with criminal records, and we already process and remove undocumented immigrants when they are convicted of a crime. In the four-year period of [2008-2012](http://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/310/), about a million detainer notices were issued by ICE. Those with criminal records were prioritized, but there were still only 226,000 with criminal records, and only 86,000 with serious offenses. Criminals are convicted in court. We know who they are. We remove about 180k undocumented immigrants who are convicted each year.

<TEXT> When we talk about criminals, we're talking about people who have been convicted in a court. It's not like we don't know about them.

[Between 2008 and 2012](http://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/310/), ICE issued about a million detainer notices where they wanted to apprehend suspected undocumented immigrants. Of those, only 226,000 had criminal records, 86,000 being serious cases. This was in a four-year period. And those with criminal records were prioritized for detainers, it's not like there were a bunch of criminals that ICE didn't care about.

Most of the annual removals of people with criminal records are people who got a conviction that year and were taken into custody and processed for removal. Remember, criminals are convicted in court. There aren't millions of free-roaming undocumented immigrants being convicted in absentia.

The real numbers are simply nowhere near Trump's massive, baseless, fear-mongering lie about foreign hordes of millions of dangerous bogeymen that he'll protect us from. </TEXT>

<TEXT> *I* actually said it's justified to kill if "you or someone else is inimmediate danger of being seriously injured or killed."

The other commenter was promoting the "reasonable fear" standard, where it's your fear that matters, not an immediate threat of death or injury. "I feared for my life" is a very potent tool for avoiding conviction, but it has a reputation as a get-out-of-jail card that is often abused. I proposed restraint unless there was a real and immediate threat of death or serious injury. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not actually talking to you, I'm talking to the reasonable non-Hitler fans who may be reading. Heritage's logic would deport the white working class voters who gave us Trump, since it's predicated on the non-college educated paying less in taxes and receiving more benefits. (Total college grads voted for Clinton.) They use single-year averaging to avoid how virtually *every* citizen, not just current retirees, will cost a ton in Social Security and Medicare, which undocumenteds will provide a net benefit to by only paying in and not taking out. Heritage also fails to admit that taxes and benefits are a mere fraction of a person's economic impact. Consumer spending is big. It creates jobs by providing the demand for goods and services that businesses require. It's the whole reason why booming populations lead to rising economies, even in poorer countries like China and India. All that spending and employment also increases tax revenue. But again, taxes aren't the only economic benefit from a growing population. </TEXT>

 Anti-Trump demonstrator shot, say @PortlandPolice. @KelseyWattsKPTV says suspect is angry motorist blocked on bridge who fired 5 shots. 

Also, here's what this sub had to say about motorists killing protesters last night, with 18 upvotes:

[Remember, it's not murder if they started it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/5ccpjb/from_ppbs_twitter_due_to_extensive_criminal_and/d9vi4lo/)

Edit, this person says he was only mocking the person he was responding to, who got 95 upvotes for saying a motorist could kill a protester if their vehicle was damaged. I got downvoted for describing the "It's not murder" comment as a justification for roadside killing, with replies to me saying I was calling for too much restraint. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Putting a flawed, polarizing and weak candidate forward by using a rigged system to destroy the democrat candidate with broad and diverse support

Hillary actually got millions more votes than Sanders, and those votes were much more diverse. She had 60%+ approval until everyone falsely reported she was email-guilty, and never recovered after it was found that they had no case. If security services want to criminalize a candidate without having a case, they can do so with anyone. Sanders? The FBI would just leak that he's under investigation for profiting from embezzlement and fraud at Burlington College. Agents would continually leak to Fox News that he's about to be indicted. Reporters would speculate about indictments against Sanders whenever Trump screwed up, for "balance." Russia would hack his associates' emails, releasing them in a drip drip drip and distorting them on RT, with Assange constantly alleging the *really* big, *really* damaging one was always around the corner. These abuses of US and foreign power can be used to sink literally anyone. Criminalizing opponents is a preferred tool of autocrats because it works. Legitimize it at your peril. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Comey's speech was not even remotely resembling the FBI's report, which came quietly on the Friday before a three-day weekend. It determined the use of non-State email to be common throughout State through multiple Secretaries and administrations. Her staff was given immunity in exchange for testifying about Clinton so that the FBI could get dirt on her without the staff needing to worry about incriminating themselves, but they still got nothing. The FBI found that she gave all of her emails to her lawyers who turned over anything with subject lines or search hits indicating they were work related. That resulted in a lot of false positives and negatives but was legal. The server was put into storage at a third-party company, unwiped. Much later, an employee at that company became concerned that the server hadn't been wiped and wiped it. He was given immunity to reveal who told him to wipe it. He said he acted on his own under the belief that it should have been done much earlier to comply with security protocol. The AG is irrelevant to the FBI's finding that there was no case. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because America is the oldest standing modern democracy. You can quibble about partial democratic bodies under monarchies or other older forms, but they've all since modified their systems, and in doing so, studied other democracies, including the world's most prominent one. Other democracies expanded the franchise to women and minorities before we eventually did, but they were nevertheless formed after the US. There's a common fallacy that because America is a republic, it's not also a democracy. It is both. Every democratic country votes for representatives who pass legislation. </TEXT>

You say this avoids dictatorships, but it has actually resulted in a man who vowed to jail his political opponent, pledged to sue his critics and change the laws to make it easier for him to prevail, said he alone can protect us, fanned fears of other races and religions, etc., because he was able to become president without needing broad and diverse support, just a narrow minority.

Still, recounts would be another 2016 curve ball to make this just all so fitting.

Edit: As someone else has pointed out, Michigan is within recount territory, too. Again, it's all unlikely to change the outcome, but recounts are just another unstable factor to make this year evermore ridiculous. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Obama would likely have fired him first. He abused America's security services to install a strongman, publicly criminalizing a candidate he never had a case against while staying mum on the other. Legitimize that at your peril. Any candidate can be sunk this way. Bernie? Ominous innuendo for a year and a half that he's being investigated for profiting from embezzlement and fraud at Burlington College, agents "leaking" to Fox News that he could be indicted any minute, the rest of the media feeding the fire any time Trump does something wrong, for "balance." Russia hacking his associates' emails and distorting them on RT in a drip drip drip, Assange constantly warning the big, explosive one is just around the corner. This abuse of US and foreign powers is democracy-ending. They are the tactics of despots. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Republicans have been farting ominous innuendo about Hillary being a criminal for 30 years, always promoting that she's going to jail for ... something. There are never charges because it's not real, it's politics. Anyone could have simply reviewed case law, [as Politico eventually did](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/hillary-clinton-prosecution-past-cases-221744), and realized there wasn't going to be a case about emails. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You legitimize this at your own risk. Security services working to publicly criminalize a candidate they don't have a case against while staying silent on the other is not acceptable. One-sided kompromat by a foreign power that the other campaign is secretly communicating with is not acceptable. Bernie Sanders and any other candidate is vulnerable to this. The FBI would be perfectly free to leak ominously that Bernie Sanders is under investigation for profiting off of embezzlement at Burlington College for a year and a half. The media would then speculate about Bernie Sanders and an embezzlement indictment every time Trump was in trouble, for "balance," while Russia leaks staffers' emails distortingly presented by RT. Such abuses by US and foreign powers threaten our democracy and cannot be accepted. </TEXT>

How do you know this?

Because minor children are not guilty of any crime by simply living with the parents who take care of them.

No. I'd say we're making the others pay and spend years waiting, too. </TEXT>

Edit: Comments are locked, but to reply to the commenter below, there were plenty of incidents of white people attacking minorities in this election, as well as vice versa, but I never had to fear that I myself as a white guy would be painted as violent because of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is nothing comparable to the fairness doctrine here. That's just Trump gobbledygook. We regulate phone lines so everyone has access to each other regardless of carrier. We regulate broadcast frequencies so all stations can be heard.  Ensuring that all people have equal access to all the internet, and that all the internet has equal access to all people, does not regulate content. It ensures equal access. Also, the FCC is the executive branch body that enacted net neutrality, which is why the president of the executive branch announced it. </TEXT>

[Gallup said that.](http://content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/POLL/tt3qxs_ku0kmbi7lxjc0kq.png)

 Now your saying that this article gave her historic unfavorables, over a year and a half ago?

That is what the numbers show. It is a clear, unambiguous cliff. Then the FBI decided to cry high and low that it was secretly investigating her for a year and a half when any reporter could just review case history and realize [they had no case](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/hillary-clinton-prosecution-past-cases-221744). Then Comey tried to justify himself by [abusing his power](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/james-comeys-abuse-of-power/2016/07/06/7799d39e-4392-11e6-8856-f26de2537a9d_story.html) with an unprecedented, sanctimonious attack on a political candidate he had no case against. And, of course, he stuck his ego on the scales one more time 11 days before the election, only correcting himself after 20 million early votes had come in. All along you had one-sided hacking to keep pretending there might be some horrible crime just lurking around the corner, the big scandal that was surely going to drop any minute.

It was garbage from beginning to end. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First, remember that Democrats just won the most votes for the sixth presidential race out of seven.

Also, just as everyone played the "she's equally bad" game with Hillary, they would have done so with Sanders. "He's a shouty, bad-tempered, dangerous extremist!" the media and the GOP would say. "He wants a new NATO with Russia, they're both Putin's puppet!" And just as they falsely criminalized her, they would have investigated and criminalized Sanders' alleged profiting from embezzlement at Burlington College and scandalized his refusal to release more than a summary of one year of taxes. Republicans only held their fire on Sanders to rough up Clinton.

Remember, Clinton had over 60% approval before email gate. Don't underestimate the ability of criminalization to sink a candidate, especially when assisted  by the nation's security forces and the media's insistence that both sides are the same. Security forces criminalizing opponents is a favored tactic of autocrats for a reason. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The writing will be on the wall well before then, but the winner won't be declared by the news networks until states totalling 270 electoral votes have been called for one candidate.

For example, by 7:30, Florida, Virginia, Ohio and North Carolina will all close. [Put any three of those states in Clinton's column](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/clinton-trump-paths-to-win-election.html) and you see what happens: Trump has no path to victory. News outlets only wait till 270 to keep viewers watching longer, and to not get accused of depressing turnout in Western states that haven't finished voting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Those party affiliations being changed happened to both Democrats and Republicans. The reason appeared to be that people [updated their address](http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/03/26/mvd-error-might-have-kicked-arizona-voters-out-parties/82278442/) and didn't choose a party, thinking they didn't have to because they were already with a party.

Maricopa County, where the long lines happened, has four Republicans and one Democrat on the Board of Governors. The Democrat is Steve Gallardo, who [endorsed Sanders](http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/bernie-sanders-gets-more-endorsements-from-arizona-latino-leaders-8040287).

I only point this out because it was common to hear that Hillary rigged the primary states that she won. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Oregon ballot returns: Dems ahead of GOP by bigger margin than 2008 or 2012 so far </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-02 14:14:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> According to early Oregon ballot return figures, 46.4% of statewide ballots returned so far are from registered Democrats, compared to 31.8% from Republicans. That D +14.6% margin so far compares to D +8.2% in 2012 and D +12.7% in 2008.

If you calculate the vote split between just Democrats and Republicans each year, it was D +14.4% in 2008, D +10.8% in 2012, and is D +18.6% so far in 2016.

The actual results in the Oregon presidential race have been D +16.4% in 2008 and D +12.1% in 2012.

But the people who vote early aren't necessarily representative of those who vote in the final week. For example, in other states, the earliest absentee ballots tend to come from an older demographic, while last-minute ones skew younger. But in-person voting on election day tends to skew more Republican than early voting. I'm not aware of a pattern for Oregon ballot returns.

Here are links to the numbers, plus math:

  **[2016](http://www.electproject.org/early_2016)** (to date)  
  D: 339,586 / 732,179 = 46.4%  
  R: 233,083 / 732,179 = 31.8%  
  Margin: D +14.6%  
  Two-party split: 59.3%40.7% (D +18.6)

  **[2012](http://sos.oregon.gov/elections/Documents/statistics/november-2012-voter-participation.pdf)**  
  D: 752,722 / 1,820,507 = 41.3%  
  R: 602,090 / 1,820,507 = 33.1%  
  Margin: D +8.2%  
  Two-party split: 55.6%44.4% (D +10.8%)  

  **[2008](http://sos.oregon.gov/elections /Documents/statistics/participation-stats-11-2008.pdf)**  
  D: 929,741 / 1,845,251 = 50.4%  
  R: 695,677 / 1,845,251 = 37.7%  
  Margin: D +12.7%  
  Two-party split: 57.2%42.8% (D +14.4%) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand that you're angry, but swearing at me is counterproductive, as are snotty claims that your opponent must not know things that are unimpressively basic.

As the chart indicates, the current blocking of bills is a historical aberration. For example, [filibustering has skyrocketed](https://tcf.org/assets/images/blog_images/2013-11-21-filibuster-reform-updated.png), and the filibuster itself has mutated into something new. The filibuster used to simply ensure that the minority's views could be heard. Senators used to speak for hours to block a bill like Strom Thurmond's record 24-hour blockade of the Civil Rights Act of 1957, and then when the filibuster ended, the normal simple-majority vote took place  no supermajority required. The filibuster was simply about ensuring the minority was heard.

Now, we have this weird mutation of Senate norms where virtually all legislation requires a 60-vote supermajority, as if the Senate is "the chamber that requires a 60 percent supermajority." That was never the case. It's an aberration. And now simple motions to proceed are being blocked, meaning *no debate takes place at all.* We've gone through the looking glass to where a filibuster ensures no voices get heard, instead of ensuring all voices get heard. That's literally the opposite of a filibuster.

And that's hardly all. The bottlenecking of routine judicial appointments has gone absurd. Just the difference from [Bush to Obama](http://www.pfaw.org/sites/default/files/images/Average_Days_Chart.jpg) is extraordinary, and if you recall, Republicans were apoplectic at the much shorter judicial approval wait times under Bush. Imagine the outraged "Up or down vote!" chanting that would be going on today if this stall-everything approach was happening under a Republican.

Other tactics, like where a single senator places a hold on legislation or a nominee, have gone off the charts, and now those holds are indefinite instead of temporary. One ambassadorial nominee even [died waiting](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/282448-obama-nominee-died-after-waiting-two-years-for-confirmation) over two years. There was no actual objection to her. Sen. Cotton just wanted to personally punish the president by blocking an old college friend of Obama's until she died of cancer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your first paragraph acknowledges that bills are being blocked. You can come up with ad hoc criticism of any bill imaginable, so "show me a bill I can't criticize" is a pointless challenge.
Your second paragraph claims I'm wrong to say bills can't get passed, because Congress is still naming post offices and recognizing Rosa Parks' birthday, and sometimes during an election year you can shame Republicans into passing Zika funding without a poison pill because Florida is a swing state. But there are clearly many bills that can't get passed, hence the dropoff. </TEXT>

 Whether it was becoming the first Republican Senator to co-sponsor the Equality Act, co-sponsoring a bill to help schools combat anti-LGBT bullying or supporting marriage equality, Senator Kirk has demonstrated time and again that he believes in full federal equality, said HRC President Chad Griffin.

They also criticized Mark Kirk and called on him to [withdraw his comments:](https://www.twitter.com/bllorenz/status/792027308743856128)

Mark Kirk's comments were wrong and inappropriate. HRC endorsed Senator Kirk based on the strength of his record on LGBTQ equality, and while that remains unchanged, we believe he should rescind his comments immediately. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A big part of this are the debates, but that doesn't explain why this didn't happen in 2004, 2008 or 2012. Fox News underplayed the "Trump tape" and the aftermath, so interested viewers had to look elsewhere. Roger Ailes is gone, so maybe Fox lacks his instinct for what viewers want. And then there's Trump. Trump just isn't as broadly popular with Republicans as Bush, McCain or Romney. And some Trump supporters (including Donald Trump) are really upset at Megyn Kelly. It's been a long time since I followed daily cable ratings closely, so I can't tell if her numbers have suffered much. She still beats the competition. Right-wing sites seem to think she's suffering for her liberal sins, though. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Multnomah County's ballots are confusingly aligned </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-21 04:17:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Quick, is [this oval](http://imgur.com/LxSwpbD) for Democrat Mark Callahan or Republican Eric Navickas?

It is, in fact, for Mark Callahan, but he's a Republican, not a Democrat. Most of us will figure this out with the [context](http://imgur.com/kfLYqWFl) of the rest of the ovals and names, which I cropped out of the first image. But that requires an extra bit of pattern recognition and reasoning that could slip up, say, an elderly voter. It's hardly the most challenging puzzle, but history shows a confusing ballot alignment can cause real trouble.

In Florida's 2000 election mess, Palm Beach County's infamous ["butterfly ballot"](http://imgur.com/6RXnujE) had party tickets alternating on the left and right of a column of holes, with arrows pointing to the right holes for each party. But this liberal Florida county, with a significant Jewish community, ended up giving Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan [three times the votes](http://www.salon.com/2000/11/09/florida_vote/) of any other county, an unlikely result for an ultra-conservative minor-party candidate repeatedly accused of anti-Semitism.

It only takes a few accidental votes to tip a close race. And while you can't prevent all voter mistakes, Multnomah County can improve the ballot design next time. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Pixel looks like a hit on Google Trends </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-12 21:18:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Searches aren't sales, but according to [Google Trends](https://www.google.com/trends/explore?date=all q=pixel,iphone,ipad,apple%20watch,apple%20tv), Pixel searches are currently just shy of where iPhone searches were at launch, as well as where iPad searches were at launch and where iPad searches are at present, while the Pixel is way ahead of the Apple Watch and Apple TV. On this scale, Pixel searches were previously a flat line, so this jump is phone-related. Also, these lines are relative to total Google search traffic, and there was a lot less search traffic in 2007, which suggests that on an absolute measure, there are more Pixel searches now than there were then. Contrarily, Apple users search a lot with Siri now, reducing their representation in the more recent data.

Pixel searches tower over [this collection](https://www.google.com/trends/explore?date=all q=pixel,galaxy%20s7,htc%20one,moto%20g,galaxy%20s4) of past and present popular Android phones, with the exception of the standout Galaxy S4, which is the best-selling Android of all time. The Pixel is almost equal to the peak of the S4. One advantage the Pixel has in the searches, though, is no version number to specify or not specify.

If you compare [single-word phone-related searches](https://www.google.com/trends/explore?date=all q=pixel,galaxy,lg,htc,motorola), and subtract prior non-phone search levels for other meanings of "pixel" and "galaxy," it looks like Pixel phones are getting just about 40% of the searches for all Galaxy products combined, 60% of LG searches, and significantly more searches than HTC or Motorola. (LG makes a lot more than phones, of course).

Maybe the most important comparison for Google is [Nexus](https://www.google.com/trends/explore?date=all q=pixel,nexus). Pixel is already ahead of the Nexus launch hype, and it's not even out yet. It's got a ways to go before it reaches the peak of the Nexus 7, but it's way above where Nexus is now.

Searches and sales aren't the same thing, and this could just be a spike that soon subsides, but this all seems promising. </TEXT>
