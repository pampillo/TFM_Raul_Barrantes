<TEXT> 
Automation has taken low skill labor away not free trade.  Complaining about them not adjusting by getting trained to do something else is similar to complaining about farmers not changing when the industrial revolution took off.

I feel for people facing addiction but at some point they do make a choice to continue doing heroin.

Wal-Mart is bad but they choose to shop there. If they don't want their local stores run out of business then they need to be willing to pay a little more. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The way I see it is they voted for a bully because he told them he would reverse the clock for them and they were happy others would get hurt. They are only upset now because it turns out he lied to them and will hurt them too. This doesn't make me feel empathy.

Also I grew up around a lot of these people and I saw a lot of their problems were self inflicted. I also noticed how exclusive and rigid these towns were. That experience made me very cynical towards them. 

I used to have a little empathy but even having seen the issues rural towns have this election killed what little empathy remained.

Also I'd avoid using the term "globalist". Conspiracy theorists frequently use it as a way of saying Jewish. 

I'll link two articles one is about the problems facing rural areas that takes a more empathetic approach and talks about rural brain drain and how it is impacting these communities and the other is about the problems with the mindset in rural areas and who they blame. The chronicle one seems to touch more on what you are arguing for. I agree with the problems they bring up but I'm not sure their solutions would work.

As for the section about minorities. I was referring to minorities in the US not being shut out from jobs that they used to be shut out from.

Since you also seem to blame free trade; automation is what took these jobs away and the death of coal is due to the free market, natural gas is a better option. </TEXT>

There was another story I read last year about a small town in Maine that refused to open a call center because it wasn't something they did in that town. A lot of rural towns think they need to have these masculine jobs for locals to work at.

It is interesting that Clinton seems to be the only mainstream person who pushes for rural areas to get technology infrastructure. It is keeping companies from expanding into these areas and until it gets resolved you will see these places continue to lose population  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Former S.C. Police Officer Pleads Guilty In Shooting Of Walter Scott 


http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/05/02/526580300/former-s-c-police-officer-pleads-guilty-in-shooting-of-walter-scott

The AP reports that Slager facing a possible sentence of life in prison and $250,000 in fines, but that prosecutors "prosecutors are proposing a sentence based on federal guidelines for a second-degree murder conviction, which recommend more than 20 years."

This was the part I was referring to. Is that from before the plea deal?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As someone that lost my mind about Tabor last night and really wanted heavy dline investment I imagine they decided db's is more pressing than pass rush. They must think that our dline is fine but we need an upgrade at DB. Considering Austin was a db coach he likely knows what to look for.  

I notice the lb we drafted late is good in coverage  </TEXT>

Their population is disappearing and jobs are not opening in those areas. It's cold but the election has given me a cynical response of "let them fail"

<TEXT> I transplanted away from a small town to a large metro area but I think you are underselling the difficulty of doing something like that in modern times. That was why I brought up telecommuting. Even though it seems like it would help engage rural Americans in work it did the opposite and massively benefited cities.

I guess the question is how do you spur growth in areas where most of the population is older or willing to leave. Do you encourage them to relocate? We used to encourage people to do that for work

<TEXT> Telecommuting has not made towns grow. It's only been a boon for cities. So why would someone want to uproot themselves just to bust their ass to make an area they have no connection to better? 

Edit: also unless they are independently wealthy this carries great personal risk as small towns did back Trump partly due to desperation. They don't have opportunities and those who can leave frequently do. While a lot of it is self inflicted it still is ignoring that these towns don't have a lot going for them </TEXT>

Interesting enough is that longer farming equipment came from non migrants working in the field. 


As far as crime.

<TEXT> The only good part about this election was that it killed any minor empathy I had for small towns. 

I've thought for years that we're better off not shipping them money to prop up their dying communities. But this election proved it. It's best for the country to let them fail. 

And the reason you got left behind is because your towns refuse to adapt to any change  </TEXT>

Washington has potential but he is still a reserve player who needs to prove himself.

Actually it was a running back.

The alt-right basement-dwellers and sundry knuckleheads beamed that Trump was going to be a nationalist, and that he would give the boot to coastal elitists, moderates, and Ivy League snoots. 

Edit 
That closing line

What Limbaugh and the rest of Trumps admirers missed is that it wasnt NATO and the Chi-Coms and Enrique Pea Nieto on the other side of the negotiating table getting hornswoggled. It was them.

<TEXT> This is what they've voted for. They constantly shouted about free trade and never looked that automation is what has taken low skill labor away.

 They never sought training to be a part of the changes to the economy. Instead they've turned to conspiracy theories and shouted that the factories will come back. The harsh truth that they need to seek retraining and potentially move to an urbanized area is something they never wanted to listen to.

So how is it not their fault? </TEXT>

Specifically this line

My childhood was different from Kevins, but I grew up in Kentucky, live in a rural county in Tennessee, and have seen the challenges of the white working-class first-hand. Simply put, Americans are killing themselves and destroying their families at an alarming rate. No one is making them do it. The economy isnt putting a bottle in their hand. Immigrants arent making them cheat on their wives or snort OxyContin. Obama isnt walking them into the lawyers office to force them to file a bogus disability claim. </TEXT>

These folks are completely invested in this narrative now and nothing is going to convince then otherwise until they see the catastrophe it reaps. 

This is why I think the best way forward is to let small towns reap that catastrophe. Let them experience their bad decisions and stop having cities bail them out </TEXT>

<TEXT> I grew up in a rural community and the experience has not endeared them to me. I don't blame government ignoring them as much as people just left either for opportunity elsewhere or for the culture of a city.

 I think the towns reason for existing is diminishing. They were agricultural but most of that work is done by automation now. They are slowly being cannibalized by cities and still take a larger amount than they give in revenue.  

I find that we act like it's such a tragedy that low skill labor left small towns meanwhile we tell people in the inner city looking for work to pull up their bootstraps and get trained or move somewhere. I don't know why we don't say the same to small towns  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it also depends on how long those regions will matter. Rural states are hemorrhaging population due to rural brain drain. Trump policies will accelerate that if they go through  

Edit: also 08 was several years ago. Rural areas have been drifting even further right in recent years. I think a lot of this has to do with younger people who are able fleeing small towns for the coasts and regional cities  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Are we talking just 08 or the years following? His popularity suffered in small towns especially through his second term.

08 had a wave follow Obama backed up on the housing market collapse. The Midwest has also trended towards conservatism in recent years probably due to a lot of people leaving the area

<TITLE> How similar is the 2014 Chicago Bears defense to the 2013 Detroit Lions defense? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-07 18:08:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was thinking about this last night. In 2013 we had an underperforming defensive line which was still probably the best part of our defense. This year Chicago's defensive line is above average and seems to be the best part of their defense. The two secondaries that are being compared are both awful, the difference is that the 2013 lions secondary had bad play from cornerbacks and decent play from one of our safeties (Quin). The 2014 bears defense has average-above average play from their safeties and prior to injury was getting decent play from their cornerbacks. The only large difference that I can see is that we had 2 very good linebackers on our 2013 squad while the 2014 bears squad has had abysmal linebacker play, which I think has been the biggest cause for their problems. Anyways these were some of my thoughts last night and I wondered if anyone wanted to talk about them. </TEXT>

There's this thread going around to sign up in to write a prediction on each team's season, /u/DollFinJesus came up with the idea, they're doing one per day. Currently there's no one signed up to do one for the lions. I was wondering if anyone here was interested in committing to do this or if we would want to do it by committee via submitting one after debating it as a sub, similar to how the mock drafts were done a few months back.

Edit: It looks like /u/Bobby_Marks2 signed up. </TEXT>

Plenty of Bad History in the comments here, including the classic "The Civil War was over States Rights!" for anyone interested

Edit: An example of the classy attitudes in the thread 
Do you really think that it was fought over slavery? Or how about Northerners invading the South? Do you think they would have just let them come into their homes without defending themselves? The South was fighting for states rights. NOT slavery. 

And another one

That statistics looks at families.... 1/3 of Southerns were part of families that own slaves.
The actual percentage of individuals, that owned slaves, was less than 5% in the south.
Obviously, slavery was a huge part of southern life... but really, most slaves were owned by a few people. And when you look at people who own more than 2 slaves... you are talking about the top 3% on the population. And more than 10 slaves... top 1%.

<TITLE> Quote of bravery by a commentator to the Libertarian Party page on Facebook </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-02-10 13:52:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Here's the racist's quote "Libertarianism rests on the principle of "ME! ME! ME!". Selfishness, ignorance, and treason run rampant in the "Liberty" Movement if you can even call it that. Libertarians advocate outright slavery to the Jewish banking cartel comprised of the Rothschilds through deregulation. Regulation is meant to keep the greed of the people who have started nearly every war in history in check.

For a Jew, greed is his 2nd nature. Wherever there is human misery there will be a Jew making money. There's a reason these good for nothing rats have been kicked out of 120 countries and counting. There's a reason why he even Stalin wanted to rid his nation of these useless, parasitic rats once and for all. But the Jews killed him before he could finish the job.

The founders of Libertarianism are Jews. Therefore, Libertarianism is fundamentally rooted in avarice, predatory capitalism, war, and famine. It is a foolish notion entirely, and just proves how effective Jewish control of the media has been.

We do not need to limit the power of the state to solve the problems which plague society. We need only to eliminate the Jewish presence within it and kick these good for nothing Jews out of our society. Nationalizing Jewish banks and bank accounts would alleviate not eliminate our national debt but wipe out inequality for Jews are the ones hoarding the wealth of society." </TEXT>
