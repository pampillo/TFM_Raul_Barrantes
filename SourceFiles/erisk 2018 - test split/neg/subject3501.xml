<TEXT> Three high rise builders were sitting on top of a high rise eating lunch. The first builder opens up his lunch pail and says "fuck man, if I get a turkey sandwich one more time I'm gonna jump off this building and kill myself". The second builder opens up his lunch box and says "Jesus, if I get a polish sausage again, I'll join you and jump off this building and kill myself".  The third worker opens his lunch box and says "God damnit, if I get potato pancakes again, I'll join you two and kill myself as well".

The next day at lunch the first worker opens his lunch box shows the other guys a turkey sandwich and jumps and kills himself.  The second worker opens his lunchbox, shows the remaining worker his polish sausage and jumps off the building and kills himself.  The third worker opens his lunch and its potato pancakes, he throws the lunchbox off the building and jumps off and kills himself.  

About a week later at one of the funerals the wife of the first worker says "God had I known he wanted something other than a turkey sandwich, I would have made him something else!" The wife of the second worker says "oh me too, had I known he had grown tired of polish sausage I could have made him anything else!"  The third wife says "Stupid fuck, he makes his own lunch." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ironically it was because I got a terrible massage from the prior therapist and was comped a massage with her. Our paths had actually crossed 10+ times in our lives as we've gotten to know each other better we started talking about places we've been. She used to shop in my store when I was a store manager, concerts we both attended even skating rinks as children. We spent the next year talking once or twice a month when I would come in. There was always a connection, it was innocent, but it was there and quite strong.  Facebook, the creepy thing that it is decided to let me know that I might know her and told me I should probably friend her. This was a year or so after I started coming in.  I obviously let her know about it and she told me I should probably friend her.  I one night just happened to ask if she wanted to grab dinner and a drink, honestly just assuming it would be as friends as I had no idea she had the feels and she had no clue I had the feels.  Clearly we were both wrong.  Hands down, the happiest I've been in my life since I've been with her.  We've got a daughter incoming in April.    </TEXT>
