<TEXT> [Early on in my twenties](https://www.reddit.com/user/subject3600/submitted), after my two years of college, I joined a contracting crew and got out of Alabama for a while. They didn't mind a woman joining up, long as I pulled my weight, but I cut all my hair off for good measure and stopped wearing makeup. Most of the men thought me a lesbian and I quickly became just one of the guys. 

Our first and my last job was out Oklahoma way in a tiny town between Arnett and Seiling. We were to be there a month but rain interrupted our work on day three, and the foreman gave us an early weekend with pay. Can't do much when the dirt becomes mud and the wood swells. 

The guys wanted to hit a strip club but I'd seen small town offerings in the past and begged for something else, so we went hunting. Down the road, a cattle trail led to a ghost town that backed up on woods. According to a couple locals, no one watched the place, and we could hunt sans permits. It wasn't a strip club, so I agreed.
We got a late start due to two of the guys (the ones with the rifle) spending too much time at the bar and not waking until two in the afternoon. Counting drive time, we didn't hit Ghost Town, USA, until nearly four. 

The guys brought a cooler and too much beer and another brought his Rottweiler, a gorgeous one hundred and ten pound beast just itching to tree something.

Sure, most of us spent a lot of our time drinking, but I stopped there early and the guy with the dog stayed teetotal, being a responsible gun-toting Oakie. 

The day passed and besides a couple pot shots at overweight squirrels (all of which we missed,) nothing turned up. It was as the shadows lengthened, that long yards ahead the underbrush shuddered. We let the Rotty loose and he thundered off to drive out our prey. There was a hint of antler as the dog gave chase. 
We all saw the deer, all of us, clear as the darkening day. Completely sober, the guy with the gun lined up his shot and fired, taking extra care to put his sight clearly on the deer and not his Rotty. I stress again, we all saw that deer.

As the gun blast echoed around the trees, the forest fell eerily still.  We went to nab our catch, but what we found breaks the number one rule of storytelling. 

He killed the dog. 

Now, there's no possible way he couldve hit that dog. Absolutely none. The antlers were under his sight, yet there the poor dog lay, bleeding out into the forest floor. There was no trace of the deer, no hoof prints, or broken growth.

Spooked, we decided to book it out of the trees, but he wouldn't leave the Rotty, even when we promised to come back for it at full light.

Somethingll get to him. We take him with us now. 

Each guy hefted the dog by a leg, and I took the rifle. The shadows had grown deep enough for us to break out the flashlights. We hoofed it towards the truck, the dog leaving a bloody trail behind us. 

Halfway out, the trees casting darkness down into strange shapes that made me jumpy, a lady appeared out of nowhere. I raised the rifle without thinking. 

Don't shoot her, one of the guys said and reached over to push the muzzle to the ground. 

There's no reason for her to be out here! And after what happened with the dog

Where you headed, miss? one of the guys called to the stranger.

 I stared her down. She was very pale, with long waves of red hair hanging around her face and shoulders. She looked...untamed. 

I know my way, she replied, and began to move past us.

 It's getting dark, another guy said and held out his flashlight. You can have this to help you see. 

I know my way, she insisted and brushed past us. Her voice was silky smooth, and the hairs on my neck raised even more.

I started to say something when a susurrus hit my ears. The rustling seemed to echo from all directions, but only the underbrush before us moved.

Snakes. Legions of them slithered from the growth and over our feet, an unending tide of long bodies followed the strange woman and all of us remained frozen until the serpents passed, many, many moments later.

Be glad you didn't shoot her, someone muttered, and I agreed.

We sped up, double-timing it back to our pick-ups, stashing in the dog in the back and squealing tires outta the ghost town. I swear, as we peeled out, eyes followed us from the supposedly empty, abandoned houses. 

There was a gas station some miles away, and we stopped to gather our wits and refuel. The cashier inside eyed me before asking what was wrong. Look like you seen the devil.

I shrugged, but she insisted on pulling the story from my tongue.

Afterwards, she sucked in air tasting my tale, before nodding resolutely. 

Nah, we don't go up there. You messed in witches territory. Lucky you got out at all. She wouldnt say much else.

<TEXT> You can help me. Please. Hear me out. It's the only way to save us all.

[They targeted the most vulnerable.](https://www.reddit.com/user/subject3600/submitted) They gave it five days, but it only took one. One day to feed the masses nanites disguised as pixie stick sugar atop a sugary concoction, the sour topping hiding the metallic tang, though the mango flavor probably helped.

The population was infected, and they didn't know it. Yet.

But I would make sure to save humanity even if I had to eradicate every last unicorn-infested person myself.

Damn Starbucks, damn it to hell.

The Northstar Initiative wasn't what they promised. A pledge to return to Seattle roots and simplify the menu sounds great until you realize how they planned to accomplish that. Brain washing customers with an infection of microscopic brain bugs so people would only want the original menu?! Devious. Evil. I pledged to save you all.

Not that I don't prefer plain coffee, but mind control is heinous.

It took me a while to realize it, but with extensive research to unravel the web Starbucks had woven, it became so clear.

The Unicorn Frappuccino was a mind control scheme hidden behind the Northstar Initiative. Starbucks must be stopped. It must all be stopped.

My first rescue attempt was a young woman I knew from work. She had posted a selfie while drinking the Frap on Instagram. I had to help her. Jessica didn't deserve to be mind controlled. No one did.

She protested when I took her from the parking garage at our office, but soon I'd have her back to normal.

I'd prepared the spare room. Blocks of foam and plastic wrap. Sanitized blades and styptic powder. Bandages and morphine.

I'd untwist the monster from her spinal column. I would save her.

It took long hours. She stopped screaming twenty minutes after the first incision, the brain-controlling nanomachines paralyzing her.

It was for the best. I had to dig deep into her neck. I can only imagine the pain she'd have felt if Jess remained conscious.

But all my extensive research and knowledge couldn't make up for human biology and the super powered nano-bugs invented by someone much smarter than me.

Jessica shuddered to a halt before I could remove the infection.

I laid her to rest in my backyard and pledged to try again and again until I saved everyone.

The cops had other plans. The camera in the parking garage and the fresh turned earth in my backyard has spelled out my doom in the form of an APB aired over the radio while I was taking my next rescue. They swept through my house, finding the sound-proofed and bloody room, and Jessica's ruined body.

I'll hole up in this motorcourt hotel, and try to save more, but I may be stopped before I can achieve my goals. That's where you come in.

Before they find me, I wanted to warn you all. Finish what I tried to start. Save the world. [Save yourself!](http://facebook.com/subject3600writing) </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Death took my time a lot differently than I thought she would.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/560k6z/things_my_grandmother_taught_me/) And I didnt understand until recently.

As a child, my dreams were strange, but the absolute weirdest of them were the nights I walked empty hallways, museums, malls, and streets. I would travel along alone, shuffling through different venues until the air would grow cold, and my breath became visible in the chill.

I would know they were coming, and Id fall to the ground, to my knees, and tuck my head into my arms, cannonball style, so that all I could see would be a small amount of the ground around me. Thats when they would come; a multitude of people walking by, some slow, others in a hurry, all different. I could only see the shoes, their ankles or hemlines. Some wore boots, heels, flats, tennis shoes, all in various stages of wear.

I didnt know who they were, but as long as I stayed tucked into the ground, they continued past. No one stopped to ask a little girl what she was doing.

Now I know, I was was walking the dead road.

Waves of people streamed past me. At times, Id try to count, but the dream world doesnt work in order, so Id quickly drift off, or lose track.

Feet would shuffle along, and while I was curious about the faces of those passing me by, I somehow knew looking would bring ruin as I would be forced join their trek.

I acted as a beacon, lighting the purgatory, until enough souls found my light and followed.

Where I fell, just beyond a door would open, and they would trudge past to the ever after.

As a child, burrowed into my knees, daring peeks of shoes, and little else, these dreams were oddly terrifying. Alone, surrounded by walkers that I was too afraid to look at, I only buried my head deeper and waited for the multitudes to pass.

Sometimes my entire night would be eaten by these travelers, while other dreams were short, only a dozen or so shoes.

These night time adventures eventually faded some years after they began.

I didnt miss the dreams, almost didnt notice when they stopped, and as such, I cannot pinpoint the exact date of their disappearance.

Im only reminded now of them, because these dreams are back.

Last night, I walked an empty aquarium. The tanks held water, rocks, and myriad decorations, but no life swam behind the glass, and no people milled around to see the displays.

I was alone with the blue lights and dark corners.

It was silent, no buzzing of electricity, no music, no sound.

I walked in a vacuum, turning corners, passing through the trails, and by the merch stands. Not a soul could I find.

And then the air grew cold.

At twenty-seven, curling into a ball seems harder than when I was young. Theres more of me to compress.

Sitting and dragging my knees to my face, I wrapped my arms around my head and dared to peek at what came by me.

Droves and droves and droves of people, footsteps thunderous in the silence, echoing off the too-still water, reverberating along the empty paths.

They flocked to me, a glowing guide in the dim blue aquarium light. I felt like there was a backlog of people rushing by me, as if all the years I escaped this dream left stranded the people who passed me now.

The door opened beyond me, and they surged through. Hours passed or so it felt, before the crowd lessened. I saw a pair of Martens step by, and then it fell silent again.

In the emptiness, silk brushed skin, the noise of it deafening. I felt a tug on my arm, and saw little feet in ballet slippers with pink tights. I dared not look, but the child persisted, pulling my arm up and forward. My eyes shut tight, I let myself be dragged me to my feet. The little dancer giggled, and the hair on my neck stood, but still I dared not look.

Delicate fingers gripped my wrist, leading me forward. I felt the light of the door as we drew closer.

No, I choked out. No.

A child shouldnt have so much strength. She pulled me into the light, and the ground fell from my feet.

Long moments passed before I landed in what felt like a grassy expanse. I felt around, but found no other person. Opening one eye, and then the other, I took in the empty field I stood in. Wild flowers grew numerous for miles. The sun was warm overhead.

And before me, Death stood once more. Her smile dripped over her lips, as her inky eyes took me in. Her wings were neatly tucked away, the pinions lost in the tall grass. She beckoned with a hand to me. 

I shook my head. Youve taken your years in my dreams. I owe you nothing else.

Death bared teeth, the smile growing to swallow me. You pledged three years, and time does not pass truly in dreams. I have made of you a reaper, now and always, and your service will stretch across your life. Will you serve me willingly?

You will take no more than I promised. I wish to wake in my bed.

Death laughed, sandpaper on concrete. You will walk the dead road each month, whether you will it or not, and I will have my souls. Youll find peace when youre finally mine. Such is a reapers tale, and so it will be for you.

The sheets were damp with sweat and twisted when I woke, the pillows on the floor, and the dog relegated to his own bed because of my thrashing.

If Death spoke true, the time I owe will never pass, and I will walk the souls to the after for the rest of my life.

So long as I do not look, I will not join them. But the urge grows.

And everyone walks the dead road sooner or later. I will see your shoes as they pass me, when it is your time. Follow the beacon, and pass quietly. [I have no wish to join you yet.](https://www.facebook.com/subject3600writing) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Haunted Fridge for Sale </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-18 14:24:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [I knew better than to buy a used fridge.](https://www.reddit.com/user/subject3600/submitted/) Used things hardly ever work, ya know? But I was a bit desperate. Buying the house itself was so last minute, but my lease was coming up and my dog deserved a fenced yard and God knows interest rates are only going up, so I did it.

The other appliances came with the house, and the seller didnt say why the fridge was missing, and after the price I got, I didnt really care.

But moving broke me and I grabbed a deal of a used fridge off C.List. $85 and it was stainless steel? Hell yeah.

Never again.

I set up a house camera after moving in, because Im a woman living alone. The footage off of it comes free with the fridge purchase. Maybe youll get famous, or maybe Fridge Freddy will eat you. Who knows? Hope your okay with either option. Free ghost with fridge.

One big draw of this house other than the half acre of land was the already installed doggy door leading into a privacy fenced back yard. Id suggest easy yard access if you take my fridge.

I showed the pup how to work the doggy door once and he spent the next three hours bounding in and out. Fridge Freddy must have been listening too, because he got the hang of it rather quickly.

Three days later I came home from work and the dog had peed in the hallway. It took a leash and going out the front door to get him to to leave the hallway at all. His hair stood up along his spine and his head hung low as we neared the living room. He hugged the wall and darted out of the house once I opened the door. Across the space, the kitchen seemed ominous.

After the pup had done his business and was tucked safely under my bed, I investigated the doggy door.

It wasnt stuck or broken and I saw no indication the pup had gotten caught in it, which would have been a legitimate explanation for his fear, as one time a baby gate had fallen on him as hed tried to get past it and for the rest of his days he was terrified of those gates.

The only thing out of whack was the black mud along the tiles and on the porch. I assumed doggo had dragged the mess in with him, but the sludge ended very close to the door and no paw prints led away into the house.

Great, I thought, the home inspector missed something. But dragging the ladder out and investigating the doorway and vents near it turned up nothing. Even crawling into the attic and onto the roof gave me no answers or leaks. Wherever the mess came from, it was outside.

I cleaned the sludge up and had to throw out the towels I used due to horrible stains. Not that I mind stained towels as scrap rags, but the black mud looked uncomfortably like faces howling.

Upon that realization, I cleared the house with sage and incense and double checked the Nest cam. Again, nothing.

A week went by of me having to leash walk the dog out the front door (defeating the purpose of buying a house with a backyard) before I got angry. The sludge turned up three more times and I had to buy more towels.  The dog curled up in the hallway as I cooked dinner each night and whined every time I touched the fridge. Finally, Id had enough.

Retraining the pup was tough. It took boiled chicken bits and bacon fat to get him comfy with being near the kitchen. I even moved his food to the kitchen, but hed rush to take huge mouthfuls of kibble and carry it to the hallway, where hed drop it and then eat it slowly. I got tired of the mess and moved his food back to the living room.

I kept an eye on the Nest cam but the camera blinked anytime the sludge appeared and  I started to think I had an extreme haunting on my house. I was right.

Oh, hey, by the way, Id just bought groceries before I stopped using the fridge so you get all that food when you pick up it up. I mean, technically, the fridge still works, theres just a sludge making monster trapped in it, so I cant really say its fully operational, ya know?

Fridge Freddy seemed to sense when I realized his presence was a haunt. Long hours on the camera were blacked out, and when the camera did work, Freddy would pick the best times to pop his howling stretched face into view suddenly, guaranteeing I jumped, screeched, and threw my phone in terror. (The Nest app works great, though. You can check in anytime.)

Freddy was a fright, His face was paper white with a grey tint and his mouth and eyes were black holes. I spent a long time getting scared by it, so I have his features memorized. If your ghostly presence requires a nose, Freddys not for you.

After he started haunting the camera, the instances of sludge increased, but I never saw where Freddy came from nor where he went in the house.

He oozed back in, spreading his mess around, and then hed jump to the camera frame, face stretched in a scream. I was kinda glad the camera muted sound.

Banishing didnt work. Freddy didnt answer to the priest, pastor, minister, or rabbi I brought in. He ignored both the High Priestess and the twelve sisters she had help her.

But he also didnt leave the kitchen unless it was through the doggy door. At my wits end and out of towels, I sprayed the door down with a mix of Windex and holy water. It worked, sort of.

Freddy woke me up that night screeching by the side of my bed. The dog and I slept in the bathtub after that, holy water spray bottle held close, and the door locked.

Freddy stopped screeching and trying to get into the bathroom somewhere around four AM. From the sludge under my bedroom window, and down the hallway, I could guess where he went. I briefly considered burning the house down, but then I just got mad.

You come into my home?!

After the bathroom incident, my dog refused to leave my side when I was home. As I cooked dinner, two days later (after cleaning up the largest sludge mess yet) the pup stood between the fridge and me. Leaning against my leg with his great bulk, he sniffed the air and then without real reason started licking the stainless steel of the fridge.

I ignored it at first, but five minutes later, he was still trying to eat the fridge. It took chasing him from the kitchen and blocking entry with the aforementioned baby gate to keep him out.

Anytime in the next few days that he managed to sneak into the kitchen, he was back to the fridge, lapping away. I started to wonder.

This whole haunting had taken over my life. I mean other than the mess, the fright night, and the camera blocking, Freddy wasnt really a problem, until my groceries began to vanish. That was like Fridge Freddy declaring war. The holy water Windex kept him out, and it also proved able to keep him in.

I douse the appliance daily now. It rocks constantly, Freddy bouncing around the shelves inside. The tie-downs keep the fridge shut tight and the holy water keeps him from seeping out the seems. I can only imagine the mess hes left inside. Maybe you wont want those groceries after all. Hes probably ate them all anyway.

So...you have the story: Haunted Fridge for Sale! Kinda nonworking, good for parts. [Ghost included for free.](http://facebook.com/subject3600writing) </TEXT>

<TITLE> My Mother was Mischievous </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [My mother was mischievous](https://www.reddit.com/user/subject3600/submitted) and the oldest of four. In a different time, her mother, Mary, thought nothing of leaving the eldest, at five years old, home alone to babysit the others.

Kids are perceptible to many things. When my maternal great-grandmother passed away, the kids quickly spotted her trailing along behind her husband. I doubt anyone believed my mother and her siblings, but it didnt change the fact that Granny haunted her husband until he too passed. At the funeral, the two dead lovebirds strolled hand-in-hand from the cemetery, winging their way in the great hereafter. 

The gift of seeing the Other passes easily down the line and comes at me from both sides of the family. It is a sense Ive spent many hours meditating on to make stronger.

My mother needed no such practice. At a young age, she could see much and it was while babysitting both siblings and cousins that her sixth sense proved life saving.

...

Why was Susie so annoying? All day shed been prodding and aggravating the other kids, and itd taken all of my mothers patience not to rear back and smack Susie. Now the girl was baiting one of the toddlers, dangling a pacifier just out of reach and making the kid squall.

Fed up, my mother slapped the binky from from Susies hand.

Ow! Youre mean! Susie cried out, before fleeing into the kitchen. My mother followed.

Why cant you just behave? my mother asked.

Im behaving just fine! Youre the bad one, Susie taunted back. She reached out and knocked a glass from the counter.

In front of my mother, time slowed as the cup shattered on the floor.

Thats it! my mother yelled, as she jerked open a kitchen drawer and took out the large butcher knife. If you dont stop, Ill make you!

Susie stuck out her tongue and darted down the basement steps. In the other room, all the babies began to bawl. It only took a second for my mother to decide to follow Susie.

The basement was dark, only a little sun making its way through the tiny high up windows. Susie was crouched behind the single pillar, doing a poor job of hiding. My mother came toward her with the knife raised. She wouldnt hurt Susie, just scare her into minding.

High above Susie, my mom chopped at the wooden support, burying and blunting the butcher knife. Susie shrieked and darted up as my mom pulled the blade back and scraped Susies hand in the recoil. Three drops of blood fell crimson on the dark floor. My mother dropped the knife. 

From the shadows, black smoke billowed up from the concrete. It took the form of my grandmother Mary dressed in funeral clothes, and loomed over the naughty children.

My mother and Susie shrieked, knowing they were in trouble, caught literally red-handed in Susies case. She darted up the stairs and my mother followed, knife forgotten. The shape did not give chase.

As they rushed from the kitchen, the front door opened and my grandmother Mary came in with groceries. Im not sure what she made of the girls claims, but the knife made its way into the tallest cabinet, safely out of reach of any five year old babysitter, and Susie received a bandage for her cut. If I had to guess, the whippings were swift, and the story of the basement ghost ignored.

But maybe thats only because Mary had long forgotten her own ability to see. [Have you?](https://www.facebook.com/subject3600writing) </TEXT>

<TITLE> My grandmother tells stories </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [My Grandmother Tells Stories.](https://m.reddit.com/u/subject3600/activity?sort=hot activity=submitted)

My grandmother was a witch, of that I am certain. But I am much less sure of what happened to me in my seventh year. My grandmother tells stories, and my memory is gilded with time. What follows is the most true telling of the time I visited the Other, the In-Between.

I remember her washing dishes in the kitchen sink, suds and hot water everywhere. The sun was bright through the kitchen window, illuminating the lines on her face.

She looked at me as I dried plates. Joy-lee, she said in that frustrating way the paternal side of my family pronounces my first and middle names. (I divested of it quickly in fourth grade after my parents divorced. Joie, Id say. Just Joey.)

Joy-lee, she said, snapping me back to the past. Im gon show you what it is to work your own kinda magic.

Her husband was out in the field. The kitchen was safe for now.

I attended church with them every Sunday, and coming out of the chapel, she had seen me stumble. But I didnt fall. Instead, I floated momentarily off balance, before righting myself and replanting my feet firmly on the sidewalk. To her, it looked as if someone invisible had caught me mid-tumble. I had the magic of the family and it was time to learn how to wield it. No one else noticed, least of all her husband.

Untrained magic leads to disaster, and theres always something out there hungry for a power source. Especially for my family.

As she showed me how to charm the water to get the dishes extra clean, or how to heat the air around me to show my temper, or the simple shield we use to keep out intrusive thoughts, she also told me of the familys own Witch Eater.

One of my great-to-power-of-umph-grandmothers cursed a man, ages ago, so the story went. Maybe he deserved it, maybe he didnt. Trapped in the form of a shadowy dog-like beast, he couldnt tell us his side of the story. What he could do was consume souls and magic power to remain alive. And he had a hankerin for the women of my family. As long as we lived, so would he.

And I had to protect myself from him.

My grandmother, the one standing next to me in the kitchen, lost her dog to him years ago, and it may have been the only reason she lived through the encounter.

I keep a German Shepherd around now. It seems memory is strong in the WitchEater, because he doesnt bother me when my dog is near. Its also not a constant haunting, but the shadow is there most days, at the corner of my vision. A shaggy black dog beast, ready to feed.

It disappeared for a month once, and only returned after I got word that my cousin Samantha died in a house fire. All that was left of her and anything else had been ash, which, conveniently, is what you turn into when your magic is sucked dry.

After I mastered my shield, my grandmother seemed more comfortable with me running around alone with my magic.

Stay away from strange things, was the warning she gave me, anytime I wanted to dart off into the cornfield, or run around the catfish pond.

Im sure at no less than twenty different occasions she forbade me from petting stray dogs. But a child doesnt listen all the time, and to be honest, PUPPY! is still the first thought in my head at the sight of a dog.

Let me get to the meat of this story.

I was fishing alone on the bank of the pond, safely in sight of the kitchen window, when the grass rustled behind me. I had been teasing catfish onto my line with little shimmers under the water, and had a small bushel of fish already.

I didnt think much of whatever was behind me, since birds and squirrels and rabbits were a thing here in the country. But when its shadow fell across me, darkening the water and bringing with it a chill, I quickly turned.

The ferocious beast stood as tall as a man, its giant muzzle housing long fangs. More wolf than dog, and more monster than wolf, I blinked for a moment, before saying, Puppy! It seemed a little taken back by my response.

Across the pond, my grandmother was shouting. Time slowed down as I stood to greet the dog. He pressed forward and together we fell from the bank.

The pond shouldve been warm, it being mid-July and near 95 in Alabama. But as the frigid water engulfed me, I knew something was wrong.

On the bank all my grandmother found was a pile of ash.

Under the water, the pond was alive. I floated just above the sandy bottom. Sunlight dappled the ground, the water distorting it. I could breathe or maybe I didnt need to. There was no pressing weight on my chest.

Near me, the great shaggy dog sat, waiting patiently. I was in his grip now, and he had all the time in the world. My feet touched down on the grit and I made my way towards him.

From a long way off, I heard my grandmother cursing. When I got back, my hide was in for a tanning. If I got back

Where are we? I tried to ask, but only a large bubble left my mouth and floated slowly up.

The dog huffed and a bubble formed before his snout, before seeking its freedom far above.

As young as I was, I still knew enough about where I probably happened to be. the inbetween is just that, a place between life and the after. If thats where Id fallen, I wasnt dead yet. But the way you come in isnt the way you leave. As the dog turned and walked away from me, I followed.

Under the water, the land sloped down and grew darker. We werent alone. Many spirits trailed alongside us, in varying stages of decay. Souls dont rot as a body does, but those trapped in purgatory will fall to pieces if they never seek their next adventure. Faces leered at me, eyes too bright, mouths a gaping hole. Like hooks with bait and fish, I gleamed like bait to these poor things. The dog growled and most moved on. I had been claimed, and would be no ones ride back to the Living Realm.

The dog started walking and I followed. The land sloped into darker depths, and still we walked. Lost souls kept their distance, but they were following us. They couldnt help themselves.

The scenery grew more horrid, terrifyingly so. Large shapes swam along just out of focus, and always there was the grin of the dead, waiting on my guardian to leave me, before they pounced.

We came finally to two pedestals, with giant gemstones on top of both. One held an amethyst, cracked through with gold, and the other an onyx, silky black and perfect.

The dog spoke then, low and gravelly. Choose, lucky number thirteen. Choose power or choose to stay here. Either way, I feed.

What do you mean? I asked the puppy.

You are the strongest witch I will have ever devoured, the thirteenth witch of your line. Choose a stone, and accept your fate.

I want to go home.

Then choose power, and receive borrowed time. It all ends the same way, but mayhap youll do some good in your life first, with the gifted strength.

No! I want to go home! I yelled at the beast, and waves crashed with my voice. We were engulfed in water, and as he spoke again, a bubble formed from his muzzle. I threw myself into the words, and floated away from the pond floor.

My grandmother was waiting on the bank, too wise to think me really gone. She lifted me from the water and in one motion spanked my bottom and drew my soaking self in for a hug.

We didnt talk much of what happened. That was not her way. Instead, I strengthened my shield, and learned from her all I could, until I surpassed her in ability. We kept the thirteenth a secret. No one in the family needed a new reason to bother us for help.

But the abilities I carry are nothing to what waits upon my death.

<TEXT> God, I hate [resolutioners.](https://www.reddit.com/user/subject3600/submitted)

You know the type. (You may even be one of them.) They flock to bars on New Years Eve, shove down tons of drinks and potato skins by the pound, and then the next day, theyre a gym rat with kale smoothies. Inevitably, two weeks later, theyre back at the bar, resolutions forgotten.

And thats how the shadows feed. You cant see them, but youre the host anyway.

I was a resolutioner two years ago. I joined friends at a dive bar and we toasted our goals. I resolved to be nicer, my friends to join a gym. But when we clinked the glasses together, the shadows appeared.

I thought at first that a stray cat had slipped in. The creeping thing was the right size. But when the shadows came skittering through closed windows and from under the tables en masse, I knew they werent strays. They had too many legs.

My beer sloshed out as I jumped back, barely keeping a grip on the mug, but no one else reacted to the invasion.

An inky black form eyed me from the puddle of my drink. It was like a spider, sort of, with fangs bared, and ghostly blue pupils in each of the many eyes. It didnt hold its shape well. The legs kept blinking in and out of existence.

I wondered if my beer was spiked. How drunk was I? The other women around me werent reacting to the shadow tarantulas on and around our table.

My friends didnt notice when the creatures crept up and settled along the womens backs and between their shoulder blades, like evil arachnid scarves or backpacks.

The one in front of me hissed and when I slammed my beer mug down on it, the conversation around the table ceased.

What the hell? Mandy asked at my freak out. I mean, party foul at the spill, but whatd the table ever do to you?

The rest of the gals laughed. Under my mug, the spider dissipated.

From each of my friends backs, many eyes watched me.

So, workout buddies? Jess said to Mandy, returning to their previous conversation. Mandy turned back, one final look at me clearly showing she thought me too drunk to function.

As they planned out their new year, each of the spiders slowly sunk their fangs into the necks they hung around. The many legs tightened around their mounts. I felt panic rise.

Did my friends not feel the weight or the bite? Maybe I was drunk. I excused myself to the bathroom and called a cab. I missed the countdown and fell asleep that night with a can of Raid next to me.

Over the next few weeks, I saw more and more of thethings. And they were growing, getting bigger and more noticeable. Some dwarfed the human they rode on.  But then slowly, they began to vanish. People I saw regularly whod sported the spider riders no longer had their parasite. In mid-March, there was nearly no trace of the creatures any longer. Their disappearance gave me little peace. The beady eyes and long legs haunted my dreams. I developed arachnophobia with a fierceness.

Only Mandy and Jesss spiders didnt grow. Instead they shrank, limbs and bodies diminishing. In April they invited me to join them for an open gym day (a half-hearted effort to re-recruit drop off resolutioners and their friends.)

On the treadmill, as I lagged behind Jesss seven minute mile, the two women gushed about their new gym rat lifestyle and howd theyd definitely be sticking to it. At that moment, with their determination, the New Years spiders loosened their fangs and fell away, dispersing as they hit the ground.

And thats when I knew.

Not many people have seen my messages, posts, or speculations. No one else has seen the spiders, that Ive found.

It took two years to be sure, absolutely sure. Two years watching people make and break promises, and being a host to the parasites. Do you feel heavier after making a New Years resolution? Its because theres a literal weight on your back, your very own resolution parasite. The spider seems to feed on your hopes, fangs deep in the base of your neck. If you looked over your shoulder--really looked--youd see the eyes, the fangs, the furry body.

Did you make a resolution this year? Keep it. Hang onto that dedication, and eventually the spider will starve and fall away. Break your resolution, and feed that parasite. It will suck you dry of hope and faith. And next year, make no resolutions. I can still the scars of the fangs of previous years. They dont heal.

<TEXT> Its Christmas Eve and Im hiding under the stairs in my own home because my idiot uncle invoked the spirit of Krampus.

Oh god, another Krampus story. Yeah, yeah, I know.

But theres something stomping around the house, and Im stuck in a cabinet like Harry Potter, writing this on my phone with the brightness setting all the way down.

I dont even really know how he managed it. I mean one second it was racist politics, the next, demon-beast-goat-monster breaking down the door and everyone screaming. And I think there were some little minion kids, too, but with the way the gravy and duck were flying through the air and all broken door bits, one cant really be sure. The maniacal cackling makes me think I definitely saw evil helpers, though.

Aunt Brenda made it to the bathroom, and she was screeching about 911, cell phone in her grip, so maybe help is coming. Maybe she managed it.

Shit...Im not breathing, something is just outside the door.

In case I dont make it, learn from our mistake. Whatever you do, dont talk politics at the Christmas table this year.

<TITLE> Up Candy Hill </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-08 07:49:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Candy Hill](https://www.reddit.com/user/subject3600)

Have you ever heard of Candy Hill? Its a local legend around my part of Alabama. Not many want to talk about it, nor what happened up there that makes people hush when you mention it. Some tourists come through, stopping to see the Ave Maria Grotto, and there on the map, physical or digital, itll say Candy Hill at the top of Cobbler Lane. Sounds like a joke, but its not, I promise. The horror up on that hill...well, maybe Ill do it justice. Maybe shell let me tell you. Maybe she wont.


I was young, but old enough to know better, and still dumb enough to do it anyway.


Wed bike around the neighborhood. No cell phones, no parents, just two tires and the road under us, a gaggle of goofy kids, who didnt know better than to climb storm drains, and locked gates.


Candy Hill had such a gate at the bottom of it, and a long fence, extending out from the road that led up to it. The fence conceivably encircled the area, going all the around the mountain. Google Maps shows me now that this isnt so. The gate had about 100 yards of fence stretching out on either side of it, but stopped once the ground got too rocky to continue. I guess they figured if a car couldnt get across, there was no need for more fence.


But to be fair, the fence never wouldve kept us out anyway. It only encouraged my little neighborhood gang even more.


The story goes that Sally Jacobs climbed that hill with her boyfriend one night. He drove his old Chevy truck straight up Candy Hill and parked in the little lot at the top. You can see some of the city from there, the little lights and a few billboards shining in the dark. It was a good parking spot in the 90s. Until Sally


Well, Sally died up there. Her boyfriend cut her into pieces, piercing so hard into her stomach, he sliced the upholstery of his truck seat, too. The blood got everywhere, coating the inside of his windshield, his dash, and even his face and clothes. It ran in rivers over the bench seat, and out the doors on both sides. Sallys blood stained the blacktop.


He left her up there when he was done, a destroyed body slashed to pieces and tossed into the bushes only fifteen feet into the woods that surround that blacktop.


People dont go to Candy Hill anymore. The fence is there for a reason.


But no one wants to tell kids what a vicious and unhinged teenager did to his girlfriend, so we were given the PG version: Construction, danger, lots of glass and rock.


Of course word gets around. We all knew why we werent allowed up there. Sally Jacobs trusted the wrong boy.


One cold November day, I joined my ragtag bunch of kids to stare through the gate that lead to Candy Hill. It wasnt a tall gate. Nothing we couldnt scale easy.


John had dared David that he wouldnt climb the fence, and David dared John that he wouldnt either. They were bickering over it. Who was more scared of dead Sally and Candy Hill.


There were only two girls in the group, myself and Jesse. We were always out to prove something, that we were stronger, faster, and braver than the boys, because we were, but hell if the boys believed it. Jesse and I had to prove it more often than not.


Ill do it! I volunteered, when John and Davids argument had stretched into long annoying moments of inaction.


Pfft, yeah right, John taunted me. John was a dick.

Prove it, David dared.


I swallowed, regretting my bravado. Fine, I will, but you gotta do my math homework for a week.


David laughed, Sure, but you aint gonna do it.


Id take that bet. I jumped the fence, the chainlink bouncing against the poles with that metal jangling sound that fences give when protesting the weight of a small child. Lodging the toes of my sneakers into the small diamond openings, I began hauling my minor body weight up the gate.


Jo! I wasnt serious. Maybe you shouldnt! David looked at Jesse, Tell her she shouldnt.


I aint telling her nothing. You started this, shes gonna finish it.


I reached the top, and swung a leg over.


You proved your point, stupid. Now come back. David was scared Id get him in trouble for this dare, like the time he told me I couldnt make a six foot jump from the roof of his moms truck to the roof of his house. I didnt make it. His mom was pissed.


Two weeks of math homework, and Ill come back, I told him. He considered before nodding.


Fine, I acquiesced and went to swing my leg back over again. Something was snagged on the metal fence. I turned to look and found myself staring straight into the milky white eyes of a rotting face.


She had grabbed my jeans, latching fleshless fingers into my belt loop. I screamed bloody murder and tried to struggle free. All I managed to do was fall six feet straight on top of the zombie.


We landed hard, and her rib cage gave a bit as I sunk into her decaying corpse. I pulled away, the stench eating up into my nose, and my arms came back coated in slime and gore. I screamed again.


What I could only assume was Sally sat up and grinned at me, eyes still milky, but now hanging out of her sockets. Her hair had pulled away from her head in a sheet and was barely hanging on, her skull a perfect white under the slipping flesh.


Wheres Kyle? Sallys mouth couldnt really speak the words. Her tongue had shriveled, and was barely there. Her mouth flapped a bit, and in the rough whispering, I could barely understand her meaning. Where did Kyle go?


Kyle Peters, her boyfriend. The one who cut her up and let her bleed out in his truck. He spent a few years in a mental ward before being released to guardians whod promised to keep him in line. Insanity saved that seventeen year old. He lived cozy with his parents, with a Playstation, a new Chevy truck, and enough medication to keep him floating calm in Candy Land.


But did Sally need to know that?


Where. Is. Kyle? she rasped out.


Uh...uh...w-w-with his parents over on Orchid I told her.


Pay she shook me, her bony fingers squeezing me tight. He...pay Her jaw fell off then, bouncing down into the gore of her stomach. I winced and tried to back up, but she held on with one hand, and reached into her torso with the other. After digging around in the muck, which the sight of made me nearly puke, she pressed a grime coated pocket knife into my hand. Pay
 she wheezed, more of a breath than an actual word.


She wanted Kyle to pay.


I came to on the far side of the fence, clutching a red handled pocket knife Id not had when Id climbed the fence. Jesse had jumped the chain link to wake me up, when the others had raced off. I wasnt hurt, just a bit winded, and very confused.


Sally? I asked.


Jeez, did you hit your head. Maybe we should go to the ER. Im Jesse. She pointed at herself. Jesse.


I waved my friend off and stood, dizzy. Long minutes passed, before we climbed the fence and biked home slowly, the heavy knife in my pocket.


No one else had seen anything, no ghouls, zombies, or ghosts. I was alone in my delusion.


And it stayed that way in the weeks after when Sally insisted on waking me up every night to wheeze the word PAY into my ear. Her milky white eyes hanging on her cheeks were ingrained into all my nightmares, and even some waking hours.


After a month, I couldnt take it anymore.


I guess thats why I went to Orchid in the middle of the night, and left my bike in the gutter, as I made him pay in the dark of his parents house.


Just like Sally wanted.


Five years in a mental institution for disturbed youth, and an affidavit that my parents will keep me stable afterwards seem like sweet justice for Sally.

<TEXT> [Read the others first.](https://www.reddit.com/user/subject3600/submitted)

My grandmother died when I was twenty five, almost exactly a year ago. She spent a few weeks in a hospice, before drifting off into a coma, and then passing quietly when her heart failed.


It doesnt matter how magical we are, Death will come for us all. My grandmother waved as she left with the winged creature, fading out in the hallway as she passed me. Death smirked, knowing one day shed be back for me as well.


The house where wed spent so many years was deeded to the all of the children, and majority winning, it would be put up for auction after we cleaned it out.


I volunteered for the cleaning crew, and had plenty of help the first two days. On the third day, everyone else refused to show up, after Cal, the haint in the fireplace, wrecked the dining room with soot and ash from a blowback draft down the chimney. After that, the family wanted to hire professionals to clean the place out, or just set it ablaze and be done with it.


It honestly wasnt Cals fault he was pissed that a new family would be residing with him soon. All the others in the house were angry as well, but most took my offer to set them free, instead of waiting to see if the next owners would be as cool as my grandmother.


Cals temper tantrum took an extra week to clean the place out. It was a sad thing, throwing out items that at one time my grandmother had held, but memories are stronger than things, and truth be told, the couch, hand towels, and kitchen knives were all a little ragged from forty plus years of use. The only thing I fought to keep was the family bible. While not my religion, the extra large tome had sat by the front door for several decades and seen more than anything else in the house. It was special.


I kept my grandmothers cane as well, something shed whittled a few years prior after age had set in, and she couldnt move around the farm so well. It was dressed in runes and sigils, stories and psalms, and held some power for repelling both negative thoughts and naughty grandchildren.


Halloween came, the last day before the hired cleaners were due in. I finished up in the house the best I could alone, doubled checked that both Fireplace Cal and Jameson (from the basement) were staying after making them promise not to wreak too much havoc on the next family, and hid the key under the back door mat. I wouldnt need it again.


My grandmother waited by the driveway, looking out over the cornfield. It didnt surprise me.


I stowed the few things I was keeping in my car, but kept the carved cane in my hand, before walking over to her. She smiled, and nodded towards the field.


It was fallow currently, only a few stalks left to compost. We wouldnt have a harvest this year. The scarecrows stood tall among the otherwise empty field.


Whatcha want? I asked her. She stepped out into the dirt, and drifted away. Confused, I moved forward. As I crossed from grass to tilled soil, my surroundings changed. I cursed myself for forgetting the date. The veil was thin today. Halloween was a good time to reach across, and a great time to get stuck on the other side.


The farm on this side was darker, reality just a bit more wavy, and less sure. Before me the corn stood tall and thick, but a closer look at the ear revealed smut, a corn fungus. Confused, I stepped farther into the field, looking over the crop. Why was the field sick here, when there was no corn planted on the real side?


My grandmother appeared beside me, and took my arm. We walked quietly through the stalks, her leading me gently along.


The farther we traveled, the sicker the corn got, the stalks browning, the ears drooping, the soil turning grey under my feet.


I started to understand. We reached the sixth scarecrow. The festering rot spread out from his base, eating into the entire field.


In my cleaning, I had not offered to set the scarecrows free. Honestly, Id been too worried about what might escape if I did.


My grandmother pointed at the sickly ground around the sixth scarecrows pole. I looked at my dead grandmother. She smiled, tapped the cane tucked under my arm, and stepped back. She meant for me to deal with this alone.


I considered telling her no dice. This did not seem like my idea of a good time. But before the house left the family, something would have to be done about the disease spreading over the field, and other than Anna, I was the only capable one.


Youre gonna owe me, I told my grandmother, before I stepped up to the scarecrow. His appearance hadnt changed much on this side, if my memory served. Bloated face, perfect embroidered features, and a terrifying grin looked down at me. I shuddered and drew the circle wide, digging the canes rubber stopper deep into the dirt.


Focusing on the carvings my grandmother had made in the wood, I summoned up the energy needed to bring the scarecrow to life.


He screamed.


Seething from the top of his pole, his gaze seared me. He continued to scream. It was probably agony. A pole up your backside as support is hardly comfortable.

He slithered from his height then, dropping into the sickly dirt and coming for me. He walked as all scary things do, with a twitch and a flash.

I guess I needed to cleanse and release him. If I didnt, hed likely continuing poisoning the ground, and the next person to own the farm probably didnt deserve it. I wondered if his poison had hurt any of us.

His face loomed near mine as I focused on his souls tether to the scarecrow body and found the thin thread that stitched him down. I was about to cut it, when a hand touched my shoulder and I jumped. Behind me, the other five scarecrows moved in, detached from their poles now. The leader, the one I found solace at the base of so many years ago, tapped my arm gently, before he and the rest surrounded the sixth.


The man I refused to call my grandfather would have an escort to the afterlife. May he burn.


I severed the tie, and all six scarecrows fell to the ground lifeless. My grandmother smiled and faded away.


The other side let me return to the mortal plane with only a pop and no real struggle. On this side, the scarecrows stood upon their poles in a circle around the sixth. I thanked them silently, before gassing them down with old kerosene, and lighting up the field. I would leave no ties for any wicked souls to return.


It felt like a real goodbye when I left this time, the farmhouse in my rearview mirror for too long before I turned off the country road and headed back to town.


Its been a year. The farm sold, and I think the new farmer managed a healthy crop, according to my uncle, who still talks to the guy.


But the astral is calling again, some new problem, and my grandmother stands by my bed. I dont think itll be so easy to get back out again, but I know Ill try anyway. I cant deny her. If you don't hear from me, I may still be on the other side fighting. Something must really be wrong. [Why else would she be back?](http://facebook.com/subject3600writing) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Cousin Anna and the Ouija Board </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Previous Stories](https://m.reddit.com/u/subject3600/activity?sort=hot activity=submitted)

**Cousin Anna and the Ouija Board**

The phone call was hurried; a rushed explanation, an address and a plea. Theyd messed with something they shouldnt have even known about.

And of course I was expected to fix it.

Most of my cousins knew better than to break out the Ouija board at a house party, but itd been too late by the time Anna caught them, hands on the planchette, as the lights in the room flickered and something answered their call. She locked herself in the bathroom and called me from a circle of bath salt on the tile floor. The girl wasnt dumb, but she was trapped.

Spirit boards were used as early as the Song Dynasty, but the Ouija Board is a Hasbro-owned term coined in 1901, by a man named Fuld, who thought he could speak Egyptian Arabic. (Later he admitted that Ouija comes from the French and German words for yes.) Yes-Yes Boards have been available in America since the 1890s, and playing with one was considered a parlor game for many years before mediums and spiritualists took the rite up a notch and claimed to speak to the dead. Since then, boards have been given a bad rep, and are known as a surefire way to get your shit possessed, according to some Pagans, Christians, and other people that dont know what theyre talking about.

Heres what a Ouija Board really is: cardboard and ink, with just a bit of plastic.

Can it get you in trouble? Sure, if you let it. But it requires some power to do so. Outside of Hollywood, a couple college kids screwing around with a planchette are completely safe, unless one of them has a buried ability in their blood to summon up something actually dangerous.

Apparently the houseparty had one such attendee, and the moment her fingers guided that plastic pointer across the cardboard and ink, something answered. Idiots. If you want to talk to ghosts, meditate with some incense, a white candle, and a specific dead person in mind. Dont just let anyone in. And keep your hands off spirit boards, unless youre an absolute muggle. This isnt a movie, and I cant save everyone.

I pulled up to the house on the outskirts of a ritzy neighborhood. The address Anna gave me belonged to a mailbox with *Rainiers* printed neatly on it. It sounded familiar, but I gave it no real thought.

In the neatly manicured yard, a few party goers huddled together, talking quickly. I asked if anyone had called the cops yet, and they shook their heads.

Whats going on? one of them asked, pushing the others aside to follow me towards the house. She stopped at the bottom of the porch, as I continued on, without answering.

Im by no means an expert in the paranormal. I dont even much like it. But Ive talked with the dead, seen some things that made me a believer, and as much as I hate it, Id been marked by Death early in my life. So people tended to trust me to save their ass in stupid situations. Wish I got paid for it.

Inside the house, most of the bulbs had blown, a good sign something was drifting around. I checked my neck for the little star charm hanging there, and patted it twice, taking solace in its presence. From my pocket, I pulled out my phone, and turned on both the flashlight and camera. Likely nothing would show on the recording screen, but it couldnt hurt.

I made my way through the foyer, and into a living room. The couch lay on its back, and ashes from the fireplace coated the entire room, as if a backdraft had torn through the chimney. Sooty handprints covered the walls and ceiling, with some of the fingers stretching down the sheetrock as if the person had been dragged along. I held my phone light high and surveyed the room. It was very dark outside of the beam. As I swept the phone around, checking the screen for any disturbance, something flashed by my shoulder. I froze, and in my peripheral saw a woman step up to my side. Refusing to look, I tried to make out her features in the dark room, the bright light of my recording screen ruining my night vision. She stood roughly five feet tall, just below my chin, with a tangled rats nest of black hair. Without warning, she screamed into my ear, her mouth stretching around the howl. I flinched and she vanished.

Great, she didnt like me. This would be fun.

I stepped past the destroyed couch, and into the kitchen. I couldnt tell what was a mess from the party and what was destroyed because of the supernatural haunting taking place in this suburban dream. I swept a spot on the counter clean with my arm, pushing red Solo cups and melted jello shots into the sink. The sticky countertop pissed me off, but I didnt take the time to scrub it down before setting my purple Jansport in the driest spot I could find. From it, I pulled a repurposed Windex bottle filled with holy water, my banishing powder, and a white sage leaf. It misted as I sprayed it over my head, and the smell of black pepper and cloves settled around my shoulders.

Time for business. I played back the recording so far, and other than a dirty house and some minor static when the spirit screamed at me, nothing weird showed up. I sighed, and continued recording anyway. Hopefully my battery wouldnt die before I got Anna out of the house.

Sliding the now sticky backpack onto my shoulders, I stepped out of the kitchen, spray bottle pointed forward, and swept my light around the hallway. On the ceiling, ashy handprints led to the stairs. As I looked up, something popped across the hall, from one room to another. 

Bottle aimed like a gun, I crept forward, and pushed the bathroom door open with my boot. The room seemed empty, the mirror throwing back my camera light. The shower curtain was pulled shut, and I knew better than to look behind it. Whatever was floating around didnt need to be given any chances to mess with me. I sprayed the room down with the banishing mix, and shut the door. Across the way was an office, also empty. Shelves lined the walls, and books littered the floor. It seemed like a standard pissed off ghost. The Ouija Board had likely pulled her memory across, confusing her, and making her angry. It didnt happen often, but it wasnt impossible.

Most hauntings are only energy, past lives echoing across time and colliding with us. Some spirits were cognizant enough to know what happened or where they were, some even came back with personality, but others were empty thoughts, and hard to get rid of. Id try asking politely, before pulling out the big guns.

I took one last look around the scattered office, before it clicked that these Rainiers were likely the same as the local law firm on ALL of the billboards in the South. Best to get things done and get out before Mrs. Lawyer returned and sued me for property damage. Out of the office window, I could see that the small group of college aged kids on the lawn had grown in number, and were studying the house. I was glad theyd escaped the terror. I flashed my light through the glass and they all flinched back, unable to see me behind the bright light. With a laugh, I misted the room down, before moving on.

Upstairs, things looked much the same: lights blown, belongings and furniture scattered, and handprints along the ceiling, which honestly could pass for a crazy house party, if thered been enough liquor.

Off the landing, a door was slamming into something repeatedly, the thump thump thump freaking me out more than anything so far. I made my way through the darkness, cell phone light sweeping back the shadows. 

I checked the screen again to see if anything was visible, and a face popped up, eyes wide and mouth open. Hands came around the phone screen to grab me, and I jumped back, cursing. Too late, I sprayed the air with the bottle, but she was already gone.

Poltergeists cause mischief and mayhem just because they can, but its usually focused on one person, or family. Ive seen them attach to a house over time, but rarely has a poltergeist ever formed so quickly after being summoned. Most things summoned take time to build energy or anger before acting out, even rudely awakened ghosts. The exception was demons. With them, all bets are off.

But I doubted this was a demon, just a fast reacting spirit. Maybe shed died badly and the memory fueled her anger. It didnt matter; she had to go.

I continued my investigation of the house, and came to a shut door. Knocking got me no answer, so I opened the door slowly, raising the light to see what lay beyond. It was another bathroom. On the tile floor sat a jug of spilled bath salts, the debris forming an interrupted circle. Anna had been here, had formed the safety circle, but the rose scented salt ring had been broken at some point. No ghost could get through a circle of power, so Anna wouldve chosen to scatter the salt line and venture out. That dumb girl. I noticed then that the mirror had cracked, a good trick to get humans to panic and flee. But Anna was smarter than that. Shed only leave the certain safety if she really needed to.

I misted my spray here too, effectively ridding the spirit of three rooms to hide in, before continuing on.

I reached the first bedroom where the door was thudding into a pair of human legs bent around the frame. Shit. I took a breath, praying it wasnt Anna, and shouldered the door open, stepping into the room beyond.

Somehow I hadnt noticed the smell, too preoccupied with Anna and the house, but every inch of this room was coated in blood and viscera. Bodies littered the floor here, all of them fallen back from the center of the room where a coffee table sat with a Ouija Board on top. The Hasbro box lay nearby, ripped up and coated in red. Anna hadnt said anyone was dead when she called, panicked. Where the hell was she?

Stepping carefully around the bodies, I looked for her in the group of dead kids. I reached the other side of the room without finding Anna, and peered out the window. The kids on the lawn looked up at me. The house was dark, so they shouldnt have been able to see me standing in the shadows. I studied their faces, trying to find my cousin, when I realized those below me were the same as the dead kids behind me. The room grew icy cold, and dreading what Id find, I turned slowly from the window to find the ghosts of the dead kids standing behind me.

Had no one escaped the party house?

In the hallway, Anna flew by the door without a word. I paused, eyeing the kids, but they only stared me down. Spray bottle and camera at the ready, I stepped back across the room and into the hallway. The spirits parted to let me through.

In the dark, Anna had vanished again, but Death appeared briefly, passing by me, her black eyes, inky tears, and red smile bright in the dark. She turned into the bedroom, and I called after her, Take the evil one with you too, while youre at it. She only laughed in response, and I shuddered. The sound was just as rough as I remembered it, sandpaper against silk, the last breath of a teenager and the setting of the sun. I let her go, unchallenged. May the kids in that room find peace.

There were two rooms left, both bedrooms if I had to guess. I entered the closest one, and immediately the bed sheets moved. I jerked my spray bottle up and shined the light forward. Shiny eyes reflected in the camera, and I breathed easier. On the bed, peeking out from the pillows, sat a little terrier. I stepped forward slowly, hand out and he sniffed my fingers before wagging his tail. Save the dog, rule number one in any paranormal event. I scooped the friendly beast into my backpack and zipped up the sides. He poked his head out, happy to tag along.

Alright, Fido, wheres Anna? I asked him, as I moved back to the hallway. 

The last room in the house was the masters bedroom, and I entered it cautiously. On the bed, Anna sat head in her hands.

Hey, I whispered, but she didnt look up. Hey! I said louder, and she jerked, dragging her head up. It lolled backwards, as if her neck didnt have the strength to support it, and then rolled along her shoulders until her eyes met mine. Her hands fell to the bed, and her jaw went slack. She gurgled at me, the same damn sound the Grudge girl made, and thats when I realized she was screwing with me.

You bitch, I cursed at her, and she laughed. Anna returned to normal and waved me over.

What happened here, other than the obvious? I asked.
Kids, Ouija Boards, possession, the yuge, she said, abbreviating *usual* and making my eye twitch.

And? I asked, wanting to know where the angry ghost had gone.

Oh! Shes in the bathroom, I trapped her. I wouldve just taken care of it, but my bug-out bag is in the car, and I figured youd hate to have wasted the gas and not be needed. Anna paused, and as if on cue, a weird groaning echoed behind the master baths door.

You trapped a ghost in a bathroom? I asked, incredulous. Its not impossible, but she had nothing but bath salt.

Yeah, but only because its actually inside Sarah right now. I locked that thing in her just a minute ago.

Wait, who?

Sarah Rainier, lives here, goes to school with me, hosted this party? Anna waved her hand around, the snarky tone of her voice only serving to piss me off.

The lawyers daughter summoned a ghost with a spirit board?

Yup. Must notve not known she could. Her moms pretty vanilla. Their family likely hasnt dabbled in the occult for generations.

I nodded. Right, well, Im sorry about all your friends in the other room.

Anna nodded, face softening. Gonna be hard explaining this to her parents, and the cops.

That was a problem for later.

I handed the backpack and camera to Anna, and she smiled at the dog. I pulled white candles from another of the pockets, and a lighter from my jeans. She aimed the flashlight at the bathroom, and noted the diminished battery life of my phone. I shrugged. We were almost done now.

Setting candles in front of the door, I lit them, and then made a half circle of salt around the threshold, so Sarah couldnt get by me. I stepped over the ring and imagined white energy surrounding me. Properly grounded, I opened the door, and stepped into the bathroom.

Sarah crouched in the tub, staring at me. I held the spray bottle out, but she didnt move. Locked in a body must have confused her even more. Sarah breathed heavily through her mouth, great gulping breaths like she didnt quite understand how to work her lungs.

I knelt by the bathtub, and took Sarahs wrist in my hand. There was a pen mark there, drawn by Anna. I licked my thumb and rubbed it off, but kept a firm grip on Sarah. She didnt resist, nor did the spirit in her try to flee with the rune broken.

Its time to go, I crooned softly. Will you please go? And not hurt anyone else. They didnt mean to pull you here.

Sarah stared at me, dazed. Her eyes were too wide, and her mouth drooped on one side. She tried to speak, but it was less than a gurgle.

I sighed, and spoke again. I need you to go. Dont make me bang a spoon on a pan, please. It looks ridiculous and hurts my ears. The stupid Tumblr advice actually does work in a pinch, but Anna would never let me live it down.

Sarah chose that moment to start choking, great shuddering coughs that wracked her entire body. Something was happening. Not taking a chance, I turned on the shower, and cold water cascaded over us. Running water solved Sarahs ghost problem.

The shaking grew worse, but the angry energy dissipated under the waterfall. She collapsed in the bottom of the tub, and I turned the faucet off, before returning to Anna.

Call the cops, and stop the camera, I said, and she did.

It was not a fun night that I spent talking to the cops. I couldnt tell them much, other than Anna called me from inside a locked bathroom when she heard screaming, and I came to help her immediately. We didnt show them my video, and Anna explained that she called me instead of 911 because shed panicked.

They took my info because Id wandered into the room of dead kids, but otherwise dismissed Anna and me, since we were both women and barely 250 pounds together.

Sarah rode to the hospital, still unconscious.

I still dont know what the official report says (and Im curious because they had to somehow explain the handprints on the ceiling,) but I can say Sarah is very lucky her mother is a lawyer.

In less than a year, the case was closed unsolved, the Rainiers had moved across the country, and Anna had a good reason to skip house parties.

As for me, well...Im still not getting paid to save dumbasses.

<TEXT> [The Tales of My Grandmother](https://m.reddit.com/u/subject3600/activity?sort=hot activity=submitted)



**My Grandmother and the Demon**

The women on my fathers side are anything but normal. We talk to spirits, dream the future, calm and raise storms, protect our own, and cook amazing food.

Pair those abilities with my mothers Boricua blood, and I never stood a chance. Shes only one generation away from still living in the Puerto Rico. I know firsthand what old magic is.

My matrilineality is why I live and breathe magic.

And its why my maternal grandmother fled Puerto Rico. Its why Ill never step foot there. My life depends on it.

I know little of Marias life once she arrived stateside, but everything before the one-engine plane dropped her here is a cautionary tale for her descendants.

At sixteen, Maria was a pretty girl living in small town between the base of Cerro de Punta and the Rio Zamas. She worked under her mother, the towns medicine woman, and midwife. Some still celebrated the old Tano cems (gods, spirits, and ancestors), but many had converted to Catholicism, and the small town even built a church to the saints.

It wasnt illegal to worship the old ones, but it was spurned in society, so Marias mother kept her faith in secret, merging old magics with new beliefs in front of her patients and customers.

Maria was raised in two faiths, blending them together to create magic in 
Catholicism, pleading the angels to carry her wishes to Gods ear, and working cures and relief from local plant life and prayer. As long as the townspeople were happy, and healthy, Maria and her mother were not questioned about their workings, or their ties to the old gods.

Everyone has heard of La Llorona, the Weeping Woman, who has ties in every Latinx and Hispanic culture across the Americas and Carribean, but the true story is a folk tale of the Boricua people and a leash for their unruly children. What most have never heard is what the woman did before she killed her children and wandered off into eternity.

Born Ivelisse Madera, La Llorona married rich and lived poorly. As her husband began to lose interest in her and their children, Ivelisse pleaded with Maria and her mother to turn his eye back to her.

There is not enough magic in the world to cement a straying spouses loyalty, sadly. Maria and her mother tried their best, painting Ivelisses body in the colors of the stars and sitting her in a circle beneath the night sky, beseeching gods and saints alike to make her husband faithful. But no good magic can make a lover love again without their consent.

When the all the spells they knew fizzled out, Ivelisse took matters into her own hands and turned her back on the holy. Under the same night sky, Ivelisse killed Marias mother, and with the blood asked anyone who listened to bring her husband back. A demon answered, made of black smoke and red flesh. Maria fled, weeping and terrified, as the beast rose from the river that flowed out of her mothers slit throat.

An agreement was made, but Ivelisse in her desperation did not specify the length of time her husbands affection should return. He looked upon her fondly for a few years, before he drifted away again. Desperate, Ivelisse called upon her contract, and the demon requested new blood of the same line.

But Maria had ran much farther than Puerto Rico.

Unable to save her mother, and with no court system that would dare side against the rich Maderas, Maria took all of her mothers money, and immigrated to the U.S., where she was safely out of reach of demons summoned by scorned women.

Ivelisse knew shed lost her husband, and she needed someone to blame. What was one more deal with an evil being?

She drowned her children, giving over their souls to ensure her eternity. Now, she searches, not for the children, but for Maria, wandering the banks of the Rio Zamas, looking for the bloodline that will return her lover to her arms.

Does the taste of Marias blood live in my veins? I know a demon that could answer that question.

But Ill never give him the chance. [Too many other beings have a hold on my soul already.](http://facebook.com/subject3600writing) </TEXT>

<TEXT> It requires quiet and concentration, plus a strong belief that it will work.

You'll need any pretty little satchet or bag, finely woven to keep from shedding the ingredients, daffodil stems or petals, lavender, star anise, and sage, plus black salt. If you can't acquire any of these items, you can substitute them for an herb you like more. It's always been more about willpower than ingredients, anyway. (My favorite way to make black salt is with finely ground sea salt and incense ash. It will be more brown/gray in color, but it smells wonderful, and is the same.)

With the items before you, imagine yourself inside a large white circle, with all evil things and bad thoughts burning away. Place your gatherings in your satchet and pray or ask for safety and protection. When done, close the bag, and imagine your white circle dissipating into your protection satchet. It will glow in your mind.

Carry the bundle with you to repel negative energy. Squeeze for an extra boost of power.

*I hate that I have to say this, but this little bundle is for energy and bad spirits, not bullets, knives, or bad decisions.* </TEXT>

<TITLE> My Grandmother and Dead Cousin Dave </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-07 21:11:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The day Sallys husband came home, we were comforting her over having lost him to a work accident.

Itd been a long day. Wake, funeral, catering for the family gathering after we laid Dave to rest, meal prepping for Sal so she could sleep, eat, and mourn as was proper, and then cleaning up. We were on the last step when there came a knock at the door.

Id learned my lesson some years before, so I let someone else answer it, and continued drying the dishes my mom handed me. It was mindless work, and it helped lessen the sad thought of losing Dave, the first of Sallys husbands Id actually liked.

Aunt Brenda patted Sals arm, and went to the door. Brenda screamed when she saw whod knocked. I nearly dropped the plate I held, when I turned to look.

Dave stood on the doormat, smiling. Seem to have lost my keys. He glanced around Brenda and saw me at the sink. Hey Jo! The whole family here? Whats the occasion? As he turned his gaze to me, the right side of his head came into view, or rather what was left of it. The skull, right above the temple, had caved in, a rather nasty result of letting an I-beam fall onto it.

Brenda fainted, and my grandmother stepped right over her and out of the house, pulling Dave with her and shutting the door.

I dried my hands on my apron, double checking the pockets for the little herb packet wed made last week of daffodils stems, clover leaves, black salt, and sage, a handy aid against possession, and bad thoughts. Before stepping outside, I grabbed the regular salt from above the stove. 

No one else in the house moved, except Sal, who tried to ask what was going on, since she couldnt see the door from the couch. I pointed at her as I left, and my mom went to distract her.

Outside, Dave argued with my grandmother, who remained calm. You cant tell the dead that theyre dead straight out. You have to coax them into the realization, or the shock can cause a nasty haunting.

Why Cousin Dave still hung around around was quite a mystery, but he seemed more upset that no one had been there to pick him up from the ER.

I waited for days outside that hospital, Maggie! Where the hell was Sally? I thought for sure someone at work would tell her to come get me!

Do you remember why you were at the hospital, Dave? my grandmother asked gently.

Work accident, knocked my noggin good, but the doc patched me up quick, and then I waited for a long ass time shooting the breeze, thinking surely my wife would turn up, but she couldnt be bothered. I walked all the way home and Im out of smokes!

You walked forty-three miles from the hospital? my grandmother questioned him.

Mustve, since Im here, and couldnt catch a ride with my thumb out for nothing.

Dave, what happened at work? What knocked you in the head?

You can read it in the workmans comp report Im gonna file on Monday. Right now, I wanna speak to my wife. He turned to the house and my grandmother caught his arm.

Dave, hon, wait. Her voice hitched a bit, losing its calm. Sally is really upset over the accident. I think if you can explain it to me, maybe shell feel better, and be happy to see you. She stalled him.

I stepped closer, and he looked at me. For a moment, there was a strange feral look on his face, not human, but he came back quickly. I tried to ignore the gaping bloody hole in his head, but squished brain matter and a fragmented skull are tough to look away from.

Look, ifn I tell ya what happened, will ya give me a smoke and let me see Sal?

I snatched a pack of lights from the stoop, left by some mourner earlier. Tell us first, and then Ill hand em over. I waggled the pack, and his eyes lit up.

Deal. I was walking the factory, headed to lunch, when I heard a snap and looked up. I-beam chain had broken from the lead and the whole thing was coming down. I dodged and knocked my head on the conveyor. Rode in an ambulance to the hospital, got checked out, walked home. Smoke? He put his hand out.

You dodged? my grandmother prodded.

He paused, thinking. Yeah, I mean, the beam was falling, and I moved...wait. His brow creased. Wait His outstretched hand rose to his jaw, fingers feeling along his skin to his temple. His nails plunged into his head and dug deep into the viscera. I...I...I...wait.

I felt sick, stomach revolting at the disgusting sight of seeing a man touch his own brain. I dropped the smokes on the patio, and tried not to heave.

Daves mood changed as he went through the stages of grief. It was so clear on his face. But he bypassed acceptance and returned to anger. Shit.

Back up, my grandmother ordered, grabbing my arm and dragging me off the concrete into the grassy yard. 

Daves face grew darker and darker as he looked at the fallen smokes. His fingers dropped from his head wound, dragging blood and brain bits down his face and work shirt. He began to shake, hands twitching, as realization of his death took hold.

Then he laughed suddenly. Am I dead?

My grandmother nodded.

Well, shit. He cursed, raced to the door, kicking it in with supernatural force. SALLY! he roared.

Well, shit, my grandmother echoed. You wanna handle it, or should I?

Hes all yours, I said, hands up.

She sighed. Next time its your turn. 

Rolling back her sleeves, she marched into the house. People had started screaming at the sight of dead cousin Dave. Sally was the loudest, with her OH SHITS and WHAT THE HELL KINDA JOKE IS THIS. There was a scuffling noise over the shrieking, a few plates broke, and then my grandmother was back, dragging Dave by his shirt. She tossed him straight into the dirt. His smushed brain matter sloshed about in his head, and I was suddenly very glad shed taken this one.

He growled in the dirt, eyes dull and animalistic. Whatever part of his brain remained intact had gone feral.

A feral ghost becomes a ghoul if left unattended. Capable of nothing but destruction and terror, dead cousin Dave didnt deserve that fate. Hed start by eating Sally, and anyone else that got in the way, and possibly rampaging along the neighbors farms and woods before the souls hed consumed twisted him into some boogeyman that rednecks hunted on Big-Foot documentaries. Hed eat them, too.

I handed my grandmother the salt from my apron and she it chucked it at him. It bounced off his chest, spilling everywhere. His body fizzled, smoke drifting up, and he came back suddenly, focusing. Salt, the almighty cleanser.

Now, Maggie, listen, he protested. I deserve to see Sally

My grandmother ignored him, as she muttered under her breath, and stretched out her arm to me. I stepped over and took her hand. Together, we worked to send Mr. David Michael Willis to a better place.

Sally hit the threshold of the kitchen door then. Seeing her smoking husband covered in copious amounts of salt stopped her. Oh, that explains it, she said. Dont worry, honey. Im getting a helluva settlement from your work. Ill be fine! You be good, ya hear? She waved farewell to her husband sadly and retreated back inside, probably for the vodka shed stashed in the pantry earlier.

Theres no door, no lightshow, for a spirit that doesnt want to leave. It becomes a feat of willpower to push them across to the other realm. At some point, they generally realize its for the best, and complete the journey on their own.

Not dead cousin Dave. He dug his hands into the grass, and fought us every inch of the way. At some point, I considered kicking him in the head, just to break his grip on the ground.

Finally, after long moments of wishing him gone, his legs faded, dissolving away. He gave up hope then, knowing hed lost, and looked at us. Sorry for the trouble. Tell Sally I love her.

I nodded, and the wind kicked up. Dave fell in on himself, before he vanished. The breeze blew the salt across the yard.

Well, that was a struggle, I muttered, taking a deep breath.

My grandmother clapped her hands together. Touching him was like holding a live wire.

Howd you do that anyway? Ghosts arent solid.

Lots of practice, she replied.

 Together, we stepped back into the house and over Brenda, still on the floor. The kitchen door closed, dead cousin Dave found peace, and I found that I didnt hate the taste of vodka.

Years later, we laugh at the story, but his sloshing brain pan still makes me queasy. I have no wish to ever see it again.

[Heres to you, Cousin Dave. Dont come back.](http://fb.com/subject3600writing)

<TEXT> (Thank you for the amazing comments so far. Tomorrow, my grandmother argues with dead Cousin Dave, but today I wanted to warn you against wandering spirits.)




**Theres a woman in the barn. She isnt alive.**

There was another lady of no relation to me that had secrets of her own. (To be fair, Ive seldom met a woman who isnt magic in some form, but thats just the way of it.) This one lived next door in an old style ranch home with a wraparound porch. She tended chickens, had a large barn, and her acreage connected to ours in the woods. Her name was Shirley, a light worker with the most legendary pound cake recipe Ive ever tasted. There was power in her lemon glaze.

Her husband died many years before I met her, but it didnt stop him from visiting on occasion. He liked the smell of her cooking. It always brought him back, sometimes to the rocker just outside the kitchen window, and sometimes to the dining table, the chair settling under his invisible weight.

Shirley taught me how to help anyone that asked, dead or alive, and how to bake the best pecan pie youve ever tasted. Despite the work Id done with Shirley, and whatever help Id given the dead, it still unnerved me a bit to actually see a spirit whole. I was not ready to help them on my own.

Each person capable sees spirits differently. Usually they float in the corner of my vision, unclear. I speak to them, and they reply in emotions, images, and sometimes smells. I rarely get to choose how they appear. Now that Im older, I have requests, which most will follow, such as: No frightening me, or my houseguests, no messing with the dogs, and no hiding in the corners. It works out most of the time.

But I explain this, to prove that its not normal for a spirit to appear whole to me. I have never by choice opened my third eye to see them. Even young as I was, at fourteen, this barn lady should not have been able to get through my shields to be seen.

But she did.

Heres the one rule with spirits. If you cant or wont help, dont acknowledge them. If you arent trained to recognize good or bad beings, and you give one attention, youre going to deal with the consequences, like it or not.

I screw up a lot.

My bedroom window faced Miss Shirleys barn. And the hay door to the second floor loft where the ghostly woman stood perfectly framed was in sight while I lie in bed. Confused, sleepy, and not thinking, I peered out the window that night, through the open blinds, and from across the distance our gazes met. 

She flashed to my window, peering in. Long red hair, washed out in the moonlight, paper pale skin, and a gown out of style for decades, didnt help hide the fact that she was dead. Of course, twin black caves where her eyes should have sat didnt help either. It looked like someone had scooped out the muscle, jelly, and everything else in the eye socket and left it empty. I looked straight into her skull.

That only confirmed that I saw her. She entered my room and pressed herself against my bed edge, peering down. I did not move, only continued staring out the window. From my peripheral, I watched her jaw move, but heard no words.

Her presence explained my non-working nightlight from earlier that evening. The trend of the bulb blowing out on nights I would have visits became an early warning system for me. (Fourteen and still sleeping with a nightlight? I know, but if you had visitors like I did)

I found sleep eventually by turning my back to her, and facing the wall. In the morning, I rolled over and found her still in position. As I prepared for the day, she followed me through the house.

Have you ever showered with a ghost? Its awkward.

Mom wouldnt let me run to Miss Shirleys until late morning, and as I couldnt explain to her why I needed to go visit immediately without giving the spirit more attention, I reluctantly sat at the kitchen table, eating breakfast while pointedly ignoring the woman staring at my face from three inches away, if anything with eyeless sockets can stare.

Eventually through our kitchen windows, Shirley made an appearance, throwing grain and gravel bits about in her chicken coop, and Mom let me dart over.

I didnt need to explain to Miss Shirley. She saw the lady trailing behind me, and welcomed me into her own kitchen. No one gets past Shirleys defenses, maintained by her late husband, so the woman remained outside on the porch, pressing her face to the window.

Shirley placed a pan on the stove top, dropped some butter in, and counted to three. With a small groan, the dining table chair shifted, and her husbands cologne floated through the kitchen.

Whats she want, Harold? she asked the air. The answer came in a series of images, a donkey in the woods, laid up in a thorn thicket, sides heaving. Shirley removed the butter from the heat.

So thats where Josie got to, she muttered. Whats the lady want in return? she asked Harold. New images, the barn, a sleeping donkey. Shirley shrugged, and asked Harold if hed mind a new farm ghost. Apparently, he didnt.

Ill save the words, and tell you that we found the donkey a half mile out in the woods. She gone to drop her foal, after escaping the barn. Shirley cursed as she cut Josie free of the bramble, and led mother and child back to a dry bed of hay. Shirley gained a new barn ghost that day, and the lady became a normal part of my visits. I still cant explain the eyes, though. She never talked about it.

The point is, sometimes ghosts want nothing more than to help.

My house ghost, Quincy, helps by reminding me when Ive left the iron plugged in or forgotten a bill. He keeps out curious sprites, and teases the dog. Hes harmless. Easily pissed off, but harmless.

But not all are, and as we drift closer to Halloween, as the veil thins, theres a great chance youll come across something not so benevolent. Carry white sage, or clover, or even dried beans in your pockets. Dont invite anything in. And dont answer a door more than once, if nothing was there the first time.

Ive made enough mistakes in my dealings for everyone. While the story above ended well enough, it doesnt nail home the warning that the other realm isnt something to mess with. So lets fix that.

The same woods we found Josie in, connects with my dads five acres of trees. Shirley had another three or so, making it one giant playground for a child.

I had that land memorized, spending a grand majority of my free days walking it with Pebbles, the cat. That great purring, drooling beast usually joined me for the first twenty minutes or so, before shed find something more interesting to do than trudging through underbrush and dart off.

This day though, after a long night of rain storms, she stayed by my side much longer than I expected, given the wet leaves and mud.

Wed just reached the first in a series of gentle slopes down to a usually dry creek bed, when I saw something strange: A little girl playing among the trees.

I called out, but she didnt turn. Slowly, Pebbles and I made our way forward, the grey cat darting back and forth between my path. I looked down to watch my step, and made it about twenty more feet before glancing up. The girl had moved to the far side of the creek, still playing with something in the muck. I called out again, but she didnt look up.
Something felt off, but so far Id lived through all my adventures, and thought myself invincible.

I continued down the slope to the creek bed. The rainfall from the night before had filled it slightly, and the water rushed past, maybe a couple of feet high. The girl remained just across the water. I called out again, and this time she responded.

She stood from her crouch, looking down with her hair over her face. Her dress seemed too clean for playing in the mud, her shoes and socks too dry. That she was alone and so young didnt phase me as Id been running amok in these woods for many years on my own. But the cleanliness and her reluctance to answer raised the hairs on my arms.

I took a step back, prepared to run when Pebbles yowled. She jumped in my arms unexpectedly, and I nearly didnt catch her. She latched onto me through my flannel jacket, and yowled again.

I backed up farther, not turning my back on whatever stood before me, and tripped over a tree root. Pebbles didnt appreciate falling. She kicked free, landed lightly, and dashed into the underbrush.

I knocked the air from my lungs as my back hit the ground, and lay there dazed. The girl appeared above me.

Except it wasnt a girl anymore. Her mouth stretched the length of her face and needle-thin fangs slid from behind her lips.

I screamed.

Her smile widened, and the forest grew dark. My vision held only her, and I wondered what being eaten felt like.

A grey fluffy blur launched itself over me and into the monster. Together the two flew backwards and into the creek bed. A splash from out of sight, and then a very angry Pebbles reappeared crawling up the bank and onto mostly dry ground. The poor cat was soaked.

I offered to carry her, but she huffed water, shook what she could from her coat and stalked off towards the house. I thought it best to follow.

Running water cleanses anything. Simple, and proven effective, though Pebbles didnt appreciate learning it firsthand.

Take what you will from this, but be safe this October. If youre going to traverse the woods, take an animal friend; Theyre smarter than you. Stay to the path, and dont chase strangers. Dont acknowledge anything you cant help. 

[And for the love of life, dont make eye contact.](http://fb.com/subject3600writing)

**Things My Grandmother Taught Me**

My grandmother always said if theyre polite enough to knock, then they deserve your answer. She changed her mind after Death came to dinner.

What Ive seen from taking her advice has shaped my life and my own workings. It also explains why I answered the damn door.

Around my eleventh birthday, after many years of cooking subtle magics and sweeping ghosts out of the corners of my grandmothers home, someone knocked.

My family was gathered for Sunday Supper once more, a tradition we kept long past its welcome. The house felt a little more crowded than normal, with the addition of my new Aunt Brenda, and her daughter. My grandmother had also been taking care of her sickly sister for a year or two at this point, but Grand Aunt Esther tended to spend a large portion of her time in the hospital-style bed in the living room, where she could watch her soaps, fragile fingers cranking up the volume of Days of our Lives, when the noise in the house became too loud.

I handed Esther her supper plate, stretching my arms over the side bars of her bed. She clicked off the tv before looking at me. You know how some women age so gracefully that you can see the beauty from decades before? That wasnt Grand Aunt Esther. The woman was terrifying. Her eyes drooped, milky and cataract-filled. Her lips were constantly chapped, and her nails were yellow. Her white hair had grown so thin I could see her veiny scalp. Coming up on her in the dark was worse than a horror movie. She looked like a Cattawail, the Southern version of a Banshee. She screeched like one, too.

As Aunt Esther took her plate, she peered at me, and said, Get the door. Shes here to talk to me.

I retreated quickly, ignoring her nonsense. I was about to remove my apron and carry the mashed potatoes to the dining table when I heard it. Three quiet taps on the side door, just off the kitchen. Figuring it was a family member running late, I answered it. No one was there.

Did you get that door? Esther shrieked from the living room. My grandmother bustled into sight, curious what was taking me so long to bring the potatoes to the table. 

Door? she called back to her sister. I didnt hear anyone knocking.

Yeah, Mamaw, but theres no one there. I said, looking over my shoulder at my grandmother, as I shut the door.

There came another knocking, three quick taps. 

Let that woman in! Esther hollered from the living room.

I moved to open the door again, but my grandmother stopped me. 
How many knocks the first time? she asked.

Uh, three. I think.

My grandmother stood straighter. Dont open it.

She come in? Shes here to talk to me! Esther yelled out again. 
Before we could respond, Esther continued. Her wings aint gon fit through that door, though. Shouldve left them at home.

Wings? I asked. My grandmother shushed me.

Another knock on the door, three thumps. I flinched.

The knocking grew louder, persistent. They happened in threes, but the knocking became thudding, and then banging. The door shook.

What the hell is going on? my dad asked, walking out of the dining room. Is someone there?

My grandmother shook her head, shushing him, too. Esther continued yelling about her guest from the living room. The front door fell silent.

From the back door, someone else knocked, three taps. Brenda stood from the table and moved towards it.

Stop! my grandmother ordered.

Brenda paused. Why? Who is it?

The devil, came the whispered answer.

Brenda laughed, but at the serious look she received from my father, she stopped quickly. You think the devil is on your porch?

Devil knocks three times. So does Death. Open that door and theyll claim one of us.

The front door knocking started up again. The back door grew louder. Both started to shake. Angry at being ignored, tapping started at the windows, and then banging. The glass shook in the frame. I glanced around, and swore I saw giant eyes peering in at us.

My grandmother hurried into the kitchen, returning quickly with a bottle of white vinegar and a scoop of salt. As good as holy water, she promised, pouring the salt into the bottle, and swirling it around to mix.

Get under the table, she told me. I followed the command, pulling Brendas daughter with me, too. Children have no business with Death.

My grandmother pushed the curtain next to the door aside. Through the glass, she watched a shape form on the porch. Wings of black feathers unfurled from a body of shadow. A womans face became clear, red lips and black eyes, crying dark tears. She beckoned.

Death it is, my grandmother muttered.

Let her in, Esther yelled once more. Or Ill do it myself.

My dad went to stand guard, in case Esther followed through with her threat.

The banging grew louder against every entrance the house had, barely any pause between the three jolts. The doors bent under the force, the jambs groaning. The woman appeared then, in every glass surface, her face filling the windows. My grandmother dropped the curtain, backing up with a jump. A hurricane kicked up outside, and I watched as the window womans mouth dropped open. She howled with the wind. Her tears fell heavy.
The mirror above the fireplace cracked first, and then shattered, the shards flying over the dinner table, ruining our meal.

I crawled between the legs of a chair to better see, and sliced my hand on the glittering floor. My grandmother saw and cursed at the same time the kitchen door exploded inwards, and every lightbulb in the house burned out with a snap.

Death stood in the entrance, wings bleeding shadow off their pinions. Her lipstick nearly glowed in the sudden dark. The wet pools of ink where her eyes should have been searched the room. She smelled the blood. But as she tried to step forward there was a ripple in the doorway. With a hiss, she jerked back.

The bundle of herbs above the threshold caught fire, and fell from the nail holding it in place. Long pale fingers wrapped around the door jamb, the claws digging into the sheetrock and wood, which withered under her touch. Death entered, stepping over the ash of the herb bundle.

My grandmother stood firm. Get out of my house.

Death laughing is not a sound youll ever hear happily. Its a cacophony somewhere between bones crunching into dust from time passing and the snuffed out cries of a baby born still. But laugh she did, the winged creature with black tears and long claws.

When the mirth dried up, she aimed her dark gaze around the room, and spoke with a voice of gravel against sand. Wheres Esther? Death cocked her head to the side and smiled, white teeth bright against the darkened room.

My grandmother is no preacher, no devout lady of the lord. She attended church on Sunday when the roads were dry, prayed for rain or sun, and knew her folklore. Somewhere in her studies, she took to heart that salt and vinegar can banish near about anything you dont want around.

As Death leaned in for her, my grandmother splashed her holy mix right into that demons black eyes. But as she pulled her hands back, Death grabbed at my grandmother, and I knew enough to be afraid.

Remember how I said I didnt think much before acting, getting myself into all kinds of shit because of it? I think this tops all.

I scrambled out from my hiding place, my hand bleeding into the cracks of the pine floor. Stop! Dont take her! I screamed.

The demon grinned, and I realized this was its plan all along. Dont make deals with anything you dont understand, my grandmother had taught me, no matter what wall your back is against. In the next moment, I disregarded all advice shed ever given.

What will you give? the winged woman asked me.

A year, I vowed.

Five, it bargained.

Three, I promised. It considered, and nodded, letting my grandmother go.

The creature swooped towards me, snatching my wrist and licking the blood from my sliced hand. I met its eyes in that quick moment, and it was a glimpse into eternity. Ill never be able to explain exactly what I saw. An eleven year old mind protects itself. A magically inclined one even more so. But in those depths, hell peered out.

With a smile, she flew into the living room, a heavy wind knocking us all back. Esther screeched one last time, and then Death was gone, with two bounties, instead of the one it came for.

I had screwed up.

It took a long evening to clean up the glass and ruined food, to replace every bulb in the house, and then to wrap Esther in a sheet and make a call to have her body picked up. In death, her mouth and eyes gaped, jaw falling off-kilter. If I thought a glimpse of hell was scary, it was nothing compared to dead Aunt Esther.

My grandmother plucked mirror bits out of my hand, and wrapped the cut in soft bandages. It wouldnt need stitches. 

Whatd I do? I asked her.

You know right well what you did, she replied. 

Whats it mean? I rephrased.

She gets three years. Maybe at the end of your life, maybe whenever shes damned well pleased to take it. Not much we can do now. She leveled her eyes with mine, as she tucked the bandage end into place. Girl, dont you ever try to save me again. Death is gentle and quiet until it wants something. It only came knocking because it knew itd get something extra out of us. Next time it knocks, dont you dare answer.

I nodded.

Brenda, her daughter, and my uncle didnt hang around. It was a long time before they came back for a Sunday meal.

We never spoke much of that night again, other than my grandmother doling out advice for demon dealings and making sure I knew not to make an oath by blood. Blood work binding is dangerous stuff, and Ill never recommend it, no matter how strong the resulting bond is.

I tell this story now, in whole for the first time, because lately my windows have grown dark, and someone is looking in. Her eyes are black, her lips red, and she beckons.

Three years. She gets three years.

[4th Story: My Grandmother Isn't In This One](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/566swv/my_grandmother_isnt_in_this_one)

I can try to answer a few questions everyone had from the previous story. I never intended to make a series, but remembering my grandmother is comforting, so Ill dredge up a few more of her tales for you all. Thank you for the awesome response to the first tale.

A few readers asked how the scarecrows became her and my protectors. From things she taught me years later, Id wager a guess that it was the magic in the stitching. Her embroidery had real talent in it, and its a task that lets the mind wander. Maybe in her thoughts she wished for something to change in her life, or for someone to stop the abuse. Maybe she prayed for her grandchildren. Who knows? But the scarecrows faces seemed real when she finished her work.

Were there ghosts in the strawmen? Or was it just her magic at work? Im not sure. The way spirits flocked to her, I always assumed it was the first, with just a dash of the second. Ghosts sometimes like pretty things, and if her prayer for protection eked into her stitches, someone had to answer.

Her magical talents were dormant for many years, slipping out when least expected or most needed. I suspect the Scarecrows came to help when they did because her husband hurt me, and no one messed with the grandchildren. She didnt much care for herself. Her magic workings were subtle, but had strong results. Most of the time we didn't even know we were working up anything. But that's the way magic is.

One last thing before I start the next story. Someone (SwiffFiffteh, I think) noticed I never called my grandmothers husband my grandfather. Its true that I never acknowledged that man as anything but my Dads dad, and an abuser. If he had a grave, I wouldnt leave coins on it. Let him wander for eternity.

Thank you again for reading. I hope you enjoy the next story. My grandmother sure didnt.



**My Grandmother and the Rabbit Man**

Theres a reason my family doesnt keep rabbits.

Before the Scarecrows, before my birth, before the sons left home, and before the corn had been sown for the first time, my grandmother stood in the field of what would be her husbands final resting place, and sighed. She was six months pregnant for the second time, and hoped this one would stick. Several yards ahead, her husband turned the plough and started down a new aisle.

As she lifted the garden hoe to break up more of the dirt clods, her eyes focused, and she took in the disturbed rabbit den the plough had revealed. The mama was dead, cut to pieces under the plough, as were two kits. Four bunnies survived unscathed.

Im going to be frank here. Rabbits are great eating to poor farmers. A little small, but free meat is free meat. My grandmother gathered up the living kits and placed them gently in her apron pockets. They werent bigger than her palm, and the heat from each other would help keep them alive. Once settled, she gathered up the dead mother rabbit, but left the two dead kits for the dogs. Shed have the mama rabbit for supper.

Hanging dinner out of reach of the dogs, she dug out a chicken cage from the barn. Straw decorated the bottom of the makeshift bunny hutch, before she laid the still breathing babies inside. Luckily the goat had just dropped a kid, so theyd have plenty of milk. If they lived, she could breed them easy. She spent the rest of the day caring for the kits and skinning supper. It was light enough work for a pregnant woman and she welcomed the break.

She had the meat laid out on the counter, ready to be seasoned, when she saw a stranger kneeling in the field. He wore a nice suit, and a large flat-brimmed Panama. The hat was odd for this part of the state, where all shed ever seen were handmade straw affairs woven by women to protect from the sun. This strange man had money. Why was he in her field?

He must have felt her gaze because his head turned slowly to the window. The hat blocked the sun from his eyes, leaving everything above his mouth in shadow. His lips parted into a wide smile, and my grandmother jumped at the blood that dripped down his chin.

He stood, long legs untangling from beneath him. In the next moment, he was before her window, face pressed to the glass peering in. Pinprick white dots in black irises met her gaze, as she screamed. The man dropped from sight, but a blood smear remained on the glass.

She grasped her butchers knife, and turned towards the door, expecting the stranger to be inside at any moment.

Long minutes passed, and her heartbeat slowed. No man trespassed in her home.

Were she Catholic, she would have crossed herself before stepping out the kitchen door and into the driveway. No one was there. It was then, as she looked up at the bloody glass, she realized the man would have stood more than eight feet tall to look in as he did.

She darted into the field, one hand under her stomach to support my uncle, another waving a butcher knife in the air. What her husband made of the sight, well never really know, but Id bet he thought retribution was coming as she ran him down, screaming.

Babbling didnt really explain what had happened, so he helped her back to the house, cursing crazed pregnant women. As they passed over the little buried bunnies, my grandmother looked down to see large footprints in the dirt. She froze and pointed, and her husband glanced over to see the kits dug up, and mangled more than the plough could have managed. The dead rabbits had been skinned cleanly, the meat and bones chewed up, and blood spilled around the soil. He muttered about the dogs, and continued dragging his wife along.

In the cool of the kitchen, he sat her down and tried to ask what happened. But her eyes were locked on the cage that held the four live kits.

They too had been skinned, blood splattered in the straw, the bones sucked clean of all the meat.

She made chicken for dinner that night instead.

She called him the Rabbit Man. He never came back, except in her dreams. She carried dried beans in her apron pockets at all times, to throw at any bad spirits, and hung herb bundles tied together with thread above every door and window. I think her stitching did more to keep her safe, than the clover and blackberry leaves.

But I saw him once, before she ever mentioned him to me.

Like every country kid in the 90s, I got a pair of rabbits for Easter one year. I called the big grey one Bugs, and the little black one was named Bun, because it was all my brother could scream every time he got to hold her. 

My dad even promised to build a little hutch for them. But until he finished it, they lived in the kitchen in a dog kennel.

I did a lot of stupid shit as a kid. Who hasnt? Paired with the fact that I was a terrible liar, I got into a lot of trouble because of the dumb stuff I pulled. I generally just didnt think before I acted.

The night after I got the rabbits, my night light stopped working. Mom promised to drive into town the next day and get more bulbs, but Id have to do without for one night. I didnt much like it, but at seven years old,  I didnt get a say in the matter.

It was late, the house asleep, when a creaking in the hallway woke me. My bedroom was the last room in the hall, so unless Mom was checking on me, there shouldnt be anyone close to my room.

Tell the Rabbit Man that, though.

My door opened, and someone walked by, a shadow in the dark house. I tensed, but when nothing came for me, I got curious. I padded barefoot into the hall and past the bedrooms, where my parents and brother were sleeping, obvious bumps under their covers.

Someone moved in the kitchen. I moved slowly towards the noise.

The scariest movie Id seen at that point was Jurassic Park, and while it left me with an intense fear of the dark, I doubted that a dinosaur was in our kitchen. Of course, if I were wrong Id be dino-chow.

That thought made me pause, and I was about to turn back to get my parents when the Rabbit Man stepped around the corner and into sight.

He was tall, the top of his hat brushing our ceiling. He had to duck under the doorway as he came into view. His long limbs went on for miles, and his dark suit blended with the shadows. He smiled wide, white pinprick eyes leering down at me. Blood dripped off his lips.

I screamed.

The hallway light banished him. Mom scooped me up from behind, as Dad cleared the house with a rifle. He found no one, but the scene in the kitchen gave him a shock.

Bugs and Bun had been skinned, bones sucked clean of any meat, and the newspaper lining soaked in their blood.

None of us slept well that week.

Mom recounted the tale to my grandmother the following Sunday. She grew pale, as she told us her own story.

Suffice it to say, none of us ever owned rabbits ever again.

<TEXT> My grandmother was a witch.

She grew up in the 20s, in Mobile, AL, married young and moved to a small county to be a farmers wife. Five boys and an abusive husband wore her down, and her talents went dormant. There were little things sure, like her ability to charm snakes out of the driveway and back into the fields, instead of beheading them with a garden hoe and letting the bodies twitch until sundown, as was her husbands wont. Or her skill at cleaning a catfish from the pond and having it boned, breaded, and fried up in record time. I think she charmed the fish as well, right onto the line, enchanted liver on the hook beckoning them to their deaths. I didnt mind; that fish was good.

But she was a quiet, sad woman, with little sense, and a deadened predilection to speak with ghosts. Her house was full of them.

Sometimes I think it was the evilness that her husband harbored. Or maybe it was the loneliness that set in after her 5 sons left home and no one was there to distract her from the abuse. But whatever it was, and whatever talents she had, ghosts flocked to the house, attracted by something.

Some were friendly, I think. Most were not.

She made acquaintance with them all, though; The fireplace haint, who blew sparks in the winter when the hearth was lit, the hallway spirit that lived in the hanging light and stared at me as I napped on the couch, the attic menaces that raced the length of the house with loud stomping that interrupted all conversation below them, and the cornfield scarecrows.

Yeah, yeah, scarecrows, so overdone. But its nothing except the truth.

The cornfield stretched a football field or longer, or so it seemed to me at five years old. Bordered by the house on one side, the highway at the front, and miles of forest on the other two ends, to a small child, it was a jungle to be lost in. I loved running in the stalks. The saddest times were when I visited in the winter and early spring, when the stalks were dead and gone, and the tract sat empty.

The scarecrows, though, they stood tall year round.

Poor farmers make scarecrows out of rotted fence posts or long tree branches, torn clothing too ripped to be patched, and straw and grasses. The only bit of talent in making the things, other than the skill at foraging materials, is the burlap faces. My grandmothers talent at embroidery was unparalleled and I think her magic eked into the stitching. Her scarecrows, despite their uneven bodies, and strange limbs, had real features on their flat sack faces. 

It was terrifying, each time I ran through the stalks and came upon one without warning. He would tower over me, high on his tree branch, arms outstretched, as he warded his kingdom. Each time I came upon them, Id freeze, look up the long length of the straw-filled body, and offer a little prayer. Sorry Mr. SCrow, didnt mean to bother you. And each time, those black stitched features would shift a little, becoming more real, as the scarecrow smiled down at a young child playing make-believe in the cornfield.

There were five of them in total. From the kitchen window, I could see over the corn, see them all on their long poles. But no matter how often I checked, no matter how I tried to memorize where they stood so Id stop coming across them when I played in the field, once I was among the stalks, they seemed to move, coming out of nowhere to surprise me. Their faces, so real and serene, were never anything but benevolent, but still, after the adventures in the haunted house, I found myself unlikely to mess with anything on the property.

Maybe it was good thing I was so respectful of the cornfield guardians.

My grandmothers abusive husband was quick to anger. Maybe the sons forgot, or maybe they never told their wives how their father beat them, but for some reason, that haunted house was always full of grandchildren visiting. Sometimes I attended church with them, and stayed at the house afterwards until early evening. My parents would show up for Sunday supper and Id leave afterwards with them. Only once did I see what my grandmother suffered through.

It was a Sunday when his anger flared.

My grandmother had started her cooking, flour, meal, and spices along the counter. I helped in the kitchen, with my little apron, flowers embroidered along the bib. It kept my Sunday school dresses clean. I think it must have been the smell of of burnt cornbread, or maybe it was the hell fire and brimstone sermon thatd been delivered earlier in the day--being reminded that succumbing to wrath was a surefire way to sit at the devils table for eternity probably didnt help his temperament--that set the man off, but as he stomped into the kitchen yelling, my grandmother seemed to shrink. She clapped the extra flour off her hands and turned towards her abuser. He grew taller, his yelling louder. I pressed my hands over my ears, and hid behind my grandmother. She would protect me.

He must have struck her. She fell back against the counter, knocking me down. I didnt hear her cry over the ringing in my head. I did feel her shift, scoop me up, and shoulder past her husband. I was outside in the next moment.
Run into the corn, my grandmother whispered, as she set me down. I grabbed her hand and started to the field, but he loomed out of the door and snatched at my grandmothers hair, dragging her back into the house by the gray strands. She screamed. I ran.

I didnt quite understand what was happening. I only ran. Red drops fell onto my apron, marring the embroidery. Id cracked my temple on the counter as shed fallen on me.

Out of the stalks, he appeared and I knelt before him. Looking up into his stitched face so far above me, I repeated my prayer. If ghosts were real, maybe Id be safe.

Please Mr. Scrow. Help. I laid down and cried into the soil.

There was a cracking noise, like limbs breaking, followed by a rustling. Terrified, I buried my head in my arms and refused to look. Something moved near me and then away through the corn. Across the field, four more cracks sounded, like gunshots in the air.

I still dont know what happened. Scared, and dizzy, I laid in the dirt until my grandmother found me, asleep in the field, hours later. She followed the trail of broken stalks. She wiped my bloody face with my ruined apron, and said everything would be alright now. Above us the scarecrow hung. He winked at me as she carried me away.

Her black eye eventually healed, but she never burned another loaf of cornbread. The ghosts in the house grew more numerous, and the Sunday Suppers were happier. She never spoke of that day again, and I never asked.

She still let me help in the kitchen, even made me a brand new apron to protect my little dresses. As I measured flour, and kneaded dough, my eyes would wander to the window, and the scarecrows that loomed over the field. All six of them.
