<TEXT> Of the estimated four billion American chestnut trees that once grew from Maine to Georgia, only a remnant survive today. The species was nearly wiped out by chestnut blight, a devastating disease caused by the exotic fungal pathogen Cryphonectria parasitica. This fungus was accidentally introduced into the United States over a century ago as people began to import Asian species of chestnut. It reduced the American chestnut from the dominant canopy species in the eastern forests to little more than a rare shrub. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Across 13 studies, we found that the simple act of scheduling makes otherwise fun tasks feel more like work. It also decreases how much we enjoy them.

For example, in one, we asked participants to imagine grabbing a coffee with a friend. Half of the participants imagined that they planned this gathering a few days in advance and put it on their calendar, while the other half were told that they decided to grab a coffee on the fly. We found that this simple, relaxing activity was associated more with work-like qualities (obligation, effortful, work) when it was scheduled, compared with when it was impromptu. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Further complicating the "freedom" of cage-free and free-range enclosures, hens will peck one another in an effort to establish a dominance order.... In flocks of 100,000 or more chickens, the least dominant birds can be subjected to so much pecking from other hens that their welfare is clearly worse than it would be in an enriched cage. ... Egg producers limit the damage that birds can do to each other by trimming off the sharp tip of their beak (which is also controversial). Even still, higher mortality from pecking gets treated as a cost of business in cage-free production facilities.

Many of these epibionts have only rarely been observed by scientists before  probably because theyve only been found attached to sea turtles. In addition, many of these epibionts have bizarre adaptations that let them live life as hitchhikers.

 We discovered hermaphroditic barnacles that use their heads to cement themselves to the sea turtles shell....  a sea turtle resting on the sea floor with a shell covered in barnacles could very easily be mistaken for a rock. </TEXT>

In virtually every case, the jocks and popular teens did not use more substances, have more sexual partners, or break the rules any more than all the other kids at school. But they were perceived as doing all these risky behaviors a lot.
And these misperceptions also ran in the opposite direction. Take studying, for example  a decidedly less cool thing to do during adolescence. Teens over-attributed studying to the nerds by far, even though the nerds really didnt study more than anyone else in the school.

In short, the teens saw their peers through a caricatured lens.  </TEXT>

Sitzpinkler: a man who pees sitting down. The noun is a compound of Sitz (seat), pinkeln (to pee), and -er (a male-specific suffix). This word is part of a series of lighthearted wuss definitions, which includes Abschiedsheuler (a man who wails at farewells) and Sockenfalter (a man who folds his socks). </TEXT>
