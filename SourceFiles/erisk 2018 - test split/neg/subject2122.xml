<TEXT> Why didn't Rodrigues attempt to leave Japan and go back home to Portugal? If he really was the last priest and he left, then the Inquisitor will have met his goal as Christianity will indeed remain a very minor religion. The Inquisitor could also bank on the chance that Rodrigues would tell fellow priests that Christianity will never grow in Japan, thus discouraging further attempts at entering the country. 

Just really curious, since I was actually bummed out that he had to serve as a stooge for the Japanese for the rest of his life. </TEXT>

A game show sketch where Kyle plays a high schooler who want to take down seemingly dumb jock (Chris Pine) by asking him tough questions about what's going on in the world today. The plan backfires when it turns out he answers every question in a perfect, concise manner. Melissa and Pete play the other participants who also have beef with the jock. </TEXT>

<TEXT> La La Land- This is where I spent most of my time imagining a better movie!

Hidden Figures- I hope they stay there! (Hidden.) (This is where the audience would hiss probably.

Hacksaw Ridge- I liked it better when it was just called "Saw"!

Fences- Please make it bigger, Trump! (Audience hisses again)

Manchester by the Sea- Casey Affleck living in the shadow of an older brother. Original much?!

Hell or High Water- One-way ticket to the former, please!

Arrival- Where's the "Departure" sign?!

Lion- I'd rather get eaten by one than watch this movie!

Moonlight- Boyhood but with a gay, black male? (Eye roll). I'd make an actual joke but the audience members are being sissys after that Trump joke!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hanks- (Not a bad one in the episode, though the one where Hanks played Sully was kind of forgettable. Any questions? ;)

Chappelle- (Not a fan of Sheila Sovage, but everything else was great.)

Johannson- (Also not a fan of Shanice Goodwin. Solid all-around though.)

Baldwin- (Actually glad this wasn't a Trump-a-thon, as Baldwin proved why he's a good host. I'd watch the whole episode again, but I'd skip the fart sketch,)

Stewart- (Surprisingly a very good episode. They played well to Stewart's strengths.)

Louis CK- (The only thing I didn't like in this one was the O'Reilly/Trump sketch. I love me some Louis CK, so I may be a bit biased.)

Ansari- (I actually think the dirty talk sketch was overrated, but I can't wait to see Ansari host again. He was made for this.)

Robbie- (She did a better job than fellow summer movie breakout Chris Pratt did back in 2014. Not a bad sketch in this episode, though not a lot of highlights tbh.)

Fallon- (I'm glad that he didn't rely on Timberlake to cameo, since I feel that he uses him as a crutch. Solid episode.)

Affleck- (He wasn't too shabby, though Ben is a better fit for SNL than he is. He was very funny in the last sketch. New York Now was a drag, but I fully expect Chance the Rapper to host one day.)

Stone- (A bit disappointed since I'm a huge fan of hers, though not bad. Just ok. I only really remember "Posters" and the Nativity sketch.)

Miranda- (He's a very capable host, and I think we will see him again one day. His monologue was a blast and I usually hate singing ones. I have trouble remembering much else though besides that and the Poetry teacher sketch.)

Wiig- (Her second hosting stint on the show was better than her first, but I don't remember much besides the CNN and QVC sketches.)

Jones- (Not as bad as everyone says, though it is kind of forgettable.)

Blunt- (She deserved much better than this, as she was very game. Maybe she'll get a second chance when the Mary Poppins sequel comes out?)

Cumberbatch- (He does have comedy chops, but they really only worked in the sketch where Beck questions why everyone thinks he's hot. Disappointing episode since it was the last one before the election.)

Spencer- (The second half was abysmal, and this would've ranked higher if said half was only ok.)

<TEXT> I'll use some comps.

Beck- Really brings the same Midwestern charm as Sudeikis yet is also capable at the weirdos Chris Parnell used to play. 

Kyle- Absurdist humor like Armisen but in a more millennial way

McKinnon- Can completely disappear into a character like Bill Hader

Strong- Maybe the best pure actress of the cast rn, like Kristen Wiig

Kenan- Can do it all, like Phil Hartman.

Bayer- Effective straight woman, more or less similar to Jane Curtin

Aidy- Can go over-the-top but remain grounded at the same time. Kind of like Will Ferrell.

Mikey- Solid utility guy. I actually see a bit of Chris Kattan and Seth Meyers in him when he was starting out.

Alex- Very good at impressions like Bill Hader yet his "Just bought a boat" character is Sudeikis-like

Pete- Good at carving out his identity like Chris Rock and Adam Sandler did (or any other standup on the show).

Melissa- Impressionist. 

Sasheer- Deadpan humor but I also think the show still doesn't know how to use her

Leslie- Big broad personality like Tracy Morgan

Bobby- Brings the most out of his appearances.

<TEXT> My take:

I've always considered Cecily Strong more of an actress rather than a comedian, as in a Phil Hartman way, and I believe that it's the other way around for McKinnon, which is why she overshadows Cecily a bit at times.

Kate will have some of the best comedy roles offered when she leaves, while I picture Cecily having the type of career Kristen Wiig has now (supporting roles in blockbusters, indie drama leads, etc.)

<TEXT> One of my favorite segments whenever a stand-up hosts is the monologue, since otherwise they are usually a:

1. Musical monologue
2. Interrupted by the cast who are doing impressions of the host/characters they've played before
3. Q A by the cast in the audience

They haven't been bad this season, though. The only monologues I don't remember at all are Emily Blunt's and Benedict Cumberbatch's. 

Anyway, it's refreshing to have a host just be themselves and entertain the audience for several minutes.

<TITLE> Any chance that Michael Pena hosts in March? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-23 05:08:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I think he's famous enough to get the chance to host in a character-actor-JK- Simmons kind of way. I mention March specifically because he has CHIPS comes out in late March and he'd have something to promote. Plus, it'd be nice to have someone of Mexican-descent do an impression of Mexico's president Enrique Pena Nieto since he has become under fire for meeting with Trump (Armisen could probably do it too though.) 

He did criticize SNL for letting Trump host awhile back. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It seems like he'll join Louis CK and Kevin Hart in "Repeat standup comedian SNL hosts." 

I believe that in a weird way, his style could be considered a mix of the two. He brings a lot of energy to the table in a Hart kind of way, yet he has a screen presence and a perspective that is very much his own like Louis CKs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Master of None parody where he plays Bobby Jindal**

Leslie as Denise. Melissa as Rachel. Pete/Alex/Mikey as Arnold.

**Good Morning Miami!**

**Millennial Concert Promoters**

Two millennials (Pete and Aziz), in desperate search for work, go around promoting the musical acts for Trump's inauguration. 

**Allied parody**
Beck plays a Bond type of spy and Cecily plays a Bond girl, where they mist rendezvous in order to share information. They meet up at a club where Aziz is doing standup. Aziz decides to do crowd work and picks the two of them, constantly interrupting them.

<TEXT> It got Best Picture because:

Room: Too small to win

Bridge of Spies: Nomination was more of a sign of respect to Spielberg and Hanks

Brooklyn: Not enough love in other categories

The Martian: No way was a sci-fi movie going to win

Mad Max: Fury Road: Amazing film, but it was more of a technical marvel in their eyes.

The Revenant: Too violent and polarizing. Inarritu had also recently won for Birdman.

The Big Short: Too comedic

Hence, Spotlight. But I agree. I'm not a big fan of the movie and it bored the hell out of me at many points.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with you on Ruffalo. He did a lot of mannerisms which made him stick out like a sore thumb in a movie that was going for realism.

Also, I didn't see any of the other nominees winning. Bridge of Spies was good but not great Spielberg, Mad Max: Fury Road was more of a technical accomplishment in the Academy's eyes, Brooklyn didn't get a lot of love in other categories, The Martian was too sci-fi, The Revenant was too love-it or hate-it within the Academy, Room was too small, and The Big Short was too comedic for them.

Hence, Spotlight. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They tend to go with a huge name or an SNL alum for the Christmas episode, and I think Jennifer Lawrence is just a bit more popular than Chris Pratt.

<DATE> 2016-09-26 21:20:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Starring Diego Luna (Y Tu Mama Tambien, upcoming Star Wars:Rogue One, Elysium), this dark comedy involves a computer hacker (Luna) and his crush next door, an older couple in financial hardship with an "opportunity" on the horizon, a marriage on the rocks, and a pair of bickering gangsters. Oh, and as the title suggests, almost everyone smokes or is trying to quit.

All of these stories will connect when a delivery of a data disc involving Swiss accounts by the computer hacker to a Russian mobster goes wrong. 

If you like the Coens, this one is worth checking out. Runtime of an hour and 30 minutes. In Spanish.

<TEXT> Well, at least Mad Max: Fury Road did ok enough and cleaned up at the Oscars. It's also done great in the home market.The Intern made some cash. Creed as well, but MGM was also involved so I'm guessing they took some profits. San Andreas was profitable, but I'm positive The Rock had a huge backend deal. The Conjuring series is a huge cash cow, but James Wan is starting to get PAID.

Eh, they could be Paramount. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Big Short was too comedic.

Mad Max: Fury Road was a technical marvel and not much else in the eyes of the voters. 

Room was too small to win. 

The Martian was well-done but it's sci-fi which they look down at.
 
The Revenant was thematically hollow according to the voters.

Bridge of Spies was good but the nomination was more of a sign of respect to Spielberg and Hanks.

Brooklyn didn't really have a chance in the other categories besides Best Picture, so a win there had no chance.

Spotlight may not have been very cinematic, but it dealt with an important social issue and had many respected actors in the cast (actors make up the biggest part of the Academy).

For example, Brie Larson's character in that could've easily been the catty, slithery ex-girlfriend who tries to ruin Sutter's life. But she genuinely cares for him after the breakup. I really liked seeing that. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-04-30 23:46:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Here's a few I'd like to see him work with:

David Fincher: His movies seem like the type Leo would be interested in doing. Also, as much as I like Scorsese, Shutter Island would've been even better if Finch was at the helm for that one instead of Marty. Finch also has a good track record with A-listers (Pitt, Blanchett, Affleck).

Paul Thomas Anderson: They almost collaborated for Boogie Nights, and maybe Leo would work with him now that he's more accomplished. His last two movies have both been with Joaquin Phoenix, so maybe those two have THEIR own Scorsese-Leo relationship going on.

The Coens: Yes, they are more keen to work with character actors (Brolin, Turturro, Lee Jones, Goodman) rather than movie stars (apart from Clooney, Pitt, and Nic Cage). However, the brothers have proven time and again that they know how to write memorable characters, which I'm guessing is one of the things Leo takes in consideration. Plus, it'd be refreshing to see Leo do something a little lighter in tone and production after The Revenant. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-04-11 07:59:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> These were two of my favorite movies of this past year, and I think they each took an interesting approach to the biopic genre. The End of The Tour examined DFW from David Lipsky's perspective over the course of a week, while Love   Mercy focused on two specific time periods of Brian Wilson's life. They each also had good performances, with Jason Segel showing some dramatic chops in TEoTT and the underappreciated Paul Dano in L M (Eisenberg and Cusack also did a good job.)

I'm already planning on watching I'm Not There since it is somewhat similar to L M. Any other good recommendations? </TEXT>

<TITLE> How would you guys rank Alexander Payne's films? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-21 07:46:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> From best to worst:

1. The Descendants- Payne is great at getting good performances from his actors, and this one is a great example. After a while, I started to forget that it's George Clooney and saw a middle-aged man who's trying to connect with his daughters after his wife lands in a coma, while at the same time having to deal with the family's land. I think it's one of his best performances. Shailene Woodley also shines in what would turnout to be a breakout role for her. Her slacker boyfriend also steals many scenes in which he's featured. 

2. About Schmidt- Again, I started to forget that Jack Nicholson was Jack Nicholson and saw a retired guy who's dealing with the pitfalls that retirement can bring. His monologues whenever he's writing to the kid he's sponsoring in Africa are a highlight, as they change from heartening to dark in a matter of seconds. 

3. Citizen Ruth- I cannot imagine what people would think of this movie if it came out today, since even just describing it as an "abortion satire" would turn a lot of people off. Laura Dern does well as the title character, and the supporting cast as well. I really feel this movie deserves to be better-known, as it is very timely. And to top it off, this was Payne's directorial debut, so he got off to a great start in Hollywood.

4. Sideways- I feel like this one might be a tad uneven, but I still enjoyed this one. Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church are very well-suited for their roles, as are Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh. And the last half-hour is one of the funniest half-hours I've ever seen, with Giammati's character having to break into a house and Haden Church intentionally crashing Giammati's car.

5. Election- I liked this movie. But I do feel it is a bit overrated. The narration felt tiresome to me, as it felt that every other scene in the movie had it. And I felt that is was more of the "amusing" kind of funny, instead of "laughing out loud." Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon, do deliver however. I do like the satirical aspect of elections and politics featured in the movie, however.

6. Nebraska- Will Forte is a relevation in this movie, showing some dramatic chops. And Bruce Dern is very good in one of his best performances in a while. However, I do think the movie moves very slow and is really just plain amusing. It's still good, but I could live without seeing it again. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been hearing a lot lately that Twitter is planning on changing their character limit up to 10,000. That may prove to be unwise, but it shows that they may be considering increasing it to another limit in the future.

I think MLB should pounce in on this. A lot of people who don't follow baseball would wonder why the limit is 162 instead of 140. This would further increase awareness of the game, especially amongst young people. They are the main demographic of Twitter after all, and MLB has lost a lot of younger sports fans, due to the increase of popularity of the NHL and NBA. 

This may sound very gimmicky, but I think it's one that could work. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Trainspotting is a good example. The scene where Renton is overdosing on heroin and is close to dying moves slowly and is rather somber. Lou Reed's Perfect Day also really helps to accent that. Renton is the main focus of this scene and is shown to be perfectly still.

The scene immediately after shows Renton being locked in his room by his parents. As soon as that happens, techno music that is fast, throbbing and pulsating starts playing, which means his withdrawal will clearly be excruciating (which it is). The rest of that scene is also pretty frantic with all the other characters coming in to the picture as well. Renton is also having the biggest freakout of his life up to this point.

I've always found the pairing of these two scenes fascinating, as it shows two different sides of drug addiction that I'm sure many users go through. Both are incredibly painful, but each of them are different stylistically speaking (one is rather still, the other can be frenetic). Any other movies that have two of these types of  scenes back-to-back? </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me, this would have to be the Coens' No Country for Old Men. The first time I saw it, I thought it was a good thriller but was skeptical about its Best Picture status. However, after some scoping around on the Internet, I learned that it was best to view it from the perspective of Sheriff Ed Tom (Tommy Lee Jones' character).

And holy crap.

The movie made a helluva a lot more sense once I viewed it in that angle. I told a friend who had the same reaction that I had when he first viewed it the same thing and he also saw the genius of it.

You could also say the same thing about The Big Lebowski, since I was cracking up the second time around.

Are there any other movies out there that could also have a similar type of experience? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think they made the right call when they decided to expand the field to ten and an even better one when they changed it to anywhere besides 5 and 10, since some years might not be so great in film. But what movies do you guys think might've made the cut anyway if they stuck with five nominees? 

Keep in mind that I'm viewing this from THEIR perspective.

Here's my take:

2009:

Avatar

The Hurt Locker

Inglorious Basterds

An Education

(wild card)

2010:

The King's Speech

Black Swan

The Social Network

The Fighter

Either True Grit or 127 Hours (Really good year for movies though, imo)

2011:

The Artist

Midnight in Paris

The Help

The Tree of Life

Hugo

2012:

Argo

Django Unchained

Life of Pi

Lincoln

Zero Dark Thirty or Les Miserables

2013:

12 Years a Slave

The Wolf of Wall Street

Dallas Buyers Club

Gravity

American Hustle (Her could be here as well, though)

2014:

Birdman

Boyhood

The Imitation Game or The Theory of Everything

American Sniper

<TITLE> Idea: Let's try to guess which film studio financed and distributed each of Vince's films. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-13 05:52:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Head On: 20th Century Fox
Vince had a meeting with Tom Rothman (playing himself) in Season 5 regarding Smoke Jumpers. Rothman was a studio head at FOX at the time the episode aired (now at Sony). He also said that he liked making Head On with Vince as it was a hit for them and for Vince as well, since it gave his career a big boost.

Queens Boulevard: Lionsgate
I'm going on a bit of a limb here, but I have a feeling it might be them. I thought it could The Weinstein Company since Harvey Scissorhands is nicknamed that for a reason, but then I remembered that he had a grudge against Vince and E (mainly E) before then. It really could be any mini-major studio, since it doesn't look like the type of movie a major would distribute, so this one's open to interpretation. Plus, this was way before Lionsgate had the Hunger Games, so they would really care about protecting their investments by going with whatever version of a test screening of QB tested well.

Aquaman: Warner Bros.

Medellin: Independently financed but Weinst...er...Weingard bought it for a dollar. So I guess this one belongs to The Weinstein Company.

Smoke Jumpers: Warner Bros.

Alan bought the script and he was still the studio head there when he died.

Gatsby: WB or Paramount

This one could go either way. Martin Scorsese probably did this after Shutter Island, which was at Paramount. However, they may have had only enough money to finance one of Marty's movies at a time. Plus, Marty did Goodfellas and The Departed with WB, so they may continue this relationship in the show's universe. Also, the real-life adaptation of The Great Gatsby (with Leo) was also at WB.

Ferrari: Universal

We don't know much about the movie, so this is a pure guess. Judging from the poster however, it really seems like a type of movie they would release. 

The Takeover: Fox

Same as Ferrari, but also judging from the Season 7 premiere, I got a feeling that this is something right up their alley.

Air-Walker: Whatever studio Dana was working at

Today, Disney owns Marvel Studios, so any Marvel movie coming from them is distributed by The Mouse House. However, this episode still takes place in 2010, so a lot of other studios around town still had rights to many Marvel characters. Dana was also heavily involved in the pre-production of it, so if anybody remembers where she was working at around this time, comment below.

Hyde: Warner Bros.

John Ellis is the CEO of Time Warner in the show's universe and he hired Ari to run the studio.

I'm reaching a little bit here to start a discussion, but I really like this sub and I like contributing to it.

<TEXT> If I were Terry, I'd put Conforto in the DH slot, Yoenis and Lagares in center. That outfield in Kaufman is HUGE, and we need Lagares to cover a lot of ground out there. Their bullpen is very lights-out and a run can make all the difference between a win and a loss. And that run could come by a ball hit to center that only Lagares could get to.

Plus, Conforto has been struggling in the postseason aside from the home run in LA, and putting him in the DH slot could have him only focus on hitting. What do you guys think? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Anyone else think Billy Walsh is based on Michael Cimino (Deer Hunter, Heaven's Gate)? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-10-24 00:33:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> -Both experienced success with their first film, Daze for Billy Walsh and Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, and opened a lot of doors for both of them. Cimino was getting offers for a lot of movies after T   L and Walsh mentioned that his agent wanted him to do a studio movie when he was meeting our hero Vince for the lead in QB.

-Both experienced critical success with The Deer Hunter and Queens Boulevard. Walsh didn't win any Oscars for the movies (as far as we know) but both movies established the two of them as two of the best young directors of their generation. Walsh also said "This is my Deer Hunter, Wick" after the producer of the movie questioned him about the movie's running time of four hours at the premiere of the film at Sundance. The Deer Hunter is also a lengthy movie as well, clocking in at a little over three hours.

-Both experienced monumental failures in Heaven's Gate and Medellin. Both were critically and commercially unsuccessful and both also had lengthy running times. I've also read that Cimino was difficult on the set. One example being that he waited for hours to shoot just because he really liked a cloud in the sky for some reason and wanted to wait so it could it movie into the frame. And I think we all know how Walsh behaved during the production and post-production of Medellin.

- It's worth noting that Heaven's Gate bombed so badly (gaining only $3 million on a $44 million budget, which is non-adjusted) that it bankrupted an ENTIRE studio. Medellin cost $25 million to make and bankrupted Nicky Rubenstein, the sole financier of the project. Medellin went straight-to-DVD so I bet it didn't even come close to making its money back.

- However, I'm willing to bet that Medellin garnered a cult following later on in the show's universe. To me, it has that feeling of "it's so bad, it's good." The financier's son of Vince's Hyde in the movie version of the show (I forget his name) did mention that he liked it, so maybe it has a small legion of fans. Heaven's Gate has had a similar following, where many different cuts and edits of the movie have been made, and even some of them have been acclaimed.

- Both also did some work later on, but never attained the same level as their masterpiece. Walsh did the monkey cartoon with Drama, even though it got cancelled. Cimino did do a couple more films after Heaven's Gate, but all of them were flops, and he hasn't made a movie since 1996.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Head On: Some critics liked this movie, while others didn't. I'd say it'd probably be around 70% on RT

"Despite a somewhat predictable plot, Vincent Chase and Jessica Alba give alluring performances in this crime thriller."

Queens Boulevard:

"With a tour de force performance from its lead and confident directing from its auteur, Queens Boulevard is one of the year's best independent films."

Aquaman:

"With exhilarating action sequences, stunning set pieces, and solid performances from the cast, James Cameron adds another masterpiece to his already impressive filmography."

Medellin:

"Medellin's ambition cannot be saved by it's poor pacing, direction, overly long running time, lackluster performances and directing."

Gatsby:

"With a comeback performance from Vincent Chase, Martin Scorsese delivers a stellar adaptation of an American classic."

Ferrari:

"Ferrari delivers a good look at the title subject's persona thanks to its lead and Darabont's direction.

The Takeover:

"While some may see it as by-the-numbers, the movie still delivers solid action sequences that are more than the sum of its parts."

Hyde:

"An ambitious but risky project delivers on all fronts, with special regards to its set pieces and supporting performances." </TEXT>

<TITLE> Anybody know if Pacific Rim made a profit? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-10-04 10:17:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm starting to think that it probably didn't. The movie cost $190 million to make and made $410 million by the end of its run. However, three-quarters of that final sum was made internationally and studios keep less of those profits than the ones in America. The movie did do pretty well in China but again, the studio only keeps 25% of that. And there is also marketing costs to apply as well.

Then again, I'd imagine there weren't any back-end deals aside from del Toro, since this was Charlie Hunnam's first lead role in a blockbuster and thus didn't have any leverage and hardly anyone else in the cast could be considered a movie star. One of the best ways to keep more of the profits is to limit back-end deals so you won't have to shell out a ton of money in participations.

I'm just curious because I really get the feeling that it didn't, unless it took the DVD market by storm. I'm also curious because the sequel for the movie just got postponed and a lack of profits may be one of the reasons it did. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've asked before on this subreddit if there are any real-life actors whose current career trajectory resembles Vincent's at the beginning. Someone commented Miles Teller and I do see a couple of similarities.

JAG/The Unusuals-Guest spot on a television show. JAG lasted way longer, however.

A Walk To Remember/Divergent movie series- Supporting role in a movie anchored by an up-and-coming female actress (Mandy Moore/Shailene Woodley). Divergent is a way bigger film in scale though and AWTR was only a modest hit.

Head On/The Spectacular Now- Breakthrough movie that made Hollywood pay attention to both actors. Also co-starred with a up and coming young actress (Jessica Alba at the time, Shailene Woodley now)

Matterhorn/That Awkward Moment or Two Night Stand- Middling movie. E said the script for Matterhorn sucked and he's a good judge of quality. Vince didn't actually go through with Matterhorn, as we all know now.

Queens Boulevard/Whiplash- Critically acclaimed indie flick. Vince got a lot of praise for QB. Teller did too, even though he was somewhat overshadowed by JK Simmons.

Aquaman/Fantastic Four- Commercially viable popcorn flick. Both also based on comic books. Hopefully Teller doesn't anger any FOX executives like Vince did with WB and be replaced by another young actor haha

Medellin/Bleed For This- Biographical drama which followed a studio film. Possible awards contender. Hopefully Teller goes through a much better experience with this one than Vince did with Medellin. Also has a relatively small budget.

Many young actors follow a path similar to this one. I don't have any comp for Arms and The Dudes since Vince never did a comedy haha. What do you guys think?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think he is having a very interesting season. He leads the Astros in home runs with 19 as of today, which is saying something since they lead the league in home runs. However, his average is just a tad below .200 and his OBP is .279. He also has plenty of strikeouts with 61, compared to 24 walks. He only has one stolen base, so he doesn't have a lot of speed. His defense and throwing arm are only average.

But those 19 home runs tho...especially in today's environment.

Medellin: $0 (He sold his house to buy the script, and he and E just wanted to make their money back when they were selling the movie at Cannes)

Advance Check for Lost in The Clouds: $2,000,000

Charlie's Skater Show: $10,000

Gambling on Soccer Games: $100,000

Smokejumpers: $2,500,000 (Ari said that Dana will pay Vince his quote, which was probably what he got for Aquaman. However, Vince only got half of that money when he signed the contract and the rest of it later on. It can be assumed that a similar deal happened here.)

Gatsby: $4,000,000 (Vince probably had to take a small paycut so Marty could cast him, since Vince's career was in shambles at this point.)

Voicing a dog in a movie: $4,000,000

Ferrari: $8,000,000 (Vince is back on top of the world after the critical and financial success of Gatsby)

The Takeover: $9,000,000 (Small raise from Ferrari)

Air-Walker: $12,000,000 (12 was the upfront salary plus back-end. However, we don't know how the movie did, so we'll leave it at that.)

Avion: $15,000,000

Total: $65,570,668.00 (before commission for both E   Ari, and taxes, which are killer in CA)

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Head On: Ari reveals that the movie grossed $18.6 million in its opening weekend. Jessica Alba co-starred with Vince, who was better-known at the time than Vince. We don't know much about the movie, but Fear, which is a similar movie that Mark Wahlberg did when HE was starting out, is a good place to start.

Budget: $10 million Gross:$65 million Reception: 77%

Queens Boulevard: Walsh said that the movie would cost about $5 million to make. Other well-known actors appear in the movie such as Robert Duvall and Zooey Deschanel, increasing awareness of the movie somewhat. However, Billy and Vince blocked the film's national release and E would later mention that not a lot of people saw it. If Vince really was as good as everyone says he was, however, then maybe the movie did gain some money in the DVD market.

Budget: $5 million Gross: $15 million Reception: 82%

Aquaman: James Cameron's movies cost at least $200 million. Went on to become the highest-grossing movie of all-time in the Entourage universe. Not much to explain here.

Budget: $210 million Gross: +$2 billion Reception: 91%

Medellin: Nicky Rubenstein put all of his money into the movie, which was $30 million. We all know how this turkey ended up. Straight-to-DVD.

Budget: $35 million Gross: $2 million Reception: 20%

Skipping Smoke Jumpers because it was never released. Cost: $120 million.

Gatsby: Scorsese's movies usually cost between $90 and $100 million. He also has a really strong track record with film adaptations of novels. This version of the movie probably made the same amount of money that the Leonardo DiCaprio version made, maybe even more. Scorsese is more recognizable and beloved than Luhrmann and setting the movie in modern-day instead of the 1920s might appeal to more people as well. Sloan also mentioned that the movie had gotten pretty good reviews.

Budget: $95 million Gross: $375 million Reception: 88%

Ferrari: Biopic about Enzo Ferrari. The movie Rush, which was also a biopic that is racing-related, would be a good place to start. That movie starred Chris Hemsworth, who also played a superhero like Vince, and Daniel Bruhl, who is a bit less known but whose star is rising. That movie cost about $40 million and earned $90 million at the box office. Vince was back on top of the world around this time, so maybe the movie made more than that. Frank Darabont is also a very acclaimed director.

Budget: $50 million Gross: $130 million Reception: 95%

The Takeover
We don't know too much about this movie, but action movies ain't cheap. Again, Vince was doing pretty well around this time. 

Budget: $70 million Gross: $200 million Reception: 65%

Air-Walker: If you think the Guardians of the Galaxy were obscure, you ain't seen nothing yet. Marvel is arguably the biggest movie studio around today in terms of profit, so many people would see this movie. Vince also has a strong track record in playing superheroes. I think this movie might cost a little bit less than Guardians since Air-Walker is even more obscure than they are.

Budget: $150 million Gross: $650 million Reception: 79%

<TEXT> It was a Marvel comic book movie  Vince was going to do and was first brought up in Season 7. I remember Randall Wallace was the first director for the movie, but he left, so Pete Berg was brought on. Vince was also gonna be paid a TON of money for the movie. However, Vince eventually had to go to rehab since his cocaine addiction started getting the best of him. Contracts with Marvel are usually multi-picture deals so he would've had to appear in other MCU movies, I believe. Did the movie end up happening or was it called off? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Slightly OT, but how come they never had Vince host or cameo on SNL? Or even mention that he did? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-04 05:44:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It seems that every young movie star in Hollywood gets a shot at hosting the show. I'm a little surprised they didn't even mention him doing it. Plus, he's from New York City so it would make even more sense that he does so. The perfect time for him to have done it would've been when Gatsby was coming out since that was his comeback film and it was also set in New York City. Or maybe after Aquaman came out. Vince does have a disdain for television since he doesn't "want to play the same character for five years". He also didn't recognize Bob Saget when he came to his new house and everybody who watches TV regularly knows who he is. Anybody know why? Just a bit curious since I'm a fan of both SNL and Entourage. </TEXT>

<TITLE> What do you think the plot of Queens Boulevard was about? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-02 19:43:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Vince got rave reviews for his performance in the film. However, they never really said what it was about. Here's what we know about it:

* The movie also stars Ethan Suplee, Zooey Deschanel and Robert Duvall. I say Suplee probably played a friend of Vince's character while Deschanel was most likely the love interest. I'd guess that Duvall was the antagonist in the movie. Also the script must've been REALLY good if they got a legendary actor like Robert Duvall to be in it.

* The first shot of the movie is a cop car roaming through an alley in Queens. The last shot of the movie is Vince telling Ethan Suplee's character to put something in the mailbox after he leaves. I'm guessing from these two shots that it's a crime drama.

* Speaking of Drama, he also has a small part in the movie as a bookie. Bookies aren't exactly known as friendly, nice people in movies, so that adds to the possibility that it was a crime drama.

* Vince got the role of Arthur Curry/Aquaman based on what James Cameron saw of QB at Sundance, which wasn't much. For context, Sam Raimi cast Tobey Maguire for Peter Parker/Spider-Man based on his performance in The Cider House Rules. He thought Tobey was perfect for the role because he thought his characters' traits in that movie where what Raimi was looking for in Peter Parker. It could be safe to assume that Cameron cast Vince because he thought Vince's character in QB was what he was looking for in the role of Arthur Curry. Ari said that James Franco and Ryan Gosling also had movies there, so Vince in QB must've been a perfect match for Aquaman.

Of all the movies that Vince did in the show, this one is the one that most intrigues me. Most of his other movies are based on comic books (Aquaman, Air-Walker), books (Gatsby, though setting it in modern-day does sound interesting), historical figures (Medellin, Ferrari) action movies (The Takeover) or are pretty straightforward (Smoke Jumpers is about firefighters). What do you think QB was about?

<TITLE> So is Vince a good actor or not? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-09 06:28:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There are people who say on the show that he is and there are some that say that he isn't:

PRO: 

* Billy Walsh said he is the best young actor of his generation 

*  Martin Scorsese thought he was terrific based on the footage of Smoke Jumpers. James Cameron got him for Aquaman based on what he saw of QB, which wasn't a lot. Darabont also liked him.

* One magazine said he was the next Johnny Depp.


CONS:

* Verner Vollstedt hated him and thought he was talentless. He gave all his lines to Jason Patric and purposely made Vince do a lot of takes for a specific scene.

* Ari himself signed Vince not because he thought he was a good actor but because he thought Vince could be a star.

* Another magazine trashed him after Head On was released.

* He also was nominated for a Razzie for the mess that was Medellin. That one could've been avoided if someone had listened to E, who said the film needed a lot of work before release.

So what do you guys think? That was all I could think of for both sides of the argument. Any that I missed? 

I myself see him more as a Tom Cruise-type or Titanic-era Leonardo DiCaprio  A movie star who is a brand name and

<DATE> 2014-11-13 05:46:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been a big fan of his on the show so far and I think he encapsulates some of the traits that Andy and Fred used to have on the show.

Armisen: He's played many roles that Fred would've played in the past before. I could easily see Fred playing one of the ISIS guys in the Shark Tank from two weeks ago. Kyle also has portrayed Steve Jobs and Pope Francis, both of which Armisen also has played. I also have the feeling that Bruce Chandling would get along really well with Nicholas Fehn. Both usually play weird, offbeat characters on the show.

Samberg: Obviously, both of them are known for the shorts they've made on the show. I think it extends a little beyond that, however. Anyone remember the Lena Dunham teenage girl sketch where Kyle comes in as the captain of the schools' soccer team and plays as the straight man i it? That's a role that Samberg would've played five years ago. Andy hardly got lead roles in sketches, but made the most out of his small, supporting roles, like Kyle has so far.

Are there any current cast members where you see two former cast members in them? I also see Beck Bennett as a combination of Jason Sudeikis and Chris Parnell, but that's another conversation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jim Carrey had three hit comedies in 1994 (The Mask, Ace Ventura, and Dumb and Dumber), two of which had sequels. Ace Ventura made $100 million at the box office, The Mask made over $300 million and Dumb and Dumber made over $200 million . He was also on the hit comedy show In Living Color, even though it was winding down around this time.

Chris Pratt was the lead voice actor in the #1 animated film of the year in The Lego Movie and was also the star of the #1 movie overall this summer in Guardians. He is also part of the ensemble of one of the most critically acclaimed comedies on television in Parks and Rec. He also hosted SNL, something Carrey wouldn't do until 1996 (though he has hosted one other time and is scheduled to do so again sometime this fall.)

Bill Hader did spot-on impressions of Peter Falk and James Mason, while Andy kept doing the same voice for each of Christopher Walken and Julia Roberts. Now they're both big stars (not yet for Hader, at least) and Andys' still inferior to Hader in terms of impressions. It's even higlighted when some of Andys' impressions in the monologue last night weren't so good. What do you guys think? </TEXT>

<TEXT> What do you guys think the Royals should do with him? He's batting .152 (15 for 99). I really do like him, but this is a going all in type of year. Should they platoon him with Valencia? Send him down to Triple-A for a month? I personally think a month of hitting at Triple-A would wonders for his confidence. Danny also would man the hot corner with decent production, which is what the team really needs right now. What do you guys think? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So as it stands right now, Taveras is set to start at AAA to open the season. Adams will be at first with Craig over at right field. Let's say Taveras gets called up around June and as soon as he does, he gets of to a hot start, living up to the hype. But at the same time, Craig is having his typical season of hitting for a high average and a lot of doubles and Matt Adams is just killing it, hitting homer after homer. Let's say 10-15 home runs by June for the big guy. How will Matheny fit in three outstanding players for only two spots? It's a good problem that many teams would like to have, but it is still a problem haha. What would you guys do? </TEXT>

<TEXT> That would be Louis C.K. *Louie* starts back up in May, and the new season of the show has been widely anticipated. I think he was one of the better hosts of last season, when he hosted the post-Sandy hurricane episode. I feel that he really made that episode his own (he was even nominated for an Emmy for his guest-hosting stint). I could see him hosting the penultimate episode, as the finale will probably to go to a veteran of the show (Poehler, Baldwin, Hanks, idk). Plus, many viewers of the show know what he's capable of now and thus, that could help SNL's ratings while also helping *Louie*'s. What do you guys think?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Was watching the James Franco Roast on Youtube and encountered Natasha Legerro's joke to Bill Hader: "You are this generation's Phil Hartman." </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-11-17 07:26:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The joke may have gone a little too far, but I do see similarities between the two SNL legends:

Both were on SNL for eight seasons: Phil from 1986 to 1994, and Bill from 2005 to 2013.

Both actually didn't start out in comedy. Phil was a graphic designer and designed album covers for a lot of bands. Bill was a production assistant for many years on a lot of television shows and movies, some of which were blockbusters.
                                                                                                
 Both have gained a good reputation around the entertainment industry for being strong voice actors. Bill voiced the lead role in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and Phil of course voiced one of the Simpsons most famous recurring characters in Troy McClure.

 Both are/were known to be good people while not on screen.

 Both started out at famed comedy theatres in Los Angeles. Phil was with the Groundlings before SNL and Bill was at Second City Los Angeles.

 Both were never actually thought of as the stars of the show necessarily. They were both backbones to the cast of their times.

 Both were known for their impressions (this one's pretty obvious.)

 Both also had good characters, but Phil never really had a standout one like Bill's Stefon.

 Both of their goodbyes on SNL involved characters. Bill did his in the form of a British punk rocker. Phil wasn't in character, but many members of the SNL cast said goodbye in one of their characters.

 Both never really had lead roles after leaving SNL, with Phil being a supporting actor in movies and in Newsradio, which was more of an ensemble. The jury's still out on Bill though, as he does have a couple of lead roles lined up, such as CWACM's sequel and an indie film, titled     The Skeleton Twins.

 They both had families (this one's stretching it.)

 And finally, both were really talented and can both be considered two of the best SNL cast members of all-time. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Just a general question about cast members returning to host. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-10-09 06:10:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When do you think it is the best time after someone leaves the cast to return as a guest host? I think having Kristen Wiig was a good choice to  host, but her return as one was too soon (not even a year after she left.) Personally, I think two-three years is appropriate enough. I strongly think we'll see Andy Samberg return as host later this year (Brooklyn Nine Nine's off to a strong start) btw. </TEXT>
