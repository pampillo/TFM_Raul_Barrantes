<TEXT> Thank you! My room mate and I ate this kabob-style; it was way too much to eat on my own. It ended up being about medium/medium well, so yeah, not all that photo worthy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It could be that we tend to associate the color gray with cooler colors, so if an image contains lots of grey or black tones as opposed to white, our eyes pick up on the coolness of the image. Blue hues specifically tend to evoke a more somber mood, so it may be that that mood transfers over to a grey-heavy image. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Camel Turkish Royals are the go-to whenever I do smoke, which is pretty occasional. Nice mellow and slightly sweet taste, medium nicotine content, just a solid cig all around. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This ski season (16/17), a small company named Revision Skis released their new line of skis for preorder at the usual date in August, 2016. The expected delivery date for all shipments was to be no later than November. Sometime around December, the company sent out an email that the first batch of skis they received was defective, and that they would send out an update shortly. Here we are in early April and not a single customer has received their skis nor any kind of reimbursement on their order, which is super shitty, given that their skis range from $500-$700. Revision has since lost any shred of respect they once had in the ski community and I can only hope they get slapped with whatever crippling lawsuits come their way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I went to a baptist high school in Indiana for my freshman-junior year. I watched some of the more upstanding kids from my youth group bully the shit out of these two kids at my highschool for no other reason than being skinny and talking kinda strangely. My history teacher taught us that homosexuality was a purely modern phenomenon starting about 100 years ago and that American democracy started going downhill when women got the right to vote. My science teacher taught us that "macro-evolution" was an affront to the Christian faith and actually taught young earth theory as a viable scientific theory. On more than one occasion, my gym teacher berated the weaker kids in class, asking why they couldn't be like the strong athletes and do more than 10 push-ups. Our chapels would mainly consist of fear-mongering stories about hell and secular evils etc. Needless to say, I'm not too keen on the Christian faith anymore. It didn't really fuck me up per say, more just changed my perspective on religion. </TEXT>
