I am going to GSMNP for a birthday hike in a few days and I plan to take a couple of garbage bags with me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I work at a boutique hotel and we have a pretty popular lounge that a lot of locals frequent. I had a man call me today saying he was thinking about proposing to his girlfriend in front of one of her favorite art pieces that we have at the hotel (they had their first date in said lounge). I helped him set up a little 'scavenger hunt' from the lounge to the art piece using our art cards we give to guests when they check in, the last one asking "will you marry me?" I love going out of my way for guests to do things like this. He was nervous about the whole idea but i reassured that the thought was incredibly sweet and she was lucky to spend the rest of her life with him. She said yes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you go to the [NPS website](https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/temproadclose.htm), they have a map of affected areas, and the extent of damage - they also have a list of all closed trails. I am actually going to Gatlinburg area for my birthday (mid February) and did a little research just so I could make the most of the trip after everything that has happened there. From what I read, Gatlinburg is recovering well and a small chunk on the park was affected, near the Chimney Tops trail.

I was so sad I didn't hear from family and only a few friends, so I packed up the pup and went for a day hike, something i knew would make me happy. You may have a handful of friends (assuming, going off personal experience) and that is OKAY. accept, own, and be proud of who you are and make today a celebration for just that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It sounds like you have a persnickety neighbor. It also sounds like you have done everything you can, and then some, to accommodate her 'needs'. You should never feel uncomfortable in your own home. Tell her to fuck off and carry pepper spray for the next time she comes at you with all that screaming nonsense. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Continuous meaning it doesn't have an 'end', like when you reach the top of Mt. Evans or any other access road. Trail Ridge Road is US Highway 34. It does not end when you reach the highest point, it continues on to Granby or Estes Park (depending on your direction). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well I can understand! It is a very unusual spot, indeed. It is unmarked and there is absolutely no area to park your car (observation points are about 1/4 mile in each direction). You would not know this spot were anything special unless you had a RMNP map. I had to stop my car in the middle of the road, and keep an eye out for oncoming traffic, while i took this picture. It was about 80 degrees in Estes Park that day, and a mere 30 degrees at this spot.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> both continuous and contiguous are correct terms. There are access roads higher than this point (approx 12,200 ft), that's why the key word is CONTINUOUS. No other US highway reaches this high of an altitude. </TEXT>
