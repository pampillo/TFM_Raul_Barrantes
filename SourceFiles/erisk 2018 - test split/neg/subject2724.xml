<TITLE> The FCC claims it was hit with a DDoS attack at the exact same time as John Oliver's viral segment on net neutrality </TITLE>

<TEXT> UPDATE: The FCC is [now claiming](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/08/john-oliver-net-neutrality-238132) that it was also hit by a DDoS attack back in 2014, the last time John Oliver did a segment about net neutrality. This makes me even more skeptical. These are serious claims -- they need to show us the proof. The only way we'll know what really happened is if the FCC released their logs to an independent party who can verify their claims.

UPDATE 2: Now we are pretty sure the FCC is lying. Our software dev has confirmed that the FCC's site [went down again](http://imgur.com/a/cALQp) last night around 8:30pm EST, shortly after the John Oliver segment would have aired again on HBO. He also confirmed that their servers repeatedly fell down under net neutrality comments coming through [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com) over the last two weeks. It seems extremely likely the FCC is attempting to cover up the fact that their comment system simply cannot handle large amounts of feedback from the public. 

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC)  just issued a [press release](https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-344764A1.pdf) claiming, Beginning on Sunday night at midnight, our analysis reveals that the FCC was subject to multiple distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS). 

The FCC is saying that the site hosting their comment system was attacked *at the exact same time* comments would have started flooding in from John Olivers viral Last Week Tonight [segment about net neutrality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92vuuZt7wak). The media [widely reported](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/05/john-oliver-tackles-net-neutrality-again-crashes-fcc-comments-site-again/) that the surge in comments crashed the FCCs site. 

Disclosure: I am a a net neutrality activist and I work for [Fight for the Future](https://www.fightforthefuture.org) one of the groups behind [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com). I have been paying close attention to the issue since 2014, and have been part of efforts that [overwhelmed](http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-fcc-website-net-neutrality-20140715-story.html) the FCCs comment site in the past. 

The FCCs statement today raises two concerns for me. It strikes me that either:

1. The FCC is being intentionally misleading, and trying to claim that the surge in traffic from large numbers of people attempting to access their site through John Olivers GoFCCYourself.com redirect amounts to a DDoS attack, to let themselves off the hook for essentially silencing large numbers of people by not having a properly functioning site to receive comments from the public about an important issue, orworst caseis preparing a bogus legal argument that somehow John Olivers show *itself* was the DDoS attack.

2. Someone actually did DDoS the FCCs site at the exact same time as John Olivers segment, in order to actively prevent people from being able to comment in support of keeping the Title II net neutrality rules  many of us fought for in 2015.

Given the current FCC chairman Ajit Pais [open hostility](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/26/trump-overturn-net-neutrality-rules-resistance) toward net neutrality, and the telecom industrys [long history](https://news.vice.com/article/cable-companies-are-astroturfing-fake-consumer-support-to-end-net-neutrality) of astroturfing and paying [shady organizations](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/shady-conservative-group-is-flooding-the-fcc-with-anti-net-neutrality-comments) to influence the FCC, either of these scenarios should be concerning for anyone who cares about government transparency, free speech, and the future of the Internet. 

One thing that we can do right now is call for the FCC to release its logs to independent security analysts so that we know what actually happened. The public has a right to know. You can email the FCCs Chief Information Officer asking for them to do this at David.Bray@fcc.gov or call 202-418-2020

<TEXT> Hey everyone! Evan here from Fight for the Future, the group who put up these billboards (with your help!) Just wanted to let folks know that given the huge response, and some new donations that came in, we're already planning to put up two more billboards targeting Rep Darell Issa (who likes to pretend he's a pro-internet guy) and Rep Leonard Lance. If you want more boards, we can make it happen! The crowdfunding page [is here.](https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/campaigns/you-betrayed-us-billboards/#page-1) If one of your representatives voted for SJ Res 34 and you want to see a billboard targeting them, we could possibly help you with the logistics of it, so get in touch :-) </TEXT>

<TEXT> That seems a little dismissive of people who live in rural / conservative areas. Polling shows that voters from across the political spectrum overwhelmingly opposed this move. Hopefully these billboards will help expose these lawmakers' corruption to their constituents.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure. So the money we're talking about here comes in as campaign contributions. Companies are able to give large donations to members of Congress to support their campaigning efforts. THEORETICALLY that is not supposed to influence how lawmakers vote, and they are not supposed to do "tit for tat" stuff ie "you support my campaign, I'll vote on the thing you want," but of course that's how it ends up going down. https://www.opensecrets.org/ is a great resource for checking which companies / industries members of congress are taking large donations from, and how much those industries are spending on lobbying.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Spotted driving around the FCC this morning </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-21 02:55:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This morning, this mobile billboard [was spotted](https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/855144442898132992) driving around the Federal Communication Commission (FCC)s headquarters in Washington, DC, while the agency held its monthly open meeting.

The billboard was paid for by American Commitment, the shadowy anti-net-neutrality astroturf group with [ties](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/net-neutrality-is-marxist-according-to-this-koch-backed-astroturf-group) to the Koch Brothers that was [caught](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/net-neutrality-email-american-commitment-116553) red handed in 2016 flooding the FCC with fake comments against net neutrality, and comments essentially [purchased](https://www.techdirt.com/blog/netneutrality/articles/20150401/07000630513/massive-anti-net-neutrality-e-mail-campaign-shows-signs-identity-fraud.shtml) through a network of misleading petitions and ad buys. 

The message on the billboard is pure falsehood. [Millions of people](http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/16/6257887/fcc-net-neutrality-3-7-million-comments-made) from across the political spectrum spoke out in support of net neutrality, not just tech socialists (whatever that means.) In fact, thousands of startups, entrepreneurs, and most prominent venture capitalists [supported](https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/tech-investors-venture-capitalist-fcc-net-neutrality/) Title II based net neutrality rules. 

This is just the latest episode in a [long history](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/cables-companies-are-astroturfing-fake-consumer-support-to-end-net-neutrality) of the telecom industry using astroturf lobbying groups to create the appearance of grassroots opposition to basic open Internet protections like net neutrality, which prevents ISPs like Comcast, Verizon, and AT T from discriminating between different websites, throttling, or censoring online content.

If you want to make sure that decision-makers hear from real people about why the free and open Internet matters to them, you can find a Congressional town hall near you using [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com), or use [this site](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/dont-mess-up-the-net-with-partisan-politics) to contact your lawmakers and the FCC. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think either is fine -- it's best to memorize what you are going to say but it's fine to have paper to refer to. The most important thing is to know your facts and have a question prepared that doesn't give the member of Congress any wiggle room. For example, instead of saying "Do you support net neutrality" (which lets them say "Well yes but not this current form" you can say "Last year, millions of people spoke out and the FCC enacted some of the strongest net neutrality protections in the world, using Title II authority to prevent companies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT T from throttling, blocking, or otherwise censoring the websites we visit. The new chairman of the FCC has said he plans to repeal these rules that the public overwhelmingly support. What do you plan to do as our representative to stop him?" </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks! And yes, this is absolutely right on. The fundamental problem here is that Team Cable, the big ISPs including AT T, Verizon, Comcast, etc. have chosen to leverage their political and lobbying power to push toward near-monopoly status, rather than innovating or providing better services to consumers. That means that many people living in the US have basically no choice between providers for high speed Internet. That lack of competition allows these companies to abuse their role as gatekeepers, squeeze customers for more money, throttle our connections with arbitrary data caps, etc. The first thing we need to do is organize to stop them from dismantling the strong net neutrality protections that are preventing them from doing even more "Cable company fuckery" (as John Oliver put it.) But in the long run we also need to push to remove legal barriers to municipal broadband and and make it easier for people to start small, local ISPs. It's notable that a bunch of small ISPs spoke out last month when the big ones lobbied to strike down the FCC's Internet privacy rules. We need more of that!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It won't be easy if we have anything to do with it! But the net neutrality protections that we won are at the FCC, which is an independent agency, so the new administration does have a fair amount of power to change the rules or refuse to enforce them. That's why it's super critical that we generate a massive public response right now -- so the new FCC, and Congress, know that they can't come and try to take away these rules without a huge fight. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reminding lawmakers that net neutrality is a free speech issue is also important. Throttling websites is a form of censorship. Without net neutrality protections there is nothing to stop a company like Comcast (who owns MSNBC) from slowing down websites like Breitbart or Newsmax while speeding up the New York Times and Huffington Post. This of course cuts the other way as well. The bottom line is that the companies that connect us to the Internet should get to control what we can see and do once we get there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey reddit,

The FCC just held a closed door meeting with lobbyists from the Cable industry, and now the Wall Street Journal and others [are reporting](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/u-fcc-chairman-plans-fast-024351516.html) that the new chairman is moving fast to dismantle  the Open Internet order / net neutrality protections that we won last year. If this happens, it would open the flood gates for a tiered internet with fast lanes and slow lanes, throttling, and censorship. 

This news does not come as a surprise, but its coming faster than we thought. So now is the time to mobilize. Members of Congress are in their home districts this week and next, which makes this a particularly critical moment for us to make our voices heard. 

**Heres what you can do:**

**1. [Find a Congressional Town Hall Meeting near you](https://actionnetwork.org/forms/urgent-theyre-coming-for-net-neutrality-sooner-than-we-thought)** and show up to ask a question or hold a sign in support of net neutrality.

**2. [Request a meeting with your member of Congress](https://actionnetwork.org/forms/request-a-meeting-with-your-lawmakers-to-defend-net-neutrality)** while they are in district over the next two weeks.

**3. [Sign this petition](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/dont-mess-up-the-net-with-partisan-politics)** telling Congress that net neutrality is not a partisan issue.

We need to make sure that there is someone asking a question about net neutrality at every single Congressional town hall meeting taking place over the next two weeks. This is a task that redditors are perhaps uniquely positioned to accomplish. In addition to asking questions, we encourage redditors to use the comments section or create threads to organize meet-ups or support each other in attending events and speaking to members of Congress about why net neutrality is important to them. Search for town hall meetings near you [here.](https://actionnetwork.org/forms/urgent-theyre-coming-for-net-neutrality-sooner-than-we-thought)

We represent just a handful of the massive coalition of organizations, startups, tech experts, and individuals that banded together to fight for the net neutrality protections that we have in place now. Some of us helped launch the Battle for the Net campaign, which was part of the effort that helped drive nearly 4 million comments to the FCC. Ask us anything!!!

<TEXT> The FCC [just held](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-internet-idUSKBN1790AP) a closed door meeting with lobbyists from the telecom Industry, and now theyre [moving fast](http://mashable.com/2017/04/07/internet-ready-for-a-fight-over-net-neutrality/) to undermine the Open Internet order / net neutrality protections that we won last year and open the flood gates for fast lanes and slow lanes, throttling, and censorship.

Members of Congress are in their home districts this week, and many are hosting town hall meetings where constituents can ask questions and speak directly to their Senators and Representatives. 

Speaking up for net neutrality at one of these events is perhaps the single most effective thing you can do right now to fight back against Comcast, Verizon, and AT Ts attack on the basic net neutrality protections that keep the Internet awesome.

You can find a crowdsourced list of Congressional town hall meetings happening this week and see if there is one near you [here.](http://www.townhallproject.com)

If you cant attend one of these events, you can use [this Fight for the Future page](https://actionnetwork.org/forms/request-a-meeting-with-your-lawmakers-to-defend-net-neutrality) to request a meeting with your lawmaker.

If youre able to attend one of these town hall meetings, here are some tips:

1. Do a little research. Each meeting is different, so click the link for more info to find out what time to arrive, and whether you need to register ahead of time in order to ask a question.

2. Dress nice and be polite. Lots of us are angry right now, but we need to convince these representatives that their constituents really care about this issue. Make your point firmly, and with conviction, but carry yourself with respect.

3. Bring a friend. Bring a friend or two, or more, who can show their support by applauding after you ask your question, or holding signs outside. Have one of them take a video of your question and the representatives response, and post it or send it to us.

4. Be prepared. Prepare a short question thats backed up by facts, and identify yourself as a constituent. Heres an example:

*Hi, Im [NAME]. Im a constituent and I work as a teacher here in [CITY]. The Federal Communications Commission has been meeting behind closed doors with lobbyists from big cable companies, and say that they are planning to repeal net neutrality protections that prevent companies like Comcast and Verizon from scamming consumers, and blocking, throttling, or otherwise censoring the websites we visit. Net neutrality is an essential protection for freedom of speech. Id like to know what [LAWMAKER NAME] plans to do to defend Title II net neutrality, which protects our right to a free and open Internet.*

Talk to any Congressional staffer and they will tell you how big of an impact it has when people actually show up at these town hall meetings and speak directly to their representatives. We need to make sure there is someone asking a question about net neutrality at every town hall meeting that happens over the next two weeks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Loving all the comments here! Showing up at these town hall meetings in groups is even more effective than showing up alone. It would be awesome if redditors started using this thread to organize meet-ups at these town hall events or drop-ins to their lawmakers' offices. Even if you can't get on the schedule, you can still stand outside with signs, talk to the media, deliver letters to your lawmakers' office, and get all your friends to call them. The bottom line is we need every member of Congress to feel like they are constantly hearing about net neutrality from real constituents. That's how we beat the lobbying power of Comcast, Verizon, AT T et al. Let's do it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I couldn't find any public statements, but he voted for several bills to undermine the FCC's authority to enforce net neutrality protections, so I would assume he is somewhat hostile. I would remind him that more than 4 million Americans from across the political spectrum spoke up to support the current FCC rules that we have in place -- which prevent Cable companies from censoring websites and creating fast lanes and slow lanes on the Internet. Since he's a Republican, he may be swayed by some of the conservative arguments linked below. Good luck!

<TEXT> Hey reddit,

So as you probably already know, last week Congress [voted](http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/29/technology/internet-privacy-outrage/) to gut Internet privacy rules and allow Internet Service Providers like Comcast, Verizon, and AT T to monitor, collect, and sell your online browsing habits to advertisers. Without the rules, ISPs can do all kinds of other [creepy stuff](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/five-ways-cybersecurity-will-suffer-if-congress-repeals-fcc-privacy-rules) too like track your real-time location, install malware on your phone to record what youre doing in real time, and inject ads directly into your web browsing.

The Senate and House already voted for the bill, and President Trump [signed](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-internet-privacy-fcc-20170404-story.html) it last night. 

The vote generated a lot of public outcry, but one thing thats interesting about it is that people from all across the political spectrum are outraged. Progressive groups [condemned](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2017/3/23/1646500/-Republican-senators-vote-to-repeal-all-of-our-broadband-privacy-rights) the move, but a ton of Trumps top supporters in r/TheDonald were [also](https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/reddit-the-donald-internet-privacy-crisis/) up in arms about this.

So, heres my idea: what if redditors from radically different ends of the political spectrum meet up and take a photo together with a sign showing that they both agree that Trump should veto SJ Res 34. Im imagining someone in a #MAGA hat and someone in a Bernie t-shirt standing together holding a sign that says We both agree: ISPs shouldnt be able to sell our online habits without our permission. No more attacks on our Internet freedom.

Even just one photo like this would be great, but if a bunch of us started posting them I bet we could make a big news story out of it.

If you remember SOPA, that was a bill that EVERYONE expected would pass too. Its too late to stop this legislation now, but if we can cause a huge stir over this, it will make a big difference with the fights for our Internet freedom and privacy ahead.

If you email me your photo: evangreer@gmail.com, the nonprofit I work for, Fight for the Future, will help make sure it gets spread around. Thanks reddit! Lets do this! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The House of Representatives will [vote today](https://www.savebroadbandprivacy.org) on a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to gut the FCCs broadband privacy rules that prevent Internet Service Providers like Comcast, AT T, and Verizon from selling your personal information  -- like browsing history and real-time location -- to advertisers without your consent.

The rules that could be repealed also [prevent](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/five-ways-cybersecurity-will-suffer-if-congress-repeals-fcc-privacy-rules) ISPs from injecting ads into your web browsing, installing undetectable software on your devices to track your activity, and deploying systems to undermine encryption. When ISPs collect and store this information, they will also be making it available to the Federal government and law enforcement through bulk surveillance programs. 

The measure passed the Senate last week, and it was a strict party line vote with 50 members of the GOP voting to gut the rules. Given that many members of the House Freedom Caucus have taken strong previous stands for Americans right to privacy, its very important that we make sure they know that voters from across the spectrum want them to oppose this attack on our basic rights. Below are the names, phone numbers, and twitter handles. Please contact them now. The vote could come within hours.

Heres a sample script of what you can say if you call:

<TEXT> On Thursday, March 23rd, Congress [will vote](https://consumerist.com/2017/03/08/senators-officially-introduce-resolution-to-reverse-isp-privacy-rule/) on whether to use a special legislative mechanism called the Congressional Review Act (CRA)  to roll back the FCCs landmark broadband privacy rules for Internet Service Providers (like AT T, Comcast, and Verizon) that many of us fought hard for last year.. The 22 senators behind this controversial resolution have [received](http://www.vocativ.com/411479/senators-online-privacy-money/) more than $1.6 million from the very same companies that would profit from this. 

If these privacy protections are removed, ISPs will be able to [do the following](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/five-creepy-things-your-isp-could-do-if-congress-repeals-fccs-privacy-protections): 

* Monitor and sell all your location data, search history, app usage, and browsing habits to advertisers without your permission
* Hijack your search results, redirecting your traffic to paying third parties
* Insert ads into web pages that would otherwise not have them

Read the full text of the resolution [here](https://consumermediallc.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/03072017-flake-cra.pdf).

This is going to be a close vote. Below are the names, numbers, and twitter handles of  key members of Congress who could vote to uphold current broadband privacy rules. 

If you want to call them now to ask them to protect our privacy, heres a sample script you could use: 

Hi, my name is ____ , Im calling to ask Senator ____ to vote against the CRA proposal to roll back the FCCs broadband privacy rules. Please dont let Internet Service Providers sell my personal information without my permission.

You can also tweet at your representatives, something like:

Dear @RepTwitterHandle please protect #BroadbandPrivacy. Dont let ISPs sell my personal information.

<TEXT> The site actually strongly encourages you to NOT memorize a ton of passwords, and instead to use one really strong password for your phone, one really strong password for your computer, and then a password manager for all the rest. Locking yourself out of your phone is annoying, but if you're backing it up regularly it's not a catastrophe. Getting your phone hacked and your photos leaked or credit card info stolen is a much bigger headache. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wrote this, and figured i'd pull out the section I think is maybe the most important:

But the groundwork for this cruelty was laid long before Trump was even a candidate. As a young queer person, it often seemed like the organizations that were supposed to advocate for me were primarily interested in getting me married and into the military as quickly as possible. Mainstream gay and lesbian rights organizations, though they were slowly adding a B, T, and Q to their mission statements, spent millions of dollars lobbying for marriage equality and repealing Dont Ask Dont Tell, while largely ignoring the struggles of anyone who was not the white, gay, cisgender men that made up their donor base.

With assimilation, rather than liberation, as their driving principle, these organizations systematically excluded the voices of transgender youth, people of color, working class gays, queers in prison, and sex workers, while advancing an agenda that did little to confront the extreme forms of discrimination and violence that the most oppressed members of our community continue to face today. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This part really got me:

"When the prison tried to break one of us, we all stood up. We looked out for each other. When they tried to divide us, and systematically discriminated against us, we embraced our diversity and pushed back. But, I also learned from all of you when to pick my battles. I grew up and grew connected because of the community you provided.

Those outside of prison may not believe that we act like human beings under these conditions. But of course we do. And we build our own networks of survival." </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem is that trans women have been historically excluded from women's spaces -- a reality that contributes to violence against the trans community. Trans women face disproportionate levels of violence and discrimination. The organizers did a great job with so many things, but given the long history of exclusion, putting a trans person on stage early in the program would have helped a lot to set the tone, and having more trans voices would do a lot to heal the rift that isn't helping our movement. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Before you jump in with some mean-spirited comment about Chelsea's gender or suggest she should die, please remember that she is a human being. She has friends, family, and people who care about her. Regardless how you feel about the documents she released or the charges she faced, we can all agree that the treatment she has endured is inhumane. No one should have to go what she has gone through. When we excuse torture or degrading treatment just because we don't like (or don't understand) the person who is being subjected to it, we undermine all of our basic human rights, and encourage governments to use their power unchecked. Please, think critically before you condemn Chelsea, or anyone else. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Here's the stupidest thing yet that a politician has said about the mass DDoS attacks that took down "the internet" </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-22 21:54:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ever since the mass DDoS attacks yesterday that took down "the Internet," I've been trying to keep track of all the blatantly incorrect, misleading, fear mongering statements that members of Congress and other officials have made. (Disclosure: I work for [a nonprofit](fightforthefuture.org) that fights bad Internet legislation like CISA.)

It's been tough to choose, but there's one that stands out as the most ridiculous:

Tennessee's Representative Marsha Blackburn [went on CNN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-yJbac48m4 feature=youtu.be) shortly after the attacks and implied that the Internet outage could have been prevented by a bill called SOPA, the Stop Online Piracy Act, which you may remember because it was resoundingly rejected after [mass protests](https://www.sopastrike.com/numbers/) as TERRIBLE idea that would have lead to widespread internet censorship. It also had absolutely *nothing* to do with preventing cyber attacks. Even its proponents would agree that it was about copyright enforcement, not digital security. It certainly did nothing to hold companies accountable for improving the security of consumer technology products, which is what [actually would](http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/10/double-dip-internet-of-things-botnet-attack-felt-across-the-internet/) prevent attacks like this.

Blackburn went on to blame free speech advocates for having stopped SOPA, and even went so far as to call us ... wait for it ... CYBERBOTS!!!

Do you care about free speech? If so, you're a cyberbot too. Cyberbots unite! Let's remember that many politicians barely understand how the Internet works. We can't let them exploit these recent attacks to push for bad legislation. [More here.](https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/789590696806248448) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey... Evan Greer here. I'd be more than happy to talk you through the specifics of how the TPP hurts all of us. Give me a buzz? evangreer@gmail.com

A basic summary:
-It's more than 5,000 pages long, most of those pages have nothing to do with trade
-The Investor State Dispute Settlement section provides multinational corporations with a way to undermine basic democratic process, fining governments for basic things like labor standards, environmental protections, etc.
-It exports the U.S.'s broken copyright system to other countries, expanding Internet censorship, without required protections for Fair Use / free speech
-It jacks up the cost of generic medicine, disproportionately affecting LGBTQ people and poor people
-It harshens penalties for Whistleblowers and journalists reporting on corporate abuse in its "trade secrets" section
-It undermines labor standards globally, making it easier for companies to send jobs to wherever wages are lowest

There's so may other things. All of this is easily sourced with a google search. hit me up with questions, for real.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Re-pasting this from below to save myself from carpal tunnel. All of the experts here have been posting tons of specifics about what is in the actual text. You zeroing in on my very real concern about how the non-transparent process is what LEAD to these very specific problems as if that invalidates our real concerns just... makes no sense.

1) The TPP would export the worst parts of the U.S.'s broken copyright system to other countries, without expanding protections for free speech/fair use. This will lead to even more legitimate content being censored and taken down from the Internet, and have a chilling effect on innovation, creativity, and free speech. More from EFF here: http://eff.org/issues/tpp
2) The TPP's section on Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) would grant corporations extraordinary powers to sue governments in tribunals in front of a panel of three corporate lawyers, many of whom rotate between "judging" these cases and being the ones doing the suing, in order to strike down democratically passed laws that might harm a company's "expected future profits." This shocking system essentially gives multinational corporations an end-run around our democratic process, allowing them to undermine or strike down basic protections for environmental standards, workers rights, public health, etc. More from Public Citizen: http://www.citizen.org/documents/ustr-isds-response.pdf
3) The TPP would grant pharmaceutical corporations new monopoly rights to prevent them from having to compete with more affordable generic medicines, raising the cost of medicine for everyone, and disproportionately impacting people in poorer countries. More from Doctors without Borders: http://www.msfaccess.org/spotlight-on/trans-pacific-partnership-agreement
I'll let others chime in with more here -- but you can easily research all of this stuff. Our issues are not with just the process, but the fact that the process inevitably leads to these types of abuses. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a good question. The reality is that the TPP would not help those Vietnamese kids either. These types of agreements lead to a "race to the bottom" and make it so that governments have no incentive to improve working standards in their countries. Companies will always just send jobs to wherever it's cheapest for them, and then cut and run as soon as they find someplace better for their profits. The history of these deals clearly shows that they don't improve standards anywhere in the longterm -- they just shuffle the oppression around a bit in the short term but don't improve anyone's situation in the end. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was a professional musician for 10 years before coming to Fight for the Future, and I supported my family (including a small kid) doing it. There is definitely an important debate to be had about what the right way is to make the Internet work for all creators. In fact, it may be the most important conversation / question of our generation impacting the future of creativity and freedom of expression. That's exactly why the TPP is an absolutely terrible place for policy impacting intellectual property to happen. We need to have an open conversation about this that includes artists, Internet users, and creators of all kinds. Right now our copyright system is extremely unbalanced and privileges the rights of large corporations over supporting individual artists and creators, and it's frequently abused to censor and take down legitimate content from the Internet, which has a profound effect on free expression and our ability to share, create, and learn on the internet. The TPP would lock us into that broken system and export it to other countries, at a time when we should be figuring out how to fix it and make it work for all creators, not just giant corporate ones. </TEXT>

Big companies have the ear of government officials and convince them that giving them these special handouts will lead to more jobs, more economic prosperity, all the stuff that people (and voters) like. But those promises never come true. The TPP would give corporations EVEN MORE power over our government. That's the last thing we need. </TEXT>

Maybe not all of them will walk away and get involved in the fight, but a bunch will, and that's a huge boost to our movement. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great question -- I love talking about organizing and how it works. So beyond the online promotion, we have a coalition on the ground in every city spreading the word through all kinds of channels from putting up posters to making announcements at activist meetings and other concerts. We have unions putting up flyers in their work places, and people phone banking to spread the word. This is a totally grassroots effort and it's amazing to see so many different people and groups coming together to make it happen.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure. I actually have a six year old, and this is how I explained it to her: The TPP is global deal that was worked out in secret. So basically a bunch of corporate lobbyists and government officials sat in secret meetings, where no one could see what they were doing, and wrote rules that are going to affect all of us, without our input. The rules affect everything from jobs and wages to what we can do on the Internet to environmental standards to how much medicine costs. They wrote all the rules in secret and now they've released them, but before they can go into effect and become law, Congress has to approve it. The goal of the Rock Against the TPP tour is to raise awareness so that enough people know what's happening to make sure that Congress never does that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think we should ever just trust any politicians to do the right thing. The reality is that there are so many forces at play: lobbying dollars, campaign contributions, etc. We always need to pay attention and push hard with grassroots pressure to hold our elected officials accountable. Corporate lobbyists keep their staffers on speed-dial, we need to make sure they know that we're paying just as close attention. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The TPP is backed by the Obama administration, the Chamber of Commerce, Google, Facebook, the banking industry, the pharmaceutical industry, and basically every large corporation in the world. It's definitely controversial, and there's been a lot of talk in Congress that makes it seem like it's on the ropes -- that's good news. it means we have a CHANCE of defeating it. But if no one speaks out, this thing will almost definitely become law. That's why we're organizing Rock Against the TPP: we need to do more than just petitions and phone calls, we need to make this deal 100% politically toxic, and make sure they can't ram it through during the lame duck session this Fall. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the TPP is a perfect example of how the traditional Left/Right divide in politics is kind of failing us. It's pretty awesome to see people from across the political spectrum coming out of the woodwork to oppose the TPP. The artists we have on the tour come from a variety of perspectives, they don't all agree on everything, but they all agree that the TPP is a disaster for our democracy. That's the bottom line here: we need to stop the TPP but we also need to do away with the corrupt thinking that brought it to us. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a great question. "Free trade" definitely sounds like a great idea. But the reality is that these types of non-transparent trade agreements are anything but free trade. Instead, they allow the largest, incumbent corporations to essentially buy a seat at the table and then set policy that benefits them while undermining the ability of smaller businesses, new startups, and innovative new services to compete. So it's not free trade at all, it's actually an extreme form of government-corporate regulation that runs counter to the concepts of a free market  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are so many reasons to choose from, but for me the #1 problem is that the completely non-transparent process surrounding these types of "trade" deals make them a perfect venue for corporations to push for policies that they know they could never get passed if they did them out in the open through traditional legislative means. The extreme secrecy surrounding the negotiations, and the fact that hundreds of corporate advisors get to sit in closed-door meetings with government officials while the public, journalists, and experts are locked out inevitably results in a deal that is super unbalanced and favors the rights of giant corporations over the rights of average people, small businesses, start-ups, etc. So, while there's a laundry list of problems with the TPP text itself, from the ways that it would enable more online censorship to the serious issues surrounding job loss and medicine access, for me the biggest issue is with the whole process itself: this is just an unacceptable way to be making policy in the modern age. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah I think this definitely happens a lot. In my personal experience I've also been misgendered a lot by journalists who were not doing it intentionally, and who were super apologetic when I brought it to their attention. They just made assumptions based on my name or my voice on the phone. The good thing is the problem is super easy to fix, if news organizations institute the policy the petition is calling for, and just confirm source's pronouns the same way they'd confirm the spelling of your name or your job title. That won't stop malicious outlets from misgendering people on purpose, but it will stop a huge amount of unintentional misgendering from journalists who are just not educated enough on trans issues. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First of all, Chelsea is a woman, so please refer to her as "she." Second of all, the idea that people are only sent to solitary confinement for being violent is patently false. Even the Obama administration recently called for states to curtail the over-use of solitary confinement. The use of solitary confinement to arbitrarily punish LGBTQ prisoners is well documented. 

Finally, even the U.S. government agrees that transgender prisoners should receive healthcare related to their gender transitions, because DOCTORS agree that these treatments are not elective but in fact medically and psychologically necessary. The fact that you seem gleeful that people are dying in prison from other forms of neglect doesn't diminish this point.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Disclosure: I work with Fight for the Future, a group that supports Chelsea, and I talk to her on the phone roughly once a week.

Chelsea is not currently in solitary confinement. This piece is reflecting on her experiences earlier on in her incarceration. She's currently held in the Military Correctional Facility in Ft Leavenworth, KS. She does not feel in physical danger from other prisoners -- although the U.S. government continues to deny her basic healthcare related to her gender transition, and refuses to allow her to grow her hair past the Military's designated "male," length. 

Many many trans people are placed in solitary confinement as a form of punishment, although it is almost always framed as if it is "for their own protection." What Chelsea's article highlights is that solitary is a form of torture -- so it's not a humane alternative to general population for transgender prisoners, it's often even worse.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi there, Evan here from Fight for the Future. We launched the petition that's linked above. We're fans of coinbase and we've worked with you all previously on Bitcoin Black Friday, if you recall. I'm a bit surprised to learn that you've never heard of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It's one of the highest profile political fights of the year, and has serious implications for startups, Internet freedom, privacy, free speech, etc. We'd love to chat with you about it and share some information! I also agree with the others here that, if Coinbase doesn't share the Internet Association's position on the TPP, it would be really helpful for you to clarify that, like reddit did, either in a blog post, on twitter, or in some other public manner. Feel free to reach out to me directly if you'd like to chat: evan@fightforthefuture.org </TEXT>

<TEXT> Basically the way it works now, the government can get what's called an Administrative Subpoena, which is way easier to get than a warrant and doesn't require probable cause, and use that to force a company (like Google or... reddit) to hand over emails or other data that are either "unopened" or "abandoned" ie being left on a server, for more than 180 days. If this bill passes the Senate, companies would no longer have to comply with administrative subpoenas for content in most cases, instead the government would have to get a actual warrant to get your emails, even ones that are 180 days old. That said, there are still a ton of other ways that the government can (and does) spy on your email, texts, location, and other data, especially if you are not a U.S. citizen, or communicate with anyone who is not a U.S. citizen. So, this bill is a good thing, a step in the right direction, but we still have a long way to go to restore our basic constitutional (and human) right to privacy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First of all, Evan happens to be a gender neutral name that is used by cis-women, but misgendering happens to people with all kinds of names, it can happen because of how someone interprets your voice or your appearance as well, or for people with neutral names communicating only by text, implicit bias often leads reporters to assume they are male. But again, the great thing is that this is a super easy fix: if reporters simply confirm a source's gender pronouns the same way they'd confirm the spelling of their name or their job title, the problem is solved. Wha's so threatening about that idea? </TEXT>

<TITLE> The DOJ is probably lying about its latest claim in the Apple vs FBI case (proof) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-23 19:39:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Several outlets are [reporting](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-encryption-cellebrite-idUSKCN0WP17J) that the 3rd party who supposedly just approached the FBI offering to help hack the iPhone at the center of the Apple vs FBI case is Israeli security firm Cellebrite. 

The DOJ publicly claimed at least [19 times](https://www.emptywheel.net/2016/03/22/dojs-pre-ass-handing-capitulation/) that there was no other viable method to open Sayed Farooks iPhone other than with Apples help. This was a core tenet of their case using the All Writs Act.

But surveillance blogger Marcy Wheeler points out that the DOJ was [already in talks](https://www.emptywheel.net/2016/03/23/on-february-16-doj-got-a-warrant-to-open-an-iphone-6-using-cellebrite/) with Cellebrite about hacking an iPhone 6 in a drug case as long ago as February 16th. Cellebrite is a well-known firm used by many law enforcement agencies, and it publicly [boasts](http://www.timesofisrael.com/how-israels-cellebrite-could-unlock-the-san-bernadino-iphone/) on its website about its ability to hack Apple products. 

The DOJ never mentioned Cellebrite as an alternative possibility in its filings with the court. In this case, that omission essentially amounts to lying. They consistently claimed that there was simply no other way to break into the phone without Apples help, even though they knew there was another very plausible possibility. 

Even before this latest announcement, multiple expert security researchers have cast serious doubt on the DOJs claim that only Apple could help unlock the phone. See [this](https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-future/one-fbis-major-claims-iphone-case-fraudulent), [this](http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/02/how-the-fbi-could-use-acid-and-lasers-to-access-data-stored-on-seized-iphone/), and [this](https://theintercept.com/2016/03/08/snowden-fbi-claim-that-only-apple-can-unlock-phone-is-bullshit/). 

This seems really worth digging into. It really looks like the FBI is backing down from this fight because they realized they were losing public trust and werent going get the precedent they were after. Its important that the public understand what really happened here.

The FBI should come clean immediately, and admit that they mislead the court and the public, to avoid further damaging whats left of their credibility. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Disclosure: I wrote this :-)

It's definitely an issue of privacy, and of security in general. But the point of this piece is that privacy issues affect different people differently. The potential ramifications for some people of having their privacy violated are much greater than others. So, while this is a case that impacts all of us, it's one that people who care about marginalized communities should be particularly focused on, since it will disproportionately affect those communities.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem is that the technology is being consistently misrepresented. They're not asking Apple to "unlock" a phone. They're asking them to write software that would weaken the security of millions of phones, and in the process set a precedent that the government can force private companies to weaken the security of their products. Engineers who use iPhones protect the security of our hospitals, water treatment facilities, airports, power plants, etc.

So, unfortunately, Apple can't just "open that one phone." If they help the FBI in the way they've requested, they'll instead be opening a Pandora's box that makes all of us less safe. </TEXT>

Your question about which arguments are most convincing is really good and one we all need to consider. There are so many things wrong with the TPP that it provides a good opportunity to figure out which of those things the lawmaker you're contacting is likely to care most about and highlight it.

I think there are more resources out there on the left hand side of things, so here are some resources for why GOP should oppose the TPP (note I don't agree particularly with all of these framings personally, but I think they are helpful depending on our audience):

<TEXT> Personally I think there are better uses for dildos. (!!!)

But the people here who have the power to stop this are U.S. congress. That's the theory of change for how we can still stop this deal. It's deeply controversial in Congress and faces opposition from both left and right. We need to get really creative and organized and put concerted pressure on lawmakers to make sure they oppose this deal when it comes to a vote.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not totally sure what you're referring to. There have been a number of major moments around the TPP in the past, including the fight over Fast Track legislation here in the U.S., but there hasn't been a vote in Congress on the agreement yet. That's our moment to stop it. Now's the time to be [contacting your lawmakers](https://www.fightthetpp.org) and demanding they vote no on the TPP. The vote could come anytime in the next several months.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We are planning a major "TPP Roadshow" in 12 strategic cities that will bring together high profile performers, musicians, speakers, celebrities, etc. to help spark large educational events but also targeted actions. I think there is a huge need for escalated action on the TPP -- the way to win this is in Congress, so people in local communities organizing creative protests and civil disobedience focused on their Senators and Representatives would be a very good thing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also, to answer the second part of your question -- the TPP will be the largest agreement of its kind in history. If it fails -- and Senator Wyden could have played a major role in helping stop it if he hadn't chosen to champion it instead -- it will be a long, long time before governments attempt something like this again. Any lawmaker claiming to support the TPP because it's the "best we're going to get" is just trying to save face while they support an agreement that's incredibly popular with large, incumbent, corporations, but harmful for everyone else. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Full disclosure, I once [flew a 30' blimp](https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/wydenblimp/) over all of Senator Wyden's town hall meetings for a week protesting his position on TPP. 

I think unfortunately, in this case, Wyden's excuses are a bit vapid. He is the Senator of a state that has a big export economy, and some of the largest companies there, like Nike, are very keen on getting the TPP passed. Wyden is a bit of an ideological supporter of so-called "free trade" (there's lots of writing out there about how these to-down, secretive, and bureaucratic trade deals are anything but free trade or free market capitalism, but I'll let you google that). 

I think in this case Senator Wyden is turning his back on his Internet freedom values in order to appease powerful interests in his state. It's a shame. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think there are other serious issues that [EFF outlines here](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/final-leaked-tpp-text-all-we-feared), but I also wouldn't gloss over the serious danger of codifying the U.S. copyright law like DMCA and exporting it to other countries. Our copyright system is already fundamentally broken and deeply unbalanced in favor of large copyright holders (like record companies, hollywood, etc.) as opposed to user' rights and free speech. There are [many examples](https://lumendatabase.org/) of how copyright has led to censorship and the removal of legitimate content from the Internet. As the Web expands and becomes more crucial in our lives, we desperately need copyright reform here in the U.S. The TPP would not only prevent that, it would lock other countries into the same broken system, and prevent them from making their own decisions about how to balance copyright and freedom of expression. The TPP specifically enshrines all the parts of U.S. copyright law that protect large rightsholders, while paying only lipservice to fair use and other protections for free speech. Exporting the bad parts of U.S. policy without the protections is dangerous, and could lead to widespread Internet censorship. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whew! Love your passion.

I'll answer one of your questions and maybe others can answer others. 

Calling your representatives DOES HELP, but not all by itself. Hearing from constituents is definitely a huge part of how members of Congress make decisions on votes, but unfortunately there are lots of other factors, like who their campaign contributors are, what they're hearing from lobbyists and "experts" (sometimes real experts, sometimes "experts" paid by special interest groups, etc.)

The good thing is that organizations like the ones running this AMA are always using a variety of tactics to pressure lawmakers and make change. Bombarding Congress with phone calls is definitely one important piece of almost every legislative victory, so when you get an email from one of us asking you to make a call, please do! Sometimes even just a few dozen phone calls can sway a legislators vote.

Tweets are also a really good way to pressure lawmakers, so tweet at your reps too! 3

<TEXT> One thing to notice is that tons of the organizations that have fought really hard for net neutrality are also the leading groups opposed to more government surveillance. Strong net neutrality protections don't really make the FCC "bigger" or give them any power to regulate CONTENT on the Internet. It gives them power to  *prevent* Internet Service Providers from regulating your online experience. 

I share your general skepticism about government agencies like the FCC, but in this case, these rules were demanded by the public and they're a good thing for free speech. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-11-05 18:52:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Early this morning, the government of New Zealand released the [final negotiated text](http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Treaties-and-International-Law/01-Treaties-for-which-NZ-is-Depositary/0-Trans-Pacific-Partnership-Text.php) of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement (TPP.) 

Disclosure: I work for [Fight for the Future](https://www.fightforthefuture.org), a grassroots Internet freedom group that has been [opposing the TPP](https://www.fightthetpp.org) due to concerns over the lack of transparency and extremist copyright provisions that we feel could lead to Internet censorship and other threats to freedom of expression.

Since the TPP text was released this morning, we've been reading through it, starting with the Intellectual Property chapter. I'm pasting below my initial raw notes on what we've found so far. It would be awesome if others could read through it, see if they agree with our analysis, and add other sections of concern in the comments, so we can start to get a full picture of how this agreement will impact the Internet and related technology issues.

This list is also on a press release we put out this morning: http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/132605875893/final-tpp-text-confirms-worst-fears-shadowy

*Article 18.26: Term of Protection for Trademarks*
Increases the minimum protection for trademarks to 10 years, forcing countries to follow the U.S. model on this rather than make their own trademark policy based on the public interest. This will limit technological innovation and could curtail affordable access to medicines or other basic necessities.

*Article 18.37: Patentable Subject Matter*
Allows for the patenting of "new methods of using a known product," which essentially allows for unlimited patents from Pharmaceutical companies and will block affordable access to medicines and medical procedures and prevent innovation of better and more affordable healthcare procedures.

*Article 18:28: Domain Names*
This undermines anonymous online expression by requiring governments to keep a public database of real names and addresses associated with country code top level domain names, (such as .us, .au, .ca, etc). This is dangerous especially for the ability of opposition groups in repressive countries to voice their concerns online without fear of violent retribution.

*Article 18.63: Term of Protection for Copyright and related Rights*
This is one of the most egregious pieces of the deal. It forces the most draconian parts of the U.S.'s broken copyright system on the rest of the world without expanding protections for fair use and free speech. This section requires countries to enforce copyright until 70 years after the creators death. This will keep an enormous amount of information, art, and creativity out of the public domain for decades longer than necessary, and allow for governments to abuse copyright laws to censor online content at will, since so much of it will be copyrighted for so long.

*Article 18.68: Technological Protection Measures*
This section attempts to make it a crime to circumvent any "Digital Rights Management" (DRM) locks on a device, even if you own it. It could criminalize people who unlock their phones in order to use accessibility software, for example, or make it illegal to circumvent DRM on a computer in order to use Linux.

*Article 18.69: Rights Management Information* 
This section criminalizes basic activities that involve removing a Rights Management marker, even if its done in the process of creating something totally legal. For example, cropping a photo that has a watermark on it in order to use it as part of a fair use creation or as part of a political protest. And yes, that does include if you give credit elsewhere (like the description of a YouTube video).

*Article 18.78: Trade Secrets*
Criminalizes the "unauthorized and wilful disclosure of a trade secret including via a computer system." This is clearly intended to stifle whistleblowers and journalism covering the documents they expose -- it could criminalize, for example, The Guardian's reporting on the documents they received from Edward Snowden.

*Section J: Internet Service Providers*
This is one of the worst sections that impacts the openness of the Internet. This section requires Internet Service Providers to play "copyright cops" and assist in the enforcement of copyright takedown requests -- but it does not require countries to have a system for counter-notices, so a U.S company could order a website to be taken down in another country, and there would be no way for the person running that website to refute their claims if, say, it was a political criticism website using copyrighted content in a manner consistent with fair use.

Section J makes it so ISPs are not liable for any wrongdoing when they take down content -- incentivizing them to err on the side of copyright holders rather than on the side of free speech. 

Additionally, the Trans-Pacific Partnerships chapter on investments includes intellectual property as a matter that can be included in investor-state dispute settlements (ISDS). 

*Article 9: Investor-State Dispute Settlement*
No matter what else is in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, this section makes it bad for people everywhere. It allows companies to sue governments  but not the other way around. These legally-binding challenges are decided by arbitrators hired for that case only, and investors have every reason to stack the cases with as many standards violations as theyd like. Intellectual property is just one of the many things that investors can bring suits over, but we could soon see cases of investors suing governments because they think punishments and rewards for copyright or trademark violations arent enough to satisfy them. Decisions that impact the future of the Internet should never be made in secretive international tribunals  especially not ad hoc ones.

<TEXT> Facebook has shown themselves time and again to have little regard for their users' privacy. It's not that surprising that they'd be quietly supporting this bill -- it would give them sweeping legal immunity for a wide range of abusive data practices. It's also not surprising that they're doing it in secret rather than publicly, and then lying about it to the press. CISA is supremely unpopular, and Facebook knows that supporting it publicly would be a PR nightmare. It seems they've decided to avoid taking a stance and instead are just casually supporting it in closed door conversations with the Hill </TEXT>

<TEXT> A friend and I are diving into the text now. Some big takeaways:

* TPP would increase most country's maximum copyright term limits by 10 years

* TPP would allow companies to patent "new ways of using" an existing invention, which could create a somewhat infinite patent loop

* TPP could force ISPs to block pirate sites or other sites hosting infringing content (like SOPA)

* TPP would introduce new criminal penalties for modifying or unlocking your own devices

There's a ton more in there. Hope others will read the text and share their thoughts: https://wikileaks.org/tpp-ip3/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem here is that CISA doesn't provide ANY government "oversight." It just gives companies an easy out to basically shift the blame to the government. They participate in the program, share data with the NSA etc., and then when they get hacked they get to say "we were doing everything we could" when they weren't even using basic security practices. Meanwhile they get legal immunity.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I definitely feel your fatigue for fighting this particularly tenacious "zombie bill" (accurate term.) That said, working on this issue daily I've seen a big shift in the narrative around this in DC and in the media in general and I do think we still have a real chance at defeating this altogether, or at least delaying it again to give ourselves more time to build up opposition.

A lot more members of Congress are understanding that a bill like CISA won't do anything to stop breaches like the OPM hacks. The media is starting to make them sound like fools if they still think that. Those are good signs.

Getting tech companies on the record as opposing this bad legislation is one of the most effective things we can be doing. Everyone should tweet at / email the web companies they use and ask what their position is on CISA. With the entire BSA backing away from CISA there's a really awesome moment right now where we could get an avalanche of companies opposing it, like what happened with SOPA after the GoDaddy boycott. 

At the very least, we better go down fighting or the next bill they come up with will be 100 times worse. </TEXT>

<TEXT> TLDR: CISA is bad for security AND privacy

Yeah, in this case I think even if you trust that the U.S. government is benevolent and just doing the best it can to protect us all (which I don't, for the record) security and technology experts are saying that information sharing bills are STILL the wrong way to go, because they will result in lots more sensitive private data being spread across a lot of government agencies who are using antiquated systems and have a terrible track record of keeping their data safe. So CISA could actually result in even more devastating Cyber Attacks like the OPM hacks happening more often and the hackers making off with even more data.  </TEXT>

They're facing backlash for supporting so-called "cybersecurity" legislation that would grant companies legal immunity to share private user data with government agencies. So, it's about mass surveillance, which impacts free speech just like net neutrality, but it's not the same issue. Does that help? </TEXT>

Re: Boycott of Heroku and Salesforce services

Dear Mr. Benioff,

         I was disappointed to learn that Salesforce joined Apple, Microsoft, and other tech giants last week in endorsing the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA). This legislation would grant blanket immunity for American companies to participate in government mass surveillance programs like PRISM, without meaningfully addressing any of the fundamental cybersecurity problems we face in the U.S. Your support for this legislation is a short-sighted move that will decrease consumer confidence in American tech companies, both domestically and internationally, and, if CISA passes, will create broad new risks for every user of US-based cloud services. Accordingly, we will be abandoning your Heroku service within the next 90 days, and are encouraging others to do the same.

         As a former security professional and the CTO of Fight for the Future, an organization that fights for security and privacy, I strongly believe that national security and civil rights are not mutually exclusive. Its possible to craft meaningful cybersecurity legislation that protects peoples rights by encouraging strong encryption standards and responsible security research.

         Unfortunately, CISA does none of these things, and your endorsement of it reflects badly on Heroku and your other subsidiaries. Heroku has been an exceptionally convenient web hosting service, but in order to use it, we need to trust you with our supporters personal data. Salesforce is actively supporting a bill that would undermine that trust. If CISA passes, it will be impossible for us to guarantee our own privacy policy with our users, because Heroku may broadly violate their privacy agreement with us to share information about our users with the government.

         CISA provides enormous leeway for companies to share Personally Identifiable Information (PII) with government agencies like the NSA and the FBI, granting companies blanket civil and criminal immunity from any existing privacy law in the process. This blanket immunity might seem desirable to a tech industry that has been forced to participate in PRISM-style mass surveillance programs for years, since constitutional challenges to this surveillance may soon prove that the government and companies have been violating U.S. privacy laws all along. You may benefit from liability protection, but supporting it is short sighted.

         By supporting CISA, Salesforce is effectively lobbying to make their privacy policies null and void when it comes to sharing data with the government. You want to just give them the data and be done with ita remarkably irresponsible approach. The meager benefit of immunity from privacy laws will be eclipsed by the long-term cost to the tech industry as consumers lose confidence in American cloud services and abandon them for international or open-source options. Companies like Cisco have already had their revenue wiped out from the perceived threat of U.S. government surveillance. If CISA passes, billions of dollars could be erased from the greater U.S. tech economy, causing catastrophic damage to the same companies that endorsed it.

         In addition to being bad for business, CISA fails as a cybersecurity bill. Regardless of whether you believe the so-called safeguards written into CISA are adequate to protect people from government abuse and warrantless mass surveillance, it is incontrovertible that CISA will put more private data in the hands of a staggeringly wide array of government agencies. Agencies like the Department of Commerce, the Department of Energy, or the IRS are not equipped to safeguard this datain fact, both the IRS and DoE were recently breached. How would giving more private sector data to the U.S. government protect our cybersecurity when these government agencies cant even protect the data they already have?

         If its not clear already, Fight for the Future believes that CISA is not a cybersecurity bill; rather its a mass surveillance bill disguised as a cybersecurity bill. We hope you will reconsider your companys short-sighted support of this legislation. In the meantime, we will be migrating our tech infrastructure off Heroku. There are many alternatives, and we will be encouraging others to join us in moving to platforms that dont endorse government surveillance of their customers.

         Sincerely,



         Jeff Lyon

<TEXT> That's simply not true. Right now if a company shares data with the government in a way that violates their privacy policy or isn't in accordance with law, you could absolutely sue them and win in court. There are privacy laws they could violate or you could sue them for breach of contract if your a customer and they violated a written agreement. Yes, it's true that a ton of spying and data sharing happens in secret, but CISA would codify that and make it all 100% legal, removing any chance that we might have future court victories like the ones ACLU and EFF have been fighting for years. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think this is true that the thing holding them back is they have to figure out this issue with ads. That said, it's unacceptable and unethical for a site that houses this kind of sensitive user data ([related to a user's drug use habits, mental health, sexual preferences, sexual history, illegal activity, etc. etc. etc.](https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/okcupid)) to run a business model that prevents them from offering all their users at least a baseline level of security. HTTPS is standard web encryption -- we as Internet users need to start demanding it or companies will always drag their feet and choose the status quo and short term profit over longterm security and sustainability. It may seem to OKCupid like dealing with this ads question and switching to SSL is going to cost a lot of money and time, but I highly doubt it will cost them as much money and time as when something like Ashley Madison happens to them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah I think this is basically true for all extremely centralized forms of power. Big institutions tend to screw us over, whether they're governments, monopolistic corporations, religious institutions, even big NGOs and charity organizations.

Bills like CISA inherently push us toward more centralization and authoritarianism during a time when we have unprecedented ability to actually EXPAND democracy thanks to the power of the Internet.

Makes me mad.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah this is a good point. Rand Paul (while I disagree with him on many many things) did the Internet a solid when he filibustered renewal of some of the worst sections of the PATRIOT Act. 

Your huffpo jab is legit. But yeah I think the point of the headline is that people aren't talking about this bill as what it is: a deal between companies and the government to trade free information for legal immunity. This piece tries to get into the technical details of how it might work </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's Congress job to *represent* the American public, and in order to do that they need to hear from us. They hear from corporate lobbyists ALL THE TIME who drop by their offices, have their personal cell phones etc. The tools we at FFTF build are designed to give the general public that same level of access to Congress.

So yeah, i guess i'd have to say #SorryNotSorry :-)

<TEXT> The media is trying really hard to frame the TPP issue specifically as a fight between "labor" / "liberals" and "Obama." 

It's really helpful to write short op-eds, only like 600 words, for your local paper encouraging your lawmakers to oppose Fast Track and referencing a variety of reasons that show there is resistance from across the political spectrum. 

Some op-eds to sample from:
[The Hill](http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/241354-if-pelosi-supports-an-open-internet-she-should-oppose-fast)
[The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2015/may/08/trans-pacific-partnership-obama-irony)

<TEXT> There was a "snafu" where the Senate failed to get what's called "cloture" last week, but they played some inside baseball, struck a deal and eventually passed "Fast Track" for the TPP just today.

HOWEVER, the real fight over this has always been on the House side, and those close to DC are saying we did well in the Senate vote and we should keep the pressure on. You can contact lawmakers with a few clicks here: https://battleforthenet.com/internetvote

<TEXT> I actually for the most part agree with you -- it seems very likely that governments will continue various forms of spying no matter what laws are passed, and one of the most concrete things we can all do is protect ourselves. The third link, [Reset the Net](https://resetthenet.org), is an entire campaign focused around promoting encryption, both on the user side and among web apps and services.

That said, the fight against mass surveillance is a culture war. And one of the most public aspects of the government's disregard for our privacy are the BLATANT laws like the PATRIOT Act that straight up say it's okay for them to violate our basic rights. 

We have a real opportunity right now to put the government on the defensive, explaining to the public why these runaway programs should exist, and build a movement of people who agree that bulk collection of our private data is just not okay.

That will lead to more people speaking out and taking action, but also more people encrypting their shit, which makes mass surveillance more difficult and expensive to conduct. </TEXT>

<TEXT> but how much can the individual citizen do when even members of congress don't fully known whats in it?

There are a lot of things that individuals can do! The Japanese press just reported that a TPP ministerial was CANCELLED because Fast Track in the U.S. is still uncertain. We have been really successful in delaying it so far!

Here are things that redditors can do to help:

1) Contact your lawmakers in both the Senate and House. [This site](https://battleforthenet.com/internetvote) makes it really easy with just a few clicks.

2) Write an op-ed for your local paper about tech-related concerns with Fast Track and the TPP. The media wants to frame this as if it's just a fight between "liberals" and "Obama." We need more voices out there about why this is bad from a variety of perspectives. Use this op-ed in [The Hill](http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/241354-if-pelosi-supports-an-open-internet-she-should-oppose-fast) or this one in [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2015/may/08/trans-pacific-partnership-obama-irony) (disclosure: i wrote it) as fodder to write your own.

3) If you run a startup, website, or small company, call your representative's LOCAL DISTRICT OFFICE and request a meeting to discuss your concerns with Fast Track and the TPP. Even if they can't actually attend a meeting, getting lots of requests like this is a really powerful way to pressure them.

<TEXT> So this is mostly unrelated to net neutrality. Activists are the ones flying the blimp, not the Senator. They're pressuring him to oppose so-called "Fast Track" legislation that would push the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement (a massive trade deal like NAFTA) through Congress with a simple up or down vote and without meaningful debate.

From the latest leaks, we know the TPP contains extremist copyright provisions (think SOPA) that could lead to a more censored, policed, and expensive Internet.

<TEXT> It's true that its not over until all 5 FCC commissioners sing. And even then it's not actually over until we defend this victory in Congress and in court. BUT-- the little guys (and gals, and everyone else) of the Internet definitely do deserve to celebrate right now.

Even the fact that the FCC is going to vote on Title II rules on Thursday is literally something that people thought was impossible just a year ago. The internet has changed what is and isn't possible in washington, DC and that transformative power is exactly what the net neutrality fight is all about preserving.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah no, that's not what they mean at all. "Regulated like a utility" just means that they'll be using Title II "common carrier" rules, basically simple, bright line rules that ban Cable companies from abusing their gatekeeper power. 

This won't change the way you pay for your Internet, or make your ISP more like your water company, or anything like that. 

The Internet has flourished with net neutrality as a guiding principle since its beginnings. Comcast and Verizon et al want to break that principle so they can extract more profits -- the FCC was more than ready to do that until tons and tons of people spoke out and rose up.

This is a huge win for the public, don't get fooled by partisan nonsense in Congress. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When the media says the FCC is going to "regulate the Internet like water and electricity," they just mean that the legal mechanism that they will use to prevent discrimination is similar to the ones used to prevent water or electric companies from abusing their often near-monopoly status. 

Net neutrality protections will actually prevent the exact thing you are afraid of: it's just basic rules that prevent ISP's from charging websites and apps more for access to internet users. 

None of this is going to make your Internet company more like your water company, or anything like that -- the internet has flourished with net neutrality as a guiding principle since its beginnings, the FCC's move toward Title II is just enshrining that principle and making it illegal for monopolistic companies to break it and abuse their power. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for posting this. For me as an activist, it drove me freakin nuts when all the media came out with headlines about "Obama's plan for the Internet."

We had to fight tooth and nail to get the White House to endorse Title II reclassification and real net neutrality. Obama appointed FCC chairman (and former Cable company lobbyist) Tom Wheeler. We moved heaven and earth to get that guy to cave in to the public pressure finally get to where things are today.

This was not "Obama's plan for the Internet" -- it's what leading academics, Internet companies, free speech advocates, journalists, and millions of people have been calling for for years. Obama just happened to be President when we demanded it most loudly, and finally came through on his campaign promises around it.

I'm not really much into either political party, but one thing is for sure: we should not allow partisan nonsense in DC derail the biggest victory for the Internet since SOPA -- [we have to keep Congress from screwing this up.](https://battleforthenet.com/countdown) </TEXT>

<TEXT> No it's actually the opposite -- reclassifying under Title II would lead to *more* competition. It's separate from the issue of municipalities creating their own ISPs, but related, because Comcast et al have been lobbying hard for years and literally writing local and state laws that prevent that from happening, to keep themselves as the only choice.

I totally agree with you that the government screws all of us over. I just know that they work hand in hand with entrenched institutions like Comcast and Verizon to do it. That's why I support net neutrality. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We decided to meet the lobbyists head on by building tools that make it super easy for people to contact their government officials en masse. That's been the secret to the success of the net neutrality movement so far. Lobbyists from AT T and comcast are always down at the fcc whispering in their ear, so we built www.callthefcc.com to make it easy for people to flood them with phone calls. Same goes for Congress so we built this scoreboard so people can tweet and call their reps with a few clicks https://battleforthenet.com/scoreboard

Lobbying money can buy a lot of influence in DC, but in the end, politicians are worried about votes, and if we can build enough of a grassroots movement to make an issue politically toxic (like SOPA for example) we can win big victories for the public interest even with our totally broken political system.

<TEXT> Some problems with this argument:

-The market we have is anything but free, thanks to the influence that large monopolies have in Washington, DC

-The relationship between giant corporations like Comcast and the U.S. government is cozier than I think any of us are comfortable with. Net neutrality is a basic principle that's been around since the beginning of the Internet. Cable companies want to break it so that they can REGULATE THE INTERNET for their own profit. But once there is a system in place for regulating internet traffic, slowing down (or even blocking) some sites and speeding up others, don't think that the government won't call in their favors to Comcast when they want to censor something or control the flow of information.

-Net neutrality is not a "government takeover of the Internet" -- it's common sense rules that are based on how the Internet was built. It prevents Cable companies --who have been using their government connections to become local monopolies -- from abusing their gatekeeper power.

-Net neutrality / Title II doesn't give the government ANY power to "regulate the Internet" or "regulate Internet content" -- it is a set of rules saying that Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon can't discriminate.

<TEXT> Hey everyone,

I'm Evan. I work for Fight for the Future, one of the groups helping organize the [Internet Countdown](https://battleforthenet.com/countdown). 

It's awesome that this conversation is taking off and people are excited to talk about net neutrality and what it means for all of us Internet users. 

I just wanted to put a few helpful links all in one place in this thread, cuz links are good.

1) Email and call your reps: https://battleforthenet.com

2) Join the Internet Countdown with your website, blog, tumblr, or twitter: https://battleforthenet.com/countdown

3) John Oliver explains net neutrality, and makes you laugh the whole time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?x-yt-ts=1422503916 x-yt-cl=85027636 v=fpbOEoRrHyU

4) Net neutrality is not a partisan issue. Here's 6 reasons why conservatives should support net neutrality (even though the Republican party is being silly about it.) http://www.theverge.com/2014/11/10/7187501/6-reasons-real-conservatives-should-defy-republicans-and-support-net

5) Awesome op-ed about why net neutrality matters to the Black Lives Matter movement: http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/civil-rights/228063-black-lives-depend-on-a-free-and-open-internet

6) Find out where your member of congress stands on net neutrality (and give them hell about it) https://battleforthenet.com/scoreboard

EDIT: Oh, you people like links? MOARRRRR LINKS:

7) Long and detailed letter from 36 experts like Barbara Van Shewick and Lawrence Lessig to the FTC and FCC explaining why Title II reclassification is the only path to lasting net neutrality protections that Internet users need: https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2015/01/36-leading-scholars-federal-officials-only-fcc-can-protect-open-internet        

8) I wrote this kind of uplifting op-ed in The Hill about how I'm pretty sure we're going to win real net neutrality http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/230776-congress-you-cant-fool-the-public-on-net-neutrality

<TEXT> Technically, Verizon successfully sued the FCC to strike down the existing net neutrality protections we had last year.

But fortunately, everything we are hearing says the new net neutrality protections we are about to get thanks to massive public outcry, are way stronger than the ones Verizon sued to strike down.

So much so that they have actually been advocating for basically the regs that they sued to strike down, since they've lost so much ground in this debate.

So... go internet? </TEXT>

If the U.S. loses net neutrality protections, the Internet ecosystem fundamentally changes. The next iteration of apps, websites, ideas, etc. that would have / could have come out of the U.S. might not be able to get off the ground if there is no longer a level playing field. The Internet doesn't really know borders. People all over the world read blogs, use apps, or check out content that originates in the U.S. Whenever any government or corporation limits Internet freedom anywhere, it affects Internet users everywhere.

Finally, other countries are looking closely at how the U.S. deals with this. We need to get it right. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1) Start following some of the organizations working on this issue. This is going to be a longterm fight, and there will be more fights after this one, so get involved for the long haul!

2) Call your reps right now using the tool at https://battleforthenet.com -- i know this seems really small, but this is one of those moments where public pressure on lawmakers really does make all the difference. Tell them you're a law student, explain why net neutrality matters to you. 

3) Get some other students together at your school and organize a panel, protest, or other event about net neutrality to help spread the word and get more people involved. you can contact me at evan@fightforthefuture.org if you want some advice on that </TEXT>

<TEXT> Evan here from Fight for the Future. I am our campaigns guru and probably the least technical person on our team to answer this question. But here's my thoughts.

Basically, we at FFTF generally think that we should fight to make the Internet a better place with whatever tools we have available. For most issues, this involves a two-prong approach of fighting with policy and fighting with technology.

My personal hope is that advances in technology will lead to more decentralization that makes the gatekeeper power that Comcast et al have right now obsolete. But in the meantime, I think it's super crucial that we fight with everything we have to make sure that we have strong rules that protect the Internet from abuse by Cable companies that have a near monopoly on so many people's access to information. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I have male privilege even though I am not a man </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-01 22:16:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I posted this on my FB this morning and thought people here might be interested in reading it. xo

This may be too heavy for New Years day, but...

I have male privilege even though I am not a man.

This is something I've been thinking about a lot and talking to a few people about so I thought I'd write something about it here. Most of you probably already know that I identify as transgender and genderqueer. I made a transition a few years ago from presenting my gender in a more masculine way to generally presenting it in a much more feminine way, with lots of daily fluctuation that feels good to me.

I don't identify as a man, and I haven't in quite some time. But I do identify as a person with male privilege. I don't speak for any other trans or transfeminine person, just myself. But I'd really like for there to be a conversation amongst transfeminine people about male privilege and if/how we have/experience it. I know for a fact I have it and that it has benefited me in many (unjust) ways. I also know trans women who do not feel like they have male privilege, and feel like they never had it and never identified as a man. I affirm their experiences while starting this conversation. I also should say outright that "Trans-Exclusive Radical Feminism" is total BS and this conversation should not in any way feed that vile nonsense.

Here are some ways that I feel like I experience male privilege:

First and foremost, when I am out and about in the world, many people perceive me as a man. That's a funny kind of privilege, because it also means that many people misgender me, contributing to the oppression that I experience as a trans and gender nonconforming person. Being misgendered hurts, but it also means that I often don't experience sexism the way that other feminine-identified people do. That's a very real privilege that benefits me in often unseen ways. Within activist groups, when I speak on a panel or give a TV interview, and in other public settings, while people may be confused or annoyingly intrigued by my gender deviance, I am often afforded a speaking status that I can only describe as relating to my male privilege. People listen to me and consider my opinions to be authoritative in a way that they do not respect the opinions of many people who consistently present more feminine than me.

It's worth highlighting the way I phrased that last point: this has nothing to do with biology or genitalia. This is about how people identify and present throughout their lives, and how socialization impacts all of us.

Moving on, the second way that I experience male privilege is, I think, the more significant one. I was socialized as a boy. Along with my white privilege and class privilege, being socialized as male meant that I was encouraged to pursue my dreams and afforded opportunities that many people are not. Probably the most obvious example of this is my music "career." As a young boy, I was encouraged to play guitar and sing, I was bombarded with copious media representations of men playing music. I could easily imagine myself being them, or at least aspiring to be them. When I started performing, I was a boy and identified as such and I did not face traditional sexism while touring, booking shows, dealing with sound engineers, etc. etc.

Being raised as a boy means that I was essentially taught, both directly and subconsciously, that I was superior to women and other feminine people, for a huge portion of my formative years. In the same way that I experience the class privilege I benefited from growing up even though I am now relatively poor, I continue to benefit, unjustly, from the male privilege that I have had all my life, even though I no longer identify as male.

There are many flavors of trans experience. Mine is that I didn't really question my gender too much until I was in my twenties. I experienced a lot of bullying and social punishment growing up that I can now understand as relating to gender-deviance, but it wasn't something that I thought about through that lens at the time the way that many trans youth experience it. I definitely don't feel like my life experiences, even as a kid, were the same as most cis-men, but they also weren't the same as cis-women or the same as many trans women. So, I acknowledge that It's possible my experience of male privilege is not widely shared among other transfeminine people. But my guess is there are definitely some (maybe a bunch?) of other transfeminine people out there who experience male privilege in some of the same ways that I do. I think it'd be cool for us to get tea together sometime and talk about it.

In conclusion (don't they tell you not to use that in high school writing class?)  Let's end sexism. It will be awesome. </TEXT>
