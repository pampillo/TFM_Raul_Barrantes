<TEXT> Well my thought process right now is to keep it sealed until I can sell the mox. I'm very new to speculation but I've been looking at the cards and I think they could ride collectively. I think reserve list cards are going to go up over time just because they are collectible. Also, the only reason sol ring is worth anything in that print is because it's sexy af. As commander gets more popular I feel people will want it more. Also the whole set and packaging is just stunning and in low supply so I figured there's no harm in waiting it out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> About HF: HuntFactions, founded by spiffyFox, is a new and ambitious factions server, with a small yet dedicated player base.  While creating Hunt, we aimed to bring back the clean, simple, and bloody factions experience that has become so hard to find. The team is devoted to introducing and developing new, clean, and balanced features over time. For example, we plan on adding a custom end map, spleef with rewards, and custom items soon! HF Is an extremely new server, so as expected, we have a small player base. Most people who play on the server are also active on discord. Its a really great group! We yearned for a refined factions experience, a flashback to factions servers of a few years ago. We built it.
We are currently developing our Hub Expansion. This will include prison, skyblock, OP factions, survival, modified survival, and more!

<TEXT> Are you fucking kidding me? First off, I ain't rich. I'm putting a lot of money into making a genuinely fun server for kids of all ages. I myself am a huge fan of factions and I fully intend on playing myself. Secondly, if you spend two seconds on my server you will soon realize that those ranks really won't help you for shit. If your not good at factions those ranks sure won't help you, and if you are good at factions then you really could get everything in those ranks in one day. The singular feature that could maybe be considered cheaty in those ranks is the ability to change spawners for $20. However, we have an SS plugin so you really don't need it, and you know what? Fuck it. I'm allowed to sell out a tiny bit. I'm providing hours and hours of fun out of my own fucking pocket. If it was a balancing issue I would understand but it's not, so before you go shitting on people's work at least really check out the gameplay. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm trying very hard to differentiate my server. We have a lot of custom plugins on the way and some are here already. One big mechanic we have that has never been done as far as I know, is the shrine system I have created. Faction leaders, and leaders only, are given perms based on their factions stance. If the faction is in the top 15 on the leaderboards, the leader may go to the shrine and buy special equipment based on the rank (if the leaders faction is ranked first, they can buy any of the 15 items). This would allow him to equip his army with lightningbolts, rockets, and more. This also gives the leader a reason to use the faction economy, to raise money for the equipment. </TEXT>

My goal is to support a community of about 100 people, who are all social and very competetive.

<TEXT> Dear PCMR, I am fairly new to the masterrace, but I love it and I think the community is great. Many a meme and much news has been shared. We have posted news and ideas and participated in great banter. We are a glorious race, however, I feel we are not being very appreciative towards each other. I think if we are going to be the best technologically, there is no reason we cant exceed socially. Thus I think this issue should be addressed. 

All I am trying to say is our habit of daily giveaways is great, and it would be great if more people said thank you and gave a nice up-vote too, to show our appreciation. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey PCMR! So I picked up an old desktop from a friend's house that he was going to throw out. I can't decide what I want to do with it. I have quite a few steam keys laying arround and I figured ide give a few out to people who can give me some good ideas or advice. Thanks PCMR!

https://imgur.com/a/hvf4v

So I could just take it apart and use the HDD, not sure if I want to do that. I don't need media streaming because when I joined the PCMR recently I banished my xbone to the floor under the tv. All ideas are apreciated. Keys granted to a few I really like. Sorry I can't give all of you free games :(

EDIT: Thanks for all the advice guys! I wish I had more keys to give out but I dont. Peace.  </TEXT>

If I happen to be chosen I would love a Sades headset. I don't have a gaming headset so, well, yea. Or if a saints row 3 key is less trouble that would be really nice. I dont own it on PC. Stay cool OP! </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-05-01 04:26:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello there. So long story short, gaming is a huge part of my life and I love it. I recently (Early this business year) bought a gaming PC. However, though I have been gaming since I was very young, I have found my love for gaming is dying. I need to buy a new videogame, but I dont know what to get! Thats where you come in. I know what I want but I dont know where to find it. I used to play a lot of COD and such but I need something a bit different, as I got bored of COD a few months ago. I need something epic and fun. A bit more RPG. Grand Scale.

I tried BF4 and found that it was close to what I need but to big of a map for the amount of people. I tried CS:GO but simply didnt like it. I need more fast pace. I also was really into Titanfall for a bit, that fit my fancy. Maybe Star Wars Battlefront is good for me?

Also maybe something like Saints Row. Used to love that. Or something like AC Black-flag with more pirate stuff and less AC stuff. I dont know. Im lost! Please help. Any suggestion is a good suggestion, unless its a bad suggestion.

Thanks yall! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey there fellow android lovers. So I have what I believe to be a great idea for an app but I do not have the knowledge or skills to make it, so I present to you my idea. I use Google play a ton. Music movies apps books and news. I also like productivity and sexy looking apps. So I think it would be cool if someone managed to make a app that compiled your Google library (music and movies and such) into one app in the style of the play store. Hope yall don't think this is a waste of time, thankses! </TEXT>
