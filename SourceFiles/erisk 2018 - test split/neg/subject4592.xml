<TEXT> We don't need to pander to them.

But it is easier than passing pro-business AND socially conscious legislative, which what you need if you want small businesses or other companies to take over their market share.

Left has problem with pro-busyness  and right has problem with socially conscious part. So we usually end up with mishmash that does neither.

<TEXT> Actually energy boom is a good time to build.
Just like in times when economy is booming you should reduce deficit so you can prop up economy when times are tough.

Sure we have enough energy now, but stuff can and WILL happen that can change that. What if, for example, several large transformers across continent were destroyed by terrorist attack or computer virus messing up their control boards, in that case the energy market would collapse and local grids would be on their own.

If that happened the last thing you need is unstable and unreliable energy source like wind or solar. The transformers are not exactly easy to come by and take long to manufacture. Most countries have barely enough to run their grid even now.

<TEXT> Laffer Curve is bullshit. The underlying idea IS sound however. If you tax people too much it will break them.

The problem comes when globalization becomes a factor. When corporations can move around the globe easily, looking for place with lowest taxes and weak governments, the curve is deformed.

Opposite effect happens if you run a good redistribution scheme, with industry incentives, social safety net, healthcare, research and education investment. 

So all things said and taken into account. One should take the curve as a concept not as a gospel. A general rule rather than natural law.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> From the moment you're old enough to pay tax, you should be able to vote.

So five year old child should be able to vote after buying a candy bar using money from selling lemonade? Because VAT is a tax you know.

And if VAT doesn't count we should probably take voting rights from those who don't pay other taxes.

Unemployed people don't contribute to budget so they can't possible have anything to say./s

And what about 16 year olds living with their parents, with no income and independence? These probably shouldn't vote, because they don't pay taxes either. Right?

<TEXT> Reducing voting age is the worst idea ever. 

I for one am horrified with idea of people like 16-year-old-me voting.
Back then I was much more radical, I barely understood basics of economics or social services, hell I could barely file paperwork for my bank account and tax-breaks. 

People like that voting is the last thing you need. Sure old people don't share our ideals, but that is part of democracy. Changing the rules so that some people have less say in things is anti-democratic by definition.

Why not take voting rights from rich people, or neonazis, communists, union members, minorities or give two votes to "reasonable people" so that we get outcome we want?

<TEXT> In short: European countries generally exercise greater measure of control over their citizens, in exchange for that citizens receive various benefits: universal healthcare, social safety net, work regulations, price adjustments etc.

America has many of the same institutions but never puts them in effect completely. You have social security, but it has lots of conditions and is only for some people, you have state funded healthcare, but only for poor and old people and it's underfunded, you have work regulations, but they are mostly dependent on unions doing their job, you have laws that allow your government to regulate prices of medicine, but your government chooses not to so it doesn't hurt you companies.

On the other hand, European countries restrict their citizens much more than American government. Take voters IDs, in Czech Republic it's unthinkable to vote without official id. In fact they won't let you enter the booth, nobody cares about that. And when I tell people that Americans think IDs are oppressive and a way to silence minorities they think I'm joking.

And when I say ID's I mean this:
http://www.mvcr.cz/SCRIPT/ViewImage.aspx?physid=392823 docname=OP%202012.jpg

It has signature, date of birth, picture, place of birth, sex, marital status, citizen number (basically our social security number) and number of children.

Everybody gets it when they reach age of majority and loosing it can lead to serious trouble. If policeman asks, you better show it.  Not because you have to, the law is kind of vague about that, but because if you don't you look suspicious. Since everyone else does it pretty much automatically.

I don't have to talk about free/hate speech issues, we all know what they are about.

Another example could be gun control, many countries in Europe have gone completely bonkers with that. In UK not even most police officers have guns, much less people. And there are even restrictions on knifes.

Oh and EU politicians signed a law that makes search engines remove results if people ask them to. Right to be forgotten it's called, I will give you three guesses on who uses it most. 

Hint: It's not common people. ;)


Anyway American approach is more hands off, but the trade off is that if you mess up or have bad luck you are fucked. 

This worked rather well in the past, when it didn't take much to make it big. But these days the barriers are much higher and it is much harder for people to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. 


So in conclusion, American approach got America in number one spot in the world. If America wants to keep that spot it should try something new. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Obviously not when it comes to language, French is descendant of Latin after all. Technically it is regional dialect of Latin which diverged from original and eventually was codified as language of it's own but...
never mind.

The point is that French people and French state, are descendants of Franks and of Frankish realms. Franks were among the most Rome-friendly germanic tribes so they quickly assumed Roman identity, culture and language. It is no wonder that Franks founded first and second incarnations of Holy Roman Empire and in a way the Roman influence is seen to this day in French politics.

For example intolerance of minority languages, tendency to integrate colonies into political infrastructure of metropolitan France etc.

But nevertheless French are descendants of Franks just as Englishmen are descendants of Britons, Angles/Saxons, Scandinavians and Normans. To claim otherwise would be rather strange. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They were one of many germanic tribes, along with Franks (modern French), Longobards (modern Lombardians in Italy), Visigoths (modern Spanish) and Suebi (modern Portuguese and Spanish).

Angles and Saxons lived in north of what is today Germany, parts of Netherlands and Denmark. During migration period (commonly known as Barbarian invasions) they moved to Britain, specifically it's south east. 

Over time they mingled with local population, sometimes peacefully, sometimes violently and in the end only Wales remained in hands of native Romano-Brits.

In the end Angles and Saxons adopted identity, if not language, of people they conquered and took Romano-British customs as their own.
Few centuries later it was them who were on defensive, again from germanic tribes but this time from the north.

But that is another story. </TEXT>

But I have this feeling that whatever policy EU will adopt under pressure from France and Germany will ultimately only benefit, or overwhelmingly benefit, France and Germany.

Because right now, without UK, they are the most important countries in EU by far. Lets be honest, which countries in EU can oppose France and Germany if they're united on any issue?
Poland? Spain? Italy? Romania? 

No other country matches them in population, economic power, contribution to budget or influence.

<TEXT> To be honest Czech President doesn't have to do as much. His job is mainly representative, American President is on the other hand head of executive branch.

We have no idea what Zeman would do if he actually had to solve some of our countrys problems instead of just commenting on them.

That being said, you are right about both of them being senile.
Trump and Zeman both display tell-tale signs of dementia: increasingly limited vocabulary, confused behavior, reliance on family/inner circle for presentation (hey Ovcacek is basically Sessions!), declining oratory skills and last but not least lack of self restraint.

<TEXT> What amuses (scares me) is that Americans essentially elected their version of Zeman in 2016. 
The vocabulary, gestures, even the damn face and obsession with popularity and general stupidity. 

God help us all if these two guys ever meet. Because I'm pretty sure that would mean Trump getting drunk on slivovice and unlike Zeman HE HAS NUKES!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Same reason Trump is/was popular in USA, he's successful businessman and keeps saying that state should be run like corporation. And people think that's a great idea.

Doesn't matter that he robbed state blind during privatization or that he was communist State Security agent. He is successful therefore he must be the right guy.

I'm not kidding, this is almost exactly what one of his supporters told me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This should be higher. 

Let's be reasonable for a while. Trumps budget failed, Trumpcare failed, "Muslim Ban" failed, his proposed tax cuts are unpopular even among Republicans in congress and a day does not pass without him shooting himself in foot.

His team of cryptofascists is already falling apart (Bannon, Gorka, Flynn) and he can hardly even speak coherently.

This is not next Hitler or even Mussolini, this is a 70 year old man, probably with Alzheimer or other form of dementia, who was never really bright and who considers Fox News and Breitbart to be legit sources of information.

He lacks mental capacity to go week without humiliating himself or implementing any policy, so I don't think it's realistic that he takes control of most powerful country on Earth, especially given the fact that his own Secretary of Defense is known for being pretty patriotic and reasonable man (with bipartisan support btw). </TEXT>

Basically it had Jesus as Aryan revolutionary taking power from filthy Jews.

Edit: The movement fell apart after the war, but some ideas of it remained and were subsumed by traditional anticlerical and radical religious movements in Germany. Later they reappeared in some neopagan groups but never  became religion for itself again.

Take my great-grandfather, member of Czech nationalist organization (Sokol), officer of KuK army. His son spend most of the war in Gestapo prison and returned half crippled, half of his family barely escaped gas chambers and even that only thanks to "misplaced" documents.

<TEXT> Macron is better than Le Pen, but these comments keep reminding me that comparing people to Le Pen sets the bar really, really low.

I know that he panders to domestic audience, but this is not a way to help EU in the long term. 

Sure nationalists didn't win in Netherlands and Macron will easily win French election. But let's not forget that Wilders still got more seats than ever before, socialists in Netherlands collapsed, Macrons own party is barely a year old with basically no presence in parliament and at least third of French voters think Le Pen is proper leader for their country.

Not to mention Greece still unable to get out of the mess it's in, Turkey turning into new Iran and Russians undermining democracy left and right. 

This is not some renaissance of liberal values, at least not in my book. We have soldiers on streets of major cities now and attack almost every month, this is not time for more divisions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Heroes and Villains by BBC.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_and_Villains_(TV_series)

It covers several important military leaders, from Atilla to Napoleon, each episode is about 50 minutes long but the introduction can be skipped since it mostly just reiterates widely known facts.

Unless they are wrong of course. Anyway I always liked that series for it's production value and I have wondered how much freedom did they take with some of the history. Especially the ancient and medieval parts.

<TEXT> It's all about concentration of power. If you put all of it in hands of one actor you basically depend on his good will. It can be individual, company or state. 

Now firearms restrictions are in many ways reasonable, but at this point the system works well enough. Recent terrorist attacks were conducted by cars and illegal firearms not guns owned legally.
Restricting access even more is nothing but a cheap way to get points with panicking voters, it won't help at all. 

Now fighting against state with .38 revolver is absurd. Odds of victory are laughable, the point is not victory however.
It's the simple fact that some resistance will be offered and that people will have capability of defending themselves. That even decades after takeover there will be people capable of fighting back against oppression and that every dictator will have to deal with them like with thorn in his back.

Take a look at Chechnya. The rebels lost, bad, a good thing in a way because they were more like Russian Taliban than anything else.
But the uprising led to Putin implementing more hands off approach on Chechnya out of fear of another costly war.

Same goes for Columbia, the rebels were outgunned by order of magnitude but they still brought government to negotiation table. 
Vietnam is another example where relatively small organisation managed to secure political gains.

Same goes for muslims in Mindao, their power was pathetic but they were annoying enough that Phillipines had to make concessions.

I don't judge morality of these movements (I think I would get banned for it), but the fact is that even limited armed resistance can accomplish much more than wider unarmed resistance. </TEXT>

But I also know that this is kind of inevitable and already largely in place. The electronic transactions already form backbone of commerce, most money is really just numbers anyway since we ditched the gold/silver/potato/whatever standard and so far system mostly works.

What I'm more worried about are restrictions on freedom of speech like right-to-be-forgotten laws and state taking our arms away.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> These ratings are not exactly objective because they measure what is essentially subjective. 

For example hate speech laws, right to be forgotten and food libel laws have almost no impact on the ratings even though they curtail freedom of speech/press in an enormous way.

Another problem is that control over information/press is directly tied to how people perceive said control. If you convince people that this or that measure is reasonable in civilized society it will not impact your rating as much.

Finally, humans trouble when it comes to non-binary ratings. That's why youtube no longer has stars. People tended to either give five or one star in order to have more impact on the ratings of the video. 

So in conclusion, the ratings should be taken as a valuable but flawed. Good as a rough estimate but not to be taken as ultimate judgement. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The colonial wars themselves were similar in terms of victims to French war in Vietnam (Battle Dien Bien Phu by itself is responsible for at least ten thousand dead) was similar in scale and brutality, plus it directly led to infamous Vietnam War but it gets swept under the table. 

Instead people focus on Americans who were involved in the region decades later.

And don't get me started on how the region turned out after all locals got independence. I know it sounds bad but the fact is that local rulers brutalized their people more than 20th century colonial powers (not 19th century mind you, Belgium itself breaks scales in that century). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually I do know a lot about history, at least I think so.

I can describe reasons for 100 Year war and tell you how it contributed to establishment of France as continental power, decline of Navarre and ultimately caused War of Roses and radical change of English monarchy from essentially Norman to really English institution. 

I can tell you about all the times France switched alliances just to bring down Holy Roman Empire, I can tell you how Cardinal Richelieu essentially founded realpolitik and how France allied with Turkish sultan to weaken their common foes.

I can tell you why does the British monarch have title Defender of the Faith and about Britain under Cromwell.

So I don't know maybe I'm just ignorant easterner. 

But what I do know is that in past year the climate around here changed from "We are Europeans we like each other now you frogeaters/barbarians-with-no-taste-who-fucked-us-at-Dunkirk" to "Go away we are better without you, you just kept us down anyway, and better go bankrupt and fall apart or we help you with it."

Now that minority of Americans elected Trump (basically Berlusoni with worse haircut) they can act like you are de facto dictatorship and worse than Iran.

Don't believe me? Compare threads about America in 2015 and today, you will see pretty big change.

Seems like shooting yourself in a foot with nothing to gain, on the other hand it's not like Germany/EU likes Israel anyway so pissing EU politicians off won't hurt the relationship much.

On the gripping hand, Netanyahu wants to get some domestic support by looking strong and capable, which I guess trumps (pun somewhat intended)  every other consideration. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good idea, but it won't happen.

The thing is: Paradox can't make good AI. The games themselves are good, but when it comes to AI decision making, whether it's pathfinding, resource management or diplomacy, frankly sucks.

For example rulers marrying random low ranking nobles with no traits, allies unable to follow wargoals, armies can't find path, mismanagement of Traders and fleets, England, Spain and Portugal unable to cross sea (they had to add straits just to make it easier).

The list goes on. The point is that AI sucks and Paradox knows it, they don't want to burden already malfunctioning process with more variables. You would end up with AI regularly going bankrupt or even unable to properly make armies in first place.

<TEXT> Well I wouldn't support the strike if it DID cause real damage. As bad as Assad is he is much better than ISIS and we still need his military to secure Syria. 

The strike was meant to be a message, that was clear from the start, sure it might have been motivated by Trump trying to divert attention.


But I personally believe, and this is a hunch based on personally knowing several people with it, that he actually has Alzheimer and that ordering the strike might have been simply extreme emotional reaction to seeing pictures of dead children.

Now that doesn't make him a better person or better president, but I very much doubt that he is even capable of conducting any sort of conspiracy with Russian government. The guy has vocabulary of eight year old and seems unable to go week without humiliating himself. Frankly, if anything he is a definition of useful idiot. </TEXT>

It also doesn't help that Democrats no longer field candidates in some districts so people have literally no choice left.  Not to mention another genius decision of abandoning the state level game in GOP states, leading to lost assemblies in entire midwest. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You know it is funny, in a terrible sort of way. That, in order to fight misogyny, your school decided to deprive you of choice and information. Two things that are best weapons against any sort of discrimination. 

It is also interesting that this is not an isolated incident. In past two decades many western progressives decided that, rather than fight real wrongs in society, they should focus on token issues like language (PC culture, pronouns etc.), fabricated issues like wage gap and absolute non-issues like lack of minorities in Academy awards nominations. 

Instead of fighting real injustice like sexual slavery, misogyny in middle eastern law or infanticide in much of the developing world they started to fight for showing their nipples and for right to not feel offended. And thus they caused more damage to their cause than any conservative ever could.

Anyway, at later start dates it's not much better, the authority of Orthodox religion sucks, because two holy sites are already occupied and one is immediate danger from start. If that was not enough, the Patriarch is vassal, which sounds good but the fact is that he will often plot against emperor. So the emperor might have to kill him, a lot, or the patriarch kills him. Which impacts his piety and thus authority of religion.

<TEXT> -1 does not seem like much for human player, because we are to CK2 AI what Culture Minds or Politys AIs are to us.

We know the rules, we know how to bend them, we have access to knowledge far beyond anything the AI has. When we see factions forming we pay them off, assassinate leaders, imprison members, we even start small civil wars just to prevent larger ones.

AI can not do any of this, it's behavior is determined by traits of the character, opinions it has of other characters, options defined by devs and RNG. 

AI sucks at this game, it plays as five year old or even worse, it can not plan in the future, it has almost no memory and it can hardly even find path for armies. 

So when it gets -1 opinion modifier it sticks, and it has cascading impact on levies, taxes, factions etc.

TLDR: It might be nuisance to us but for them -1 can be dynasty killer. It might take generation or two but in the end it gets them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When it comes to conspiracy theories you shouldn't start with big lies, start with small ones.

First they are what brought that individual to bizzaro world of conspiracy nuts, second the person in question will not act as defensibly when you contradict him on seemingly minor points.

As an example, if someone says that religion stunted science ask him for a specific example and refute that, instead of explaining him why entire thing is bunk.

Now if someone believes in cultural marxism you should attack minor points of his beliefs. Don't focus on history too much. Conspiracy theorists often believe that historians are corrupt and records falsified. Focus on technical points, more recent the better.

More often then not, these people started with genuine grievances and it escalated from there. Try to understand when and how it all started and that gives you power to end it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep, you are done.

Well there is a slim hope for you but it is a big risk.

1. Take few counties in north of France, Brittany seems pretty weak, it will do.

2. Stop attacking everyone and send your heir and all other child family members to court of French king for education, failing that try local Christians. Yeah, survival means converting, but it gets worse.

3. Move your capital to your new provinces, pump all money you can into infrastructure in your new capital and give as many titles as you can to your converted family members. If you have spare money upgrade their castles too. 

4. Take your realm apart. Sorry, you have nice kingdom but you can no longer hold it unless you want your hearth torn out and showed down your throat. Release your vassals, one by one, start with northern counts a proceed to south of England. Make as many new realms as possible, it will slow down Aztecs because of the truces and and problems involving multiple duchies.

5.Finally get rid of your kingdom title, doesn't matter how just do it. And then swear fealty to French king.
in a century or so you can get French throne. If you play your cards right you will be able to form Francia or other empire by then and Aztecs will lose some steam.

<TEXT> Combination of things, government is one because viceroyalities rip opinions to pieces.

 Apart from that there is issue of religion, Byzantium is one of few, well probably only major realm with heretics in charge while rest of the population is still the main religion.

This means that in best case Byzantium loses century converting all it's provinces and nobles and crushing local revolts, while being attacked on all sides by more monolithic realms. Worse option is a civil war, which is pretty much unavoidable because emperor and his heir suck balls. 

The dynasty is replaced but the problem remains because new dynasty has to deal with adventurers for next few decades while being under attack from south and north. Not to mention local revolts from few Iconoclast provinces that you have to convert back.

Last but not least, the lands of Byzantium are incredibly vulnerable. As we all know, enemies with HW CB are both in north and south, and to make things worse they are big, powerful and consolidated. 
Even if emperor wins wars against external aggressors he depletes his forces, making factions powerful enough to challenge him and leading to another civil war.

It's a clusterfuck, and AI has almost no way to manage it because, to be honest, it's barely capable of survival anyway.

So those are the reasons. </TEXT>

For example Miles Morales, good story, an interesting character, but the announcement of new Spiderman was overshadowed by how forced it felt.

It felt like bunch of suits sat around a table and said: "We need minorities in comic books. Lets make new Spiderman black. And you know what, lets make him gay too, I bet that will get us the queer readers, everyone knows they just read about gay people."
And then another one said: "You know, our readers are mostly liberal. I heard that liberals like mexicans now. Lets make him Hispanic too!"

It felt forced and for many people it was incredible turn off that made them shy away from entire series.

And even though it was good the stain remained.

It's just that Americans decided that government is satan so they don't want to give it money to save their lives. And american politicians turned that into policy. If you Americans trusted you government a little bit more you would have healthcare like rest of the developed world does.

But instead you vilify the very institutions that ensure your lives and safety. </TEXT>

As for those asking if these things are real. Yes they are, and not just in China. Along with sterilizations they are classic tool of authoritarian regimes, I speak from second hand experience in this case (I'm a man) but I know that it used to happen in my country (Central Europe) just few decades back. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And here lies the problem. Some argue that it's hard to draw a line at some date. The argument that women have right to choose if they want to have the baby or not can be made one or eight months into pregnancy. There are some who suggest that there should be no time limit on when you can terminate the pregnancy.

Now it is a fringe argument, but it was made. Another problem is where should the line be drawn and if there are any real reasons to think that it should be allowed 24 weeks in and not 25 weeks in.

The earliest viable birth was 22 weeks in pregnancy, so technically the limit could be put further back. In Europe most countries allow abortion on demand only during first trimester (12 weeks of pregnancy) and allow abortion later only for serious reasons.

So in a way Americans have de jure looser laws about abortion than Europeans already. On the other hand the access to health care is much, much better in Europe. I would be death if I lived in USA for example, or at least in debt and homeless. 

On the gripping hand, the entire debate is extremely heated and irrational, because one of few things all humans agree on is that killing babies is wrong. And when you define fetus as a baby then you can hardly argue for someones right to kill it. And if you see fetus as collection of cells you can hardly understand position of those who would want to preserve it at all costs.

<TEXT> Long Now foundation does some work but in very specific area like clocks and languages.


The good thing is that most conceivable cataclysms, even large scale nuclear war for example, leave at least some industrial capacity intact. 

Just by virtue of all nuclear powers being on northern hemisphere the southern hemisphere should survive relatively unscathed. They would have to endure a nuclear winter, but their cities and factories would be spared the blasts.

The catastrophic climate change is even better in way, because its effects would not be so harsh for industrialized, modern nations.
Thus possible recovery would be easier.

One way or another we should make reserves and have some sort of plan B in case our first attempt at world civilization does not work out.

<TEXT> People often assume that medieval Europe was primitive. But in reality the upper echelons had access to much of the same things that late romans did. Especially in western and southern Europe.

Cyphers, basis of espionage, banking and accounting all of it was there along with centuries of experience with diplomacy and subterfuge. King Phillip IV actually had a guy very skilled in those things.

<TEXT> No one really did much of a research in that regard.

We know how it happened in history but how would it work if we got hit by comet or nuked ourselves to oblivion, I don't know.

What I do know is that if shit hits the fan we probably won't have access to computers. Or that we shouldn't count on it.

So if I would make some sort of doomsday Vault it would have to be pretty lowtech, with lots of resources like metals, fuel and polymers so that civilization can get a head start.

For example, right now a metric ton of copper costs 5848 USD, lets we would buy about 500 000 USD worth of it, that's roughly 85 tonns for price of 7 Teslas model S.

That's not so bad for a supply that could prop up a town or two.

Same goes for steel, iron, nickle, tin, pretty much all basic industrial metals, seriously storing them in case something goes wrong might not be a bad idea.

As for the knowledge itself. Unless we get very, very unlucky, some people will still be able to read, at least for a generation or two.
So if you write it down in all the world languages you have pretty good chance of them being able to understand it.

But it should be resilient, rock preferably or ceramics, not paper or something else that can mold or burn. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They were not enthusiastic about it, but most of them were Christians anyway. The area got Islamized in last few centuries, before that it looked like Lebanon or Smyrna looked in 1800s.

No the biggest problem was not religion but economy, the region was not very rich back then, the trade routes could easily bypass it, and to make matters worse there was almost no support from rest of the Christendom after Crusade itself. 
Romans mostly wanted to make crusaders into their vassals, they even signed treaties and everything, Italian cities saw the holy land as source of profit and didn't hesitate to put money ahead of faith (4th crusade for example) and secular realms of western and north Europe had their wars between each other.

So only one left to actively support the crusader states was Pope, and even back then he was mostly ignored by secular rulers when it was convenient. 

So they were alone, surrounded by enemies, with no money and internal strife. To be honest it was not a situation they could win.

Unless of course the Mongols converted to Christianity, which was a real possibility for a while.

<TEXT> Actually local muslim population worked rather well with their new overlords. I think I even read about one arabian scholar who was really pissed about that.

Edit: Found him Ibn Jubay of Andalusia. Here is what he wrote about local situation

*We left Tibnin by a road running past farms where Muslims live who do very well under the Franks-may Allah preserve us from such a temptation! The regulations imposed on them are the handing over of half of the grain crop at the time of harvest and the payment of a poll tax of one dinar and seven qirats, together with a light duty on their fruit trees. The Muslims own their own houses and rule themselves in their own way. This is the way the farms and big villages are organized in Frankish territory. Many Muslims are sorely tempted to settle here when they see the far from comfortable conditions in which their brethren live in the districts under Muslim rule. Unfortunately for the Muslims, they have always reason for complaint about the injustices of their chiefs in the lands governed by their coreligionists, whereas they can have nothing but praise for the conduct of the Franks, whose justice they can always rely on.* </TEXT>

All I'm saying is that his contribution to the problem is not nearly as immense as some people try to portray it.
 I think the guy is an asshole who lived on his fathers money and wasted a lot of them, I think Russians helped him into the White House (whether he knew or not is a different issue), I think he is about as fit to be president as socks of  G. H. W. Bush.

But I do resent sensationalism, I do reject hysteria and I do not like when people twist facts just to push their view. 
I also don't like people locking themselves from other opinions.

And you know why I don't stand for those things?

Because that's what got DONALD TRUMP INTO OFFICE, sure Russians helped, sure DNC sabotaged Bernie and sure Hillary was overlooking blue collar workers. 

But real damage was done by people who remained locked in their newsfeeds, torturing facts, whipping numbers and overlooking hard truths only to pretend that America was falling apart and that only solution was to Make It Great Again.

Mind you, it will take decades to get there.

But the flooding is not the biggest problem. See, when sea water gets in the ground it ruins the soil. So goodbye produce from low laying coastlines. 

Anyway there are about five solutions, just out of my head to take care of that. But nobody has the balls to actually start working on them.

Oh and BTW, reducing the emissions will not work anymore, we should have done that a decade or two ago, right now the house is on fire, no use to stop indoor smoking. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because you don't want to get your hands dirty, and neither does EU or anyone else.

See, Haiti is failed state, almost a definition of one to be honest. The government acts more like another gang, bribes are universal, infrastructure gone, people malnourished, healthcare worse than in USA (couldn't help myself, sorry), exhausted soil, no natural resources of note, superstition entrenched in all strata of society and oligarchs acting more like feudal overlords on top of it.

You can't solve this with just money or by sending doctors and engineers.

If you want to solve this you need PROTECTORATE, you need to overthrow the government and create new one from bottom up, crack down on crime, create new legal code, reeducate the population so they give up their superstitions (religion is fine but witch doctors and witch hunts are too far) and create new regulations and institutions.

And you need to do all of this with army on the streets or else they will just ignore you, and you need to restrict freedoms of the locals so they don't stop the process when they get uncomfortable (and they will).

Media will paint you as next Hitler, people will die, your popularity will plummet and it will cost like Iraq-war.

So it's no wonder nobody wants to actually help.
It's much less of a hassle to just send them few million USD now and then, or let UN nations ship their reprobates there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As /u/deudeudeu said the syntax is the obvious problem.
It complicates things for developers, especially now when almost all major languages use extremely similar syntax.

Another thing is that different platforms like to add things to the language with very little regard to ANSI norm.

That creates inconsistencies and complicates things during migrations and education. In some cases SQL on different platforms looks more like different dialect than the same language.

Granted those are mostly cosmetic problems.
But just like that wart on a toe that no one sees, it keeps reminding you that it's there and sometimes it hurts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally I don't think this is some kind of massive fraud.

Not even Republicans have that much power in swing states and don't forget who was president at the time, I didn't see eye to eye with Obama on many security issues but I doubt, really doubt that he would let the biggest electoral fraud in history of United states happen on his watch.

So while it is depressing I think that the truth is much more terrifying. People didn't give a shit.

And by the way, almost every democracy has that problem today.
America just gets hit the hardest because of First-past-the-post system. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Republicans are politicians, that means they say whatever they believe will keep them in office.

Their base demands from them to act "tough" on "leeches" and part of that is pretending that Social and Medicare are abused by millions of welfare queens.

They know it's bullshit, well most of them do, you don't finish Ivy league school unless you are very intelligent. 
But their voters don't know that and demand that something should be done about it.

And so Republicans throw shit at those programs while pocketing bribes and passing laws enriching them and their friends.
And both sides are happy.

You are not happy and most Americans are not happy, but they have consented to that by not showing at the elections.

It is really astonishing, for centuries people fought and died for their right to elect their own leaders, and now that they can they don't want to do it.

Of course you can say that it's because of gerrymandering, but that is more of a symptom than the cause.
The Republicans could never pass the needed legislation if they didn't have votes for it. 

What is even more amazing are the election demographics, you would think that poor people, minorities and young people will show  up the most. After all they are the most vulnerable and dependent on their country.

Wrong, young, poor and minorities vote least of all. 

You would expect people to be energized by last years elections, but instead the USA had lowest turnout in 20 years.
At this point the blame rests not just on the politicians but also on the electorate.

TLDR: Democracy doesn't and cannot work when people don't participate. </TEXT>

It will come down to net contributors to EU budget, which are just Germany, France, Spain and Italy, they have leverage to pass pretty much any law they want in EU parliament and to make our governments sign almost any treaty.

<TEXT> From my experience it mostly depends on how much time do you have, if you are willing to make compromises on quality and of course your skill.

You can scavenge lots of stuff like stepper motors from old printers, sometimes you can even use their axis but they rarely have the required qualities.

What you can't do without is microcontroller, Arduino is the obvious option, it has lot of open sourced projects you can use for code and circuitry. Not to mention shields tailor made for similar purposes.

You can have someone with 3D printer make you the gears and smaller parts, so you can save a lot on that.

The larger parts of the assembly you can make yourself, if you have schematics and small workshop its not that hard.

Of course all of this, while cheap, will cost you a lot of time, especially if you never did it before. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From what I know lot of Republicans/Trumpists actually are upset and ashamed. The problem is that these are not nearly as visible as those that still support him.

His approval rates keep falling, liberals didn't like him from start so only logical explanation is that his own base is deserting him.
As for GOP itself, they are scared as fuck.

Don't get me wrong, GOP fuck people over all the time but they at least try to look good doing it. Trump makes that strategy impossible, he is so visibly criminal that it makes entire GOP look like crooks, even in the eyes of their voters.
To make things worse if he is not subdued by 2018 elections people could go and actually vote for Democrats.

In lots of districts Republicans only win because majority of the population DOESN'T SHOW UP, if these people get pissed/scared you can bet your ass it won't help some House members get reelected.

Technically speaking Trump is much worse for conservatives/GOP than for liberals/Democrats. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes it is simplistic I know that. I don't have time or energy to discuss this at length so I resort to short summaries. 

My point is, that today it's sometimes presented like clear cut kind of conflict, fascist vs. democrats, when in fact it was much more complicated and looked more like Syria today then American revolution in 1700s.

Anyway, time and time again, when these types of conflicts erupt, the most ruthless and radical factions tend to win.
For example: Russian revolution, Syrian civil war, French revolution, Chinese civil war, if we are really liberal with definitions than Germany in 20s/30s, Iranian revolution, Cambodia, the list goes on and on.

Sure in the end the things stabilized but only after often decades of terrible oppression and immeasurable slaughter. 
So, my personal opinion as a person with next to none academic history education, is that in the end victory of moderate republicans was very, very unlikely. </TEXT>

As I said before its supply/demand problem, more available workers means you don't have to try so hard to keep those you have, thus you can lower the wages.

<TEXT> I don't think anyone is trying to say that there is high unemployment, well at least I'm not trying to say that.

I just think that jobs people have right now often don't pay enough for them to have decent life. 
And when you boil it down to basics this is supply/demand problem.
The price of labor goes down if there are more laborers available, especially if these laborers have less bargaining power.

Now I don't think that those illegal immigrants/H1B visa workers are unionized, or that they are super confident in standing up to their employers. 
In fact I would think that when they complain they are told something like:"Well Raj I hate to tell you this, but there are dozens of people waiting for your place, so shut up and take that overtime or you go back to India." </TEXT>

<TEXT> The RISC stands for Reduced Instruction Set Computing.
These CPUs use only the most commonly used instructions with as few bells and whistles as possible. 

This allows better optimization, so as long as you want relatively simple stuff from the CPU you get potentially huge gains on performance compared to CISC (for example Pentium).

Now for most users these gains are negligible, but in industrial applications they can be critical. 

In addition the RISC CPUs have less trouble with waste heat compared to those using CISC, because of that they are heavily employed in microcontrolers, smartphones, IoT and pretty much everywhere else where you can't afford an extra fan.

Also fewer instructions mean that learning the assembly for these CPUs is relatively easy, now for most uses that barely matters but when it comes to critical (and I mean CRITICAL) applications it can be worthwhile to check what exactly did the compiler produce out of your code.

There bunch of other reasons but for me these top the list.

Dealers on street usually have their territories marked out, they are part of certain hierarchy (their at the bottom BTW), and generally prefer to stay alive, which is hard to do if you kill your customers.

<TEXT> New drugs, no question, while meth, heroin, coke etc. have a lot of "testing" these things are pretty much unknown.

 Nobody knows the "safe dose", nobody knows the long term effects, how addictive it is or how high it gets you. You have equal chance of feeling the high of you live and of getting into coffin.

The reason is that "producers" of these substances are developing them as fast as possible so that governments can't ban them.
Therefore they usually just feed it to rats and if they survive they give it to few junkies desperate for anything to give them kick.

If they get high and survive for at least few days then the shit goes into production, nobody wants their customers dropping like flies but if they die later nobody cares.

<TEXT> Well everyone benefits from GMOs so that's pretty much impossible.

But on a more serious note, it depends on what you consider independent. Is it enough when the study was not industry financed? 

And what if the researchers received grants in the past or the future form biotech companies, and what if the university got some funding from these corps around the same time.

If you want the first one that is possible, if you want the second that's pretty much impossible.
 Almost all companies that need university educated personnel are somehow engaged with universities, in order to search for talent mostly but also to pick up trends, boost their research and to get publicity. 

BTW the same goes for climate research, almost all institutions working on it are somehow connected to those who can get something from it.

<TEXT> The thing is that nuclear bombs don't have an infinite shelf life.

In fact they degrade much faster than most people think. 
So basically you can have a lot of them on paper but when it comes to actually using them you can end up with very expensive paper weights. 

Plus the number of nuclear bombs has dropped a lot in past few decades.

Don't take me wrong it's still not the investment I would make or recommend but it's not exactly crazy either.
 
Not to mention the fact that they're high tech weapons and if you want to make them and the missiles to carry them you will need a lot of engineers and funding for nuclear RnD which is not a bad thing either.

It would be nice to have possibility of alternative outcome.

<TEXT> Well I'm foreigner too and I have been asking the same questions for past few months. Basically it boils down to this:

President Trump is viewed as a problem by both Democrats and Republicans. Democrats I don't have to explain, Republicans are little more complicated. Lot of his policies go against the unhindered capitalism and free trade deals they like so much, unlike most of them he does not have a problem with LGBT people, he used to be Democrat for a long time and not so long ago used to support universal healthcare. Last but not least he does seem to be actually insane.
All and all he is not your traditional Republican and party leadership didn't want him to succeed in primaries, much less become a president.

Now in order to get rid of him he needs to be impeached, for that he needs to be guilty of treason, bribery, or other high crimes.

Here comes the fun part, what is and isn't the high crime is technically defined by the Congress. And Republicans have majority in both chambers.

But all it takes is few "swing votes" and Democrats will take care of the vote, and conveniently, they will also receive most of the blame from Trumpists while Republicans can claim that it's a stab in the back by Democrats.

Unfortunately, the moment Trump loses presidency his Vice President Mike Pence become president. And believe me that guy is maybe sane, but he is still an asshole. But an asshole that will do what Republican party wants from him, unlike Trump.

Right now both Democrats and Republicans are trying to build as strong case against him as possible. Otherwise he might slip away or make someone take the blame.

Still, both Republicans and Democrats hope that he can be tamed or subdued. At least a little bit. Republicans are afraid of backlash from Trumps supporters who will inevitably feel betrayed, while Democrats secretly hope that Trump breaks Republican party into pieces and liberals will be so angry at him that they will show up at elections two years from now. Because turnout is notoriously low when it comes to midterms and liberal voters.

Even this arch is actually almost never seen since its under several buildings, these days its mostly used as haven for tourist boats.

Anyway there are several other remnants, two sculptures, one which is used as way to measure flooding risk called Brad, no one know who it was, some say the architect. 
The other one is inside the old guard tower on left bank of the river. The tower is now connected to the one build for Charles bridge.

<TEXT> 1:So if the evidence does not support your case you discount it?
Ok, maybe you know more than that guy, still it would be nice if you pointed out what was wrong with his methodology.
The one you liked actually shows that C++ is faster and curiously does not include data for programs compiled using GCC on Windows. Because of that the data is incomplete and basically worthless. Not to mention the fact its over a decade old.

3: Yes he uses large number of objects but considering how little data they contain it shouldn't impact memory much (Note: I haven't seen report from his profiler or his code I am kind of shooting it the dark here).
One way or another he doesn't need to insert/delete data from it, all he needs is data retrieval from what is essentially fixed sized structure and some basic arithmetic with it, followed by overwriting of data. 
Essentially just get/set operations which are faster in arrays.


5:Seeing that this simulation took more than hour (I think OP wrote that somewhere) I think that he calls the constructors in every iteration. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1:I guess it depends on the purpose of the application and your skill, however especially when it comes to relatively simple mathematical operations and arrays (which is the case here) the C++ does have an edge.

3:Depends on what you want from them. In this case the size is set before the execution, therefore more advanced stuff the Lists implement is not necessary. 
You can do just fine with the array.

5: He has over three hundred thousand of them, if the constructors are not optimized properly he will get lot of wasted cycles. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) is good if you are writing in C++, it might be an overkill but it's multi platform and well documented.

There are other options like [Cairo](https://www.cairographics.org/) and [GTK+](https://www.gtk.org/),  finally you might try OpenGL, but that's seriously overpowered. It might be interesting learning experience however.


Anyway, if you can you should take a look at method calls your program makes, most IDEs have some helpful features when it comes to that, that way you can figure out where are you spending most resources. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nice work.
If you want some tips here is the stuff I found out while implementing my cellular automaton, which is in principle same thing:

1. Use compiled language, C/C++ works best. You will have to use third party graphics library but you will get lot of efficiency compared to JAVA.

2. Make sure you only check neighbors you need to check, there is no reason to check neighbors of the same type.

3. Simple data structures like arrays are more efficient than lists.

4. Compute results for entire field at once, not in series like you seem to do. Otherwise you will get weird results.

5. If you use objects to describe individual pokemon consider alternatives, it is very resource intensive when you consider what you need them to do. Try simpler data structures. Especially when all you need from them is basic math.

<TEXT> For start the pipe is going to be under the lake Oahe, about 90 feet below the lake in fact, on both sides it will have automated valves.

The USACE conducted assesment and found the pipeline to be safe , the Fish and Wildlife service also concluded that pipeline
 will have either "No Effect" or "May Affect, But Not Likely to Adversely Affect" on
listed species. 

Last but not least, right now the oil is shipped by trucks, which is one of least save and ecological solutions, so unless you want stop the crude production entirely, which, let's face it, is kind of hard sell for people who work there, it's better for the oil to be shipped by pipeline.

Anyway, the report goes into way more detail, you can find it here:

<TEXT> This is case study no. 50, done by Royal Commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse.
[Case study 50](http://www.childabuseroyalcommission.gov.au/case-study/261be84b-bec0-4440-b294-57d3e7de1234/case-study-50,-february-2017,-sydney)

Many other organisations (religious and secular) were investigated and others are going to be. 
Sadly (as far as I know) only Catholic church had comprehensive report done at the end. 
Others have only individual reports and related materials.

Some interesting data from the case study 50.

Overall proportion of priests who were alleged perpetrators
Priests overall  weighted average Percent

All Catholic Church authorities with priest members 7.0%

Diocesan Catholic Church authorities 7.9%

Religious Institutes with priest members 5.7%

Archdiocese/Diocese  weighted average Percent 

Archdiocese of Adelaide 2.4%

Diocese of Ballarat 8.7%

Catholic Archdiocese of Brisbane 9.3%

Diocese of Bunbury 7.8%

Catholic Archdiocese of CanberraGoulburn 8.4%

Diocese of Lismore 13.9%

Diocese of MaitlandNewcastle 7.9%

REPT.0011.001.0006

And finally 

Number of alleged perpetrators 
12. A total of 1,880 alleged perpetrators (diocesan and religious priests, religious brothers, religious
sisters, lay employees or volunteers) were identified in claims of child sexual abuse. 

13. Of the 1,880 alleged perpetrators identified: 
a. 693 were nonordained religious (37% of all known alleged perpetrators), being 597
religious brothers (32% of all known alleged perpetrators) and 96 religious sisters (5% of
all known alleged perpetrators)

b. 572 were priests (30% of all known alleged perpetrators), being 384 diocesan priests and
188 religious priests

c. 543 were lay people (29% of all known alleged perpetrators)

d. For 72 known alleged perpetrators (4%) the religious status was not known.


To reiterate: other organisations are investigated, including schools, prisons, Scouts, YMCA, medical personnel and many others. Please do not forget about these victims. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well you stated it wrong. 7% are probably molesters, not 80% like you implied right now, not even 20% like you stated.

In both cases you were incorrect and I wonder why are you so unwilling to admit that.
So I will ask you, did you read the report itself? Or are you just quoting the article?

Because if you did read that you would know you are wrong and you are probably graduate of "alternative facts" school of statistics.
And if you didn't read it I honestly do not understand why, if you are truly so interested in the matter I imagine you would spare 10 minutes of your time to read about the findings of the commission. 

Finally, I am deeply sorry that you interpreted my insistence on facts to be my acceptance of child molestation. I hope that you do understand that it was a wrong impression and I am sorry that my conduct caused you to adopt such belief.

<TEXT> Yeah but sadly data is the last thing that matters in these things.
People have tendency to simplify, it is much easier to just be outraged than actually try to understand the problem.

To make things worse church is treated as a single entity by most people, no matter where the priest is, where he works, what order is he part of or how the congregation looks like, all that will appear in the headline is Catholic church.

On the other hand when it comes to say, football club or school, there is much more nuance because not all schools or clubs are part of same organisation.

To sum it up: humans look for patterns, it's what they do, even if those patterns imaginary like face on mars or astrology, people cling to them because they make world easier to understand.
And in this case it's easier to say that Catholic Church is full of child molesters than to say that child molesters appear anywhere they can molest children and organisations involved tend to sweep things under rag. </TEXT>

<TEXT> West talks a lot but does way too little.

For example Libya, it's right across the sea from most developed nations on Earth, nations that helped depose local dictator, you would think that they would be interested in fostering local democracy, providing military, economical and political support so that the place didn't turn into another Syria.

Guess again. Right after Gaddafi died they turned their back to local problems. And then they started to wonder why are Libyans unable to stop migrants and are sailing en mass to Europe.

Sure they could step in and help, but soldiers could die, kids could get killed in misplaced strike and it would look bad in the press.
So they decide to do nothing, just send the locals some money and condemn the worst groups, but nothing substantial.

Make no mistake I do agree that Muslim nations should do more. But I also think that right now all west does is glorified PR move dedicated to one goal: improving ratings. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most don't care about it, some oppose it on moral grounds.

Personally as a westerner I would prefer caning to long term prison for most offenders.

If you throw a guy in prison for a decade all you accomplish is him becoming even worse criminal. He does not contribute to society in any way while imprisoned, he does not reform and it certainly does not help the victim.
Usually he loses his family and home not to mention his job.

On the other hand if you beat him up in public he will remember it for rest of his life and can return to his previous life without delay.
His family will not abandon him and he actually has a chance of becoming productive citizen.

So all things considered, I would support such punishment for some criminals.

<TEXT> I think that we should all focus on what is truly important, crime was committed, suspect was detained, wounded are being treated, people showed compassion.

All in all, despite the shooting, despite the vitriol we should all find comfort in the fact that system still works.

And furthermore I would like to remind everyone that no matter who is the attacker and who is attacked the state should always act in same way. 
I am no supporter of rampant immigration (I am Czech not American), I do believe Islamism is a threat the western politicians underestimate but I also believe that fearmongering and decisions based on feelings rather than facts are the answer. 

I do not think that Trump will help the situation with what he is doing and I do not believe he has best interests of Americans in mind. But I do not think that Merkel has the right answers either.

What I do think however is that we must take violence as the very last option and that crimes, no matter the perpetrator, must be prevented or failing that punished.

And I think it's a shame that people prefer their narrative to justice.
That goes to all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually decentralizing it would be the worst decision possible.

You see, local authorities, councils and such, are elected and beholden to very small selection of the public. Most people don't vote in elections and even less people vote in municipal elections, so you mostly end up with town being controlled by very small group of dedicated voters.

Accidentally, people who are dedicated to voting are often also very, shall we say, convinced that their views are right. After all they walked all the way to booths to prove it.

And so, local authorities are inclined to follow wishes of these narrow groups rather than to do what is actually good for the children or what is even sensible.

If you decentralize education you put the authority over curriculum , teachers ,and ultimately, pupils, into hands of the most radical and convinced elements of the communities in question.

If, on the other hand, you centralize the decision and policy making, you ensure that all the varied groups with their interests and opinions are represented and you prevent the most radical of them from dictating the policy.

To put it into layman terms, the more idiots are yelling at each other, the less they yell at reasonable people. And the reasonable people have time to actually work. </TEXT>

Because lets face it, everyone likes babies and everyone wants to protect them. 

Fetuses are sort of babies, so all you need are few lies to turn abortions from painful and mostly last resort procedure to billion dollar business and "life style".

If Republicans really cared about "life" they would support universal health-care, stricter pollution standards and sexual education.

But all they care about are votes and abortions are issue that requires almost zero effort to get votes from. 
You don't need policy, funding, knowledge or research.

All you need is to denounce "those baby killing abortionists" and cut funding to couple of projects. And boom, instant votes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry Sturgeon, your party had a chance and you blew it.

I am all for self determination but everyone knew it was once a generation type of referendum, you gave it all you had and it was not enough. I would be sorry but the extend of lies and misinformation perpetrated by your side of the issue is almost the same as that of the brexiteers, so I'm not sorry.

Now your finances are in shambles and dreams of becoming another Norway in ashes. 

So how about you do something for your people and instead help negotiate some reasonable compromise. Or is that a dirty word. </TEXT>

Not in a way of him implementing proper policies, no. But by literally crushing the status quo in DC. Tearing GOP apart from within, forcing Democrats to adapt after failing in elections.

<TEXT> That is kind of political minefield I'm afraid, especially for Swedes with their heavy handed PC culture.

On one hand you risk pissing off people who will gleefully chop your head off, on the other hand if you omit the religious dimension you are left with, not that much really.

For example say that the Paradox would implement similar events like Catholics have now for Muslims, the doctrine conflicts, the reformation (Ibadi, Sikhs), nations implementing their own versions of rites like Albania did or competing for access to Mecca.

Those are all easy to do but you run at real risk of pissing people off. People who are not above killing because of few pictures.


I don't think the Paradox staff/management is willing to take that risk. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually I did run some tests. If Ming gets development boost in key provinces, like those producing porcelain, tea or silk, the rebellions are not so devastating because loosing few provinces is not a terrible hit to manpower and income.

Even better is the fact that if mingsplosion does happen the new states have more money to build armies and to reunify the empire.

So yes, development boost does help. But it would have to be more like 100-200 development for it to work.

Still pretty historical. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The thing is that we who have autism/aspergers have to learn that the hard way. Often we just have to figure things out because asking about this freaks people out. 

To make things worse lot of us pick wrong "weather" topics because we can not fathom why others wouldn't find them interesting.
For example trains, precambrian fauna or Starfleet organisation system.

But people don't tell us it bores them until they are already pissed, because they want to be polite. They just suggest or imply, which is not enough for someone like me, mostly. 

Anyway to make it short: Stuff about socialization that most people get naturally we have to learn as they would learn to read or, in some cases, solve systems of linear equations.  </TEXT>

For decades he saw what are humans capable of when they "live without limits" he saw that no matter what they never change.

<TEXT> I know about these cases and I know they were real. I just find this one very strange because the way victim behaves.

One thing is being afraid of your captor, I get that. But at the same time writing book about it? And proclaiming publicly what happened and what your and his name is?

That does not fit the profile of a victim too scared to press charges.

Again I do thing that British police behaved/behaves reprehensibly when it comes to rapes and other crimes committed by Muslims.
And yes, I do believe that there are more scandals like Rotherham coming. 

But this one case seems very odd to me and looks more like a hoax than a genuine case of sex slavery. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, but still better than Friesland or Provence.

The biggest problem with trade leagues is how limited they are.
At best they have 6 members before they stop growing, the pool of OPMs to choose from is also pretty small. 

For example, when playing as Ragusa one gets request to join from Memmingen or Ansbach, both of which are completely irrelevant to Ragusas trade nodes.

The north is even worse somehow. The Baltic falls to the Poland/Muscovy in less than five decades, most of the time anyway.
And if that was not enough there is constant threat of Netherlands minors annexing each other or being taken over by Burgundy/France.

If other states than just OPMs could join the problem would be solved, it would also help if the bonuses were greater or if vassals could join the leagues. But sadly Paradox just wants to buff kebab and baguette.  </TEXT>

As for Austria, it is in the game files but only after the first start date, making it pretty much useless.

I made myself a mod putting the Ladislaus Posthumus in charge of rump Austria, with Bohemia and Hungary in PU, while his uncle rules rest of Hapsburg lands as emperor. 

It really changed balance of power, when Ladislaus survived the Styria got ripped apart with large part going to Bavaria/Venice.
Austria/Hungary/Bohemia became powerhouse of the empire and essentially took over Poland/Northern Balkans. 

It was fun.  </TEXT>

Wiki is a good starting point.
As for Sweden specifically https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt

Edit:To clarify. The witch trials were very rare until the reformation and early modern era. 
During medieval times the Church mostly considered witchcraft to be a superstition and not worthy of investigation. Heretics were a different matter.

The rulings of Council of Frankfurt and Council of Paderborn are especially interesting. As well as opinions of Church Father St. Augustine and Pope Gregory VII. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No that was UN, Arabs didn't accept that ruling and were very clear that they don't want any kind of Jewish state to exist. Preferably no Jews at all but if there are to be Jews they should be ruled by Arabs.

BTW that proposal didn't give Jews all the land they have now.

UN did it anyway and told Jews that if they want the country they have to deal with Arabs themselves. Arabs started war with stated goal of pushing Jews into the sea.

They lost. And Israelis took some of their land.
Arabs didn't like that so they attacked again few years later. 
And lost again and Israelis took more of their land. 
And so on and so on.
Most of the time the Israelis were heavily outnumbered and outgunned, not to mention without any help from Europe.

Over time the Arabs mostly decided to let it go, except for Hammas and Fatah who still want to kill all the Jews and "Reclaim Palestine".
Arabs who live in Israel and have citizenship mostly don't care.

The territory used to be administered by UK so thats where some of the confusion comes from.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Genetic diseases are, almost without exception, incurable. Once you have them they are with you for life and that life can be very short and painful because of them.

Unfortunately even if you yourself don't show any symptoms you can pass it to your children, only option, until now, was to get checked, which is not cheap, and if you are positive not have any children.

In this case the problem is in Mitochondrial DNA. 
You see inside all of our cells are these incredibly small things called mitochondria. Very long time ago they were bacteria but our very distant ancestors (Billions of years ago), absorbed them. Since then we and all other animals and many other organisms use them as powerplants. We provide protection and food, and they convert the food into energy.

Mitochondria have, over time, lost most of their DNA. They didn't need it since we took care of most of what it was responsible for.
But some of it is still left. If it is damaged you can suffer from some pretty horrifying stuff. And in worst case you can die, young and in lots of pain.

Now the mitochondria are passed from mother, they are present in every unfertilized egg. 

This technology allows us to take out the defective mitochondria and replace them with functional ones. The child has all the characteristics of its mother, all of that is encoded in nucleus of the egg which is NOT changed at all during the procedure.
Only thing that it takes from the donor is functional metabolism.

Now here come the awesome part, since mitochondria are passed from mother to child we can, over time, essentially wipe out ALL mitochondrial diseases just by performing mitochondrial donations on sick human eggs.

This technology was already tested in USA several years ago and it's completely safe. The children are healthy and according to all data show no signs of abnormalities. Unfortunately due to luddite scaremongering the US government decided against allowing the technology, despite being advised to allow it by its own agencies and experts.

And thus children kept on dying, in pain, couples experienced multiple stillbirths, women were abandoned by husbands and slipped into depression. All because people were afraid of something that is impossible.

<TEXT> I have been pondering this for some time and I wanted to know others opinions about this.

The control problem is, in a way, something humanity already encountered. After all, society is composed of individuals with conflicting goals and yet we do not, for most of the time, slaughter each other for food.

Yes there are laws, police, army etc. but when you think about it, unless people get desperate we don't need them that much.
Because, in a way, most of us have our own inner police officer who watches everything we do. 
Some call it conscience, you could also consider it to be amalgam of social norms and morality.

What I mean to say is, the best way to control AI might be the AI itself. If we could teach AI to be moral and to have sort of conscience, we could minimize the chance of it hurting us.

Of course it wouldn't be sure thing, morality does not have just the good side after all. But it would be better than leaving the responsibility to humans, who, after all, are proven to be unreliable.

What do you think?

With coalitions turned on player has one more ticker to worry about, most of the time you don't have to care for it, but take a Kingdom William the Conqueror style and suddenly you are black sheep of the Christendom. 

It makes wars into a minefield because the calculation is more or less hidden. Sooner or later you will have to throw away your claims and you can forget about being next Genghis Khan or Justinian.

All and all it was a useless feature and a bad idea, not to mention the fact that it's very ahistorical. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Essentially if you conquer too much land other rulers will band against you, as other countries would in EU4. Unfortunately they do so without regard for your CB, their religion, mutual relationships or distance.

Therefor if you, for example, conquered entire Egypt as a Catholic ruler you would face coalition of Caliph, Pope, Roman Emperor and bunch of others. 

They later nerfed that somewhat, but the feature was so unpopular that they made it optional.
That is you can disable it if you don't like it and get the achievements anyway. They even admitted that it was not exactly a good idea, and by making it optional they more or less consigned it to oblivion.

<TEXT> Copy of my post from /r/eu4:

Sorry but this feels wrong on several levels. 

1. Since forever have been players asking for more diversity, for the game to be about more than just Western Europe. This update does the exact opposite. The ages are even named after events that primarily concerned western Europe and its colonies.

2. The abilities for specific nations are going to railroad the game even more than it is. Time to prepare for more Blue Blobs, giant Kebabs and Iberian Americas. 
Am I seriously the only person around who doesn't want every game to turn out the same? I get it realism is cool, but these buffs make the game arguably less realistic. There is difference between realism and historic outcome.

3. The goals seem like really unimaginative and boring. Everyone gets the same ones it seems and again they seem custom made for traditional "easy" nations like Portugal, Castille, Ottomans and France. These nations didn't further buffs since three expansions ago, at very least.

4. The golden age mechanic is so gamey that it makes me laugh. Magic button that lowers cost of all your stuff for next 50 years, that you can use only once? Seriously?

Sorry this seems like a worst patch in long while. And arguably waste of developers time. I wouldn't be surprised if it ended up like coalition feature in CKII. </TEXT>

It's something like Czech ebay, the link will take you to section dedicated to old Czechoslovak computers.
The Didactic computers are the most common, followed by PMDs.
Sadly it's kind of hard to get PMD power source but you can make one your self if you look up the specs.

There is also a Polish version of Aukro if you are interested [http://allegro.pl/stare-komputery-pozostale-77927](http://allegro.pl/stare-komputery-pozostale-77927) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Asylums are not a bad idea. With modern methods they can be used to help people while still being more cost-effective and reliable.

Unfortunately there is a "collateral damage", meaning, patients who get worse due to mistreatment, isolation from outside society or influence from other patients. I have seen some relatively functional individuals get completely deranged in record time, after about a month in an institution. 

On the other hand I know about many people who got better and are now reintegrated into society, they now have jobs, home, even started families. Not just addicts, anorexic and suicidal people, but even guys you would run from if you have seen them before, and for a good reason.

However in some cases only the most radical solutions can help.
For example, in my country the most dangerous sexual deviants, I'm talking murderous psychos, serial pedophile rapists etc., get a choice if they want to be interred for life or submit to chemical or mechanical castration and a long treatment with eventual chance of release into society. 

Many have taken that path. But it's very rare since they have to be proven capable of understanding their situation and commission of doctors have to believe it can actually help.  </TEXT>

Because those I met, almost completely secular expats btw, told me the whole self-reliance/distance from sinful outside deal. 
Which is btw supported by other sources such as wiki.

Edit: One more thing. I completely agree that religion should not be exempt from criticism. In fact, criticism of religion is how Anabaptist/Mennonites/Amish got started, well it's how all religions got started.
Also I do agree that approach to technology Amish took does NOT make much sense.

<TEXT> Yes it was Roman because it claimed heritage of Roman empire. Roman empire which, btw, was also multilingual, multiethnic and for most of its history didn't have Rome as capital.

Yes it was an empire because there is no list of requirements a state must fulfill in order to be an empire. After all Haiti was and empire, Brazil was an empire and France was an empire and no one questions names of those states.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good idea, but there are several problems.

1. European heavy industry almost all privatized. You would have to pressure owners to switch to unprofitable goods or you would have to heavily subsidize the goods you want to produce.

2. Unlike in China, the heavy industry in Europe is heavily regulated. Not just environmentally speaking but also regarding workers rights, safety, community responsibility etc. Because of that our industry can hardly compete on costs with foreign imports. 

Unless strict tariffs were implemented. But that would go against free trade policies that Merkel and EU centrists traditionally push for. Not to mention the fact that it would hit the middle and upper class, you know, the people the politicians are closest to.

3. European heavy industry is in decline for last two decades. At very least relative to the rest of the world and probably even in total output. Numerous factories were shut down and torn down. Workers moved into different jobs, others emigrated and many retired. 
Increasing industrial capacity would not be easy.

4. Last but not least. In short term this policy would be very painful. And elections are coming up in Germany and France, not to mention referendum in Italy. Therefore it would be, to say at least, bold to pursue a policy that will cause discontent among electorate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because NASA is conservative as hell. 

And it has to be. It's budget is so small, its mission so bloated and its direction so politicized that any misstep can have catastrophic implications for next decade. 

That's why NASA nixes the most innovative proposals and sticks to same approach since the 70s.

For example, inflatable modules for space stations.
Cheaper, lighter, easy to manufacture and replace, oh and also from the 60s. The BEAM module attached to ISS right now is using materials known since 70s and module several times larger (TransHab) was supposed to be part of ISS from the start.

Until it got cut by Congress, BTW both parties sponsored the bill and both parties voted for it.

Edit: Same goes for non-chemical propulsion and non-solar energy sources. First US nuclear reactor in space was launched in 1965, and it was also the last. Imagine the missions that would be possible without such stringent energy constraints we have today. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can I just throw this out in the open?

It's too late. None of us, including president of USA can stop the global warming now. Even if USA had freaking Al Gore as president there would be no way to stop this.

Sure developed world can decrease emissions, but our emissions are no longer the bulk of the problem. The real big deal is that the rest of the world wants to live as we do.

And who could blame them? 
If you think that China, India, Nigeria or Indonesia will put their economies on the sacrificial altar of humanity you are badly mistaken. 
Sure, should they do it the things will work out eventually. But their governments would risk revolutions, civil wars and other stuff in the process. The train is just going too fast now for them to jump out.

So lets pull your collective heads out of your collective asses and stop pretending you can stop this shit. The ecosystem IS FUCKED. 
That's it, baring miracle, there is NO WAY to fix it just by lowering emissions.

We need to get radical. The climate won't fix itself just by us stopping fucking with it. 

No WE FUCKED IT UP, so WE MUST FIX IT. 
Fertilize oceans with iron, genetically engineer new plants to fix more carbon, splice corals to grow faster and to be more resilient. 
Fill depressions in Sahara and Australia with sea water to increase cloud cover.

Build desalination plants and dykes around coastal cities, prepare resettlement of coastal populations. 

Build more nuclear power plants, so what if some reactors melt down. If ten Chernobyls are price we have to pay for our survival as a species then SO BE IT.

TLDR: LETS SCIENCE THE SHIT OUT OF GLOBAL WARMING. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was Teutoburg forest level of bad decision. 
Taking third of your forces into enemy territory, while rest of your forces is already spread VERY thin and when the best you can expect is some degree of information on what is going on and MAYBE some reduction of the impossible threat IS VERY STUPID.

Lets consider the best case scenario.
Watch finds out how many wildlings/undead there are and figure out how to kill the walkers. Great Job.
Well no. Not only would watch considerably reduce its stocks of food, horse feed etc., it would also reveal its weakness to wildlings and the Walkers. 

To make matters worse they left their rear unguarded. The Castle Black was essentially empty, if even a very small force attacked while they were on their scouting mission they would lose the Castle Black and the Wall itself.

But that is not the only problem. The watch had about 1000 men at the start of the winter. A pathetic number for the task they were given. Mormont risked reducing that number even further. And don't forget that he took the very best he had at the time. Each man lost at that point is a considerable loss for the Watch. 

Last but not least, Mormont took majority of experienced officers with him, even if just few of them died the Watch would be decapitated. Which eventually happened.

TLDR: Mormont risked everything for very little possible gain. A good commander plans for the worst. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That is nice philosophy but not a good foreign policy. Not intervening would be great if Europe was in middle of ocean and we lived in age before transoceanic trade. But alas that is not the case.

Today Europe is highly dependent on foreign trade, most of our economy is built around either exporting or importing things outside of EU. Therefore ignoring everything outside EU could, very well, economic ruin.  

For example Somali pirates operate well outside EU, and yet they threaten EU citizens and trade routes we need for our countries to function. Would you let them walk free? Let Americans to do the job? Or maybe its time for underfunded and corruption ridden local armies to handle it.
Or we could pull our own weight and do it ourselves. What do you think is best?

Another thing is international terrorism. Say you have situation like today in Iraq, Syria and Libya. Genocidal organisation is butchering local ethnic and religious minorities, sending millions at our doorstep. The very same organisation has stated goal to kill us all if we don't follow their ways, and they have already proven they mean it. 

Local government is on verge of collapse. Time is of the essence. Do you let them fall? It is outside of EU borders. They are not members why should you care? Maybe because it can be your problem tomorrow.

You see it is not cut and dry. Interventions are not a dirty word. And often they are only way. </TEXT>

You know that is actually a good thing. If later your government decides to actually take care of its people, instead of rapists, terrorists and religious nuts, they can revoke their citizenship without breaking international law and then deport them. In many ways it makes things easier because Muslims holding dual citizenship are most likely to be disloyal or dangerous. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It should not. I hate to say this but Paradox games are NOT historical simulations. They are meant to be reasonably realistic, but buffing Ottomans every patch is NOT realistic. It DOES lead to realistic outcome but in a realistic way.

For example if Ottomans in 1600 got all the land they historically had, cores and all, by an event. It would be realistic outcome but it would be essentially cheating. Just like this is.

Anyway, Paradox should not simulate expansion of Ottomans, Spanish, French etc. they should simulate general trends and key events. But they should not force the game in one direction. Hell instead of going west Ottomans could go and conquer India, Muscovy could fall to Golden Horde and Novgorod, England could win the 100 year war. 

History was often at edge of knife and lots of stuff was possible. In rest of EU4 weird outcomes are possible should happen.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Apart from historical claims there is continuity of administration. Current Catholic church is largely modeled after imperial institutions, after all even Pope has title Pontifex Maximus that once belonged to Roman high priest/emperor, and [Roman Curia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Curia) which governs church to this day is essentially continuation of the imperial bureaucracy. 

In many cases the church was only institution left when Empire fell apart. The priests were often literate and respected, and thus they became administrators of what was left of old imperial cities like Cologne, Trier, Augsburg, Aquileia and even Rome. 

Eventually the bishops became rulers and church turned into essentially secular power where religion often played second fiddle. 
Legacy of this we carry to this day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ottomans, France is manageable, Spain fragile, Austria easy to bait into proxy wars, Ming has mandate of heaven, Poland is to reliant on Lithuania, Muscovy lacks development, England/GB is over-relying on navy and Brandenburg/Prussia is contained by HRE.

But Ottomans have no easy counter, no strategy that can be applied without relying on luck. When it comes to them there are only two ways.

1. Spend ENTIRE first century focusing just on them until they are gone.

2. Spend ENTIRE last century focusing just on them until they are gone.

Fighting them in midgame borders on masochism, doable but so unenjoyable and stressful that I rather focus on ANYTHING else.

And to add insult to injury those guys are given ahistorical buffs on scale that just does not make sense. I get it Paradox, you want to put history on tracks. 
But that's not how history works. In real life one battle can cripple an empire for century, arbitrarily buffing a nation so that it has advantage it never had does NOT add to the fun.

It's just that I feel that your government has gone way overboard with a lot of policies and fails to understand the ramifications of them. And, like it or not, German and French government policies are effectively EU policies. How many times in last few years have you seen Juncker when it came to important Union business and how many times have you seen Merkel or Holland.

<TEXT> To those saying that we should just buy products of higher quality: THERE ARE NONE. 

Yep, seriously. All our manufacturers are either out of business or owned by foreigners.  And we want to buy stuff of the same quality you have, we have to pay more than you do. Yeah that's right, we have less money and if we want same services we have to pay more.

And our government can't do a dick about it, because we have free movement of goods, capital, people and services in EU. So there goes that. And there is almost zero chance for new manufacturers to arise at home, because spoiler alert, we have less money to start businesses and our experts are leaving for greener pastures.

But we do get those EU handouts in form of infrastructure projects, so there's that.   </TEXT>

The HR people do. The interview itself can be conducted with actual developer, but quite often the candidates are of poor quality because of the first selection round. 

And in many companies (my last workplace for example) there is also a time factor. 
If you don't fill the open position in time, someone in the management few levels above you can see that position as wasteful expense and decide to cut it.

So eventually you have to settle for sub-par candidate that was selected by you, but from options provided to you by HR.  </TEXT>

Not only is this provably not true, if embraced it brings series of questions which lead to very dark places.

If advance is inevitable than you need to find reason why societies develop at different rates and in different ways, in other words, you need to account why the development seems to slow down sometimes.

<TEXT> Consider following: when German troops arrived in Ukraine they were hailed as heroes, only for locals to be slaughtered. IF, and I hate this kind of WHAT IF history, that didn't happen how many volunteers would Wehrmacht have from local population? Stalin and communists in general were hated by much of the USSRs population.

Next you have the death camps, ghettos, concentration camps etc. not only these tied valuable manpower, guards that could have been deployed at front, they also cost Germany many of its best scientists, engineers, doctors, craftsmen, not to mention healthy young man who could fight. 

And Jewish people were very loyal to Germany, before Nazis decided to slaughter them. 

Last but not least. The holocaust ,or rather the Nazi policies towards conquered people, were crucial rallying cry for world public. Lots of people were quite apathetic before WWII, especially in France, Britain and most of all USA. 
The only reason why many of them decided to support the war effort was the fact that Nazis were complete monsters. 
And even then there were defeatists who wanted to sue peace and pacifists that would happily let Jews, Roma, homosexuals, Slavs and countless others get slaughtered just to stay in their ivory tower. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah but sadly that is a nationalism issue. Try telling Slovaks that their language and ours is the same or Czechs that our language and Slovaks is the same and you will be in for a nasty surprise.


Personally I think we were better of in union with Austria, most of us spoke German anyway, we had our national organisations like National Theater, and we even had representation in Vienna. 
Vienna had second biggest Czech population after Prague for crying out loud, to this day there are more people with my name in Austria than in Czech Republic.

Right now we are basically non-entities. Austria, CR, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, we are so small that we can be essentially bought, our governments have no pull in EU or UN and as far as markets are concerned we are appendages of Germany. </TEXT>

Anyway, point is that Boris Johnsons career is now pretty much over. The very same people that loved him will now only see him when he talks with some foreigner they probably don't like. He can not gather support in home because he is almost always on some diplomatic mission, his successes (if he has any) will hardly impact Britons and if they do PM can get credit. Baring a miracle (which I hope will not come) he is politically dead. </TEXT>

Take my country for example, we have lots of Ukranians and Serbs working construction jobs, some people bitch about them taking those jobs from us, yet at the same time our trade schools have bunch of empty places and half of the Czech workers I see on construction sites are guys int their late fifties.

So its mostly supply and demand problem. There is not enough Czechs to fill the available positions, so they are given to immigrants.  </TEXT>

Now I know how to do this, defining elements is easy, making appropriate XML is simple and HTML documentations is primitive, but I can not fathom how to do it without my brain pouring out of my ears from boredom.

I mean, how can I even come up with so many elements anyway? 
Is there anyway to deal with this, beyond making a database of something like Solar system or ASOIAF characters?

Is there any way to make this interesting? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, the year is 1636, I am playing as Austria and I have been eagerly waiting for religious peace. The thing is something went wrong. The leagues just didn't fire at all. All my electors stayed catholic, except for Brandenburg with which I had excellent relations.
Later on Pomerania annexed Brandenburg and I gave the electorate to Pope. That was in 1562 or so.

The thing is, without peace or catholic dominance I can not convert princes to Catholicism. And so the IA is taking massive hit every month despite having 52 princes.

Is this a bug or do I have to wait for a while? </TEXT>

So can we trust them? The first thing his mother does when she sees him is that she tries to kill him. I mean he IS a monster but that seems pretty cold. It almost seems like if she was trying to stop him from talking.  </TEXT>

But thing is, I can't get my Liberty Desire up, Savoy is just too strong and even if I get into near bankruptcy, the culture bonus pretty much cancels it out.
After that they start to annex me.

So the question is: Does anyone have any ideas, how to get Montferrat out of Savoyard overlordship? </TEXT>

<TEXT> My favorites include GitS, PsychoPass, Knights of Sidonia, Tokyo Ghoul, Hellsing and Blood+.

I would prefer Science fiction but fantasy, supernatural or mix would work as well. Cyberpunk would be best since I really enjoyed GitS.

<TEXT> What it says.

Right now I'm working on certain Neural network project, sort of similar to Creatures in intention (artificial life) if not in scope (not really a game).

I realized how inadequate traditional neural networks are for the task. So I came here to ask.
Are there any detailed resources or documentation on Norn brains?
I figured if anyone you guys should know. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Fallout 4 Story - Can we hope? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-05 16:20:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I think I'll get million down votes but here it comes.
Story of Fallout 3 sucked, it sucked big time.
I'm not saying that the world was not amazing but nonetheless the story sucked. 

Just remember: Little Lamplight with annoying brats you couldn't kill, that could miraculously procreate before puberty, room with so much radiation that neither super mutant, ghoul or robot could enter it, Threedog the Jar-Jar of the wastelaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand, dozens of unkillable characters, epic battle where Liberty prime did all the work etc.

So the question is: Is there any hope that we will get better story this time? 

Does anyone know who's writing it and if that person has any experience at all? </TEXT>

<TITLE> (Spoilers ALL) Possible twist of Danys story line </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-23 20:37:29 </DATE>

<TEXT> Tattered prince is a very mysterious figure. Valyrian not sharing his name, with no banner, who refused title of Prince of Pentos and instead founded a mercenary band.
What if he is the last Blackfyre?

In the books, Selmy sends envoys to negotiate with him while Dany is riding away on white mare and Drogon. Lets assume that he accepts the offer and switches sides.
This could lead to first peaceful meeting between two branches of house Targaryen in a century. 

Or not...

*The Tattered prince thrust his sword into her chest. Almost gently he pulled he towards himself and whispered in her ear. "The Blackfyres send their regards."* </TEXT>

<TITLE> Single variable calculus in one shortened semester. What to do with it? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-25 19:23:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> What it says in the title.
My college, Czech university of Life sciences, had decided that since students visiting it are second rate anyway there is no reason to waste more time on them then necessary.
So instead of year worth of calculus we have to do with one 12 week semester and are expected to have same results.

A the beginning I knew it was going to be tough but I saw at least some hope. One flu later and its pretty much hopeless.

The first exams are in a week so it's not looking good.
And lets be honest I am not a very good student, if I was I would be going to proper technical school and not what is basically community college.

To make it short. Is there any chance for me to learn calculus properly in time for exams? I can handle derivations, most indefinite and definite integrals but I have almost no knowledge of differential equations.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Reasons you suck speech... for the Doctor </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-24 12:52:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The Doctor gives plenty of speeches in the series, describing the faults of his enemies, often in such detail that even most terrifying creature reacts to it.
But it occurred to me that no one ever gives such speech to Doctor himself, well except for Davros but he went light on him.

So after a little consideration I decided to write this speech the Doctor receives in my head-fanfic.

BTW I still love the show.


-----------------------------------------


When I first learned about you I feared you. A man that can topple empires and save worlds with his wit alone. A man that confronted greatest dangers this universe possess and lived to tell about it.
There is nothing wrong about fearing such creature.

Later I begun to admire you. A man of such integrity that he refused power when offered, a man who stood when everyone else fled or fell to insanity. Then I began to loath you...

You call yourself The Doctor, you claim to be healer of all wrongs, saver of sick and protector of weak. But it is all a lie.
You are a doctor who loves bacteria more  than patients, you are a healer afraid of scalpel, a protector so afraid to use his strength that he fails time and time again to protect those he promised to.

You hide behind your morality and always take the easy way out, rather than to stain you hands with blood you walk away from bleeding, rather than to hear patient scream you do not amputate, rather than to kill germs you let the sepsis set in.

Daleks killed immeasurable trillions, Cybermen turned entire galaxies into abominations, Weeping angels sucked life out of solar systems worth of beings. You have and had power to stop it, to make it never happen in first place but you did not. And why?

Because you are coward, you are so afraid of not not being paragon of virtue that you forgot what being a doctor actually means. 

You are not doctor you are a charlatan offering snake oil and cheap anesthetic. How many billions have died because of your fake mercy? How many planets burned so that you wouldn't have to stain your pretty clothes? Every time you think you solved a crises you are just postponing it. And so time and time again you have stop the same menace, the same disease and yet even that is a lie. Earth may be save but what about other worlds, prison camps are filled, stars extinguished and you can stop it but you don't because that would mean that you can no longer stand on pedestal above the rest of us.  

You are not a doctor, but I am. And today I'm going to stain my hands with blood of billions to save trillions, so that you could live an easy life.


*I can't let you do that.*


Oh, my dear Doctor... Do you really think I would talk to you all this time if there was even minimal chance of you stopping me?

It is already done. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Are Asari the baddies? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-06 20:01:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> What it says on tin. Are Asari the real villains of Mass Effect?

We know that they have the most prominent place in galactic society, they basically control culture, politics and biotic related technology in Citadel space. They had access to Protean beacon yet they violated their own rules and didn't share it with others. Instead they used it to boost their own species at expense of everyone else.

Another thing of note is how is Citadel space stagnant. Have you noticed that even carrier is considered amazing innovation, that all research related to transhumanism, both genetic and cybernetic, is curbstomped by regulation, red tape and even outright banned?

Yet this very research would be of immense benefit in war against the Reapers. Imagine if we could field millions of Shepards to battlefields across galaxy, or if we could send thousands of EDI equipped dreadnoughts to fight reaper fleets. Or if everyone was powerful biotic like Jack?

When you think about it the Asari rarely act in other species interest, in fact most of their policies are meant to enforce their hegemony. Restrictions on genetic engineering mean that everyone else ages faster then them and that no one has as good biotics as them. Restrictions on AI and cybernetics mean that they have advantage in field of diplomacy.


In fact you know who benefits more then anyone from Asari interference? Reapers...

We know Proteans helped Asari a lot, however then there was a large window when reapers could mingle with them freely.
