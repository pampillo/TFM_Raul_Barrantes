<TEXT> I usually just eyeball it on Strats/Teles, it really has come from years of trial and error. That's the fun thing about bolt-on guitars, unless you wrench the screws too much, you really can't hurt them. I've taken necks off, shimmed them, taken neck off, re-shim, etc. till it's right.

One tip, instead of restringing every time, I take a Capo or Gaff tape an place on the first fret to hold the strings on (after slacking them of course). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm more of a technician than a player, but I found the best way to get better is to play in a band. That could be just jamming with friends or actually playing shows. Playing with others (even those better than you) will up your game.

Also, if just starting out I think a lot of bands rehearse too much trying to make it perfect before playing a show. I say learn the songs to the best of your ability then play a show, might not be the best, but it will get better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have always been a 'maker' since I was a kid, from skateboards to art to furniture. So when trying to transition from touring back to a semi-retired home life I thought about either building guitars or amps or pedals. I had already done pedalboards as a business in the 90's and early 2000's so I wanted to do something different.

My partner Ossie went to college for Electronics Engineering, a more specialized EE, but that was a while ago and may not be applicable to school these days. Most of the great amp builders I know started as repair guys and thats where their knowledge stems from. So if you are interested in amp building I'd suggest trying to apprentice under a skilled amp tech. Also building amp kits and modding amps from schematics on the internet can be helpful, but also dangerous as voltages inside most tube amps run 300+VDC and can kill you. I like learning from someone in person, who can tell me what to do and not do. </TEXT>

As far as local band gigs go, one of the main things when guitar teching is to try and make the gear as bullet proof as possible BEFORE the gig. Also, bring a spare guitar if possible, some spare cables, strings, picks, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep, still answering questions. I'm gonna leave this AMA open for at least another day to try and answer as many as possible.

OK, to answer yours:

1. I've used Meguiars http://www.meguiars.com/ products over the years to remove scratches with some success. Since most guitars are painted with paint similar to cars. If you have a automotive paint store or high end detail place where you live, ask those guys what they might recommend, they are a wealth of knowledge usually.

2. I've never prepared a guitar specifically to withstand rain or sand. Most guitars are pretty good at combatting it on their own, and when rain has happened on an outdoor show, I've never had a guitar go down due to weather. I do make sure the guitars are dried off as much as possible before putting them away for the night. Repairs get done at the next show if needed, new pickups, output jack, etc. I have had to sweat-proof wireless packs over the years, as some guys will sweat so much the packs go out during the shows. Usually this means wrapping the pack in plastic wrap or putting it in a condom to keep it as dry as possible.

3. I haven't played a ton of the inexpensive stuff, but I did buy a J Mascis Squier Jazzmaster last year and it is one of the better playing guitars I've come across and I have left it completely stock. In fact it has been my main guitar lately and I have plenty of vintage and higher-end guitars. Over the years I have played a few of the LTD, Epiphone, etc. offering and usually find them to be pretty good as well. YMMV and if you have access to a large guitar shop, play as many models/manufacturers as you can and find what fits your playing and budget.

4. I can't really say specifically how the Korean manufacturers are doing. My JM was made in China I believe and the neck is perfect. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Session work is tough, it's not what you know but who you know.

As far as tech jobs, you basically just have to work your way up the ladder. Find a smaller band, start touring with them then make contacts with bigger acts and try to get hired on. There is no shortcut.

An English lighting guy once told me "It's the hardest job to get into , but it's even harder to get out of". Very true as guitar tech skills don't really translate to work at home unless you want to be a luthier or repair man.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I worked in a couple of music stores and also was in a regional touring band myself, that morphed into teching for some friends bands. Some of those bands got signed to major labels in the early 90's, so we all jumped in a van and toured the US and eventually Europe.

I had a couple of friends who were roadies (techs) for bigger bands such as Pearl Jam and Rage Against the Machine, and eventually my name got given to some production manager and I got a call and ended up on my first tour bus. From there, since this business is all word of mouth, you work for the opening band, meet the guys in the headliner's crew, do a good job, make contacts, get a call from one of those contacts for another gig, rinse, repeat ;)

I was actually semi-retired when I got called for Aerosmith in 2002. I turned it down, then called my wife , she said "Call them back"... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi. At some point probably, but these tube guitar amps have been around for 60+ years and most are still going strong. I'm sure software will have it's place especially with younger more tech savvy players and I'm not against it. But for a guitar player there is nothing like standing in front of a cranked amp, nothing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 60 cycle hum or a ground loop usually has nothing to do with the actually power supply/distibution, but with signal grounds. I use a transformer (like an Ebtech Hum Eliminator) to isolate those signal grounds, I never lift the AC ground on one of the amps to do this, this can be dangerous and risk a nice shock. 

Assembling a noiseless signal path has a lot of factors, but using quality signal cables is a good start. If using a lot of pedals then an isolated power supply is also a good idea. Something people seem to forget that there are a lot of solder joints between your guitar and your speaker, each one of those connections can add noise.

As an aside to your question, if you do have a noise or ground loop problem troubleshoot it from one end to the other to find the culprit. Start with Guitar into amp, then guitar into pedal 1  into amp, then guitar into pedal 1 into pedal 2 into amps, etc. Don't just start unplugging things randomly and expect to find the problem (not saying you do this, but I've seen it done). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also, artists rarely break strings, but it happens. In 9mos with AC/DC I only had one string break, and that was the first gig, and before I saw how hard Stevie hit the guitar. I looked for burrs in the saddles (and changed a few over the course of the tour) every time I changed strings. So don't be afraid, and have a backup if possible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good question. My rule of thumb is I change strings when they need changing. What I mean by that is most guitars don't need new strings every gig, new strings are usually a little too bright for my tastes and sound better the second gig after being played a few songs. Every artist is different though, if someone has really corrosive sweat then they have to change strings more often. I normally change an artists 'main' guitar every gig and a backup (or backups) every few gigs depending on how much it is played. Also, when I change strings I look at the bridge and the nut carefully for burrs and sand those down and use something like Big Bends Nut Sauce on both saddle and nut.

Most guitars never need a refret unless the artist uses one guitar all night with large strings. Again, I go by a "when it needs it" philosophy and also "if it ain't broke, don't break it". No need to replace change something because you 'think' it's time. This goes for tubes as well, if your amp sounds great, don't re-tube. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not really. A lot of those overly complex rigs are built by the techs trying to make it so no one can run it so they have 'job security'. This never works out as everyone is replaceable.

My Green Day rig for Jason White was a complicated rig built by me due to the fact there was no other choice (I ran all his effects except Wah and Volume from offstage). Here's what was going on, the Green Day guys use three distinct electric sounds, 1. Clean, 2. Mid (somewhat lo-fi), and 3. Big (full on Marshall). Also with Jason we had an acoustic bridge on his 335's to do all the acoustic parts directly into a DI (down a TRS cable). So the problem was that we needed to go from Acoustic to Electric (any of the 3 sounds) and back in an instant. Originally in 2005 I had a sort of double A/B box that turned on the Acoustic while muting the electric or turned on the electric while muting the acoustic (all while keeping the signal paths separate so that the Acoustic could never run through the amps *major feedback*). In 2009 I rebuilt the rig using an RJM loop switcher and some Custom Audio Electronics stuff to do all the switching via MIDI foot control.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You hit the nail on the head, probably the weakest link in a rig is the instrument jack. It get's a lot of wear, I don't change a ton of them, but when one starts acting up, you better change it before it goes dead in the middle of a show.

Wireless is great and the only way to go in a large scale venue, arena or stadium, etc. Unless the artist rarely moves (singer for instance). For smaller gigs I prefer the sound of a cable as long as no one is tripping over it constantly. </TEXT>

Seriously, my one golden rule is if I come into a gig and the rig is already built or partially built, I will go over every connector and remake any I deem not worthy. In effect, I don't ever want to have to say to an artist that whatever failed was somebody else's fault ("Hey, I DIDN'T build that cable")

That said, I don't just go into a gig and rip everything out and start over just to spend the band's money (a very common occurrence).

Also, I have used soldered and solderless cables and have had equal failure with both. I've also used just about every manufacturers connectors, some I like, some I don't. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, it happens, especially on Les Pauls, as the angle of the strap is pretty severe. Looks like you'll need to replace the whole switch as from your pic it looks like a couple of the threads sheared off. Take it to a qualified repair shop (or Sam Ash or Gtr Center, if that's all there is). Shouldn't be too expensive. If it is and the switch still works, then put it off till you save up the $$. Won't hurt anything.

I'd advise getting some straplocks as well (I'm a touring gtr tech and I use them on all artist's guitars I work with, as it happens to the 'big' boys too). I like these for Les Pauls, as they are relatively cheap and work well without having to remove the original strap button. https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/099-0819-000?adpos=1o1 creative=55397627521 device=c matchtype= network=g product_id=099-0819-000 gclid=CIy11On-qNMCFRuBswodoNkOFQ

And, don't be discouraged, keep on playing, we all started out the same way.

<TEXT> Ours doesn't use the standard side screw method, which is the only place I've seen the oxidation on solderless cables. I still use a George L's cable that I've had for close to 30 years in my touring set-up for tuning guitars, it's been all over the world, no oxidation, no problems. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not sure which model you are referring to, but I don't think any of ours has a tranny right next to the input (maybe you are referring to the choke?). Anyway, Ossie the designer uses an electronic stethoscope to position the transformers on the chassis where they are quietest. Our amps are some of the quietest at idle I've ever heard (or not heard). Thanks for checking them out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Went to visit my parents yesterday (an hour away) and my Dad showed me this Walnut Secretary he's almost finished with (he has some interior drawers to go. I thought this was an interesting design with the peaks in the doors (he said it was tough), I also like the curly walnut on the drawer fronts.

FYI My Dad was a mechanical engineer and has been making furniture (mostly Shaker) as a hobby for at least 40 years, he's in his 80's. He mostly uses his ancient Craftsman Table Saw (not even a cabinet saw) and a Craftsman Radial Arm Saw.

Thanks for checking this out. He taught me a bit, I'll post some of my stuff later. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've had as many soldered cables as solderless fail on me in 20+ years of touring. I actually have a George L's cable in my touring workbox that I use with my tuner(s) that is 30 years old and has never failed. But, I know a lot of people who will never use solderless and that's OK, to each his own. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Built this up to mainly test out the Dirty Robot and Chicago Way. Signal chain is: TC polytune --Daredevil Custom The Chicago Way --BJFE Sea Blue EQ --Digitech Dirty Robot --MXR carbon copy. 

I built the board from a Rubbermade shelf from Lowe's and some U-channel and handles I had lying around. Quick and easy, thinking of doing a video how-to on this style board with parts from Lowe's or Home Depot.

Anyway, thanks for checking it out. I don't get to read this subreddit often enough...
