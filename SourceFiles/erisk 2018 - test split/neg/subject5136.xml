<TEXT>  For the US, specifically, something like 2% of CO2 comes from cargo ships

Do you have a link for that, and is that US waters only?  Most container and dry and wet freight vessels have two engines, one burns ULSD which they use in territorial waters, one burns bunker fuel which they switch to in international waters.  Bunker fuel is horrendous from a CO2 and other pollutants perspective.  </TEXT>

When I was there we definitely had the lines cleaned every two weeks - they did it during my one opening shift and was a huge pain in the ass, so I remember very well.  

Can't speak to the underwater kegs, but can say overall definitely not the cleanest spot I worked.   </TEXT>

The CSR AF does hit immediately and is hefty if you can't use the $300 travel credit pretty quickly.  They did also take down the bonus from 100k to 50k, so not sure if it's as worth it anymore... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wanted to update quick with a before and after of the worst part of the walls I plaster repaired, [here](http://imgur.com/a/8Dzvz). This wall does bulge a little and isn't perfect because I put a few pieces of sheetrock where that big open lathe was, but one of the other walls was in better condition, and came out really well, I would be happy with the quality in a new house.

I do have to say, the plaster probably took 5 times as long as hanging, taping, and mudding drywall, *but* ripping down plaster and lathe is a massive PITA (and dusty - never good in old houses) and that alone would have taken even longer than plastering.

Happy to answer any questions (although I'm no expert).  This was one of the favorite projects I've done in my house.  The walls were lathe and plaster probably 80 years old, which were later covered with wall paper, then covered with fake wood paneling, then that was painted when fake wood paneling went out of style. It was really interesting peeling back all that history, then fixing the original walls which could likely stand for another 50 years because of the quality. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would suggest learning skip trowel style texturing.  I just finished plaster repairing a few rooms in my 1905 house, and the walls are incredibly solid and professional looking, and I like them better than the sheetrock and hand texture we paid a professional for on another part of the house we tore to the studs.  

I started from basic drywall finishing experience, and plaster repair came quickly and seemed a bit easier, but the plaster was sometimes trickier to work with than sheetrock mud. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actual -209.  Relatively flat to pre-report.  Looks like eyes or on the ridge building over AK.

From CWG:

Downturn or Downfall? Over the past 24 hours, we have seen a remarkable nosedive in the Eastern Pacific Oscillation readings. Normally, such changes may show up toward the end of the 11-15 day to suggest uncertainty in the normally lower-skilled period, but these changes started happening around today's Day 10 (now 12/30, next Friday) and then persist through the balance of the period. The European ensemble is leading these changes similar to how they led to the colder pattern shift in late November (big Bering Sea high pressure spike that time). This makes me more interested in this situation and it increases the odds of a colder January outcome overall; however, the one big problem was last weekend's debacle. The European ensemble was strangely much colder than other models in the 6-10 day dealing with the storm system early next week as we reported on Sunday morning. It held that view for about 1 to 1.5 days over the weekend before it completely flipped Sunday afternoon. That 6-10 day flip suggests that even the mighty European is struggling with this pattern evolution and that we need to stay on the cautious side initially here.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am by no means confused about the misleading list used by climate *deniers* to say that global warming is not happening, is not caused by human CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions, and/or will not have net negative social and economic effects.

The overwhelming majority the scientists writing the papers in your misleading list acknowledge that global warming is happening, is caused by human released CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions, and will have net negative effect.

as they all accept that there has been a global temperature increase of **a fraction of a degree** since the end of the little ice age.

More misleading statements. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's some interesting ones from the misleading "1300 peer reviewed papers."  One of the scientific papers directly refute your Telegraph article.

 [**Anthropogenic climate change poses a serious threat to biodiversity.** In marine environments, multiple climate variables, including temperature and CO2 concentration ([CO2]), are changing simultaneously.](http://www.pnas.org/content/106/23/9316.abstract)

[**Now that it is widely accepted that global warming ishappening**, there is a growing demand for accurate forecasts of its effects, and much concern about its effects on biological diversity.](http://www.bioone.org/doi/full/10.1641/B570306)

[The mean sea level has been projected to rise in the 21st century as a result of global warming1. Such projections of sea level change depend on estimated future greenhouse emissions and on differing models, but model-average results from a mid-range scenario (A1B) suggests a 0.387-m rise by 2100 (refs 1, 2). The largest contributions to sea level rise are estimated to come from thermal expansion (0.288 m) and the melting of mountain glaciers and icecaps (0.106 m), with smaller inputs from Greenland (0.024 m) and Antarctica (- 0.074 m)1. ](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v439/n7074/abs/nature04448.html)

[Rapidly rising levels of atmospheric CO2 are not only causing ocean warming, but also lowering seawater pH hence the carbonate saturation state of the oceans, on which many marine organisms depend to calcify their skeletons](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v2/n8/full/nclimate1473.html)

[Recent global warming has demonstrated that organisms respond to climate and climatic change in a variety of ways, depending on the nature, rate and duration of the change, and the range of available biological responses ](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982209011828) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Has Monckton himself joined the debate?

Your proposed strawman (strawman used incorrectly) is not at all what I am saying.  There is connotation in the language used in the title that these papers were written to support deniers' arguments, which *they were not.* Deniers cherry picked the data out of them, amalgamated them together, then tried to use that as an argument against alarmism, which is not how it works.

And again, I scrolled through a lot of the papers, particularly about heating in the oceans, and many were along the lines of -this specific type of coral in the GBR outperformed others as the oceans heated and acidified, while admitting that there was a huge amount of bleaching and dying. That combines with another paper about a species of crab that didn't die off as expected, to argue that the ocean is fine! </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1350+ Peer-Reviewed Papers Supporting Skeptic Arguments Against ACC/AGW Alarmism.

Neither the papers nor the scientists cited are supporting deniers' arguments, which is directly stated in this title.  Deniers are cherry picking the data and pulling studies out of context to fit their narrative, then claiming the papers support them.  *Huge* difference between the two.   This title is bullshit and misleading, and on purpose.  What are you missing here?

You think that if any of these scientists were asked if they themselves or their papers were meant to disprove AGW, they would say yes?

  I was trying to give you some of those arguements

You gave me arguments unsupported by scientific evidence, and barely qualify as arguments.  What scientific papers quoted here which do purport to disprove some claims have been challenged, such as the Maldives studies on sea level rise.

Finally, Monckton flat out denies AGW, and is not a scientist.  His lectures show he doesn't understand any of the science.  He's a political hack. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not seeing many of the 1,350 articles listed describing "alarmism," let alone any denying (which is flat out what Monckton, with not scientific background, is claiming).  The *overwhelming majority* of people on that list are not skeptics and understand and support AGW, and what he's claiming that these papers reveal is not true.  Every one I've sampled is explaining regional effects, or some species will handle the human caused warming and ocean acidification better (which all climate scientists agree with).

Its there so that when you look at all of these skeptical arguments from Monckton and others and you ask 'where are they getting these numbers?' you can check the database.

"1350+ Peer-Reviewed Papers Supporting Skeptic Arguments Against ACC/AGW Alarmism."  He wrote it like this on purpose to trick people into thinking there are 1,350 papers refuting AGW.  *They don't support his bullshit arguments.* He pulls the data out of context and claim they do, but he doesn't understand the data. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The IPCC took a vote and decided that the sun has nothing to do with warming.

The **abnormal** warming.  Do you really not understand this?  That's just ridiculous.

Can you please link one of the 1,350+ studies that says AGW isn't happening?  The ones I'm looking at all show climate change is happening.  Cannot find a single one refuting it.

[Rapidly rising levels of atmospheric CO2 are not only causing ocean warming, but also lowering seawater pH hence the carbonate saturation state of the oceans, on which many marine organisms depend to calcify their skeletons](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v2/n8/full/nclimate1473.html) - Different organisms will be affected differently.  Who's saying  different?

[Recent global warming has demonstrated that organisms respond to climate and climatic change in a variety of ways, depending on the nature, rate and duration of the change, and the range of available biological responses ](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982209011828) - Same thing.

[An analysis of data pertaining to the period 18611986 reveals that (1) a 1 C rise in the mean annual air temperature of the British Isles has historically been associated with a 35% drop in the percentage of days that the United Kingdom has experienced cyclonic flow](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01027343)  - Climate scientists are the first to tell you that AGW will affect different regional climates in different ways.

Every single one acknowledges AGW is real.  Monckton full on denies it is happening.

You are a member of a religion trying to persecute skeptics as heretics.

Religion is blind following with no evidence.  There is so much evidence; it's hilarious when people call it religion.  Those 1,350 papers are evidence of AGW.  The funniest part of this is that many politicians (Inhofe for example) say that humans cannot effect the climate *because the bible refutes it.*  Projection much? </TEXT>

AES to install two energy storage projects totaling 37.5 MW, 150 MWh.

___

Once in operation, the two AES systems will combine to provide 37.5 MW of power for four hours on a nearly daily basis.

____

So, the 37.5 MW would be the power output per hour, and the MWh would be the total produced/released? </TEXT>

 This next week wasn't quite as bullish as my original take, but I thought still looking pretty bullish.

There is a huge dichotomy between the legacy CDDs and what I recorded for the GWDDs. I was actually not very good about writing down the GWDDs for several days, so my numbers may be off. But, the change week to week in GWDDs and Legacy CDDs is fascinating.

So far this summer I have found the GWDDs to be a far more reliable indicator of power </TEXT>

**Environmental Groups Change Tune on Nuclear Power**

Focus on climate change has raised profile of reactors, now viewed as reliable, carbon-free source of energy

By AMY HARDER
June 16, 2016 2:10 p.m. ET

Some of the nations most influential environmental groups are softening their longstanding opposition to nuclear power, marking a significant shift in the antinuclear movement as environmentalists priority shifts to climate change.

The change is lowering one of the biggest political hurdles facing the nuclear power industry in the U.S. and comes at a critical time, as several financially struggling reactors are set to shut down.

Because the historical context is that these groups were opposed to nuclear, their absence on the opposition front is noticed, said Joe Dominguez, executive vice president for governmental and regulatory affairs for Exelon Corp., the biggest owner of nuclear plants in the U.S. I think its pretty significant.

Nuclear power, which emits no greenhouse gases, provides roughly 20% of U.S. electricity and 60% of carbon-free electricity, according to federal data. Pressed by cheap natural gas and state policies that favor renewables over nuclear power, roughly a dozen reactors are either poised to shut down in the coming years or have already.

The Sierra Club, the countrys oldest and largest environmental group, is debating whether to halt its longtime position in support of shuttering all existing nuclear-power plants earlier than required by their federal operating licenses. The environmental groups leaders see existing reactors as a bridge to renewable electricity and an alternative source of energy as the group campaigns to shut down coal and natural gas plants.

The Environmental Defense Fund is similarly deciding to what extent it should adjust its policy, potentially lending its support to keeping open financially struggling reactors.

In Illinois, the Natural Resources Defense Council, along with the Sierra Club and EDF, are among the advocacy groups working with Exelon and state lawmakers on a legislative deal that would reverse a decision the company made in early June to close two nuclear reactors in the next two years. The agreement would promote more energy efficiency and renewable energy while ensuring the reactors remain in operation by providing financial recognition for the zero-carbon electricity they produce.

The shift in attitude, Mr. Dominguez said, has a clear impact on energy companies bottom line because it allows for agreements on statewide policies, whereas before I didnt think we could get there.

Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, says his group is focusing most of its resources on closing coal plants and preventing the construction of new natural gas plants.

Were actively debating the timeline in which nuclear plants should be decommissioned as we reduce our reliance on coal and gas in the electric sector, Mr. Brune said.

The shift is twofold. Some environmental groups that have in the past protested existing reactors are now at times staying on the sidelines. In other cases, such as the one in Illinois, environmentalists are actively working toward keeping reactors open.

Very few new nuclear plants, meanwhile, are set to come online soon because of market conditions, so the debate has focused largely on the fate of existing reactors. Most major environmental groups remain opposed to creating new nuclear plants, instead preferring renewable electricity.

Most environmentalists have long opposed nuclear power due to a host of concerns, including the risk of a catastrophic accident (a worry heightened by Japans Fukushima disaster in 2011), unresolved questions on radioactive waste storage, the potential for weapons proliferation from the fuel and a preference for renewable energy such as solar and wind.

Over the last couple of years, as climate change has climbed to the top of the agenda of nearly all major environmental groups, influential leaders in both the climate science and policy arenas have shifted positions. Many now back this carbon-free source of energy, especially the existing fleet of approximately 100 reactors at about 60 power plants, which provide a steady source of electricity compared with the intermittence of wind and solar.

Michael Shellenberger, co-founder of the Breakthrough Institute, a progressive think tank, founded an organization in January called Environmental Progress whose initial mission is focused on backing nuclear power to address climate change.

If anything gives me hope in these dark times, its that so many environmentalists are changing their minds about nuclear, said Mr. Shellenberger, who says he switched his position and began supporting nuclear power in 2011. What was just a trickle of converters a few years ago has become a positive stampede.

Some environmental groups, including Greenpeace, continue to actively fight to shut down existing nuclear plants, saying the environmental risks, from radiation emissions to waste disposal, far outweigh any climate benefit.

That is prompting these groups to oppose deals like the one in Illinois. Illinois should not be bailing out old and dangerous nuclear reactors just because they cant compete, said Jim Riccio, nuclear policy analyst for Greenpeace.

After reactors closed in Southern California and New England in 2013 and 2014, respectively, emissions in those regions rose after having declined for some time, according to data from nonprofit electricity transmission organizations. Regulators replaced those reactors with natural gas, which is often the cheapest option but emits carbon dioxide.

Mr. Dominguez of Exelon cited a December announcement by New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo in favor of the continued operation of upstate nuclear plants as symbolizing the new mood.

When Gov. Cuomo put a stake in the ground saying were going to save the upstate nuclear plants, I think that was a really significant turning point, Mr. Dominguez said. </TEXT>

Empirical data shows that you are 100% wrong.  We have established that the price of oil and ~~demand~~ the dollar are inversely related. The price of oil, fundamentally, is affected either by supply or demand.  When the price of the dollar goes up, which side of the equation does that affect?

<TEXT> Can't tell if you are serious...

If you are, my comment from elsewhere:

Oil is traded on the world market in dollars, which means that countries have to convert local currency to dollars to buy in the global markets. When the dollar is strengthening it makes oil more expensive, thus decreasing demand.

For example, for simple purposes let's say the exchange rate for a country is 100 currencies to $1. The means the can buy one barrel of WTI for $40 * 100/$1 = 4000 currencies.

Tomorrow, the dollar strengthens to to 101 to $1. You now buy one barrel of WTI for $40 * 101/$1 = 4040 currencies.

Owing to a co-ordinated prudent fiscal and monetary policy stance, inflation has been contained to single digits since 2013.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/4f7i7k/rscience_bans_and_silences_scientific_dissent_in/d275qpo

 Thanks for this (lengthy) comment. It neatly encapsulates the key flaw of criticisms of Cook et al. (2013) - the unwillingness of critics to consider the self-rating survey that replicated the 97% consensus. To my knowledge, every criticism of our research has studiously avoided the self-rating replication.
To give a quick overview of Cook et al. (2013) (freely available at http://sks.to/tcppaper), we first estimated the scientific consensus by categorising the abstracts of scientific papers about global warming. We identified ~4000 abstracts stating a position on human-caused global warming - amongst those abstracts, 97.1% endorsed the consensus.
Next, and here is the crucial part that every critic of our paper has conveniently ignored or avoided, we replicated our result by inviting the authors of the scientific papers to rate their own research. If we had mis-characterised a significant number of papers (e.g., rated them as endorsing AGW when they didn't), then there would've been a significant discrepancy between our abstract rating and the self-rating. 1200 scientists responded to our invitation, resulting in over 2000 papers receiving a self-rating. Amongst papers that were self-rated as stating a position on human-caused global warming, 97.2% endorsed the consensus.
However, when you dug deeper into the data, there was one significant discrepancy between self-ratings and our abstract ratings. More than half of the abstracts that we rated as "no position" were subsequently rated as "endorsing AGW" by the paper's own authors. So in contrast to this commenter's characterisation that we characterised papers as endorsing when they were not, quantitative analysis reveals we were actually much more likely to go the other way - characterising papers that did endorse AGW as expressing "no position" on AGW. However, the reason for this was relatively straightforward. Abstract ratings were based solely on the abstract text while self-ratings were based on the full paper, which were more likely to include an endorsement of AGW simply for space reasons.
The self-ratings also present another key statistic that I don't recall ever being mentioned by a critic of our study. Amongst papers that were self-rated as stating a position on whether humans were causing most of global warming, around 96% endorsed the consensus. So Cook et al. (2013) found that regardless of the definition used, there was overwhelming scientific agreement with the consensus position.
It's significant that critics of our study refuse to take a step back and look at the full study, with independent methods replicating the finding of an overwhelming consensus on climate change. Further, they refuse to take that extra step back and see how our finding of overwhelming consensus is replicated by a range of independent studies. That is the key result of the new "consensus on consensus" study - that the scientific consensus is robust and replicated across many studies. This new study is freely available at http://sks.to/coc

<TEXT> You argue that there is some kind of "abnormal" warming. For something to be "abnormal", there must, by definition, be a "normal".

Abnormal being the the excess warming which would not have happened without the CO2 emissions... 

The empirical data is the empirical data. There was no warming for almost two decades. Some scientists played around with deep ocean temperature data and claim that they found the missing warming.

[Flat out wrong](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v3/), and you only get this if you cherry pick the data through 2014.  But 2015 changed all that, not sure how you are still using this talking point.

It's insane. If any other hard science field such as physics, chemistry, or biology was able to cling to a theory that has time and time again led to predictions that were false, it would be a laughingstock of a field.

Because even if some scientists still want to cling to AGW as a legitimate scientific theory, the theory must be amended to account for new information.

Please link to scientific papers showing the models as a whole have been massively wrong.  Of course they will reassess factors when new information becomes available.  That in no way means AGW is wrong.

 The fact that you think that microbial evolution is not going to be a significant factor in how the Earth's climate will handle increased amounts of carbon dioxide tells me how little you understand about ecology.

More of this vague wanna-be science, with the "you totally don't understand ecology like me, man."

Ultimately, this is coming down to a matter of faith.

It's hilariously ironic that you mention faith.  In the US at least, the majority of the folks who don't understand AGW are religious people. The believe in supernatural forces told by preachers who also deny evolution and believe the Earth is a few thousand years old, yet not scientists who dedicate their lives to empirical evidence.

But keep parroting the "science". I'll enjoy cheap, abundant energy and so will my fellow countrymen in one of the most impoverished parts of the world as we grow our economies and increase our standard of living.

And there it is.  You come to the conclusion that coal is good, then go back to the science and try (poorly) to find holes.  But that's fine, I do believe that developed nations should be taking the lead towards cleaner energy, and can lead by model by vastly expanding incredibly clean, incredibly cheap energy - nuclear.  </TEXT>

There has been no warming for a decade and a half (arguably two decades).

The IPCC models were wrong.

<TEXT> I've gotten stopped out being short a few times in the past few weeks trading NG, not the greatest month of trading, but made some really nice trades in CL which made up.  Some updated things I'm looking at for shoulder season:

Weather correlation to shoulder is fairly low, I haven't been looking too much at the 1-15 days models, but demand a decent amount above normal.  

Production has been flat, and I think a little will drop off going forward due to capex cuts the past year, and some possible bankruptcies.  y/y: .7 b/d to LNG exports, 1 b/d Mexports, probably .5-1.5 b/d from Canada less puts pretty tight supply wise.

Good consensus on a hot La Nina summer.  Same ideas as before about hydro, wind, solar.

The market will price us for EOS from 3800-4000 tcf.  I think there will be a little more push down, but bullish mid-summer to next winter. 

But look at last shoulder season last year - Late April, NG was 50 cents higher, producers had much higher hedges, with a looser S/D and the looming notion of an El Nino cool summer, warm winter. It then proceeded to rally 70 cents.  So I'm on the sidelines for now, looking to buy dips at technical points. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Capitalism and free markets are not the problem that need to be regulated to quell AGW.

I think capitalism and markets are absolutely the solution, if energy production is properly priced.  

The problem that needs to be regulated is the human population itself...

While I don't necessarily disagree with population being out of control and a culling would help the problem, poor countries have tiny emissions per capita, and much of the development work, at least where I've been involved, is focused on non-fossil fuel energy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I received a multi-cooker from extended family member for Christmas, and already having a slow cooker, rice cooker, stove top pressure cooker, and yogurt maker, wasn't overly excited. But then I started using it, and was very happy.  If you wash basmati rice really well, it makes perfect sticky rice - better than my rice cooker.  I haven't tried the paella style, but will soon.  The pressure cooking setting works great, and you can brown before slow cooking.  I'm not an expert with yogurt making but seemed to do a good job.  My only complaints are it's a little small for slowcooking, and it's very noisy when cooking rice.  I think mine is Presto brand?  I'll check later.

OP - When moving into your own place, I highly suggest as many multi-items as possible.  It gives you extra room in your kitchen, and much easier when you are packing up the kitchen and moving.  I made that mistake, and now I'm trying to get rid of things I never use that are filling up my kitchen. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  "I'm actually in the oil industry/representing the oil industry and using futures contracts as intended."

Published every Tuesday from the previous Friday.  Do you really not know what the CoT is? Edit: And please explain the intended purpose of futures contracts.

If I'm reading you correctly, you're factoring in that "trading just to trade" crowd as part of S/D by default

What I'm saying with deliverability is: If there futures contract price is that out of whack with the physical markets, physical players will make or take delivery.  And this does happen, more often in softs and metals than energy.  That hints at something.

Here's the way see it and why I don't think my "no reason to have fallen 80%" comment isn't really out of line.

There's too much oil being produced, not enough being used; simple as that.  It has to be priced out of the market.  80% decline appears to have had some effect, and there was, without a question, a reason why prices fell 80%.

You keep on using the word sheep.  I think you need to learn a little more about energy markets before you continue throwing that word around. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If your view is that the current price is "correct"....which is impossible, because the fundamentals in both time frames were virtually the same.

I guess we disagree with what fundamentals are.  But, I would wholeheartedly disagree with every word in this statement:

There's also no good reason it should have lost 80% of it's value in nine months either. It's all trading desk driven speculation and sheep following sheep. Trying to retroactively apply actual energy market fundamentals to it or rationalize the movement will just leave you dazed and confused.

There were plenty of reasons for it to lose 80% of it's value, massive amounts of reasons.  It's "trading desk driven" not only from HFT and other trading desks, but from physical cash transactions driven by direct S/D, with speculation in there of course. Applying actual energy market fundamentals to it absolutely sheds light to the crazy S/D imbalance.  There are certainly sheep, but there were plenty of people that saw the imbalance and made ungodly amounts of money in both oil and NG.

My one and only point is that prices are a function of trading pressure moving them for trading gains, not a result of fundamentals.

You don't think that trading pressure comes from fundamentals?  You do know that every major futures contract has deliverability, right?  You do know that physical oil trades flat price elsewhere, and against non-futures benchmarks other places, right? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Again, I'm not sure what you're not looking at that you believe there wasn't something in the fundamentals that justified an 80% price drop.  I would actually argue that the s/d imbalance *not* changing in the past 1.5 years is exactly what justified that kind of price swing.  Do you really believe there isn't an imbalance that led to almost every storage medium close to filling?

Or, like recent years have shown, after subsidizing you end up with technologies that are incredibly cost efficient (nuclear), and technologies that are very close to be cost efficient and dispatachable (intermittent renewables with battery backup).  The alternative could be that these technologies simply go bankrupt and nowhere. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. Remove all regulations that make it harder to start a business.

I always hear "remove regulations," what specific regulations do you suggest getting rid of that will help alternative energy, efficiency companies, etc. 

2. Remove unnecessary regulations on nuclear power. 

I do think nuclear is absolutely key if we want to do anything about climate change, but what specific regulations are unnecessary?

3. Get rid of all subsidies... even for clean energy companies. 

Unfortunately fossil fuels have had decades of subsidies to help them get way ahead.  And without externalities priced into the system, there's no free market to take care of the problem.

The reduction of greenhouse gases can only be accomplished through free enterprise. The left thinks government can stop climate change, but all government will do is destroy individual freedom while doing very little to actually prevent climate change.

Agree with the first, but without the externalities priced into the market, markets won't take care of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> /NG is in a tough place now.  Ending the season with 2400+ ( in storage, a record and should keep a cap on any significant strength - ICE swap EOD 2440/2490 (2470 settle) as of yesterday. There could be a one last shot of cold the last week of March, but the difference between 2500 and 2450 in storage won't make a huge difference.  The next few days have record low GWDD for same days, next week's report could see an injection.  

Looking at summer, early analogs for some heat M-Q. But hydro will be much higher yoy - 1998 CA hydro 49.5TWh, 2015 was in the low teens. More coal retirements and build out of NG PB, but also much more wind and solar coming online.

The big decider going forward is production.  I'm of the opinion that there was a lot of hedged and contracted gas for the winter strip, and April should finally see production roll over some.  But it has been incredibly resilient, so dangerous bet.

I was, and still am, starting to get bullish for later in the curve, but I think short front months, build length late summer through winter. But any significant strength will be met with production coming back online, there are plenty of companies ready.  I'm short J at the moment, and probably put on a spread this week or next. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dumping water Lauren was really childish and the two (females) she was talking with probably weren't pleased about it either, but the *attack helicopter* and *science and technology* arguments were pretty ridiculous and didn't really make reasonable debate, and I didn't see many libertarian arguments.

The dragon-kin and other silly 12 year old attention grabbing Tumblr posts get the most attention, but there are legitimate people who don't identify as male or female, and there's plenty of scientific research going into gender identity whether or not folks here agree with it. It's still a very new field of psychology.

Forcing your ideals onto another through the government or attacks on free speech clearly aren't, but why would direct mocking of someone's identity be libertarian?  In the gender part specifically, she kept on calling herself libertarian, but I didn't see many arguments to believe she was a libertarian, all I saw was anti-SJW.  Being anti-SJW in the context of defending free speech is one thing, but just by this video I don't see the libertarian arguments showing up strongly. </TEXT>

Bulls are violent when mating, and have a low success rate for fertilization.  Artificial insemination also allows for artificial selection and spreading genes to reduce inbreeding and promote stronger animals.

There's plenty wrong with the ag systems in the US, but this is hardly one of them.  Even the ranches that promote focus on proper animal treatment artificially inseminate. </TEXT>

And we are going to make abundantly clear to any militant on the face of the planet, if you wage jihad against the United States of America and try to murder innocent Americans, you are signing your death warrant."

When it comes to a question of legalizing marijuana, I dont support legalizing marijuana."

Im a Christian first, American second, conservative third and Republican fourth...Ill tell ya, there are a whole lot of people in this country that feel exactly the same way.

"I will stop illegal immigration, build a wall that works, triple border security, and put in place the surveillance and biometric tracking to secure the border."

I would say these are very stark contrast to Johnson's positions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So a group of armed citizens, who on tape explicitly said they would not go back to jail.  Run from the feds, then attempt to ram through a road block. Jump out of the car, and run away, in what many would say (I agree) looks like reaching for a weapon.

This is the same as a woman getting raped because of what she's wearing and where she is.   Actively breaking the law (whether or not you agree with it), carrying weapons, and implying you will die rather than go to jail, is the same as an innocent victim being raped by a perpetrator.  

Terrible, terrible victim blaming analogy.

I try with this sub sometimes, but half of the posts on here are indistinguishable from /r/conspiracy.  The "burn this down" is hilarious though, as I'm sure the release of this tape has even further alienated the group from the public </TEXT>

With that gone, any decent sized premium caused by geopolitical or other reasons will be filled by basis arbitrage, especially with how flush the world is with oil.

I'm asking a question, why the hostility?

 But don't you think that if they needed guns and couldn't get them legally, that they would get them through whatever means necessary? 

Honestly, I think for a lot of the mass shooting they wouldn't.  I can't imagine the Newtown kid being able to find a gun on the black market.  Sure, some of them would, especially the ones are planning it out.

The biggest issue with mass shootings that has come up over the years is that a lot of those shooters have some kind of mental health issues.

Isn't one of the big pushes for gun control to get mental health screening linked to the background checks?

How about instead of criticizing people about whether or not they own guns, and we all focus on getting funding for better mental health services across the nation?

Completely agree. I think many of the same people who are anti-gun control also very much want to cut public funding for mental health services.  I have yet to see how they would be replaced by the private market... </TEXT>

<TEXT> This case took 5 years, a warrant, and an advanced hacking technique to nail these scumbags on, in my opinion, one of the most horrific crimes around (the making and supporting of kiddie porn), and highest of priority for the FBI.

I'd say it seems pretty secure for someone who just wants to not be watched online.  For me, Tor is just a pain in the ass.

The quotes in that article are pretty funny though.  How terrible would it be to be the lawyer defending a child porn peddler. </TEXT>

Figures are calculated by dividing each state's "Intergovernmental Revenue" by its "General Revenue." "General Revenue" includes all tax revenue but excludes utility revenue, liquor store revenue, and investment income from state pension funds.

This includes federal funding for military bases, national parks and forests (WY MT), national labs (NM), among others. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Farming is unprofitable *because of the government subsidies.* The market is sending a price signal to stop producing because your marginal costs and higher than your marginal revenue.

The price floor subsidies artificially inflate your marginal revenue so that it is above your marginal costs, sending the exact opposite signal, and producers increase production *further reducing marginal revenue.*

People talk about corn because it is not only top 3 crops by acreage, volume, dollar amount, subsidies, but also because the demand side is artificially created by the corn ethanol market, an "environmental" product with a terrible EROEI.  Sugarcane ethanol has 5x the EROEI, but quotas and tariffs are crazy for imported sugar.  

The government inefficiencies go deep in corn. </TEXT>

Burned?  But you are correct, I've seen nothing but stupid nonsense in your arguments.

Also for the record Creationism is a fraction of the population and it's their religious belief.

You've learned fractions, congratulations!  Per Pew Research, that specific fraction is upwards of 48/100.  I've yet to see an argument against evolution that isn't based in religion.  The point is when you use fairy tales as a basis for scientific opinion, why would that opinion be valid over researchers who base their opinion on the scientific method and decades of experimentation.

You should understand skepticism and nuance if you're in Libertarian. But maybe not if you prefer to be bathed in depravity and call it science.

Skepticism is fine.  Using your political biases to come to a decision, then rejecting scientific evidence and consensus because it disagrees with your political biases while endlessly searching for garbage blogs which agree is not libertarian. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A few comments from a disheartened leftist who has been coming here for a while.

 Wants to defund planned parenthood

Pandering.

 Against equal rights for gays to marry

I truly think he is for getting the government out of marriage.  Unfortunately in the Republican party, you have to pander to evangelicals to get anywhere.  That's the state of our terrible system.

 wants to cut corporate taxes

[Highly suggest this planet money podcast on what economists across the spectrum agree on.  "Three: Eliminate the corporate income tax. Completely. If companies reinvest the money into their businesses, that's good. Don't tax companies in an effort to tax rich people."](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/07/19/157047211/six-policies-economists-love-and-politicians-hate)

 supports funding charter schools

You are against charter schools?  

 doesn't support federal education standards

This is a tough one, but teaching to testing is not a strong educational policy.  Having lived extensively in China, this is exactly what they do, students work ungodly hours but learn nothing.

 wants to end the department of education

I really think we need some big shakeup in our education system.  We spend more money every year, and tests get worse every year.

 wants to repeal all regulations against pollution and fossil fuels
 wants to sell public lands for resource exploitation
 doesn't think EPA should be able to regulate greenhouse gas emissions
 supports mountain top removal mining
 pretty much has 0 support for anything environmental related unless it lowers taxes

Some of my big issues, and the question of pollution, climate change, etc. is brought up in this sub regularly.  This is a tough one for libertarians, and there are many opposing views on this.  I personally don't agree with him on any of these. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  That is one solution. Businesses can also be legally bound by contracts to minimize their levels of pollution. They can also be taken to court since pollution is a form of aggression. Polluters can also be socially ostracized. All of these things are legitimate practices in a Libertarian society.

My issue with this is that libertarian solutions I typically see are reactionary rather than preventionary (word?).

Even if you can prove in court that someone polluted and get money from the entity (if they are still solvent), which is costly endeavor in itself, that doesn't prevent the action in the first place. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Colbert analogy was a poor one.

Getting a job after college requires a massive amount of work, no matter the degree.

For a STEM major, it requires a huge amount of work in class, and a decent amount outside - extracurricular, networking, etc.

For a FA major, it requires a small amount of work in class, and a *massive* amount outside.

I think FA draws people that don't want to do the work.  I wrote this in a comment below:

The 30-year pact underscores Chevrons standing as the Kingdoms oldest private partner and reaffirms a long tradition of friendship and shared success. Working in partnership with the Kuwait Gulf Oil Co., Saudi Arabian Chevron (SAC) operates four fields and more than 1,000 wells; in 2005, the PZ produced its three billionth barrel of oil. In recent years, SAC has consistently exceeded production targets while compiling millions of work-hours of safe operations."

<TEXT> I'll try to run some back of the envelope numbers if I get a minute, but the elasticity of demand isn't great enough to counter a 30-40% decrease in prices and tax receipts if it's a direct percentage.  Fluctuations in budgets can further inefficiencies - having to hire and train, then lay off employees for example.

Another comment above you suggested a 5 or 10 year moving average, which could be more consistent.  Keeping up with inflation is definitely the key, *if* the starting value is enough to offer decent upkeep for the infrastructure.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Text if you get paywalled:

Peabody Energy, one of the largest global coal producers, will submit revised investor disclosures after the New York attorney-generals office found it misled the public and investors about the financial risks associated with climate change.

The Peabody settlement announced Monday is the first to emerge from the state attorney-generals probe of oil and energy companies, and reflects a rare move forcing companies to make certain disclosures about climate change.

ExxonMobil is also being investigated about whether it misled shareholders and the public about climate change risks and how it could affect the company. The company received a subpoena last week requesting emails, financial records and other documents.

The Peabody case is seen as distinct from Exxon, which is also being investigated for consumer fraud, said people familiar with the probes. In comparison with Peabody, Exxon is suspected of making a broader number of claims and potentially misleading statements to consumers stretching from the 1970s to this year, which could carry large penalties, the people said.

Peabody will not have to pay any fines because it was difficult to prove that shareholders had been harmed as the claims the company made involved the future affect of climate change on Peabodys profits, people familiar with the situation said.
Peabody will have to file revised disclosures with the Securities and Exchange Commission that accurately and objectively represent climate change risks, including concerns about the environmental impacts of coal combustion...[that] could significantly affect demand for our products or our securities, the state attorney-generals office said.

As a publicly traded company whose core business generates massive amounts of carbon emissions, Peabody Energy has a responsibility to be honest with its investors and the public about the risks posed by climate change, now and in the future, attorney-general Eric Schneiderman said. I believe that full and fair disclosures by Peabody and other fossil fuel companies will lead investors to think long and hard about the damage these companies are doing to our planet.

Peabody repeatedly denied in SEC filings that it could predict the affect of potential climate change regulation on its business, although the company and its consultants made projections that such rules would have severe affects on Peabody, Mr Schneidermans office said.

I believe that full and fair disclosures by Peabody and other fossil fuel companies will lead investors to think long and hard about the damage these companies are doing to our planet

For example, Peabodys internal projections showed that if certain regulation for power plants and future electricity generation were enacted, it would reduce its coal sales by at least 33 per cent.

Peabody did not admit or deny wrongdoing as part of the settlement, and will include disclosures reflecting the settlement starting in its third-quarter filing. The company said any future claims about the difficulty of making projections around climate change regulation will be accompanied by statements that show the company has made predictions about the affect of certain laws, which could hurt the markets or the company.

The company has always sought to make appropriate disclosures, Peabody said in a statement. Subsequent disclosures evolve over time. Peabody has been involved in major global initiatives to reduce carbon emissions for nearly two decades.
Mr Schneidermans investigation may widen to include other oil and energy companies, while other states could join in the probe.

The investigation into fossil fuel companies has drawn parallels with the probe into the tobacco industrys knowledge of the risks of smoking. That led to class-action lawsuits that resulted in huge payouts.

However, Howard Erichson, a law professor at Fordham University who is an expert on class-action suits, said it was difficult to see how similar actions could be pursued over climate change.

Its different at both ends, he said. With the effects of climate change, some of them at least are experienced by more than seven billion people in the world. And some of the cost is imposed by billions of individuals as well as an immense number of companies. </TEXT>

I hope to be getting cows soon so they can live a similar life, then my family gets a massive amount of happiness shortly after.

[Fairly simple, see this chart.](http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/NA-CG479_BUDGET_16U_20150713140009.jpg)

In reality, the effects of the deficit for both presidents had much more to do with the fact that we went into a recession in 2008. Recessions vastly reduces government receipts if spending remains the same, or in this case increased for the stimulus.

<TEXT> Some decent points, and I agree with consolidation of US producers benefiting SA, but he uses the same old rhetoric of SA being the ones who flooded the market, because they didn't manipulate the market *against their own benefit,* when in reality their prodx was flat, and US shale were the ones who flooded the market.

Edit:  One more note:

Most smaller shale producers will struggle to make it, if the price of oil remains under $60 per barrel, which it will probably do until Saudi Arabia cuts back on production.

Many smaller shale companies are doing fine, as long as they aren't over leveraged. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't speak for nuclear specifically, but I lived in China for a long time.

A good friend worked for a Western company that designed facilities which extracted metals from mine waste water to clean the water.  The company worked with mines all over Canada, the US, Chile.  The companies in the West had tailing ponds and worked with his company for regulatory and general health purposes.  The mine in China dumped the waste water directly back into the river, and found his company only because nickel prices were particularly high at the time. 

They had an exact turn key design built for highly corrosive processes.  The local engineers took the design and stripped it to the absolute bare bones.  They took out the durimet screws and replaced with cheap stainless steel.  When he was very adamant that they cannot do that, they told him they couldn't get durimet in China.  They removed the nickel depositing bin, and replaced it with migrant workers shoveling nickel without gloves.  There were leaks and sulfuric acid spraying from about every joint.

Again, I can't speak for nuclear, but for the mining industry (and construction in general) this is the norm, not an exception. </TEXT>

Then, get into Feb, you're at record seasonal storage and production won't be dropping significantly, your shoulder season won't see much demand as warmth arrives earlier and you're due for sub $2 gas for the March and April forward contracts by the time you get to Valentine's day.

There's a little choked back, both for shut-ins for hopeful winter pricing and waiting for take-away capacity coming online, but Marcellus and Utica are the only plays increasing.  Everywhere else is losing b's. 

and international economies appear to be slowing

LNG is a very tiny demand at the moment, total .05 bcf/d now.  Liquifaction and shipping are ~$4-6/mmbtu to go international.  International slowdowns will have very little effect on LNG exports. Russia deals would more so.

Exports to Mexico have been been very strong, but estimating lower for the month average.  Still well above last year.  There were very few analysts projecting 3bcf/d late summer.

we may not see much of a price increase this winter.

Agree upside potential is capped, but HUGE short CoT for MM.  Incredibly bearish GFS runs all week, and yet still not falling.  That first whiff of cold air could see a very quick .20 rally, possibly even larger with the short squeeze. Very crowded on the short side.  See May this year.

I also think a scorcher El Nino winter is priced in.

If there is *any* negative externality, it is wrong by Austrian economics, no matter the objective economic outcome.  Which I understand and is the basis of the school, but debates here tend to start on shoddy economic foundations, when questioned and picked apart, always come back to redistribution and taxation are literally slavery and theft at gunpoint.

at $10.10/hour min wage it's estimated that 500,000 people will lose their jobs.

Nor is a moderate minimum wage as undesirable as neoclassical purists suggest. Unlike those in textbooks, real labour markets are not perfectly competitive. Since workers who want to change jobs face costs and risks, employers may be able to set pay below its market-clearing rate. </TEXT>

at some point, the minimum wage will have huge negative externalities, agree or disagree?...

Completely agree. At $20000/hour it would have huge negative externalities. That's why no one is advocating for it, and why it's such a terrible argument.  At $10.10, very minor externalities.  Do you not agree there would be positive externalities from a marginal increase?

<TEXT> The other problem is that Austrian economists only talk in absolutes, where as mainstream economists talk in terms of cost benefit analysis. So Austrian economists will frequently reply with a strawman, "If raising the minimum wage to $15 is good, then why not just raise it to $20000?" Which is a really stupid question.

This could not be more right, and this garbage is spouted regularly around here. Do you think this is a good argument? </TEXT>

Sure, but to assume it's a neat, linear relationship is wrong.

It's explicit goal is to monetize the externalities, making alternatives much more affordable, relatively.  You should look up what the revenue neutral part means, government benefits would be small to non-existe.  I'm not sure what segment of the population is getting fucked over. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry, was on mobile.  

My point is that there's this impression that the overwhelming amount of shale oil needs 90+ to make money.  This simply isn't true. In late 2014, service companies had every rig on a 3 month wait list, were paying high school dropouts 200k (not necessarily a bad thing - great for local economies) and upper execs ungodly bonuses, while turning 20% profit margins. 

This is a large reason why production costs were so high.  Those costs have dropped substantially as service providers are forced to actually compete and become lean, and costs will continue to drop as technology is forced to improve.  And the pop above 62 for prompt WTI allowed a lot of producers to hedge cal 16, 17 - that bump was a pretty substantial game changer.

Traditional global wells are the ones cutting spending the most and curtailing projects, and on projects that have 2-3 year lead times.  Shale oil can have 6 month lead time from initial infrastructure, 3 months for sites with infrastructure, and almost instant production for wells in the frac-log, although reports waver on how much it has decreased. </TEXT>

But cash costs from start to finish a well have dropped drastically since Oct/Nov as everyone along the value chain gets squeezed and half the rigs sit idle. Good wells properly hedged are making a similar net to 90+ times. </TEXT>

Previous prodx was hedged at 90, with costs at 80+. Some marginal wells higher than that, and those owners should go under.

New wells hedged above 62, Q2 costs well below 60.

If you are hedged, your cash price is below production, but you are *not* below production costs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Decent companies hedged through 15, 16.  Their costs were higher, but netting similar, even after 50% drop. Companies not hedged and in bad spots should go bankrupt for negligence.

The trajectory of oil production had rigs not dropped was astronomical.

Any producer who knew anything the past few weeks hedged when prompt was 62. Their current costs, with ~1/2 the US rigs looking for a home, is below 60 for good locations, same costs Nov were 80+. </TEXT>

<TEXT> At this point comparing it to what?

Comparing boom-time service costs, when every rig in the US was backlogged, to bust-time costs is not a good comparison.

Many wells are now profitable w/ oil at 60, when they were previously profitable at 90.  While many locations still aren't doing great, thinking that they are selling 60 and paying 80+/bbl total service costs is off. </TEXT>

 And you don't care about biodiversity? About monoculture? About water and so many other factors? But, that's not even the point. The point is that you can't just harvest old growth forests and say "Well they had stopped sequestering carbon, so it doesn't count."

I brought this up because we had this exact argument a few weeks back.  You were arguing for industrialized food systems, and I brought the argument of corn and soy to CAFOs - the real monoculture - vs. pasture raised and finished, a biodiverse ecosystem.  It's funny that you mention monoculture.

I'm certainly not arguing for tearing down old growth forests to ship across the ocean to burn for electricity, just showing some perspective for food systems. </TEXT>

There was some discussion in another thread last week about China's use of robots, WSJ reported on it over the weekend.

Some interesting points:

"China already ranks as the worlds largest market for robotic machines. Sales last year grew 54% from a year earlier, and the boom shows every sign of increasing. China is projected to have more installed industrial robots than any other country by next year, according to the International Federation of Robotics."

"One reason China will continue booming is because it has relatively low robot density, the trade group says. China has about 30 robots for every 10,000 factory workers. In Germany, the density is 10 times that amount."

"Meanwhile, there is little evidence so far that robots are having a big impact on employment. Average urban wages in China rose more than 10% in 2014, even as the country remains on target to create at least 10 million new jobs this year." </TEXT>

a black baker to make a confederate flag cake or require a Jewish baker to make a nazi flag cake

But that's not what happened with the Christian bakers.  They wouldn't make any cake for a gay couple, but they would make the exact cake for a straight couple. It was the people vs. the content, which I know it doesn't matter to you - they should be allowed to choose how they like, and I lean towards agreeing with that sentiment.

BUT your comment, and many I've heard in this sub, came off as "these poor Christian bakers, being enslaved by gay rights dictators. What did they ever do?" while *actively lobbying* for preventing someone else's rights to marriage. i.e.

But it baffles me how many of these blind *raw raw science* people think that commecialized transgenics are creating super cool, futuristic crops, when the overwhelming, vast majority of approved - and likely near future - transgenics, by any number, are glyphosate and other herbicide resistant, and bt corn and soy to animal feed and ethanol.  These crops are hugely subsidized with a price floor that sends the *exact opposite* signal that a market would.

A huge amount of the corn to animal feed goes to CAFOs, creating horribly sick cows pumped full of antibiotics.   There's [more and more evidence](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/document-1355766984329/) that grass fed beef has advantages for the environment over CAFO fattening beyond the health of the animal.

Ungodly subsidized, giant, sterile monoculture corn and soy corn fields feed into giant, disease ridden CAFO facility which has to pump the animals full of antibiotics because they are sick from the living conditions and food they aren't meant to eat.

Here we have 100% of the used land as the complete opposite of biodiverse.

Alternative system:

Biodiverse, healthy grasslands raising other animals with synergies - mainly broiler and laying chickens.  

Here, assuming the assertions I made are completely wrong, we use marginally more land for production - but that land we are using is significantly more biodiverse than the industrial system. But if the alternative systems are further developed possibly less.   This article isn't helping the case for further development.

I also didn't see the carbon previously sequestered in the soil when corn fields are tilled being released back into the atmosphere, nor carbon sequestered from healthy grassland, of which Iowa has released huge amounts of.  And in the study the "waste" products - for field systems they are an valuable input and go back into the fields.  For large scale CAFOs they become a toxic waste that goes into tailing ponds. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Earlier:

We should take up every bit of earth that we can? Not worry about biodiversity?

I'm arguing that the industrial meat supply chain starts with one giant, sterile monoculture (corn), and moves into another giant monoculture (CAFOs), which, due to the "efficiencies" of industrial agriculture are disease ridden, baron landscapes in which sickly animals live knee deep in their own shit, and are pumped full of antibiotics because of their living conditions and consuming food they did not evolve to eat.  I'm also arguing that you can get equal and often higher production returns from non-industrial, innovative food systems *which actually have biodiversity*.

You said that industrial agriculture promotes biodiversity.

The demand is there for ethanol because of laws, mandates,

On a similar note, price floor subsidies encourage massively inefficient of monoculture production below variable costs, when the market signal should be the exact opposite. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well considering corn accounts for [more than 90% of grain feed](http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/crops/corn/background.aspx) production, which leads directly into other giant [monoculture facilities](http://www.pokyfeeders.com/) which take a valuable nutrient, manure, and turn it into toxic waste requiring tailing ponds for disposal... it's probably something you should look into?

And then there's ethanol, which I'm sure you're incredibly fond of...

What crops are you arguing for? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess you are right in the sense of correlation doesn't necessarily mean causation, but there is a pretty strong correlation with increase of monoculture and consolidation of farming and processing facilities. 

I work very closely with the ABCDs of ags and have witnessed the massive consolidation and the USDA policies which have come with it, so I'm going to go ahead and make that jump that correlation equals causation.

And don't even get me started with the disastrous monoculture of feedlots and egg laying facilities. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  How does big agriculture prevent diversity of crop? Both big and small will grow the same crop if there is a demand for it.

It doesn't *necessarily* prevent it, but has has absolutely, undoubtedly proven to. Big ag has led to a giant monoculture supply chain. And the demand you speak of is artificially created by market manipulation, created by none other than big ag lobbying the USDA. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  1) While the law today requires hospitals to not deny life-saving emergency room treatment, even in a free market a lot of hospitals would likely continue that policy on a more limited basis, save the persons life and send them the bill. Maybe it would force them into bankruptcy, but at least they would be alive.

Or they could be alive *and* not be in bankruptcy?

 2) Statists always look at one side of the equation, so lets look at the other side. Medicare has projected futures costs of 50 trillion, as in 150K for every man, woman, and child in the USA. As in over 300K for every family, and that's just medicare, not all regulatory and tax costs. Are people really serious in thinking that health care charity wouldn't be enough if people got their money back.

Do you think the average person will have less than 150k in medical expenses from Medicare eligible age on?

 3) In the unregulated computer sector, price performance doubles every few years, and we know that removing regulations would drastically drive down prices because that's why many of the regulations were put in to begin with. In the early 1900's, medical professionals were bitterly complaining that health care was too inexpensive, and that the government needed to do something about it. It did. The insurance industry is also heavily regulated, and that drives up costs.

Do you have a source for the part about regulations intentionally increasing prices? 

 4) Government patent cartels drastically increases the cost of medicine. That's why the recent hep-c cure costs 30K or so in the USA, and 1-2K in India.

I completely agree here not to mention laws disallowing Medicaid and Medicare to negotiate on prices, but playing devil's advocate, how are companies going to recoup R D costs?  Wouldn't advances in medicine decrease?

 5) Government spending on health care distorts the health care market. If the state willing to pay 20K for a procedure, then you had better believe that's what everybody is going to charge for it.

Isn't an argument I've seen quite often that providers aren't accepting Medicaid patients because the state pays too little? </TEXT>

<TEXT> That argument is based on empirically unsupported premises: that prohibition decreases use and abuse rates, and that repealing prohibition laws increases use and abuse rates.

All that prohibition does is turn casual users of drugs into criminals, and it turns addicts - people who should be treated as though they have a medical condition - into hardened criminals. If we were to instead take all that wasted money from the criminal justice system into education and health programs, there would likely be much better results. </TEXT>

So instead of these SWFs adding "liquidity" to a market that is awash with "liquid" funds sitting as excess reserves at the Fed, money will be returned to people, who will then spend that money on things that will possibly increase revenues in companies that these these liquid funds should be investing in, and the whole QE process was designed to promote.

<TEXT> [This was posted a little bit back, and it did come from Bernie Sanders' site](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/koch-brothers), so with little explanation about how these policies would work and private sector alternatives, but I personally believe that 99% of voting population (see medicare and SS) would disagree with a large amount of the policies, and what they do agree with is personified within the other two main parties.  

We urge the repeal of federal campaign finance laws, and the immediate abolition of the despotic Federal Election Commission.

We favor the abolition of Medicare and Medicaid programs.

We oppose any compulsory insurance or tax-supported plan to provide health services, including those which finance abortion services.

We favor the repeal of the fraudulent, virtually bankrupt, and increasingly oppressive Social Security system. Pending that repeal, participation in Social Security should be made voluntary.

We oppose all personal and corporate income taxation, including capital gains taxes.

We support the eventual repeal of all taxation.

As an interim measure, all criminal and civil sanctions against tax evasion should be terminated immediately.

We support repeal of all law which impede the ability of any person to find employment, such as minimum wage laws.

We advocate the complete separation of education and State.  Government schools lead to the indoctrination of children and interfere with the free choice of individuals. Government ownership, operation, regulation, and subsidy of schools and colleges should be ended.

We condemn compulsory education laws  and we call for the immediate repeal of such laws.

We support the repeal of all taxes on the income or property of private schools, whether profit or non-profit.

We support the abolition of the Environmental Protection Agency.

We support abolition of the Department of Energy.

We call for the dissolution of all government agencies concerned with transportation, including the Department of Transportation.

We specifically oppose laws requiring an individual to buy or use so-called "self-protection" equipment such as safety belts, air bags, or crash helmets.

We advocate the abolition of the Federal Aviation Administration.

We advocate the abolition of the Food and Drug Administration.

We support an end to all subsidies for child-bearing built into our present laws, including all welfare plans and the provision of tax-supported services for children.

We oppose all government welfare, relief projects, and aid to the poor programs. All these government programs are privacy-invading, paternalistic, demeaning, and inefficient. The proper source of help for such persons is the voluntary efforts of private groups and individuals.

We call for the privatization of the inland waterways, and of the distribution system that brings water to industry, agriculture and households.

We call for the repeal of the Occupational Safety and Health Act.

Please tell me if these are fringe libertarian policies, but from what I understand this is pretty standard.  You hear quite a bit about how libertarianism is "socially liberal, fiscally conservative," and "smaller, less intrusive government," which sound nice, but I think to be incredibly misleading until you see it in policy framework.   </TEXT>

It's like a stock market but with people.

um....

Nobody would voluntarily pay taxes if they could get the same stuff without taxes (Eric Garner knows all about this).

That's why CO marijuana with high taxes is failing so badly.

Our system is one that will adapt to the most efficient use of resources, whatever that may be, and this can happen overnight.

Nope.

Yours is one that requires legislators and bills to change, and can take months (notice how congress got literally nothing done for like two years).

I don't know *that* much about socialist ideology, but I'm going with Nope.

An anarchist society would not allow rampant immigration such as this, and if all governments were gone then noone would need to immigrate anywhere because it would be a waste of time because they have all the awesome things that they could ever want right there

You should probably understand how insurance companies make money before you post this kind of stuff.

 The revenue to pay for all this comes almost exclusively from the payment of insurance premiums. This means that the typical policyholder, in a typical year, must pay MORE in premiums than he or she gets back in insurance benefits.

<TEXT> [The most recent (as of writing this) Planet Money](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2015/03/27/395815221/episode-613-trash) is about trash and recycling.  It's a shame, but in the US landfills are actually quite cheap, they are allocating more space, and using less of it.  The key to recycling is that the product streams have to be profitable for it to work as an unsubsidized business, and because oil is so cheap right now the lower quality plastics - like grocery bags - are unprofitable and often go to the landfill even when the recycling facility has the ability to recycle them. They are also interesting methods like injecting water and air into landfills to decompose the organic material, but the semi-anaerobic decomposition is much higher in methane emissions.

There is the same thing all over Tibet.  Plastic is a recent introduction so the previous landfills areas that would decompose are huge plastic bag depositories. </TEXT>

"Fact is, that we should stop those things we can stop," Christie said. "And as long as I'm governor of New Jersey, there won't be legalized marijuana in this state. And I think other states that have gone down the path of that experiment  mostly in pursuit of tax riches  have shown unless the federal government changes their mind on this, that it becomes a cash business. And not impugning cash businesses, but they tend  at times  to maybe not be the most compliant taxpayers in the world."

Except CO exceeded tax intake projections, and wasn't in search of tax riches to begin with.

<TEXT> For me, the searing is about texture and locking in flavor and moisture.

If you throw a non-seared cut into the slow cooker, it often will turn to mush.  The sear gives some texture to the meat and separates it from the dish, while still adding the fat and savory flavors.  It will also keep some moisture within the cut, similar reasoning to why you heat oil in a frying pan before throwing stuff in. </TEXT>

I welcome any critique as it was really good, but was't perfect.  Also, I was called a *barbarian* for ice bathing my noodles.  Thoughts?

**Ingredients**:

	3 lbs. pork loin or similar

	Package of ramen  we went with some nicer ramen, but any will work

	6 oz shitake mushrooms

	 yellow onion

	5 green onions

	2 inches of ginger

	3 cloves garlic

	Juice of lime

	Tbsp black bean paste

	6 oz shitake mushrooms

	 yellow onion

	5 green onions

	2 inches of ginger

	3 cloves garlic

	Juice of lime

	Tbsp black bean paste

	2 Tbsp sriracha

<TEXT>  Of course if these factors do work to suppress prices in the near term by keeping production high, it'll only make the inevitable crash that much nastier. Nobody is making any money at the moment, which is what the whole thing is supposed to be about.

I would say keeping market share is what it's all about these days.

It's also worth noting that many bearish-on-production analysis I see either straight out or inadvertently compares boom-time full cycle costs with bust-time completion costs.  Every services company is getting the squeeze.  I'm not sure what your time line is for the inevitable crash, but every /CL bounce gives producers a chance to hedge a little higher, and a ton of the to be completed wells hedged on this forward curve are profitable.  [Again, market share is #1 at this point.](http://www.ogj.com/articles/2014/03/chevron-to-increase-production-maintain-capex-level-through-2017.html)

<TEXT> Some interesting research. Your article?

One thing I would point out which I didn't see addressed (correct me if I'm wrong).  The data is using average past well production.  E P are not drilling and completing marginal wells which are included in the average. They are completing the highest producing at lowest cost wells with the most efficient rigs, while retiring older, more costly ones.

[Also, interesting article from Platts last week.](http://blogs.platts.com/2015/03/20/tax-time-bakken-oil-summer/)

"Bakken production could suddenly skyrocket, by nearly 10%, or an additional 75,000 b/d, to 100,000 b/d in June, Helms said." This means that despite low prices and production curtailments throughout much of North America, oil production in North Dakota could actually shatter a new record this summer!

This is mainly due to a backlog of between 800 to 1,000 uncompleted wells statewide, about 125 of which need to be completed by the end of June in order to comply with state requirements to complete drilling within a year.

At the same time, operators may wait until June, when a major oil tax incentive known as the large trigger is expected to go into effect. The large trigger, which is aimed at boosting Bakken production at times of low crude prices, enters into force when the WTI crude price averages below $55.09/b for five consecutive months.

If that incentive is triggered, which Ryan Rauschenberger, North Dakotas tax commissioner, said he expects will happen, the majority of wells will be exempt from a 6.5% oil extraction tax for as long as two years.

With that tax break in effect and hundreds more wells running up against one-year state deadlines, production in North Dakota could continue to surge even beyond the summer." </TEXT>

[It is scientifically dishonest](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/17/patrick-moore/climate-change-skeptic-patrick-moore-says-earth-ha/), because it has warmed significantly over the past 16 years, 18 years, decades, century.  And the scientific body agrees that the abnormal warming is due to human's CO2 emissions. [Yet even when the deniers are called out for being scientifically dishonest, they keep repeating it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRCyctTvuCo list=PL82yk73N8eoX-Xobr_TfHsWPfAIyI7VAP index=21)  (This guy will debunk every argument you make, and sources it all). 

You are quite entertaining, in a sad sort of way.

<TEXT>  Barring any significant breakthroughs in substitutes for the energy services that oil and gas provides (e.g. transportation), or significant drops in total demand, most scenarios of the energy/climate system assume strong oil and gas consumption well into mid-century.

To add, if there were suddenly some amazing, unearthly breakthrough, it would be neither economical nor environmentally friendly to suddenly scrap hundreds of millions of cars.  Even with such a breakthrough, it would still take decades for vehicles currently being produced and in near term production to fully depreciate, as well as changing the incredibly complex gasoline and diesel infrastructure. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Contango is when the price for future delivery is higher than spot.  Since prices have to converge on contract expiry, either the spot price has to increase or the future month contracts have to decrease. Since USO isn't leveraged, either of these can happen so buying USO won't necessarily be bad long term, although there's a lot of literature on why you should never hold commodity ETFs long term.

Since UWTI is leveraged 3x, volatility or leverage decay can hurt you no matter which way you go, although there are some strategies using volatility decay.  Essentially a loss of 10% followed by a gain of 10% will leave the leveraged ETF down, while the underlying stays unchanged. There are some charts out there that show UWTI and Nymex WTI over the past few weeks where the futures contract is flat, and UWTI is down. </TEXT>

You are equating the population of the entire city with incredibly speculative, insanely government subsidized subdivisions based upon speculation, rather than actual demand - simply based upon the notion of *mass urbanization.*

Also, I had a friend with a (second) home in Thames Town, and if you think that speculative investment and second home buying are healthy for local economic development, you really need to reanalyze.

And 
Who wants to believe that China will overtake America economically in our lifetime?

Is just funny.  The issues China faces in the next few decades are serious.  The second the government lifts capital flight controls, the amount of money leaving will absolutely decimate the economy, which means that they can't, not to mention the environmental disaster that country is facing. </TEXT>

[Energy is heavy on the short side right now, check out the reports.](http://www.cftc.gov/MARKETREPORTS/COMMITMENTSOFTRADERS/INDEX.HTM) Another short squeeze and margin maintenance could certainly cause another spike.

<TEXT>  This is what I'm asking how you measure that?

I think entrepreneurship is a pretty solid measure, and South Korea typically ranks pretty low by global measures [like here,](http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2007/06/01/100049637/index.htm?postversion=2007060109) or [28th in GEDI](http://thegedi.org/countries), or [total early state entrepreneurs](http://www.gemconsortium.org/visualizations).

I also think that the top 30 Chaebols accounting for 80% of total S Korean GDP and have a huge amount of the population working for them is a pretty good measurement.  How would you?  Standardized tests as OP suggests?

And again, this all stemmed because OP called Korea's compulsory, publicly funded education system "free market," of which I asked for clarity.

I think extortion is a more accurate term.

You can think of it however the fuck you want, but when direct ballot initiatives for tax increases pass, there are a ton of people who don't agree.  When you spout that garbage you scare away people who might be swayed toward libertarian thought.  So if you aim is to circlejerk with a bunch of philosophizing fedoras, please continue.  But this kind of rhetoric will keep the libertarian movement a joke.

And I read your article, is it a parody?  You are saying in a privatized education system, the ones who can afford it would get filet mignon education, while the poor would get big macs.  I hope you are joking. And comparing retail to education, with complete different cost structures and end goals, is a terrible analogy.  Seriously, you should take that down, or at least don't ever show it to anyone who wants real ideas about how a privatized system would work.

Again, I'm not arguing for public education.  I'm simply saying that the arguments in this thread are written in the manner of a high schooler who just took his or her first introductory econ class. </TEXT>

I'm not arguing for public education, I'm saying that OP is arguing that the compulsory, publicly funded education system in Korea which produces highly rigid but not free thinking students is "free market" and better than our system because standardized math and science testing says so.

You've got the burden on the wrong side.

I was responding to this:

If the free market can successfully sell society refrigerators or washing machines, couldn't they do the same with education? This is why arguments that say 'free market education would be too expensive' fail.

There are plenty of arguments out there against privatizing education, of which, again, I am not arguing.  I'm simply saying OP is responding to exactly zero of those arguments out there.  People come here looking for free market solutions to our bloated government and failing systems, and they see this, written like a junior in high school who just read his first Ron Paul article.

Um.....  Please explain this "free market" education a little more.

You mention: 

The key to free market education is entrepreneurship.

Like the Korean education system is notorious for?  Working for a Chaebol is entrepreneurial right?  I know you are using entrepreneurial in a different manner here, but the "free market" education in Korea produces incredibly rigid students with little entrepreneurial spirit, while our terrible public system produces an incredible amount of entrepreneurs.

If the free market can successfully sell society refrigerators or washing machines, couldn't they do the same with education?

Not even sure what to do with this terrible argument.

This is why arguments that say 'free market education would be too expensive' fail.

You didn't address one single argument against getting rid of/privatizing the public education system, and 'free market education would be too expensive' is certainly not one.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  it is not profitable to go after new shale oil plays when oil is below at least $85/barrel.

There are plenty of shale plays that are profitable way below that level.

Therefore, in two or three years, we should expect to see US shale oil production evaporate.

Certainly smaller, over-leveraged players will go under and their bankruptcies will have some ripple effects through Wall Street and other financiers, but their assets will be bought up for cheap by the better financed. The technology is to the point where the lead times for many of the wells to be drilled is a few months, which is a huge difference from traditional production.

Shale oil companies couldn't turn a profit when oil was $110/barrel

Tons were turning profits on wells, they were cash flow flat or negative because they were investing in new production.

I expect to see oil climb much higher than where it's been.

Sorry, not with you there. Demand is flat, alternatives becoming bigger, production might dip some but lead times are much quicker to respond to increases. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Denver Rescue Mission is right downtown and recently expanded operations.  My sister-in-law lives down the street and bikes by it to work.  Since they expanded, the homeless population in the area exploded, and there's typically a few hundred yard line of homeless people to use their services. When they are done, they roam the streets, harass people, sleep and shit in her backyard, all sorts of fun stuff.  She has to take a much longer bike route to and from work if she doesn't want to be harassed.

The stories of places banning feeding the homeless come from stories like this.  It's easy to sit back and say the terrible government is arresting poor little 90-year-olds, but when you have homeless people shitting in your backyard you understand the sentiment.

And what is the libertarian solution?  If land is all privatized, they will be welcome nowhere, correct? </TEXT>

<TEXT> You'll likely only get responses from conservative folks either denying AGW, saying it's not that big a deal and climate change is natural, or saying that it should stem from the consumers, i.e. if enough people "believe" in it, they will buy priuses, the latter two being deniers as well but trying to mask it.  I'm guessing you are not in those camps because you are asking the question.

My answer:  it won't.  This is a question that is brought up a lot here, and I've yet to see a solid answer to how it will work in a libertarian society of any sort.  I truly believe the only way to actually combat AGW is to price it into the market, and let the free market solve the problem.  But this of course requires some sort of force to achieve this.  

That being said, there are ways to price carbon into the market that will be a net benefit for the poor, with a larger share (really not much) falling on the upper classes who tend to be those who are so concerned about AGW (the "hollywood elite"), all while preserving freedom .

So, good luck getting an answer, I've been looking for a while and yet to find anything.  Have had some fun arguments though. </TEXT>

 I would put money on one of them being dead in 2.

So wouldn't this be a great time to loosen the embargo?  Open them up to outside thought so that when the regime change does come, the people will have more insight into the outside would and the wonders of trade and capitalism, and be less willing to put up with a horrible dictatorship?

 Even in the 90's Havana was set up as a show town for European tourists, with a lively and vibrant area for them to see and talk about to their friends, surrounded by slums that tourists never saw. I imagine its the same now.

And now this will be more transparent to the outside world, especially Americans.  Foreign NGOs and companies will be able to design plans to help the people in slums while potentially profiting.  Likely USAID will be banned, but CGI, Gates foundation love taking on these problems.

If you just object to an embargo for its own sake

I think most people here are against embargoes for their its sake *because they don't work.*  They simply do not hurt those in charge and bring the people out of poverty. </TEXT>

Such ignorance.*  I've been all around these regions and never heard it used.

These may be examples of stateless areas, but primarily because they were fleeing persecution and death, not taxes.  The whole area of China is now integrated into the Chinese system because of prosperity.  Parents are trying to send their kids to schools in the cities for their future.  I knew a Naxi girl from a tiny village who moved to Lijiang to go to school and became a kindergarten teacher.  She said she would never move back.  I have tons of stories from many of these small villages and minorities.

<TEXT> 1) So you argue that the NM lottery gives money to scholarships, but then accept my 'fungible' argument that equivalent money can be easily pulled out of education budgets.

I'll look up Jon Oliver's argument when not at work.  But I don't think in all cases the funds being diverted argument holds true, but haven't studied the empirical data much. 

 2) Well, if the lotteries are privatized, they won't be able to lie to consumers (as State ones can)

The lying you are talking about is saying that the funding isn't going education?  I'm not sure if I consider that lying, as they are audited and 100% of the net funds go to a scholarship fund. 

creating a net improvement

Explain this a little more.  

All I'm saying is that you are arguing that exploiting of poor people should be privatized so that profits can go to private companies instead of scholarships because, according to you, the government is lying - many would argue against this.

I have no idea where you get this notion from.  Seriously, where do you get this from?  There is mountains of evidence.  That's what all the science is about.  The science builds and builds on each topic.  One counterpoint is brought up, and counter research proves/disproves it.  All this builds to an equation, vastly simplified of:

Total warming increase = Warming from human caused CO2 emissions + warming from non-human CO2 + warming from solar activity + warming from all other significant factors

They then run massive analysis, controlling for these other factors and come to the scientific conclusion that: Abnormal warming increase = Warming from human caused CO2 emissions.

Sticking your fingers in your ears and saying lalalalala does not mean there's no evidence.

let alone that it should be cause for concern.

The doomsday talk takes it too far, but the cost benefit analysis of current action for future returns sways towards action now.  The cities on the coast, the destruction of coral reefs affecting vast amounts of ocean ecosystem from increased temps and acidification, huge feedback mechanisms from decreasing libido and what I mentioned before.

<TEXT> From evidence. The Earth has been much hotter than it is now

Again, zero understanding of the science.

Of course not. I suppose you do?

Nope, I listen to the experts who do, and their peers who rigorously study and confirm or deny the published research.  And before you start with the liberal and AGW bias of academia, do you know the ungodly amounts of money available for someone who can legitimately disprove AGW?  Scientists say they aren't in it for the money, but I find it hard to imagine at least one scientist who wouldn't love to be filthy rich.

In choosing between models and evidence, I choose evidence.

The research and models are based off of evidence, and real evidence, not your, "Well this one time in Earth's history it was hotter therefor AGW is wrong."  All the items listed above are factors in the research, and the evidence shows that none of them are responsible for the recent warming.

[Do the Earths volcanoes emit more CO2 than human activities? Research findings indicate that the answer to this frequently asked question is a clear and unequivocal, No.](http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/hazards/gas/climate.php)

<TEXT> Oil futures are the most leveraged instrument retail investors can use (correct me if you know of more).  1 contract of front month WTI has a margin requirement of around $3,000 for a delivery of 1,000 barrels of oil. That means your $3,000 controls $75,000 worth of underlying at current prices, a 4% leverage ratio.  Longer dated contracts have closer to $1,000 margin requirements.

If you were long from $100 to the current $75, you would have lost $25,000 per contract.  Plus margin calls.  This guy has no idea what he's talking about throughout this thread, but he's right that futures are fucking rough.

The ETFs are more for investors looking to diversify their assets classes, taking out a huge amount of the leverage and risk while still keeping the correlation to physical oil. </TEXT>

When broadband came around, the big guys lobbied for the FCC not to classify broadband under title II - although it's the exact same as dial up, and it has been nothing but consolidation and destruction of competition since then. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Selling illegal weed requires you to find customers through black market channels.  If you don't already have a pretty solid network, you will have little chance of making more than some pocket change.  There are tons of black market dealers.  On the other hand, you start a dispensary and do small amounts of marketing and can get pretty good foot traffic (although I don't think many more licenses are being granted).

I have friends here that sell illegal wholesale, and are constantly worried about getting robbed.  All dispensaries and grow operations are hooked up to CC cameras and the police station. While carrying large amounts of cash is certainly risk, there is much less risk in running a legal dispensary.

Taxes are a part of the reason, but really more of a scapegoat.  The main reason, in Colorado at least, is requiring dispensaries to to grow 70% of what they sell, which is no longer the case as of October this year.  Companies will now be able to focus on one aspect of the supply chain, and prices are projected to drop next year.  

Finally, Colorado dispensaries are incredibly profitable, even with the tax rate this high.  They will likely keep similar margins as prices drop, bringing more people from the black market. </TEXT>

<TEXT> At this point, it almost exclusively depends on how cold the winter is, with some other minor power generation demand effects with low coal stocks. (I'm speaking to NG futures, but I believe the UNG buys futures, correct me if I'm wrong I know some commodity ETFs do weird things)

The move yesterday was due to the polar vortex forecast, overcoming the huge injection of 91bcf, beating analysts average of 87bcf.  [Stocks are still 6.8% below the 5-year average](http://ir.eia.gov/ngs/ngs.html), but same year injections last year were around 40bcf. The supply increase in definitely not slowing, but injections are projected to turn to withdrawals third week of November.

So bottom line, if it's a really cold winter, yes, it will continue to rise.  If it's a really warm winter, it will not rise as much and could fall.  I'm fairly certain it will be in between those 2, and I personally am trading with a long bias. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's so much competing information out there. The analysts I trust say cost of production for most shale plays is 60-80, but many of the firms are also somewhat hedged through 2015.  The Canadian tar sands are typically over 80, which is funny because of Keystone XL.

IMHO Venezuela will collapse with the lower prices sending a supply shock and rebounding prices before the aggregate US production collapses. There will certainly be some smaller producers and some more expensive plays put on hold or going under, but they will just get scooped up by better capitalized firms. 

The Saudis are betting on state run oil over the insanely innovative US private producers, and (relatively) free market forces.  I know where I would put my money. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Oil/USD is a smaller number when USD is higher

Are you saying USD/basket of currencies?

If USD doubles (strengthens?) tomorrow, the USD oil price would go down 50% and stay the same in non-USD terms

This would mean a perfectly negative correlation with every other currency in the world, which is mathematically impossible unless they are all perfectly positively correlated.

My equation above is a simplified version of the exact effect that happens when:

Sinopec is buying Arab Extra Light from the Saudis, Sinopec converts RMB to USD, the Saudis do the same, and then transact in USD. Could you explain in that equation where your effect takes place? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's different for each country and how much the dollar strengthened against respective currencies, but for many (prob most) it's actually cheaper with prices this low and a strong dollar than higher prices and weaker dollar.  Also note foreign oil is priced against Brent or another benchmark rather than against the WTI contract. 

The strengthening dollar was really larger culprit for decreased demand when WTI was still around 90, brent around 95.  The main reasons for prices this low and the continued drop are the US shale boom and the Saudis dumping oil to try to put the US producers out of business on the supply side, and no where for it to go with decreased demand in the US and the slowdown in China and eurozone.  </TEXT>

As far as natural gas vehicles go, the decreased demand through increased natural gas usage is inconsequential, and the countries with the highest natural gas vehicle fleets are either very low demand on the gasoline and diesel front to begin with, or have increasing demand for gasoline and diesel as well.

<TEXT> It's the exact opposite actually.  Oil is traded on the world market in dollars, which means that countries have to convert local currency to dollars to buy in the global markets.  When the dollar is strengthening it makes oil more expensive, thus decreasing demand.

For example, for simple purposes let's say the exchange rate for a country is 100 currencies to $1. The means the can buy one barrel of WTI for $80 * 100/$1 = 8000 currencies.

Tomorrow, the dollar strengthens to to 101 to $1.  You now buy one barrel of WTI for $80 * 101/$1 = 8080 currencies.

Hope that wasn't too simple and I am being a dick. </TEXT>

The Saudis aren't doing this to break Iran, they are doing it to break the US shale boom. That's why they discounted prices to US buyers and increased to Asia. The geopolitical issues are smoke and mirrors, the Saudis don't want to lose market share to the US boom.

US is not happy because production costs for many of the shale plays are in the 60-80 range, and presents huge financial challenges for under-capitalized, typically smaller players.  </TEXT>

"This doesnt happen in a vacuum, though."

Followed by his conclusions based on assumptions in a vacuum, specifically:

"This effect is exacerbated by the fact that the excess supply of money incentivizes producers to restrict production causing a leftward shift in the supply curve"


 I don't think the point was that deflation is always positive, only that it does not always lead to depression or even an economic downturn. Deflationary spirals can certainly occur, but that does not mean that we ought to shy away from all deflation to the point of trying to ensure inflation, in the same way that the possibility of hyperinflation does not mean we should intentionally cause deflation.

But his point is certainly *not all deflation is bad* citing the beginning of US  industrialization in the 1880s - deflation caused through productivity increases - as an example, which is a terribly misleading comparison which absolutely has no relevance to current deflation fears. And then he doesn't give any other examples of positive deflation, well, because.... </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is, therefore, no general benefit to inflationary policies.

"I used these vague economic terms and a basic supply and demand charts, combined with disconnected logic to prove my economic theory true!"

To many people, deflation is synonymous with economic downturn and depression, but history contradicts this fear: from 1880-1886 prices fell by an average of 1.75% while real income rose 5% in the same period. 

He's really using the 1880's as an example of positive effects of deflation?  That period has close to zero effective comparisons to our modern economic situation and deflation.

<TEXT> [Shell accepts the science as well](http://www.shell.com/global/future-energy/scenarios/2050.html), and has two global projection scenarios.  

1) "Scramble" with flight into coal and rapidly growing CO2 emissions. The video they give is incredibly gloomy.

2) "Blueprints" is one with worldwide emission trading and evolving post-Kyoto with emerging coalitions and strong green energy growth. The video they created is a future with nature and happy people enjoying their lives.

It's funny, the only people denying the science are.... Fox News and WSJ opinion/comment section?

<TEXT> In addition to others in the thread about international prospects, many wells in the US which were previously deemed dead are being re-drilled and yielding more than the original well. There is so much more increase in production to be had in the next years domestically. Technologies are advancing so quickly, and firms are talking about 10%+ recovery rates.

If you look at EIA charts from 2010-2011, the forecasts are a sharp increase for the following year, then flattening out. Every year. So the actuals are a very steep curve.  [This article is a really good read about increased production and demand for technology.](http://fuelfix.com/blog/2014/08/06/pioneer-ceo-us-oil-production-could-hit-14-million-barrelsday/) I'll try to find the chart he made with the prediction.

<TEXT> Let's take my previous example and compare it to this one.

The Wapichan, who live in southern Guyana, have just completed a high-resolution map of their traditional lands to justify their claim for legal title. They want 14,000 square kilometres to be protected as a community forest.

My local city government (chosen by locals) a long time ago decided it wanted to make a specific area a community forest-like greenbelt, so they are prohibiting excessive development on specific plots of land. There are certainly people who disagree with this, as I'm sure there are with the tribes in the Wapichan people.

There isn't much more about the group in this article, but I imagine there are so many similarities between the two.  To your point below, I believe it's the exact opposite - these two groups have so many similarities, but the one that's called government is berated in this sub as horrible institutions destroying other people's rights, simply because it's called government. And these "common resource pools" are heralded and champions of non-government, simply because they aren't called government, while in all reality they behave much like what is called a local government. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Legitimate question:

What do you think would have happened if the US were an ancap society during WWII?  

Japan's attacks were certainly a response to Western imperialism, but the Nanjing Massacre happened starting in 1937, and similar atrocities happened throughout the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere areas that Japan invaded, way before the US imposed any sanctions. Why would they have stopped in Nanjing? You don't think they would have swept across all of China as well as SE Asia, killing, torturing, and enslaving way more than 36 million?  After that, they wouldn't come towards the US?

I guess my question comes down to how does an ancap society deal with a world that is anything but? </TEXT>

I think environment is one of those dividing points with libertarians. Where I grew up, there is an amazingly beautiful, huge swath of land up for sale right up against mountains. Without a doubt, if sold on the free market a large developer would come in a develop the shit out of the land, ruining the natural beauty of a large portion of the city (a drunk professor showed us offers). So the local government set permit restrictions to 2 structure developments on the land. Is this wrong? Clearly the locals don't think so, or they would have found a way to restructure the local government and bring in more free market advocates. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [I highly recommend this Planet Money](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/06/28/196355493/economists-have-a-one-page-solution-to-climate-change) on how a carbon tax would work, and essentially cost nothing for an average energy user.

This podcast proposes a tax on carbon, returning that money as an offsetting reduction in income tax. The income tax reduction would be set to the average of all carbon use, so highly efficient users would save a little money, and heavy carbon users would lose a little bit of money.

Taxes are disincentives, so putting a tax on carbon would create incentives for individuals to reduce energy use, and would put alternative energies in a price competitive position with fossil fuels.

There are small government libertarians out there who believe that one of the few roles of government is macro-environmental protection, and I think this is a very positive solution. </TEXT>

<TEXT> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Chinese_Famine

Drought, poor weather, and the policies of the Communist Party of China contributed to the famine, although the relative weights of the contributions are disputed due to the Great Leap Forward.

Great Leap Forward policies meaning local communist cadres wanted to impress the central government so they over-reported local yields, meaning that they had excess and the excess was shipped away, creating local famines, exacerbated by extreme weather.  You should research the Great Leap Forward.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Famines_in_Africa

The region I'm working with in Africa, the main issues for yields are nonexistence of irrigation and reliance on rainfall, as well as aflatoxin. This is primarily post-harvest issue that can be prevented by proper drying and storage, as well as some fumigation which is much less damaging than spraying fields. 

In the US, advanced irrigation is what prevented famine, and there have certainly been some more localized famine issues, such as the dust bowl.  

I'm saying that the pesticides are doing harm to our natural ecosystem and the effects will be long term, with some effects already showing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not agreeing with the article by any means, but I personally believe that in long term we will learn that the rampant use of glyphosate and neonicotinoids,  as well as overuse of  chemical fertilizers will not prove a negative contribution, primarily through destruction of biodiversity especially within species necessary for our agricultural production.

There are so many people in the middle of the GMOs are nazis, and the hive mind that is presented within /r/conspiratard of the world would not survive without GMOs, which is bullshit.

I replied this a little bit back when the cracked.com article was posted, a few rational issues I bring up:

[Hypoxic dead zones cause by fertilizer run off](http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/deadzone.html)

[Destroying biodiversity, the cornerstone of our existence and development](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001456)

The devastating effect of neonicitinoids on bees, worms, butterflies, birds, and other creatures necessary to humans (still definitive causal linkage needed, but before conclusive evidence, the populations will be decimated).

Finally, and the most prevalent: the ideology that the human race cannot survive without GMOs and chemicals. This angers me more than any of the harmful effects listed above. I have done ag work in China, India, and currently doing a project in Africa, which is still on the edge of GMO introduction and artificial fertilizer. One of our partners there is the only official Monsonta dealer at the moment, and I can't really say anything to them.

This ideology is complete bullshit put forth by industry to justify harmful ag techniques.

China had the most advanced organic farming techniques in the world, and all this development was thrown out the window for short term, marginal increases in production. These farms who switched are now addicted to fertilizer, and take 3-4 years to bring soil back to self-sustaining organic levels, which puts any small farmer out of business.

It's a shame because Africa still has these natural techniques, but will soon be switching and likely will never be able to go back.

Edit: To the ideology of the world won't survive using primarily organic:

<TEXT> To put contracts for 126 tonnes of gold into perspective, the Comex is currently reporting that 27 tonnes of actual physical gold are classified as being available for deliver should the buyers of futures contracts want delivery. But the buyers are the banks themselves who wont be taking delivery.

This is how futures markets work... Speculators provide liquidity and will never take delivery. Futures 101. Gold is unique in its role in commodity trading, but volume and open interest in futures contracts always exceeds deliverable amounts.

The big hedge funds primarily trade gold futures using **computers** and algorithm programs.

Computers, yes. Primarily algorithms, no. Algorithms factor into some hedge funds strategies, but saying *primarily* is bullshit.

The banks use the selling from the hedge funds to cover the short positions theyve amassed and book trading profits as they cover their short positions at price levels that are below the prices at which their short positions were established. 

So, the hedge funds take huge potential losses so that the banks can cover their short positions? If their positions are that significant to make a profit, the market moves back the other way.

The thing about futures contracts is there is one pool of liquidity - either CME or ICE. With equities, if you want to get rid of a large position, you spread your trades across venues. You can't do this with futures. If you want to close a position, you can only do that through one single exchange. Maybe a large player was on the fence and wanted to exit their position because the completely unwarranted run on gold filled their coffers, and they believed that *after* Yellen was done speaking, people would make moves and it would be too late.

And, to end it:

The only explanation for this is that the Government is complicit in the price suppression and manipulation of gold and silver and welcomes the insider trading that helps to achieve this result.

Lol.  Another prime example of /r/libertarian 's naivety of finance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It will be a long, long time before the dollar is overturned as the world currency reserves, but I'm not sure what you're forever timeline is.

Or commodities like generics like soybeans ... Do they go up or down in dollars?

All the major ag futures contracts are priced in dollars, and global physical trade is generally priced in dollars.

Do south American companies seem more likely to relatively succed if say a BRIC currency emerges as a strong world reserve?

No matter the growth you see in these counties, and your personal negative view of the US, look at the protectionist policies in these countries, the political uncertainty, and the ability to enforce a contract as a foreigner.

As an aside, China is an interesting case with currency manipulation.  On the one hand, the PBOC controls the exchange rate, bringing accusations of undervalued currency, but there are plenty of studies that say if China releases capital controls for RMB leaving the country, there will be huge capital flight and the yuan will tank.  Having lived in China for a long time, there is zero trust in the yuan or government.

The other three countries are laughable as a currency reserve.

Doesurope win or lose overall if the US dollar collapses leaving the USA unable to support or defend Europe if it still does anyway.

The only other real candidate is from Europe. 

If this is from a practical purpose, if you try to time the collapse of the $ as a currency reserve, you will lose. I will guarantee that. </TEXT>

Not sure what kind of university you went to and taught at then, and I am assuming you were getting your masters, which means you were a very low level teacher.

<TEXT> Are you seriously saying that the school's profit = revenue of students - variable cost of teacher?

Even if you exclude the administrative overhead, necessary or not, there are other huge considerations such as depreciating capital expenditures.  If you think that your $3,500 salary is even a small portion of the total costs of running a class, you are seriously mistaken.

Now adding back in administrative costs, would you as an individual be able to handle scheduling of the building, front to end email contact with students, reporting, and everything else that goes into what you consider unnecessary administrative costs.

As someone who has seen the back end of the processes, I think you are overinflating your individual roll in the university. Are there ways to cut down on that overhead?  Of course, but the efficiencies of running it as a business would simply put more responsibility on you and everyone else in the system without increasing your pay. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Are you talking futures, physicals, or production and processing companies?  

If futures, Brent or WTI? 

One major driver is the US export restriction of crude, which has recently been tested with the commerce department allowing two companies to export minimally processed ultralight. The government has said there will not be any complete repeal of the ban on crude exports this year, but could be very possible to some extent next year.  When this happens, the Brent-WTI spread will likely narrow, and American refineries' margins will decrease while producers margins will increase.

As for the ME being a mess, Iraq is at record production and projected to increase. Libya is set to pick up production, and Iran's nuclear talks are moving forward. The Israel Palestine at the moment is really more of a sentiment issue than an actual production issue, unless it drags the region into a war, which isn't unlikely.

Depending on what happens with the the downed plane could bring serious energy sanctions to Russia, a major producer of both.

My opinion is that production will continue to increase and NG and CL prices will stay within similar seasonal swings at current levels, refiner margins will decrease, and production companies will have another strong year (don't know where they are priced and if this is priced in).

<TEXT> I guess we are getting a little closer here.

We have eminent domain and "massive amounts of federal funds."

But give me a specific game plan.  Just immediately repeal all laws pertaining to ISPs? Any other specific ones? It's nice to say *government get the fuck out*, but we live in a real world and this is just talk, not an actual game plan.

On the contrary, forcing monopoly ISPs to lease lines to other ISPs has empirical evidence of actually producing the wanted results, and a strategy we can follow. I'm not saying this is the way to go, but so often I see the attitude of *get the government out of X* without having any sort of A to B strategy, or any contingency plans. It's cute talking about philosophy and all, but if you really want to get anything done you have to provide more than that attitude. 

Government caused this problem, so it can only fix it by getting the fuck out.
 
Empirical evidence proves this statement patently false. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The thing is that [regulation forcing competition worked in the UK](http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/28/why-is-european-broadband-faster-and-cheaper-blame-the-governme/), and most European nations which have stronger regulations have much faster, cheaper internet.

I agree that more competition through less regulation would be better, but I haven't seen a good game plan on how to roll it out, it's all just "let them duke it out in the free market" talk. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So when the market is dead quiet, you can't get matched up to orders sitting on the market because someone does some trickery with them. Ok?

The legal issue that the class action lawsuit alleges is that the exchanges breached contracts to provide legitimate market information.

How is this any worse than bid-ask spreads, commissions, and other stupid shit we already deal with in the market? 

These are explicitly stated and agreed upon.

Moreover, in every single discussion I've had, no one can definitively prove that the HFT dudes can actually consistently 'steal' from you using these methods.

That's what they are trying to bring to light with the lawsuit.  I would really like to see this exact experiment done with a market order.  My guess of what you would see is the HFT trade would be filled first, the book would walk, and the same HFT trade would then fill your order as the price moved up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This comment will probably be buried, but I think it's very interesting that the GMO debate is thrown into the whole conspiracy debate.  I think there is just as much hive mind behind the "conspiratard" aspect of the GMO debate as to anti-GMO

I know some people take the GMO to the level of giving kids autism, diseases, whatever, but I believe there is legitimate argument to the anti-GMO movement, just not those who get the stage.  Full disclosure: my family owns a small to medium sized farm and we do organic agronomy education in our region.

The main, *real* arguments against GMO products is that they promote an unstudied, harmful manner of harvesting crops. Because GMOs promote the use and overuse of fertilizer and pesticide, they give short term benefits for unknown medium and long term harms.

Some major issues for me:

[Hypoxic dead zones cause by fertilizer run off](http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/deadzone.html)

[Destroying biodiversity, the cornerstone of our existence](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001456)

The devastating effect of neonicitinoids on bees, worms, butterflies, birds, and other creatures necessary to humans (still definitive causal linkage needed, but before conclusive evidence, the populations will be decimated).

Finally, and the most prevalent: the ideology that the human race cannot survive without GMOs and chemicals. This angers me more than any of the harmful effects listed above. I have done ag work in China, India, and currently doing a project in Africa, which is still on the edge of GMO introduction and artificial fertilizer. This ideology is complete bullshit put forth by industry to justify harmful ag techniques.

China had the most advanced organic farming techniques in the world, and all this development was thrown out the window for short term, marginal increases in production. These farms who switched are now addicted to fertilizer, and take 3-4 years to bring soil back to self-sustaining organic levels, which puts any small farmer out of business. 

It's a shame because Africa still has these natural techniques, but will soon be switching and likely will never be able to go back.

So while Sandy Hook "deniers" should be ashamed of their ignorance, other sides should do research as well before jumping to conclusions.

<TEXT> Except many believe the climate is not continuing to warm (see above) and that there has been no significant warming for 17 years (see more at climatedepot.com).

Debunked.

The global warmers are the ones refusing to discuss, debate or even mention the growing body of science questioning and in increasing instances disproving their theories

This is just silly.

 They also mostly ignore news of manipulated climate models and the serious concerns of scientists who no longer believe the climate is changing significantly.

There are no manipulated models. Again, debunked.

Denying anthropomorphic climate change makes you look incredibly foolish and anti-science. Please take this bullshit to climate skeptic and conservative subs.  If you present a well respected scientific article saying that increasing energy costs now will stifle future technologies to deal with carbon in the future, well that's something that we could talk about. Posting this spam makes you look dumb.

<TEXT> The fracking industry is an interesting study into environmental concerns and regulation. There was an article in the [WSJ energy report](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304831304579544092287190238?mg=reno64-wsj) from this morning (if you get the paywall, copy the title, open a new tab google the title).  

Regulations are lagging way behind fracking development, but firms are cutting emissions and reducing environmental damage by developing new technologies. Companies are also setting up websites to get information about fracking and attempting to set up industry safety standards before government can come in a regulate the hell out of production. But my question is: are these initiatives at least in part response to the threat of regulation? Would the rush to reduce emissions and set standards be there without that threat?

I also think it's a stretch with the correlation between regulations and start-ups going out of business. The four industries she mentioned are hugely capital intensive and firms in those industries are much more likely to run into cash flow issues than say a software firm (which also have high failure rates). </TEXT>

I've backpacked all over Yosemite and Glacier, high bear activity areas, with nothing more than a bear bell with no problems.

<TEXT> Thanks to [u/writergeek](http://www.reddit.com/user/writergeek) for the inspiration in [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/1wxf0g/sticky_spicy_sweet_asian_bbq_ribs/). I saw this in the morning and my mouth started watering, so I started what I had in the fridge and pantry.

**Pork and Sauce:**

2.5 lbs. pork shoulder

 yellow onion, chopped

4 garlic cloves, minced

1-inch fresh ginger 

 cup brown sugar

 cup honey or agave nectar

 cup soy sauce

 sriracha

3 tablespoons white vinegar

3 tablespoons black Chinese vinegar

3 tablespoons sweet chili sauce

1 teaspoon salt

Freshly ground black pepper, to taste



Add all sauce ingredients in slow cooker and set to low. Let onions, garlic, and ginger release a little flavor. Add meat and cook on low 6-8 hours. Remove meat and shred. Mix 2 tablespoons water with 1 tablespoon corn starch. Pour into the sauce and stir until it thickens. I poured the sauce over each taco, but you can add back to the pork once you pull it. With 2.5 lbs. pork, this recipe will make it very saucy.

I added 3 finely ground Sichuan peppers kernels as well. They give a nice mild numbing flavor that goes really well with the sweet and spicy. You can probably find these in an Asian market. 



**Slaw:**
I used Alton Browns [Recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/asian-slaw-recipe.html) as a guide, then added and removed a few items.

1 (3-inch) piece ginger, grated fine 

 cup rice wine vinegar

1 tablespoon soy sauce 

1 lime, juiced 

2 tablespoons sesame oil 

2 tablespoons sesame seeds

 head Napa cabbage, sliced thin 

 red bell pepper, julienne fine 

 yellow bell pepper, julienne fine 

1 Serrano chile, minced fine

1 large carrot, grated fine with a peeler 

3 green onions, cut on the bias, all of white part and half of the green 

2 tablespoons cilantro 

 teaspoon ground black pepper



Chop all veggies in large bowl. Mix sauce ingredients in small bowl. Add to desired sauciness.

**Finishing**
Heat mini corn tacos in oven until warm. Garnish with lime, cilantro and crispy chow mein.

<TITLE> Mitch McConnell Asks Defense Industry to Back Republicans Who Will Protect Military Spending </TITLE>

<TEXT> [GOP Incumbents Lean on Donors to Beat Back Primary Foes](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304173704579260133964574284)

Text from article:

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell recently delivered a direct pitch to one of America's top defense contractors: Get off the sidelines and start backing Republicans who will protect military spending.

Mr. McConnell's message, according to people who attended a Nov. 6 fundraiser with officials from BAE Systems Inc., was that if Republican lawmakers lose primary elections from challengers further to their right who have few qualms about trimming military budgets, the defense industry could expect dwindling support in Washington.

"In the current debate, spending cuts have trumped robust national-security spending," said one person at the McConnell fundraiser, held at a Capitol Hill townhouse. "The main message he was pushing was: Get involved, mainly to teach those who are primarying incumbents that it is not helpful to run against incumbents who are champions for the industry."
The Kentucky Republican's outreach to the defense community is part of an effort by party leaders to blunt the effects of conservatives who are stepping up in increasing numbers to challenge GOP incumbents. Many of the 12 Senate Republicans up for re-election next year are facing primary challengers aligned with the tea party, including Mr. McConnell.

In the House, Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) also has moved to undermine the power of the tea party, saying that groups supporting the movement had lost credibility in policy debates and accusing them of forcing GOP lawmakers to take ill-advised policy positions. That was a reference to the federal-government shutdown of October, which the public blamed largely on the Republican Party.

On Sunday, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) noted Mr. Boehner's frustration and said, "I was frustrated, too." But he also said on NBC that the tea party represents "very important elements of our conservative family, and I would prefer to keep those conversations within the family."

The effort to beat back challenges from the right goes beyond the defense industry. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups have been stepping in to help business-friendly Republicans aligned with the GOP leadership, a reaction to the government shutdown in October, which the business groups opposed, and a sign of worries that tea party-aligned candidates might try to eliminate tax breaks and spending favored by businesses.

Mr. McConnell delivered his message at the fundraiser hours after a candidate backed by a number of GOP leaders in Washington, and the Chamber of Commerce, beat a more conservative challenger in a special congressional election in Alabama.

According to campaign-finance records, BAE Systems, a U.S. unit of U.K.-based BAE Systems PLC that works on such items as the F-35 jet fighter and the Bradley fighting vehicle, has given Mr. McConnell $5,000 so far this year, the maximum allowed, to help him beat back a 2014 challenge from tea-party ally Matt Bevin.
BAE, which has a large presence in Kentucky, declined to comment on the fundraiser or its discussions with Mr. McConnell.
"Our political action committee's contributions reflect our support for candidates who believe in strong national security and defense and represent districts where BAE Systems is a part of the local community," said spokesman Brian Roehrkasse.
Mr. McConnell's Senate office referred questions to his 2014 re-election campaign. Josh Holmes, a senior adviser to the McConnell campaign, defended the senator's appeal. "Sen. McConnell is a conservative who believes in a strong national defense and wants to ensure that those who share his opinion aren't silenced by a reluctance to voice their opinion in elections," he said.

The message appears to be rippling through the defense industry, where officials are voicing increasing resentment with tea party-aligned Republicans.

"There's definitely frustration within the defense community, and the frustration goes to tea partiers who are emphasizing cuts without internalizing the harm," said Roger Zakheim, an attorney at Covington   Burling LLP who served until October as general counsel for the House Armed Services Committee. "At times, our respective leaders in both branches have essentially allowed, and continue to allow, the military to be a pawn in the greater debate."

Mr. McConnell's pitch to the defense industry is a delicate one. As Senate Republican leader, he has supported sequestration, the across-the-board spending cuts that have hit domestic programs and the Defense Department.

Matt Hoskins, executive director of the Senate Conservatives Fund, a political-action committee backing Mr. McConnell's GOP challenger, called Mr. McConnell a hypocrite for casting himself as a defender of military spending while supporting the spending cuts. "All he's really doing is saying 'nudge-nudge, wink-wink, you know I'm a big spender, you know I'll take care of you,' " he said.

"What he's really saying is that he's a big spending Republican who will take care of these special interests if they help him in the primary," Mr. Hoskins said. "It's, you scratch my back, I will scratch your back."

In Georgia, Lockheed Martin Corp., General Dynamics Corp. and Boeing Co. have already stepped in to support Rep. Jack Kingston, who is battling Rep. Paul Broun and others in the GOP primary for retiring Sen. Saxby Chambliss's Senate seat. Mr. Kingston, who has faced accusations from the right that he is insufficiently committed to eliminating the president's health-care law, has collected at least $60,000 from defense firms for his campaign, according to finance records, making him a top recipient of defense industry dollars in the current campaign cycle.

In addition to BAE's contribution, Mr. McConnell has drawn donations from Lockheed Martin and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc., which have each donated $2,500 to his campaign, records show. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This thread is hilarious.

OP: Our theory says that the private market can take care of the poorer citizens. Let's brainstorm some ideas of how to help homelessness in NYC!

Responses: 
1) These kids don't even know who their dad is.
2) I'm looking out for my kids, the parent should put their kids up for adoption.
3) Stupid statists would never help their own people.
4) It's government policy through local zoning barriers that's really keeping them homeless.

I'm all for libertarian ideas to help our society, but I have to say that many self-proclaiming libertarians out there are just as big of liars as the current politicians and have no idea how the real world works.

Edit: And now to add to number 2: Or let them starve. Just don't make them my responsibility.

OP - it's naively cute of you to think that many libertarians hold this dear to them, I'm afraid you are likely in the minority, although there are others out there like you. 

I have one suggestion. Check out one of these foodbanks: [Feeding America Network](http://feedingamerica.org/foodbank-results.aspx?state=NY#)

I work with one of the local food banks, we give out over 12 million meals a year. Feeding America is an amazing organization that has deals with major grocery and distribution chains and does great work. They certainly have programs helping the homeless in NYC. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not disagreeing with your assessment of the effective vs. tax level.

But your idea that that all companies manufacture abroad for tax purposes in itself contradicts your earlier statements. A huge amount of small businesses manufacture in China for one reason: price. The price is so cheap because of labor prices, Chinese government investments and incentives, and the manufacturing and transportation infrastructure. 

As you said above, none of the SME receive any of the tax benefits of hiding profits abroad, so why are they manufacturing in China? </TEXT>

Did you actually read the article? What he is suggesting is that the most important aspect of creating jobs is a healthy economic environment and demand. If you have any experience from an entrepreneurial or VC viewpoint, you know that is completely true. Tax rates can be zero, but if there is no demand there will be no new investment, new companies formed, and new jobs.

Aside from the catch phrase of *rich people don't create jobs* (which the author says isn't exactly the case), what exactly about this article don't you agree with?

1) This guy is a dick and asking the same bullshit buzzword neo-con questions. Check out his channel and tell me if you think he is really Libertarian. To me, he seems to be pushing the same neo-con agenda.

2) Is he asking for personal experience or "good for the nation?" He blends the questions to try to *gotcha* people.

3) He frames the questions in the manner of "Have you told your parents you're gay yet?"

What a bunch of joke interviews. Plus the way he keeps looking at the camera. I wouldn't be surprised if he talked to some people actually knew what they were talking about but didn't give airtime because they knew what they were talking about. Go to the middle of some rural town and ask them about the ACA.

So, as a Liberal* what do I think of Obamacare so far?
*Disclaimer: I don't consider myself a "liberal" as this interviewer is trying to label.

Personal Experience:  I was dropped from my parents' health plan while in school and couldn't afford a private one (~150/month more for catastrophic). I was allowed to get back on in the early days of the ACA. I'm now on my wife's company plan. They have an amazing plan and prices actually went down since the ACA went into effect. There is no one close to me who was dropped from insurance. The exchange in Colorado worked well from the get-go with a few early connection errors/too many hits. I signed up for the Connect for Health Colorado and plans were much cheaper than before, but my wife works for a European company so health insurance is a large part of her benefit package. Health insurance companies now advertise regularly on TV encouraging competition, which never happened before. My parents combined will be saving around $500/month switching to a Kaiser plan on the exchange from a plan offered in a pension by IBM. My ex-girlfriend's mother was on a private plan and got really sick. She was incredibly anemic and was told if they didn't find what was wrong she wouldn't live, so the doctors ran a large amount of tests. After the fact, the insurance company covered very little of the costs, claiming they were unnecessary, sticking her with ~= $500k in medical debt. She had to declare bankruptcy, getting rid of a quite a bit of it, but will never again get a CC or loan, and the stress of that period took many years off her life. This should never happen.

On the "bigger picture": There are astounding flaws in the law, and it was a spectacular failure of a roll-out with the federal exchange. Obama clearly lied about aspects of the law. Many people are losing their previous plans. Prices are going up for the most price sensitive class, healthy 20somethings, that *must* enroll for the law to succeed. The ACA did little to nothing to actually get healthcare costs under control.

Bottom line: What do I think about Obamacare? Well, I don't know. It *personally* had positive effects on me and the people around me, but there are clearly major flaws and questions about the effects and sustainability. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are right, I was definitely overreaching with the "none of this applies." I'm sure there are small-scale farmers out there doing terrible things with crops. From my experience I would say this is not the norm though, and most small-scale organic farmers take pride in and would love to take you on a tour of their farm and discuss techniques.

We are in Colorado and produce a pretty diversified crop because we are really small scale and have a few other businesses, but our highest volume at the market is from greens. We have a few acres of fruit trees as well, which is where we have used the DE. We don't do a whole lot with the fruit trees, but I have friends who have 60 acres of peaches on the Western Slope. They use IPM and have great yields, which sell out in the first 2 hours of the farmer's markets. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be clear, you are talking about corporate organic, which is essentially the same as corporate non-organic. Almost none of what you are talking about applies to small-scale, local farms. When you buy produce from a grocery store, you are correct, although some grocery stores buy from local farms that don't use the "organic" pesticides.

I live on an organic farm that has a few acres and know all the farmers around. Small-scale farmers where I am from do not use the organic pesticides you are talking about, and have really nice crops. There are a few things we have tried like diatomaceous earth (ground up sedimented algae shells), which is nothing close to the pesticides you mention.

Just making the distinction between corporate organic and real organic, and there are HUGE differences between real organic and produce using pesticide and synthetic fertilizer.

I agree that many of the organic crusaders don't know what they are talking about. But the mainstream debate is comparing corporate organic and corporate non-organic which is completely disingenuous to the real organic farms which get labeled under the corporate organic. </TEXT>

To be fair though, you did directly quote the LP in your post which could make one believe it was some sort of plug for the party. It's a shame that the party is so irrelevant and much of the discussion in this sub is on whether you adhere to *true* beliefs of socialist-liberals or minarchists and anarcho-whatevers. So much of this sub is people ranting about their theory and what they believe, then doing nothing, or even offending and scaring potential converts/allies which is much worse than doing nothing.

 It does not promise the immediate creation of some imaginary number of jobs, because government cannot create jobsat least not productive ones that contribute to our long-term prosperity. 

Edit: I was mostly commenting about Mittington's relentless "12 million jobs," rectally extracting this number.  I agree that the private sector should be the ones creating the jobs and can be significantly more efficient, but building infrastructure that encourages the private sector succeed is vital and does create jobs.  I especially liked him in the debate tonight with the "oh, the numbers add up, trust me I was a business man, the numbers add up. I'm not going to tell you what they are but they add up." </TEXT>

<TEXT> The poor won't end up paying more money.  They don't have the money and never will.  When the Republicans talk about lowering the overall tax rate and simplifying the tax code, they want to get rid of deductions such as the first home buyer and mortgage deductions.  Who uses these?  The middle classes.  The upper classes get a tax reduction while the middle classes lose the deductions that lower their tax rates, in turn raising them.  Neither mainstream party truly wants to lower spending, they just want to lower spending where they want and raise it where they want.  The money has to come from somewhere, and if one intake is decreased, it will be increased elsewhere, in the short term or long. </TEXT>

When I was first starting to smoke I wanted to learn how to blow smoke rings.  While waiting for the pipe to be passed back to me, I decided to give it a dry run.  I thought the large rings looked the coolest, so I opened my mouth nice and wide.  I moved my head back and forth to make the smoke come out of my mouth in ring shape.  So my mouth as wide as I can make it, moving front to back.  Just as I realized what this must look like, everyone was looking at me, laughing.  I was too embarrassed to explain what I was trying to do.

<TEXT> I just got back from a year in China, and lived there for a year in 07-08.  Inflation is going through the roof in China.  When I first lived there, I lived like a king.  Everything was very cheap and you still made good money. This time around, stuff was still cheap but not to the same degree.  If you live the same life as some do in Western style - going to clubs and bars - drinks are usually $5-$10, eating Western food- it is close to the same price.  Also, everything cheap in China is cheap - not just price wise but quality wise.

If you find a school to directly enroll in or do private tutoring for small groups you make 25-100/hour, but some are a hassle and and are unable to provide a visa.  Teaching on a student visa or tourist visa is the easiest and pays the most - but if you are caught you can be deported.  If you teach at a training center, you make 10/hour and work nights and weekends.  They will provide you a working visa, but you have to sign a contract and often times they are nazis and pull scandalous gimmicks.
