<TEXT> Brief summary: 

Most of the loss was in this past year.  Exercise has been pretty standard push/pull/legs routine with a stricter focus on diet.  Nothing that unusual -- just old fashioned hard work and time.  Progress has been slow but steady.  

I had a wedding a couple weeks ago, and realized that the only suit I owned was the one I wore in the before photo, in 2013.  It is (obviously) way too large for me now, so I decided to splurge and a new one that fit me.  

It feels so nice to be able to dress sharp and also look the part.  I used to loathe going to any kind of fancy or formal event, but now I'm finding myself looking forward to going to more.

A couple more photos!

This was in 2011 I think: https://i.imgur.com/5FukFn1.jpg

And this was me trying on the new suit at the store a few weeks ago (they tailored the sleeves to be longer, don't worry): https://imgur.com/a/zu5oa </TEXT>

And why not, here's a before/after pic from a few years ago in my old suit:

Old: https://i.imgur.com/5FukFn1.jpg

New: https://i.imgur.com/5PoYfR6.jpg

My thoughts:

They adjusted the sleeve length, and I think it looks better now. The sleeves on the white shirt I'm wearing is a little long, so that might be contributing to it feeling like there's too much cuff. 

There's kind of weird wrinkling in the sleeves. Is it due to a sleeve pitch issue? Or maybe my dress shirt sleeves are too loose and showing through?  The wrinkling felt less pronounced in the store with their sample shirt. 

Overall fit feels nice and comfortable to me, and given I only wear a suit a few times a year for events, I might just live with the quirks. Or maybe it's major enough to warrant taking back for more adjustments. 

Thoughts?

Customized with additional zippers over the top pockets, and the belt removed.

Belstaff is known for their slanted top left pocket, which you can see here https://i.reddituploads.com/f53df90a5eaf49109f2b54d04fd6b167?fit=max h=1536 w=1536 s=b36a2061f85f9180de0d3df0d4fd67b0 

You can also see the belt on the jacket in this shot: http://cinemavine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/john-wick-chapter-2-movie-images-stills-common.jpg

The pant leg was cuffed to the length they'll hem it to, which is probably why it looks fine.  The shoe was a placeholder shoe they had in the store. I'm probably going to be looking for shoes separately later

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First: **They said they'll lengthen the sleeves a bit since there's too much cuff (iirc the salesperson said ~3/4 of an inch) and hem the pants.**  Reason being: according to the salesperson, the size 38R suit fit my shoulders and chest better (with sleeves that are too short) vs the 40R that had decent sleeves but a looser fit. 

Also, it's actually a dark navy blue and not black.  The specific model is the Lazio suit

<TEXT> IMO Allsaints is overpriced at full MSRP, but if you catch one of their fairly frequent sales, the jackets aren't bad.  Give a sale price of $300-600 depending on the piece, IMO most folks have issues with their designs, which tend to be trendy or busy.

I actually think some of the Allsaints jackets look nice, and if nothing else, they are one of the more accessible brands for a lot of people in terms of physically judging if they're comfortable pulling off a perfecto style jacket. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you don't know if you can pull of a leather jacket, or you just want to dip your toes into that style of jacket, IMO faux leather is perfectly fine and maybe even preferable.

Once you know a little more about what kind of leathers work for your normal wear and what doesn't, then it makes sense to buy something more expensive  and permanent.

Faux leather isn't going to like shred the moment you wear it either.  It'll last plenty long enough for you to get a feel for the style. </TEXT>

It's normally $1600 but marked down to $700. Now, 700 is still well within Schott, etc territory. But I've found Belstaff's jackets to fit me much better. 

So with all that said, how do y'all feel about it for $700?  Obv not cheap, but doesn't feel ridiculously overpriced like it is for $1600.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I normally wear medium dress shirts, but they've started to feel a bit big in the shoulders and chest. I grabbed a couple size small dress shirts + a new pair of pants last week.

Thoughts about the fit/style of the shirts or the pants?

Shirts feel like they fit fine, but are a bit tight when I raise my arms above my shoulders. Is that normal?

Fabric around buttons on chest don't stretch when I'm standing normally, but do start tightening slightly if I push my chest out.

<TITLE> Leather jacket fit check </TITLE>

<TEXT> I posted a while back with a jacket I grabbed to see if I could work the overall look: https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/516qna/first_time_trying_out_a_leather_jacket_style/

(Old album: http://imgur.com/a/Tjur4)

Since then, I've worn the jacket pretty consistently, and think it looks great. But it's still faux leather, and I figure it won't last.  It's also not very warm and kinda thin.  To that end, I've been looking around for a real leather jacket that I can wear longer term.

I happened to be in Nordstrom Rack the other day, and found this piece for ~$500, from an original price of $950 (it's Coach, which I know is considered overpriced, but I figured it might not be bad for $500).  

But that's still a buncha dollars so I wanted to get opinions on the fit:

New jacket album: http://imgur.com/a/5dLqR

I have 90 days to return it, so I've got plenty of time to mull over the purchase!

My thoughts: I like the fit through the shoulders, but feel like it might be a little short and the sleeves a little loose. 

I'm also still waffling between a straight black color, and trying to look for a lighter brown.  I like the dark brown! But think maybe black would be usable with more stuff.

Also, if anyone also has suggestions for real life stores to check out, that'd be great (specifically, I'm in the DC/MD/VA area).  I'm wary of just ordering jackets online (at least for my first!) without trying them, especially given how much they cost.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Face/Overall progress**

Since that photo on the left, I got a new jacket!  And LASIK! And a haircut! 

I don't really have a "goal weight" anymore -- the one I set when I was starting out at 240lbs was ~180, since that's what it says on my driver's license (lol).  

Since hitting 180 and beyond, I think it's about refinement and maintenance.

**Body Progress**

At this point, I'm not trying to get super "huge" so much as reduce overall fat and get leaner.  To that end, I've continued to eat at a calorie deficit, while still trying to lift increasing amounts of weight.  I realize it builds muscle mass slower, but it seems to be working okay so far.

In terms of exercising, I've been doing dumbbells with a decent amount of cardio, using this Reddit regimen I found:

I typically do Push/Pull/Leg/Cardio 4 day rotation.   Cardio is pretty like since it also functions as overall rest day -- so just some light jogging, that kind of stuff.  Luckily, I live in DC near the Washington Monument and National Mall, so there's plenty of scenic and great running paths. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've thought about getting a slim fitting leather jacket, but didn't want to go all in price-wise on a high quality leather item without being sure it's a style I could pull off. 

So far now, I grabbed a faux leather piece from Zara that was around $60 and am seeing how I wear it and feel about it in the coming weeks/months.

If it turns out well, I think I'm gonna commit and get a high quality piece. 

Personally, I kinda like the fit (though I worry about it being too tight if I want to layer something heavier than a shirt under it), so if I end up wearing it a lot, need to do some research on quality leather brands that stock pieces of similar style.

Anyway, I'd love thoughts about the fit and style of the jacket, or anything else!

"If HRC released her tax returns and then the release of Trumps, wouldn't that be the nail in the coffin of this argument?"

The answer is: No.

If Hillary released her speech transcripts to try to make Trump release his tax records, his campaign would just say well, why hasn't Clinton given a press conference in so long?

If Clinton then gave a press conference, his campaign would just say well, where are Clinton's complete health records or missing emails?

Point is, if the **DIRECTLY EQUIVALENT** action being taken by Clinton and not Trump isn't enough to close the argument, then nothing will. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have several of those in various sizes.  They are Staub dutch ovens.  They're not cheap, but are typically less expensive than brands like Le Creuset.

Staub dutch ovens are known for a few things:

1. A black enamel interior with a slightly grittier texture.  Le Creuset ovens typically have a cream smooth enameled interior.  Some people prefer the cream because it's easier to see things cooking. Some people prefer the black because it doesn't get discolored and doesn't show scratches easily (the cream enamel will show microscratches and develop a darker shade over time).

2. A "self-basting" lid.  All this means is that the bottom of the lid has a bunch of bumps.  In theory, it's supposed to help baste the food inside by collecting steam and dripping it back down.  In practice, I haven't noticed much difference, TBH.

3. Being heavier than other enameled cast iron pots of similar volume. Some people consider this a plus, as it feels more robust in the hand.  Some people think the extra weight is unneeded and just adds to the burden of using an already heavy pot (no enameled cast iron can be called "light")

For reference, I have a Le Creseut 8qt enameled dutch oven, a Staub 6qt and an All-Clad 8qt tri-ply stockpot that also works well as a dutch oven in a pinch.  

Of the three, I probably use the Staub the most.  Not for any reason related to function--any of the three mentioned pots will be more than fine for nearly any recipe callling for a dutch oven--but because, like you said, I find Staub dutch ovens to be particularly beautiful. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I last posted to this sub ~2 months ago (https://www.reddit.com/r/progresspics/comments/4hs0uv/m3360_240_182_58_face_and_body_progress_with_most/).  Since then, I've stayed mostly true to a low deficit diet while I've tried to figure out where to go from here -- eg, if I should try and lean up and reduce overall body fat, or try and gain more mass.

Right now, I'm mostly doing dumbbells and body weight fitness, and I think it's helped over the past 60 days.  I only went down ~7 pounds, but my body fat has actually decreased by 5% to around 16-17% according to my (admittedly very inaccurate) Fitbit Aria scale.   

But previously I was hitting 20-22% on that same inaccurate measurement, so I think it's progress!

I think for the remainder of the year, I'm going to start focusing on gaining more mass: joining a gym, getting access to heavier weights (and barbells!), and increasing my caloric intake.  I want to keep it relatively clean, however, so it might be slow going. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a weird breakdown of normally reasonable people who can't seem to grasp that a joke can be about Watergate while also unintentionally referencing Gamergate due to the context (and medium) of the joke.

I don't know if Nintendo is a particular sore point or what. 

There's also a lot of people who seem eager to downplay the spread of GamerGate.  I don't doubt that a majority of folks haven't heard about it (even perhaps among devs).  But I think it's silly to excuse major devs/publishers from being unaware.  GamerGate was one of the biggest storms in gaming for a good year and a half, and *still* lives on in the incredible amount of flak any article about diversity or sexism in gaming gets.  It affected a great number of people, and I think its reasonable to expect a big gaming company like Nintendo to think twice before making that joke.

In summary: I think Nintendo goofed, almost certainly without intention or malice. Zoe Quinn (understandably) maybe freaked a bit, given her history and constant bombardment she gets.  Folks look looked at the full video, criticized the goof for what it was.  And then, the internet happened. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Correction, people know about gamergate and the harrassment, but many don't know past that. 

Then they should know enough to realize that referencing a -gate + career ruining is just not a great look for a video game right now, and will probably invite criticism.

 Even if you still insist it's a "Five Guys" reference, ask this, is there any other indication aside from that phrase? 

I'm... not?  Did you actually read my comment, or are you reading past it?

 Those five toads don't proceed to a Zoe Quinn caricature or make any kind of reference to that episode, they just play hide-and-seek and make funny comments, that's it.

Yep, you're reading past it.

 Lastly, about the -gate joke, Watergate is a bigger part of our culture than GamerGate will ever be which is why -gate will always reference Watergate.

GamerGate, in gaming, for _major devs/publishers_ is a big deal contextually.  It's not an -either-or situation.  A -gate can recall both Watergate _and_ GamerGate.  I'm arguing that its hard to believe that a major game company doesn't realize the GamerGate connection.

I've tried to make _very clear_ in my comment that I don't think Nintendo was intentionally referencing GamerGate, or that they added the joke maliciously.  But I do think that a major game company should see that association coming up.  _That_ is what I'm criticizing. That they apparently didn't make that connection.

(Though, yeah, it was a kind of a weird joke to begin with, and especially weird given that Nintendo should know about -gates in gaming.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think we can all mostly agree on three things (I hope):

1. An act doesn't have to be malicious or even intentional to warrant criticism

2. Making a -gate joke in a video game in 2016 that also includes references to ruined careers and "exposing" is super tone deaf, given everything that the industry went through in 2014 and 2015.  TBH I even kinda cringed at the -gate jokes in Batman and other games, even if it was mocking Gators.

3. A major game developer/publisher (even through its localization arm) shouldn't be able to realistically claim ignorance of GamerGate, given the widespread coverage it got both in gaming press and mainstream press over the past several years.

<TEXT>   I mean, I just don't see how it relates to gamer gate in anyway unless you just look only at the screenshots she uses and you have been up to date with gamergate which I think is asking a bit much for a localizer to keep tabs on

GamerGate was one of the biggest controversies in video gaming in 2014 and 2015, covered by a majority of mainstream media outlets, and heavily involved with overarching themes of harassment online and in video games that have gained notoriety in the last couple of years (which, itself, has been covered by outlets like Colbert and John Oliver and a fucking Law and Order: SVU episode)

I think "oh I didn't know GamerGate was a thing" doesn't fly anymore when talking about major game studios/devs.  Claiming ignorance of that entire ordeal is borderline negligence at this point for any major developer that holds itself as an ethically responsible entity, IMO.

I think, in 2016, given all that has happened in 2014 and 2015, a -gate reference in a video game (and also reference career ruining and exposing things) is _going_ to be associated with gamergate by many people.  Rightly or wrongly, that's the association some will make, and Nintendo probably should have made that connection themselves when writing that joke.

At the end of the day, the localization team (which IIRC is in-house to Nintendo, and not some arbitrarily contracted out third party entity) didn't _have_ to user a Watergate or whatever -gate joke.  And they probably shouldn't have.  It's tone deaf given the history of gaming over the past couple of years.  

I doubt it was malicious.  But it was ill-placed, especially given the history and context of gaming, and warrants criticism.   </TEXT>

<TEXT>  But someone popular often wouldn't be friends with someone overweight

But they didn't say that.  As far as the episode is concerned, Noctis gave no indication that he wasn't willing to be friendly with Prompto.  It was all in his head, going purely by the episode.

Prompto was so insecure in his body image that one off-hand remark by Noctis resulted in a year+ long training regimen where he purposefully avoided Noctis.  When he finally presented himself, Noctis didn't even remark on his weight loss.

That's not healthy behavior. Sure, the end result is laudable (for good reasons or ill, achieving and maintaining better fitness and health is commendable), but I wish the episode had Prompto arrive at his current level of fitness in a different manner.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Fatshaming is when someone won't hang out with you because you are fat, and fat kids experience that every day. 

The criticism here isn't that it depicts an overweight person not having confidence, but that the episode does nothing to counteract the idea  that someone "popular", like Noctis, wouldn't be friends who someone overweight.  That's not a knock on Noctis, because as far as I can tell, this was mostly all in Prompto's head.  But the issue I have is that they never really refute Prompto's assumption. 

I realize there's kinda two ways to see this episode:

1. An inspiring tale of Prompto overcoming his weight issues, and living healthier.

2. A cautionary tale that if you want to be friends with cool, popular folk like Noctis, well, you better shape up

I just wish there was a bit more of 1 and a bit less of 2 implied.  They coudl have been childhood friends.  Instead, there was kind of a creepy undertone where Prompto didn't feel "worthy" to be Noctis' friend, and spent years preparing.  But I never got the sense from Noctis that he super cared what Prompto looked like.

<TEXT> I posted a while back (https://www.reddit.com/r/progresspics/comments/4hs0uv/m3360_240_182_58_face_and_body_progress_with_most/), but I feel like I've made some noticeable definition gains over the past many weeks.

I've always vastly preferred working out at home than at the gym. I don't remember how I came across the /r/fitness Dumbbell P/P/L (https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2e79y4/dumbbell_ppl_proposed_alternative_to_dumbbell/) but it seemed like a great thing to try.

I started January 15, so it's been just about 6 months since I adopted the program. I've never lifted before, and only did light cardio. But I bought an adjustable set of 5-52.5 dumbbells, and a cheap bench, and went to work.

I kept logs every session, and did a 3 day P/P/L, 1 day rest schedule.

Weight wise, I think I started around 205 in January, and I'm around 182 right now. I realize that for max gains/cuts you're supposed to do one at a time, but I just kinda did both. Watched what I eat, kept to ~1500-1700 (so a decent deficit), but made sure that I had enough energy to lift a few more pounds each week.

I didn't do any cardio, but I think I may pick that up again. I've also kinda height the limits of my dumbbells now -- on 80% of the exercises in the Dumbbell P/P/L regimen, I've hit my max adjustable weight of 52.5, and just have been doing more reps to compensate. Which isn't great. I don't super want to get a barbell + weight set for home, so maybe I'll bite the bullet and go to the gym. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   I can't stress this enough: some of this stuff might not happen. The reason developers usually don't give insight like this is because if something changes or doesn't happen, players get very angry at us. 

I'm super happy Jeff wasn't deterred by the idiotic Tracer pose uproar, where multiple people (including many in this subreddit) was like "why in the world would a company let devs interact with the community not through PR".

This post is why. This post was awesome. It helps illustrate both the depth and breadth of some of the stuff that Blizzard is currently working on for Overwatch.  Like he says, some of it probably won't happen.  But that's normal.

You want more transparency from game devs?  Then treat them like actual people.  Even when they do something you don't agree with for reasons you don't like. </TEXT>

This is essentially saying that all Chinese reading and speaking regions of the world should use the same wording and translation, which ignores the pretty big differences between Taiwan, Mainland China, and HK.

I have no idea if the PRC is actually involved or not (probably not), but it's definitely following the trend of unifying "Chinese" under the banner of simplified characters and Mandarin. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is it possible to do something like the following in Vim?

http://i.imgur.com/j9Z3mC6.gif

I've been using Emacs full time, but I'm trying to get my Vim setup up to parity for when I've using in remote machines or when I just want to stay in the shell (I find Vim much more enjoyable in the shell than Emacs)

To explain what's going on in the gif above, I'm running a git grep search over a large codebase (I'm just using the Rails codebase as an example here).  The key thing that I really enjoy is that the search runs live as I type. That allows me to quickly try multiple variations of things, and narrow/expand my search as I need to.

I realize this might need something like Neovim's job controls (or I guess the recent Vim 7 patches that add something similar).  Has someone already tackled something like this?  A brief but intense search online didn't yield anything that I could see. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  This means two important things. For one, to talk about a Japanese or American or Brazilian culture leaves a lot of room for error. With such great differences among work-related values within each country, the notion that you can generalize about a countrys work culture is just plain wrong. And two, an American walking down the street in Shanghai is likely to meet many Chinese people with values closer to his or her own than to an average Chinese culture. Assuming that national cultural stereotypes apply to most individuals in a country simply does not work.

I've found this to happen a lot.  A lot of people talking about "Japanese culture" as if it was a single homogenous thing.  This study focuses on work culture, but I think it probalby applies to many other areas of culture as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  But if a games journalist releases footage of themselves performing poorly, then don't expect me to think you will have complete and accurate knowledge of the game, how most game mechanics work, graphics, audio, physics, FPS, etc.

I can tell you in detail the pros, cons, mechanics, weak points, strong points, whatever else of how a particular game of StarCraft 2 went.  I can tell you in detail about the specifics of a Super Smash Brothers Melee match, and what each player was doing, and probalby why.

I'm still only average at both.

It's important to separate knowledge of a game to the mechanical execution of a game, especially when it comes to twitch games like fighters or fast moving first person shooters.

Also, most _developers_ don't have complete knowledge of game mechanics and graphics and audio and phyicss and whatever. You pick these things up gradually, and usually not in an even spread.  Similarly, a particular game journo might be incredilby knowledgable about 4X games, or maybe about CCGs or JRPGs, but be completely lacking in other genres.  That's not a failing. For a medium as wide _and_ as deep as video gaming has gotten, knowing and being good at everything is impossible.

(Tho, yeah, having a journo play a genre they are not great at is not so much unethical as it is bad strat.  But it's hardly something to get super worked up over, IMO.  If you want good gameplay, you can find them easily enough.) </TEXT>

So the reason you don't see demons play more as a loose collection of monsters is that it is an issue of translation.  If you, instead, looked for Western stories (in both mythology and fantasy fiction) about fairies, the fae, goblins, etc, you'll find a much larger morality mix.  

(Note that if you, instead, tried to find Japanese works using the word "oni" instead of "yokai", there's a simllar bias towards " evil", because "oni" is a much closer translation of "demon")

Yokai, and its Chinese relatives, are a much more general word that describes the supernatural milieu of ghosts, spirits, monsters, demons,  sprites, etc.  "Fae" or "Fairy", in the classicalnot Disneysense is the closest popular term I can think of at the moment.  "Daemon" works too, as mentioend by another poster, tho that tends to be too easily confused with the more Christian concepts of demon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, I am Asian.  (Not that it should matter in this discussion, since I don't necessarily think being Asian gives all that much of a unique perspective on it)

 anyone that looks remotely "asian" (be they Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Siberian, etc) are considered pretty much interchangable, even though they lookk nothing alike and have completely different cultures.

Korea, China, Japan all have different cultures, true.  Much in the same way that the UK, the US, Frances, Germany, and many European countries have very different cultures.  (Though just like Western Europe, you'll often find some very familiar themes running through East Asian countries, mostly due to Chinese historical influence)

Appearance though?  Hell, it's a running joke for many Asians that they can't really tell where an East Asian is from.  Are you from Japan? China? Korea? Who knows!  It's relatively common in Asian cinema for a Chinese person to play a Japanese character, or for a Korean actress to play a Chinese woman.  

I *really* think the worries about normalizing out Asian cultures into a generic "Asian" type are overblown.  I mean, IMO, it's certainly overblown compared to the proposed alternative of simply not casting an Asian at all for the role.

It's always struck me as interesting that some of the original "neckbeards" (Greenwood, et al) were also some of the more socially progressive people of their time.  

In a way, the history of science-fiction and fantasy has been about pushing social/technogical norms and boundaries, so it's always super strange to me whenever GG folks or whoever else complain about "politics" in their books/games/movies.

<TEXT> You can't have it both ways.  Players have been demanding more transparency from game developers, wanting to see how games are made in greater detail, wanting to be part of the beta process, wanting to see the naturally iterative process of creation.

But that also means watching parts of the game change, sometimes for reasons you agree with, sometimes for reasons you don't.

Raking Blizzard over the coals because they attempted to communicate a change out seems, well, counter productive.  Sure, they might have avoided a lot of drama.  

But do we really want to go back to the old days of stonewall Blizzard who will only give "when it's done" responses? </TEXT>

100% of them said that the CV1 experience was a whole other level, however.  The realism of the better visuals shouldn't be underestimated.  Comfort, also, was much improved. But it should be noted that none of the ones in the videos wear glasses.  The coworkers who do wear glasses found it quite the ordeal to get the glass frames behind the Rift -- both when putting it on, and when taking it off.

Highlights so far have been the dinosaur dreamdeck demo, Windlands, and Eve Valkyrie.

I'd rate the CV1's built-ins at a notch or so below the M50.  It's quite good considering it's packaged with the unit, and probably a smart thing to have.  I find it super convenient when showing people that I can just ask them to position the built in headphones correctly.  

The bass is definitely lacking, tho that's more due to the design of the headphones (foam on ears) than the quality of the parts.  It's present, and decent, but I wouldn't call it good.

But if you have a good pair of headphones (say, roughly, above $100-150), and you're not constantly showing others or moving the unit, I'd use those.  Especially if you have a separate amp, etc.

On the left, I'm ~225.  On the right, ~184.  

At my highest a few years back (in 2012), I was ~240.  I gained most of my weight in college.  Freshmen year, I was 165.  By the junior year and through the rest of college, I was averaging around 200-215 depending on the year.  But after school, my weight ballooned to 240.

My driver's license is real old and actually still has my weight listed at 165 from when I was in college, haha.  So that's my goal: to get it so I match my license stats again.

I've mostly been eating at a deficit (no specific diet, smaller portions of chicken, veggies, whole grains).  Recently, starting in January, I started doing basic lifts, and I think that's really helped me get additional definition around my shoulders.

I haven't really set aside for cardio, but as the weather gets nicer, I've thought about running in the morning.

I've mostly been self directed so far, but am considering joining up with a gym for more directed training.  

I've been stuck in the 180-185 range for about a month now, and not entirely sure what I need to do to get past it.   </TEXT>

1. An overblown sense of invincibility is a symptom, I think, of being in your early 20s in general, and not one specific to white college kids.

2. This is taking everything that the North Korean gov is saying what he did as face value, which does not seem very prudent

3. Regardless of why he did something, the punishment far far outweighs the crime, and we shouldn't let white privilege schadenfreude undermine the very real humanitarian considerations here </TEXT>

<TEXT> Following up from a face progress post a made a few weeks, ago, I've been taking regular shots on my phone to keep a record of progress.  I hadn't really looked until today at the very first shot I took when I was ~230 and the shot I took just most recently ~187. 

I'm still not there muscle and tone wise, but things are starting to firm up! 

I originally focused on a pure cardio routine every day to try and lose weight, but have recently (for the past 4 weeks) been doing a dumbbell lifting regimen I found on Reddit.  And already, I feel like I'm beginning to see some additional definition.

My arms still feel pretty weak and flabby tho, it feels like most of the additional definition has gone to my chest, shoulders, and waist/stomach area </TEXT>

The **Alex Verus** novels by **Benedict Jacka** is one that was super interesting and fun for me.  It features a ton of powerful wizards, but the main character is a diviner.  Yes, that school of magic every laughs at and never picks in D D.  It's one of the few books that takes seriously the idea of practical divination, and it's pretty fascinating.

<TEXT>  Whenever there is a moment in the film Rey is going to be in danger, all suspense is extinguished when she effortlessly navigates through any challenge or trial put in front of her.

I don't think you understand what "effortlessly" means.  Remember how she effortlessly triggered the fuses on Han's freighter and in turn effortlessly releases his rampaging cargo?

 she can use a lightsaber (extremely well)

In the first movie, in his first training session, Luke was able to _reflect blaster bolts_.  Also, her lightsaber usage and style was also very precisely designed to look like she was chopping -- very different than the swooping arcs that others use.  This was deliberately designed.

  has shown to have an incredible ability where she can overpower an established force user (Kylo Ren)

A force user that was shot with a bowcaster that was hyped the whole movie as very deadly and powerful, that had already been slashed by a lightsaber, and she _still_ initially got slammed into a tree and would have likely been killed or captured if not for Finn intervening.  Plus, Kylo Ren was held off by _Finn_, a force insensitive who had never used a Lightsaber in his life.  So obviously the movie is taking some liberties, or maybe Kylo Ren just isn't that strong.

Anyway, you think she's too perfect and powerful. I don't.  But more to the point, we've been shown time and time again through successful movies (like the original Star Wars or hell nearly every modern action movie), that you know what? People tend to like powerful main characters who might be "too competent".  There's nothing wrong with that, and its a curious coincidence that the particular complaint about "Mary Sues" only flares up now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The big primary UGH that I have with the op-ed is the sentiment that "whiteness" as vehicle for universal appeal is a status quo that's worth being maintained.

The author attempted to clarify on Twitter:

"So in my piece, I define the "superhero" as being an American construct and one steeped in secular American values"

"And we all have our heroes. But the concept of a "superhero" seems uniquely American."

But that doesn't make it better. The very thing that the on-going diversification efforts in comics are trying to address is the idea that being "American" or possessing "American" values also means being white. That the author seems unable to acknowledge other racial and ethnic groups as being just as American as anything else speaks the ill-effects of "whiteness" as universal appeal.

America is incredibly diverse, and the on-going effort to make American comics reflect that diversity should only make comics feel more American, not less. </TEXT>

You'll see a lot of the type of characters in Legend repeat, a lot of the events and morals come up in the same way again and again, and while there will be a few differences here and there, if you smash them together, they'll blur, for sure.

This is actually exactly the way I also think about David Eddings, but like Gemmell, I recommend both without reservation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are actually (at least) two confirmed witnesses, both working for DreamHack, both with no real incentive to lie about (1) a player attending their event (2) a person employed by the event as a host.  If anything, they should be incentivized to *downplay* the actions of their host.

Both of their statements reflect that not only did Richard Lewis initiate physical contact, "strangle" is also the  appropriate verb. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The biggest current flag about Richard Lewis should be that Richard Lewis agreed to write for Breitbart.  Pickings might be slim in the esports journalism market, but if you're agreeing to write for that publication, any respect I have for you immediately drop to 0.  Breitbart stands for a lot of things, and from the two linked articles that Richard Lewis wrote above, it sadly seems like he fit right in to Breitbart's brand of sham journalism.

This is a "journalist" who, when approached on Twitter about using an uncredited photo, explodes over what he terms "faggot melodrama".  I made a tweet a bout it a few years back that gained some traction, and he acted like a man-child the entire way through. http://i.imgur.com/pdA30ty.jpg

<TEXT> I think there's an important distinction between censorship, the act you and the ACLU describe, and _censorship_ the abhorrent crime against freedom that many others label the decision to not use a bust of Lovecraft.

Technically it's censorship, but IMO it's not really _censorship_, no in the alarmist sense that so many promote as leading to some kind of 1984/Fahrenheit 451 society downfall scenario.  No one is removing Lovecraft from the shelves, no one is even calling for anything that impacts Lovecraft as an author.  This is purely about the symbol that the _World_ Fantasy Aware chooses to use to represent the honors it bestows on someone.

IMO, this is censorship at its most benign and helpful: a decision to remove and select a different thing that harms no one and helps foster inclusiveness.  

(There's plenty of other examples of benign censorship: a TV station deciding to delay or cancel episodes in the wake of a disaster, </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think of all the major gaming sites, Polygon has been the most consistent about treating GG for what it is.  The letter from the editor that Grant wrote during the height of GG last year (amidst all the letters from Gamespot, IGN, Giant Bomb, etc) was pretty emphatic for what they think GG represents, and I think the least "both sides" of the bunch: http://www.polygon.com/2014/10/17/6996601/on-gamergate-a-letter-from-the-editor

<TITLE> My personal endgame keyboard: Filco Majestouch 2 Convertible with Cherry Browns and Bluetooth </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-10-27 15:50:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **Picture**: http://i.imgur.com/yMzVaYa.png

**Features**: Cherry Browns. Bluetooth. Costar Stabilizers.

So far, I love it. I've been used Filco boards for the past 5 years or so, and this is probably my personal endgame board.  

**Quick thoughts:**

Previously, I used an original Filco Majestouch 1 with the gold label with Cherry Browns at the office.  I also have a matching Filco Majestouch 2 with Cherry Browns at home.   

One of the few things I really wanted was wireless capability.

Compared to the two boards I currently have, the Filco Majestouch 2 Convertible feels exactly the same, which fits my needs perfectly.  In all respects, it feels like a standard Filco wired board *except* that it has Bluetooth.  Nice solid keyboard with my preferred type of stabilizers (costar).

It also has the added benefit of having a removable usb cable since it's "convertible", meaning you can also plug in a USB cable to use it in wired mode.

The actual bluetooth implementation is great.  It supports up to 4 paired devices, switching between them by pressing a key combination and then the 1-4 keys.  This means I can keep my main work laptop, my phone, desktop, and a spare all on the same board.

<TEXT> There are **200+ customer reviews** (http://www.amazon.com/Rock-Band-Band-Box-Bundle/dp/B00Z9HS664) of the game in its various bundles and platforms.

I can't really muster up any anger for 7 employees that buy their company's own game and then leave (I'm going to assume honest from their pov*) reviews.  Is it kinda scummy they don't disclaim it?  Sure.

Is it worth the moniker of "rogue employee" or indicative of some kind of sinister plot to seed Amazon reviews?  I hardly think so.

 No excuses. Companies are not supposed to reviewing their own products, PERIOD.

Employees will review their company's product all the time because, guess what, most employees are users of their company's product.

Amazon reviews are not press reviews.  They are, literally, reviews by users. That's it. No more, no less.

Yes, disclaiming would be nice. But I'm not gonna lose any sleep over it.

(the "new to rockband" thing is by an employee who isn't a dev of the game, so i can buy that. i mean, i have friends who work at blizzard who have never played WoW or touched StarCraft.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> A few suggestions, and I'm trying to keep them limted to first person POV books:

- Iron Druid series, similar to Dresden Files, but more light, witty, featuring the best damn dog in fantasy

- The Nightside books by Simon R Green (probably my favorite guilty pleasure novels of all time). Think Dresden with set in London with even more weird shit 

- Secret History books by Simon R Green

- Sandman Slim books. quite a bit darker than dresden, but still has its share of dark and gallows humor

<TEXT> I don't think anonymous sources aren't inherently wrong -- but it is basically trading on the trust and reputation of the outlet.  

I think the issue with the Escapist piece on Star Citizen was how poorly they handed Chris Roberts' response, and how many holes were poked into Escapist's info subsequently.

Basically, your shit better be tight, and the story that's sourced anonymously better stand up to scrutiny.

In the case of Kotaku's article on Trendy, it was apparently accurate enough for role changes to happen at Trendy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My general take at least re: criticisms that are written in the U.S. for games that are released in the U.S: if it's sold and marketed for an American audience, then it's totally fair to criticize through the lens of an American audience.

That doesn't invalidate other forms of criticismsthere's a ton of writing about gaming that aren't written through the lens of progressive American values.  But I certainly don't think that looking at a game released in a region through that region's cultural mores is _wrong_.  It's just a single facet of what should be a healthy, multi-faceted discussion about games. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is a game like Senran Kagura damaging to the industry? I dunno, probably not.  All media have its share of high and low concept artifacts.  For every timeless film you probably have ten late night softcore flicks.  

Is the game sexist? Yes, likely. While it's certainly not the worst of its kind, the game is very obviously geared towards a specific (male) audience.

Do the sexual aspects bring it down?  Probably.  Not so much in the sense that I'm deriding your appreciation of the series, but in the sense that if, as you say, the game actually has strong characterization and nuance in how it approaches morality, then the overt sexualization of its characters and its presentation of those characters limits the possible audience for the game.  And yes, I do think the sexualization makes it harder to past presentation into whatever deeper core the game offers.

(See: Bayonetta 2, and the actual great beat em up mechanics that are hidden behind a presentation that is off-putting to some)

My take? The game is controversial.  Any game like Senran Kagura is going to be (rightfully or wrongfully) criticized in the current gaming climate.  After the events of GameGate last year, and the overall trend to being more aware of females in gaming and larger diversity issues over the past few years, a game like Senran Kagura is not going to just pass by without comment.

If you like it, then that's great! I don't think you are any less of a person for liking the game, and I think any game criticism that goes beyond the game and into criticism of the players of the game is taking it a step too far.  People like different things.  IMO the goal isn't to prohibit what people like. It's to try and expand horizons, increase awareness.   </TEXT>

"I dunno how about some kind of issue that makes it so that she has to wear as little clothing as possible."

"Great! And if anyone complains, we just tell them its part of the *story*, and then they'll feel ashamed for making fun of Quiet's condition."

<TEXT>  (ostensibly objective) 

if the review is subjective, and the review content is subjective, what makes you think the reviewer's score is objective?

Do you also think that AV Club's grade-school A/B/C/D stuff is an objective indicator of the quality of a show? Or that Yelp stars or Critic ratings are an objective indicator of a restaurant's food?

Numerical numbers is, at its most base, a quick and easy way to tell *if that particular reviewer* liked the game.  That's it.  A game with mostly high scoring reviews? Then there's wide critical acclaim.  A game with a mix of high and low scores? Then there's mixed reception.

This happens in movies literally every time a film comes out, and you rarely see people make a stink about it online.

<TEXT> Eh, I dunno.

From what I can, most of the recommendations for Spacemacs occurs within the context of selling emacs to an existing Vim user.  In that case, how much value is gained by telling them to forget their built in muscle memory for a system of key commands and patterns that, out of the box, are not super great?

The best part about Emacs is its extensibility in all areas, and I don't know if there's a better way of showing that to a Vim user than Spacemacs.  They get the best of both worlds: a production Vim-like environment with all the niceties that Emacs offers over Vim: background processes, elisp, etc.

(Disclaimer: I don't use Spacemacs, but I have a home grown config using evil to give me a Vim-like environment. I also consider Vim style modal editing and keyboard shortcuts to be much superier to emacs style chording shortcuts) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the restaurant metaphor someone used further in that thread is apt.  To extend that:

Imagine there's this family restaurant called Reddit's Good Time BBQ, and everyone in town goes there.  It's super popular.  It's one of the biggest places to eat out around.  All sorts of people visit, and generally mind their own business.  You eat, you talk to your group, you leave.  

Then sudden a big noisy family comes in, let's call them Fred Coontown, Sally Coontown and their twins Bobby and Sandy Coontown.  They talk loudly.  They talk loudly about hateful things, and call the other members in the restaurant racial epithets.  And maybe it's just them.  Maybe they only show up one day a week, and for most of the time, Reddit's Good Time BBQ is a friendly establishment.

But Fred Coontown and family are gathering attention.  They're loud, controversial, and can't help but occasionally walk over to other tables and start up heinous conversations.  Fred might even call over Sally for support.

It's getting out of hand.  People are complaining.  The Yelp reviews for the restaurant are plummeting, and reputation is at an all time low.  

So what does Reddit's Good Time BBQ do?  

It's basically faced with two choices:

1. Kick the Coontowns out.
2. Leave the Coontowns alone, and let them eat.

Actually, I lied, and everyone was wrong because there's really a third option that no one considered.  In their brilliance, Reddit's Good Time BBQ went with: 

Give the Coontowns their own private dining area and let them eat for free, but put up a sign on the front door saying "Warning: Fred Coontown is in the house".

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3d67oa/goal_were_back_baby_operationazureorbs_message/

From the sample email:

 And The Verge, ironically libelled a respected Scientist as a 'misogynist' for wearing a T-Shirt of clad women. This incident has now become infamous, yet how can a Vox property slander men for liking clad women yet SB-Nation covers sports which have cheerleaders? Who's primary goal is to look clad for men?

It's pretty funny that as far as I can tell, with 94 comments and 451 upvotes at the moment, no one has called out the egregious typos in the sample email (wtf is just "clad", "who's", "SB-Nation" vs "SB Nation").  

Also, missing the irony.

My only conclusion is that GamerGate, in grand tradition, doesn't even read their own articles and posts before commenting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a tough call with Martin and asoiaf. The sexism in his world definitely adds to the flavor of the settingsand arguably to the realism. But in the novels at least, IMO I think he's handled it mostly respectfully.

Anyway, with the larger issue of realism in fantasy, one of the best responses is also from one my authors, Scott Lynch: http://scott-lynch.livejournal.com/159686.html

 What you're really complaining about isn't the fact that my fiction violates some objective "reality," but rather that it impinges upon your sad, dull little conception of how the world works. I'm not beholden to the confirmation of your prejudices; to be perfectly frank, the prospect of confining the female characters in my story to placid, helpless secondary places in the narrative is so goddamn boring that I would rather not write at all. I'm not writing history, I'm writing speculative fiction.

Which isn't to say those films don't have issues with sexism or diversity, and that those issues didn't also carry over into the game.  Just pointing to them to provide context for the game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> lol. The Freitag backpack (even at $400) will likely outlast and be used longer than a $400 graphics card, or a $500 console, or a $400 phone, or any number of disposable electronics that most people buy today.

(I think Freitag way overcharges due to their brand.  Their construction is superb, but the patterning and designs are a little staid and impractical)

The fact that so many people in that thread can't even comprehend spending $400 on something like a backpack (that's likely used regularly) speaks volumes to their age, maturity, and general understanding of the world.  I hope they never find out how much fancy watches cost, or actual fashion brand bags and clothing cost.  They might die from shock. </TEXT>

And then, of course, promptly forgot all about it once it came out that he was absolutely incorrect in his claims.

<TEXT> The calculus in the Barry fight is ultimately pretty simple:  10 guys vs 1 guy in an enclosed space where the 10 guys have daggers and the 1 guy has a sword  means the guy with the sword is probably dead, no matter how skilled.

The logistics of that encounter just means that the 10 can flank/surround/attack together without worry about each others weapons getting in the way each other.  Daggers, particularly, can be debilitating in close quarter fighting.  They are hard to see, quick enough to be hard to dodge, small enough to be hard to parry, and just in general, really fucking annoying when you have a number of them going at you from multiple angles.

This is also what happens when a group of 10 people _don't_ use standard tv/movie logic and attack one at a time.  

In fact, I give high props to Barryand his legendary prowessthat he managed to survive so long and kill so many given the power imbalance.

For all the magic and dragons and undead in Song of Ice and Fire, I've always felt that the violence and fighting and overall physicality of combat hew pretty close to the grimdark formula of _yeah, these characters are good, but they are still human_.

He _might_ have done better with armor, but historically, in enclosed fighting, daggers are also pretty adept at fighting open gaps and joints in armor.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not really.  I've read all the books, and I've kept current with the show, and the biggest, most important point that you need to accept is that **the show is not the book**.

Accept that, and you can enjoy (or not enjoy!) each separately.  Because there are things about the books that infuriate me, and things about the show that infuriate me, and they are rarely about the same people or scenes.

Granted, if you're worried about book spoilers from the show (even in a form that's twisted because the show is not the book), then yes, you should probably stop watching.  </TEXT>

Neil Gaiman also narrates many of his own books: Neverwhere, Stardust, Ocean at the End of the Lane.  Having the author narrate a book is always a special treat for me.

<TEXT> Worldcon *never* claimed that the Hugos represented all of fandom.  But then, breadth of representation and prestige are not strongly tied.   Some of the most prestigious awards in the world are selected and given by a relatively small number of judges in proportion to the size of the industry: Michelin stars, Academy awards, the Nobel Prize, etc.  Correia seems to believe that a prestigious award must necessarily be a "people's choice" award.  **That's false in nearly every single industry that gives awards.**

The Hugos are famous and carry prestige for one reason and one reason only: history.  They have been around a long time, counts among its voting membership some industry greats, and has, through the decades, mostly recognized the right people for their works (though maybe not at the most ideal time in some cases).

That Correia is incapableor more likely, unwillingto recognize this fact speaks volumes about the cogency of his position, and the integrity of his position.

At the end of the day, I cannot help but think this is yet another conservative trying to open yet another front in the great left/right schism in America.  (And in this specific case, I don't think Scalzi/et al are helping stem that schism, though Scalzi has certainly been less harmful to the Hugos than Correia) </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Hugos **matter**.  Not to everyone, perhaps.  But to the industry, as one of the most prestigious prizes awarded in sf/fantasy fandom? Oh yes.

Growing up, finding an unread sci fi/fantasy book with the "*Hugo winning*" or even "*Hugo nominated*" badge in the new arrivals section at the local library was like finding a treasure. Theres legacy to the history of the Hugos that lends its nominations and its winners weight.

What the Sad Puppies have donethis year especiallyis to tarnish that legacy. Through bloc voting for an agreed upon slate of books, theyve diminished the Hugos as a metric for judging quality science fiction and fantasy books as voted on by Sci Fi/Fantasy fandom.

That last part is important: **fandom**.

The greatest crime of the Sad Puppies voting contigent isnt to nominate authors that I think have despicable personal views on politics and other issues. The greatest crime of the Sad Puppies is weaponizing the culture war going on in the U.S. right now to sabotage what the Hugos have always been, and always should be: a reflectionsometimes something good, sometimes something disgracefulof the taste and judgement of science fiction and fantasy fandom.

Fandom. Not people only interested in seeing SJW tears. Not right-wing conservatives only interested in opposing progressives in yet another front of the great left/right schism in America. Not even those extreme progressives who blindly vote for diversity without regard to quality.

/u/randomthrowaway102 links to a great comment by GRRM about this that I think is extremely relevant to *why* the "many new voices" brought on my Sad Puppies is so damaging.  These new voices *are not* sf/fantasy fans.  Frequently, they don't even pretend to be.

Commenter:

I honestly don't understand why you're upset about increased participation in the Hugo Awards. Isn't inclusion, as represented by these many new voices, meant to be a liberal value?

GRRM:

 But is this inclusion?

 I want worldcon to grow and thrive, and have tried for many years to encourage new people to attend, volunteer, become part of it.
Are the Sad Puppies joining the worldcon community? I sure don't get that sense. Reading their posts, especially in the comments section, suggests that a good many of them (not all, I hope) want only the rockets... oh, and to discomfit and upset the people they call "SJWs." They talk about buying popcorn to enjoy the show, and savoring the taste of our tears.

 That doesn't sound like someone who wants to sit down and have a beer with me and argue about Robert A. Heinlein.

<TEXT>  Now, I love the Hugos and everything it represents. My apprenticeship as a novelist has been a steady diet of Hugo-winning novels since I was just a baby bookworm. 

I fully admit I've let this year's Hugo noms get under my skinand I probably shouldn't let itbut an underlying reason, I think, is that I still *place value* on being "Hugo nominated".  I'm not a novelist, but I grew up reading Hugo and Nebula nominated and winning books, and I remember always feeling a great twinge of excitement whenever I saw an unread novel at my local library bearing a Hugo or Nebula blurb.

I *don't want* the Hugos to go away.  But I also don't want the focus being only on Hugo winners.  Being nominated for a Hugo should be a huge honor, and I think the slate voting this year (and last, to an extent) severely undermines what being nominated for a Hugo should mean.

(I mean, there's not a snowballs chance in Hell that Vox Day is going to win his categories, but it's still disconcerting that Vox Day is able to count himself among the list of Hugo nominees due to the Hugo vote process) </TEXT>

<TEXT>  But at the very least, you could read them. I don't generally like Tom Kratman's work. I hold him solely responsible for the mess that Ringo's Aldenata series has turned into. But I read Big Boys Don't Cry and I think it's actually probably one of the best novellas I read last year.

That's part of the dilemma, I think.  Some of the work on the Sad Puppies slate might actually be good, but the nature of the slate means that some *other* good works probably got knocked out of the running due to the voting bloc.

(Some think, for example, that Cixin Liu's *Three Body Problem* [a great novel that was honestly a great example of the sort of sci-fi I think many people of all views would enjoy] might have garnered a nomination if it wasn't overran by on-slate nominations for Sad Puppy approved works)

It makes it so that if I don't want to reward bloc voting via slate, the only real choice, imo, is "no award".  Because even if Kratman's work is good, the advent of the slate means that the novella's competition in that category is severely crippled.   </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Meanwhile none of this, at all, has anything to do with whether the book is worthy of being considered "The best scifi or fantasy written this year."

Sure -- and in cases like best novel, I'll still vote as normal, by reading the works in the nomination list.  (I've already read most of the best novel nominees anyway, except for the single MH entry)

But in cases like best novella and others where the evidence for an author or work being listed solely because of the slate is obvious?  

I mean, I've read some of John C Wright's work (The Hermetic Millenia), and while I don't think it's terrible (unlike his personal views), I highly, *highly* doubt that his writing ability has improved such in the past year that he landed 6 hugo nominations on his own merit.

In cases like that? Yeah, I'm comfortable voting "no award".  Not because I dislike their personal politics (I reserve that for my personal purchases), but because "no award" is the only choiec in some categories that *doesn't* reward slate voting. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  If someone writes a good scifi novel, does it matter what their politics are? 

Insofar as saying whether or not the scifi novel was "good", no, it doesn't.  (I actually read the first couple Monster Hunter books and enjoyed them as brainless pulpy fun before stopping the series after I learned more about the author)

But as it relates to if I would want to purchase that work and read it, or recommend that author to friends?  Oh yes, definitely.  

(And in this specific case, I'd feel perfectly fine voting against works on the slate not because of their chosen ideological pedastal, but because they got there via voting bloc shenanigans)

(The Best Novel category does give me pause though, because I think most of the works on that list could feasibly get their on their own merit.  So I'd vote that category as normal by reading everything and voting accordingly)

 The root of all of this is the desire to maintain ideological purity or to make a fan voted award for the "best" scifi and fantasy of the year be representative of some political goal. It's just as contemptible when employed against people like Vox Day as it is when employed by them.

There's a difference here.  Vox Day and John C Wright *actively reject* certain opinions and ideologies as anathema to civilized behavior.  (eg, Wright's reaction to the end of Korra).  In most cases, the so called SJW tendencies ask that other viewpoints and authors simply be considered. 

The rejection of viewpoints that encourage active rejection is not, in itself, some kind of contemptible rejection.  Down that way lies madness. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why?  I highly doubt Sad Puppies are against not liking something who is attempting to (legally) game the Hugo voting process. And if they are actually against that, then they have an interesting way of showing it.

If you mean judging a work on its own merits rather than my views of the author, sure.  You can read like that if you want.  In my personal consumption of media, I like to know that the person I'm supporting with my purchases is someone I'd feel good about supporting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In a perfect world, the Hugo's are about the works, and not the author. The Sad Puppies voting bloc, however, invalidates that approach. As such, I feel perfectly fine in disregarding works represented on that slate when voting (I'm a supporting member), assuming the author/group/etc in question knowingly accepted being on the slate.

More importantly, I'm also talking about my personal reading choices, and in my personal reading choices, I can use whatever criteria I see fit.  And yes, how much I like the creator plays a role into my personal consumption choices (for all media, not just books). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that's a pretty great point.  Another example:  I devoured Heinlein during my middle school and early high school years.  Read nearly every book he put out. To my middle/high school brain, they felt free of politics.  Obviously, they weren't.  But they *seemed* that way to me back then because (1) I wasn't looking for it, (2) I wasn't aware of many of the politics that were running through his work, and (3) I also privately agreed with many of the things I *did* notice, and hence attributed to good writing/storytelling resonating with a reader what would've otherwise been politics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right, I feel bad for Andromeda Expressways as well.  But they've also gone out and clarified their stance on the matter.

With the publicity that this year's Hugo awards have been getting (especially in the circles that Kloos and others run), I'd find it extremely suspicious for any Sad Puppy nominee to continuing being "surprised" at being included, and to use "I wasn't aware" as an excuse to not make a statement one way or the other on the slate.

I'm willing to admit that the Sad Puppy slate put forth some works that possibly deserve a nominationbut at the same time, being willing (or at least, expressly not against) to be used by the slate as a hammer to get nominations is a character flaw that I'm not sure I can support.

But this is why I'm seeking clarification.  I'm more than willing to give authors/publications/editors/etc on the Sad Puppy slate the benefit of the doubt wrt their involvement, assuming they state as much, like Andromeda Expressways. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Audiobooks have honestly been a lifesaver to me.  I probably average about ~1.5 hour commute every work day, and given that time, I can usually finish 2-3 audiobooks a month.  (I've recently just caught up on Kevin Hearne's quite excellent Iron Druid books narrated with amazing performances by Luke Daniels)

Otherwise, I do most of my reading on the Kindle.  For a long, *long* time, I was a give-me-paper-or-give-me-death kind of guy, but over the past several years I've changed my mind.  I still buy hardback and paperback versions of my favorites "to keep", but otherwise, I've shifted all of my reading to the Kindle.  It's just too convenientand light weight!to use.

<TEXT> I'm asking because if so, my opinions of people like Jim Butcher are going to change drastically (there's a difference between being used by a platform because of your views, and explicitly agreeing to join a platform that included the likes of Vox Day).

At least one party claims to have given no explicit permission: http://www.sfsignal.com/archives/2015/04/finalists-2015-hugo-award-with-free-fiction-links/#comment-147655, so it's possible that there are others who, likewise, were nominated by the sad puppies without their knowledge.

Does anyone have any links or confirmation/denials from the various Sad Puppy nominees with regards to their complicit approval? 

EDIT:

Other authors that I've enjoyed reading that I would... have issues continuing to read if they willingly accepted being on the Sad Puppies slate (https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2015/02/01/sad-puppies-3-the-2015-hugo-slate/):

<TEXT> I don't like Breitbart either, but the title is a little misleading.  Brietbart didn't want the game censored (insofar as they didn't explicitly ask the game be censored).

This is like Polygon writing about Hatred and saying "look at this gross shit".  

We rightly defended Polygon for being able to write about Hatred without being accused of wanting censorship, and at least from what I'm gathering from the article, Breitbart is in a similar situation. </TEXT>

Even if every pirate paid for their content afterwards, it's still unethical.  If I steal something from a store, and then go back and back later, that doesn't invalidate the original act of theft.

I have nothing against piracy: I think it's unethical, but whatever.  People do unethical things every day.  What I find most amusing is the mental gymnastic that frequent piraters go through to rationalize and justify their choice as not unethical. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  And i am saying that people who wanna make money out of art should rather try to find a way where the risk is reduced instead of stating what you just did.

Things I'm going to guess you don't do:

1. Go to restaurants and ask for a sample of their entree before ordering.

2. Go to concerts, and ask to sit in for 15 minutes.

 Don't jugde people who pirate

Why not?  Pirating normally-paid content is wrong.  End of story.  All justifications are people who are unwilling to accept that they are engaging in an unethical act.  Just face it: you are doing something the creator of the content you enjoy finds immoral.  Nothing is going to happen to you if you admit it.   </TEXT>

These are options an ethical person would evaluate:

1. Decide to not get the thing.

2. Save up money and get the thing.

3. Investigate avenues of making more money, and when you have the money, get the thing.

And guess what?  This actually works for everything!  Cars, houses, electronics, jewelry, books, that fancy restaurant down the street.

There's also a 4th option: admit that it's stealing, accept that it's an unethical action, stop trying to justify it, and get on with your life.  You're *never* going to get approval from a content creator for stealing their content.  Exasperated acceptance that it's unavoidable from some, maybe, but not approval.   </TEXT>

This looks especially spineless in the face of what Salesforce did when they pulled all travel.  

Granted, GenCon says they have a contract with Indianapolis through 2020, _but they knew this when they wrote the original letter about SB101_.

<TEXT> The problem with "neutrality" is that it implies that there are two sides. There aren't.  There's GamerGate, and everyone else.  

A typical GamerGate "neutral" is someone who shares many beliefs with GG, but is unwilling to publicly proclaim support for GG.  You see this commonly in comment threads and seal lions the world over.  The "I don't know much about GG, *BUT* I think regurgitates previously refuted GamerGate talking points".

There's no such thing as a "real neutral".  The closest thing is an uninvolved person who not only has no knowledge of GG, but also doesn't really care about video games.  In this case, they are not so much neutral as completely tertiary to the controversy.  

(Notably, they also won't be commenting on GG-related threads.)

And then there are the "neutrals", people who just want the status quo.  Sometimes, this is couched as a positive: "Why can't we just go back to how it was like before GamerGate?"  Sometimes, this is couched as a plea for peace: "If everyone would just calm down, GamerGate would already be over."  

The common thread of "neutrality", as I've seen it, is that the status quo is seen as a positive balance.  

But as well all know, the status quo is anything but a positive environment for diversity.  Anita got harassed plenty before GamerGate.  Females in gaming faced challenges way before GamerGate.  The general tone of diversity in gaming has been a rising tide of criticism for years and years.  

GamerGate did not cause these things.  **In fact, seen another way, many GamerGate supporters are merely an extreme, militant, radical idealization of the classical "neutral"**:   They want a return to a status quo as well, but engage in abhorrent tactics and rhetoric in that pursuit.  GamerGates have an internalized utopian view of gaminga perverted concept of what "real gaming" or "pure gaming" or, ultimately, the status quo of gaming should be and, in their minds, has been.  

The self-proclaimed "neutral", meanwhile, also wants a status quo (that is perhaps more grounded in reality), but won't put any effort towards that goal beyond stating "wasn't it great back then?" </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's the typical "I was here first" elitism that also gives way to things like "real gamers" and "real games".  Ignoring the fact that gaming has been more or less mainstream for over a decade now (if not longer), large parts of GamerGate have this incredibly myopic sense that *they* are the gamers.  That *they* are the audience.  They are unableor unwillingto accept that there were people playing games before them, and that there are people playing games after them.

It's this sentiment that gives rise to ridiculous claims of "ignoring your customers" and "attacking your audience".  Because that self-inflated sense of importance, of being capital-G Gamers, means that necessarily all others must think and act as they do.  

Because paramount to your average GamerGater's sense of identity is that because they self-identify to a group, all others self-identifying to that group must feel the same way.

The unfortunate corollary to this is that anything to preserve that ego is seen as positive, and anything that diminishes that ego is not only seen as a negative, but also as a sweeping attack on all who self-identify with that group.  

Indeed, the primary outrage amongst GamerGaters isn't so really personal outrage, but outrage *on behalf* of other gamers.  Hence why that outrage is so often fueled to a larger than life state.  They are not fighting on behalf of self, they are fighting on behalf of the Gamer ego, extended by fiat to all the other imagined Gamers in the world who are wronged. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've read a ton of wuxia novels (mostly in Chinese, tho), and watched probably more iterations of The Condor Trilogy on TV from both Hong Kong and Mainland China than I really care to count. You've honestly covered most of the immediate suggestions that came to mind.

(I'd note that while the classical Wuxia of Jin Yong might be defined primary by its martial focus, the wider world of wuxiaincluding works by Gu Long and Liang Yushengoften features charactesr and narratives that are much more focused on politics, or mysteries, or even slice of life.)

But with that said, a few more, though some stretch your core requirements of martial focused wuxia a bit:

**Deathstalker Cycle by Simon R Green**.  More pulpy sci-fi than fantasy, perhaps, but has a pretty well populated milieu with plenty of fascinating characters.

**Red Country by Joe Abercrombie**. This novel isn't standalone, and requires reading The First Law to understand much of the subtext.  But it's also remarkably similar in narrative structure and tone to many wuxia novels.

**The Magicians by Lev Grossman** 

**Nightside novels by Simon R Green**

**Cycle of Fire by Janny Wurts**

**A Wizard of Earthsea and its sequels by Ursula Le Guin**.

(A few **Discworld** novels are also remarkably similar to some wuxia stories in both scope of milieu and narrative.  They're all great, so I'd just recommend the entire series.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's fine. It's only a "divide" because GamerGate has taken a "agree-or-destroy" approach to civil discourse and rational disagreement.  As the industry (and overall readership) grows, there are necessarily going to be sites that lean one direction or another on issues.

You see the same in traditional news sources (ie, NY Times vs Wash Post)

It's not a bad thing, though I could buy the argument that it's not a great thing either.  

But practically speaking, sites need to find their audience (and via that, their revenue) via differentiation of content and voice.  In the current media climate, it's near impossible to survive solely from factual news reporting.  Sites need a voice.

Sometimes the voice adopted might be personally offensive (eg, The Escapist), but whatever.  I'm okay with that. It's only crossing the line if Escapist adopts a GamerGate stance and encourages the active destruction or malicious interference of other sites. </TEXT>

Daniel Vavra proceeds to then blow it completely out of proportion, acts as if every publication in the known world is gunning for him to put historically inaccurate PoC in his historically accurate computer simulation, and engages in what is, as far as I can tell, a persecution-complex fueled whine-fest of epic overreaction.

(EDIT: /u/Coltorl- points out below that though the request was made on one blog, several gaming pubs picked up on it)

(EDIT 2: It looks like the two articles in question on Kotaku and Daily Dot were more about the vast and pretty hateful over-reaction to a seemingly benign question on the MedievalPOC site, rather than actual serious requests on the part of press for Daniel Vavra to include PoC in his game.  So my original point stands.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Regular reminder that this is the publication where Alexander Macris personally conducted interviews with devs, and then pushed through the article with the byline **Escapist Staff**.  

The Escapist Staff had no real involvement in the interviews or the selection of interview subjects. It was basically an attempt by Macris to hide behind a publication byline to lend his set of interviews the weight of a publication's credibility.

It was not only cowardly, but incredibly sketchy, when it later came out that Macris donated money to one of the devs that was interviewed.

It was basically a disaster for all involved, was the first major step in drowning The Escapist's reputation in a gutter of pandering and shit, and at the center of it all is what appears to be an unrepentant Alexander Macris.

Who, in an Escapist forum thread complaining about their latest hiringsI mean non-employee potentially regular contributors (http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/18.871054-A-professional-objective-apolitical-future-for-The-Escapist?page=9#21836458
) wrote:

 Lizzy and Brandon Morse are writing articles. They are not employees or news writers. As I've said elsewhere, we've downsized on both employees and news writers and aren't staffing up right now.

 Nor are they writing political work for us. Josh and I are quite serious that we don't want the Escapist to be political. That means we don't want it to be left-wing OR right-wing.

Which, of course, makes total sense given that Morse has no real history of game writing, and his main claim to notoriety and relationship with gaming is his political and cultural views on feminism, gamergate, and everything in between.

*So what's going on with The Escapist?*

My guess is that Alexander Macris is either (1) showing his true colors and sympathies now that Greg Tito and other writers are gone, or (2) desperately pandering to a reactionary extremist minority in order to boost page views.  I almost prefer option 1, because option 2 is just depressingly sad for a publication of Escapist's once sizable stature. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's the funny thing: in the beginning, press outlets *did* take some of the issues of ethics from GamerGate supporters seriously.  In fact, both Kotaku and Polygon *both* acknowledged that their stances on Patreon needed some changing, and modified their ethics policies.

So yes, Mark Kern, the press did address ethics -- or at least those parts they felt were realistically relevant and true.  

But you know what?  That was over *half a year ago*.  And surprise, surprise, GG is still on going and the increasingly strident and desperate pleas for "ETHICS"while openly mocking feminists and "SJWS" and similarly other "no-really-we're-left-ring-progressives-ignore-baldwin" actionshas not abated.

So what did the press learn from that?  That GamerGate is truly about a lot of things, but ethics isn't one of them. </TEXT>

Ugh, that's horrible and shitty.

 This petition is not just about yellow journalism in gaming press, but also about how such journalism does nothing to solve this type of harassment. Instead, it drives people apart, trying to put them into boxes or labels and pit them against each other for nothing other than traffic and profit. To solve these issues, the press has to bring us together, positively and constructively, with serious journalism. 

Okay, fine, I'll hear you out on the "serious journalism" that will address the harassment your employee received.

 Kotaku and Polygon, lets not start with "games are bad and getting worse" lets start with "games are great, and can even be better."

Wait. What?  Mark Kern, did you try that with your employee?  **"Hey Jane, I know you've been harassed in terrible ways by our community, but remember, games are great!  Let's figure out how to make them even better!"**

Seriously, did you?

<TEXT> I agree, what's the point of placing a woman character  into a cold weather stage if she's not in a tank top.  My best female friend told me that it's just not very realistic at all.

Anyway, having read through your very long and insightful post, I can tell that you are being very serious, and display an obvious passion for gaming.  Not like Crystal Dynamics.  Going to boycott them now.  The status quo is there for a reason, its just capitalism.  If SJWs really wanted something like that, why don't they start their own country or something.  Like a Marxist country.  I don't think that's ever been done before, so maybe finally SJWs would try something _new_.

I don't really  mind that the original is influencing the new one and that trauma plays a part in the game, but at least make it objective.  I mean, what is trauma, really? According to the 17th century philosopher scientist Sir Jain Bain of the Boors, trauma is really just this gaze that we look at shadows at the back of a cave in a tree, just a reflection of the insecurities of the people looking inside the tree.  Why can't developers be more confident and just do what they want.

I think her boobs are fine.  You don't want to go overboard with boobs, like really I think her boobs are probably the right size.  I hope there's an option to remove the coat though, because what's the point of giving a female good proportioned boobs if you can't see them at some point.

Anyway, I'm pretty neutral in this and don't really care about any of it, but just my thoughts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For a supposed IT manager, I hope you never use the "simple and easy!" line with your employees without putting more thought than the amount you've demonstrated here.

Ammo count is stored as fractions because different weapons have different magazine and reserve ammo sizes.  If ammo was stored as flat values, switching from a 1 magazine rocket with 3 reserve rockets to a machine gun would give you 1 bullet with 3 reserve bullets.

<TEXT> The one thing i never understood about the "conspiracy" is that in order for the conspiracy to make sense, the smallest atomic unit of time in the modern world must be "day".  Or maybe "5 days".

Because there's no other explanation for how an article, reactions and reposts and subsequent unrelated articles that were published over a course of *days* could be considered "coming out at the same time" and "coordinated". </TEXT>

<TEXT> Even car reviews have an element of emotional resonance.  Hell, phones too.  I've ready many car reviews from many places where a car "not feeling BMW-ish" or "an interior not at the level I expected from Audi" carries significant weight in the final analysis.

Even things like cooking knives and pots and pans can sometimes have emotional resonance with reviews.  Plenty of "this lodge pan is as good as my Le Creuset but *it's no Le Creuset*.

Pens have "ink feel" and "flow", phones have "ease of use", "overall experience", hell digital camera reviews have things like "this Leica *feels* like a Leica".

It's utterly silly to expect a reviewer to take the.. reviewer out of the review.  It's not possible.  Beyond a strict factual description of technical specs and dimensions, an aspect of emotional evaluation of the product gets injected at some level into every single review I can think of for pretty much any product. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  There is a ton of fighting in the story, but Kenshin is all about not wanting to fight and preserving his vow not to kill anymore.

The problem wish Kenshin as a pacifist vehicle however, is that the manga/anime is billed as an action/shounen work, so inevitably despite not wanting to fight Kenshin still does it. Nearly every time.

And it definitely does not satisfy the OP's request of "do not also betray their morals as a necessary ingredient for the protagonist's victory?"

Kenshin basically engages in (true, non-fatal usually) combat in every encounter eventually. </TEXT>

<TEXT> After many, many years of apt/condo/shared living, here's the key to doing what you want to do: talk to your neighbors.

Seriously, that's all there is to it.  Work out schedules.  Neighbors sleep at 10pm? Okay, don't pump the bass at midnight.  Neighbors tell you that weekends are fair game? Blast that music.  Have a party on a Friday that you think will run late with music going? Just tell your neighbors and work out a date.  

I've rarely found people super un-accommodating provided some common sense courtesy and respect for shared living is shown.

If the neighbors are friendly, and you are worried, I've also found it helps (if they're willing) to actually go into your neighboring units and see how much sound leaks out. 

It's mutually beneficial.  They get to see how their noise habits affect you, and you get to verify what levels of volume gets tranferred to adjacent units. </TEXT>

<TEXT> FYI, the opinion section officially started in January with the hire of Kuchera.  It didn't initially have the About Page or the existing opinion piece branding.  Part of the motivation for having that about page and the general big giant OPINION branding in giant letters is that despite an article obviously being an editorial due to tone and title, and despite an article living in the opinion section and written by the opinion editor, people were still constantly mistaking it as news/representative of Polygon as a whole or of staff not involved with the piece, and sending in nasty emails or engaging in pretty terrible behavior elsewhere.

(I've found this sort of selective myopia on what is or isn't an opinion to be mostly based on how much you disagree/agree with the opinion, and also, sadly, mostly universal and separate from any specific GamerGate traits)

So well, when relative subtlety doesn't work, just hit them on the head over and over again that it's an opinion piece.  It's unfortunate that it feels like little like a Caution: Hot warning on coffee, but it sometimes does help because the response can just be: read the giant white letters and read this page. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Perhaps you should clarify that this guy doesn't represent the views of the rest of the company?

So, like, I get your sentiment. I really do. It's immensely frustrating when someone from a company that is big or that you like says something you disagree with.  But the whole "do you want this person representing your company?" thing is stupid.

It should be obvious by now that unless you are specifically saying something about your company and some part of your company's stance, you are always, *always* speaking for yourself.

This doesn't need to be called out.  (And in any case, the EthanJamesPetty has it called out in his Twitter bio that his views don't represent Ubisoft)

Of course, in cases like Xbro, this is different.  Xbro specifically, explicitly stated what he thought the opinions of others in the Microsoft were on GamerGate.  In his role as an employee of MS, he was, in multiple interviews, *actually* speaking for portions of the company.  He used his employer as a platform to amplify his views and position.

Which is why I don't mind people worked up about Xbro but think that just because someone says something disagreeable on Twitter -- without bringing in their employer -- it doesn't mean its a reflection on their company.

(Obviously, I'm not including instances where a person makes direct threats to others. In which case, IMO, if someone wanted to say to their employer "yo, look at what this person is doing", fine by me, stop making personal threats.  But AFAIK, Ethan James Petty never did that.  He has some views on Twitter I think are befitting of assholes and people I probably wouldn't like, but I never saw the kind of tweets that exemplify why GamerGate is so venomous.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Was initially hesitant about the brown and gray colors because I was afraid it was going to be more brown and silver.  Worries were unfounded however, because it is an IMO gorgeous light gunmetal gray.

I'm running this at the office off of an Fiio E10 connect to my laptop.    Currently, it's hooked up to an AKG 271 and an ATH-M50x.

Really liking the MDR1A so far. By far the most comfy headphones of the bunch I wear (though the 271 comes in a close second due to the self adjusting headband and velour pads).  

In terms of sound, I find the signature and overall tone very pleasing.  The bass is just right for me (the 271 was very much lacking in that regard, while the M50x was pretty good).  Obviously haven't put many hours into it yet, but early imprssions are positive.

(Photo taken with a friend's Fuji X-T1 that he just purchased.  So aside from headphone lust, I now have a whole new set of camera lust feels I need to deal with) </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem with spikes in traffics (which is what I assume happens when she asks for donations) is that if the traffic is too much, you'll see similar effects to DDoS attacks: slow responses, overloaded databases, saturated pipes.  

It's important to note that (in the tweet provided) Anita didn't say that this is a DDoS.  Merely that her website is down.  Now, that's objectively true.  If you consider that a "website" is the sum of the parts of the database server and the web application server, then one being up doesn't mean anything: without the database, the website is functionally dead.

Of course, if GamerGate folks want to be extremely pedantic, technically, yes, her webserver is responding to connections while her database is down.  But it amounts to the same thing: her website is functionally useless. </TEXT>

i definitely believe that a good culture is able to foster amazing work, but part of a good culture is an accepting culture.

I agree with the setting, but unfortunately, I don't know if I agree with the potential.  TT did a smart thing with TWD by creating a pretty good gulf between game and show/comic.  

But it looks like with GoT, they are aiming directly at the established fanbase -- and by doing so, put immense pressure on their own original narrative from existing Song of Ice and Fire characters and plotlines.

I'd almost rather if they took Westeros the setting but not GoT the time period. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is your own story in the sense that these characters aren't really following a given plotline from the books or shows.

But I agree that it's not nearly as free as TWD from the comics, or Wolf from Fables.  

Due to the fact that TT set this game in the middle of Song of Ice and Fire proper, there's immense narrative pressure from the existing characters and plot points.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> It sounds like to me they just thought the opening was lackluster -- I mean, their problems with ep 1 are right there in the review:

 Characters and events are often brought up seemingly to remind the viewer that they're in Westeros, and not enough time is spent making us care about House Forrester before the characters are put in danger both direct and existential.

 It feels like a slow episode of the show and, although the story could go into a few interesting directions, as it stands it often feels like you're simply standing on the periphery of much greater struggles.

I think Telltale did a wonderful job with TWD in crafting a series of episodes that felt *important* from the get go, and not just a tertiary side story in a large narrative being played out somewhere else.

I think that's going to be much harder to do with GoT.  I'm certainly going to be playing it because I love both the books and tv episodes, but at the same time, I don't think I'll ever truly forget that this is, ultimately, a side story.

I don't know if that worry or feeling warrants a 6.5, but on the other hand, I acknowledge that it is a potential downer for what sounds like a decent but ultimately slow start to the season. 

EDIT: To the point about "Got" and "any who knows anything about it", I think that's true.  But I also think that you can have a lot of fun with TWD or Wolf or even the new Borderlands without knowing very much about the setting beforehand.  You don't have to be a fan of TWD or Fables or Borderlands *before* the game to enjoy the game.  So I definitley think it's valid criticism.  Perhaps TT set out to pen a letter to GoT fans with this new series -- I certainly wouldn't mind it.  But as an actual game available for purchase, I think it's also fair to judge its approachability compared to other TT games. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's what I call the parent-syndrome.  GamerGate wants, in their own unique age-appropriate take on the world, wants "Gawker's mom" to take them to task for perceived bad practices.

It's the kind of thinking wherein emailing advertisers and trying to get writers (and other opponents) fired makes snse.  It's the "I'M GOING TO TELL YOUR PARENTS" thinking that they seem to be unable to shake off.  

They appear to think that the only reason they have not been taken seriously is that they have not yet appealed to a high enough power.

<TEXT> You're a gamer if you call yourself a gamer.  It's honestly as simple as that, IMO.

Gamer isn't a title that has rigorous requirements or some sort of qualification stage.  It's like calling yourself a foodie.  If you care enough about food to actually want to self label as a foodie, then go for it.

Sure, some people -- other foodies, other gamers -- might scoff and say "you aren't a *real* gamer", but that's fine.  To others, they are't either.  You can always get more hardcore.

But labels like "gamer" and "foodie" have much more to do with self-categorization than third-party categorization according to a set of rules (rules that also change from person to person). </TEXT>

<TEXT>  matt Taylor probably assumed that considering his female friend seemed fine with it he thought it was okay

It's important to note that she gave it to him *for his birthday*, as a gift.  That's it.  Period.  According to her, she was just as surprised as anyone else when he wore her shirt live, in public, for the world to see.  It wasn't a gift for him to wear to work, it wasn't a celebration of landing a comet shirt, it was a birthday gift.

There was no approval, implicit or otherwise, given from the maker of the shirt to Matt Taylor to wear his shirt at the time and context that he did.

The irrelevance of who made the shirt and why aside, I generally agree that he wore the shirt, he gave a sincere apology.  And the world, for the most part, has moved on.  Except for those who extremely offended *on his behalf* who can't seem to let it go. </TEXT>

<TEXT> (Caveat I *absolutely* agree that you should not preorder if you cannot cancel the preorder or otherwise get out of it)

So while I get this, I'm still going to pre-order games at Amazon.  Why? Because it's to my advantage.

1. I can still cancel the pre-order without any issue usually by the time reviews come out (Amazon doesn't ship the game until 1-2 days before its launch date)

2. Even if I forget to cancel the pre-order, I can (and have on some occasions) simply refused shipment to return the game to Amazon.

3. I still get pre-order perks.

4. It saves me the the ordeal of having to go into a Gamestop or Best Buy if I want a physical copy on launch day.

Yes, I realize that I can simply wait until launch day and then order from Amazon and only get it a few days late.  But why?

<TEXT> I get what you're trying to say, but things like:

 Even without any elisp knowledge, emacs is superior at editing text. The only thing other editors have are more "normal" keybindings and plugins that are easier to install

show a startling ignorance of what other editors can do out of the box.  Things like workable multiple major modes (Textmate did this particularly well when it was first released), interestin snippet systems (in fact, clones of Textmate's snippet system are popular plugins for both Emacs and Vim), multi-cursor editing (Sublime Text refined the UI of this action so that it was relatively intuitive for most), centralized package and plugin upgrade/config screens (Atom is doing a pretty great job of managing their plugin ecosystem).

I get that you like Emacs a lot.  But I think it's also beneficial for us Emacs users (I personally use Emacs with Evil for vim keybindings, because I think native Emacs keybindings are atrocious) to step outside the cave once in a while and see what's out there.

<TEXT> Generally, my favorite fantasy books draw me on one or more of these things: sharp dialogue, deep magical systems/settings, honest character growth that extends to beyond the standard fantasy "powering-up" tropes, a sense of history to the world -- something that makes it feel lived in, or a complex protagonist isn't defined by a notion of being "good" or "evil".

Not all my favorites have all of these, of course. And many of them probably actively lack some of the things I mentioned -- but thinking about it, they all tend to exhibit one or more of the things I mentioned above.

Examples:

David Eddings' books don't, to put it favorably, have the most original narratives or magic systems.  What they do have though are passages of dialogue that I find pretty delightful.

Terry Pratchett's Discworld books have a land that feels lived in, has amazing dialogue, and actually a surprising amount of character growth for some. 

Malazan is obtuse, complex, and honestly hard to get into.  But I loved it.  The world felt like it existed before I started reading.  It felt realized.

The Coldfire trilogy by C.S. Friedman had an amazing world, and probably one of the most fascinating characters in fantasy that I can remember in the form of Gerald Tarrant.

Similarly, I loved Logan Ninefingers in Abercrombie's First Law books -- and in the Red Country followup. </TEXT>

Pretty much everything written by Charles De Lint, particularly his Newford books.  Many of these are less action oriented, but still just as focused on infusing magic in a modern world.

<TEXT> I'm sorry if William Usher has never been in the position to have been approached by a recruiter from another company offering lots and lots of money to quit and join up with a different company, but it's not exactly uncommon in almost any field.  

I'm not seeing any connect Riot has with Polygon *from his screenshot* that is beyond "recruiters at Riot sent emails to Polygon editorial staff asking if they'd be willing to join Riot for lots and lots of money."

I mean, that's headhunting 101.  What, exactly, is the controversy?

I mean, recruiters from tons of companies have approached me, and none of it means my company has any monetory relationship with the company the recruiters represent. </TEXT>

<TEXT> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_the_Five_Magics

An earlier thread asking about books focused on mages/magic reminded me of this novel, and it's sequels.  It was probably amongst my favorite "magic-oriented" books growing up.  

I loved the breakdown of the different types of magic.  It doesn't match the complexity of many of the modern magic systems in terms of mechanical depth, but I loved it conceptually.

(The other "magicky" books I read in and loved my formative years was Jack Vance's Dying Earth novels.  I read them shortly after getting heavily into AD D, and then got my mind promptly blown when I realized the magic system was basically lifted from the Dying Earth stories) </TEXT>

<TEXT> IMO, Metacritic correlates with sales for a couple of reasons:

1. Highly rated games tend to sell well, because they are good.  

2. Gaming consumers put (probably more than they should) a lot of weight into Metacritic scores, and review scores in general.  I know for a while when I didn't have a lot of time or money after college, I just trolled metacritic every couple of months and only looked at games with  8. 

I actually think Steam user reviews are some of the best in the industry for precisely one reason: they put how many hours the user has played of the game.

That user review with 4 hours into Skyrim? Yeah, probably not super trustworthy.  That user review with 40+ or even 100+ hours into Skyrim? Yeah, probably worth reading.

(Though that also brings up self-selecting bias issues, where users with high numbers of hours into a game will be necessarily more favorable to that game) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Gamasutra, Google Adsense, Google DFP, and GamerGate's misunderstandings of Google's Ad products </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **TL;DR: The act of serving ads is complex, and often misunderstood by many people, especially GamerGaters.**

**TL;DR list of links to read for info**

Overiew of DFP: https://support.google.com/dfp_sb/answer/6022000?hl=en ref_topic=6021031 rd=1

Common concepts in online advertising servers: https://support.google.com/dfp_sb/answer/6021064?hl=en

Some common terminology: https://support.google.com/dfp_sb/answer/6012282?hl=en

A whitepaper on just how, exactly, an ad is chosen and served: https://support.google.com/dfp_premium/answer/1143651?hl=en

*****

Been seeing a lot of FUD being spread by GG supporters about Adsense, and what it means.  So, a brief explainer.

**Google Adsense** is an *ad network* operated by Google. **Google DFP** is an *ad server* operated by Google.  This is also known as Doubleclick for Publishers.

These are separate offerings that are tied closely together because they are both owned by Google.  They are, however, still distinct products.

Checking Gamasutra's page source, there's heavy evidence that they are using Google DFP, and not straight Adsense tags.  What does this mean?

Here's how Google describes Adsense vs DFP. From https://support.google.com/dfp_sb/answer/112651?hl=en: 

 With Google AdSense, you can display contextually-relevant, unobtrusive Google ads on your website's pages to earn money. With DFP Small Business, you can manage your directly-sold and network-based online advertising inventory in addition to Google AdSense.

Google also provides a handy table comparing the two products at the end of this page:

https://support.google.com/dfp_sb/answer/6022000?hl=en ref_topic=6021031 rd=1

And if you're really curious about some standard terminology in the world of online ads, here's a a good page about DFP terms (though many of these are pretty common to the industry): 

https://support.google.com/dfp_sb/answer/6012282?hl=en

And lastly, if you are still curious about online ads and how they are delivered, Google has a pretty handy white paper that goes over the basics: https://support.google.com/dfp_premium/answer/1143651?hl=en

**Some important things to take away:**

1. Adsense and DFP are not mutually exclusive but are also not the same thing.  Adsense is an ad network.  Google DFP is an ad server that is capable of using the Adsense network to serve ads.

2. To further distinguish DFP from Adsense, there's nothing requiring a user of Google DFP to actually use the Adsense network. Many sites do, however, and Google even has a page explaining why somemight might want to turn on Adsense for their DFP ad units: https://support.google.com/dfp_sb/answer/112640?hl=en

3. The code for rendering ads using Google DFP essentially matches up to what Gamasutra uses for their ad slot rendering.

4. Most importantly, the code that is used does not change whether or not the ad is sourced from Adsense or an existing DFP line item.  All the code does is fill in a designated payload into a designated ad slot.  This mean that if a GamerGater says "this is obviously Adsense code because an Adsense ad is generated", it is false. The same exact code, unmodified, is also capable of serving up non-Adsense ads.

**It's just Adsense! says the sneering GamerGater**

Now, I've seen "Adsense" used as a derogatory moniker for Gamastura ads.  "It's just adsense!" is a pretty common refrain from GamerGaters.  It's silly. 

First, as evidenced, Gamasutra is using DFP to serve their ads, not Adsense. So a more accurate refrain woudl be "It's just DFP!"  Which is even more silly, because DFP is used by sites for their ad needs that get tens to hundreds of millions of page hits a month.  

Second, an ad does not need to run 100% of the time in an ad slot to be a direct buy (or **order**, using DFP terminology) from an advertiser.  There are all sorts of targeting that can be applied.  This is getting into the weeds a bit, but here is a good page describing all the ways that can be targeted, including a section on custom criteria that basically means you can use almost anything: https://support.google.com/dfp_sb/answer/2884033?hl=en ref_topic=1655865

Beyond targeting, line items typically have goals based on type.  Here is a good page going over the basics: https://support.google.com/dfp_premium/answer/177279?hl=en

In short, standard line items have impression goals, which Google will then use to determine if a specific ad is shown or not based on forecasting.  Specifically:

 For directly sold campaigns with defined start and end dates and specific impression goals. DFP will speed up or slow down delivery to meet the goal.

**Remnant ads**

Another common GamerGate refrain is that Intel is probably Adsense because Adsense ads show in the same slot as the Intel ad.  This is also silly.

First, remnant ads.  Remnant ads are ads that are typically shown when there are no direct by ads shown.  In DFP, this is managed by priority.  Standard direct buys are normally high or medium priority.  Remnant ads are low priority ads that basically fill up empty ad space if there are no other higher priority line items to server.

To reiterate a link above, here is a handy white paper by Google that goes over what precisely happens when ads are served: https://support.google.com/dfp_premium/answer/1143651?hl=en

Now, I don't know how many of Gamastura's ads are direct sells vs remnant ads (besides Intel, which they've confirmed as a direct sell), but assuming that Gamasutra does have remnant advertising, this means that *Adsense ads might be served in the same slot as Intel ads*.  Why?

Here's Google (https://support.google.com/dfp_premium/answer/177279?hl=en):

 If AdSense or Ad Exchange line items are enabled for your network, these line items compete on price with other low-priority line items. If an AdSense or Ad Exchange line item is available to serve and has a higher price than any available network, bulk, or price priority line item, the AdSense or Ad Exchange line item will be served.

In the whitepaper referenced earlier, this is covered in great detail in part 5, "Choosing the best line item to serve". 

So, here is a hypothetical scenario that has no real basis in what Gamasutra might actually be doing because I don't know what their line items are.  But this is a pretty easy scenario to think through.  Imagine Gamasutra has only one standard line item of medium priority, that being the Intel direct buy.  (They very likely have much more than that, but let's keep it simple).  

If that Intel ad gets enough impressions for the day according to DFP's calculations and forecasting, then to avoid overserving the ad, DFP might decide that to use Adsense ads instead, based on the line item selection critera mentioned above.

<TEXT> The worst part is, it's not even AdSense.  I've had to correct several GG supporters repeatedly on this.

Gamasutra is using Google DFP, an *Ad Server*, which, among other things, can use Ad Sense, an *Ad Network* for ads.  However, the source for ads served through Google DFP may look superficially like standard AdSense calls as both invoke "google".

<TEXT> That the Intel ad did not come from Google Adsense. Yes, it did come from Google.  But Google offers multiple advertising products, and Adsense is not the only one.  

More importantly, the advertising framework that Gamasutra uses (Google DFP) allows for both Adsense *and* targeted campaigns like a sponsored Intel ad. 

So whereas William Usher is right on one count (Gamasutra is using Google for ads), he is wrong with the conclusion (that therefore the Intel ad must be adsense and not under Gamasutra's direct control).

<TEXT> This subreddit is obviously a group.  Sure, "anti-GG" as a *thing* doesn't really exist, in so much as there's not a counter-reactionary organization in opposition to GamerGate.

But I think, as this point, it not terribly beyond reason so say that there are groups of people who are much more say, invested, in being opponents of GamerGate than your average non-GamerGater.

Are we bound by a common ideology? Not really.  But there's still a group, bound by a common purpose.  Maybe the purpose is to mock GamerGate. Maybe the purpose is to oppose GamerGate.  Depends on who you ask.  But we're here, on this subreddit with 3.2k subscribers.  We're a group.

And that's essentially who I'm talking about when I say "we" in what you quoted.  Not "Anti-GG" we.  We, as in this subreddit.  We, as in this subreddit, who like to make fun of GamerGate extremist rants.  We, as a subreddit, who like to condemn stupid hyperbolic statements by GamerGate supporters.

And now we have a hyperbolic rant *against* GamerGate.  That's how it cuts our way. We don't typically mock extremist statements against GamerGate, but imagine for a second if that exact same tone and language was on a KiA post.  It'd be front page material for days. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First, Adsense allows for direct buys that show 100% of the time: https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/3064395?hl=en  

So Gamastura using Adsense does not actually disprove their claim in any way.

Second, Google also has other products besides Adsense.  DFP, detailed below, is another.

Gamasutra could be using Doubleclick (http://www.google.com/doubleclick/advertisers/), possibly via DFP (http://www.google.com/doubleclick/publishers/welcome/), which has the ability to do more complicated ad buys that, yes, can run targeted campaigns.

Evidence:

Ad creative source: http://i.imgur.com/8jVNtei.png

Gamasutra uses Google's GPT tags, which are used with Doubleclick (https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-gpt/ ):

<TEXT> There's angry ranting, and then there's this.  

Chris Kluwe's oft linked rant on Medium was a proper, something-I-can-defend rant.  He called GamerGate names, yes.  He called them a lot of names.  But he also didn't go at lengths to describe how he thinks they should all die -- and then reiterate that same sentiment several paragraphs later.

In fact, I'd be fine with Tait's rant if he just stopped shy of repeatedly suggesting that all GamerGater's should die.  I mean, c'mon, seriously. That's not cool. I get that he's angry, that much of the rant is probably grandstanding and a written form of high drama, but seriously.  It's not cool.

Radical, militant extremism is a double edged sword, and it just cut our way.

NOTE: this doesn't mean that Tait should, in turn, be receiving death threats or the like.  It doesn't work like that.  I condemn his piece for going too far, but I also condemn the harassment that he, and the people who liked his post, have faced. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I generally like head shots, but there are a few places where I think the concept of head shots is used as a crutch in lieu of more interesting weak spot mechanics.

Destiny, for example, does head shots both well in some places and poorly in others.  

In some enemies, the "headshot" location is the head.  In others, like the Vex, the headshot location is in the chest.  I think that's a nice change, and forces the player to not just rely on muscle memory to aim for the head against every mob.

On the other hand, Destiny also uses the concept of the "headshot" or "single weak spot on an enemy" poorly in many of its boss fights.  Most of Destiny's bosses have a location where you deal critical, or headshot damage. This is offset by massive health.

I think that there's potential for much more interesting boss mechanics than just the basic hide, strafe, and shoot the "head" of the boss loop.  

Zelda, in particular, tend to have pretty interesting boss fights, though admittedly Zelda has more boss-unique tools to work with. </TEXT>

The general gist: 

Agree that games reviews have been traditionally consumer advice pieces.  I think of it as the product review vs the experiential review.   I think both are valid ways to approach reviews. 

I think, currently, some sites are trying to approach reviews from a more experiential side -- more about what the reviewer felt while playing the game than a product breakdown of the game as w hole.

I think that's fine, and that people just need to decide what kind of reviews they like, and find a site that does it that way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that's true, in the same way that exceptional (or exceptionally awful) cinematography or music in film are mentioned in film reviews.

But, I think here's where it differs:

Traditionally, game reviews have been focused on technical prowess with bits of the reviewer's experience thrown in.

Traditionally, film reviews are experiential reviews that primarily talk about the reviewer's thoughts and experience watching the film.  Mention of specific breakdowns like music and special effects are typically only as supporting evidence for the experience the reviewer felt.

ie, the special effects in Final Fantasy: Spirits Within only served to highlight the uncanny valley feeling I had the entire time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think both you and him are talking about Reviews, just two different types. I like to call it the product review vs the experiential review.

Traditionally, game reviews have been product reviews.  ie, does this game work, does this game satisfy expectations going in, how does this game look, etc.

Traditionally, film/art reviews have been experiential reviews. What did I feel when watching this? After watching it, what am I feeling now? What about the film did I like/didn't like?

Both are entirely valid forms of review, and I wouldn't label either the "true" review.  Because they are just different kinds of reviews.

Personally, I favor the experiential review for games.  But it's perfectly fine to favor product reviews, too. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Metacritic proprietary score weighting </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-12 16:35:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Disclaimer: if you look through my post history, you'll see I'm pretty openly anti-GG.  But that said, this is a post from me attempting to highlight what I think is an actual issues in games journalism.  Journalism ethics issue? Probably not, strictly speaking. 

**Background:**

Metacritic, when "averaging" their scores, assigns different publications different weights.  It's a proprietary system, with weights and tiers that have never been confirmed or officially revealed to the public.  What this means it that Metacritic's "average" is actually closer to a FICO score -- a proprietary score under the control of Metacritic, rather than a straight mathematical average.

http://www.metacritic.com/about-metascores

 Metascore is a weighted average in that we assign more importance, or weight, to some critics and publications than others, based on their quality and overall stature. In addition, for music and movies, we also normalize the resulting scores (akin to "grading on a curve" in college), which prevents scores from clumping together.

Last year, Full Sail did a study on this, and gave a talk about at at the GDC: https://archive.today/KSAXb  (Gamasutra link)

Metacritic's response (https://archive.today/Sbd12) denies the accuracy of Full Fail's estimates of site weight and tiers.

**My position:**

With the power given to Metacritic scores by both the gaming industry (ie, New Vegas), the gaming consumers ("what is this game's metacritic score"), and the gaming press (some publications have more power over the Metacritic score than others), it feels wrong to me that this is a proprietary score, without any accountability other than what Metacritic puts on itself.

There's no visibility into how a score is determined, no consumer/readership voice as to, in Metacritic's own words, a critic's "quality and overall stature". These are things determined solely by Metacritic without input from the public.

We should be asking Metacritic to be more open with their internal weights.  

We should be asking Metacritic to investigate more ways to allow players to give input about score, and critic weighting.

We should be asking ourselves why we put so much faith into a proprietary score system that might give more weight to publications we don't agree with, in the first place.

(In the case of GamerGate, you can certainly bet that many of the sites y'all don't like are in the highest weight group, and many of the sites y'all do like might not be shown at all or are in a low weight group)

<TEXT>  Polygon does, but Metacritic scores are weighed, and it has been calculated by outsiders that Polygon likely belongs to the Reviewers with the lowest weight

FWIW, the one study about metacritic score weights was done by Full Sail last year, and used Metacritic data that cut off before Polygon was founded.

So I'm not entirely sure where your info comes from. </TEXT>

That's because archive.today grabs content from a third party machine.

If this was truly a "private FB", then achive.today **won't** give away the source because all archive.today would fetch is the public version of Nick Denton's feed, that everyone can see.

<TEXT> To be fair, Patreon isn't exactly like Kickstarted or similar games. Not always, anyway.  There are many Patreons that are used to fund writing, or a bunch of other endeavors not strictly related to "making a game".

IMO, Patreon is exactly what it sounds like: being a patron for someone, financially, because you think given the time and money, that person is capable of producing work that you find interesting.

Personally, I think it should be disclosed -- but not prohibited -- by journalists writing about people they have backed on Patreon.  The nature of Patreon is that backing someone is implicitly supporting them *as a person*, vs something like Kickstarter where the argument for backing something *as a product* is much stronger. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So while I generally agree with your sentiment, I also think there are very real effects that Twitter and other social media have had on the transmission of things like GamerGate.

In 1992, or even in 2007 to a lesser degree, your average person who is angry had a harder time finding like-minded people online.  

That said, I really do think that "feminism", being socially progressive, and criticism of games as a cultural artifacts, and a general misunderstanding -- purposeful or not -- of what those things actually mean are resulting in GamerGate.

It's obviously not about "ethics", as ethics is not some sort sort of binary achievement that a person, or publication, has or does not have.  

It's part of the same mindset that the recent catcalling Youtube video has garnered. It's proponents, many of whom would probably support GamerGate in principle, lead to interviews like this: www.buzzfeed.com/adamdavis/this-guy-mansplained-catcalling-on-cnn-and-got-totally-shut

But the key thing for me is that with today's social networks and the unique way that Twitter acts as both soapbox, megaphone and mailbox at the same time, along with articles like the above buzzfeed piece, a culture of  escalation of outrage is only prevalent, but also encouraged.  

Outrage has become the currency of the internet.  So it's not terribly surprisingly for me -- though disappointing -- that GamerGate is not focused on ethics, but outrage. </TEXT>

http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-11-02-digital-foundry-hands-on-with-halo-the-master-chief-collection

 The Master Chief Collection is in the house - the single-player elements final, with multiplayer and co-op currently being fixed up via that forthcoming 20GB Day One patch. With embargoes firmly in place and the multiplayer modes still being polished off as we write, what we can tell you about this fascinating package is limited but enlightening nonetheless.

Eurogamer's wording is a little vague on whether or not multiplayer at all was available to try, or if its just problematic, with the day 1 patch fixing it up.

Either way, yes, it looks like prior to the 20gb Day 1 patch, the multiplayer aspect of Halo:MCC will not be representative of the final product. </TEXT>

Anyway, I'm sure there is a difference with Titanfall at 1440p. I'm not going to tell you that there isn't.  But I don't care as much as you do.  I don't think my experience with Titanfall would have been significantly improved with higher res or framerate.  

But if you care, more power to you.  

I'm just saying that I don't, but if all other things are equal, then naturally I spring for the higher res/framerate (the PS4 version in most cases where cross-platform games arent equal) because why wouldn't I. </TEXT>

Mostly because even if I don't care about resolution, if games are the same price, why not opt for the higher res/higher framerate version?

<TITLE> Reading a site's content via archive.today is an intellectual dishonest way of "boycotting" </TITLE>

<TEXT> It's not a tactic unique to GamerGate.  I've seen it for a long, long time from all kinda of people for all kinds of causes.  And it irks the hell out of me every time I see it.

If you want to boycott something, just do it.  Don't visit the site.  Don't read the site's content.

Using archive.today or the like to "get the content" while not "rewarding the site" is intellectually dishonest at best.  It's saying you disagree with the site enough to want to boycott it, but are curious enough about its content to warrant reading.  It's saying you HATE clickbait articles, but will still "click" them via archive.today to read the content.

This is like me saying I'm going to boycott Modern Warfare 2 and then going out and downloading a pirated copy.

If you say you are boycotting something, then mean it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I first played Wing Commandergames, one of the things I loved was the way that failing a mission didn't mean replaying that mission -- it (sometimes, I don't think every mission was optional) moved on with the assumption that I had failed.

Similarly, I played Fire Emblem the same way.  Not having a perfect battle and losing a character meant *losing* that character.

On the a different spectrum, SimCity and games like that dealth with failure my making me play better next time.  Sandbox games like that means I learn, over time through multiple sessions, what things work the best.

In fact, some of the best times I've had in sandbox games are when I make a mistake and have to recover from it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right, perhaps games being interactive is that distinction, or perhaps it isn't.  The fact is there's been precious few articles or even talk on most gaming boards about this.

Personally, I think this discussion about the purpose of reviews -- and how that purpose informs how a review is written -- is much more constructive than simply calling for the boycotting of any site writing a review you don't like. (I'm not saying you did it, but it's hard to deny that the sentiment exists).

One can, truthfully, say that don't want the critic's experience in a review, but rather wants what the critic think's the consumer's experience woud be.  That's fine.  That's a stance a reviewer on a site can write towards.

One can, also, truthfully say that want an experiential review, one where they want to hear about the critic's reaction to the game first hand, without any consideration for how readers might play that game.  That's also fine.  That's the model many film reviews follow.

I think the problem, then, comes from expecting sites to all follow the first model.  You can disagree with the site -- god knows I disagree with plenty of reviews everywhere in any medium (games, movies, books).  I've watched/read (and liked!) my share of critically panned films and novels.

That's why it's so bewildering to me when peopel get so mad at a review, so enraged that they start attacking the site.  

Reviews are not a value judgement on the people buying that game.  I feel just as good buying Destiny as I do buying Mordor.  I feel just as good watching (and liking!) the latest Transformers movie as I do when watching the much better reviewed Guardians of the Galaxy.

Anyway, I think that tension between game as product and game as experience is an immensely interesting one, and one I'd love to hear and read more about in various places.  I think it marks the beginnings of a real shift in how we see games -- not as merely products to spend time with, but actual cultural forces that critics (and players) can discus and talk about in the same way I discuss and talk about films and movies with friends.

Obviously, some won't want or like that shift, that's that perfectly fine.  The discussion about that shift is more interesting to me than whether or not one supports the shift. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gies' review of Bayonetta 2 are his own -- he doesn't, and I'd argue shouldn't, be letting any one else's opinion of the game color his own opinions of the game.

But I think you actually touch on something interesting: should review's treat games as a product or as art?

Traditionally, games press has approached games as a product -- how are the graphics, how are the mechanics, does this games do what the game devs say that it would do.

But if you look at film reviews or book reviews or other reviews of artistic works, the majority (maybe vast majority) of them are *experiential* reviews.  Meaning, the critic's review is purely about the critic's experiences while watching/reading the item in question.  In many ways, the fundamental focus of a film review is not on the film watcher, but on the reaction of the film critic.

I think there's tension (and probably unavoidable tension) as some game sites (I'd argue many game sites) are in the process of transiting from a primary product-driven game review to one that is more akin to the experiential reviews common in the film industry.

Whether or not you like that type of review is, of course, your choice.  There are (and will still be I imagine) outlets that put out that kind of review.

Anyway, it's interesting to think about.  Partly it's interesting because I think when a lot of people say they want "objective reviews" it's not because they think reviews can be truly objective, it's because they don't have the vocabulary to really express what they want, and so fall back onto "objective".

What they really want is a product focused review of the game, as it pertains to the functioning of that product according to developer promises.

I think there's room in the world for both, but I also think that the best way to have both is to not get mad at outlets that try for a more film-esque experiential review.   

If you don't like a review, move on, and read a different one.

(And before an argument is made that Metacritic should separate out different "types" of reviews, it should be noted that neither Metacritic nor Rotten Tomatoes separate out different types of movie reviews from the major pubs) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's also important to note that many games press outlets differ site to site for how they see ethics and where/what ethical behavior is. Some sites disclose in every review how the game was obtained, some note.  Some sites take free travel because they think it's fine, some don't.

Trying to paint a broad brush that "all" gaming sites must follow these rules as some kind of unbreakable law is silly and totally ignorant of the way any journalism industry works.

(You can make the same arguement for film sites, for car sites, hell, even for general news sites) </TEXT>

I still think that when a person acts, it's overly simplistic to blame it on any thing -- it's typically an entire spectrum of stimuli, environmental and mental pressures that causes someone to do something.

One correction:

 The calls for bullying from game journalists listed above have been most unacceptable and immature indeed... But what do they have to do with Anil? 

Sam Biddle and Erin Ryan are journlists, but not *game journalists*.  Valleywag is a site dedicated to rumors and other similar news for Silicon Valley and tech companies.

Jezebel labels itself as "celebrity, sex and fashion for women."

GamerGate has literally been spending the last two days putting themselves into a frenzy because two non-gaming journalists said something they didn't like (admittedly, Biddle's tweet was kinda stupid).

A movement for ethics in games journalism, indeed. </TEXT>

That time commitment context really helps me judge what someone with 40 hours in a game says vs someone with 4 hours into a game says vs what someone with 180 hours in a game says.

It's not simply a matter of more hours = more trustworthy, as due to self-selection, players with more hours will like the game more.  It's more information that lets me frame the written review properly in my head. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Polygon describes their scores this way:

 Sevens are good games that may even have some great parts, but they also have some big "buts." They often don't do much with their concepts, or they have interesting concepts but don't do much with their mechanics. They can be recommended with several caveats.

 Eights are great games, and easily recommendable with caveats in mind. They're examples of consistently sound design, or a novel concept well-developed around a functional core. A game that executes well enough to be remembered, even if there are better contemporaries.

Personally, I think the text of the review makes it clear that while Arthur had a big problem with the sexualization, he also enjoyed the rest of the game.

Hence a 7.5 that falls between those two quoted descriptions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This self post brought you by finally getting 100 relic iron.  And the self loathing that comes from looking at the clock, realizing it is 1am on a Sunday, and that at least part of your Saturday night was spent repeatedly running into dark rooms that are usually empty.

I hate doing chest runs.  I'm not entirely sure why it bothers me so much.  But it does.  It feels like it takes the accepted grinding of Destiny to a whole new level.

EDIT: I KNOW WHY.  THIS IS WHY

 My problem is that chest runs are one of the only "grinds" in Destiny that do not organically follow from Bungie's prized 30 second combat loop.

 In fact, combat is almost antithetical to chest runs, because it wastes time between opening more chests.

 If enemies would occasional drop materials relevant to the locale, then materials gathering would actually feel like it's part of the game, an organic consequence of combat.

ORIGINAL:

But the worst part?

If you dedicate 6 hours to gathering materials, you dont' have to do more chest runs for weeks and weeks. 

That's stupid.  Why is it even in the game, at that point?  It's not even a useful grind, or a required grind.  It's just a stupid, inconsequential, easy to surpass gateway that requires me to dedicate time that could been spent on other more useful, more challenger, and more demanding grinds.

I hate you, chest runs. I hate you so much.

EDIT: more than loot changes, more than nerfing auto rifles, more than letting me shoot weapons in the Tower so I can finally pump some shotgun shells into the Cryptarch's face, I wish **enemies would occasionally drop materials**.  That's all I ask.  

Make material collection a natural extension of that vaunted 30 second loop.  </TEXT>

I didn't understand him as a character.  I didn't get his motivations, or how he kept his internal moral compass consistent.  And as a result, the narrative never really grabbed me.  

I finished the game, but only out of a sense of duty to finish something that I started.

Granted, some of the gameplay mechanics had promise. And there was some quite timely depictions of a surveillance state, and what that means for the public.  Unfortunately, none of that ever gets explored all that deeply. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Note: I'm around level 150 Paragon on console, and around 300 Paragon on PC.

Some classes are just outright better feeling with the console controller: Demon Hunter, Crusader, Monk, Barbarian.  There's  just a special kind of physicality being in direct control of a character gives you.

Target/AOE spell casting fare a little worse.  Abilities that you that you used to be able to pinpoint target on the PC (ie, with most Wizard AOE abilities, Crusader targeted abilities) are now autotargeted on an enemy.  

That isn't super important most of the time, but can get annoying when it autolocks on the wrong monster, or when you can't tactically position a spell in a specific location.

FWIW, even with minor drawbacks in targeted spells, I still find it hard to go back to PC mouse based movement and attacking.  That method of controlling just feels so distant now.  Making me feel like I'm controlling a robot drone rather than a character that's supposed to be me.

Other than controls, there are certain UI enhancements made to the console version that I wish carried over to the PC.  The console version gives you a nice red/green arrow based instant compare between items, and also the ability to mark items as junk means you can sell or salvage all of your junk at once.  

The console also gets rid of inventory management -- now items just auto add themselves to categories in your inventory.  Same with your stash.  Gems, weapons, etc all get autosorted into stash categories. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The "harm no one" line has been repeated in a lot of arguments I hear, and it's one that I think is facetious at best, and willfully ignorant at worst of how much a racist view of the world plays into other actions in one's life.

If Sterling holds these thoughts in private, then what is he thinking when dealing with minorities daily in his role as owner of an NBA team?  How does it inform his decisions?

His literal words were spoken in private and harmed no one.  The racist demeanor revealed by his words indicate a long history of subtle, but real harm. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There wasn't really a cogent point.  Sterling was fired for the impact his remarks had on the NBA, the NBA's fans, players, and sponsors.  His racism, however personal, however private, casts a *very* long shadow when he's the owner of a team in a professional sports league with a sizable African American player base.

His free speech rights were, also, not violated at any point.

I give Josh the benefit of the doubt for his original reasons for tweeting his position (that media sensationalism can many times do more harm than good), but this specific case is a dumb example to make the point.

<TEXT> FWIW, we did look at Snap.  But Snap itself doesn't help you create the line art in any way, and the things it does do -- let you easily create SVG objects and group/animate them -- was way overkill for the two specific properties we wanted to change.

Ultimately, in this case, Snap would have been a superfluous 70kb of minimized JavaScript.  

Snap would not have:

1. Made SVG creation easier in this case.  In fact, it would have taken longer due to the line art.

2. Made SVG manipulation any easier -- all of our effects were applied wholesale to any path elements inside the SVG.  

It *would* have:

1. Helped animate the two properties we wanted to animate.

A short 15 line JavaScript snippet would also have done the same thing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Source: http://www.dota2.com/threespirits

The specifics from the patch notes:

- Anyone in a matchmaking party can specify that they'd like to coach the party instead of play. In lobbies, players can choose to coach a team instead of play or spectate. Coaches cannot be used in Team Matchmaking, or Tournament lobbies.

- Increased maximum matchmaking party size to 6, to allow a coach to teach an entire team of students (but you can't Find Match if you have 6 players with no coach)

- Coaches are able to use in-player perspective views and broadcaster tools like line drawing to teach their students. They are able to ping on the ground, the minimap, and anywhere in the HUD itself.

- Coaches are considered to be on the same team as their students, so they cannot see anything in the game that their students can't see.

- Coaches and students have private voice and text communication channels.

- Coaches can hit their 'Hero Select' key to cycle through their students.

- Coaches see spectator-style item purchase popups for their students.

- In-perspective player view now shows the correct state of more HUD elements (Shop Quickbuy, KDA/Last Hits/Denies, Buyback). These improvements apply the the in-perspective view in live games and replays, as well as coaches.

http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1rqsrc6

 Dear Destructoid readers and friends,

 Destructoid and Jim Sterling part ways today. Jim has been an important part of Destructoid since our earliest days, so I'm sad to see him go. Really sad. Totally bummed. 

 Change is the only constant in our strange little internet world, as you know. It turned out that where Destructoid and Jim were moving toward didn't line up anymore. So Jim and I have come to a mutual agreement this week: for us to continue on our paths, we'll have to do so separately. 

 I like to imagine that we are friends that have fought in the same trenches in wars these past five or so years. But now Jim is moving to a fight on a new front in the war. Though we're no longer in the same company, we can both continue pushing forward, knowing that the other is out there fighting the good fight. 

 And just like any good soldier, I will always have Jim's back. 

 And you never know where the war will take us -- I'm sure we'll be fighting alongside each other someday. 

 Jim, thanks so much for everything.  </TEXT>

 If you post a picture or some artistic work you made some-where without any notification of the author or copyright notice, it's effectively public domain.

This hasn't been true since 1989, when the U.S joined the Berne Convention, and no longer required copyright notices for photos to be considered under copyright. http://photosecrets.com/copyright-notice

The UK, which is where Richard Lewis lives and where the publication originates is also a member and adherent of the convention.

<TEXT> Clicks haven't been the primary metric that ads use for a long time now.  Most of the ads you see -- video prerools, Google ad words, ads on NY Times, etc etc are all based around impressions.

So yes, blocking views of the ad directly impacts the metrics they use to sell more ads to advertisers. </TEXT>

Such things have happened in the past to Reddit moderators, to devs, to many other people.

The vast majority of online threats are nothing more than an angry person on the other end venting. But then every so often, you get someone who posts or collects information that could very well impact your offline life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> strange, i'm the opposite: graces really grated on me, and i had to push myself to finish.  the cities weren't interesting, the characters for the most part were boring and/or fairly standard for the genre.  

i did like the new fighting gameplay though.

i'm about 6 hours into Xillia, and so far it's been miles ahead of Graces for me.  You don't have the *really* sluggish childhood arc in Graces to go through, the characters are immediately fascinating, and Maxwell dealing with being a normal human is a more interesting conceit to me than Sophie. </TEXT>

<TITLE> If you bought a non-refundable airline ticket for IPL6, these links might help you. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-03-05 02:57:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've had to cancel tickets in the past, and sometimes its not a lost cause.   Here are some links to several airlines that might help any of you who bought tickets out.

*Note: this is for domestic flights.  Unfortunately, I don't have much experience with international flight cancellations.*

**FIRST**: If you purchased your ticket within the past 24 hours, you can request a refund on any airline due to government regulations: [link](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-10-23/travel/sc-trav-1023-travel-mechanic-20121023_1_american-airlines-refund-full-fare)

*Note: most of these are not true refunds. They are mostly just ticket credits you can use for another flight within a certain time period.*

**Delta**

[Refund FAQ](http://www.delta.com/content/www/en_US/support/faqs/preparing-for-your-trip/refunds-faqs.html): 

 Even if your ticket is not refundable, you might still be able to cancel your itinerary. You have one year from the ticket's original issue date to reschedule your travel without losing the full value of the ticket (less any applicable change fees).

[Itinerary Cancel Link](https://www.delta.com/mytrips/)


**American**

I've had mixed success with their refund process.  Sometimes I get a large portion back as a credit towards a future flight, sometimes they just say GTFO and I'm outta lukc.

Language:

 Subject to certain restrictions and fees defined in the rules of the fare, the value of a wholly unused nonrefundable ticket may only be used toward the purchase of a new nonrefundable ticket. Travel on such reissued tickets (or subsequently reissued tickets) must commence no later than one year from the date of issue of the original ticket. The value of an AA nonrefundable fare can only be applied to the value of another AA nonrefundable fare. The value of an AA non-refundable fare cannot be applied to the purchase of another airline refundable/nonrefundable fare.

Link: [refund request](https://prefunds.aa.com/refunds/)

**United**

Unfortunatley, I've had zero luck with United over the years. But it doesn't hurt to try: [refund link](http://www.united.com/web/en-us/content/reservations/refunds/refund.aspx).

**Virgin America**

IIRC, Virgin charges a $100 fee.  Which is better than nothing, I suppose.

 Nonrefundable fares must be cancelled prior to scheduled departure time. In the event a non-refundable ticket is cancelled prior to flight departure, the guest will receive a credit file in the value of the refund minus any change fee. This electronic credit may be used to book travel on Virgin America within 12 months from the cancellation date of the original itinerary.

No link for Virgin --  you need to login to your itinerary and there should be a link.

**AirTran**

The one or two times I tried with them, I had to call them directly at  866-5-REFUND.  They charged a cancellation fee, but I did get back at least a portion of my original ticket cost.

**SouthWest**

Never personally cancelled on them, but I've heard of mixed successes from friends.  Though all of them were minus a cancellation fee (sometimes substantial).  [refund link](http://www.southwest.com/flight/cancel-air-reservation.html) </TEXT>

<DATE> 2011-04-05 13:22:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> *tl;dr: We are all immensely proud of SCReddit's success. Several days ago, I sat down with FearGorm and talked to him about the origins and people involved in that great endeavor.  We also talked about his team's history and goals with their new project, WellPlayed. This is their story.*

*in service of full disclosure, I will be writing several articles for WellPlayed in the coming weeks and months. FearGorm and his team were impressed enough with my previous posts to offer me the privilege of writing for their new site.*

*This article is also posted at [http://wellplayed.org](http://wellplayed.org), but I wrote this piece with /r/starcraft in my mind, and with this community as the intended audience.  The team below has done great things for /r/starcraft, and I felt it was important that their tale is not forgotten.*

**For Us, The Living**

In the late, hot days of Summer 2010, shortly after Starcraft II's long climb out of beta, /r/starcraft was a community that was missing something. Not members, or content, but community events they could gather around. The subreddit talked about the beta, about Team Liquid, about HD and Husky and others.

What this subreddit didn't talk about, because we couldn't, was our own members regularly competing in our own events for the enjoyment of our own community.

Then FearGorm started the [SCReddit Open](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/cvw53/introducing_screddit_open_a_weekly_tournament_for/).

And just like that, the many talented players of /r/starcraft had a home.  

As regularly as possible, we gathered, and we played.  We cheered our first winner, and every subsequent winner, as [champions of our own](http://screddit.com/open/hall-of-fame/).   Great games were played, with upsets and streaks, complaints of imbalance and teary eyed wails of QQ.   We watched chompyyy, and WinHouse, and NrGdde, and all the rest.

We laughed, we cried, and all we got out of it, at least initially, was simple prestige.  Not prestige with anyone outside /r/starcraft, but bragging rights within.  

The team that assembled behind FearGorm grew stronger with each passing SCReddit Open.  First came live streams, then higher quality justin.tv streams.  Then prizes and small amounts of money.  Each Open was stronger than the last, and /r/starcraft grew to know not only the players, but the casters.

But that wasnt enough.  SCReddit Open was known mostly within the halls of /r/starcraft.  FearGorm, and others, wanted a bigger event.  Something to put SCReddit on the map.

**Glory Road**

There was a brief but strong moment of incredulity during the GSL World Championships when White-Ras [info card flashed on the screen](http://i.imgur.com/luToT.png) and it proudly stated that he was the SCReddit Invitational Championship.

Surprised though we were, looking back, the SCReddit Invitational was equal in quality to any other Starcraft II tournament.  It was produced to the highest standards, gathered more views on the stream than anything else until TSL3, and included outstanding players of all nationalities and races.  It was even commentated by Day9, djWHEAT and a whole crew of talented, well-known casters.

It was, in short, ample reason for the SCReddit team, and /r/starcraft, to feel extremely proud.

But the transition from SCReddit Opens to the SCReddit Invitational is seemingly large, an abrupt leap forward in scale, complexity, and sheer production quality.

How did this happen?

As with many things, it started with a group of dedicated people.

**By His Bootstraps**

The initial post that [introduced the SCReddit Invitational](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/elpyb/introducing_the_screddit_invitational_600_prize/) (SCRI) revealed the prize pool.  With help from a very generous and dedicated group of Redditors, over $600 was raised.  But just having sponsors wasnt enough.  A great tournament is derived from a multitude of areas: production, art, organization, brackets, and referees; SCReddit needed help, and it was looking for help from the community that had supported them for so long.

They needed all the untapped talent that we, /r/starcraft, could offer up.  And offer up we did.

SCRI had wonderful referees. Fair and organized, they kept the entire event running smoothly without any major hiccups.  They ensured that matches were set up correctly, that players were where they were supposed to be.  They were the arbiters, and they took their roles seriously.

SCRI had incredible production values.  Their VODs were some of the best ever seen. The hype videos, the website, the sheer professionalism of the entire tournament rivaled that of any other.  Every aspect rang with quality.

SCRI had awesome players.  SCRI truly succeeded in its goal of drawing great players to a tournament supported by the Reddit community.  Players who were famous through the scene, and who could bring to bear their massive talents to produce games that every fan would enjoy: KiwiKaki, White-Ra, TT1, and more.

*Its All Still There.* 

Check it out if you havent seen it at: [http://screddit.com/invitational/](http://screddit.com/invitational/)

**Time Enough for Love**

Some time before the SCRI, the SCReddit team discovered that they really wanted a good, robust tournament management system to make their lives easier.  Running a tournamnt was hard work and immensely time consuming.  Anything to make the process more streamlined and manageable would greatly reduce overhead.

So just as theyve done before and since, [they put out a plea for help](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/ekuba/want_to_make_a_tournament_management_system_for/).

And just as weve done before and since, we answered.  Developers and designers from across the world put in their time and effort into creating a system for running events.

Somewhere along the line, a name was decided: WellPlayed.  

And somewhere along alone the line, dreams grew bigger, goals more ambitious, and the desire to truly create a space for SC2 more determined than ever.

**Citizen of the Galaxy**

Much of the team that created and produced the SCRI still remains to this day, working tirelessly to promote esports and to create quality content.

Shortly after the SCRI, they were contacted by some of the biggest names in the scene.

At PAX East, this team  now going by the moniker WellPlayed  was tagged to help produce Day9s and Huskys VODs. Working in tandem with the two popular casters, WellPlayed cut and edited videos that really highlighted that talents of Day9 and Husky, and provided the community with yet another round of good, high-quality Starcraft II content.

WellPlayed, previously SCReddit, proved once again that they were eminently capable of producing great content for fans.

Unknown to us, their performance at PAX East was but a precursor to grander dreams still to come.

**Time For the Stars**

WellPlayed wanted more.  Not only out of themselves, but also out of the community at large.  They wanted better ways of consuming streams, easier ways of following tournaments, and less time-consuming methods of managing events.

They wanted, in short, a custom-created hub for all things Starcraft II.  A hub that acted as a nexus for the entire scene, that gathered fans, and players, and streams in one place for discussion, for consumption, for organizing.

Never known to back down from a challenge, the WellPlayed team built exactly that.

With the core group of developers, artists, producers, writers and marketers that helped create the SCRI, and with additional help from even more members of /r/starcraft from around the world, WellPlayed slowly crawled itself towards reality.

And now, after countless hours of blood, sweat and tears, WellPlayed is ready to show the world their newest project.

**Beyond This Horizon**

FearGorm was careful to note that the site wasnt built because the WellPlayed team was dissatisfied with the community at /r/starcraft, at Team Liquid, or anywhere else.  The team was well aware of the effect that the subreddit and Team Liquid has in drawing and motivating the legions of fans.

They were aware that they were standing on the shoulders of giants.  Aware that they were working within an environment created by very dedicated and passionate people that came before.

What the WellPlayed team was dissatisfied with, however, was the platform.

They felt that though both /r/starcraft and Team Liquid had great communities, the platform on which they resided wasnt something that was specifically made, custom tailored to their needs.  Just as they wanted to give the /r/starcraft community a tournament they could call their own with the SCReddit Opens and SCRI, now they want to give the community a home to call their own.  

A home designed not to divide the community, but to bring it together so that new members, new players and new fans could more easily discover just what it is that we love and devote some much of our time and energy towards.

eSports.  Starcraft II.

**To Sail Beyond the Sunset**

And so, after talking with FearGorm and learning what the WellPlayed team has planned, I sayI hope we all sayto them:

**gl. hf.**

And for what theyve done with SCReddit for the /r/starcraft communty:

<TEXT> *GSL Championship Team Game Spoilers*

*tl;dr: White-Ra is a hero. And has been a hero. Since forever.  And watch his upcoming games in NASL and TSL3.  White-Ra will be facing MC again in TSL Ro16.*

**Stemming the Tide**

After day one of the GSL World Championship team game, the Korean team was behind the World team, and things were in danger of spiraling out of control. TT1 carried back to back wins against HoSeo.San and oGsNaDa, and entered the GOM studios high on his victories.

oGsMC and Team Korea had seen enough.

The current best Starcraft II player in the world, oGsMC was Team Korea's best chance to regain momentum and shift the winds in their favor.  As he proved in his GSL Team League 2 performance against team SlayerS, MC was an opponent capable of taking multiple consecutive victories against a variety of players and races.

After a brief PvP battle, TT1 fell. A small win by itself, but large in significance. 

Team Korea had made its stand.

As Artosis talked with his World team, and Tasteless stood ready to commentate on the next game, who would go out to face oGsMC?

Who would, in turn, make a stand for the World?

As it turns out, Artosis knew exactly who to send.

**Rage Against the Machine**

In 2006, on the main stage of the WCG Grand Final in Italy, White-Ra was preparing to face one of the toughest opponents of the event.

A Korean player by the name of iloveoov.

Nicknamed the Monster Terran and the Machine Terran, iloveoov was a few years past his era of absolute dominance, and the the air of invincibility that resulted in his miraculous 34-9 win/loss ratio in 2003.  But he was still extremely potent, and not someone to be taken lightly.

Using effective drop harassment with Reavers, White-Ra managed to deal significant economic damage to iloveoov.  Unfortunately, iloveoov's macro proved to be too resilient, and in both games, the Machine Terran engaged in a slow but steady march towards White-Ra's bases.  Despite dark templar harassment and more Reaver drops, iloveoo's inevitable advance could not be stopped.

Ultimately, White-Ra would gg in a 0-2 loss. 

But the strands of fate are woven strangely, and this would not be the only chance White-Ra would have against a top Korean player.

Popular around the world, the WCG match was broadcasted internationally, and casted in multiple languages in multiple streams.

Who casted for the English stream?

[None other than Tasteless.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElkVcQJ7PMQ)

He, too, would have another chance to see White-Ra face a top Korean player.

**A Game of Thrones**

It was 2009. The IEF group stage. White-Ra was set to face a Korean Brood War legend: Boxer.

Utilizing similar tactics he employed against iloveoov at the WCG Grand Final, White-Ra drop harassed with Reavers and Dark Templars to absolutely demolish Boxer's economy.  Simultaneous to this harassment, White-Ra started multi-pronged attacks that forced the Terran to defend on multiple fronts.  

Eventually, it proved too much.  Dragoons at the front and harassing Reavers at the back pushed Boxer's forces into a pincer. 

In front of a large Korean audience, in a live televised match, White-Ra defeated the Terran Emperor.

Who else was watching, and cheering, at the back of the crowd?

[Artosis.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8NLWHE8UW0#t=242s)

He, too, would have another chance to see White-Ra battle against a top Korean player.

**You Shall Not Pass**

At over 30 years of age, White-Ra is one of the oldest active professional players of Starcraft II.  But with age comes wisdom, and poise under pressure.  

Artosis and Team World decide to send White-Ra, counting on his experience in live televised games against Korean players to bring out his best abilities.

Protoss versus Protoss in Starcraft II is a volatile match up.  There's not often any chance for finesse or elegance, with brute force clashes between two similarly composed armies happening with fair frequency.

But White-Ra wouldn't have any of that.

With Tasteless and Artosis looking on in wonder, and perhaps flashing privately to those games they watched White-Ra play so many years ago, the Ukrainian Protoss engaged once again in drop harass.

Flying warp prisms instead of shuttles, White-Ra repeatedly warped in units inside oGsMC's mineral line.  Harassing zealots caused massive economic damage, and despite MC's best efforts in meticulous Stalker blink micro, the Kratos Protoss was fighting a losing battle on two sides.

A Brood War player of White-Ra's calibre, however, is not just about harassment.  Showing the world some of the best Protoss vs Protoss micro thus far in Starcraft II, White-Ra engaged in a calculated push towards MC.  With White-Ra's continued Zealot drops and constant pressure at the front, MC was steadily losing ground.

In the end, just as he almost accomplished against iloveoov, and just as he did accomplish against Boxer, White-Ra's economic harass put MC into a deep enough hole that defeat was inevitable.

gg. oGsMC was defeated. 

The deadliest player Team Korea had to send was limited to a single win.  

The World answered Korea's stand with a stand of their own.

As White-Ra made his victory lap, Tasteless and Artosis may have stood back, reminisced, and thought: "Yeah, I've seen that before."

Well played, White-Ra. 

*What's next for White-Ra? Among other tournaments, White-Ra will be in NASL and TSL3.*

**Don't miss White-Ra's upcoming Round of 16 match against MC in TSL3. A rematch I can't wait to see.** </TEXT>

**Salad Days**

One week way back in the prehistoric days of Starcraft, Blizzard had just about wrapped up its beta testing of Brood War.  Just prior to the retail release of the expansion, Blizzard decided to conduct its very own King of the Beta tournament to determine just who was the best Starcraft player at the time.  Many competed, and in the end, MIT computer science student Zileas, a Protoss, proved to be the champion.

*Zileas was a Westerner.*

The Protoss MIT student's reign was soon eclipsed by one of the more dominant players of the time, Maynard.  The name will probably sound familiar to you. Maynard was one of the first to engage in what is now one of the most common sights in professional Starcraft: the worker transfer.  Whenever you hear someone say that they are "maynarding", remember Miguel "Maynard" Bombach.

*Maynard was a Westerner.*

All good things, however, must be followed by an even brighter thing. Maynard's rule was not eternal, and soon a player named Grrr.... would take center stage.  A Protoss player, Grrr.... was perhaps Starcraft's first true era.  No one could touch him. At the turn of the millennium, Grrr.... set his sights on Korea.  He landed shortly in the burgeoning months of 2000, and proceeded to rampage his way through any and all that Korea had to offer. He won the very first OSL, and being dominant in the earliest days of Korea's televised Starcraft scene, became a veritable celebrity.

*Grrr.... was a Westerner.*

But then, a shift. A disturbance in the Force.

**The Emperor's Empire**

The BoxeR that crashed into the Korean Starcraft scene was not the struggling, elder statesmen that most know from today's GSL. This BoxeR, this Terran Emperor, was at the peak and prime of his playing abilities.  With the rise of BoxeR, Grrr.... would never match the successes of his former days.

But dominance was not the sole domain of BoxeR.  As with all things, another challenger eventually rose up to contest the existing champion. In this case, it was iloveoov.

And after iloveoov, there came NaDa, and July, and Saviour and Bisu and Flash and Jaedong.  

There did not come, however, a Westerner.  

**The New Capital**

With the fall of Grr...., no other Westerner was a dominating force over the entire Starcraft scene for an extended period of time.  The capital of the esport, the heart and soul and largest concentration of the most skilled players in the world lay squarely in South Korea.

And so it has stayed that way, from 2002 all the way to the current Brood War scene.

**Wings of Liberty**

But that's Brood War.  What about SC2? It's a different game, with different units and different balances.  Does Korea continue to maintain a stranglehold on the most elite of the elite?

Yes.  

But perhaps not for long.

One of the biggest contributing factors to Korea's dominance in Brood War has been the country's extremely competitive scene.  Sponsors carried a multitude of teams that trained dozens of talented players.  These players lived together in team houses and trained for countless hours in countless matches against against countless opponents. It was an environment that rewarded hard work with glory, fame, and a relative degree of wealth.

With the announcement of the NASL, the continuing tournaments of MLG, and the amazing groups of players gathered in Europe for Assembly and Dreamhack, the international scene is starting to resemble in sheer number and opportunity, the tournament scene of Brood War's South Korea.

Serious money is on the line; in fact, more money is being given out now in SC2 than in any other period in Brood War.  

Hard work is and will be rewarded with glory, fame, and a pretty fat honking wad of money.  A bonjwa, a player who dominates for an entire era, could very well see earnings of more than $300,000 in tournaments alone in less than than a full year.  GSL, MLG, NASL, Assembly, Dreamhack, TSL. Even the rumored IGN Starleague.

It's what some would call a target rich environment.

**If You Can't Beat Them...**

Many Western teams have started to adopt what were previously predominantly Korean methods of training.  Team Liquid players in the GSL live in the same house and train together every day.  Recently, TT1, Fenix, Catz and Drewbie announced that they were forming a pro house.  

The opportunities of non-Korean tournaments is fostering the same kind of environment that Brood War did for Korea.  

Improvement must be rapid, or some other player will improve more rapidly and steal that cash prize.

**Here, There Be Dragons**

But it won't be an easy road.  The nature of many international tournaments are that they accept any and all who would wish to test their skills.  This includes the current crop of top Korean Starcraft players.  

MVP, Nestea, MC, NaDa have all participated or will participate in a variety of Western tournaments like TSL or Dreamhack.  They will not be easy opponents, and the Korean players remain a sizable threat to any players looking at first prize.

**Korea vs the World**

In many ways then, the upcoming matches will be one of the first true tests of Western vs Korean skill.  Players are in the studio. Games are played in the same region.  Lag is minimized.  All factors not involving player skill is normalized out of the equation.

The Koreans have chosen their elite eight: 

*IMNestea*. Zerg. GSL Champion. Considered one of the safest and most consistent players in the world.

*IMMvp*. Terran. GSL Champion. Nicknamed by Artosis the Game Genie Terran.  Considered nigh invincible in TvT.

*MarinKingPrime*.  Terran. Two time GSL finalist. Ushered in a huge metagame shift that involved fast, tempo based play with a highly mobile bio based army.  

*oGsNaDa*. Terran. Nicknamed the Genius Terran in Brood War, NaDa is still ranked as amongst the most successful Brood War players of all time.

*oGsMC*. Protoss. Two time GSL Champion. Completely decimated both his opponents in both GSL finals.  Confident. Arrogant. And with the skills to back it up.

*ST_July*. Zerg. GSL finalist. Nicknamed the God of War, he was one of the few Brood War players to snatch championships in multiple distinct eras. Has a unique play style unlike any other Zerg in the world.

*anyproPrime*. Protoss. Probably considered amongst the weakest of the lineup of 8, he's still formidable in all matchups.

*sanZenith*. Protoss. The Cinderella story of GSL March. Knocked out both Nestea and Boxer in the round of 32. 

**The World vs Korea**

The world is jostling at a chance to fight against the Koreans.  Qualifying torments have been going in all major gaming regions on the planet. Winners from those qualifiers are flying from North America, Europe, and even non-Korea Asian countries.

Representing the World in this event:

*MoonGlade*. Zerg. Australia. Seeded GSL Code A. 4th at IEM. 

*MorroW*. Zerg. Sweden. Placed 1st at IEM Cologne in a victory over Idra. Known for mid-game macro.

*Sen*. Zerg. Taiwan. Arguably Taiwan's top player in both Brood War and SC2. Appearances at MLG Dallas and GSL3. Watch his NASL application video for great hilarity: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICPy7kVu0cI  

*Dimaga*. Zerg. Ukraine. Participated at IEM Cologne. Had some controversy in TSL2 that resulted in a ban from TSL3.

*Jinro*. Terrran. Sweden. Nicknamed by Koreans as the Gorilla Terran. Known for strong macro, only Westerner to make it to round of 4 twice in the GSL.  Some say he's the best Western Terran player in the world at the moment. GSL Code S.

*HuK*. Protoss. Canada. GSL Code S. Famous for his "that's halo" comment at MLG DC in a game against SelecT. Good unit control, and interesting strategies when he's at his best.

*TT1*. Protoss. Canada. MLG Dallas 2nd place after a loss to Jinro. 

*White-Ra*. Protoss. Ukraine. 3rd place at Blizzcon 2010. One of the oldest of the World players, but has a long history of Starcraft experience. 

Who will win? 

Will the era of Western domination that ended with Grrr.... ever reappear? 

No ones knows for sure, but one thing is certain.

**The games next week will be a taste of things to come.  It will be the first battle in a war for Starcraft II supremacy.**

<TITLE> Sit down, my friends, and let me tell you the story of GSL Team League 2 (spoilers) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-03-24 17:11:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **tl;dr: just read the freaking thing.** Every sc2 esports fan needs to know.  It will become part of SC2 lore.

**NOTE: Do yourself a favor and watch the games.**

**Two Roads Converge**

OUR STORY UNFOLDS with two paths, one begun in the summer days of Brood War, and the other in these early days of Starcraft 2.

Slayers_Boxer, given the opportunity to create a team in Brood War, surrounds himself with a hand picked crowd of then unknown players.  Most of them do well, but one -- iloveoov -- quickly stands out from the rest.  Surpassing even his mentor, iloveoov becomes the first true *bonjwa*. The team that Boxer formed around him would become SKT, truly the greatest Brood War team there ever was.

In another time, and another place, CellaWerra of the Werra clan is playing Starcraft 2.  He makes friends and gains many fans in the foreign audience.  Known for his humor and his on-stream antics, he quickly makes a name for himself outside Korea with videos such as the [13 Gate build](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJFG8jtU0CM).

Two things happen.  

Slayers_Boxer decides to leave Brood War and start a career in SC2 with the GSL.  He makes his debut in GSL season 2, eventually beating NaDa to advance to the Round of 4. Now deep in the SC2 scene, Boxer needs a team.  Intel answers his call, and sponsors not only a team, but also Boxer himself.  

Meanwhile, the clan Werra is disbanded admist a firestorm of controversy as their coach is accused of sexual misconduct towards Werra members.  And just like that, CellaWerra is just Cella, and needs a team.

Soon, Boxer puts out an open call for the new team he is creating with Intel's support, named Slayers.  Cella applies, and is in.  He becomes Slayers_Cella.  And as Slayers_Cella, he still continues to amuse and entertain his foreign fans, including [a certain rendition of a certain song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEP05i6plr8).

**First One's Just Practice**

The members that Boxer gathers around himself this time around in the new Slayers team are composed, just like SKT, of relative unknowns. None of the star power or fame that a Nestea or MC possesses.

In February, GSL announces that it will be televising a one week team league.  It features the top 8 teams in SC2 at that time in Korea: oGs, StarTale, Incredible Miracle (IM), Team SCV Life (TSL), For Our Utopia (fOu), ZeNex, Prime, and Slayers.

In an exciting series over a week (that you really should watch), IM manages to take the championship, on the strength of IMNestea, IMSeed and IMMvP.

Slayers, meanwhile, falls in the first round to ZeNex.  Boxer himself came out as first pick for Slayers, and falls in the first game to ZeNex, one of the weaker teams. 

But one player on Slayers stood out in that series: Slayers_ Jjob.  In an almost reverse all kill, he went last in the Slayers lineup against ZeNex, and took out 3 of ZeNex's players.  

**An Emperor Falters**

With a team around him and sponsors to support him, Boxer seems primed to focus on advancing in Code S.  Unfortunately, in the March Code S season, he falls in the first round of 32 to SanZenith and Ensnare. In the following Up and Down matches, Boxer loses again.  

Boxer, the Emperor himself, is in Code A.

At the same moment that Boxer falls to Code A, however, another Slayers player -- Slayers_Alicia -- plays an extraordinary series against IMMvP, advancing to Code S while simultaneously helping to knock MvP down to Code A. This would not be the last time viewers would see Alicia.

**This Time for Serious -- or, GSL Team League 2**

GSL Team League 2 started with the same 8 team lineup.  Of the 8 teams, the general ranking was:

Top Tier: oGs, IM, TSL, ST
Lower Tier: Prime, ZeNex, fOu, Slayers

Most people put Slayers below even the lower tier, given their past performance in the team league and the obscurity of their players.

Viewers were introduced for the first time to the new vice-coach of team Slayers: Slayers_Cella.  Carrying a notebook and constantly talking to his team members, Cella was perhaps the person that Slayers needed the most.  A coach who could focus on strategy, not just at the player level, but at the team level.  Someone who could see the flow of the team vs team battles, and make calls about who to send out.

Slayers's first opponent was oGs.  Home to NaDa, TOP and 2 time GSL Champion MC, oGs were heavy favorites to win the team league.  MC appeared to be unstoppable, and NaDa and TOP rounded out a bevy of top tier players.

**The Birth of a Legend Killer**

oGs vs Slayers starts off with matches between Min, InCa and TOP that leaves the score at 1-1. In response, Slayers sends out Ryung.  In a series of 2 games, Ryung demonstrates a masterful understanding of TvT. At every step of each game, he was composed, calm, and knew exactly what to do and when to do it.

Down 3-1, oGs had nowhere to go. What could they do but send out oGsMC?

Hot off the highs of winning an unprecedented second GSL Code S championship, oGsMC was considered by most to be the single best SC2 player in the world at that point.  

And he proves it, by defeating Ryung and Frozen.  

The score is now 3-3. Cella gathers his notes. 

Slayers sends out **Slayers_MMA**.  

Who the hell is Slayers_MMA?  Slayers_MMA is the new name of Slayers_Jjob, the player who nearly reverse all-killed ZeNex in the prior team league.

In a furious game of micro timings, MMA managed to defeat MC and create one of the great upsets of the season. 

Slayers, considered the worst team of the previous team league, advances over oGs.

**Entering the Octagon**

Next up for Slayers is team StarTale. Trying to prove himself, Frozen opens up for Slayers.  In a surprise move, StarTale decides to lead with JulyZerg.

Frozen fared no better against July than he did against MC the previous day.  Down 0-1, who could Slayers send out against July, the Code S finalist?

**Slayers_MMA**.

In a quick game, MMA decisively defeats July. And every single StarTale player until STBomber.  In an amazing comeback play, STBomber bridges a huge deficit to defeat MMA. The score was now 3-1, Slayres lead.

One more win for Slayers would end the series.  And it happens. The TvT master Slayers_Ryung steps out once again, and defeats STBomber for the win.

*Slayers is now in the finals.*

**Perchance to Dream**

Team Incredible Miracle, with no less than two GSL champions in their roster, is widely considered to be the most consistent top tier team in Starcraft 2.  

The finals is a best of 9.  First team to five wins seals the deal.

Leading the charge for Slayers was Alicia.  Not having been used at all during the second team league, he makes his debut with an astounding 3-0 run against IM with convincing wins.

Down, IM decides that they should take advantage of PvP and sends out YongHwa.  In a quick back and forth, YongHwa takes the game from Alicia, making the score 3-1.

Comfortably ahead, Slayers decides to send out Slayers_Golden.  Golden, formerly of fOu, is unable to surpass YongHwa.  The score is now 3-2.

Falling once again back to the very solid and consistent Slayers_Ryung, Slayers manages to take a victory over YongHwa with some clutch TvP.  

4-2, Slayers lead.  IM is now against the wall.  With Nestea out, that left only one player they could send.

January GSL champion IMMvp.

** Patch 1.3 and the sweet, sweet sounds of Yamato cannons**

Stepping back a couple hours, Blizzard released Patch 1.3 in Korea just before the finals of the team league.  Patch 1.3 introduced many changes, including a speed buff to Battlecruisers.

Back in the team league finals, Ryung is playing great against IMMvP.  Ryung is sieging at the right moments, expanding at the right timings, and generally avoiding any serious missteps in the complicated chess game that is TvT.

Then MVP breaks all the rules.  **He makes Battlecruisers**.  MVP realizes that with the new speed buff, Battlecruises were once again useful in the TvT endgame.  MVP tears through Ryung's primarily ground and siege tank based army.  With a few clutch Yamato cannon shots at a sizable amount of vikings that Ryung had managed to scrounge up, MVP wins the game.

The score was now 4-3, Slayers lead.

** Pause, Crash, Restart, Pause **

After conferring, Cella and the rest of Slayers decides to send out GanZi next, in an effort to wear down MVP and to gain more information about his playstyle.  

After a series of delays, the game begins only to have GanZi pause and then leave the game.  Drama erupted.  The IM coach could be seen shouting at a GomTV official. 

In the rematch, MVP completely abandons the strategy he was starting to show in the first aborted MVP vs GanZi game, and goes for a quick 5 barracks all marine push.  GanZi is caught flat footed, and loses.

And just like that, the Game Genie Terran equalizes the score.

4-4. Tied.

** Legend vs Legend Killer **

As Slayers has done when facing MC, July, or ZeNex, *out comes Slayers_MMA*.

MMA decides to go for a marine heavy force based on decisive tempo based play.  MVP, meanwhile, decides to play orthodox TvT, getting a fair number of siege tanks and marines. 

The atmosphere is tense.  Nerdchills are experienced. The game to decide it all between the two pillars of each respective team.  

In the end, it comes down to timing.  In a moment so tense that Artosis and Tasteless were reduced to silence as they watched along with the audience, MMA takes advantage of a momentary opening.  He stims and runs.  Tanks explode, and MVP loses his army.

Soon thereafter, it flashes on the screen: **gg**.

MMA wins.

A legend killer. Over the course of a week, Slayers_MMA defeated oGsMC, STJulyZerg and IMMvp.  

Cameras flash.  SlayersBoxer, the Emperor, the founder of SKT, once again holds aloft a championship trophy.

**The Emperor has returned.**

**With minions.**

And Cella?

Cella is now coach of the Korean team for the World Championship games next week. </TEXT>

<TEXT> IMO, **this** is the way that disconnects should be handled: 

http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=202554

Transparency, full disclosure, and simply stating facts + opinons.   And the fact that the casters themselves didn't know about it, and djWheat came out as a neutral voice of authority was very well played.  Gives the entire decision the air of legitimacy and thought.

Since you're casting from replays, you have the luxury and the benefits of fairly judging disconnects. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The GSL had incredible story lines and lore. We should remember them. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-03-17 06:35:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> *Note: I don't pretend to guess what the actual officials of NASL are planning to do.  I'm only speaking toward some opinions voiced by some within the community.*

There have been many who argue that NASL is trying to create compelling story lines, and therefore should limit or eliminate Koreans from participating.  They say that creating an environment for the best possible games to be played is secondary or perhaps even contradictory to having an environment with good story lines.

That way, my friends, leads to madness, disappointment, professional wrestling, and FOX channel reality shows.  Do people really want Kitchen Nightmares US the Starcraft version?

**Let's pause for a moment, and think about the GSL thus far.**

The GSL attempted to gather the greatest players of Starcraft II in the world and put them in a single tournament to find out who is the best.  There was no mercy, no handicaps.  Players won and lost on the strength of their skill alone.

And what kind of drama and what kind of story lines developed?

**Incredible ones**.

If we think back to the GSL, there were no prearranged or produced story lines.  All the story lines emerged naturally.

FruitDealer winning Season 1, coming out of forced suspension due to his family, was epic and moving, but not planned.

Boxer/Foxer/MarineKingPrime and his ascension from a player everyone dismissed as a lame copy to a powerhouse who took out the Season 1 champion, and appeared in two GSL Finals was not dreamed up by a wily producer.

oGsMC's confident personality and style -- and his victory in GSL3 and defeat in GSL4 to someone he steamrolled in GSL3 was not the result of a carefully planned PR campaign.

**And there's more!**

IMMvP's meoteoric rise and fall from Code S champion to Up/Down matches participant.

Slayers_Boxer's heartfelt entrance into Starcraft II and his struggles to retain relevancy in the face of younger players.

LiquidJinro's incredible streak to 2 final four appearances, and his back and forth battles with oGsMC.

SanZenith's cinderella story in his last GSL before his military service.

LiquidHuk's road from Code A to trying to reach Code S, and his failures to qualify for pevious GSL opens.

Three titans of Brood War (July, Nada, Boxer) returning to try and reclaim their former glory.

**There are hundreds more moments in not just GSL, but tournaments and games across the world.**

HuK's "that's halo" moment in MLG.   Idra's "Gracken" nickname.  Select's arduous trek to MLG finals through the loser's bracket.  ActionJesus's relentless sixpools at Dreamhack 2010.  Loner and (at that time) NexGenius's epic back and forth at Blizzcon. Unending tie-breakers and "Korean's pwn white people" at IEM 2011. 

These are all moments that arose organically, naturally, unplanned and uncalled.  They rose out of the spirit of competition.

*All this in less than a year since the official retail release of Starcraft II.*

In the well-meaning eagerness of our community to give NASL wide appeal, let's not forget what makes these moments of lore and story so special in the first place:

**Authenticity**.  ** Spontaneity**.   And perhaps most important, **community driven**.

A Starcraft II e-sports scene with drama and plots crafted by producers is not a community I want to be part of.  

I mean, if I wanted that, I'd just dress up at as a giant Zergling and attend a WWE game.

*In the interest of collecting more story lines and lore that developed through the act of play and practice, I'd love to hear other stories I didn't list in the comments.* </TEXT>

<TITLE> Upvote if you will not buy another season from GOMTV until VLC is restored or GOMPlayer is available for non-Windows. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-03-14 12:18:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **tl;dr**: GOM has now started to actively block VLC and any non GOMPlayer source. This means OS X and Linux users are completely cut off.

Today, in the GSL Season 5 up/down matches of March 14, people using Mac OS X or Linux computers were unable to watch live streams by using VLC.  Due to that, I'm probably not going to buy a pass for season 6. I've paid for passes since the first season of GSL.

**What Happened**

Last week, in the Code A Finals and Code S semi-finals of GSL5, gom started to actively block VLC user agents from working.  Specifically, they stopped serving streams to VLC user agents.  There was a workaround discovered. That worked for a time. 

Then, today, during the Day 1 Up/Down matches, GOM started to exclude everything but the GOMPlayer user agent.  Another workaround was discovered. This worked for around an hour.  Then they appear to have started to block the user agent that GOMPlayer previously used.

There appear to be circumstantial evidence that GOM or someone notifying GOM is monitoring Reddit threads for workarounds to their blocking, and actively preventing new solutions for working for more than a short period of time.

Which this means effectively is that I, or **any other Mac OS X or Linux user**, can no longer watch the HQ stream.

Now, I admit it's within their rights.  They never promised a working stream for any platform not officially supported by GOMPlayer.

Be that as it may, it also means that I won't be purchasing another pass until the issue is resolved. 

They can either restore VLC access or release GOM Player ports to OS X and Windows.  

Until then, GSL, it's been a fun five seasons.  I'll miss ya. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **EDIT 3**:

Looks like GOMTV is possibly watching the Reddit GSL thread and also this thread.  They've now started blocking KPeerClient.  I'm not sure what GOM thinks Mac and Linux users should do.

Not buy anymore season passes, perhaps.

**EDIT 2**:

Looks like in the middle of March 14's live stream, GOMTV once again changed it so that now going directly to the link results in a disconnect.  Sorry guys, still working on trying to figure out a workaround.


**EDIT**: Some people are seeing success by changing VLC's user agent to "KPeerClient".  Changing the user agent isn't working for me, so YMMV.  The method below so far is the only thing I've found that works every time I tried.

For those that can't get VLC working in Mac or Linux, here's a temporary work around:

Save the VLC link to your computer. (Right click link and choose "Save link as".

On mine, the file was named "view.cgi". This is essentially the video stream that VLC would've processed. Your browser may add an extension "view.cgi.crdownload" or "view.cgi.part". Whatever the file name is, use the file that's downloading.

In VLC, open the file.

If you're low on disk space, keep an eye out on the file size of view.cgi. You may need to delete it and redownload occasionally.

**for the technically minded who have some free time**

You can also get this to work on Linux by piping stream output directly to vlc.  in the shell:

    curl "http://yourgomtvstreamlink" | vlc -

"vlc -" tells VLC to read from STDIN.

For Mac OS X users, however, reading from VLC with the OS X version of VLC is unreliable.  In this case, you can try using a named pipe.

In terminal:

    cd ~/Desktop
    mkfifo gomtv
    curl -o "http://yourgomtvstreamlink" gomtv

In VLC:

    File-Advanced Open File (or Command-Shift-O)
    Check the "Treat as a pipe rather than a file" link
    Browse to desktop and choose the gomtv file
    Open

If the named pipe times ou on curl, just restart it.

Someone with more time than me could probably make this into a script. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do too.


I killed a terran, but he floated his CC and some other buildings away. i had some time to kill, so rather than chase him down, i spread creep to literally every possible corner of the map so he can't land. I even used overlords to transport queens on top of cliffs to spread creep.


Then, I built hatches everywhere randomly, killed all my units, and droned up to 200/200.


Then I built overlords.**Only** overlords. With 200 drones, money kept flowing in. So I kept building overlords.  My hope was to lag him so much that he quit or his system froze.  Mine might have also.  Didn't care.  With great rewards come great risks.

I got to over 350 before the other guy quit :(


Here's the results of my efforts:
