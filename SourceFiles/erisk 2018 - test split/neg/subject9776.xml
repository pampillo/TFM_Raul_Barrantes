And it got stuck there, not doing anything, not letting me back out or anything. Alt+F4. Upon re-launching the game, I get thrown into an endless queue with "Exit battle" freezing my screen with "Exit...", once again not being able to do anything else. Further Alt+F4'ing yelds the same result. Are the servers fucked (EU) or is this something fucky on my side? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, the reason people buy a Porsche SUV instead of a sports car is because they need a SUV and don't need a sports car.

You "can" daily drive a 911 but it's quite a bit of a pain and inconvenience (even though 911's are one of the few cars that you technically can daily if you really want to). So if you want your car to be an extension of your chosen genitals but at the same time actually use it every day all year round, you pick the Cayenne.

And fuck the Panamera. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a direct drive slow speed engine with fixed pitch propeller so the prop shaft is fixed permamently to the crankshaft. There is no transmission there, so if we want to stop, we have to stop the entire engine. It can also run both ways for forwards and reverse propulsion.

There are kinds of ships that utilize medium speed engines that require the use of a reduction gear because it would spin the prop too fast. You don't want the prop to spin too fast because it would just cavitate the shit out of the water, eat itself and not really go anywhere. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The dirty water is collected in special tanks called slop tanks. It can be (with several strict restrictions) discharged into the sea through special equipment called ODME - Oil Discharge Monitoring Equipment (duh) - that doses the discharge so only a certain amount of dirty water can be discharged over a given traveled distance. I can't really get into details about exact numbers because this is deck officer's responsibility that I don't really care about, lol. Of course any remaining amount of slop can be discharged to special port facilities.

In the engine room however, we need to take care about bilge water. Bilge water collects in bilges (duh), the spaces under the bottom floor of the engine room. It just gets there. Tiny leaks, condensation, blah blah there's always some water there and we need to get rid of it. This water also has some oil content in it because engine rooms aren't the cleanest spaces ever, also any spills and leaks eventually make their way into the bilges. We use a piece of equipment called the Oily Water Separator that cleans the water off most of its oil content. The regulations say that we can discharge bilge water with oil content that is no more than 15  ppm - parts per million. So basically oil can only be the 15/1000000 of the stuff we get rid of. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Like this!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfH7Ia8mwTA) Sea water is used to clean the tanks if necessary before hauling next cargo. There's "cargo compatibility" charts and shit that state if tank cleaning is necessary or is it ok for some cargo to get mixed with a tiny bit of remains from the previous one. Of course the magical spinny spraying thing cannot clean everything, so afterwards people actually go down inside the tanks and clean what's left.

The engine room is a loud place. You have to wear earplugs or headphones, some people use both. There's the main engine, at least one auxiliary engine and a shitton of electrical pumps, fans and shit all running in a single enclosed space. Shit's loud yo. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That is actually the primary forced draft fan for the auxiliary boiler, the blue cylinder seen behind it. There aren't many exhaust fans in the engine room, don't really need any. There's a lot of machinery that consumes ambient air inside the engine room (Main engine, auxiliary engine, auxiliary boiler, incinerator, probably something I'm forgetting). We have four large supply fans to keep positive pressure inside. If for some magical reason they all failed and we wouldn't know (VERY unlikely to happen), we'd pretty much fucking suffocate. Note the turbocharger seen under the exhaust duct (the biggest silver pipe thing going up) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also the sheer size of the props in relation to boat itself helps a lot. Check out drydock pics of modern tugs. The props themselves are called azimuth thrusters, they can indeed be controlled independently, turn 360 degrees and at various speeds as each prop is powered by its own engine. Thanks to that, the tugboat can move in whatever fucking direction it damn pleases so it can hold your shit together. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well they don't list the displacement in engine specifications, it's not really relevant. There is cylinder bore and piston stroke, though. I can't dig the needed stuff out right now, but I can tell you that you could fit at least three regular car engine blocks inside the cylinder of that thing when the piston is at bottom dead centre.

Edit: Found it. 500mm bore, 2000mm stroke. That calculates to roughly 393 liters per cylinder, so 2358 liters total. That's good for 9480 kW (just shy of 12713 HP) at ~127 RPM. And once again, this is considered a medium ship. My brother works on ships that have two of these. And IIRC the largest marine engines currently in use have a 960mm bore. </TEXT>

Edit: Yeah, upon taking a closer look I'm 100% sure that both the Hind and Apache models come from [Apache Air Assault.](http://www.gamescope.ru/gs-content/uploads/2010/11/apache_05.jpg)

Edit 2: And now having played it, the control scheme (albeit a bit broken) is also taken straight from the other game.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A priest that taught us religion in high school told us a story from back when he was attending "priest school" (I don't know the proper translation for it so let's stick with that). One of the faculty was named "KULAS" and his name was on the door to his office. But rather than a printed label or something, it was individual plastic letters stuck to the door. The priest told us that the bottom bar of the letter "L" would often mysteriously find its way to the top, making it into a "T", thus making the word into "KUTAS".

Kutas is polish for dick. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nope. I have a good memory of both games and also access to sophisticated scientific instruments such as google search, which allows me to look up soundtrack lists for NFSU2 and not a single one of them shows Get Low on them.

You might've had a somehow modded version, I don't say it's impossible.

It used to be a fearsome thing, these 12.7 russian gunners could shred pretty much anything behind it, especially if it was japanese. Nowadays with nerfed durability of larger aircraft it's mostly outgunned. And the crap bombload was always a major issue. This is a welcome change, might wanna dust it off at some point...

<TEXT> He's talking about a real gun. Operating a striker mechanism to fire actual rounds using electric power doesn't sound impossible, but insanely impractical and very unreliable, given the complexity of the mechanism that would also have to handle the recoil forces. Even if someone were to make the mechanism reliable enough to function for any prolonged amount of time, one would still have to lug additional batteries around to power it.

Unless of course the only thing the electric motor does is [spinning one part and the rest of the process is purely mechanical.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minigun) Then the battery isn't an issue because your shit is too big to carry around anyway so you have access to vehicle power. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-02-20 00:49:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This appears to be a common misconception that leads to people wondering why are they getting stupid comments from people not familiar with this somewhat niche game. 

The "Share to community" button (previosuly it was a checkbox saying "Share to imgur") makes the submission appear in the usersub section of imgur (user submitted images), visible to anyone currently browsing. This is where cancer happens.

You don't need to share to be able to link pictures to people. They simply won't pop up anywhere public. So do yourself a favor and don't do that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like /u/ProrokC2 said. It's not a direct translation, fortunately - because a direct word-to-word translation would sound incredibly stupid. Polish words are very flexible and by adding suffixes or prefixes of some sort their meanings can change entirely or sound more badass or soft. An example using images:

[Wieprz](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/wieprz-samiec-16573976.jpg) - [Wieprzu](http://static5.depositphotos.com/1008785/506/i/950/depositphotos_5060408-stock-photo-big-vietnamese-pot-bellied-pig.jpg) - [Wiepsio](https://userscontent2.emaze.com/images/a0867efb-9b7f-4796-92f0-11f3bf0eb904/98cfc6b9-adf5-4ae9-aab0-cac460deb3fd.jpg) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ye, these two guys were playing stupid, while they managed to get decent amount of kills and damage they also got themselves killed of quite early into the game. Third guy was AFK the whole time and then we had to capture the point all by ourselves against a seemingly endless wave of defender AI's... I couldn't believe when it was over. Might post a video of the last 5 minutes I got by shadowplay (unless AW has a replay function similar to WoT?)

Great job on carrying that. I only managed to do that because of the swingfire's ability to shoot from behind cover. Sure it's way more difficult with a fragile arty piece engaged in direct fire. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't get it to be honest, I'd probably laugh my ass off if I was the guy. Golf balls can't be that expensive to pull a hammy over them... can they?

Edit: $62 for a box of 12 professional brand balls. Seriously,  just over five bucks for a ball and I'm sure this guy was using cheaper. Come on, you're more likely to lose them in a pond than having them sent to space by a guy in a devil suit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since darkness is pretty much a natural state of objects that don't give off light by themselves, you don't ask if shadows are made of atoms. Shadows are spaces reached by a reduced amount of photons, or none at all, so basically we're talking pure-whatever-it-is-unlit. And that pure thing is made of atoms, so yeah. Everything else is that + photons.

And dreams are an effect of brain activity that is based on neurons, and neurons are weird ass chemo-electrical relays of sorts. And since electricity = flow of atoms and chemical substances are also made up of atoms, then go figure. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is only the next natural thing Rockstar should do. I mean, we already revisited Liberty City and San Andreas. If we don't see Vice City in the next game, I, along with thousands of other people, are going to be VERY pissed.

I like to think that we're not getting any of these classic supercars for V (think the testarossa Cheetah and the classic countach-y Infernus) because Rockstar is holding them for the new Vice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm having problems with making my submarine stay in level. The problem is weird because it acts like a half-full water bottle. If the stern starts sinking, it just keeps going unless I fire up my props and get the nose down... and then the nose starts sinking rather than trying to butt-dive again. 
I know people use jet stabilizers for that, but I can't tell if mine are working properly or not.

<DATE> 2015-09-06 21:52:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Even with three engines (144 cylinders each + all the necessary junk) and 61 huge props, 4.2 m/s is pretty much an unbeatable barrier for it. I had one engine with about half the props before that and the performance is still exactly the same.

[Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/RbYbpOg.png)

It's 387 blocks long with mass of 21552.33 whatever units this uses. 

Is there a limit as to what kind of speed can objects of certain dimensions/mass reach?

EDIT: Thanks for all the tips guys. The main issue was the fact that props were stacking one after another with no proper 8 block gaps, so with 61 props only like 7 produced thrust. Fail. </TEXT>

<TITLE> "External" oxygen level indicator and couple of other questions. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-08-17 00:39:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I haven't seriously played SE for quite a while, despite keeping up with updates and everything I just didn't have the time or the will to play around. But a couple of days ago I finally got back and started playing around with oxygen systems and I'm nearly done with my first large oxygen-enabled ship.

First of all, is there any way I can put up some sort of an indicator in front of an airlock to know if it's pressurized or not? When you have two entrance airlocks and three in the bulkheads across the ship, it's kinda hard to just keep mental track of it, and having to check the vent status through the door control panel is a pain in the lower back.

Second question, since I'm testing stuff out in creative as of now, the oxygen levels in my tanks are pretty much always 100%. Which becomes a problem when I want to de-pressurize an airlock, because the air doesn't have anywhere to go. I tried putting vents outside the ship, but they don't seem to function (oxygen doesn't drain, at least not in a reasonable time). I have to run on offline generators so the tanks aren't 100% full at all times. I'm not sure how much of a problem is this going to be in Survival mode, but I'd sure love to know a sensible solution.

Lastly, anyone else REALLY hating playing on DX11 because of the shadows/bloom making it pretty much impossible to build in some cases? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-05-18 14:11:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ever since my first contact with water, I hated swimming on my back. I need to see clearly what's in front of me, I don't like running into people or any other obstacles. This however doesn't seem to be an issue for most people I have to share the pool with. There's always at least two people on a single lane and I do my best to make sure I'm not getting in the way of anyone. Meanwhile others start doing the back thing aaaaaand pool day becomes a nuisance when they are going left and right all over the lane, forcing me to hug a wall or the divider (Sometimes even dive underneath) when they flail their arms all around as if they were the only person in the entire pool.

/rant. So here I am asking, does the backstroke stimulate any muscles that other styles can't? </TEXT>

It showed a plane that was floating on some lake/pond, however its electronics didn't get soaked and it was still working. So it basically became a boat and using its prop it managed to reach the edge of the lake where it was retrieved. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Subwoofer interference issues. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-10 13:10:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> With the recent movements around our TV table, we started to have some issues with our subwoofer cable. There's a clusterfuck of cables behind it and it was all moved around (We switched to a new internet service provider, which required a different setup than our old one), so it isn't any wonder that something might've happened there.

Tiniest movement of our HT setup (Denon DPB-2012UD drive and AVR-2312 amp) makes the subwoofer play the song of its people, sometimes the wub gets stuck until I wiggle the cables around.

Now, is that an interference issue with all the other cables back there (power, HDMI, audio and internet, loads of them) or perhaps it's some bendy bendy problem? How could I possibly improve the shielding on the woofer cable? (tinfoil wrap?) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey. I'm looking for a nice skybox to use, and since there's quite a lot of them around I don't really feel like downloading every single one and checking them out.

I'm looking for one that has preferably no planets, just a nice sci-fi'sh nebula-like texture to it. It also has to be somewhat dark. Not completely, as in you can somehow get around without using lights but they sure make things more comfortable. 

Any suggestions? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Right now as I noticed, your crew is rendered "knocked out" after it's reduced to just two members. (This probably differs between certain vehicles, I'm kinda basing it on a Tiger)

It'd be interesting to be able to continue fighting even with just one crew member left alive. We could get an option to move him between positions (mainly gunner and driver, with an option for machinegunner in the futire) via a context menu similar to the radio commands. It would take several seconds for the crew member to switch positions, and obviously there'd be added disadvantages (Driver is not skilled with gunnery, not to mention long reload time and vice versa.)

Why? Because I feel it'd add an intesting "last stand" aspect into the game, and [obviously, this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzgPXOw2plI#t=66) </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Suggestion] "Dynamic" music. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-12 12:18:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I love the music in Space Engineers. However, the randomness of the tracks being played is kinda annoying and often makes me mute the music in favor of playing something of my own in the background.

I'm building peacefully, and the music wants me to blow stuff up. I shoot up a poor private sail and the soundtrack just doesn't feel right, being calm and almost melancholic.

It'd be nice if the music had some triggers that would make a dynamic, fluent transition between played tracks.

For instance, for longer periods of just building with no fights going on, we could get calm music. If no building is being done at the moment and we just fly around space, the ambient tracks that seem to be bringing out the emptiness of space would come up. And when being 1 KM away from an enemy ship, or when there'd be a lot of gunfire going on, the more dynamic and "Kick some ass" music would start playing.

What do you think? </TEXT>

First of all, I'm sorry for the photo quality. The light conditions are pretty bad and I was too lazy to remove the cards from their sleeves, so that adds extra glare. Might update with better photos if I'll be able to get these in case this post attracts some attention (and I doubt that)

But for now, I'll just take the liberty of listing all of them here. They're listed in order, left to right (rows sorted by rarity):

Mythic Rare

* [[Sublime Archangel]] (this one holds sentimental value for me, as she was my first mythic rare ever)
* [[Admonition Angel]]
* [[Avacyn, Angel of Hope]] (my friends were really pissed off when I got her)
* [[Pristine Angel]] x2

Rare

* [[Aegis Angel]]
* [[Resolute Archangel]] x2
* [[Angel of Finality]] 
* [[Serra Avenger]]
* [[Avacyn, Guardian Angel]] (apparently you can never have enough of her)
* [[Reya Dawnbringer]]
* [[Angel of Glory's Rise]]
* [[Sunblast Angel]]
* [[Basandra, Battle Seraph]]

Uncommon

* [[Archangel]] x3
* [[Emancipation Angel]] x2 (these two ladies can make a lot of lulz)
* [[Goldnight Redeemer]] x4 (amass creatures, combine with [Rhox Faithmender], enjoy [Cloudshift]ing)
* [[Seraph of the Masses]] x2
* [[Serra Angel]] x4
* [[Angel of Mercy]] (use with Angel's Mercy just because names.)
* [[Illusory Angel]] x2

Common
 
* [[Voice of the Provinces]] x3
* [[Seraph of Dawn]] x4 (pulling these at early game usually means that this is going to be a good one)

(edited for formatting. How do I make these easier to view?)

<TITLE> I launched a rover to Minimus, but things went fubar and I had to settle on Mun instead. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First of all, excuse me for not providing pictures of the actual issue, for some reason I didn't think of taking any.

This is my trusty rig: http://i.imgur.com/SSeajHZ.png

It easily reaches Mun, so I figured to try and take it to Minimus, but I'm also pretty sure it can reach even further.

Anyway, after getting near Minimus things started to go crazy. Trajectory lines didn't make any sense, Minimus refused to be targetted - even though I made it the target as soon as I got onto LKO, at some point it ticked off and I couldn't set it as a target anymore. It turned green for a split sec and then displayed "No Target" message, or something among these lines.

Okay, I don't need that. I was very close and I could easily establish orbit. Yeah... provided that the maneuvering nodes worked. They didn't. When I tried to place a node, it started to go all over the place and I couldn't even adjust anything. I could only delete it from the staging view as it was literally escaping my mouse pointer.

Welp. No Minimus for me this time. Among all the trajectory lines I noticed that I can hit the Mun on the way back. Then everything went as planned, there were no issues and in a matter of minutes I detached my "[skycrane](https://i.imgur.com/DXg358F.png)" and [landed the sucker](https://i.imgur.com/L2t3DYk.png).

I'm still kinda pissed that Minimus refused to take me in, but oh well. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Half-working optical drive? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-01 18:45:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After recent problems with my dad's laptop, we're still not sure what to think of it.

The thing is, we were forced to install Windows off a USB drive because it wouldn't read the CD.  We thought that the optical drive was damaged, however after installing Windows it worked just fine, allowing us to install drivers and essential programs off our CD's.

Is it possible for an optical drive to be damaged in a way that it refuses to work on Bios level, yet works fine under Windows? What could be wrong? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Need help fast. Serious problems after HDD death. Windows won't install on a brad new HDD. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-29 18:58:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ok, so here's the story.
Yesterday the HDD in my dad's laptop died, the system hanged and wouldn't come back up after restarting. After a couple of quick moves (AKA trying to hook up the HDD to a different laptop and starting it up), I determined that the HDD died. There was a lot of important files on it and the HDD's gone to a recovery service but that's not the point.

We bought a new drive to get the computer up and working ASAP. And I quickly encountered numerous problems.

The laptop is a Samsung Q330, bought with Win7 64bit pre-installed. Turns out the "recovery CD" that you have to make is completely useless in an event like that, because it's designed to communicate with the recovery software installed on the computer. And that cannot be accessed. There's no OS on it, the computer does not recognize it as a bootable CD.

Anyway, I decided to install the OS from my own original Win7 CD. Here's the fun part. At first the laptop refuses to read the CD and returns "Operating system not found" message. After restarting, it actually loads up the CD and opens the Windows installation. However, the installation hangs at file extraction (0%) and after 5 or so minutes returns an error. Re-trying, same thing.

Now... after restarting yet again, it completely refuses to read the CD. Fasfasf.

Is it possible that literally everything went fubar aside from the HDD? What should I do? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-05-14 22:12:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, first of all: http://i.imgur.com/rLRIm8Z.jpg

52 ground kills. Yep, what the hell. It was a bit of a curious round, because I was only attacked by a single fighter and as you can see, I've taken care of that.

I didn't even take any damage from the attacker, so after dropping all my bombs I continued to fly around and kill the soft targets with my gunners, having decided that after that I would go and rearm to be able to finish off the remaining pillboxes.

And there's the point. As of right now, gunners have access to pretty much unlimited ammunition, with short pauses for reloading - and when you have your gunners maxed out, it takes just a couple of seconds. Pulling something like this off with a plane armed with actual offensive weaponry would require at least 3 landings. And that is, provided if the round doesn't end before that. Now, this still requires a lot of luck. The players on the opposing team weren't much on the smart side, so they were quickly down to two planes - one of them who died to another G8N1 by sticking to its tail (managed to make it crash in the end though), and another in a Yer-2, who then crashed as I was about to bomb the final pillboxes.

To be honest, I don't think that this is alright. I'm not sure how much ammo was there for gunner's disposal, but I'm pretty damn sure that it wouldn't be THAT much. Seeing as sometimes I had to fire off quite a bit of rounds before walking them on target, I must've spent over 7000 rounds there. That's a little over twice the amount of ammo the P-47 carries, and no other plane in the game gets to carry more than the Jug.

Basically, limiting the amount of ammo that gunners have to more realistic amounts would be one way of nerfing bombers and I do actually believe that something like this would need to happen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm 20 years old. It's been about two months since the procedure, in which I had my left teste removed. Right before the procedure itself, it was [the size of a potato](http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/farmer-holding-potato-yellow-hands-over-white-background-31849221.jpg). (edited: it's a picture of a guy holding some potatoes, SFW)

I'm not sure what kind of proof do you wan't, I've seen people posting pictures of their balls but I'm not doing it... well, not directly. [Here's a CT image of my junk.](http://i.imgur.com/245nCFF.jpg) You can see a darker area where the right teste is, on the left it's just a bunch of expanded nutsack skin.
[And here's a picture of my scar, not long after I had the stitching removed.](http://i.imgur.com/UWn4LIX.jpg)

In RB, everyone seems to be able to hit me with their first fired shell, no matter the range. I always have to walk my shots in order to hit anything, which is hard enough to do with all the smoke. It becomes pretty much impossible with big guns.

I have keys binded to sight distance control, but this doesn't seem to do anything to me. How do.

<TITLE> Njal Stormcaller and his psychic powers VS 6th Ed - spammity spam? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-10 15:49:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've recently gotten my first Psyker, Njal Stormcaller of the Space Wolves. And now I'm thoroughly confused by the unclear rules, as far as 6th edition goes. 6th Ed corebook speaks of Mastery Levels, Warp Charges and whatnot... Well, I was told to look for SW 6th ed FAQ and surely this explained a lot to me, but not everything.

http://www.games-workshop.com/MEDIA_CustomProductCatalog/m2420319a_Space_Wolves_6th_Ed_V1.pdf

Basically, it states that Njal has Mastery Level 2 and he can either stay with his original SW codex powers, or generate two powers from the corebook. 7 powers vs 2? Obvious choice for me.

See, the way his powers work seems a bit... well, overpowered. Njal Stormcaller knows all of the Rune Priest psychic powers - 7 of them, compared to the Rune Priests which have to pick just two of them. Furthermore, Nijal can use TWO psychic powers each round. While 6'th ed powers have a requirement of Warp Charges, Njal's powers have no requirements set whatsoever.

The Mastery Level of 2 seems to be set just for the requirements of rules for resisting psychic powers ("Deny the Witch" I believe it was called)

It's all pretty unclear and hard to believe. I know 245 points must mean SOMETHING but come on. The question is, can the same power be used twice in one round, or do they have to be two different powers? If the first statement  would be true... then it'd be Jaws of The World Wolf all over the place. </TEXT>

<TITLE> PSA: Bots are Stupid. Be a good sport about it and relay their position to the opposite team if there are no living players left. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-09 21:06:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We all know how much pain in the ass the AI's can be. The entire enemy team is dead, and there's only this one frickin' AI left. Too bad the clouds are at 1000 meters and you can't see crap - in the meantime, the bot decides that it's a good time to start some AI Space Program, climbing to 11 kilometers and taking a massive stinky turd on your time.

Most people just land and leave the game at this point, waiting either roughly 45 minutes for the round to end. Sure, you can also use this to grind ground targets in peace - well, not every map has soft targets and not everyone carries bombs.

I understand how annoying this is and I made my decision - If I happen to be the last player alive, after my death I will stick around and tell the other team where the pesky AI's hide. I already did this once, saving other player hours of looking for Alex hiding his peshka in clouds, way over the sea on Krymsk. I could feel his appreciation blowing from my screen.

I consider this to be a fair thing to do. We don't have to be assholes to the winning team by condemning them to eternal search for a space AI. So please, if you happen to be the last one alive on your team - after your death, be a kind person and tell the others where the AI's are. Thank you for reading.

<TEXT> So, this just happened to me right now. Zhengzhou (or whatever you spell it), I'm the last one alive in my Yer-2 against four japs. Russian server. My plane is barely flying, and suddenly these guys start talking to me in russian. I obviously couldn't understand what they were saying, so I said "No Russian" and then, with very broken english, this guy tells me that they won't kill me so everyone can farm ground targets while the game lasts. I couldn't believe it with my own eyes.

And it actually happened. After landing and re-arming (GOD THE YER-2 IS A PAIN TO TAKE OFF WITH) I was passing them while everyone was joyfully farming ground targets, me included. There was only one guy whom I killed because he attacked me, the remaining guys said that he was an idiot.

Unfortunately I died due do bad AAA dicerolls. And I was actually prepared to let them kill me after I'm done with bombing.

Faith in Russian WT players = restored. </TEXT>
