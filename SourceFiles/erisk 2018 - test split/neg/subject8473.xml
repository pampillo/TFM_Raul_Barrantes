<TEXT> This sounds like a blast! Here are some ideas for you:

Breakfast: Keep it simple. Cereal, milk, fruit juices, fruit, bagels, cream cheese. Go to a bulk store like Costco and buy some muffins, croissants, etc. Eggs to order is just too damn hard. Use the oven to cook bacon. Breakfast casseroles are always easy to prepare ahead of time. 

Lunch: Deli meats with all of the condiments (lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, mustard, etc.), pasta salads, potato salads, veggie platters, cookies (all things you can buy in bulk)

Dinner: Chili bar, taco bar, burger bar, grill lots of meats... essentially lay out a bunch of ingredients and let people make their own dinner so you don't have to worry about making something each person will like. 

Snacks: use a crock pot to make dips like queso or buffalo chicken dip! Have lots of tortilla chips, cheez its, cheese and crackers for people to munch on </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would recommend using a food processor or hand blender to make the sauce smoother. I've hand chopped everything before and it's a bit too chunky for my liking.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, you can't go wrong with some sort of open-face sandwich situation. I'd take some good bread, toast it, top with mashed avocado (salt, pepper, lemon juice), a sprinkle of red pepper flakes and top with a sunny side up egg. Add a slice of ham or bacon if she enjoys meat. It's simple and pleases just about everyone. Some fruit on the side would be nice.  </TEXT>

After a long, emotionally draining day, I called her to vent. She told me I needed to get these specific crystals, cleanse them and carry them with me in my pocket. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is one of my favorite appraisals from Antiques Roadshow. 

This man needed a sturdy watch so he bought a Rolex Daytona in 1973 for $543. Takes the watch with original papers and packaging to get appraised on the show only to find out it's a solid gold Paul Newman Daytona worth more than $100,000.

His reaction is priceless! </TEXT>

<TEXT> **CLARIFICATION: I did not buy only fake watches before this watch. I owned a few affordable quartz watches that I could wear every day and bang around. This is my first watch purchase that I'm super proud of. Hence calling it my first "real" watch purchase.**

Hi everyone! I'm new to the watch game and this subreddit.

Been wearing watches since middle school: Fossil, Baby-G, Casio, Timex but I figured since I'm in my late twenties, it's time to buy a "real adult watch." Saw this 1965 Seikomatic Weekdater and fell in love. I've never owned an automatic watch before and I can't believe what I've been missing out on!

As a female watch-lover, I was afraid it'd be a little too big for my wrist but this 38mm body looks perfect, I think. 

Loving this subreddit and can't wait to share my future purchases! </TEXT>
