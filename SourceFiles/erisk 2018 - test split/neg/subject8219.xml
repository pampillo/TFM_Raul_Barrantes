<TEXT> I once had a girlfriend who was anorexic. I first found this out on an early date where I took her to a tapas restaurant and ordered 40 worth of tapas. She ate a few bites of salad. I had to try and eat 40 worth of tapas. She then got paralytic drunk off two drinks...

How do you cope in social situations like this op? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ex drug user....

I suffer from insomnia really badly. And sometimes when you are really lacking sleep you experience some pretty altered states...

So looking back to the times I would go out on a Friday night and come home on a Sunday night without sleeping in all that time, taking lots of ecstasy acid and coke....i wonder how much of the high experience was just lack of sleep vs being off my tits  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mephedrone aka bubble aka miaow miaow aka mkat. 

I had had a break from drugs for a long time (5 years) and went on a mad night with a very crazy guy. I had some coke and just did that as anyone does...meh it was ok but its boring really...

Anyway ended up at this party. This was when legal highs were legal in the UK.  And this guy had like an ounce of Mephedrone. I bought a few grams and proceeded to snort and share, the promise it was like E but lasted half an hour was bullshit. I found it to be nothing like E. It was literally the most chemical high i had ever felt. After a few hours I felt so strung out...but not like off E. Just wired like my brain was frazzled. Jaw clenched and eyes rolling. 

It was not anything id do again. I was experienced with all drugs pretty much but hadn't had anything like that. A week later a guy died in that house, he thought he was snorting Mephedrone buy it turned out to be bzp. So God knows if it was even Mephedrone i did.

Alcohol is a drug for the masses. It is overrated shit.

Every time at the dentist. Just as he is about to start drilling. 

When we found our friend had committed suicide.

When I heard someone I know had a stroke.

<TEXT> True psychedelic use, i mean not just taking it for shits and giggles....leads to some revelations. Im talking about when you travel inside yourself. True mind expanding experiences. What did you learn?

Mushrooms made me realise how shit my 10 year relationship was. I realised I was deeply depressed. In one night when I saw things like people as marionette puppets and holes appearing in walls, i made a conscious inner decision to do what was at the time unthinkable and leave that woman. I've since lived on my own for a few years. At time its lonely, but a million  times better than living with a woman that does you down.

For that i thank shrooms.

Peace ! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Only told this story to one person in real life. And not thought about it for a long time. I'm a pretty fucked up person and when I remember all the parts to my past that made me fucked up its no wonder.

Here is my story of sexual abuse.

I was about 11 and everyone used to hang in a local park. I had a lot of problems at home and had decided to go out and play for a while. 

There was nobody about to play with so I just went down to this park anyway and was amusing myself climbing trees and stuff when this guy came over. The funny thing is to this day i cant even remember what he looked like. He just sort of grabbed my arm and dragged me into these really dense bushes that lined the back side of the park. 

Everything seemed to be a blur. But i remember him sticking a hand down my pants. Then (ill spare you the details). He raped me. I didnt know what it was or anything. I hadn't even discovered masturbation at this point. I was  a fucking kid.

I didnt tell anyone. And i wont. I told my girlfriend when we had been going out for a while. But not mentioned it since. 

I have lived my entire life with anxiety and depression. Been hooked on lots of drugs. And always found relaxing in intimate situations difficult.

I dont know man. Thinking about it. I just feel violated even now over 25 years later. Cunt. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Chewing tobacco??

Let me tell you a story. My first experience with any sort of chemical or drug was buying a cigarette off another boy at school. He gave me three matches to light it.  But as a complete newbie i broke the matches and looked at the cigarette wondering what to do. 

I had heard of chewing tobacco so assumed you just chewed the tobacco. I broke open the cigarette and put the loose dry tobacco in my mouth and went to my lesson chewing like an imbecile.

The burning sickly feeling came on quickly and within 2 minutes of being in class i threw up all over the table! Literally worst cigarette i ever had.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hannah baker in 13 reasons why.

I just finished it. I liked the series but honestly thought she was such a self indulgent snow flake who honestly put herself in a lot of bad situations.

1. Know you have a stalker peering in your window...have faux lesbian session with curtains open.

2. Entrap the school principle for not giving a shit enough to chase after her when she's behaving moribund. Not empathising he probably has dozens of depressed teenagers to deal with. And cos he didn't give all his attention to her....goes and slashes her wrists.

3. Instead of showing all the people they hurt in a productive way. Kills herself to teach them a lesson. Hence setting a terrible example to all young people watching! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Either way I would throw it. It could be all sorts of things. There was a fad back in the 90s to "smoke" poppers fags. They dipped the end of a fag in poppers (amyl nitrate), then without lighting it people would suck on it like smoking. Poppers were always shit in my opinion. 

I once went on a date to Blackpool with a girl and we were on the seafront, I was a but pissed and had bought a bottle of Poppers,  she was a boring girl and I decided to brighten things up by snorting the bottle repeatedly. I went dizzy and fell and hit my head.  Fuck Poppers. 

But it could also be PCP or some other fucked up chemical! Flush it down the toilet... </TEXT>

I dont so drugs anymore. I enjoy advising people etc and sharing my 2 decade knowledge of chemicals but one thing I don't understand...

When I used to trip, we used to just drop the blotter or micro dots or gels....we knew it as being "weak" or "strong". Like a dealer would say "that blotters not so strong you might need 2 or 3" or "those micro dots are mind blowing just take one"....but on here I see people saying they took 250 micrograms or whatever...how do people know what the dose is?

<TITLE> Mushrooms in Amsterdam </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-02 23:10:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> On a more cheerful note to my psychosis thread....

One of my craziest trips happened in 2005. Here's the story ! 

Speaking directly to those that use and abuse drugs...have you ever been fixated on a chemical or a drug or a plant? Like you want to do a drug. So research it like mad, reading everything you can? Looking up pictures excitedly...you are practically high off it before you do it. You are mentally wanking over the experience you want to have.

Well in 2005 i got that feeling. It had been a while. I had had a break from all substances and was basically a raging alcoholic. I was so unhappy, on citalopram for depression, miserable...i turned to the internet for some sort of excitement and found a site dedicated to magic mushrooms. 

My experience with mushrooms was a few trips off liberty caps which were brilliant,  back in the 90s. But I'd never seen anything like these psylocybe Cubensis.  I spent full evenings reading trip reports and looking at images of people's grow logs. I decided I simply had to do them. I needed to reawaken my mind.

I had a trip to Amsterdam booked for that summer, I used to go regularly, and this all just felt like fate as i had read that shrooms were legal in Holland  (they have since been made illegal). This would be it. I researched shops that sold them. I researched it all. Right down to the strain i wanted to try. Hawaiian. They just sounded and looked so exotic. They were rated as one of the stronger types, and I was looking for a mind blowing experience!

Fast forward a few months.  And i am disembarking from  the plane at schipol airport. Literally within half an hour i was at the magic mushroom gallery. And within one hour of landing i was in my creepy as fuck hotel room eating these raw mushrooms. I swear they tasted fucking grim. But nothing would or could stop me...the woman in the shop had recommended I take half the box. But I decided id take a bit more just to be safe. I was experienced and she didn't realise that (lol!)

Literally within half an hour i was on my ass. I was supposed to be meeting some friends in the city centre. They rang on my mobile....when I explained what I'd done they were equally amused and scared for me. I promised I would meet them but I needed some time to compose myself. 

With every ten minutes the visuals became more and more intense. It was a lot stronger than i expected,  patterns hung in the air, not like the familiar geometrics of acid, but 3D kaleidoscopic visions. I tried to get off the bed and i swear the floor was like mud swirling around my feet.

When there was a knock on the door i freaked the fuck out. Who was it?  What could they want. Could I even communicate in this state?....i literally crept to the door and looked through the spyhole. It was my friend I was supposed to be meeting. He has come. He had come to help me....i opened the door as though it might reveal monsters behind it. I couldn't tell whether it was day or night the patterns were so forceful. I just saw swirling shapes and 5he entire corridor seemed to be breathing. 

"Oh my God! " my friend exclaimed looking at me. "How much have you done?" When I told him he laughed and said "let's get you out of here". Its a good job Amsterdam is a liberal city as he literally held me by the hand and led me out of the hotel. 

On the streets, the people all looked like busy ants scurrying around so rapidly my vision blurred. I focused on the floor. Each step forward. One foot in front of the other. The paving slabs were like hexagons and each one i stood on lit up with bright white light. 

"Yes this is the right way!" I thought and grinned. My friend took me to a place called The Greenhouse. There all of my friends were stoned. Smoking skunk they laughed when they saw me and you know what, I felt this deep love like on E. 

I sat in this crazy place, surrounded by people smoking grass...the visions began to peak. I remember looking at my friend and thinking "why the fuck does he have a parrot on his shoulder?" Then looking back and it was gone. Nothing but a momentary pirate i thought. Nothing to be scared of. It was like i was slipping into a comfortable trip now after an intense come up. There was no questioning of what I was experiencing now. Only acceptance.  I knew this was as strong as it would get. I stopped fighting it mentally and just let myself go. I smoked some weed which made me feel so high. I had a pint of beer and i just looked around. I remember seeing a barmaid and thinking her hair was like me medusas snakes. A rowdy group of Americans looked like bloated toads, aggressively demanding things at the bar.

After a while we left the bar and i walked outside into the night. The buildings looked like lego. The canals looked like oil. Everything just seemed so fluid and connected. It was just so beautiful.

The trip eased off gradually in the coming hours, i felt tired and fuzzy headed. As intense as it was in the first hour, i knew it was something I wanted to experience again. And i did, many more times. 

Peace !

<TEXT> OP of the thread. Trust me I knew my shit. I had always used a lot of different substances and knew how to deal with everything from acid to coke. I did coke loads of times and never got hooked, I could take it or leave it. But meth. I couldn't stop. It was like living in a different world. For a start i had a few months where I felt like a God.  Then after that time. I was too screwed up and hooked to stop.

I genuinely thought I'd never be that guy. Even when my friends told me I was developing a habit, I still didn't think I was. I am now only addicted to smoking and its a similar pattern of addiction. Where it creeps up on you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wrote a long trip report on my psychosis from crystal methamphetamine. But here is another about LSD.

It was about 1997 and at Glastonbury back then it was full of new age type people. We were sat just chilling, smoking weed and drinking fruit cider when a hippy looking couple walked by saying "acid! Anyone want to buy acid?"....to say I chased them down like a wold on a sheep is an understatement. There was no doubt of this being real stuff cos these guys were so off their tits they just oozed the tripping vibe with massive eyes and big smiles.

I bought a few micro dots and a strip of alien logo blotter. I took one of the blotter and just went back to sit down with my mates. A few others dropped and we just relaxed as the acid came on strong. And it was very strong. I remember the sky looking like a nest of snakes. And we went on a walk through the crowds, tripping balls.

Now for the psychotic bit. It was one of those intense...not quite funny trips, where you feel like jumping up and running away. The paranoid anxiety at the back of your mind to compensate for the insane visuals. I was seeing people with painted faces like animals. The grass alive like worms....it was strong.

But not strong enough to stop me taking a micro dot and an E at the same time.

Cut to an hour later.

I was watching Pulp. Amazing band I loved so much. I was now in a different world. Disconnected. Hallucinating vividly. My bro pushed my arm and said "what are you watching?".... i was literally stood for an hour not watching the band play. Or the screens. I was staring into the darkness watching some really quite sick stuff. I saw psychedelic scenes but mixed with violence. I remember several images clearly. In one, police men beat a man in a gutter and in another a girl freaking out like in a horror film as someone chopped down her door with an axe. I was watching it like it was on a screen. But it was like a kaleidoscopic television. 

I dont think it was a bad trip. It was just an insane trip. Everywhere I looked was these insane scenes. At one point, the crowd looked like zombies with hollow eyes and glowing face paint.

It was intense and mind blowing. I was 17 and it has always stuck with me! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think my point is in the depths of addiction there is no using drugs mindfully. I didnt sleep because I was always on crystal. I took large amounts of it because after a year I was building up a tolerance which led to reckless dosing... there are some drugs that are just harmful period and thinking you can control it or do it in a less harmful way is exactly what I started out doing. Its that "it will never be me, I'll never be that guy" way of thinking that so many people think will keep them safe... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its like this, if i dropped acid back in the day, even when I had insanely strong micro dots where I was led there watching the world disappear and all i could do for 8 hours was say the phrase "its not working yet".... i knew in my mind I was on acid.

This was different. I believed the delusions 100%. One of the most disturbing things to me is this...i was in the woods believing all this. If an innocent person had approached me, well, I have no doubt it would have ended badly. To me at the time it was very very real. I wrote bad trip, but it wasn't really a trip. It was a true psychotic episode. I have since worked in mental health and it is the same experience as paranoid schizophrenics have  </TEXT>

I had a best friend from back then. He too went through a lot of what I did. We were best friends but the meth eroded that as we each began shutting down. 

I saw him a few months ago. The first time in about 15 years.  It was all good. When I commented on how crazy it was back then, he was walking off in his own direction and turned and said exactly the truth :

"It always stays with you" and it does . </TEXT>

<TEXT> The sad thing is, the anxiety and paranoia i got from that period has never left me. I tried to kill myself a few more times. And it was 3 years before I finally was clean of amphetamines. I got into a rehab unit and was prescribed dexamphetamine to wean me off the crystal. It was a truly horrible time man.

<TEXT> I talked briefly about this in another thread the other day and it had been a long time since I had thought about it. So I thought it may help someone if i tell this story. 

This happened to me almost 20 years ago now. 20 years later its still vivid in my mind it was so traumatic. 

The back story. 

In 1998 i moved from smoking pot to doing crystal methamphetamine. I remember the first few times,  I felt like a God.  I felt like I had discovered some secret. That the rest of humanity were weaker beings needing to sleep. I was full of life. Full of confidence and social. When I ended the nights out and went home, id lie there so wired i couldnt even blink. In my head running over fantasy scenarios and dreaming whilst awake. Dawn would come and id drop off to sleep. I had dropped out of work and was living off benefits which I used completely to buy crystal. It felt so good. 

This carried on for a while, I got confident, got a girlfriend. I hadn't had one for a few years  (im an ugly bastard!). Anyway. My confidence spiralled into egotistical wankerdom. I believed the grains of white crystal i held in my pocket were magic. Then one night this illusion swung violently into a nightmare...

That night.

I hadn't slept or eaten anything proper in days. I was wired to fuck already. I met my girlfriend, who in reality was a drugged up skank from a rough family and we went to this shitty local pub she liked. I went into the toilets and thinking "this place is shit, I'll liven it up about", I took out my baggy and proceeded to bomb double what I usually took. It seemed to hit almost instantly. I was in the cubicle and the rush was pure terror and anxiety. I sat there and heard a few guys come into the toilet. They were talking about me. They were plotting to beat me up.  I sat there with my heart pounding and eyes bulging thinking what will I do? What will I do...

I go out cautiously and there is nobody there. I go into the pub area and my mates are playing pool and drinking.  I try to pretend im ok but it must have been so obvious i wasnt. As one of my friends commented "you need to calm down on that stuff". My girlfriend said "let's get out of here you look crazy". So we went to her house which was just over the road. She said "ill make you a brew to help you calm down".

I sat there and my mind was racing. She was in on it. I never drink brews. She was trying to poison me. Or slip me some downers so the people in the pub could beat me up. I sat in the lounge on my own. And looking around i saw some tools her dad had out, he was installing laminate floor. There was a hammer and a few other bits. Then I saw it. A retractable Stanley knife. I picked it up quietly and slipped it into my pocket. Not even thinking what the fuck I was going to do. I just knew if these fuckers came.  I was going to defend myself. 

My girlfriend came in and gave me the brew. I put it down and obviously didn't drink that poisoned shit. The curtains were drawn, but I saw the shadows outside of a group of people. They were coming. I needed to get the fuck out of there. 

My girlfriend starts coming on to me. I pretended i was into it. THEN! seizing the element of surprise i push her off, jump up and shoot out of her house. I sprinted the fastest i have ever ran. Her house overlooked some fields at the back that led onto woods. I just ran and ran and ran. Once I was a good distance away i looked back and they were coming.  I saw them coming. Fast. So I turned and carried on sprinting. On that night I think I'd have given Ussain Bolt a run for his money.

I reached the woods and literally felt sick at the thought of going in. It must have been agouti midnight now and it was pitch black. There was no place else to go. I hurdled the fence and ran in. I found a densely overgrown spot and hid behind a tree. My heart pounding in my chest. My hand in my pocket slid out the blade of the knife...

I stayed quiet for what seemed like hours. I saw them. Theirs dark silhouettes and hooded heads. They looked big. Like body builder types. And there were loads of them. I heard them whistle to each other in some sort of code.

Then the worst thing ever happened.  The clouds cleared and the full moon shone bright light down, illuminating the woods and revealing where I was. I saw them moving between trees. They were playing a game. They were hunting me."just get it over with!!... what have I done to you??.....why are you doing this !" I screamed into the dark.  But still they didn't come. They just sort of circled around me in the woods. My mind raced to every person i might have pissed off. To think who could be behind this. I knew whoever it was, to have this many people out here in the woods. They were serious. 

"COME ON! COME AND DO IT THEN! I'VE GOT A FUCKING KNIFE" I literally screamed into the dark woods. It was probably now about 2am. The shadows just kept darting between trees only now... they looked small. Not even my height (I'm not very tall). The moon had gone back behind the clouds. But then all of a sudden  a bright white beam came down from  the moon to the middle of the woods. My mind then, and I remember with clarity, thought "i cannot believe this is an alien conspiracy, oh my God im going to be abducted, ill disappear and no one will ever know what happened "..... it sounds ludicrous in hindsight. But the terror i felt in that moment. I pulled out the knife. I thought. No. Id rather fucking kill myself than be taken by aliens.

The time now must have been about 4am because it literally started to grow lighter....i looked around in horror. The blade of the Stanley knife to my wrist. It was like my whole soul screamed "NO!"  

The light came fast. I looked around. There was no one. No beings. No people. Just me. I was freezing. My eyes were literally bulging out of my skull. A moment of clarity came smashing through all the horror. I collapsed to my knees and looked at myself.   I was covered in mud. Id actually cut into my arm and blood ran down my hand.. I was filthy. I sat there with my head in my hands crying for ages. What had my life become.

I pulled myself up and walked home. All the way, paranoid thoughts rushed through my head. People in cars stared at me. Men in white vans were going to pull up and bundle me into their vans. The reality was it was about 5am. There were hardly any cars about. The bad tripped lingered. I had to force myself not to look at the shadow people. I remember one vividly leaning on the bonnet of a car cradling a baseball bat. I forced myself to look down and just get home. Now the reality that it was a bad trip, was a thought I could understand. I felt distraught.

I got home. I got into bed. And i slept for two full days. 

I got up after that 48 hours, and I made a serious attempt to kill myself. 

My mum found me unconscious.

I was in hospital for 3 days. I woke up, discharged myself. And you know what? Went and scored some more meth.

Please. If you are young, or any age. Don't do that shit. It is evil. It is the worst most horrible thing. It will make you do terrible things to people you love. It will make you do terrible things to yourself.

It just is not worth it.

Peace guys !

<TEXT> I have terrible mental health problems and am just winging it every day. I work 3 jobs have 2 kids and spend the vast majority of my life doing everything for everyone else. When in reality im acutely depressed then acutely manic. I used to be a drug addict and alcoholic.  Now all I do is smoke. So I suppose there is that. 

There is so much i want to do. But my crippling anxiety holds me back. I live my whole life like im wearing a mask. And honestly some days i dont know how I make it through.

I dont think its right that he then gets the same amount of money as I do. I've also done missions where lazy bastards just sit in your car doing nothing and still get the same cut.

<TEXT> Youth mental health workers here.

I like the series. I am on episode 6. Its intriguing and interesting. However I do feel it gives a glamourised view of teen suicide.

The thought that you can teach all the bullies and nasty people a lesson by killing yourself...it may look attractive to a young person. Just like when they televise school shootings and more happen..

Ultimately if a kids thinking seriously about suicide they will do it regardless. 

As an adult and a parent, and indeed a youth mental health worker....its terrifies me the culture that glamourises and minimises suicide. Look at the stupid fucked up and sick thing that is the blue whale challenge. I think more needs to be done to prevent suicide in young people. I'm not saying 13 reasons will drive kids to kill themselves. I just think it missed am opportunity to show kids a better way </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ex amphetamine addict.

I was on meth for 2 years then hooked on dexamphetamine to come off the meth.

Seriously. Now listen. 

I am 36. That was when I was 18-24. I am now an upstanding member of society. My teeth are fucked. I have almost all my top back ones missing and three crowns in the front.

I am a paranoid anxious person that has generalised anxiety and bipolar disorder. I've attempted suicide several times and my arms are covered in scars from self harm.

I started out having a great time on meth! Just like you bombing it and buzzing off the rushing thoughts and amazing energy. To this day i obsessively clean like i learned to on meth.

You know what? I thought "just once and ill never get hooked"

Then it was just once a week.

Then it was a night during the week

Then every other day

Then daily.

Then multiple times a day

Bigger and bigger doses.

Until I entered psychosis. I had the worst night of my entire life. To this day it fucks me up to think of what I hallucinated. I might write it up in a thread sometime. 

Long story short. Don't do meth dude. Its just not worth it. I took most drugs and never regretted fuck all. But I regret taking meth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This poem, particularly the last line has always struck me hard in the feels. Its my favourite of all time. 

I Go Back to May 1937
By Sharon Olds
I see them standing at the formal gates of their colleges, 
I see my father strolling out 
under the ochre sandstone arch, the   
red tiles glinting like bent 
plates of blood behind his head, I 
see my mother with a few light books at her hip 
standing at the pillar made of tiny bricks, 
the wrought-iron gate still open behind her, its 
sword-tips aglow in the May air, 
they are about to graduate, they are about to get married,   
they are kids, they are dumb, all they know is they are   
innocent, they would never hurt anybody.

hes the wrong man, you are going to do things 
you cannot imagine you would ever do,   
you are going to do bad things to children, 
you are going to suffer in ways you have not heard of, 
you are going to want to die. I want to go 
up to them there in the late May sunlight and say it, 
her hungry pretty face turning to me,   
her pitiful beautiful untouched body, 
his arrogant handsome face turning to me,   
his pitiful beautiful untouched body,   
but I dont do it. I want to live. I   
take them up like the male and female   
paper dolls and bang them together   
at the hips, like chips of flint, as if to   
strike sparks from them, I say 
Do what you are going to do, and I will tell about it. </TEXT>

Firstly. You rape a kid then death really needs to vs a punishment. I has a physically abusive upbringing. I would never smack my own children. Its no justification  to blame your past. Each and every person makes a conscious decision on how they will behave. Fact.

Secondly I do believe they should be rehabilitated where possible. Then given jobs somewhere like an oil rig where they are miles from any children.

<TEXT> Methamphetamine addiction. Its about 14 years later and ive never been the same since.

The massive dose of mushrooms that ended a 15 year ride with psychedelics. Id taken plenty of acid, and that year  i had been taking regular and increasingly strong doses of Cubensis. One night I was just reckless and took a large unmeasured dose. It blew my mind. Made a damn lot of changes in my life after it.  But never took psychedelics again. The way I explain it to people is this. I saw what I had always been searching for.

It sounds stupid to people in general. But I saw the light at the centre of the universe. The all seeing all consuming presence. I had left a religion i was raised in. And had pretty much been lost for a long time in constant drug abuse. Im not saying this experience made me religious again, but I felt a presence that was godly. It was beautiful. And it felt safe.

With both though it's always the same "set and setting" that make for a safe trip.

Just look after yourself. I did a lot of shrooms a long time ago and ended up a mess! </TEXT>

<TEXT> My early life progressed like this...

14-18 smoking cannabis daily
18-22 taking amphetamine daily
18-30 taking ecstasy, coke regularly
Sporadically the entire time taking shrooms and acid
Chuck in random sideline addictions of benzo, codeine, nicotine, bouts of alcoholism....

My entire formative years revolved around drugs. It was literally all i surrounded myself with. All the people I was involved with took drugs. I was obsessed with anything drug related. I thought I was some cool counter culture rebel. In truth I was a fucked up drug addict who was masking a million and one issues from my childhood.

Whilst ill talk at length about mind blowing experiences i had on psychedelics and crazy times at festivals and raves. The truth is, inside i was so unhappy and lonely. In the year I was 18 i tried seriously to kill myself twice (thankfully I survived). I am 36 and my arms are full of the scars where I would cut myself just to feel something. 

I left drugs behind. I then turned to abusing alcohol. Getting drunk every night. Id sleep in a stupor. 

Fast forward to now.  I'm mid thirties. I dont take drugs. I drink about twice a year, I smoke cigarettes which I want to quit, but in general I am making it through life sober. I did it all with the help of the woman I love.

I dont regret my past. But I don't like the damage i did to myself mentally. I live in a state of almost permanent anxiety that holds me back.

I still feel depressed most of the time to be honest. I struggle to cope. But I do.

Id advise anyone that is young and starting taking drugs, to just maybe consider pursuing other things. I've seen my best friends turn into fuck ups. People end up in prison and dead. Its real life. And no amount of thinking you are invincible can ever protect you from shit you might carry within.

Im sorry to go on!

Like the time i took a large dose of LSD at a festival and had some insane visuals....the first time I took Ecstasy and felt the love, first few times I took crystal amphetamine and stayed awake for days, first time on mushrooms...

I guess it's being young and carefree enough to do those things that I miss. Now, real life, just seems like one long conveyor belt of routines...think I'm a bit depressed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It never leaves you...those experiences stay with you forever! Good and bad.

It must be 8 years since I touched a drug. The last experience I had was a mind blowing mushroom trip. And since then its like i just never wanted to again.

But often, like daily i find myself thinking about the old times, endless nights sat up high as a kite, insane trips on acid are my favourite memories from my younger years.

So my question is to ex users of substances....what do you miss the most?

<TEXT> That was me.

Raised a jehovahs witnesses i stood out.

Big nose. Shit hair. Spots. Socially awkward.

I was a prime target for bullying.

Until I snapped around about 14 or 15. I started fighting back. Started taking drugs smoking and drinking etc. Anything to distance myself from the former me.

Still was weird only now a bit crazier. I left school with no qualifications.....went on to graduate university. I work two jobs have two beautiful kids. Don't do drugs etc and am a decent guy....still ugly though!   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah. Basically you have to find the car and take it to your warehouse.  Once you claim it usually you get pursued by a shooting helicopter or some pricks in cars.. they might shoot up your car and you have to pay to have it repaired. The same happens when you go to deliver the car to a buyer.. any damage is deducted from the final payment. Its usually a few thousand out of a hundred thousand pay out. Plus other players get a notification to destroy your car for RP and money.

I personally wait until I end up In an empty lobby to sell my top end cars! </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1408 is a brilliant head twisting film.

Don't know if anyone else could relate,  but sometimes on higher doses of LSD (I took it quite a lot in the 90s), you would get locked into thought and hallucination loops where you would feel like you were experiencing the same thoughts and visions over and over again. 1408 gave me that same feeling! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I lived in a very modern apartment. Hated the community. Full of douchebags. Ended up the only positive was the place was very modern and decorated well.

Moved to a more dated property (textured wallpaper in every room). 

The lesson I learned was apartment living is not for me. And that the best most modern decor means nothing if you are surrounded by imbeciles that like to cram as many people into their small property to blast out club music, completely disrespecting the 40 other apartments that want peace 

Tl;dr - go for a less stylish house in a better area than a more stylish house in a worse are.

Yes it's true! </TEXT>

$700,000,000 a year from online alone. That is good business.

This new one is meh. Didnt even bother finishing the three rounds it was so boring. No skill or strategy involved. It was like those pointless park our death matches but even less exciting. 

I do love the game and love that they still add content, but considering they make 700 million dollars a year out of online alone....i think they could do a bit more!

<TEXT> He wasn't born! It was his uncles and aunties that got sent to death.

My grandad was imprisoned by the nazis but forced to work as he was a strong 17 year old. They kept him prisoner for four years, fed him next to nothing and beat him. 

He was a pretty crazy guy after. Drank a litre of vodka a day and smoked 20 cigarettes. He just was obviously deeply traumatised. But in them days you were expected to just get on with it.

Wasn't all bad though! It's a lovely story of how he met my grandma and they had a long and happy marriage  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lot of my dad's side of the family died in auschwitz. It is unimaginable that people can be so wicked. 

There was a comedy sketch i think it was Fry and Laurie that had the soldiers in SS style uniforms saying "look at the skulls on our uniforms, are you sure we are the good guys"

And like ISIS today. When they are there killing innocent people, like the nazis packing the gas chambers.....how on earth can people become so poisoned to believe such heinous acts are ok.

<TEXT> I am a single dad to two girls.

Here are some things I had to learn (fast):

1. Youtube is a godsend for learning how to do girls hair. I have always shaved my head so had no idea how to do it. Now I can do pony tails buns and plaits

2. Periods. When they start its horrific.  She was too embarrassed to say, I only found out cos I went in the bathroom and there was blood everywhere she had obviously tried to clean up. I went to the shop, and after getting a basket full of sanitary towels like some sort of pic and mix, I just asked a woman in he aisle for advice on what to buy.

3. Enlist female help. I luckily have a sister who can help.

My eldest is also autistic so it's really hard sometimes. But you can do it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> For over 20 years I have loved Stephen Kings work. However it is mostly disappointing how they put it into film.

The original Shining,  whilst a decent film, was not enough like the book. The remake miniseries was more like the book but with less likeable casting. 

Carrie, I like both the original and the remake! 

Under the Dome was so boring to watch...

Hearts in Atlantis the film just had no real feel of the book to me.

I cannot wait to see It when it comes out...the trailer does look good!

I would love to see -

A good adaptation of Insomnia, Dr Sleep, firestater A The Talisman  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi guys, 

I don't really like MC as a whole, and can't believe I wasted so much money upgrading the farm...but I have almost made the money back. 

Here is what I do. Do two runs of stealing supplies (i just steal a merry weather helicopter and it takes a couple of minutes. This usually gives between 2 and 4 bars of supplies. I then sell this usually for 60-70,000. I do all deliveries in public sessions solo. I have only had one delivery destroyed!

Completely agree the delivery missions in vans and bin wagon are completely awful. Why would a motorcycle club use the slowest vehicles???

Rockstar should allow you to sell your business if you don't want it!
