<TEXT>  On 3 August 2014, ISIS launched a coordinated attack on Sinjar City and surrounding towns and villages, forcing Yazidis to seek refuge on Mount Sinjar. Those who could not flee in time were either killed or kidnapped [6]. As ISIS encircled the mountain on 4 August, tens of thousands of Yazidis remained trapped without water, food, or shelter in temperatures rising above 50C. At the request of the Iraqi government, United States airstrikes and humanitarian aid airdrops began on 8 August; helicopter rescue missions were initiated a few days later. Most Yazidis were evacuated between 913 August when a safe corridor was opened by Kurdish forces, allowing them to flee through Syria into the Kurdistan Region of Iraq [7].

The vast majority of Yazidis reached Kurdistan by mid-August 2014, where they found temporary shelter in hundreds of informal settlements, including schools, community spaces, and unfinished buildings. As schools were needed for the beginning of the academic year and some property owners requested the government to clear their properties, displaced Yazidis were gradually transferred to newly built camps [8]. More than 300,000 Yazidis have settled in Kurdistan, with over half in camps managed by the Kurdistan regional government and the balance still scattered in construction sites and unofficial tented settlements [8,9]. A relatively low number of Yazidis have settled elsewhere: by 2015, it was estimated that some 10,000 remained in tents on the north side of Mount Sinjar under Kurdish control, nearly 15,000 were reportedly in refugee camps in Syria, and at least 30,000 were known to have crossed into Turkey [1012].

Soon after the events of August 2014, the United Nations Human Rights Council dispatched a mission to Kurdistan to document the scope of ISIS violations of international human rights law. The mission report asserts that members of ISIS may have perpetrated genocide against the Yazidi community by killing, causing serious bodily or mental harm and forcibly transferring members of the group, including children, in the context of a manifest pattern of conduct aimed at the destruction of the group and that further investigation is needed to establish the precise number of those who continue to be held by ISIS as well as the numbers killed, estimated to be in the thousands [13].

Some attempts have been made to compile lists of those affected. Kurdish authorities and human rights organisations have reported to the United Nations that between 2,000 and 5,500 Yazidis were killed and more than 6,000 were kidnapped; however, the United Nations has not yet been able to independently verify these figures [14]. Between 4 November and 25 December 2015, we conducted a retrospective household survey to provide the first population-based estimates of the number and demographic profile of Yazidis killed and kidnapped by ISIS.

<TEXT> Hmm im not exactly hopeful when industries on the board have factored a 4c increase in warming into their future plans. Oh and also a highly respected  scientist called Ivanka Trump has an influence on policy


President Donald Trump's daughter, Ivanka, will meet with Cabinet officials and department heads in the next two weeks to discuss a variety of issues, including the Paris climate accord, Politico reported.

The website dubbed her planned series of meetings: "Ivanka's Listening Tour."

She is scheduled to meet with EPA administrator Scott Pruitt on Monday and Tuesday to discuss whether the administration should pull out of the Paris climate treaty, Politico said.

And Axios reported the president is inclined to abandon the pact, but his daughter is determined that he hear all the facts before he makes a decision.

<TEXT> Do you really trust governments who will produce reports around climate change who have a conflict of interest? In this case America with Exxon Mobile and Saudi Aramco producing  future climate change reports. I kid you not.

 108 national and international environmental organizations sent a letter to the chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to raise their concerns about the selection of authors for the special report on the impacts of global warming, which the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will present next year. One of the selected authors (proposed by the US government) works for ExxonMobil, another for the Saudi oil company SaudiAramco. The signatories criticize that this selection does not correspond to the internal policy of the IPCC. It would actually constitute a violation of IPCCs own conflict of interest policy.

Writing in the Lancet, researchers from the UK and Sweden describe how they carried out research between 1998 and 2004. More than 10,000 at-risk patients  predominantly white, male and over 60  were randomly allocated to one of two groups, either taking statins or a placebo, and followed for more than three years. Neither the participants nor their doctors knew which group they belonged to.

In the second part of the study, 9,899 of the patients had the medication or placebo stopped, and both groups were then given the option of taking statins. The patients were then followed for more than two years. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Common side-effects of statins are not down to the drugs, but are instead a result of patients negative expectations, research suggests.

Statins are typically prescribed to help lower levels of bad cholesterol  or low-density lipoprotein  in order to reduce the risk of a heart attack or stroke. A recent report estimated that the drugs prevent around 80,000 such incidents a year in the UK.

Despite their benefits, statins have been caught up in a storm of controversy, with critics questioning the safety and efficacy of the drugs after NHS guidelines advised that prescriptions should be extended to those at lower risk of heart attack.

But the new study suggests common side-effects of muscle pain and weakness are not a result of the drugs themselves, but rather patients negative beliefs about the medication  a phenomenon known as the nocebo effect.

You only get the muscle-related symptoms when you know you are taking the drug, Peter Sever, lead author of the study from the national heart and lung institute at Imperial College London.

He added that it was important to note that patients are not imagining their pains. Patients genuinely get the symptoms, he said. But you cannot attribute that, in this case, to the drug.

<TEXT> Increasing the percentage of elementary school children in the United States who participate in 25 minutes of physical activity three times a week from 32 percent to 50 percent would avoid $21.9 billion in medical costs and lost wages over the course of their lifetimes, new Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health research suggests.

The findings, published May 1 in Health Affairs, suggest that just a small increase in the frequency of exercise among children ages eight through 11 would also result in 340,000 fewer obese and overweight youth, a reduction of more than four percent. If all current eight- through 11-year-olds in the United States exercised 25 minutes a day, three times a week, the researchers suggest that $62.3 billion in medical costs and lost wages over the course of their lifetimes could be avoided and in 1.2 million fewer youths would be overweight or obese.

These numbers represent cost savings for one cohort of eight-to-11 year olds, so every year that children in this age group reach those levels of physical activity, over $60 billion more will be saved.

"Physical activity not only makes kids feel better and helps them develop healthy habits, it's also good for the nation's bottom line," says study leader Bruce Y. Lee, MD, MBA, executive director of the Global Obesity Prevention Center at the Bloomberg School. "Our findings show that encouraging exercise and investing in physical activity such as school recess and youth sports leagues when kids are young pays big dividends as they grow up."

Studies have shown that a high body mass index (BMI) at 18 is associated with a high BMI throughout adulthood and increases the subsequent risk of developing diseases such as diabetes and heart disease associated with being overweight or obese, which can lead to high medical costs and productivity losses due to illness. In recent decades, there has been a growing epidemic of obesity in the United States.

For the study, Lee and his colleagues, including team members from the Bloomberg School and the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center at Carnegie Mellon University, developed a computational simulation model utilizing their VPOP (Virtual Population for Obesity Prevention) software platform to represent the current population of U.S. children and to show how changes in levels of physical activity could affect them throughout their lifetime and the resulting economic impact. The model relied on data from the 2005 and 2013 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) as well as information from the National Center for Health Statistics. The medical costs and the lost wages were calculated in the second model, which looked at the lifetime effects of physical activity.

The researchers also looked at various levels of healthy physical activity, starting with the current average of 32 percent of children ages eight to 11 who exercise for 25 minutes a day, three days a week, up to 100 percent doing so. That is a guideline developed by the Sports and Fitness Industry Association. The researchers found that maintaining the current level of physical activity would result in 8.1 million of these youths being overweight or obese by 2020, which would cost $2.8 trillion in additional medical costs and lost wages over their lifetimes. An overweight person's lifetime medical costs average $62,331 and lost wages average $93,075. For an obese person, these amounts are even greater.

"Even modest increases in physical activity could yield billions of dollars in savings," Lee says. The costs averted are likely an underestimate, he says, as there are other benefits of physical activity that don't impact weight, such as improving bone density, improving mood and building muscle.

Lee says that the spending averted by healthy levels of physical activity would more than make up for costs of programs designed to increase activity levels.

"As the prevalence of childhood obesity grows, so will the value of increasing physical activity," he says. "We need to be adding physical education programs and not cutting them. We need to encourage kids to be active, to reduce screen time and get them running around again. It's important for their physical health -- and the nation's financial health."

What bit are you stuck on exactly? Here is another article about it.

Unlike simple models such as disease contagion or transmission of news, which need only one exposure to infect or inform the next individual, the spreading of protests is more complex, making it less certain, said Steinert-Threlkeld, who teaches courses on these topics at the undergraduate and graduate levels at UCLA Luskin.

"Having someone tell you, 'Hey, I'm going to protest tomorrow' is much less impactful than having multiple people tell you they are protesting tomorrow," he said. Large groups of people, as opposed to a few central individuals, are able to discuss "where to go, how to get there, when to go," as well as what is going on once there, Steinert-Threlkeld added. In addition, individuals debating whether or not to protest must receive a credible signal that large numbers of people are protesting.

"Protests are a complex contagion phenomenon because increasing participation makes others more likely to join," Steinert-Threlkeld said, pointing out that because more individuals are on the periphery than in the core of a network, protest is more likely to occur where the larger group is located. "The decision to participate in a protest appears to be driven by normal people taking cues from each other, not from elites."

<TEXT> The longer one experiences unemployment in the United States, the more likely they are to report symptoms of psychological unease, according to a recent Gallup poll. The poll also found that one in five Americans without a job for a year or more report that they have been or are currently undergoing treatment for depression. This is roughly double the rate of depression among those who have been without a job for fewer than five weeks. 

According to research reported in the Journal of Vocational Behavior, unemployed people are twice as likely as employed people to suffer from psychological problems (34 percent to 16 percent). Blue-collar workers are more distressed by unemployment than those who've lost a white-collar job. Additionally, middle-aged men and women, especially those who are unemployed, experience the highest levels of psychological distress.

<TEXT> The findings refute the theory that the brain always behaves optimally. How the brain adjusts learning, has long been thought to be driven by the brain's reward system and its goal of optimizing rewards obtained from the environment or by a more cognitive system responsible for learning the structure of the environment.

Synapses are the connections between neurons in the brain and are responsible for transferring information from one neuron to the next. When it comes to choice in evaluating potential rewards, your learned value of a particular option, reflecting how much you like something, is stored in certain synapses. If you get positive feedback after choosing a particular option, the brain increases the value of that option by making the associated synapses stronger. In contrast, if the feedback is negative, those synapses become weaker. Synapses, however, can also undergo modifications without changing how they transmit information through a process called metaplasticity.

Previous studies have suggested that the brain relies on a dedicated system for monitoring the uncertainty in the environment to adjust its rate of learning. The authors of this study found however, that metaplasticity alone is sufficient to fine-tune learning according to the uncertainty about reward in a given environment.

"One of the most complex problems in learning is how to adjust to uncertainty and the rapid changes that take place in the environment. It is very exciting to find that synapses, the simplest computational elements in the brain, can provide a robust solution for such challenges," says Alireza Soltani, assistant professor of psychological and brain sciences at Dartmouth. "Of course, such simple elements may not provide an optimal solution but we found that a model based on metaplasticity can explain real behaviors better than models that are based on optimality," he added.

To understand the neural mechanisms for adjusting learning, more specifically, how learning and choice are impacted by reward uncertainty and volatility in an environment, the researchers created a model based on metaplasticity. They tested this model against a behavioral dataset from a recent Yale University study of non-human primates in which the probabilities of obtaining a reward were switched to create environments with different levels of volatility. When things change frequently, a large learning rate is required but this reduces precision, whereas, a stable environment requires a small learning rate, which improves precision. The study illustrates how metaplasticity can mitigate the tradeoff between adaptability and precision in learning.

The metaplasticity model also demonstrates how the learning rate might be different for each choice or option. If a particular choice continues to give reward for a while, the learning rate on that option becomes larger for rewarding outcomes and smaller for non-rewarding outcomes. That is, if the environment does not change, the synapses needed for changing the preferences become less sensitive to feedback in the opposite direction. In addition, the model also predicts that different options or actions could maintain their own learning rates.

This study demonstrates that learning can be self-adjusted and does not require explicit optimization or complete knowledge of the environment. The authors propose potential practical implications of their findings. The brain's inability to modify its behavior may be attributed to the slowing down of plasticity due to metaplasticity, which can occur in a highly stable environment. For behavioral anomalies such as addiction, where the synapses might not adapt flexibly, more carefully designed feedback may be required to make the system plastic again, illustrating how metaplasticity may have broader relevance.

<TEXT> In two studies, researchers found that adults were very good at remembering information they were told to focus on, and ignoring the rest. In contrast, 4- to 5-year-olds tended to pay attention to all the information that was presented to them - even when they were told to focus on one particular item. That helped children to notice things that adults didn't catch because of the grownups' selective attention. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A new study of young adults in seven countries shows that media violence is a strong contributing risk factor toward aggressive behavior, regardless of culture. The findings are published in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin.

For the study, researchers at Iowa State University (ISU) surveyed 2,154 adolescents and young adults in Australia, China, Croatia, Germany, Japan, Romania, and the United States. The average age was 21 years old and 38 percent of participants were male. Participants were asked to list their most frequently watched or played TV shows, movies, and video games, and to rate the level of violence. The researchers also collected data on aggressive behavior and empathy.

The research team identified four key findings from the study:

Violent media use was positively and significantly related to aggressive behavior in all countries
Exposure was related to heightened aggressive thinking and lowered empathy
Media violence remained significant even after controlling for other risk factors
The effect of media violence was larger than all other risk factors, except peer delinquency
This is strong evidence that the main psychological processes that cause repeated media violence exposure to lead to increased aggressiveness are essentially the same across cultures, at least during normal times, said study leader Craig Anderson, an ISU distinguished professor of psychology.

However, we believe that local cultural and social conditions may influence such processes when those conditions are more extreme.

Anderson went on to explain that in war-torn societies, media violence exposure may have heightened effects due to the real violence children and teens experience on a daily basis. On the other hand, the media violence effect could be smaller in such extreme conditions.

In addition to measuring media violence, the research team looked at five other risk factors of aggressive behavior: neighborhood crime, peer delinquency, peer victimization, gender, and abusive parenting.

Combined, these factors significantly predicted aggressive behavior and as a group were more powerful than any individual factor. The findings show that media violence was the second most important predictor.

Below are the six major risk factors of aggressive behavior and how each contributes to overall risk:

Peer delinquency  28 percent
Media violence  23 percent
Peer victimization  17 percent
Gender  12 percent
Neighborhood crime  11 percent
Abusive parenting  nine percent
The findings strongly suggest that media violence is similar to other known risk factors for aggression, said Douglas Gentile, an ISU professor of psychology and one of the co-authors.

Thats not to say media violence deserves special attention, but that it should be considered as seriously as other risk factors such as coming from a broken home. What matters most, however, is not any single risk factor, but how they can combine to increase the risk of aggression.

Anderson notes that although the findings were based on self-reports and the study was cross-sectional, the large, diverse sample allowed for direct comparisons of media violence effects across many cultures.

The study also disproves claims by the entertainment industry that dismiss all media violence effects.

There are highly motivated groups dedicated to denying scientific findings of harm, such as the tobacco industrys decades-long denial of harmful effects of their products on cancer, Anderson said. This study clearly contradicts the denialism that currently dominates news media stories on media violence effects.

To understand the Casimir Effect, one first has to understand something about a vacuum in space as it is viewed in quantum field theory. Far from being empty, modern physics assumes that a vacuum is full of fluctuating electromagnetic waves that can never be completely eliminated, like an ocean with waves that are always present and can never be stopped. These waves come in all possible wavelengths, and their presence implies that empty space contains a certain amount of energy--an energy that we can't tap, but that is always there.
Now, if mirrors are placed facing each other in a vacuum, some of the waves will fit between them, bouncing back and forth, while others will not. As the two mirrors move closer to each other, the longer waves will no longer fit--the result being that the total amount of energy in the vacuum between the plates will be a bit less than the amount elsewhere in the vacuum. Thus, the mirrors will attract each other, just as two objects held together by a stretched spring will move together as the energy stored in the spring decreases.


This effect, that two mirrors in a vacuum will be attracted to each other, is the Casimir Effect. It was first predicted in 1948 by Dutch physicist Hendrick Casimir. Steve K. Lamoreaux, now at Los Alamos National Laboratory, initially measured the tiny force in 1996.

It is generally true that the amount of energy in a piece of vacuum can be altered by material around it, and the term "Casimir Effect" is also used in this broader context. If the mirrors move rapidly, some of the vacuum waves can become real waves. Julian Schwinger and many others have suggested that this "dynamical Casimir effect" may be responsible for the mysterious phenomenon known as sonoluminescence.
One of the most interesting aspects of vacuum energy (with or without mirrors) is that, calculated in quantum field theory, it is infinite! To some, this finding implies that the vacuum of space could be an enormous source of energy--called "zero point energy."

But the finding also raises a physical problem: there's nothing to stop arbitrarily small waves from fitting between two mirrors, and there is an infinite number of these wavelengths. The mathematical solution is to temporarily do the calculation for a finite number of waves for two different separations of the mirrors, find the associated difference in vacuum energies and then argue that the difference remains finite as one allows the number of wavelengths to go to infinity.

Although this trick works, and gives answers in agreement with experiment, the problem of an infinite vacuum energy is a serious one. Einstein's theory of gravitation implies that this energy must produce an infinite gravitational curvature of spacetime--something we most definitely do not observe. The resolution of this problem is still an open research question.

The study suggests that women value physical attractiveness in a potential mate far more than they say they do, said study author Madeleine Fugre, a professor of social psychology at Eastern Connecticut State University in Willimantic. 

Previous research on this subject has given conflicting results. Some studies have suggested that both parents and their adult children (especially daughters) may say that personality is more important than looks in a potential mate, with these individuals typically ranking physical attractiveness lower on a list of personality characteristics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hmm interesting, i would like to say however that this topic is in its early stages. Obviously its healthy to be cautious, to knock it at this stage i dont agree with.

 Look at anti depressents. Could you not say by your logic that many people with depression just need to buckle up and get on with life. Im sure people abuse these kinds of drugs as well. Measuring personal struggle is very risky, no one size fits all. PTSD i can imagine be an absolute nightmare for an individual. I would take a guess  a large number of people cannot deal with to much mental struggle. They may use  distraction techniques,  thought supression, abuse of drugs etc etc to get away from pain. How can one measure what is healthy and normal regarding dealing with negative thoughts? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Interesting, i like how you think. It makes me consider things myself which i wouldnt have thought. Yes, i understand ( tounge in cheek)  or im trying to get my head around why would they visit us. A world which i can only guess from outsiders is full of war and violence and negativity. You bring up some very good points, about the threat we could pose to them... eventually. What im speculating here if that an advanced civilisation/ species/ being was indeed to take an interest in us, would they have to take any action? Again im speculating here, but would they not be capable of observing us, in ways that we cannot comprehend? Just like we observe bacteria under a  under a microscope, been ever so busy. 

We are assuming,  not wrongly with our human logic that we  humans are advanced and are capable of causing destruction to other outside species. However maybe going back to your comment on the human capability to self destruct and create chaos is by far an unintelligent way of living in the universe. Maybe alien life forms have tackled selflishness and evil. Concepts to us humans which are indeed self destructive. Maybe these aliens have learnt a lesson, way back in the past, that we as humans  are going to be learning very soon. Maybe along the way these aliens have been busy creating a new way of being, a way of living without evil.

Who knows !! truely speculation of course :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right, thankyou for your explanation. You went into great detail, and i enjoyed your logic of thinking. Yes you raise some valid points regarding distance and probability etc. However im going to ask (and please dont think im picking an argument here) is that we are seeing aliens from the perspective of a thinking human mind. We are going by the logic that aliens need to operate like humans. They have to think like us, and see things the way we do. Can you really believe that another life form, think, and conceptualise like us. One that is possibly far far more advanced than us. Who have evolved way ahead of us? When we see an ant on the floor scurrying around, from what we know they have no sense of the complexity of the world. 

Now lets even say a chimpanzee who  from my understanding are quite intelligent from what we know. Are they aware of the achievements of space travel, the internet ? They dont marvel at are achievements ( not that im aware) Now imaging another life form which could be  way more advanced than us, with an entirely different way of being. A way of being we can not understand. Who are we as humans are to think that are thinking and knowledge ( so far ) has to be a measure of all knowledge across the universe and even far beyond. Who are we to say they dont see us like ants sculling around not even able to comprehend another life entirely?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> At the outset, Lamar Smith, who chairs the committee, made his views clear: the alarmist theories of climatologists had no hard proof, he claimed. 

And anyone who even tried to predict what would happen to the Earths climate by 2100 was not credible.



One commentator suggested the "insane" hearing was a form of gaslighting, with the "cavalcade of falsehoods" designed to make people question their mental health.

Just one renowned climate scientist, Professor Michael Mann, appeared at the hearing, flanked by three academics described as being very much in the minority on the issue.

But one of them, Dr Roger Pielke, a climate science policy writer at Colorado University, clearly disappointed some committee members when he said climate science had consistently shown there was a fundamental risk since the 1980s.

He even advocated imposing a carbon tax on petrol to raise billions for climate-related projects.

That suggestion prompted a telling response from one Republican committee member, Randy Weber, who described it as utter blasphemy.


If every time you publish something you are worried about having to respond to endless FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] requests and receiving thousands of emails and being called to testify, obviously thats very stifling. 

The intention is to cause scientists to retreat. Its meant to send a chilling signal to the entire research community.

That is: if you, too, publish and speak out on the threat of human-caused climate change, we're going to come after you.

He said Republicans had been going after scientists simply because you don't like their publications of their research  not because the science is bad, but because you find the research inconvenient to the special interests who fund your campaigns. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  You mean this, still an interesting read, with the main article

As robots and other computer-assisted technologies take over tasks previously performed by labor, there is increasing concern about the future of jobs and wages. We analyze the effect of the increase in industrial robot usage between 1990 and 2007 on US local labor markets. Using a model in which robots compete against human labor in the production of different tasks, we show that robots may reduce employment and wages, and that the local labor market effects of robots can be estimated by regressing the change in employment and wages on the exposure to robots in each local labor marketdefined from the national penetration of robots into each industry and the local distribution of employment across industries. Using this approach, we estimate large and robust negative effects of robots on employment and wages across commuting zones. We bolster this evidence by showing that the commuting zones most exposed to robots in the post-1990 era do not exhibit any differential trends before 1990. The impact of robots is distinct from the impact of imports from China and Mexico, the decline of routine jobs, offshoring, other types of IT capital, and the total capital stock (in fact, exposure to robots is only weakly correlated with these other variables). According to our estimates, one more robot per thousand workers reduces the employment to population ratio by about 0.18-0.34 percentage points and wages by 0.25-0.5 percent.

<TEXT> Ah, but you missed the hundreds of words before and after the 17 word part you have displayed from the 1000 plus worded article. Including the findings from the report. Let people read the article maybe . It is interesting.  Including this part

"The industry most affected by automation is manufacturing. For every robot per thousand workers, up to six workers lost their jobs and wages fell by as much as three-fourths of a percent, according to a new paper by the economists, Daron Acemoglu of M.I.T. and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University. It appears to be the first study to quantify large, direct, negative effects of robots.

The paper is all the more significant because the researchers, whose work is highly regarded in their field, had been more sanguine about the effect of technology on jobs. In a paper last year, they said it was likely that increased automation would create new, better jobs, so employment and wages would eventually return to their previous levels. Just as cranes replaced dockworkers but created related jobs for engineers and financiers, the theory goes, new technology has created new jobs for software developers and data analysts.

But that paper was a conceptual exercise. The new one uses real-world data  and suggests a more pessimistic future. The researchers said they were surprised to see very little employment increase in other occupations to offset the job losses in manufacturing. That increase could still happen, they said, but for now there are large numbers of people out of work, with no clear path forward  especially blue-collar men without college degrees." </TEXT>

Thats according to the responses from a series of almost 100 Freedom of Information (FOI) requests made in a bid to find out exactly who has the power to snoop on ordinary peoples web browsing histories under the Act.

GCHQ, the Home Office, MI6, the National Crime Agency, the Ministry of Justice, all three armed forces and Police Service of Scotland all failed to respond to the FOI requests  so the total could be much higher. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Humans become heat stressed when the body absorbs more heat than is tolerable. If core body temperature rises just a few degrees above 37, deadly heatstroke can result. By using its cooling system  sweating  the human body can maintain a safe temperature even if air temperatures rise above 37. This mechanism works better in a drier atmosphere (which is why steam rooms feel hotter than saunas  even at the same air temperature). The heat index is a measure that combines this humidity effect with air temperature to provide a feels like temperature. A heat index in excess of about 40.6 is considered dangerous to human health.

<TEXT> The researchers carried out two new genome-wide studies and combined the results with six previous studies in a 'meta-analysis' -- involving in total 12,496 cases of glioma and 18,190 people without.

The size of the study meant it was able to detect 13 previously undiscovered genetic changes that increased the risk of glioma. These were found to affect a variety of cell functions, including nerve cell division, DNA repair, cell cycle control, protein production and inflammation.

Scientists at The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) and their colleagues found that different sets of genes influence a person's risk of developing the two subtypes of glioma - glioblastoma and non-glioblastoma.

<TEXT> Market psychology tells us that people dont know how much they can afford though, even when they think they are working wonders on the stock market. The same bullish attitude creates greed and bubbles. And when a bear market comes about people freak. Stocks going by the subject history matter ( 2008 crash) showed us that people and a hell of alot, dont do what you do. If people were that wise with money and know how money works  why people are in to historic debt at the moment? 

And yes investing in one company is madness. However when a crash happens and your spreaded over several companies and there flying off a cliff with your money, well thats a different story. </TEXT>

"If I invest 10K tomorrow, and the next day that stock crashes to 10% of its previous value then the worth of my stock goes from 10K to 1K. Now I've already spent that 10K, from the moment it is invested it is gone, and even after the crash the amount I've spent is the same. "

Now what would happen if that very same stock you bought decreased by another 20% and then 6 months later by another 15% where would that leave you? and how would you feel about it? </TEXT>

Crashes and downturns dont always last for months. Hence the massive sell offs, where people can not hold onto their negative value stocks. We have plenty of evidence of this through history. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Panic selling yes. Now , how do you know what individual people have as assets and money they can hold onto during a crash , and a depreciation of just one stock value alone to fall in double digits,  which can last years? Can you really tell me that the average person in America has disposable income and no debt, to be able to watch such a downturn?  Fair play to you to be able to ride out this kind of storm if you can. However market psychology shows us that people dont always operate this way. There has been a financial crash very frequently.   Market  go up and so they should come down. They will bubble and then they will pop. And the cycle goes on.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Glad you liked it. Iv just read your source. I like a quote, taken from the book 

It's no accident, I think, that tennis uses the language of life. Advantage, service, fault, break, love, the basic elements of tennis are those of everyday existence, because every match is a life in miniature. Even the structure of tennis, the way the pieces fit inside one another like Russian nesting dolls, mimics the structure of our days. Points become games become sets become tournaments, and it's all so tightly connected that any point can become the turning point. It reminds me of the way seconds become minutes become hours, and any hour can be our finest. Or darkest. It's our choice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The psychology class served as a control group. The two history courses incorporated instruction explicitly designed to cultivate critical thinking skills. For example, students in the history courses were taught how to identify logical fallacies - statements that violate logical arguments, such as non sequiturs.

At the beginning of the semester, students in all three courses took a baseline assessment of their beliefs in pseudoscientific claims. The assessment used a scale from 1 ("I don't believe at all.") to 7 ("I strongly believe.").

Some of the topics in the assessment, such as belief in Atlantis, were later addressed in the "historical frauds" course. Other topics, such as the belief that 9/11 was an "inside job," were never addressed in the course. This allowed the researchers to determine the extent to which changes in student beliefs stemmed from specific facts discussed in class, versus changes in a student's critical thinking skills.

At the end of the semester, students took the pseudoscience assessment again.

The control group students did not change their beliefs - but students in both history courses had lower beliefs in pseudoscience by the end of the semester.

Students in the history course for honors students decreased the most in their pseudoscientific beliefs; on average, student beliefs dropped an entire point on the belief scale for topics covered in class, and by 0.5 points on topics not covered in class. There were similar, but less pronounced, changes in the non-honors course.

"The change we see in these students is important, because beliefs are notoriously hard to change," says McLaughlin. "And seeing students apply critical thinking skills to areas not covered in class is particularly significant and heartening."

"It's also important to note that these results stem from taking only one class," McGill says. "Consistent efforts to teach critical thinking across multiple classes may well have more pronounced effects.

"This drives home the importance of teaching critical thinking, and the essential role that humanities can play in that process," McGill says. "This is something that NC State is actively promoting as part of a universitywide focus on critical thinking development." </TEXT>

Worcester's rate is the second highest in Worcestershire, with only the Wyre Forest faring worse at 26 per cent.

It comes after a child poverty action group hit out over the rising tide of low paid workers, saying it is plunging too many families into problems.

Some city leaders are blaming it on the rise in poorly paid jobs, zero hours contracts and the benefits crackdown. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Climate change is impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating today, Mattis said in written answers to questions posed after the public hearing by Democratic members of the committee. It is appropriate for the Combatant Commands to incorporate drivers of instability that impact the security environment in their areas into their planning.

Mattis has long espoused the position that the armed forces, for a host of reasons, need to cut dependence on fossil fuels and explore renewable energy where it makes sense. He had also, as commander of the U.S. Joint Forces Command in 2010, signed off on the Joint Operating Environment, which lists climate change as one of the security threats the military expected to confront over the next 25 years.

But Mattis written statements to the Senate committee are the first direct signal of his determination to recognize climate change as a member of the Trump administration charged with leading the countrys armed forces.

These remarks and others in the replies to senators could be a fresh indication of divisions or uncertainty within President Donald Trumps administration over how to balance the presidents desire to keep campaign pledges to kill Obama-era climate policies with the need to engage constructively with allies for whom climate has become a vital security issue.

Mattis statements on climate change, for instance, recognize the same body of science that Scott Pruitt, the new Environmental Protection Agency administrator, seems dead-set on rejecting. In a CNBC interview last Thursday, Pruitt rejected established science pointing to carbon dioxide as the main driver of recent global warming.

Mattis position also would appear to clash with some Trump administration budget plans, which, according to documents leaked recently to The Washington Post, include big cuts for the Commerce Departments oceanic and atmospheric research  much of it focused on tracking and understanding climate change.

Even setting aside warming driven by accumulating carbon dioxide, its clear to a host of experts, including Dr. Will Happer, a Princeton physicist interviewed by Trump in January as a potential science adviser, that better monitoring and analysis of extreme conditions like drought is vital.

Mattis statements could hearten world leaders who have urged the Trump administration to remain engaged on addressing global warming. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is scheduled to meet Trump on Friday.

<TEXT> People with ADHD are quick to lose their patience. Several of the participants in the study cited boredom in their previous jobs as a reason for setting up their own company, where they could follow up on their own ideas whenever they wanted. One woman reported that she had introduced 250 new products within just a few years. In situations that would be highly stressful for others, such as difficult meetings with important customers, many of those surveyed felt at ease and stimulated. "Their impulsiveness, resulting from ADHD, gives them the advantage of being able to act under unforeseen circumstances without falling into anxiety and paralysis," says Patzelt.

Most of those surveyed act without thinking, even when making far-reaching decisions. One of the entrepreneurs described buying a friend's company over lunch. He only learned of the friend's plan to retire during the meal. Other participants reported that they make investments with no strategy and commit large sums of money to projects with highly uncertain outcomes. Some entrepreneurs believe that this kind of quick decision making is the only way to be productive, and are willing to live with setbacks as a result. Some have difficulty coping with structured activities.

"A marked willingness to try out new things and take risks is an important entrepreneurial trait," says Patzelt. However, the respondents' impulsive actions led to success only when they focused on activities essential to the development of their businesses. One disadvantage of their impulsiveness was mentioned by all of them: problems with routine tasks such as bookkeeping.

The scientists now want to investigate more closely what the links are between the DNA and social phobia. "In order to achieve this goal, we need many more study participants who suffer from social anxiety," says the psychologist and study coordinator Stefanie Rambau from the Clinic and Policlinic for Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy at University Hospital Bonn. Information about the study is available at http://www.SocialPhobiaResearch.de. "Those who take part will help to research social phobia. This is the basis of better diagnosis and treatment procedures in the future," says Stefanie Rambau. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The polling study is the first in-depth climate change research in multiple European nations and involved interviewing more than 1,000 people in each country, with the results then weighted to be nationally representative.



The citizens gave near identical answers to the question of when the impacts of global warming would be felt, with 60% answering that they were already here. At least two-thirds of them supported their nation being part of the Paris climate deal and they were at least two to one in favour of penalising countries that were not, perhaps via the border carbon taxes proposed by some French politicians.

People see that if there are free riders, that is not a very good thing, said Pidgeon. Earlier in March, the US state department snubbed the UNs climate change chief when she requested a meeting.

Subsidising renewable energy with public money was popular, with 70% support in the UK and Germany, 75% in France, and 87% in Norway. Increasing taxes on fossil fuels was supported in oil- and gas-rich Norway, but opposed two to one in France and Germany. In the UK, people were evenly split over tax hikes for fossil fuels.

Some may find this graph rather interesting of the unusual temperatures over the North pole 8th Match 2017

<TEXT> Childhood cancer survivors are living longer. Now research shows they are also less likely to develop second cancers while still young. The decline followed a sharp drop in the use of radiation therapy for treatment of childhood cancers.

Between the 1970s and the 1990s, the percentage of pediatric cancer patients treated with radiation fell from 77 to 33 percent. The average radiation dose also dropped. Their chance of having second cancers within 15 years of the first fell as well.

The study included 23,603 five-year survivors from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. The survivors were treated at 27 medical centers in the U.S. and Canada. The federally funded study is based at St. Jude. Gregory Armstrong, MD, of the St. Jude Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, heads the study.

"The most ominous late effect of pediatric cancer treatment is a second malignancy," he said. "This study shows efforts to reduce the late effects of treatment are paying off.

"The risk of second cancers for survivors increases with age, so it is good to see the reduction emerging early in survivorship while survivors are still young."

<TEXT>  2nd Paragraph down

The chemicals in question are per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), which are used to make consumer products nonstick, waterproof and stain-resistant. Think carpets, upholstery and weather-resistant clothing. Previous research has found associations between exposures to PFASs and kidney and testicular cancer, low birth weight, thyroid disease, decreased sperm quality, pregnancy-induced hypertension and immunotoxicity in children. The chemicals have become somewhat ubiquitous too, detected worldwide in water, soil, sediment, wildlife and human blood samples. The study that Peaslee co-authored tested hundreds of fast food packaging samples for fluorine, a marker of PFASs, finding the element in about half of paper wrappers and one-fifth of paperboard samples.

<TEXT> Hello, i am wondering is their a psychological tipping point in the minds of people before they start to believe that climate change is really happening? With so much exposure in the news and people still not believing, what has to happen to an individual before reality sets in. Do they, their community has to be affected in order for this to happen?

Iv gone past caring what other's think, if I'm directly not causing them harm. To try and live up to how others expect me to be and live, is in my own opinion dicing with unneeded stress. As long as I'm putting positive thoughts and actions out there and letting go of the consequences helps me a lot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> An article which highlights how packaging on fast food has negative affects on our overall health.

The samples, consisting of paper wrappers, paperboard, and drink containers, were analyzed for a class of chemicals called PFASs (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), also known as PFCs. These highly fluorinated chemicals are widely used in an array of nonstick, stain-resistant, and waterproof products, including carpeting, cookware, outdoor apparel, as well as food packaging. "These chemicals have been linked with numerous health problems, so it's concerning that people are potentially exposed to them in food," says Laurel Schaider, an environmental chemist at Silent Spring Institute and the study's lead author. Exposure to some PFASs has been associated with cancer, thyroid disease, immune suppression, low birth weight, and decreased fertility. "Children are especially at risk for health effects because their developing bodies are more vulnerable to toxic chemicals," says Schaider. Approximately one third of children in the U.S. consume fast food every day. </TEXT>

''Even though pets may not fully understand or respond verbally, the level of disclosure to pets was no less than to siblings," says Cassels. "The fact that pets cannot understand or talk back may even be a benefit as it means they are completely non-judgmental"

Has anyone ever experienced a pet what has talked back? I would like to know... just because.

<TEXT> Rising sea levels, extreme weather such as intense heat waves, flooding, droughts and storms pose increasingly severe risks to Europe's ecosystems, human health and economy, says a new report.

The report 'Climate change, impacts and vulnerability in Europe 2016', from the Copenhagen-based European Environment Agency, assesses the latest trends and projections on climate change and its impacts across Europe, and finds that better and more flexible adaptation strategies, policies and measures will be crucial to lessen these impacts.

Changes in climate are already having wide-ranging impacts on ecosystems, the economy and on human health and well-being in Europe, with new records continuing to be set on global and European temperatures, sea levels and reduced sea ice in the Arctic.

Precipitation patterns are changing, generally making wet regions in Europe wetter and dry regions drier. Glacier volume and snow cover are decreasing.

At the same time, climate-related extremes such as heat waves, heavy precipitation and droughts, are increasing in frequency and intensity in many regions. Improved climate projections provide further evidence that climate-related extremes will increase in many European regions.

<TEXT> Interesting, i wonder how much common this is on Reddit.

Vast legions of malleable Twitter accounts are valuable to both corporations, for whom they can pump up follower counts, and to individuals and organizations interested in flooding Twitter with spam or creating the illusion of a consensus around controversial issues. A small percentage of the bots may have already been sold, they say, as they appear to follow accounts outside of the bot network. As older accounts are more valuable  its hard to trust a Twitter account created two days ago after all  their shadowy master could simply be waiting for his investment to mature. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of the 200,510 women analyzed, 29.5 percent were ages 18 through 25 years and 70.5 percent were ages 26 through 44 years; 5.3 percent (n = 10,587) were pregnant. Among all pregnant women, the prevalence of past-month marijuana use increased from 2.4 percent in 2002 to 3.9 percent in 2014, an increase of 62 percent. The prevalence of past-month marijuana use was highest among those ages 18 to 25 years, reaching 7.5 percent in 2014, significantly higher than among those ages 26 to 44 years (2.1 percent). However, increases over time did not differ by age. Past-year use was higher overall, reaching 11.6 percent in 2014, with similar trends over time. In nonpregnant women, prevalences of past-month use (2014: 9.3 percent) and past-year use (2014: 16 percent) were higher overall, with similar trends over time. Increases over time in past-month marijuana use did not differ by pregnancy status.

 

These results offer an important step toward understanding trends in marijuana use among women of reproductive age. Although the prevalence of past-month use among pregnant women (3.85 percent) is not high, the increases over time and potential adverse consequences of prenatal marijuana exposure suggest further monitoring and research are warranted. To ensure optimal maternal and child health, practitioners should screen and counsel pregnant women and women contemplating pregnancy about prenatal marijuana use, the authors write. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A protein known as FosB in the reward centre of the brain alters in chronically ill people suffering from an addictive disorder (e.g. heroin addiction): it is genetically modified, split off and shortened. This modification under the stimulus of the drug results in the protein being more stable and therefore remaining longer in this part of the brain than in its original form  even as much as several weeks after withdrawal of the drug.  This means that a craving for this stimulus persists. This addictive craving is stored in a sort of "memory" function and, surprisingly, can still be detected after death.

<TEXT> Older people who help and support others are also doing themselves a favor. An international research team has found that grandparents who care for their grandchildren on average live longer than grandparents who do not. The researchers conducted survival analyses of over 500 people aged between 70 and 103 years, drawing on data from the Berlin Aging Study collected between 1990 and 2009.

In contrast to most previous studies on the topic, the researchers deliberately did not include grandparents who were primary or custodial caregivers. Instead, they compared grandparents who provided occasional childcare with grandparents who did not, as well as with older adults who did not have children or grandchildren but who provided care for others in their social network.

Emotional support

The results of their analyses show that this kind of caregiving can have a positive effect on the mortality of the carers. Half of the grandparents who took care of their grandchildren were still alive about ten years after the first interview in 1990. The same applied to participants who did not have grandchildren, but who supported their children -- for example, by helping with housework. In contrast, about half of those who did not help others died within five years.

<TEXT> "If you look at China's per capita consumption-based (environmental) footprint, it is small," says Diana Ivanova, a PhD candidate at Norwegian University of Science and Technology's Industrial Ecology Programme. "They produce a lot of products but they export them. It's different if you put the responsibility for those impacts on the consumer, as opposed to the producer."

That's exactly what Ivanova and her colleagues did when they looked at the environmental impact from a consumer perspective in 43 different countries and 5 rest-of-the-world regions. Their analysis, recently published in the Journal of Industrial Ecology, showed that consumers are responsible for more than 60 per cent of the globe's greenhouse gas emissions, and up to 80 per cent of the world's water use.

"We all like to put the blame on someone else, the government, or businesses," Ivanova says. "But between 60-80 per cent of the impacts on the planet come from household consumption. If we change our consumption habits, this would have a drastic effect on our environmental footprint as well."

The analysis allowed Ivanova and her colleagues to see that consumers are directly responsible for 20 per cent of all carbon impacts, which result from when people drive their cars and heat their homes.

But even more surprising is that four-fifths of the impacts that can be attributed to consumers are not direct impacts, like the fuel we burn when we drive our cars, but are what are called secondary impacts, or the environmental effects from actually producing the goods and products that we buy.

<TEXT> Cancer is most deadly when it has begun to spread as successful treatment is much more difficult. Scientists around the globe are therefore trying to understand how the process occurs and develop new ways to stop it.

Professor Benitah's team found CD36 was present on metastatic cancer cells from patients with a range of different tumours including oral tumours, melanoma skin cancer, ovarian, bladder, lung and breast cancer. To confirm its essential role in cancer spread, they added CD36 to non-metastatic cancer cells which then caused the cells to become metastatic.

<TEXT> "Adolescent binge drinking not only is dangerous to the brain development of teenagers, but also may impact the brains of their children," said senior author Toni R. Pak, PhD, an associate professor in the Department of Cell and Molecular Physiology of Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine.

The study by Dr. Pak, first author Anna Dorothea Asimes, a PhD student in Dr. Pak's lab, and colleagues was presented Nov. 14, 2016 at Neuroscience 2016, the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience.

The study, which was based on an animal model, found that adolescent binge drinking altered the on-off switches of multiple genes in the brains of offspring. When genes are turned on, they instruct cells to make proteins, which ultimately control physical and behavioral traits. The study found that in offspring, genes that normally are turned on were turned off, and vice versa.

Teenage binge drinking is a major health concern in the United States, with 21 percent of teenagers reporting they have done it during the past 30 days. Among drinkers under age 21, more than 90 percent of the alcohol is consumed during binge drinking episodes. Binge drinking is defined as raising the blood alcohol concentration to 0.08 percent, the legal driving limit, within two hours (generally about five drinks for a male and four drinks for a female).

<TEXT> University of California, Berkeley, economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman joined French Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics to tap tax, survey and national accounts data in order to produce a working paper posted today by the National Bureau of Economic Growth that shows:

The average pre-tax income of adults in the bottom 50 percent income share in the U.S. has stagnated since 1980.
The bottom 50 percent's share of income share has collapsed from about 20 percent in 1980 to 12 percent in 2014.
Between the early 1980s and 2014, the average pre-tax income of the top 1 percent of adults rose from $420,000 to about $1.3 million, and their income share increased from about 12 percent.

In 1980, the top 1 percent adults earned on average 27 times more than bottom 50 percent adults, while they earn 81 times more today.

The share of women falls sharply as one moves up the income ladder, with only 11 percent in the top 1 percent today.

There has been close to zero growth for working-age adults in the bottom 50 percent of the distribution since 1980.
In the bottom half of the distribution range, only income for the elderly is rising, while income has fallen for those under the age of 65.

"The top 1 percent income share is now almost twice as large as the bottom 50 percent share, a group that is by definition 50 times more numerous," write Saez, Zucman and Piketty, who are co-directors of the World Wealth and Income Database.

To address the inequities they are documenting through their combination of tax, survey and national account data that captures 100 percent of national income, the economists suggest that officials consider improving education and access to skills, reforming labor market institutions to boost workers' bargaining power, and instituting a higher minimum wage.

<TEXT> Researchers found that nearly 10,000 metric tons -- or 22 million pounds -- of plastic debris enter the Great Lakes every year from the United States and Canada. Matthew Hoffman, assistant professor in RIT's School of Mathematical Sciences, is the lead author of "Inventory and transport of plastic debris in the Laurentian Great Lakes," which will run in an upcoming issue of Marine Pollution Bulletin.

"This study is the first picture of the true scale of plastic pollution in the Great Lakes," Hoffman said. Hoffman used computer simulations to follow the volume of plastic debris moving across state and international boundaries -- from Illinois to Michigan and from Canada to the United States.

Earlier studies estimate 40,000 to 110,000 metric tons of plastics enter the oceans along the U.S. coastline, Hoffman said.

In their study, Hoffman and co-author Eric Hittinger, assistant professor of public policy at RIT, report that half of the plastic pollution entering the Great Lakes -- 5,000 metrics tons per year -- goes into Lake Michigan, followed by Lake Erie with 2,500 metric tons and Lake Ontario with 1,400 metric tons. Lake Huron receives 600 metric tons of plastic and Lake Superior, 32 metric tons per year.

Estimates of surface microplastics entering the lakes each year show 4.41 metric tons in Lake Erie, 1.44 metric tons in Lake Huron and .0211 metric tons in Lake Superior.

<TEXT> Overview 

The study says there is sufficient evidence to suggest marijuana, or cannabis, reduces levels of dopamine in the brain - a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in learning, movement, motivation, emotion, and reward.

Low dopamine levels have been associated with mood changes, fatigue, depression, and lack of motivation; dopamine deficiency is present in a number of neurological conditions, including Parkinson's disease and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Study leader Prof. Oliver Howes, of the Medical Research Council (MRC) Clinical Sciences Center at Imperial College London in the United Kingdom, and team recently published their results in the journal Nature.

According to the 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, there are around 22.2 million marijuana users in the United States, making it the most commonly used illicit drug in the country.

Long-term marijuana use has been linked to a number of mental health conditions, including schizophrenia, anxiety, and depression, but the mechanisms underlying this association have been unclear.

Given the increased legalization of marijuana for medicinal and recreational purposes, researchers are keen to learn more about how the drug affects the brain.

For this latest study, Prof. Howes and team conducted a review of numerous studies investigating how the primary psychoactive compound in marijuana - tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) - affects the brain.

<TEXT> Summary 


Female sexual function is an important component of a woman's sexual health and overall well-being. New research examines the relation between female sexual functioning and changes in relationship status over time.
[couple having sexual problems]
Women in long-term relationships may experience a decrease in sexual desire.
Female sexual functioning is influenced by many factors, from a woman's mental well-being to age, time, and relationship quality.

Studies show that sexual dysfunction is common among women, with approximately 40 million American women reporting sexual disorders.

A large study of American adults between the ages 18-59 suggests that women are more likely to experience sexual dysfunction than men, with a 43 percent and 31 percent likelihood, respectively.

Treatment options for sexual dysfunction in women have been shown to vary in effectiveness, and the causes of female sexual dysfunction still seem to be poorly understood.

New research sheds light on the temporal stability of female sexual functioning by looking at the relationship between various female sexual functions and relationship status over a long period of time.

Studying the link between relationship status and female sexual desire
Previous studies that examined sexual functions in women did not look at temporal stability and possible interactions between different female sexual functions.

But researchers from the University of Turku and bo Akademi University - both in Finland - looked at the evolution of female sexual desire over a period of 7 years.

The new study was led by Ph.D. candidate in psychology Annika Gunst, from the University of Turku, and the results were published in the Psychological Medicine science journal.

Researchers examined 2,173 premenopausal Finnish women from two large-scale data collections, one in 2006 and the other 7 years later, in 2013.

Scientists used the Female Sexual Function Index - a short questionnaire that measures specific areas of sexual functioning in women, such as sexual arousal, orgasm, sexual satisfaction, and the presence of pain during intercourse.

Researchers took into consideration the possible effects of age and relationship duration.

The average age of the participants at the first data collection was 25.5 years. Given that the mean age was quite low and the average age of menopause is much later, at 51 years, the researchers did not think it necessary to account for the possible effects of hormonal changes.

Relationship status influences sexual desire over time
Of the functions examined, women's ability to orgasm was the most stable over the 7-year period, while sexual satisfaction was the most variable.

The ability to have an orgasm improved across all groups during the study, with single women experiencing the greatest improvement.

Women with a new partner had a slightly lower improvement in orgasmic ability than single women, but a higher improvement than women who had been in the same relationship over the 7-year period.

The study found that women who had stayed in the same monogamous relationship over the entire 7-year observation period experienced the greatest decrease in sexual desire.

By contrast, women who had found a new partner over the study duration experienced lower decreases in sexual desire.

Women who were single at the end of the observation period reported stable sexual desire.

According to the researchers, relationship-specific factors or partner-specific factors that have no connection with the duration of the relationship do have an impact on women's sexual functions. Consequently, healthcare professionals should account for partner-specific factors when they treat sexual dysfunction in women.

However, researchers also point out that sexual function needs to be further examined in a short-term study to have a better understanding of the diversity in sexual function variation.

Strengths and limitations of the study
Researchers point out the methodological strengths of the study, as well as its limitations.

Firstly, because the study was longitudinal, it reduced the so-called recall bias, meaning that participants reported their own experience with higher accuracy.

The study also benefited from a large study sample, validated measures, and structural equation modeling, which reduces errors in measurement.

However, the authors note that the long 7-year timeframe may not account for short-term fluctuations, and varying sexual functions may interact differently when studied over a long period of time.

The study did not examine sexual dysfunctions.

Finally, the authors mention that they did not have access to data about cohabitation, or about the duration of singlehood.

<TEXT> BIG DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TYPES OF CONTRACEPTIVES

Hormonal contraceptives, like birth control pills, implantable rods and patches, contain two types of hormones: estrogen, which naturally peaks just before ovulation when naturally cycling women can conceive offspring, and hormones that have the same effect as progesterone, which naturally peaks during the extended sexual phase, a time when offspring cannot be conceived. The levels of each hormone type vary in different contraceptives. Hence, some contraceptives mimic hormones that are more characteristic of ovulation, whereas others mimic hormones when women can't conceive. The women who used contraception with more estrogen were most sexually active when they were in a less committed relationship. On the other hand, women who used contraception with more progesterone were the most sexually active when they were faithful and loyal to their partners.

<TEXT> Dr Griffin suggested that over time, the portrayal of more empowered female characters in more contemporary Disney films could even help influence a generation of young women who will not be willing to be passive and weak in the workplace.

He continued: "Our study highlights the importance of the themes of "work" and "organization" within these films and suggests that through repeated viewing within cinemas, and through DVD, Blu-ray and streaming services they are very likely to contribute towards the development of expectations about working life."

The research team recorded references to work in the 54 classic animated films and noted a five stage sequence of work which frequently recurred.
children are separated from their parents
they are forced to take work which is dangerous, dirty or unfulfilling
their managers manipulate or deceive them
the positive aspects of work are emphasised  they are encouraged to 'whistle while they work'
they are rescued and leave the workplace or in later animations re-define their identity in new roles.

Co-author Mark Learmonth, Professor of Organization Studies at Durham University Business School, said: "In this study we have used Disney as a lens to develop the idea of 'organizational readiness'  that is, children's expectations about work which are shaped by social and cultural forces that indirectly prepare them for experiences of their future organizational life.
"We have argued that Disney can be considered a contributory factor in this process - along with other films, books, computer games, comics, toys and other influences - adding towards a social reality in which children develop an understanding of the world of work."

<TEXT> We as Americans should be embarrassed about Donald Trump, said Michael DeLuise, 66, a retired university vice president and registered Republican who lives in Eugene, Oregon. We as Americans have always been able to look at the wacky leaders of other countries and say, Phew, thats not us. We couldnt if Trump wins. Its like putting P.T. Barnum in charge. And its getting dangerous.

To be sure, the nation is sour on Clinton, too. Only 39 percent of voters have a favorable view of the Democratic nominee, compared to the 56 percent who view her unfavorably. Less than a third say they would be excited or proud should she move into the White House.


Question. Why as Americans would choose to  be voting for leaders who are clearly unfit to run a country, with all the lies been told, what does that say about wanting to be led by dishonesty.In a right mind people wouldnt chose a spouse who was dishonest, so why a president who is running a country?

<TEXT> Is the alternative not to employ more staff at night which caters for their need.Or at least group peoples needs together and then work on implemented strategies to maintain a safe environment 24/7 ? Idealistic i know however drugging people so staff can have an easy shift and everyone gets sleep surely isnt the answer ? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Errr maybe at least give them some kind of appropriate medication? From the article 

 In 2012, 77 per cent of treatments using the drugs were described as excessive and lasting for longer than the recommended six weeks, the report found.
Its shocking that the evidence continues to be flatly ignored George McNamara, Alzheimers Society Older antipsychotics such as haloperidol and chlorpromazine are still being used extensively, with no significant shift towards newer and safer types of drug.
Antipsychotics were originally developed for patients with schizophrenia or psychosis, but they are regularly prescribed off label for people with dementia who are behaving in a challenging way.

Now if care homes are there to look after people 24hrs they need to look after them and try at least to implement standards such as employing more staf at night. Facilitating patients needs so individual patients are in an environment where  specialised care is available for them.Drugging individuals is not the way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey thanks for the reply. First off,  very very impressive is your hotel !! and at the grand old age at 45. I applaud you sir. I like how you remember your friend mentioning that how capable you are. It has stuck with you, and it sounds like your not to arrogant about it. Bonus points for the change from English teaching to the resort. I must say it appears that you want to give something back to the world . Have  you done personality tests/ self assessments  before to figure this out ? ( pm if you need be ) i realise its a personal question so if you dont reply i undestand. Yeah im still admiring the hotel you linked me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This in my opinion is speculating what an article  title should contain and is impossible to understand when posting.The title of this piece is taken from the article itself and hasnt been made up. Its a shame  ( again from my point of view ) that articles and links are taken down when they reach high upvotes and scanned for  unnecessary errors. Regarding the article been Russian and not fitting the requirement ? I know you work hard to moderate comments, however this article generated positive comments and discussion. I would consider the above comments from other users to about this removal  been heavy handed . </TEXT>

Weird question to ask , however do we know for sure that  other animals are not communicating and maybe even trying to communicate with us. A bad comparison to use possibly, but  just because species communicate differently, who are we ( humans )  to rule out that other beings are not communicating  complexly. We just havent figured that out ? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The bosses of Britains largest public companies earned an average of 5.5m last year, and have enjoyed a 10% pay rise while wages in the rest of the economy lag far behind.

Rapid inflation for the countrys best paid executives is being driven by a small, all-male group at the top of the corporate tree, according to the High Pay Centre, which published its annual survey on earnings at FTSE 100 companies on Monday.

There is apparently no end yet in sight for the rise and rise of chief executive pay packages, said the centres director, Stefan Stern. In spite of the occasional flurry from more active shareholders, boards continue to award ever larger amounts of pay to their most senior executives.

Leading company bosses now typically earn 129 times more  including pensions and bonuses  than their employees. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The face, nose and hair looked so much like Trumps that I had to share it with you, explains well-known Martian researcher Scott C Waring on his UFO Sightings Daily blog.
This bizarre sighting now has some alien hunters questioning Trumps real place of birth, as some believe he could be linked to or is a creature not of this world.
Is this a symbol of an alien in the Mars culture that had power and prestige one that cause the people of this planet to feel empowered, enough to make his face permanently in the scenery?


Is this a sign that Trump is an alien, or decided from the aliens on Mars?
Waring explains that the Republicans face is visible with great detail, however some looking at the image may see a jagged rock cloaked in a black shadow.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Country. In 2011, the top carbon dioxide (CO2) emitters were China, the United States, the European Union, India, the Russian Federation, Japan, and Canada. These data include CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion, as well as cement manufacturing and gas flaring.

<TEXT> From the article 

These horrors of climate change are the fault of big nations, such as China and India, and rich ones such as the United States.

President Rodrigo Duterte is now issuing an ultimatum to nations that have been destroying the climate.

You can pay poor countries (like the Philippines) to forego cheap, dirty fossil fuels. Or, he says, our politicians will chuck your United Nations-brokered climate change treaty in the trash.

China, America, Europe, they continued to emit their poisonous fumes in the name of prosperity, Duterte said, according to the Philippine Star. There really is climate change. But who caused it? Not us.

<TEXT> Nope your wrong

At its core, the civil war in Syria is not a religious conflict. The dividing line is ones loyalty to the Assads government. However, some religious communities tend to be more supportive of the regime than the others, fuelling mutual suspicion and religious intolerance in many parts of the country.

ICIJs review of Mossack Fonsecas internal records shows that the Panama-based law firm is a major provider of secrecy to companies involved in extractive industries. The firms internal files include more than 1,400 companies whose names refer to mining, minerals, oil, petrol or gas. Other less explicitly named companies  including the 12 companies allegedly used by Bedjaoui in the Algerian energy deal  also played roles in the extractive sector, the files show.

Twelve of the 17 companies he used were created by Mossack Fonseca in a crossroads of illicit financial flows, according to Italian investigators. Algeria lost an estimated US$1.5 billion annually to tax dodging, bribery, corruption and criminality between 2004 and 2013, according to Global Financial Integrity. </TEXT>

<TEXT> On Wednesday, at a news conference in Florida, Trump said he has never met Russian President Vladimir Putin. "I never met Putin, I don't know who Putin is," he said.

 Last November, he claimed that he "got to know [Putin] very well because we were both on '60 Minutes.'" That made no sense; while the two men were featured the same evening on the CBS newsmagazine show, they were interviewed in different cities and would have had no interaction. But there's more: In 2014, speaking at the National Press Club, Trump said, "I was in Moscow recently and I spoke, indirectly and directly, with President Putin, who could not have been nicer, and we had a tremendous success."

So was he lying last week, when he was trying to deflect criticism of his admiring words for the Russian strongman? Or was he lying two years ago, when he was trying to convince everyone what a big shot he was?

 Also within the week, Trump lied in complaining about the presidential debate schedule and its conflicts with professional football. He told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos, "I got a letter from the NFL saying, 'This is ridiculous. Why are the debates against -- ' because the NFL doesn't want to go against the debates."

 The National Football League responded: "We did not send a letter."

<TEXT>  Trump quotes

Ive got black accountants at Trump Castle and Trump Plaza. Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day . I think the guy is lazy. And its probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. Its not anything they can control.

They should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes. I want to hate these murderers and I always will.

The government contended that Trump Management had refused to rent or negotiate rentals because of race and color, The Times reported. It also charged that the company had required different rental terms and conditions because of race and that it had misrepresented to blacks that apartments were not available.

A presidential candidate who dodged the draft for Vietnam, but who now mocks veterans, and publicly squabbles with the mourning family of a fallen soldier. </TEXT>

Looks good on paper, then he builds it, the sucker costs more than he said, and he runs it into the ground. Everyone loses, except one person: Trump. That's because he got his fees out before the bankruptcy proceedings.Make America Broke Again.

How to solve the USA presidency problem. Go out in the streets and pick randomly , lets say 200 US citizens, interview them and guaranteed you will find much better candidates than the two CLOWNS you got now!!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Trump is making promises he can't keep to poor and desperate people

Americans cannot pay their mortgages because the rich are taking all the wealth out of the US - its nothing to do with immigration, just as that is a lie in the UK too.

There is now $30 TRILLION in off shore tax havens. Most of it is US, UK and EU money. There was not $30 Trillion in tax havens 35 years ago.

You can blame immigrants and globalisation as much as you like, but the reality is that untaxed profits of corporations and the rich taking monies off shore is 3 larger an issue than the banker bankruptcies / Credit Crunch in 2008 (world wide QE since is now $10 Trillion.

There is no way on earth that immigrants and globalisation in the US is taking these sorts of monies out of the economy.

The sad fact is that Trump is blaming immigration and globalisation for the cause of the slump in the US economy - as Brexiteers do in the UK - but it's cack, lies, fantasy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> How do Muslims feel about groups like ISIS?

Recent surveys show that most people in several countries with significant Muslim populations have an unfavorable view of ISIS, including virtually all respondents in Lebanon and 94% in Jordan. Relatively small shares say they see ISIS favorably. In some countries, considerable portions of the population do not offer an opinion about ISIS, including a majority (62%) of Pakistanis.

Favorable views of ISIS are somewhat higher in Nigeria (14%) than most other nations. Among Nigerian Muslims, 20% say they see ISIS favorably (compared with 7% of Nigerian Christians). The Nigerian militant group Boko Haram, which has been conducting a terrorist campaign in the country for years, has sworn allegiance to ISIS.

More generally, Muslims mostly say that suicide bombings and other forms of violence against civilians in the name of Islam are rarely or never justified, including 92% in Indonesia and 91% in Iraq. In the United States, a 2011 survey found that 86% of Muslims say that such tactics are rarely or never justified. An additional 7% say suicide bombings are sometimes justified and 1% say they are often justified in these circumstances.

In a few countries, a quarter or more of Muslims say that these acts of violence are at least sometimes justified, including 40% in the Palestinian territories, 39% in Afghanistan, 29% in Egypt and 26% in Bangladesh.

In many cases, people in countries with large Muslim populations are as concerned as Western nations about the threat of Islamic extremism, and have become increasingly concerned in recent years. About two-thirds of people in Nigeria (68%) and Lebanon (67%) said earlier this year they are very concerned about Islamic extremism in their country, both up significantly since 2013.

<TEXT> Trump is correct that preliminary FBI data show a significant increase in big-city homicides in 2015. But he is extremely incorrect in asserting that decades of progress in reducing the incidence of violent crime have been reversed by the Obama Administration's (unspecified and unsubstantiated) "rollback of criminal enforcement." In fact, violent crime has fallen dramatically since the current president took office.

<TEXT> [W]hen CNNs Jake Tapper confronted Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort with the inconvenient facts about how historically safe most Americans are, Manafort chose to attack the messenger. Which is to say, to attack the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
 
Empirically, according to FBI statistics, crime rates have been going down for decades, Tapper said. How can Republicans make the argument that, somehow, its more dangerous today, when the facts dont back that up?
 
People dont feel safe in their neighborhoods. I dont know what statistics youre talking about, Manafort replied. The FBI is suspect these days, after what they just did with Hillary Clinton.

<TEXT> Sanger and Haberman also pressed Trump for his reaction to last week's failed coup in Turkey. A mutinous faction of the country's military launched a deadly Friday night putsch that was ultimately repelled by forces loyal to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. In the days since, authorities have embarked on an astonishing purge of the state's institutions, leading to the arrest, detention or suspensions of tens of thousands of soldiers, judges, academics, civil servants and others caught in the dragnet of the government's roundup.
"I dont think so," Trump said, responding to a question from the journalists about whether the attempted coup against Erdogan could have been staged, "but I do give great credit to him for turning it around."

US Republican Party presidential nominee Donald Trump has praised Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for his handling of last week's failed coup.

"I give great credit to him for being able to turn that around,"

Asked if Erdogan was exploiting the coup attempt to get rid of his enemies, Trump said "I don't think we have a right to lecture".

<TEXT>   The following are Christian terrorists movements


Lords Resistance Army

Active: 1980s-Present, about 30 years


 
Who are they? The Lords Resistance Army (LRA) is a Christian Fundamentalist terrorist group originally from Uganda, but now active in the Sudan, the Central African Republic, and other places. Uganda, you may remember, is a hotbed of Christian Fundamentalism, so it makes sense that a group who calls themselves Christianist would come from the country. The LRA surfaced in the popular conscious sometime ago when Joesph Kony suddenly became a meme on the internet; up to that point, their main claim to fame is child sex slaves and children soldiers. Indeed, the LRA is known to orchestrate kidnappings, railroading young boys into fighting while forcing young girls into sexual slavery. Those who refused to fight were hacked to pieces. The young girls are forced to be brides for the soldiers, and thus helping to spread HIV. Theyre especially brutal towards civilians, as well, wiping out entire villages and attacking refugee camps.

The goal of the LRA is pretty straight froward: they want a Bible-based state that uses the Ten Commandments as guide posts. Thats something any right-wing politician or Christianist can sympathize with, right?

 Ku Klux Klan

Active: 1860s-Present, 149 years

Who are they? These guys dont need any introduction; every American knows who the Invisible Empire is. The Klan name probably comes from the Ancient Greek  (kuklos), which means circle. Theres a frightening overlap between White Supremacist ideology and Christian terrorism in the Western World, and the Klan is the tip of that iceberg. Thereve actually been three Klans; the first one was formed in 1865, in Pulaski, and drew on former members of the Confederacy Army. They were a vigilante group, and they wore the sheets as a reminder of their fellow Confederates who died (think the classic sheet ghost and youre not far off). Everything about the Klan is geared towards terrorism and psychological war, from the uniform to the cross burning. And while its true the Klan got their start as an arm of the Democratic Party, it was back when the Republicans were Theodore Roosevelt and not Sarah Palin, so I dare you to tell a modern Klansman they voted for Barack Obama.

While the Klan started out hunting down and terrorizing freemen and women, that wasnt their sole target. The Klan is a far right-wing Protestant organization, and being a Protestant organization, they hate Catholics. As a result, Klan has targeted both Catholics and Jews in the (not-so-distant) past. The KKKs history is so violent, in fact, that many draw a comparison between the KKK and Al Qaeda, although I think thats an unfair comparison, as Ill explain below.

National Liberation Front of Tripura

Active: 1989 to present, about 30 years

Who are they? Youve probably heard of the Lords Resistance Army and the KKK, but this is a group that Im pretty sure you havent, unless youre from India. Its easy for us to forget, as Americans, just how big India is; its far more diverse than Europe is, culturally speaking, and its roughly the same size. Its called the worlds largest democracy for a reason, but as the United States shows, no democracy is without its secessionists. And these folks are just some of the many secessionist organizations in India.

According to their manifesto, the NLFT wants  to expand the kingdom of God and Christ in Tripura, and often does so at the point of a gun. They threatened anyone celebrating the Hindu Festival of Durga Puja with death, and are backed by a Baptist Church thats selling them arms. Theyve orchestrated at least two massacres, and used rape as a tool of intimidation. While the Nayanbasi faction has been shut down, the Biswamohan faction has promised to fight on. So here we have a Christian terrorist group spreading their faith in India by sword, metaphorically, and at the point of a gun more prosaically  small wonder we havent heard anything about them in the West, huh?

Antibalaka

Active: 1990s to present, about 25 years

Who are they? Ive cited the Central African Genocide in at least two articles now; these are the militia behind that genocide. Their name means anti-machete in the Sango and Mandja languages, and they first formed to defend Christians and Animists who were on the receiving end of politically motivated violence carried out by Muslims. As these things often do, the tables turned, and now the Antibalaka is doing what right-wingers only wish they could do: ethnically cleanse their country of all Muslims. This includes children, who theyve targeted and murdered in the past. Now, the Antibalaka now stand accused of crimes far worse than anything that Slka, the Muslim rebel group, are guilty of.

Catholic Reaction Force/Protestant Action Force

Active: 1983 till 1994; at least 2002 for other groups using the CRF name; 1970s till 1990s for PAF

Who are they? Really, anytime some claims that Christians arent violent, all you have to do is direct them to Ireland. I could do a whole entry on what happened in North Ireland, beginning in the 1970s. Americans like to pretend that Eire is Guinness, the Blarney Stone, and leprechauns, but during the 1970s, religious violence a la the Thirty Years War was painting the Emerald Isle ruby red. The Irish call this time period The Troubles, and thats an understatement if there ever was one.

The Provisional IRA is perhaps the best known terrorist agency from the period and would definitely earn their spot on this list, if I werent aiming for more obscure groups, but the Catholic Reaction Force and Protestant Action Force were also active and, in the case of the latter, also responsible for a large number of murders. For those who are unfamiliar with the Troubles, it occurred in North Ireland and, as so many European conflicts do, pitted Protestants against Catholics in unmitigated bloodshed. The CRF was behind the Darkley killings, in addition to several mailed bombings in the early 2000s. The PAF, which was far more effective in their killings, has a rap sheet a mile long. You can find it on the Wikipedia page, here.

The Orange Volunteers

Active: Early 1970s to Present, about 40 years

Who are they: Were staying in Ireland for this next group. Fans of science fiction probably remember the Orange Catholic Bible from Frank Herberts Dune, but may never have understood why that name was so subversive, or why it was similar to Herberts other Coca-Pepsi religious hybrids like Zensunni. Orange is the color of Protestantism in Ireland, and green is the color of Catholicism; when you wear green on St. Pattys Day, youre proclaiming your Catholic heritage. The Orange Volunteers, then, are a Protestant terrorist organization.

The OV are Protestant Fundamentalist, and responsible for a number of violent attacks in North Ireland. While the police have been cracking down on the group, the group is still considered to be active and is still terrorizing Catholic citizens and hitting soft targets.

 The Aryan Nations

Active: Unknown, to the Present

Who are they?  The Aryan Nations is an umbrella agency that nets a large number of White and Christian Supremacist agencies ranging from certain breeds of Neo-Nazi to the KKK itself. Its heyday was in the 1980s and the 1990s, when various White Nationalist groups would convene at the groups Idaho compound for their annual congress.

The Aryan Nations got their start in the Christian Identity movement, but has since fractured into no fewer than three factions, with one faction even looking to buddy-buddy with Al-Qaeda in 2005. The Phineas Priesthood is another branch, and theyve made headlines here on AATTP before. The last faction is the Aryan Nation Revival, which holds to their Christian Identity heritage like small-town Conservatives cling to their guns and Bibles.

 The Christian Identity Movement

Active: 1920/1930s to Present, about 95 years

Who are they? When youre dealing with White Nationalism and White Supremacy in the United States, its turtles all the way down, but you can almost certainly find God at the top of the heap. Thats what the Christian Identity Movement is; its not necessarily an organization so much as it is a loose affiliation of organizations like the Aryan Nations.

The Christian Identity Movement is a very weird movement; they actually have hostile relations with Evangelicals and other charismatic Protestants  not because theyre racist bigots, no; its because the CIM is Post-Millennial, where the vast majority of Evangelicals are Pre-Millennial. This distinction is lost on anyone who hasnt studied the Scofield-Derby Heresies, but the basic idea is that the Tribulation has already occurred and the goal is to build up the world to the second coming. Their theology is just as skewed, though; for instance, members of the CIM believe that non-Caucasians dont have souls, and therefore, cant be saved.

<TEXT> Obama spoke with Erdogan by phone Tuesday and pledged any needed assistance to the Turkish government in the wake of last weeks attempted coup, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters in Washington. Even so, Obama made clear the U.S. expects that any inquiry should be conducted consistent with the democratic values of the Turkish constitution, he said while declining to answer whether the U.S. is concerned that the response wont respect those democratic values.
Those are the values that the Turkish people were defending in repelling the coup, Earnest said. One good piece of evidence of that is you promptly saw all parties of the Turkish parliament condemning the attempted coup -- even parties who have vigorous political disagreements with the Turkish government.
Keep up with the race of a lifetime.

The coup attempt led by a faction of Turkeys military the night of July 15 has tested relations between the U.S. and Turkey, which is a NATO ally and important partner in the fight against Islamic State extremists in Syria and Iraq. Erdogan has demanded that the U.S. extradite or deport a reclusive Turkish cleric, Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania and whom he blames for inciting the rebellion. Erdogan and Gulen are onetime allies who are now political opponents.

Extradition Steps

During their call, Obama and Erdogan discussed Gulens status, Earnest said. Separately, he said, the Turkish government on Tuesday submitted information related to the cleric that the U.S. government is reviewing. He said it was too early to say whether the documents represent a formal extradition request.
Earnest said any decision on Gulen would be made according to steps established by U.S. law and not by Obama. If a formal request is received, the U.S. would consider it on its merits and make a decision based on whether it thinks it relates to crimes covered by the extradition treaty between the U.S. and Turkey and on whether theres evidence that crimes were committed.

<TEXT> Boris Johnson was embarrassingly forced onto the back foot during his first London press conference as foreign secretary on Tuesday as he was repeatedly pressed to explain his past outright lies and insults about world leaders, including describing the president of the United States as part Kenyan and hypocritical.

Standing alongside John Kerry, the US secretary of state, Johnson claimed his remarks had been misconstrued, that his past journalism had been taken out of context, and world leaders he had met since his appointment fully understood his past remarks.

Johnson was holding a press conference designed to showcase the continuing closeness of the UK-US special relationship in the wake of Brexit, as well as the joint commitment to finding a solution to the crisis in Syria.

Johnson twice referred to the crisis in Egypt, but was believed to be referring to Turkey. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Plenty from the following countries

Britain The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said he had spoken to his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, to underline support for Turkeys democratic elected government and institutions in the wake of the overnight coup attempt.

The Foreign Office is advising Britons in Turkey to stay indoors, avoid public places  especially demonstrations  and remain vigilant.

It says: The situation now appears quieter in Istanbul, and the bridges across the Bosphorus are reopening. But there are reports of tank fire and small arms fire in Ankara.

British Airways says it is canceling all flights to and from Turkey on Saturday, but easyJet says it plans to runs its scheduled flights, largely to Turkish resort towns. The budget airline says the schedule will be kept under continuous review.
Natos chief says all alliance personnel and military units in Turkey are safe and secure following the attempted coup.
Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said in a Twitter post that he had spoken to Natos supreme commander, US Army Gen Curtis M Scapparrotti, who confirms that all Nato personnel and units in Turkey are safe and secure.

The alliance chief also tweeted that he welcomed the strong support shown by the people and all political parties to democracy and to the democratically elected government of Turkey.
Spains acting foreign minister, Jose Manuel Garcia Margallo, condemned the attempted coup, telling Spanish national television that his government completely supports the Turkish government headed by President Erdogan.

He said: Without a doubt we support respecting the constitution and democratically elected institutions, and we condemn all coups without reservation.
Garcia Margallo spoke by telephone from Mongolia, where he is attending the ASEM Asia-Europe Meeting.
Syrian opposition The exiled Syrian opposition congratulated the Turkish people for halting the attempted military coup.
The Turkey-based Syrian National Coalition said Turkey has protected its democratic institutions in the face of dark and desperate attempts that sought to take control of the popular will.
It says the Turkish people value democracy and will not let a group of putschists take it away in a desperate attempt to restore military rule.

Turkey has been one of the main backers of the uprising against the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, and is hosting 2.7 million Syrian refugees.
In the early hours of the attempted coup, celebratory gunfire broke out across Damascus. The government and its supporters view the rebels as terrorists and consider Turkey to be one of their chief sponsors.

Hamas The Islamic militant group Hamas has congratulated Erdogan for quashing a vicious plot to overthrow him.
The Turkish leader has been a staunch supporter of Hamas and a fierce critic of Israel. Hamas says it remembers Turkeys wise leadership in supporting the Palestinian people and their cause and working to lift the blockade on Gaza, the coastal territory ruled by the group.

Hamas supporters took to the streets in several places across the Gaza Strip to celebrate the failure of the coup, raising Turkish flags and posters bearing Erdogans image.
Turkey recently restored ties with Israel after a six-year lull following a deadly Israeli naval raid to stop an activist flotilla aiming to breach the Gaza blockade.

Qatar The Gulf nation of Qatar, which has close ties to Erdogans government, was quick to condemn the military coup attempt.
It called the attempted coup a violation of the constitutional legitimacy in Turkey and said it supports all legal measures the government takes to maintain security and stability.

The official Qatar News Agency said the ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, has spoken with Erdogan by phone to express Qatars support.

Qatar and Turkey have grown increasingly close in recent years, and share similar stances on their support for Syrian rebel groups and the Muslim Brotherhood. The two countries agreed last year to establish a Turkish military base in Qatar.
Iran said the attempted military coup in Turkey was doomed to fail.

The foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, was quoted by the official IRNA news agency as praising the brave defence by the people of Turkey of their democracy and elected government.
He said the events in neighbouring Turkey prove that coup dtat has no place and is doomed to fail in our region.

Pakistan An aide to prime minister Nawaz Sharif condemned the attempted coup in a statement and said Pakistan hopes that peace and normalcy will be restored in Turkey.
Tariq Fatimi also said he had contacted Turkeys foreign minister to express solidarity with Turkeys government and democratic institutions.

Pakistans main political parties have also praised the people of Turkey for foiling the coup.
Sharif was himself overthrown in a 1999 coup led by Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who ruled Pakistan until 2008.
Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani expressed support for Turkeys elected government, saying in a statement that democratic elections are the most effective means for peaceful transfer of power.

Militaristic options will only undermine democratic institutions, stability and development in the country, the statement from Ghanis office said.
Azerbaijan The president of Turkeys neighbor Azerbaijan condemned the attempted coup.

President Ilham Aliev was concerned about developments in Turkey and welcomed measures taken to prevent the attempt at a coup and to stabilise the situation, spokesman Ali Hasanov said.

Azerbaijan is a Turkic nation and its late president Geidar Aliev once described their relations as one nation, two states  a phrase later echoed by TErdogan. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The former UK Independence Party leader was hosting a live phone-in show on LBC radio on Sunday when a caller named Richard phoned in, appearing to agree with Mr Farage's views on integration, especially that foreigners in Britain were not learning English.

Richard coaxed Mr Farage by saying: "I don't see how you can integrate if you don't speak the language of the country, you know?"

Mr Farage wholeheartedly agreed with Richard, saying learning the language was "absolutely fundamental".

Richard then interjected with the crux of his question.

"I was wondering why you've spent more than 20 years living in Belgium and yet you don't speak a word of Flemish, German or French?"

"How do you know that?" Mr Farage asked.

Richard continued to question him on his linguistic capabilities.

"I'll have you know Richard I am very good with a French wine list ... I know my way around a menu," Mr Farage said.

After failing to confirm that he could speak any of Belgium's official languages of Dutch, French and German, he conceded defeat.

"I'm not a brilliant linguist, I'll admit to it," Mr Farage said. </TEXT>

NOAA and NASA are particularly concerned about the warming of Earths polar regions. The climate of these areas, scientists argue, affects climates thousands of miles away.
Sea ice in the Arctic Sea and the Greenland ice sheet have melted unusually early this year.
The state of the climate so far this year gives us much cause for alarm, Carlson warned.

<TEXT> Updated article 

There are conflicting reports about whether a former Turkish air force commander has confessed to planning Friday's attempted military coup.
At least 232 people died and 1,400 were wounded in the ensuing violence, and there have been mass arrests.
The state-run Anadolu news agency quoted Gen Akin Ozturk as telling interrogators he had "acted with intention to stage a coup".
But two private broadcasters said the general had denied playing a role.

NTV quoted him as saying: "I am not someone who has planned or directed the coup attempt... I don't know who did."
Anadolu said he was one of 112 generals and admirals who had been detained. Fifty had been remanded in custody pending trial, it added.

 " An unknown assailant shot the deputy mayor of Istanbul's Sisli district in the head on Monday and he was in a critical condition, Turkish broadcaster NTV reported.

It was not immediately clear whether the incident was linked to Friday's abortive military coup in which more than 200 people were killed. Turkey remains in a state of high tension, though the government says it has the situation fully under control.

NTV reported that the assailant had entered the office of deputy mayor Cemil Candas and then gun shots were heard. Turkey's main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) runs the prosperous Sisli district. Along with other opposition parties the CHP has condemned the attempted coup "

<TEXT> According to Mujtahid, Turkish intelligence agencies have received information about some negative collaboration between bin Salman and bin Zayed, but the Saudis have managed to convince the Justice and Development party to rest assured and be optimistic about Riyadh's measures.

He revealed that bin Salman has been trying to convince the Turks to conceal the UAE's role in the coup and has promised a large amount of cash in reprisal.

An attempted Turkish military coup appeared to crumble on Saturday after crowds answered President Erdogan's call to take to the streets to support him and dozens of rebel soldiers abandoned their tanks in the main city of Istanbul.

In relevant remarks on Sunday Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif voiced regret that certain countries, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, were somehow interested in the victory of coup plotters against the legal government of President Erdogan in Turkey.



"Our foreign minister told a closed session of the parliament today that certain states like Saudi Arabia and Qatar didnt dislike the strengthening of the coup in Turkey, an issue which requires further contemplation," member of the parliament's Presiding Board Akbar Ranjbarzadeh quoted Zarif as saying on Sunday.

Meantime, another MP Gholamreza Jafarzadeh quoted Zarif as saying, "Given the Saudis' stance on issues in Turkey, we conclude that Saudi Arabia has likely been involved in this coup."

<TEXT> So all these countries  authorities which condemmed the coup are in on it being staged? I dont think so somehow.

Britain The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said he had spoken to his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, to underline support for Turkeys democratic elected government and institutions in the wake of the overnight coup attempt.

The Foreign Office is advising Britons in Turkey to stay indoors, avoid public places  especially demonstrations  and remain vigilant.

It says: The situation now appears quieter in Istanbul, and the bridges across the Bosphorus are reopening. But there are reports of tank fire and small arms fire in Ankara.

British Airways says it is canceling all flights to and from Turkey on Saturday, but easyJet says it plans to runs its scheduled flights, largely to Turkish resort towns. The budget airline says the schedule will be kept under continuous review.

Natos chief says all alliance personnel and military units in Turkey are safe and secure following the attempted coup.

Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said in a Twitter post that he had spoken to Natos supreme commander, US Army Gen Curtis M Scapparrotti, who confirms that all Nato personnel and units in Turkey are safe and secure.
The alliance chief also tweeted that he welcomed the strong support shown by the people and all political parties to democracy and to the democratically elected government of Turkey.

Spains acting foreign minister, Jose Manuel Garcia Margallo, condemned the attempted coup, telling Spanish national television that his government completely supports the Turkish government headed by President Erdogan.
He said: Without a doubt we support respecting the constitution and democratically elected institutions, and we condemn all coups without reservation.

Garcia Margallo spoke by telephone from Mongolia, where he is attending the ASEM Asia-Europe Meeting.
Syrian opposition The exiled Syrian opposition congratulated the Turkish people for halting the attempted military coup.

The Turkey-based Syrian National Coalition said Turkey has protected its democratic institutions in the face of dark and desperate attempts that sought to take control of the popular will.
It says the Turkish people value democracy and will not let a group of putschists take it away in a desperate attempt to restore military rule.

Turkey has been one of the main backers of the uprising against the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, and is hosting 2.7 million Syrian refugees.

In the early hours of the attempted coup, celebratory gunfire broke out across Damascus. The government and its supporters view the rebels as terrorists and consider Turkey to be one of their chief sponsors.

Hamas The Islamic militant group Hamas has congratulated Erdogan for quashing a vicious plot to overthrow him.
The Turkish leader has been a staunch supporter of Hamas and a fierce critic of Israel. Hamas says it remembers Turkeys wise leadership in supporting the Palestinian people and their cause and working to lift the blockade on Gaza, the coastal territory ruled by the group.

Hamas supporters took to the streets in several places across the Gaza Strip to celebrate the failure of the coup, raising Turkish flags and posters bearing Erdogans image.

Turkey recently restored ties with Israel after a six-year lull following a deadly Israeli naval raid to stop an activist flotilla aiming to breach the Gaza blockade.

Qatar The Gulf nation of Qatar, which has close ties to Erdogans government, was quick to condemn the military coup attempt.

It called the attempted coup a violation of the constitutional legitimacy in Turkey and said it supports all legal measures the government takes to maintain security and stability.

The official Qatar News Agency said the ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, has spoken with Erdogan by phone to express Qatars support.

Qatar and Turkey have grown increasingly close in recent years, and share similar stances on their support for Syrian rebel groups and the Muslim Brotherhood. The two countries agreed last year to establish a Turkish military base in Qatar.

Iran said the attempted military coup in Turkey was doomed to fail.

The foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, was quoted by the official IRNA news agency as praising the brave defence by the people of Turkey of their democracy and elected government.
He said the events in neighbouring Turkey prove that coup dtat has no place and is doomed to fail in our region.

Pakistan An aide to prime minister Nawaz Sharif condemned the attempted coup in a statement and said Pakistan hopes that peace and normalcy will be restored in Turkey.

Tariq Fatimi also said he had contacted Turkeys foreign minister to express solidarity with Turkeys government and democratic institutions.
Pakistans main political parties have also praised the people of Turkey for foiling the coup.

Sharif was himself overthrown in a 1999 coup led by Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who ruled Pakistan until 2008.
Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani expressed support for Turkeys elected government, saying in a statement that democratic elections are the most effective means for peaceful transfer of power.

Militaristic options will only undermine democratic institutions, stability and development in the country, the statement from Ghanis office said.

Azerbaijan The president of Turkeys neighbor Azerbaijan condemned the attempted coup.
President Ilham Aliev was concerned about developments in Turkey and welcomed measures taken to prevent the attempt at a coup and to stabilise the situation, spokesman Ali Hasanov said.

Azerbaijan is a Turkic nation and its late president Geidar Aliev once described their relations as one nation, two states  a phrase later echoed by TErdogan. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Strange why would Turkeys four main parties all condemn the coup if it was staged ? 

Turkey's four main political parties condemned the attempted military coup in a joint statement on Saturday, marking a rare departure from usually fractious politics.
 
The four parties, which run the gamut from the right-wing, Islamist-rooted AK Party founded by President Tayyip Erdogan to the left-of-center, pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), said their stance was invaluable for democracy in Turkey.
 
The statement was read aloud in the assemby the parliamentary speaker

<TEXT> Heres a round-up of global reaction to the failed coup in Turkey:

Britain
The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said he had spoken to his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, to underline support for Turkeys democratic elected government and institutions in the wake of the overnight coup attempt.

The Foreign Office is advising Britons in Turkey to stay indoors, avoid public places  especially demonstrations  and remain vigilant.

It says: The situation now appears quieter in Istanbul, and the bridges across the Bosphorus are reopening. But there are reports of tank fire and small arms fire in Ankara.

British Airways says it is canceling all flights to and from Turkey on Saturday, but easyJet says it plans to runs its scheduled flights, largely to Turkish resort towns. The budget airline says the schedule will be kept under continuous review.



Natos chief says all alliance personnel and military units in Turkey are safe and secure following the attempted coup.

Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said in a Twitter post that he had spoken to Natos supreme commander, US Army Gen Curtis M Scapparrotti, who confirms that all Nato personnel and units in Turkey are safe and secure.

The alliance chief also tweeted that he welcomed the strong support shown by the people and all political parties to democracy and to the democratically elected government of Turkey.



Spains acting foreign minister, Jose Manuel Garcia Margallo, condemned the attempted coup, telling Spanish national television that his government completely supports the Turkish government headed by President Erdogan.

He said: Without a doubt we support respecting the constitution and democratically elected institutions, and we condemn all coups without reservation.

Garcia Margallo spoke by telephone from Mongolia, where he is attending the ASEM Asia-Europe Meeting.

Syrian opposition
The exiled Syrian opposition congratulated the Turkish people for halting the attempted military coup.

The Turkey-based Syrian National Coalition said Turkey has protected its democratic institutions in the face of dark and desperate attempts that sought to take control of the popular will.

It says the Turkish people value democracy and will not let a group of putschists take it away in a desperate attempt to restore military rule.

Turkey has been one of the main backers of the uprising against the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, and is hosting 2.7 million Syrian refugees.

In the early hours of the attempted coup, celebratory gunfire broke out across Damascus. The government and its supporters view the rebels as terrorists and consider Turkey to be one of their chief sponsors.

Hamas
The Islamic militant group Hamas has congratulated Erdogan for quashing a vicious plot to overthrow him.

The Turkish leader has been a staunch supporter of Hamas and a fierce critic of Israel. Hamas says it remembers Turkeys wise leadership in supporting the Palestinian people and their cause and working to lift the blockade on Gaza, the coastal territory ruled by the group.

Hamas supporters took to the streets in several places across the Gaza Strip to celebrate the failure of the coup, raising Turkish flags and posters bearing Erdogans image.

Turkey recently restored ties with Israel after a six-year lull following a deadly Israeli naval raid to stop an activist flotilla aiming to breach the Gaza blockade.

Qatar
The Gulf nation of Qatar, which has close ties to Erdogans government, was quick to condemn the military coup attempt.

It called the attempted coup a violation of the constitutional legitimacy in Turkey and said it supports all legal measures the government takes to maintain security and stability.

<TEXT> Two Turkish majors, a captain and five privates have requested asylum in Greece after landing in a military helicopter. Greeces defense ministry has said a Blackhawk helicopter carrying seven Turkish military personnel and one civilian landed in the city of Alexandroupolis earlier Saturday. The passengers asked for asylum and were arrested for illegal entry into Greece.

Eight Turkish military personnel who sought asylum in the northern Greek town of Alexandoupolis have removed all insignia from their uniforms, making it impossible to know their ranks. 


We are in the process of sending interpreters in order to be debriefed, one insider said. We are also in touch with the Turkish embassy. It is vital that we know what is going on.

Another said it was highly unlikely that the eight men would be granted asylum.

Turkey and Greece, though Nato partners, are long-time adversaries, with Athens closely watching events in Ankara.

As such, a defence expert said, this was the first time a Turkish military asset had landed in Greece with a view to seeking asylum in the country.

The land borders between the neighbours have been reinforced but customs officials are clarifying that while the crossing between Greece and Turkey remains open (even if cross-border traffic has been reduced to a trickle), that between Turkey and Greece remains firmly closed.

<TEXT> Fethullah Glen: who is the man blamed by Turkey's president for coup attempt?

The accusation by Turkeys president, Recep Tayyip Erdoan, that US-based cleric Fethullah Glen is behind Friday nights attempted coup is part of a familiar rhetoric and a long-running rivalry. So is there any truth in it?

It is probably worth pointing out in the first instance that the traditional rivalry in Turkish society has been between secularists (including those in the army) who look to the modern states founder, Kemal Atatrk, and Islamists  not least Erdogans AKP party.

The AKP has itself provoked a number of coups or attempts in Turkish history. And in many respects, Friday night looked to be another event in that tradition: a military coup driven from within Turkeys armed forces. By Saturday morning Erdoan had reasserted power and it was announced dozens of senior colonels and generals had been removed.

The military has long seen itself as the guardian of modern Turkey, and the movement lead by Glen occupies a sort of murky gap between the two sides, secularist and Islamist.

Glen, a cleric living in reclusive exile in Pennsylvania, leads a popular movement called Hizmet. It is a hodge-podge that at times has appeared cultish  spawning thinktanks, businesses, schools and publications across the globe, while building up substantial wealth and influence in the process.

Action taken to reinstate constitutional order, human rights and freedoms, say armed forces
 Read more
According to some reports, 10% of the Turkish population is estimated to support Hizmet.

The centre of growing tension in recent years between the Glenists, Erdoan and the AKP has been Erdoans blaming of Glenists in the police and judiciary for anti-corruption allegations in 2013 that targeted senior supporters of the president, including his son Bilal.

The allegations were seen as retaliation for Erdoans moves against Glenist schools as the president attempted to limit the growth of the movement (an effort that had also seen Erdoan invite Glen to return from exile to Turkey).

The rivalry culminated in a purge of perceived Glenists including senior army and police officers, as well as those in the media accused of Glenist links.

As the coup attempt unfolded on Friday night, a lawyer for the Turkish government, Robert Amsterdam, said there were indications of direct involvement of the Glenists, adding that he and his firm had attempted repeatedly to warn the US government of the threat posed by Glen and his movement. Amsterdam cited Turkish intelligence sources in claiming that there are signs that Glen is working closely with certain members of military leadership against the elected civilian government.

The Alliance for Shared Values, the US arm of Glens Hizmet movement, was quick to deny any involvement in the coup, calling such claims highly irresponsible and insisting that the group did not support the military intervention.

<TEXT> The Turkish military says it has taken over after Turkey's PM said a military faction had been involved in an attempted coup.

Prime minister Binali Yildirim has called for calm, saying security forces are doing what is necessary to resolve the situation.

Turkish broadcaster NTV is showing footage of tanks at the entrance to Istanbul's Ataturk airport. 

Military vehicles are blocking two bridges in Istanbul, while military jets have been heard flying over the Turkish capital, Ankara. 

Some media reports have said ambulances were seen in front of Turkey's military headquarters.

Mr Yildirim has warned that those responsible for this "illegal attempt " will pay the "highest price."

 And by the way, the Muslim religion is passed down from the father. If your father was a Muslim, you become one by default in accordance with the religion. And if this guy wanted to disavow himself from Islam, he would have been murdered. Because that is what Islam does: it commands those who leave the Muslim faith to be murdered.
 So yeah, he was a Muslim. Not a strict practicing one, but still a Muslim.

<TEXT> Interesting, thanks for the input .Yes its all down to what works , maybe. However the question we need to be asking does it work?

Is society heading in the right direction , why is there so much hate around at the moment ( racism) , people piled high in debt , etc etc.Obviously iv just highlighted two negative scenarios in the current society ( from my perspective ) . As you say we are stronger as a group and individuals do die off who distance themselves to much from that group.However i do feel that most scientific and social  advancements need a mind so individual, which sees what others can  not see  to have major advancements. History is full of these individuals.Now that mind may be criticised and suppressed, however it is down to individual will to push that belief/idea which is been squashed by the group.

That idea as so often throughout history  has made people wonder and think and changed themselves and others for the better.  

Of course there are bad examples as well of these individuals who promote hate, division and greed for their own selfish reasons.We should be cautious of that and question.I feel what we need is a respect and balance for individual thought which promotes news ways of thinking , which indeed may be against the norm of society.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The motive of most of these deaths is still unknown*. When the police investigate them, the investigations soon get bogged down and are obstructed by corrupt officials. Impunity is, more than ever, at the centre of a vicious circle of violence against media personnel and journalisms chronic depreciation.

The circumstances of these murders are usually very similar. The victims are often radio hosts or local correspondents based in regions far from major cities who cover crime, corruption or sensitive social issues. They are gunned down by sicarios (hit-men) near their home or workplace and in some cases they had been warned in advance about their reporting.

If there is any room for doubt, the police and judicial authorities quickly rule out any connection between the murder and the victims work as a journalist. They often try to cast doubt on the quality of the victims journalism and even go so far as to suggest that the victim was linked to local criminal groups.

<TEXT> Barack Obama on Thursday said US police departments needed to move more quickly to reform.

The US president offered condolences to the family of the black motorist, who was killed by a Minnesota cop, and insisted the country had seen "tragedies like this too many times".

Citing a litany of evidence to show that non-white Americans are more likely to be pulled over, searched or shot by police, Mr Obama appealed to white Americans not to see this as a fringe issue.

This is not just a black issue. It's not just a Hispanic issue. This is an American issue that we should all care about," Mr Obama said in a hastily arranged statement on arrival in Warsaw for a Nato summit.

"All fair minded people should be concerned.

"It's incumbent on all of us to say we can do better than this. We are better than this."

The use of force by police against African-Americans in cities from Ferguson, Missouri, to Baltimore and New York has sparked periodic and sometimes violent protests in the past two years, and has spawned a movement called Black Lives Matter. Anger has intensified when the officers involved in such incidents have been acquitted or not charged at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  yes, I have. I accept that it's your interpretation and that of the authors of the article, but you've failed (either through disinterest or incapability) to indicate where the claim is justified in the Chilcot report. Perhaps you struggle with basic comprehension? Do you think that "presented with a certainty that was not justified" means the same as "deliberately exaggerated", yes or no?


Its a 2 million plus report which has took 7 years to bring together by various professional people.The claim of the "deliberately exaggerated" is presented in the report and  the above articles.Now if you have a comprehensive report which you can show with as much detail  which proves otherwise , then show it here.If not keep on believing in Tony Blair and have a great day.

<TEXT> The Iraqi man who was filmed attacking Saddam Hussein's statue with a sledgehammer when U.S. troops stormed into Baghdad in 2003 said Iraq was in a better shape under his rule and George W. Bush and Tony Blair should be put on trial "for ruining" it.

Kadhim Hassan al-Jabouri was speaking on Wednesday as British former civil servant John Chilcot released a long-awaited report criticizing Britain's role in the U.S.-led invasion and occupation of Iraq.

The report said that "policy on Iraq was made on the basis of flawed intelligence and assessments", and that claims that Iraq posed a threat by possessing weapons of mass destruction were "presented with unjustified certainty".

It said that the turmoil unleashed in Iraq since the invasion should have come as no surprise.

"I regret striking the statue," said Jabouri, a Shi'ite who lost more than a dozen relatives under Saddam, a member of the Sunni Muslim minority. He said they were killed for opposing the Iraqi leader, who was hanged in 2006.

The 12-metre statue of Saddam was pulled down by U.S. Marines shortly after Jabouri and other Iraqis attacked it on April 9, 2003. Images of it being ripped from its plinth were broadcast live around the world and came to symbolize the overthrow of Saddam's ruthless quarter-century in power.

"I wish Saddam would return; he executed many of my family but he is still better than these politicians and clerics who got Iraq to the way it is," he said, referring to the Shi'ite religious political parties that took over after the invasion.

Jabouri, 58, owned a motorcycle repair shop in the Karrada district of central Baghdad at the time of the invasion.

The mainly Shi'ite neighborhood was hit by a huge truck bomb on Saturday night, claimed by the ultra-hardline Sunni group Islamic State, which killed about 250 people. It was the highest toll from a single bombing in more than a decade of chaos following the war which toppled Saddam.

Blair and Bush "must be put to trial as they have ruined Iraq with their lies. It turned out there were no weapons of mass destruction," Jabouri said.

"A DREAM COME TRUE"

Others who suffered under Saddam had a different view and several said they were grateful to the governments in Washington and London for putting an end to his rule.

"Overthrowing Saddam's regime was a dream that came true thanks to the U.S. and Britain and all those who say otherwise are liars," said former political prisoner Faris Mohammed, 46, who was serving a life sentence in the southern Shi'ite city of Basra when the invasion took place.

But Abu Yasser, 67, a retired marketing manager at Iraqi Airways and a member of Iraq's Sunni community, said Chilcot's report offered little comfort to Iraqis marking the start of the Eid al-Fitr religious holiday on Wednesday, overshadowed once again by the violence which has plagued Iraq since 2003.

"Their investigation will not change our situation, it will not restore our Iraq and the people who are gone," he said. "The war came and then the sectarian violence ... and Daesh," he added, referring to Islamic State fighters who seized most of the country's Sunni territories in 2014 and still control the northern city of Mosul.

"Now even the joy of Eid was taken from us in the bombing of Karrada," Abu Yasser said.

Abdul Illah Risan, the Appeal Court General Prosecutor in Baghdad, said he rejected the Chilcot report as "it questions the legality of the war to depose Saddam."

"Yes it is true that the war to oust the dictator has cost the Iraqi people a lot," he said.

"But Iraqis feel grateful to all the coalition countries, and at the top are the United State and Great Britain because they simply gave Iraqis what they wished for and what they were deprived of since birth - which is freedom and democracy.

http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2016/07/06/world/middleeast/06reuters-britain-iraq-inquiry-statue.html?smid=re-share

-This is the reason why George W Bush is the only ex president in modern history who cannot leave his own Country. Because if he did he would be arrested for war crimes. Carter, Clinton and others have been free to travel the world after leaving office, Bush knows he can't and that's why he stays at home where he will be safe.

And Tony Bliar - he's the man that has never visited any orphans in Iraq or given them any of his money but gets given an award from his Best Mates at 'Save' the Children. That sentence is an indictment by itself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And its all  run for profit and greed.Millions died as a result of the war and there is still ongoing terrorism and war because of it. At best, if Saddam was still alive killing people we'd be about break even... maybe.
Blair should take his ill-gotten millions and disappear in shame from all public life, he won't though. His narcissism won't let him.

We illegally invaded and occupied Iraq to gain control of strategic resources such as oil. General John Abizaid, former commander of CENTCOM with responsibility for Iraq said, of course its about oil, we cant really deny that, while Secretary of Defence Chuck Hagel said this in 2007: People say we're not fighting for oil. Of course we are. To round it off, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan added in his 2007 book: I am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows: the Iraq war is largely about oil.

The report, no doubt, will talk about "mistakes" and "things we could have done differently". All of this ignores the fact that, because we weren't in Iraq for humanitarian reasons, things simply couldn't have gone differently.

People often like to say that the initial invasion and toppling of Saddam Hussein was good, but the aftermath - the occupation - was bad. This ignores the fact that they came as part of a package: we overthrew Saddam so that we could occupy the country, gain control of its resources, dismantle its state structure and privatise it.

<TEXT> Iraqis bear the scars of 2003 but they are still bleeding, as grimly illustrated by the bombings last weekend that killed 165 in Baghdad. The Iraqi prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, backed by the US, presides over the fight against Isis, which occupies Mosul, the countrys second city, as well as swaths of neighbouring Syria. Abadis majority Shia community is in the ascendant while Sunnis are marginalised. Low oil prices, rampant corruption and abysmal public services fuel discontent. Kurds in the north, the big winners of the US-led invasion, enjoy autonomy. Iranian influence has grown. Even if few mourn Saddam Hussein, Operation Iraqi Freedom sounds like a misnomer.Iraq study estimates war-related deaths at 461,000

<TEXT> It will be interesting to see the comments coming up in this thread regarding how all of  Islam spreads terror.Watch the circlejerk of  racism and hate spread. This is what the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, wants.

This is precisely what ISIS was aiming for  to provoke communities to commit actions against Muslims, The moments after a terrorist attack are often filled with acts of reprisal. In the six months after the Charlie Hebdo attacks in January, anti-Muslim violence and mosque vandalism more than quadrupled compared with the same period in 2014

Extremist groups feed off of alienation, some counterterrorism experts say, and Islamist militants deliberately aim to make Muslims in the West feel isolated and turn against their own communities.

http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/03/what-isis-really-wants/384980/

The far majority of victims in this war are Muslims,  as  well as every victim is white, black, asian, across all the world . Note how terrorism spread rapidly after 9/11, and the Iraq war (A war which is questionable at best) as well as attacks against the West. As well as the current refugee crisis. Remember hate fuels the flames of ISIS. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Straight from a Hollywood script , nothing but propaganda to get young men out there glamorising war. While the far more intelligent individuals direct  men thousands of miles away from the battelfield so they get them to have blood on their hands.

Example

More U.S. Troops Died by Suicide Than in Afghanistan Combat in 2012.According to the Associated Press, suicides among active-duty troops reached a new high last year.The suicide rate has been rising since 2001.And last year, 349 service members took their lives, much more than the 295 killed in combat in Afghanistan.The suicide figures are tentative, pending completion of pathology reports later this year.

We saw it 20 years ago in the first Gulf War.We even in some ways saw it after Vietnam.I mean, the issues of medical health, of personal stress, of family stress, in fact, go up after the actual fighting has stopped and the soldiers redeploy, theyre back in garrison, because the force is still under a lot of stress.

And we find now, in fact, that the military is about to get into this phase of downsizing.Probably 100,000 or so Army soldiers and Marines will be leaving the military.There are going to be budget cuts.And all these things are putting great burden on the leadership and great burden on the soldiers on the front lines.

And that accumulates and builds, and it ends up that you have got that group that, in fact, will have  will commit suicide as their expression of that stress.

The IS gunmen fled in panic allowing the SAS soldier to carry the injured men to safety." Before eating a Big Mac whilst showing off his glistening six pack and his shinny white teeth"

Remember. In war the heroes always outnumber the soldiers ten to one.

<TEXT>  And none of those countries have large Muslim populations, America has a Muslim population of 1% and Europe 6% so by your stats they are committing a disproportionate amount of attacks. if Europe and America import a sizable Muslim population, terrorism will become the norm.
 Here is just the list from the last 2 years, notice how virtually all attacks are in the name of Islam.

But ( your sources)  reiterates your point that Muslims are the victims in a vast majority of attacks.If you can prove me otherwise than go ahead.Now going by that logic, if the couple of billion Muslim as stated here on this sub are supporters of terrorism/are terrorists there would be a hell of alot more attacks.The problem needs to be solved by Muslims themselves.Not by Westerners creating wars in the Middle East and also people fuelling the fire of hate.ISIS loves this and when racism grows towards Muslims.Well lets say that ISIS number one recruitment tool.Fanning the flames is an understatement. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some facts 

 According to the FBI, 94% of terrorist attacks carried out in the United States from 1980 to 2005 have been by non-Muslims. This means that an American terrorist suspect is over nine times more likely to be a non-Muslim than a Muslim. According to this same report, there were more Jewish acts of terrorism in the United States than Islamic, yet when was the last time we heard about the threat of Jewish terrorism in the media? For the same exact reasons that we cannot blame the entire religion of Judaism or Christianity for the violent actions of those carrying out crimes under the names of these religions, we have absolutely no justifiable grounds to blame Muslims for terrorism.

https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/terrorism-2002-2005

Non-Muslims make up the majority of terrorists in Europe: There have been over one thousand terrorist attacks in Europe in the past five years. Take a guess at what percent of those terrorists were Muslim. Wrong, now guess again. Its less than 2%.

http://thinkprogress.org/world/2015/01/08/3609796/islamist-terrorism-europe/

There have been 140,000 terror attacks committed worldwide since 1970. Even if Muslims carried out all of these attacks (which is an absurd assumption given the fact mentioned in my first point), those terrorists would represent less than 0.00009 percent of all Muslims. To put things into perspective, this means that you are more likely to be struck by lightening in your lifetime than a Muslim is likely to commit a terrorist attack during that same timespan.

http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/

If you are scared of Muslims then you should also be scared of household furniture and toddlers: A study carried out by the University of North Carolina showed that less than 0.0002% of Americans killed since 9/11 were killed by Muslims. (Ironically, this study was done in Chapel Hill: the same place where a Caucasian non-Muslim killed three innocent Muslims as the mainstream media brushed this terrorist attack off as a parking dispute). Based on these numbers, and those of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the average American is more likely to be crushed to death by their couch or television than they are to be killed by a Muslim. As a matter of fact, Americans were more likely to be killed by a toddler in 2013 than they were by a so-called Muslim terrorist.

<TEXT> Pure speculation.You are aware of the current events folding now right?

Standard Lifes decision to close redemptions on its open-ended property fund is vitally important and shows just how precarious the situation is right now.

This seems to have precipitated some pretty big selling in property stocks and asset managers, with Legal   General and Aberdeen Asset Management suffering nasty falls this morning. Barratt Developments and Taylor Wimpey are down 5% again.

Investors are getting very nervous now as they fear Standard Life may not be the only fund that will close its doors. The last time we saw this kind of action was in the financial crisis.

<TEXT> Brexit's effect on the economy is undoubtedly going to be huge. If predictions are right households are going to defer consumption, and more and more firms will delay investment. That, in turn will lower demand for labour and push up unemployment. Britain is going to slip into recession and things are going to get very messy very fast.

The logic is simple  when people are worried about the state of their finances, they stop spending, and when people stop spending, that can signal serious problems on a macroeconomic scale. </TEXT>

As for Trump why would people support a guy who believes in taking a countries resources thousands and thousands of miles away? Are his supporters ignorant or do they believe in taking something which isnt theirs?

Take back the oil. We take over the oil which we should have done in the first place.  And what I would do with the money that we make, which would be tremendous, I would take care of the families of the soldiers that were killed, the families of the soldiers, the wounded warriors that I see. I love them.

What about the Iraqis thats their oil?

<TEXT> Alfred de Zayas was speaking following reports, based on leaked documents, that suggest the European Commission may treat a trade deal with Canada as an EU-only matter that will be discussed in secret and wont require ratification from member states parliaments.

The stated aim of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) is to improve trading relations between the EU and Canada.

But de Zayas said that in the view of vocal opposition from civil society, a thorough, open discussion should be carried out by national parliaments and referenda should be organised in all countries concerned.




Trade deals negotiated in secret, excluding key stakeholders such as labour unions, consumer associations, health professionals environmental experts and now parliamentarians have zero democratic legitimacy, he stated.

He highlighted that a 2014 European Commission consultation on a similar trade deal with the US, known as TTIP, resulted in 97% of respondents from across Europe opposing a clause relating to investment protection.

The provision would enable companies to sue governments over legislation they claim may affect future profits, including safety regulations, workers rights and environmental protections, in a corporate court.

The same would apply to CETA, but no consultation was ever held, de Zayas pointed out.

He also stressed that both the TTIP and CETA should only be ratified after human rights, health and environmental impact assessments have been conducted.

Disputes with countries like France and opposition from civil society organisations have significantly impeded the ratification of TTIP.

UK campaign group Global Justice Now said today the UK would have to redouble efforts to fight deals like the TTIP following the countrys vote to leave the European Union. In the wake of the Leave vote, the UK is now excluded from participation in the trade agreement.

GJNs director, Nick Dearden, warned that the UK government had pushed for the most extreme version of TTIP in European negotiations, and may look to secure deals with even more controversial provisions now the country is out on its own.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The official Leave campaign had suggested that money saved from contribution to the European Union could be spent on the NHS instead.

Mr Farage was not part of the official Leave campaign and had no involvement with their ads he said.

The pledge was featured on buses, fliers and posters and was central to Vote Leave.

Captions such as "Let's give our NHS the 350 million the EU takes every week" and "We send the EU 350 million a week, let's fund our NHS instead" were stamped on Vote Leave campaign material. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Where are the studies you mention?

Here is one interesting study

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3217592/

3. CHARACTERISTICS OF INTERNET ADDICTS
Shek et al. [15] examined Internet addiction behavior in 6,121 Chinese primary and secondary students in Hong Kong and found that one-fifth of their sample could be regarded as Internet addicted. Fu and his colleagues [16] found that 6.7% of the Hong Kong teenagers display five or more symptoms of Internet addiction. In addition, the Internet addiction symptoms seem to go along with individuals' suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms. The situation in China is also quite serious. About 13.7% of adolescent Internet users (about 10 million teenagers) could be classified as Internet addicts [17]. The situation in Taiwan is also similar. Lin and Tsai [18] found that 11.8% of the senior secondary school students in their Taiwan study could be regarded as Internet dependents. Research also indicated that 4.0% to 8.1% of the university students showed excessive or pathological Internet use [19, 20].

The symptoms of Internet addiction or Pathological Internet Use include obsessive thoughts about the Internet, tolerance, diminished impulse control, inability to cease using the Internet, and withdrawal [5, page 187]. Beard and Wolf [21] have also proposed a set of diagnostic criteria for Internet addiction. The characteristics of Internet addicts are described below, with references to previous empirical studies.

3.1. Excessive Use of Internet

Internet addicts spend almost more than triple the number of hours in Internet use than non-Internet addicts [4]. Young also found that the average number of hours per week using Internet by Internet dependents was 38.5 hours, while the nondependents spent only an average of 4.90 hours [22]. According to a survey by Hong Kong Youths Association in 2005 [23], young people of ages 10 to 29 spent an average of 18.4 hours per week in Internet use. About one tenth (9.9%) of the sample spent 42 hours per week, that is, an average of six hours per day on line. In some sense, Internet use is the most important or salient activity in the addicts' daily life, and they usually stay on line longer than they originally expected.

3.2. Obsessive Thoughts about the Internet

The addict is preoccupied with the Internet (thinks about previous online activity or anticipates next online session) [21, page 379] and is unable to refrain from thinking about the Internet most of the time when he or she is awake.

3.3. Pleasant Feeling in Internet Use

People have a lot fun by using Internet. The Internet exposures of the Internet addicts appear to be pleasurable, entertaining, interactive, and relaxed [24, 25]. Overall speaking, the addicts enjoyed the Internet experiences, and the enjoyment and pleasure would drive them to be addicted to Internet use.

3.4. Tolerance

The tolerance symptom refers to the needs to use the Internet with increased amount of time in order to achieve satisfaction [21, page 379]. This symptom is closely related to the excessive use or overuse of the Internet by the addicts.

3.5. Diminished Impulse Control

The diminished impulse control is related to the reduced emotional self-regulation to control one's impulses to reach a goal. In other words, the addicts tend to lose their control of their behavior. In particular, they are unable to cut back or stop Internet use.

3.6. Withdrawal

The withdrawal symptom of the addicts refers to the unpleasant feeling (restless, moody, depressed, or irritable) when the Internet activity is being stopped or cut down.

3.7. Impact on Daily Life

The impact on the daily life and study of the Internet addicts is usually negative [24]. The addicts may sometimes risk the loss of a significant relationship, educational or career opportunity because of the Internet. They may lie to others because of their overinvolvement with the Internet, and they also use Internet as a means to escape from problems or to settle one's unpleasant emotion such as helplessness, anxiety, guilt, or shame [21, page 379].

3.8. Parental and Family Interactions

Internet addicts spent less time with their parents and other family members and tended to have tension with them [22].

3.9. Friendship and Romantic Relationships

Internet addicts tend to have less friends and romantic relationships [26]. They are more lonely and solitary.

3.10. Health Problems

Internet addicts are less healthy than nonaddicts, and they are also less willing to seek medical treatment and less motivated to develop stress-relieving practices [26].

3.11. Academic Performance

Chang and Law [27] found that academic performance is negatively related to Internet addiction score.

3.12. Lonely Character

Morahan-Martin and Schumacher [28] found that loneliness is associated with increased Internet use. The average weekly hours on line of the lonely people was significantly higher than that of the nonlonely people. Lonely people used the Internet when they felt lonely, depressed, or anxious. They were more likely to make and interact with online friends, and to use the Internet for emotional support [28, page 669]. </TEXT>
