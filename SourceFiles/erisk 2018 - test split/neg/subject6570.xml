<TEXT> Yes, I know there's several films in which light harms the so-called ghosts. But I don't think you guys understand. This was not a person in bad make up... That...thing was made of shadow, it was massive, tall to the ceiling! And that smile that went outwards from its own body. I don't know what's going on, but this for sure is not so cheap horror movie.

 About moving, I certainly can't. You have no idea the prices of apartments in Hong Kong. I paid for a year in this place and that was almost all my savings. We're talking about the city with the highest land prices in the world. What you pay here for a tiny cubicle would get you a penthouse in the US. I can't afford moving! And yet...I dare not go back to my apartment here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Part 1](https://redd.it/6a0w2s)

 Okay, Im back. The photoshoot was okay. I was distracted and I think I didnt do my best work today, but its the best I could do under the circumstances. I havent slept in 20 hours, but I found a hotel where I can rest and think what will I do tomorrow. Im not going back home. Not tonight. Not after what happened last night.

 So, after the whole alley thing, we walked to the nearest MTR, and parted ways. I was exhausted and just wanted to get into bed. My apartment in Hong Kong is tiny, as any place in Hong Kong is. Being one of the most expensive cities in the world when it comes to housing, I had low expectations. Luckily I found a clean place, renovated a few years ago and that I could afford. The apartment is one living room the size of an american bathroom, a tiny hole in the wall (hard to call it room) with a bed, another room with a kitchenette and a fridge, and the smallest bathroom I had ever seen. Still, it served its purpose. I didnt plan on staying indoors much, I wanted to explore and enjoy the city as much as I could.
 
 I arrived home, carefully placed my gear in the living rooms table and went straight to bed. All the neons outside had died for the day, so the apartment was pitch black. I fell asleep right away.

 I dont think I had slept much when something woke me up. I cant say if it was a noise or a breeze or what, but I found myself suddenly awake. I kept my eyes closed, and tried to get back to sleep. That turned out to be impossible. I was freaking exhausted but couldnt sleep. There was something that didnt feel right... That feeling when someone is watching you crept into me as I lay on my side, facing my living room and my windows, with my eyes still tightly closed. I knew it was from all the ghost talk earlier that night, it must have affected me more than I thought. As the grown man I am, I opened my eyes to assure myself everything was fine and get the slumber I so badly needed.
 
 And there was nothing there. The living room was empty, and the windows were shut. Case closed.

 But just as I closed my eyes again I realized there seemed to be a big shadow in the corner of my living room that didnt quite belong there. I instantly opened my eyes again and looked straight into it. It was a shadow of some kind, but I was not sure what was casting it. Something from outside? From another building? Luckily the switch to my bedroom light was close to me, so I turned out the lights without leaving my bed. The shadow disappeared, but I could swear it disappeared a fraction of a second too late. It was still visible when the lights first flashed. I could swear it was...but it was late and I was half asleep. There was no one there, the shadow must have been cast from outside. Lights out and back to try and get some sleep.

 But the feeling didnt go away. It kept nagging at me. I still felt...watched. I felt...not alone? Im not sure how to describe it. I wanted to turn around and turn my back to my living room, change position to order my body to go back to sleep I felt unable to. For some reason I didnt want to turn my back to my living room. But at the same time, I didnt want to open my eyes, I was sure there was nothing there! I didnt think the ghost talk could affect me this way. I didnt even believe in all that crap! To prove myself I was being stupid I opened my eyes, but I didnt move. The lights were off, the living room was dark...and still I could see perfectly a shadow in the corner. It was a tall shadow. Almost 8 feet tall Id say. The top was close to the ceiling. I could see no shape. It was just...a tall shadow. I stared into it, trying to see...well, anything! I kept staring at it and I could swear at one point it shuffled a bit to the right, away from the window and closer to my bedroom. Only one inch, but it was enough to make me shiver. I kept staring. I had to make sense of what that was.

 It moved again. Just an inch, but this time towards the centre of the living room. Again, closer to my bedroom. My hand dashed from under the blankets and turned on the light. It was gone again. This time I could swear it stayed longer after I had turned the light on. Like when you look at something very bright and you see it in the corner of your eyes burning through for a few moments.
 Was it still there? I kept looking. Was it gone? Did the light scare it? Or was it simply invisible? Was it shuffling closer towards me now that I couldnt see it? All this and a hundred more thoughts rushed through my head, and against my better judgement, I closed the lights again.

 And there it was. It had moved to the centre of the living room. Now it was halfway from the corner where it was standing earlier, to my bed. Standing perfectly still. A blurted shadow without any recognizable features and yet I knew it was facing me. I could feel it looking at me directly. It had no eyes, and yet I could feel its stare. I wanted to talk, to shout, to ask it what it wanted. But something inside me didnt want to give it that power. The power of acknowledging it as something real. I wondered if I was hallucinating somehow, one of those sleep paralysis episodes I saw in that weird documentary. But I could move. I was not sleeping. This was happening. There was something in my living room, and it was trying to get close to where I was.

 As I kept watching it from my bed it took one step closer towards me. This time I saw it clear, it didnt shuffle, it took one very clear step, with one very clear shadowy foot towards me. I shrank back into my bed, against the wall and I froze there. I was unable to think, unable to move. I know I should have bolted right there right that moment, but I simply couldnt move. My body didnt respond. 

 For a while it didnt move again and nothing changed. I have no idea how long did I spend looking at that nothingness of darkness in my living room, but suddenly I started seeing something on the top part of the shadow (its head??). Something looked less...shadowy? Like it was being broken or cracked. And the crack started getting wider, so very slowly. But I could see it growing horizontally. When it was halfway within the borders of the shadow, it grew wider. And thats when I saw it. It was not a crack. It was a smile. That..thing was smiling. Slowly I started to see teeth, an impossible amount of teeth as the smile kept growing inside the shadow. I didnt even blink for I dont know how long. I started shaking uncontrollably as that thing smiled at me. Or to me. The smile grew outside the borders of the shadow, stretching it out with it.

 Then it took one step closer.

 I couldnt take it anymore. I screamed at the top of my lungs and ran out of the apartment, trying to stay out of its way and smashing the door behind me. I dont remember how I went down 14 sets of stairs, but I found myself three blocks away from my apartment and still running. When I stopped I noticed I had grabbed a backpack from besides my bed. My travelling instinct I guess, my backpack always comes with me. Even when I dont think... And thats the one strike of luck I had that night, because it was my bag from the morning before, from the beach, so it had a set of clothes and shoes. Then I realized I was barefoot and was running around the city at the break of dawn in shorts and nothing else.

 I looked around to make sure that thing didnt follow me. It was nowhere to be seen...but again, the street lights were on, so even if it followed me, I had no way of knowing. I put my shoes on and kept walking until my legs stopped shaking. I ended up in a McDonald's in Jordan, the one in Nathan Street, just behind Temple Street.

 I havent turned off any light in my hotel room yet. Im not sure I will tonight.

 I will have to go back to my apartment eventually. All my stuff is there, and I paid a whole year already. I cant afford another place. I dont know what to do.

 I will call Sam in the morning, but Im not sure what to tell him.

 What can I do? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Its 4AM and Im in a 24 hour Mcdonalds near Temple Street. I had to flee from home an hour ago and my legs are still shaking. I had to write this. I have to make sense of it. I need to feel that Im not insane. It all began with a question, a question that opened some kind of door, that attracted...something. Something thats after me. Something that wont leave me alone...

 But let me start from the beginning. Or give you some background to the whole thing so you can understand. I am in my mid-forties, and a year ago my wife asked me for a divorce. Out of the blue. I knew we had problems, but I never thought there was anything else to it than age. With the passing of years, relationships change, and you get distant. I thought that was it. Apparently not. So four months later I found myself looking for an apartment in Bangor. An apartment for one, for the first time since I was 18. It was a dark time for me. I cant say Im proud of many of the things I did and said, specially in front of my two daughters.

 Anyways, a week before I was supposed to move to the one bedroom I was sure I would loathe, I decided to follow the one dream Ive had since I was a teenager and left the country. I am a photographer, and Ive done my share of traveling, but mostly as family holidays or work assignments. I have always wanted to go to a place where I knew no one, where I had no idea of the local culture of language, and take the best pictures I have ever taken.
 So in one week I planned as much as I could and I moved to Hong Kong. My one crazy move in life. I thought Hong Kong would be different enough to everything I have seen, and visually appealing for my pictures. 

The fact that english was the second language there also helped me decide. I have never been good with languages. I grew up with Bruce Lee movies, so why not? My daughters were finishing college and they understood, they wanted me to pursue my dream. Luckily I didnt fuck them up as much as other things in my life.

 I have been here for more than six months, and I have to say Im in love with the city and its people. its unbelievable. Skyscrapers and neons, then you turn a corner and you are in a tiny buddhist temple dedicated to the goddess of the sea, a place that seems unmoving since the 18th century. Then you have Mongkok, the busiest place on earth. Shops, restaurants, lights, thousands of people bustling around 24/7, small hidden bars with local bands playing heavy metal, old grannies selling food on the streets... You name it. Hong Kong has it.
 
 I have taken more pictures in these months than I have taken in the last 10 years. Yes. I didnt plan on leaving soon. 

That was until tonight. Until the question that began it all.

 Last night I was meeting Sam, one of the few local friends I have managed to make. Sam is also a photographer, and was kind enough to show me around the city when I first arrived (thank you online forums for lost travelers!), take me to some of his favorite photography spots, and even hook me up with a couple of jobs with local models. Last night we got together to take some pictures of Temple Street, one of the most popular night markets in the city. Everyday at 6pm, the market comes alive in a set of tiny streets with buildings that look 200 years old. Flocks of tourists spend hours walking around looking for souvenirs, trinkets and counterfeit products to bring back home. Its old, its colorful, and around midnight it suddenly becomes deserted, and with the neons shining in the nearby corners the lighting is just fantastic.

 Since Sam is the one person I have known the longer here, I usually bombard him with questions about the city and its culture. And he does the same with me, although Im not sure what to respond half of the time. Hes a couple of years younger than me, and although hes never left the country, his english is almost perfect. We sat at a bar after dinner and we were talking about urban legends as the third beer came in. I had no idea people in such a modern city could be so superstitious, most of their urban legends are pretty specific about time and places, and almost all of them are about ghosts. It seems Hong Kong people believe in ghosts and entities that live around them. They even have a whole month in which all spirits roam free and you have to burn food and paper money for them to leave you alone.
 
 At one point Sam looked at me and out of the blue asked Have you ever heard a ghost laugh?

At first I didnt know what to answer. I mean, was he serious? Was this grown man asking me if I had ever heard a ghost laugh? Did Casper count? I tried my best not to offend him by laughing, so I simply replied No...I dont think I have?

 I was relieved when he laughed. But not so relieved when he explained: he told me he had been born with a thing they called the ying-yang eye (and no, thats not the title of a kung fu movie, nor was he amused when I said so). Apparently the ying yang eye allows you to see ghosts. He said he inherited it from his grandmother, and saw many ghosts when he was a child. He doesnt see as many today because hes older and apparently that affects it.
 There were rules too! If you see an umbrella laying on the street, dont take it because it may contain a ghost. Dont ever let a ghost know where you live or youll be allowing it entrance to your life. Dont eat anything you find on the street (as if!) because thats food for hungry spirits and they will follow you everywhere. And a few more I cant even recall. Now I wish I had paid more attention...

 Now, here I had a grown man who I thought was my friend, telling me he saw ghosts. I paused. I had to think very carefully what to say. I didnt want to offend him, but I felt as if he was making fun of me. Was I supposed to believe him? I took a deep breath and told him I was sorry, but I didnt believe in ghosts and leprechauns. And I couldnt see how he could.

 He smiled, as one smiles patiently to a child, and told me he wasnt expecting me to believe him. But still, asked me to play along, because there was a point to the question. He explained that just last week, he was taking pictures around this area and came close to a dark alley, a cul-de-sac, and had a strange feeling. He decided it was best to walk away, to leave that bad feeling behind but as soon as he turned around, he heard...laughter. He paused and looked at me. Was he expecting me to reply? Before I could say anything, he continued. The laughter was not human as he explained it. He said it didnt feel right, only hearing it made his hair stand outright and start sweating. He didnt even dare looking back, he just ran away from it. Still now, a week later, he dreams of the alley every single night.

 I didnt understand. Was there some drunk guy in the alley laughing his ass off? Did he hear someone from a nearby window cracking at a joke from tv? There was no reason to be scared of that. I mean, he didnt see anything! He was just being superstitious over nothing! Yet, I nodded and kept silent.

 He didnt buy it though, he knew I didnt believe him. He kept going. He explained the worst part was not hearing a ghost, he had heard them before. Many times. Seen them too. There was a time when he saw half a head emerge from his kitchen floor! The trick was not to let them know you see them. Never to interact with them. If they notice you can see them, they will latch onto you and bring you bad luck, disease, and god knows what. So, the worst part was not hearing it. The worst part, he said, was that ghosts dont laugh. A ghost is a person who died and left something behind, something undone, or a stubbornness to give up life. But they are not alive anymore, so they cant change the world around them, they cant even see other ghosts. Imagine that. Imagine being surrounded by people, by everyone you ever loved, but they keep going about their lives, ignoring you. Spirits see everyone they love move on, forget them, while the dead cant make themselves known to the living. Oh, they try. They talk, they scream, they shout and they try to break things. But nothing happens. The world is done with them. They cant touch. They cant be seen or heard. They dont exist in this world anymore. 

So, if they dont find a way back to wherever they have to go, spirits start to get angry. They envy what everybody else around them have. Life. Touch. Warmth. They cant have it! Never again! They get enraged, and slowly, over time, spirits become vengeful, and that anger may let them interact with parts of the world. Move objects, latch into the living to suck their energy...but nothing will change what they are, and they can go on like that for centuries.
 So, imagine, creatures of pure hate that despise everything around them. They have forgotten what joy is. They dont know anything else but hate and loathe for the living. So ask yourself this...why would a ghost laugh?

 I have to admit that at this point I was bewitched by what he was telling me. The folklore was so strangely specific that it drew me in like a good movie. But then Sam stopped, finished his beer and looked at me. It was my time to reply. But all I could tell him was that it was a good story. But that was all, a story. I finished my beer and instead of following upon the subject I suggested we went out, took a couple of last shots and call it a night. I could see it was not the answer he was hoping for, but he followed me.
 
 It was almost 2am, we were walking through the shady part of Mongkok when he brought up the subject again. He wanted to know what was my take on that. At that point I was exhausted and half drunk, so I didnt keep anything in. I told him I couldnt believe a grown man like himself could be seriously talking about ghosts. I told him I was sorry if he thought I was being disrespectful, but it was all either a joke, or his imagination. In any case, I expected him to drop the subject. I have to admit I might have been a little less delicate than I remember it now, but it was all I could do.
  He stood silent for a moment and nodded. One last place to shoot and we call it a night.. Finally, the whole thing was over. Or so I thought.

 After a very uncomfortable ten minute walk through dark streets with dying neons, he stopped and pointed into an alley. Tell me you dont feel anything weird about this place. I looked into a small cul-de-sac with no lights, a small dumpster against a wall, and a couple of old posters in serious state of decay. Was he shitting me? He brought me to the ghost alley? He was still going on about it??
 There I just exploded. I thought we had left the whole thing behind, but here he was, bringing me to the goddamn ghost alley. I walked into the alley and stood there See? Theres nothing here! Nothing!! I hid behind the dumpster and boomed a fake laugh Did it sound something like this? A homeless laughing his ass off at you!? And probably shouted a couple more things I am not proud of. I wish I could only blame the beers, but I guess my personal situation has made me more of an asshole than I would like.

 Sam looked pale and insisted that I came out of the alley. And for a second, I could swear I felt...uncomfortable. I had the urge to step away from the alley, as if someone behind me was going to come up at me and...I dont know what. But my stubbornness was stronger than that sudden feeling of terror. I stayed put.

Sam kept insisting I come out immediately. He shouted at me to get back, but he didnt move an inch into the alley. I stood my ground and said I wouldnt leave until he accepted he was being stupid. I guess at this point the beer and my cultural idiocracy took the worst of me. Sam looked down to the ground for what it seemed an eternity, and when he looked up again he was angry. I thought he was gonna come at me, punch the hell out of me. But instead, he screamed my full name, and then a bunch of cantonese I didnt understand. I was ready to punch the guy if he was to come at me, I didnt even think I was antagonizing one of my only friends here by being kind of a jackass. But instead of that, Sam breathed deeply and smiled awkwardly. He told me I was right, he was being stupid and was sorry. Just like that, it was all over. 

 I stepped out of the alley and apologized. I just started realizing how insensitive I was being towards a man whose culture I knew nothing about. I tried to elaborate an apology that would sound meaningful without insulting him anymore. To be honest I was glad I was outside the alley. Even having it at my back made me uneasy now. But he cut my apology short with words that are starting to make sense now No man, I am the one that I am sorry, because just right now, I gave the ghost your name and address.and I shouldnt have done that. I was angry.  
 I didnt even remember what he had explained before about letting a spirit know where you live. I was just surprised and honestly relieved the whole thing was over, so I started laughing.

 I told him I forgave him as long as we left this whole mess behind. I told him he was one of the friends I valued the most here, and didnt want to lose him by being stupid. He made me promise to buy him a beer the next time we met and everything would be alright. We laughed and walked away from the alley. After all, I didnt believe in ghosts But just as I was turning the next corner, I couldnt help but look back for a last look into that dark alley..
 
 Now I wish I had paid more attention. I think whatever was there, whatever haunted Sams dreams, is now in my house. I have no other explanation to what just happened at home.

 I have to go, I have been in this Mcdonald's way too long. I dont want to go back home, but all my gear is there and I have a photoshoot in two hours in Lamma Island. I hope I have time to continue later tonight.
