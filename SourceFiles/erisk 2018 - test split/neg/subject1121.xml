<TEXT> Have you seen those Daily show videos where they go to the Trump Rallies and find people saying stupid stuff? Like why didn't Obama prevent 9/11 and stuff like that.  I watch those, but would never assume them to be indicative of the truth of the average trump supporter.  

This video holds about as much weight.  We dont know how many people he talked to total before choosing the responses he prefers. Its not serious journalism, and anyone taking it seriously has sadly low standards on what they are willing to believe.

Besides, who cares about New York.  There is no voter ID law in NY.  The average person on the street doesnt have to go through with that sort of thing. 

Besides, we arent talking about NY.  We are talking about Wisconsin. Where the population is poorer, and access to transportation is worse.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like I said, Desperate times call for desperate measures. I cant imagine Tarkin, Vader, or Palpatine found it easy to do what had to be done, but I am sure they slept well knowing that the empire would live another day.

Of course, Alderaan would have been unnecessary if the Rebels had not attacked US first, or if Princess Leia had been honest in the location of the Rebel Base.  Its a shame Yavin IV wasnt destroyed as well.

To put it in perspective, when the Empire fell, countless people died.  Soldiers, civilians, men, women, children, etc. Some from the anarchy and warfare, as the new "republic" failed to lock down control.  Some from starvation, as the empire was the only way to effectively manage the whole realm. Many continue to die from crime, which palpatine kept in check.

I would destroy a thousand alderaans if it meant a return to order for myself and my children.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> desperate times call for desperate measures.  Imagine being Tarkin, or Palpatine, or any of the fine men in charge.  We know they aren't bad guys, but they had a choice in that moment, and they chose to serve the empire selflessly, at the cost of their own humanity.  True, there was a known Alderaan Terrorist on board the Freedom Star, but we know for a fact that Alderaan has been opposed to the Empire from the get go.  We know, even if we cant prove, that Bail organna is colluding with rebels.  We can be sure there are were likely whole terrorist networks on Alderaan.  

In that moment, Tarkin had to make a choice, between preserving the empire and protecting the lives of an entire galaxy, or acting justly towards one small planet.  He did what had to be done, as I am sure we all would have.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> buy alcohol or cigarettes

can be done with out of state IDs.  You are also unlikely to be carded once you hit 30 or so, at least in my experience.

open a bank account

could have been done previously, before their ID expired

apply for food stamps

i dont know the requirements.  Could possibly have been done via other means

apply for unemployment

does that require an in state drivers license?

 medicaid/social security

same

but i should be able to vote without an ID

yes.  IF IDs cost money, its kind of like a poll tax.  If IDs dont cost money, they should be both easy and convenient to receive. I should not need an in state ID if I can prove residency through other means.  Clerical issues should be easy to resolve.  </TEXT>

My point was, Nolan doesnt seem to be held in the regard of improving with each film.  TDK and Memento seem to be held as high points, with every other film regarded equally highly, but not necessarily improving over his previous efforts.  </TEXT>

2). If you dont drive, getting to a DMV may be a challenge if it isnt near you

3). If you dont drive, and rely on busses, it will be hard to get to a DMV in the limited time allowed on a lunch break

4). If you have other things going on in your life, such as kids, certain types of jobs, etc, getting to a DMV between 9 and 5 could be a challenge

<TEXT> I think that historically urban communities (regardless of race) have less need for cars, are less likely to have a drivers license. I think communities that make less money/work hourly jobs are going to be less likely to be able to get time off work to go to the DMV, which is only open  during the workday.  I think IF the government is going to require an ID to vote, it should not be a hassle to receive said ID </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nolan has not arguably improved though.  TDK is considered by many to be better than its sequel, Inception (while getting good reviews) is rarely talked about, and Interstellar isn't held in the same high regard it was immediately following its release.  Obviously, Nolan is very talented and everything he does is universally liked. But to be honest, out of everything I have seen of his, Memento was the best, and it was an early film of his </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been looking forward to filmstruck since it was first announced, but havent got around to actually signing up for it yet.  I would like to (so I can branch out in watching more movies and such), but how is the current state of the browser app?  I would ideally want it on roku, but I know it isnt out yet (i have an HDMI cable to nbd).  Is the current state good?

EDIT
Thank you for the feedback.  Based on the strength of the library (as you guys were saying), I decided to sign up and see how the trial goes. I watched Bananas by Woody Allen on an Apple laptop, connected to my TV via an HDMI cable.  The quality was overall good, some splotches in the shadows, but overall comparable to Netflix. The interface leaves a little to be desired, a few more recommendations or means of sorting (also, something indicating the language the film is in). Hopefully a Roku app comes out soon, but in the meantime I am happy so far </TEXT>

<TEXT> honestly, films should be shown in the medium they were originally presented in.  Black and white films shouldnt get color conversions, color films should not get turned black and white.  Remember, the artists behind the scenes crafted their films to look best for their respective mediums, in regards to color or lack thereof.  

I wish more modern movies would choose black and white, since I like the look.

<TEXT> I have always loved the Life Aquatic.  it isnt perfect, and my favorite Anderson film is "moonrise kingdom". Life Aquatic has a strange quality to it.  It feels almost like an animated movie, done with actors.  I agree with you, it is very emotional for me.  Especially Ned's death, and in general Steve's depression throughout the film is very effective. 

As for the technical construction of the film, I dont know that sloppy is the word I'd use.  The tone changes towards the end are a bit jarring, but other than that, I think it was pretty carefully done. Some of the weirder/sloppier aspects may have been by design, since Steve was a failing documentary filmmaker gradually getting worse and worse. At least thats how I interpreted some of those things (like the bizarre special effects). 

Its not his weakest film.  I like it more than Grand Budapest, which I quite like, but I find that it doesnt hit me on an emotional level. grand budapest feels like a living doll house sort of movie.  Its great fun, but it fails to utilize everything it has going for it into a more emotionally affecting finale. Like I said earlier, it isnt as good as moonrise kingdom, which really has the best balance of everything we typically see in Wes Anderson's films.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> the author's tone is pretty misplaced.  Working class families and individuals are underrepresented in movies and TV.  Indie cinema does alright by them, but mainstream hollywood frequently features fairly affluent characters, not a lot of rural america or lower/lower middle class urban america. 

EDIT
While it's nice that Chris wants to see more people like himself on-screen, he is a straight, white male. And Hollywood has an *actual* diversity problem at the momentboth in terms of race and gender. So, actually, maybe it's time for there to be less stories like Chris Pratt's, and more stories about, oh, you know, literally any other marginalized community in this country.

Hollywood'd diversity problem extends beyond race and sex, though those are definitly in the forefront. The class divide on representation is huge as well

He confirmed that all of the trims removed from the original cut negative (in the mid-1990s, to create the SEs) still exist as well. (Thanks to Bits reader Chuck P., who attended this event, for his firsthand report.) So what does all that mean to you?
In summary: When George Lucas says that the original Star Wars no longer exists, its a little like Obi-Wan telling Luke that Darth Vader killed his father; hes speaking truthfully from a certain point of view. From any other point of view, however, its silliness. The point is, while it is essentially technically true that the 77 cut negative no longer exists in its original state, it is also technically true that it could be re-built if so desired. All of the needed film elements still survive and have been preserved

EDIT

basically, 20th century fox says that all of the removed bits of star wars remain in their original form in their vault, or something to that extent.

<TEXT> i mean, I doubt he went and physically edited the original negatives of the film.  that'd be a very impractical way to do things.  SOME of the SE changes are irreversible due to damage to the film (some of the shifting in shot composition is to crop out damage to the negatives), and its likely that a restored version would have to digitally replicate some of the transitions, possibly re composite the effects...but the original negative still exists, it is still restorable   </TEXT>

EDIT
for reference, the scene was included in the comic book version of ANH, but there was no description of jabba (since they lacked the money to do the stop motion). He looked like [this](http://cdn2us.denofgeek.com/sites/denofgeekus/files/styles/article_width/public/swjabba.jpg?itok=5wwk2QhS) </TEXT>

<TEXT>  the worst star wars movie of all

no.

Look, there is a lot of room for improvement, sure. There are aspects of the way Lucas did things in the OT and the PT that I miss in the new movies.

But the cinematography and dialogue in TFA blow episodes one and two out of the water, and definitly give episodes 3 and 6 a run for their money.  The acting and directing of individual scenes is better than in the PT, even the pretty good Episode 3.

How the fuck is Leia still in a rebel alliance? They won the war she is the government, but Disney's marketing team realized rebel characters are more popular than government ones.

yeah, thats poorly explained (and requires some combo of books to get a better idea to the political climate of ther galaxy) but it isnt like rebellions that topple huge empires do so without a ton if messy stuff for decades. It isnt explained well, but it isnt far fetched either. 

they gotta phase out all the old white men from the original cast because thats what Disney is all about.

i mean, the movie isnt about the old characters. its about new characters. 

Marvel and Disney's message is anti-western and anti-white

oh grow the fuck up and get out of my fandom </TEXT>

<TEXT> Star Wars wasnt great due to its FX alone. It was the marriage of genres, making a movie that felt (at the time) both fresh and nostalgic, that made it such an icon.  If it had just been the FX, it would have died in time, like other blockbusters.

That said, the saga is in trouble if moving forward is all about nostalgia and appeasing fans, and not looking at what actually made the original so good.  </TEXT>

I like the scene in Episode 2 where he tells padme he has to go to tatooine, and him returning with his mothers body. I like him looking out the jedi temple windows in episode 3, I like when he finds out padme is pregnant.  All in all, Episode 3 is pretty good from his end.

FORCING politicians to keep their promises means they cant react to the ever changing political climates in the country.  it could also limit a politicians ability to negotiate with other parties and deal with incremental changes.

<TEXT> 1). Flavor. the flavor of potato chips is very salty. overwhelmingly so, compared to a regular tortilla chip.  Potato chips would not be conducive to guacamole or a lot of salsas, because they would overwhelm it with salt.  A potato chip is best enjoyed with either a mild dipping sauce or none at all.  If you have a good dip, it will be wasted by the potato chip.  Tortilla chips taste mild (like a tortilla does) but generally hold up to dips without overwhelming anything

2). texture. A potato chip is weird and thin, and will get soggy with a wet salsa.  I am not sure where you are getting that they are sturdier. compare Lays to your average tortilla chip.  Even thin tortilla chips are more solid than a potato chip, and will do better when dipped in salsa.  Most tortilla chips are rather thick and will do better with good amounts of guac compared to the potato chip

3). nachos.  I dont want to imagine potato chip nachos. the tortilla chip is more versatile due to its sturdiness and more mild flavor.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, watchmen is good.  

However, it is good because the comic is good. Snyder sticks very closely to the source material, so the depth is not of his doing. In fact, it is shallow in that it seems like snyder had a surface level appreciation for the graphic novel, but due to the high quality of the source, created something quite good.

The expendables has substance if you view it as a semi parody of the kinds of movies the actors involved typically star in.  Its silly over the top fun.  The Avengers was well written pseudo serious action, but not particularly deep.  The great source of watchmen makes it deeper than either, but Snyder had little to do with that.

<TEXT> can you give a few examples?  Most indie films tend to skew shorter (closer to 90 minutes, maybe 2 hours).

My only thoughts is that slower pieces (say, manchester by the sea) are totally different in appeal than epics.  They have more time to breathe, and can be deeper in their character study, give some time for reflection while watching, but even MBTS is just about 2.5 hours, maybe less.

<TEXT> Marvel is suffering due to too many events, crossovers, and an increasingly convoluted storyline. They are suffering due to bad writing above all else.  Diversity isnt the reason of this bad writing, it just happens to be happening at the same time.

For example, Miles Morales was great back when it launched. great writing, great characters, great take on the world.  However, the recent stuff (such as the spidergwen crossover) is pretty lame.  

On the other hand, I recently started the most recent iteration of hawkeye, and quite like it (that likely counts as pushing diverisity, since it stars a woman in a traditional male role, and one who is a feminist as well). 

The writing would be bad, regardless of if they had a diversity agenda or not.  

it seems your issue is with the politics, not quality, of marvel comics. </TEXT>

this is no ones opinion. Its much faster paced than ANH at the very least.

Regardless, TFA could have used a little more dialogue to help set the universe. This scene runs far too long for what it says (and the dialogue just isnt great in much of it), but aspects of it should have been included. More lines about the nature the state of the universe, and the mythology of the world, would have helped immensely (think back to ANH)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We know it was more heavily focussed on family, and likely followed younger children (luke/leias children or grandchildren, preteen aged probably).  He said that, conceptually, that the first trilogy (1-3) is political in nature, the second is personal, and the third is spiritual.  His earliest notes from the 70s would have featured Luke as an Obi Wan type figure.

Kathleen Kennedy says that his stories were a jumping off point for development of the sequel trilogy, and all of the films in development (except for rogue one) are based on his basic treatments. Lucas was invited to be a member of the production team, writing the story and being on the story team, but was uncomfortable with the lack of total control over the end product (he would have been a prominent voice, but still just 1 voice among several). 

So basically, we don't know for sure, but it likely had Luke introduced much earlier (much like the the early drafts for episode 7) and featured younger characters as the leads (potentially characters that became rey and finn, but skywalkers) </TEXT>

grades you earn are mostly reliant on ass licking and how much your teacher likes you, more than on actual performance anyways

This was not my experience. Grades are normally objective, based on test performance and homework completion

Usally people will hire you on your experience+college courses and not on your grades.

maybe. Having good grades can make an impact when it comes down to securing internships, which is how you get that experience. Saying you graduated magna cum laude with 3 internships is a lot better than graduating with neither of those </TEXT>

the events, as I understand them were

2). first cops determine it isnt a threat
3). people complain that the passed out man is still there
4). Manney arrives, decides to frisk the passed out man (not procedure)
5). the schizophrenic man freaks out, because someone is touching him. gets violent

<TEXT> I said milwaukee doesnt have stop and frisk.  Its mainly NYC that has a problem with it. lol

The punishment should fit the crime. If you're out with your friends stealing cars you should be locked up and then put on probation. Innocent people shouldn't suffer nor should all the kids in the city who are not out stealing cars. You act like it's the honor student making a mistake due to peer pressure. It's not. It's kids who did it once and will do it again if let off easy. Life has consequences and when you're young there's too much opportunity through MPS and other groups around town to be out making bad decisions like that.

Do you want the city to have worse gang problems?  Because this is how you get worse gang problems.

I dont know the solution, but I know that throwing kids in jail isnt going to help. We need more in the way of rehabbing JDs, otherwise we will have a much worse crime problem 10-15 years from now.  </TEXT>

But yeah, plot sizes are too small.  No country estates will spawn, no massive (realistic) farms.

<TEXT> hate to burst your bubble, but most progressives are not communists. Maybe, at best, we have some socialist leanings (pro union, pro socialized healthcare, etc). Most of us acknowledge and appreciate the benefits of capitalism (even if we do not support unregulated markets). To go a step further, progressives are typically against government overreaches, even those that support the common good.  So I'm not sure HOW you get communism out of all of this 

As for cultural marxism, I dont see how a private  company choosing to have gay characters in their films, and people applauding them for it, is undermining western values. 

if you dont like it, go and watch more tim allen movies, or hell, go make a movie of your own. it is your right as an American to showcase what a shithead you are, just dont complain if no one wants to indulge it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is a traffic guide on the sidebar which may be helpful. 

Basically you want to follow a sort of road hierarchy, with highways being like a spine with zero stoplights  (only on and off ramps), connecting avenues with minimal stop lights (try using two sets of one way roads to give a sort of "divided highway" style of Avenue) and then filling if out with roads, which would be local traffic only. It's hard to tell for sure what exactly is causing your traffic (probably people from the highway needing to travel a long ways to an industrial area) but keeping good road hierarchy will make all of your traffic a lot smoother and your cities more logical  </TEXT>

The presidents budget cuts funding for early-childhood education, public housing, transit, food assistance, and job training  all programs that disproportionately benefit single mothers in cities with low median incomes. And it also abolishes the Appalachian Regional Commission and Rural Business-Cooperative Service, while shrinking the Labor Department  all moves that disadvantage coal miners.

<TEXT> There is more to college than job prep. People with this thought process undervalue quality education as a whole.

Beyond that, if we cut student loans/grants for low paying fields (say, the arts), then we create a culture where all commercial art is made by the upper class. There is already a huge class based barrier to entry in the arts, and prohibiting poorer students from attending good art school will kill a lot of opportunities for poor aspiring artists. Sure, they can learn a lot on their own, but without schools they will have less access to networking, mentors, solid critique, etc.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If instead of that, I took to the internet and complained over and over about how I spent good money on my hamburger, and the restaurant is anti-consumer, and how charging me for ketchup packets is an outrage, what would you think of me?

I mean...people do that. Look at Yelp. Look at tripadvisor.  There are whole websites designed to critiquing food establishments. 

If I'm unhappy with that restaurant's hamburgers, I need to shut the hell up and stop buying that restaurant's hamburgers. If all restaurants start making shit hamburgers, then maybe I need to go try a taco joint or something because hamburgers aren't cutting it anymore.

For my sake, if you eat a particularly bad burger, PLEASE complain so I know not to waste money on it.

<TEXT> I disagree, though I think TFA could have been stronger for sure. Try to think, what would the new trilogy have looked like if ROTJ's aftermath had been peachy?  I can't imagine it being very interesting.

Whats cool about TFA, even if it is a bit depressing, is showing just how hard nation building is, and showing how even the best revolutions can lead to weak, ineffective governments prone to insurrections. This opens up some ground for the movies to have more gray area morality (though TFA has not taken advantage of this). In that sense, there is a potential for the sequel trilogy to be the perfect middle ground between the politics of the PT and the pulpy action + spirituality of the OT. Whether they take the opportunity is anyone's guess at this point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Calvin and Hobbes is great, one of my favorites, no doubt.

Since I cant change your taste, I instead wanted to address the idea of "best". Calvin and Hobbes, for all of its greatness, sticks to a pretty conventional set up.  There is no real evolution or growth of the characters.

I think Doonesbury takes the comic format to a new level, managing to be funny, tell a serialized story, and remain politically relevant for like 40 years now. If we are looking at objective best, rather than subjective best, I think Doonesbury is unparalleled in terms of what it does with the format  </TEXT>

Heres what the math should look like (that is, if Richmans initial study was accuratewhich many researchers doubt). If 6.4 percent of the estimated 20.3 million noncitizens in the US voted, and if just 81.8 percent of them voted for Clinton (the percentage who voted for Obama in his 2008 study), thats an added margin of a little more than 835,000 votes. In other words: Even with all of those supposedly fraudulent ballots, Clinton still would have won the popular vote by more than 2 million votes.

<TEXT> O'Keefe does have a history of heavily distorting facts. 

The O'keefe video (which I watched) was likely heavily edited. The camera rarely showed mouths moving, frequently had faces out of the picture for long periods of time. Did he ever release the raw footage, for an independent source to review? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Didnt the democunts get caught committing voter fraud in multi-able states

no, they did not

Some states are so lax on voting laws you could be a north Korean strait off the boat and vote with out any form of ID

you still typically need an ID, or at least a valid ssn, to register

Im highly suspicious that Hillary won the popular vote fairly

virtually every city voted her way, and 60% of the population lives in an urban environment  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like the PT, quite a bit.  That being said, I know the films have a lot of weaknesses when compared to other films.

1). episodes 2 and 3 are all talk, little showing. 

2). The plot requires supplementary material to make a ton of sense. I like the story, because I am a fan, but it isnt right for a movie to rely on other works heavily. 

3). Anakin's character is never quite right. Compare him in the movies to him in the animated clone wars. In the movies, he is whiny. Like a teenager as intended, but hard to root for. In the show, he is goofy, powerful, cocky, and loyal. the seeds of the darkside are evident in him, but he seems like a brave warrior, the best starpilot in the galaxy, and a good friend

4). building on that, there isnt a strong POV for the audience to identify with. This isnt inherently bad, but these particular films could have used it

5). Ahead of their time SFX?  you betcha. still not up to where they need to be based on how much they were used? also correct

6). Episode 3 especially feels like it was directed by a tired person.  The 100% cgi sequences are great, because lucas could sit down and direct them at his own pace. You can feel that he lacks the patience for live action. Compare the yoda vs palpatine fight to Anakin vs Obi wan. Compare obi vs obi wan to obi wan vs Maul in episode one. Maul's death fight is fantastic. The one in ROTS is shot like a conversation, and way too close. 

7). the actors never feel immersed in their environments.  </TEXT>

Moonlight is a more personal story. Written better. Less clichd characters. Beyond that, it has a distinct visual look (lala land borrowed from old movies), and great acting.

<TEXT> oh for sure

in real life politics, I am skeptical of overly centralized control, but this would be the pro empire argument.

the republic was dying due to infighting and the slow moving political process. A private company invaded a planet, and the corruption was so high it would have taken months through the courts to change it. Sheev was the alternative. With emergency powers, he could make quick decisions over a number of issues that, under a huge republic, would have taken too long in deliberation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I literally said punching then isnt going to do a lot of good.

But punching someone is dangerous in the sense that you could break someones nose, or crack a bone or something. White supremacy is dangerous in that it could create a nationwide movement that seeks to oppress, if not outright kill, non whites.

if punching neo nazis helped, I'd advocate for it. However, I think it generates more sympathy from people than anything else </TEXT>

<TEXT> the main subreddits rule by consensus. thats the nature of a content aggregator site. If this were a traditional forum, without scores attached to posts, and listed by time of the comment being made, then it would seem less echoi chambery.

take /r/politics, for instance. the majority is democrats, because reddit is primarily used by people who typically are democrats. As a result, left leaning news floats up, right leaning news floats down. Every subreddit operates this way based on whatever the niche opinion of the day is. 

get to less populated subs, or subs without a culture of downvoting other opinions, and you will see that there is a diversity of opinions on reddit </TEXT>

I'd be interested to see this, as this sort of thing is always an interesting read!

BLM was founded based on cops killing unarmed black men at high rates, but has also targeted over policing, over convictions, and other things contributing to the cycle of young black men getting sucked into a life of crime.

The conversation we need to have is about race. Maybe not solely about race, and certainly not exclusively blaming race for every arrest ever made, but there is a race conversation to be had </TEXT>

<TEXT> again, I wont call you a racist. but these numbers do not tell a full story. It ignores the poverty inflicted on these communities, which is what led to the gang violence we see today. Yes, these communities have a violence problem, which stems from over charging minor offenses (creating cycles of poverty and violence).

Itd be interesting to compare these statistic to statistics for urban, poor white communities. However, much of the poor white communities are in rural areas, and thus do not face these issues (whats an rural gang gonna do) </TEXT>

<TEXT> How do you explain that race relations is now at the lowest point it has been since at least the 90's?

an end to race relations complacency. problems never went away, but social media + 24 hour news cycle + everyone now has a camera means that the establishment is more easily held accountable. 1998, if a cop shot an unarmed man, its his word against no ones'. 20 years later, we have body cams, bystanders with cell phones, facebook live, and a ton of tools to show whats going on.  The racism never went away, it was just hidden. Now its out in thew open. and people are pissed, upset that they didnt know what terrible stuff was happening in their own backyards. 

It also helps that programs to help minorities, such as bussing programs, were ended in the 80s, and we are feeling the effects of broken schools, perpetually impoverished communities, and increasing gentrification.

the solution to race relations is fighting for equality, not ignoring it as a means to keep the peace.

As for people calling you racist, you dont seem racist. However, you do not seem interested in programs to fix broken communities, and do not seem to feel that we, as white people, have benefitted from programs historically designed to help us and hurt ethnic minorities. and that IS racist  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would disagree with you there, mainly because I dont consider what the left is doing to be "identity politics". After the civil rights movement, there were still (and are still) a number of injustices towards ethnic/religious/sexual minorities. For a while people kind of just buried it while saying "racism is dead".

So now we combat that, and it can kind of look like judging people based on their skin, but its to combat the injustices still inherent in the system 

EDIT

the left isnt making "identity" a defining feature as to your future. The left is acknowledging that identity is still being used as a tool for discrimination, and in identifying it, are able to combat it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> the bussing program totally worked though. the achievement gap was nearly closed after a generation of bussing, and it came back as soon as bussing programs were ended. People, having gained an education and employment, would be best situated to fixing their communities through self betterment. 

I live in the city. I dont know if it would impact me. I might find myself wanting to drive into a suburb one day. for any number of reasons. I have a job, I pay taxes, so it is my right to drive on roads I am a partial owner of. 

Actually, I like driving and walking through nice neighborhoods. I enjoy looking at cool houses, especially old ones. My girlfriend and I always pick out our favorites and judge people for their odd paint choices, and talk about what we would do differently.  So I would be affected

River west sounds like a nice neighborhood for you if you're not there already

I enjoy parts of riverwest, but I like living near the lake. not sure what your point was with that.

<TEXT> So it's ok for apartments to do it. Clubs to do it. But not suburbs.

Yes. private property is not public space. You can stand on the sidewalk, but stay off my lawn.

This just strengthens the resolve of my argument. Suburbs should be allowed to restrict entry based on residence. Crime will drop.

There is no legal precedence for suburbs to have this power.

This sets a bad example for future laws.  I mean, it would never happen, it wouldnt be a huge jump to "if you live in x area, you need a pass to leave that area" to contain crime.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> clubs are privatly owned, and have a right to control membership. Same reason I have a key for my apartment, and not yours (or anyone elses). I have permission to enter private property, shown through a key.

Roads are public property. They are publicly funded, and are jointly owned by all of us. If you want a pay-to-play suburb, find a gated community, or gated apartment complex. If you live on a publicly funded, you don't have that luxury. 

EDIT
If you have no business being out in the burbs then why would you go? 

none of your business. Maybe I am walking my dog. maybe I am crashing with a friend, or hoping that a side road could help me avoid traffic. Its the same old "law abiding citizens have nothing to fear" slippery slope that I would rather not see in public places in America.

In short, clubs can maintain membership and be exclusive or open. who cares. a gated community requires permission, because its also private property. A suburb is build on public streets, and access cannot be restricted. End of story

<TEXT> how would this work, logistically? roads would have to be totally blocked off with checkpoints. consider how many entries a lot of residential communities have, and how many suburbs would need to be covered. seeing as this would need to be 24 hour, or at least covering a night shift if we dont worry about daytime crime containment. So a ton of people to be hired, trained, etc. huge budget increase, unless we remove them from patrolling roads (letting drunk drivers and active criminals drive away free).

So now you've blocked off all side roads leading into burbs. How would we deal with the traffic increase, due to funneling people using nearby commercial areas ?

How do we prevent some level of racial profiling in the screening of who can or cannot enter the area.  

This sounds a lot like some old timey south african "show me your papers" policy, that will ultimately just restrict the movements of poor people  </TEXT>

<TEXT> its not about social commentary. Im not saying LaLa land had to be about race relations in southern California.

as for the call back bit, I've seen old musicals, and did not feel that this held up. but thats just an opinion. Look at singing in the rain. Its goofy plot line is elevated by inspired dance scenes. Look at 7 brides for 7 brothers for the same thing. Look at Guys and Dolls, which has no dancing, but superbly written and performed songs. LaLa land has some inspired moments (the opening, the griffith park scene, the end) some good songs (emma stone's auditon, her and ryan gosling looking for her car) and some good scenes in it. 

LaLa land is good, but its *just* good. a solid 3.5/5, that id recommend to friends once its out on dvd/streaming </TEXT>

<TEXT> i can speak towards the racism bit.

The movie takes place in LA. in fact, its right in the title. LA has a large non white populations, which arent well represented. By that measure, it does a poor job of representing LA and the racial makeup of the area.

As for the Jazz bit, jazz has historically been played and enjoyed by black people (though now its very popular with no one). Its not racist that he is a white guy wanting to play old jazz, but it does contribute to a sort of erasure to the history and culture of jazz, and that erasure (on a large scale, not just lala land) is racist.

<TEXT> just like constant impeding on Obama slowed down republican popularity?

of those 10 states, they arent all solid red. WI, for example, has blue cities which account for a lot of the population, and an unpopular republican governor. Just because trump was able to beat clinton doesnt mean that republicans can win against democrats. Some of those wins were due to third party votes against clinton, voters who could likely vote dem in those states

It will be more clear in a year or so, but lets see how trumps national popularity is looking down the road.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Scooby Doo mystery incorporated showed the perfect way to get a modern audience to care about scooby doo. By incorporating newer tech, combined with a 60s/70s aesthetic, and a somewhat satirical take on the characters, they made a show which is both enjoyable to kids who want to watch scooby doom and older audiences with fond memories of it as a kid. 

The movie could have done the same, by presenting a burtonesque neo gothic (but still goofy) aesthetic, and allowing the inherent silliness of the characters to stand on their own. That and having them played by younger actors, combined with a script that is funny, could have made a good movie </TEXT>

<TEXT> the book "bloodlines" (in the current canon) introduces a lot of things about the rise of the first order, the resistance, and the republic. While I know no one (except me) wants a super political star wars, some of that books plot should have been present in the film's first act, or at least alluded to. 

Basically, after mon mothma retired, the republic grew increasingly partisan, with no powers given to their head of state (for fear of a future palpatine), and they grew ineffective. Ultimately, planets that had been imperial loyalists during the empire and persuaded their new political allies to donate and store money in such a way that it funded a new group of fascist neo imperials. The republic still lacks the political will to pass bills to build anything more than a basic security force, so Leia broke away to form a militia army with other ex rebels.  

Its a good story, but it needed to be conveyed somehow in the movie </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are right that things are improving, but consider your place in all of this. White people are generally low risk, upper middle class is low risk, and straight people are low risk. Things are already uncomfortable for people who do not fit that mold, and things could get much worse.

I have a cousin who is a devout muslim, and dresses in a somewhat traditional style (despite being born in the USA). Should people opposed to the middle east, or muslims in general, feel emboldened by an increasing anti islamic foreign policy, he would be at risk. 

I have a lot of friends and relatives who fall on the LGBT spectrum. Should gay marriage be rolled back, as it could based on who trump appoints to the SC, they would be at risk.

The past 8 years have seen some great strides, but a lot of the good things are still very new. Just because your life is boring, a lot of people are not comfortable, a lot of injustices still exist, and things could get a lot worse based on how things are handled right now  </TEXT>

I mean, it is soon for something being done about it. Not that this isnt worthy of alarm, but even in the best circumstances, washington is slow to react. Everything takes time, whether its elected officials working to get the nuances of a bill figured out, or lawyers putting together a lawsuit to overturn the executive order, or anything like that.

If/When trump ignores the courts or congress, then he have a problem. 

This feels a bit like a coup, but so far hard to say </TEXT>

As for functionality, the only function of the mouse that she is particularly fond of is the mouse's ability to swipe and switch between screens, so ideally we would like something to preserve that function.

<TEXT> For Rogue One, I want to do a different sort of 'Star Wars' Marathon, where I watch films that inspired the movies, rather than the movies themselves.
I already know a few films that should definitly make this list, and was wondering if you guys have any suggestions. So far im at:
1). The Hidden Fortress
2). Original Flash Gordon serials
3). Wings

I know those were all big inspirations to George Lucas, but I don't know about what inspired/informed other directors/writers at the helm. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am going to be driving from California to Wisconsin at the end of the month, and realized I never updated by inspection sticker when I moved from Maine two years ago.  I still have my Maine plates, with up to date registration and insurance. California, to my understanding, doesnt have car inspection the same way Maine does, and has a smog test.  I never got smog tested because...I dont know. never had problems though
my question is
A). Do states enforce out of state inspection stickers being expired?
B). if yes. will a CA smog test be fine, seeing as Maine requires a different sort of inspection
C). Any other road trip related laws I should know about?

thanks! </TEXT>

Im graduated with a film degree and have interned in the past, as well as a few gigs.  If anyone can give any pointers on working in film in Milwaukee, That'd be fantastic! </TEXT>

<TITLE> How smoothly do various paradox games run? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-07 20:26:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi!
I've been playing a lot of CK2 and have been thinking about checking out some other paradox games.  Here's the catch:  Im using an old netbook (1ghz processor, 2gb ram, idk any other stats off the top of my head).  CK2 runs at maybe half speed with a bunch of graphics turned off (worth it).  its pretty smooth, except for the menus for choosing marriage and save time is long.

Basically, I was wondering, compared to CK2, how smoothly do EU4 and Vicky2 run?  They all seem to have similar system reqs, but if they run less smooth than ck2, but computer might explode.  and that'd be a bummer.

The reason I'm on a netbook is a recent move and an inability to easily get my old desktop out here.  Its also a broken desktop computer, so my motivation to get it out here and fix it is low.  but thats neither here nor there. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is CK1 Worth it? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi.  I love CK2, but recently moved and won't have access to a working desktop computer for a while.  My only computer is a fairly good netbook, but still...its a netbook.  It should be able to run CK1, but  is it worth it?  Or will I find it frustrating after having played CK2

Alternatively, has anyone been able to run CK2 on low end computers?  I have a 1.0 ghz processor  and 2 gb of ram (though games requiring a little more, such as civ 4, have performed well).  That said, I doubt it will run ck2, which needs like 2.5 ghz to run.

Anyhow.  CK1.  Thoughts?  any good tutorials and such? </TEXT>

Are there any tricks to stop the tears? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, just curious where you guys go/went to school for film (for those of you who went) and how you like it.

I'm at Emerson college right now, and I like it. Some equipment shortages and not the hardest grading scale in the world, but upper level film classes are dope.

How about you guys? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Ideal Director for Episode VII </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-01-19 20:09:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We know JJ Abrams said no. Zack Snyder has his own side Star Wars project going on, so he wont be doing VII, Guillermo del Torro said no, Joss Whedon said no, Tarantino said no, the guy who did "Safety not guaranteed" is busy, and Spielberg said no.
I know a few others did but I cant think of them off the top of my head.
That being said, who is your ideal director for Episode VII
Personally I would like to see something from a director who works primarily outside of the action genre (Irvin Kershner did mostly character dramas, George Lucas did star wars right after a teenage comedy). 
I was thinking the Duplas Brothers would have an interesting take, as would Lena Dunham. Both of them work with down to earth dramas that are very rooted in reality and I think both directors understand how people work. And they are young, which is nice.

Anyhow, what are your thoughts
