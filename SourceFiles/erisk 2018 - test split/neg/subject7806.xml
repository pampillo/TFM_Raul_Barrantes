<TITLE> Childhood Memories, Part I: How I Killed My Sister When I Was Two </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-10 00:31:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am sure you sleep well at night after reading the stories you find here. Everyday, with every new story upvoted, you already know everything is fictional, but acts out as a believer because of the rules of the sub.

Well, I wish I could do the same. My story here will not be fictional, or in any way "dilluted" out of respect for any of the characters present here. For a fact, I can say that I'll lack some depth on certain parts of the narrative for lack of memory, not out of fear; you see, these events happened up until I was 9, and some of them lack enough to be confusing. But what can I say? When you're young and want to forget certain traumatic events, you slowly start to forget them until they fade away at some point.

I guess I should present myself and my past first. I don't see the need of using my real name, so let's just say it's Alex. I was born on a small hospital somewhere on the East of So Paulo, and that's it. The day I was born, my older sister had to go from house to house close to where we lived to ask for baby clothing, as my family had little to no money to even buy one - and the money we had was either spent on what food we could get... or my father spent it on alcohol.

My father always wanted a son. For his lack of luck (or some form of karma, probably, though I am not one of believing it), on his four attempts of having a male child, every single one was born a girl. 

The first was a disappointment. She was born when the family still held a good amount of money; for the next five years, she lived an exceptional life, being homeschooled from an early age and being teached piano classes every Wednesday. My father, although disappointed, did not mind his first child being a girl. For security reasons, just call her Lucy.

The second came two years later, and made him feel angry. She was also a girl (which I'll call Cleo), and a stronger one, but he did not care. When she was born, he blamed my mother for not giving him his "well deserved son".

That was when money started to grow scarce, and the stronger beatings began. Before, he'd do so only on a few moments and away from his daughter; after his second child was born, he did not care at all, and simply did it, also using it as a way of impregnating his children's mind with fear.

Then, one year later, his third child was born, and she made him feel scared. Scared because she never felt fear. Scared, because she knew everything that would happen later on with details, including her own death. Scared, because she had a strong presence in front of him. Let's call her Elizabeth; she predicted that she was going to die when she was four years old.

Then, two years later, I was born. My family was in such state of poverty that they almost never had butter, and food was mostly composed of pure bread with a cup of coffee for each. In fact, when I was four months old, my mother did not breastfeed me anymore; at that age, I was already being fed with cow milk mixed with coffee by my own sisters, as my mother never had the time to feed me, overworking herself with cleaning other people's houses and washing and ironing clothes for the neighbours. She didn't manage the money of the house, though: my father did. That's why we were always lacking food.

My father was not very present on my childhood. Actually, the only person who ever dealt with him on a closer level was Lucy, but as the elder child, she was the favourite one of the bunch: mom liked her more than the other three, and Lucy had to deal with less fear than her sisters. When she was the only child, my father treated her like a little princess; at that age, she was not aware of what happened between her parents, nor the things her father did when he was outside home. He was a drunkard, addicted to both alcohol and gambling, and when he was with his "friends" on the bar, he'd smoke. Plus, he cheated on my mother, both with other women he deemed more attractive and with prostitutes.

But mom never told her. Lucy just learned about that later, when she was 12. The only bad thing she knew he did was the beating.

Cleo... was pretty left out. She had the surname of my father, and considering how both my mom and father's families were "rivals", treating the other side as despicable, she never got to be treated properly inside my mom's family. See, grandma would often call her a bastard simply because of the surname difference. On the other hand, dad's family received her well, a lot better than it ever did with any other child of his. 

Along with the poor treatment she received from her relatives, she was often blamed for the lack of money that came along after she was born: as my parents had to move out from hundreds of houses lots and lots of times, each because my father would not pay the rent properly, he'd put the guilt on her and on grandma.

Cleo also never knew about his wrongdoings, and thus believed him when he said it was her fault. She would find out a lot later as well that it was a lie.

Elizabeth... I can't truly remember a lot from her. What I do remember is that she was both the happiest and the saddest of the bunch; her emotions were a complete paradox, probably because of her future sight. I know, it sounds impossible and even odd, but she truly *did* that. She would always tell us what she saw during these events.

That includes her death. I was the one who caused it.

You see, she was around four years old when she told us that; she never told about these sights to my father, only us, and this one was no exception. But still, she saw her own death, and on the vision, Elizabeth was hit by a car and died instantly.

Back then, we dismissed it. I, for one, also dismissed it, more because I was too young to understand than anything, but also because the thought of having my own sister dying scared and saddened me.
It happened one week later.

I was playing with the neighbour kids on the other side of the street, on the unused sidewalk. I still remember vividly: they had a collection of dolls, and some of them were even expensive (though I can't confirm this one here as I didn't have a lot of toys; everything would be expensive according to the amount of money we had).

One of them decided that I should have one of the dolls; I remember that she knew I only played with her and her sister when it was "dollhouse" because I never had a single one, and thus, on a moment of pity, she decided to give one to me. It was not her favourite, of course, but it was pretty and well groomed. It was a blonde one, with a pink dress on an "Alice in Wonderland"ish style.

I called for Elizabeth so she could come and see the doll I received as a present. Back then, we were close, and as the younger ones, we would be often left out from the plays of the two older ones for reasons we never truly understood; thus, whenever we received something, we'd show it to each other and be happy for these things.

It was no exception.

But the final result was different.

As she was crossing the street, she forgot to see if anyone was coming by. Our street had a long history of crazy drivers inside Volkswagen automobiles, so we always had to check before crossing *lots of times* before we even dared to put a foot outside the sidewalk.

That was also no exception to the rule.

She was hit by a green Volkswagen Carocha in front of me.

The image of her, smiling, crossing the street to see me and suddenly being forcefully dragged by a car at over 110 km/hour and being splatted on the street still feels recent.
The driver called an ambulance, and Elizabeth was taken in a hurry to the hospital. 

She died on the same day.

Everything went by in a blur after that. Mom would often tell me it was not my fault later on, but you know when the person treats you differently after the incident? Well, I felt it on my skin, even if she tried to fake she did not. It was hard not to when you're already the outcast child: you know the neglecting you get. A new one would surely stand out and feel different.

Elizabeth's funeral was pretty empty. Nobody wanted to visit her grave.

Years later, everyone forgot the cemetery her body was.

Considering the entire incident, my family, including aunts, grandma, *everyone*, tried to erase her existence from the family. We would not mention her name; we took every picture we had of her away and burned it; we donated her clothes, and her toys were given to the orphanage. When asked, mom would say she had only three children.

But I did not forget Elizabeth.

Since that day, I never played with that doll. I threw it away and avoided dolls for a long time, not even daring to look at one. My sisters would make a pained expression whenever someone mentioned Elizabeth's name, but in front of me, they would not dare to talk about it. In a way, I believe they thought it would keep me from feeling guilty, from feeling the pressure and weight of what I did.

But it was always there, on the back of my mind. After all, though, I guess they tried to keep me away from committing suicide -- which was something my mother herself would try to do later on.

But that's for another story.

Honestly, this always cracks me up because of the kind of people I deal with. There's an older man who often goes to where I work at, and he's always all about "how young women are asking for it".

That is, until he sees me. He literally shuts up when I'm present and is *scared* of me. According to my boss, every other woman who worked here had to deal with some sort of verbal harassment from him (and my boss indeed did try to call his attention to something else to avoid situations like these back then, even apologising to these women later on), but me? He's scared shitless of me. He tries to go away as fast as possible from me because I'm taller than him and *somehow* have the "eyes of an angry commie ready to stalk and kill".

<TEXT> I've seen more of the types who say that if they were the prince charming, they'd get all da boosy.

Thing is, they thought they got good a bit too early :v but yeah, I am aware of the bunch you mentioned here. Still, it's a fantasy based world but these bits have pinches of reality (and that is also something kids notice; I personally did because I dealt with neighbours who fit into a lot of these things back then). As lots of people said here already, those who tend to fall for it have a bad background (coupled with low self esteem) that can fuck things up.

Aaaaanyway, thanks for the compliment; me is not native speaker :P

Edit: as for the "prince charming" there, I can make a correlation with the Shrek's prince charming to get the point better. Seems like he'll be that, but in reality, he's fucked up and goes back to the same trope of Disney villains. lol </TEXT>

<TITLE> "A Fantastic World" - or why Disney's got nothing to do with your delusional mysoginy </TITLE>

<TEXT> "Stupid Disney movies lied to me!"

Disney did not lie to you, and the proof is within the reach of its villains. Why? Because most of your male childhood villains are exactly what the manosphere advocates for with a pinch of "magic" as to not turn them into characters too somber to be put in a kids' animation.

We're all aware of how unsufferably cringeworthy Gaston was (or is, if you watched the 2017 remake), and how he is proud of his manliness on some uneven ways. In fact, the remake shows that with even more precision: his enraged expression hid behind what probably would be perceived as "amused mastery", how he describes his dream marriage with Belle exactly like manospherians also dream of... and the fact that he describes her as "prey", and whose nature is to be prey, "waiting to be hunted" by a man. And I didn't even begin to describe the fact that he depends on his hunting companion to feel "validated" - not even noticing that the compliments are mostly originated by an one-sided attraction of the poor man, but you know, *nobody is as oblivious as Gaston~* -, nor how he feels intimidated by Belle's relative independence and right to reject him.

Outside the princesses universe, there is also a perfect example inside The Lion King. The acceptance of Mufasa did not come from his "alpha"ness - one can even argue he was "beta", considering that his proximity with his son did not come from attempts to dread Simba's mother, but purely based on his *feelings* for his own child, as well as on teaching his son what one could also argue were "beta values" or morality -, but from his care and dedication. That can be proved by his (tragic) death, in which he took his own life to save Simba. Also on the same animation, we have Scar as the perfect example of "alpha captain": his will is the only one that matters, and he ought to use Machiavellian tactics to remain in control by having hyenas as allies. And as we can notice by the ending, there were not as many lions on his side: as soon as Simba was found to be alive and seen as a possible saviour out of the current situation, the "revolution" began. And without a CCCP National Anthem playing on the background. In short: Scar was also an example, on his personality, of what the manosphere can advocate for, and the conclusion is that 1. he was downright wrong and a cartoon example of "dark triad" based character and 2. his lack of care, coupled with the arrogance to think himself as hard (or even impossible) to outsmart, brought his ruin.

Aladdin also has his share of "manospherian villain". Jafar is unescrupulous and, along with the already mentioned Gaston, feels intimidated and uneasy about Jasmine's personality and rejection. Hell, even Aladdin himself had his share of manosphere moment on a belief he later found to be wrong: his first wish was an attempt to impress Jasmine, as he thought being powerful and wealthy would get him her love. In reality - and also proved by the beginning of the animation -, she didn't care enough for that. Either way, back to Jafar: he thought himself smart and superior to everyone else, including feeling above everyone else, in your typical r/iamverysmart way.

And let's not start on the lovability of the *blue* Genie. He'd be the "funny beta" to redpillers if he was real, much probably, and well, most non-redpilled people who watched the animation did like him as a character.

We also have The Hunchback of Notredame to add on this list: both the original and Disney's version show Frollo as what one could even consider a show of MRA line of thinking: he mistreats Esmeralda hoping that she somehow ends up falling in love for him, tries to dread her by the typical "do what I want *or else...*" and, in a MGTOW fashion, blames her for his own problems. Focusing solely on the Disney version here: both the Hunchback and Phoebus loved her, too, and none had the urges and apparent lack of self control like Frollo did. Her beauty and carefreeness does not justify his actions like he tries to convince himself that do.

On a more recent note, we also have Maui from the Moana (or Vaiana) movie. He starts off with the exact feeling manospherians often have of entitlement and "I did this, you should thank me!" when, in fact, there are things of which he wasn't responsible at all but takes the credit. And do I need to mention his disbelief around the fact that the Ocean chose a girl at first, and how he blatantly stated that she probably should be on her village "taking care of the babies or something"? Fortunately, he does change and is not the villain (probably the reason why he changed, though), seeing he was wrong - also about stealing Te Fiti's heart. On a personal level, I wouldn't put him on this list considering the possibility that he'd act on such way with any human being in general, but you get the point here.

Lastly, we have Atlantis. The main character, Milo - fortunately for us, not Yannopoulos -, is a complete beta according to redpill definition. And adorkable, according to TvTropes. Yet, he's seen as a lovable and well built character in general, including by me, who's writing this wall of text for some reason. Oh, and do I have to talk about that Mole faced guy? It's a pretty general consensus that his flirt attempts were funny, but realistically they'd probably be creepy, too. Still, he's a good step above the typical manospherian as he still holds some respect for women and sees them as humans.

As the final point of this text, I can actually contest the concept of "Disney lying to men". Especially if, considering how most of the fantasy based, romanticized animations are focused mostly on the feminine public - and yet, the women who do complain of men are aware of how unrealistic Disney princes were and do not accuse it of lying to them about reality. They knew right from the beginning it was just fantasy and fictional. Accusing things made for *children* to be delusional when it leaves obvious remarks about how it's all fantasy *is*, on itself, delusional; something must be really out of place to think it's realistic after growing up.

I am aware that the first part was done from anecdotal evidence from her grandmother + evidence on the Immigration Museum on So Paulo (they can help you with Italian ancestors. Actually, with Japanese, too, but I have none, so :P).

As for the wage gap, maybe it's not very noticeable where you live, but here it's pretty easy to notice.

But anyway, if you don't really feel like you *love* her, I think you'd better be honest with her and not "lead her on" on her attraction.

Tell her the truth.

EDIT: oh, and if needed, do take some time to yourself to think more deeply about the situation. That'd probably also give her some time, too.

<TEXT> I went there two years ago to laugh a bit from times to times.

6 months later I started to dislike it because it was turning pretty much into facebook but cringier (I mean, I do have an account on facebook, but at least I can avoid the cringe; on 9gag, cringe was the entire first page) and with more reposts than daily Reddit. I saw the posts of the kind you mentioned, and back then, I didn't mind them at all. I can say for once that I agreed with some of them because the "THEY are like that, I'm different" kind of thought came up lots of times on my mind.

Then, I decided to finally leave 9gag after a video that made me unconfortable had a bunch of comments bashing the girl on it -- and mind you, I was still transitioning, so the thing was *really* bad to have me reacting like that --. I don't really remember a lot of it, but heh, I tend to completely forget things that make me feel extremely bad.

It was probably the best choice I could've taken. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A woman (...) expects that you're going to say everything SHE wants to hear.

First off, one thing I noticed happening the most are women who hate guys who act normal around his friends and suddenly change around her because "she's a woman, you can't be yourself around one". It's not even that she expect people around her to act the way she wants, it's just that it gets tiring after some time to notice men feeling at ease around his friends while being a non-interactive rock close to women *simply because HE thinks women wouldn't like him the way he is*. I can say for myself: I had a bunch of guys act the way they were around each other with me; it was the best thing possible and I laughed along with them. But you know what people said about that? That "they were interested on me" (they were not), that I was "their bitch", that they were "acting incorrectly around a woman" because you're not supposed to just be yourself around the opposite gender apparently... and to my side, the list is waaaaaaay longer. The amount of people trying to force me the idea that I was being a slut or shouldn't be talking with men was high. Also, the things they said were even worse than the ones I mentioned there, and most involved the idea that I was going to turn into a whore even though I didn't sleep/have a relationship with any of them.

Social norms are what makes it that way, not "women" wanting you to be the way you want or "men" applying filters. If you notice the amount of people who feel odd at seeing men and women being themselves around each other here instead of following these norms, you'll get why it happens. It's not the girl who approached you who's at fault here; it's those who teach that. And it's not only women who teach that; in fact, I've seen more men keeping this ideology flowing than women.

Ah, and just to let you know: nobody really feels at ease when meeting someone new. Everyone tries to present themselves while not being an open book, so if that's what you mean by "filter", everyone has it. The problem is when this filter makes you be someone completely different like you're saying there. </TEXT>

They generally tend to not care mostly (or act like they don't but actually do), but they're also the ones who have homophobic tendencies unironically.

Trust me, I have a friend who's on the equivalent of High School here.

In fact, some of the people who do that and are told to "hide" the kid's gender will often lie to the father about "not being able to see the gender of the baby" if they ask on such occasions. My mother's side of the family had a bunch of women doing that; my grand-uncle, as an example, always viewed girls in a not-so-great light, as well as people with physical disabilities... and his second child was a girl with a defficiency on her legs and hips.

<TEXT> It's funny to read that, 'cause here it's the other way around when it comes to "libtard families/rightist kid": the most common set is right leaning families with a liberal kid suffering around that. I personally can fit into that description if you take the general position of my aunts and such, although I wouldn't call myself liberal (I'd say I'm more of *"can we just be hoomans and act as such"* line of thought, and my grandmother had a similar view... though she was pretty harsh with words, but eh, she was considered "out of her mind" back then if you take into consideration that she was born on 1934).

Either way, it's odd how different it is; while here a good 3/4 will boo you and call you a ton of names if you show a different view about gender roles (including, that woman who was punched in the face recently was being accused here and comments of the "she must have done something to deserve that, she's at guilt for that", "save that video/gif, it's not everyday we see equality about men and women" were thrown around like the most common thing in the world... and when a guy called the man who punched her a coward, everyone went to "call him out" on that and said it was "equality" to let her go through that) and such, where these guys live is the other way around. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As some of you probably saw before (and being fair, it appeared on News on both the Left and Right), on recent years more men started to agree on the "housewife + sole breadwinner husband" mentality along with the lines of "feeling emasculated by [thing]" appearing more. I mean, the studies shown on the News tend to show a sudden modification on the "criteria" cited (ie 1980-2000 there was a drop on the mentality mentioned along with a "broader" sense of masculinity when it came down to what was neutral/seen as not important to a "manly being", but then a sudden raise on 2000-2010ies and quick general changes), but still, where does that come from?

I've seen people pointing out that the "rise of the Right" brought that, but if it's rising and bringing these things along, where did this *rise* come from and why? Also, why inferiority complex went on a high again considering how the same people cited above started to feel intimidated by "independent women"?



Sidenote: by "masculinity" there I meant the general concept of Western nations, although some noticeable changes happened on the East too. Unfortunately, I cannot talk much about the East as I'm not exactly there nor see much about them generally speaking, but if you want to bring me a light about the East, too, I'll happily accept. ~The more you know~, right? </TEXT>

I know. That's also why I'd feel bothered considering that it was a complete stranger.

EDIT to add a few more stuff: my family and close friends don't have the "staring at you to show they're interested" kind of tactic. It's more of a "look at you a few times here and there between something else" because it can get *extremely* awkward. And to have me not feeling awkward over something like that, you'd have to live with me pretty much since I was born, so yeah, the only person that doesn't get me freaking out if they do that is *my mother*. I'm not exactly what you'd call common in that regard, I admit, but a freaky past and an entire life on the a dangerous and biggest city of your country (with over 10 million inhabitants) can do that.

Also, if a fucker I just met few minutes ago started to touch me, I'd probably back the fuck off and find a route to run away. If there's one thing I feel extremely bothered by, that'd be strangers touching me. Long story. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ey, sorry for the wait, it'll probably be a long reply (even though I can't remember every single detail) so I left it for later.

Right at the beginning of the relationship he actually felt happy that I wanted to work and all, but during his transition he tried to force the idea on me that I *needed* to be a housewife because "if you happen to have kids, they'll need a parent and your husband has to work". I mean, why does it need to be *me*? Also, personal experience here: one of my professors had a child recently; the first 6 months his wife took care of the kid. Now he's doing that so she'll be able to work on her common timing and while he's away she takes care of the kid as she finished the work for the day. It's just organization, not "ah, you'll have to give up your childhood dream because of children". I even blatantly told him that if there's one thing I wanted since I was 4, that'd be working. And now that I began, I can say for sure that I enjoy that. A lot. I probably was born to be an angry working class lass :v

Ah, and he did try to convince me to let my hair grow again. Not on an obvious manner, but by "boasting" a lot about it and "negging" around my actual cut (messy short cut. Nicknamed by a friendo of mine as "Liam Gallagher's SOTSOG cut", LOL). I didn't realize the negging at first... until he blurted out that I "didn't look very feminine". Then I just said I didn't care.

He'd often ask for full body pictures (not nudes because I left it obvious right from the beginning that I didn't send these because I didn't trust the internet) while he himself wouldn't send many of these. In a way, I like to think he was just shy around that, but I still have this gut feeling that he felt like it was a chore I *had* to do, so this point is not a "100% proven" one.

He'd boast about masculinity *a lot*. He'd often say the Romans and Greek (Athens) had the true perception around masculinity and that the "new one was lost". That point also went to the second part about the "women feeling entitled to what men had" and the first one: he saw working women as "huge turn offs" and as "trying to be men" (which, for him, meant that they were neglecting their true nature and "turning into monkeys"), that those who didn't have children were neglecting their true nature of "nurturers"... ehh long list you'll get tired of reading. To him, society started to fall after the Roman Empire fell, but boasted around the "castes" of Middle Age.

Anyway, as a final point 'cause I can't remember more for now (but if I do, I'll add on an EDIT), he'd also try to convince me to sexual stuff that were huge "no"s to me for a long time already. </TEXT>

The "reality show" that's currently happening right now also removed one of its competitors because he hit his then-girlfriend this week.

<TEXT> So, since I ended my last relationship I've been wondering what my partner could've meant by that and still didn't get to a complete conclusion.

On one of our talks (which later became an argument, but that's not important) when he was transitioning to Terp-mode, he said he liked the fact that I'd like to share the restaurant bills and such instead of letting him pay for everything 'cause he surely met lots of women who didn't, calling that fact by "bad side of princess culture".

He said the bad side of "princess culture" was "women thinking they were entitled to everything men had" (making them pay for everything along with other stuff I later asked that proved his transition *and thus ended up in an argument*, but I'll keep the details because it still leaves me pretty amazed in a not-so-good-way that someone would think this way), so... what the fuck would be the "good side" according to this mindset?

My father was born on the actual baby boom era, close to its end, and back then it was usual of families here have 5-8 children (in fact, his family was him, his twin brother, two other brothers and an older sister)... and surprise surprise: his father thought his only service was working and getting money to the family. One thing his father/my grandpa differed from him, though: grandpa didn't try to pose off as "man of the house" (ie "I OWN THIS SHIT AND YOU BETTER OBEY ME", but eh, grandma was an angry Italian with an abnormal strength to a 1,40-something m tall person as well, so it'd probably be a fight) and actually incentivated his wife to get a college degree (it was her dream since childhood). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah, he did cheat on my mother. Twice. In fact, they didn't talk to each other for two entire months whe she found out. We *knew* the entire thing but he still tried to pose off as innocent. As my mother herself said, it'd be less trouble if he simply said the truth instead of doing an entire mind gymnastics around it, LOL

And about the mental issues, I do agree, but he thinks these things aren't real. And well, about the financial thing... he's the least concerned. As I said there, he spends money on whatever if he feels like doing. Kind of compussive, in a way; I can say that from everyone on this house, my mom is the only who doesn't buy things in a "non rational" way. Can't truly speak for myself here 'cause everyone says about themselves that "they don't do that", but everyone says I'm a "closed fist" about money when it comes to myself.

Oh, and he tried to beat my mom before. Just doesn't do that anymore because my brother is a good 20 cm taller than him and stronger, and the few times my father tried to do that he came into the scene and didn't let him. My brother never got to the point of hitting him, he just immobilized and told him to back off *or else* he'd do something. My father once tried to strangle my mother, too. Her neck became tense and he didn't get to do it because it got so tense he couldn't stop her breath from coming and going.

Ah, and he tried raising his voice before but it didn't give any results. Is why I didn't mention anything of that regard there: the moment he noticed it would just make things worse for him, he stopped. I can say for once that, on a good side, he tried to be more patient and stop being so short tempered about these things, but eh, he gave up soon and there we are again: still short tempered as fuck.

Ah, about the rape: it happened on Rio, if I remember correctly. The girl was underaged; I don't remember her name, though, but I do remember that the police that took care of the case put the guys mostly as not guilty. Two or three went to jail only; on this case, can't really "point out" guilty ones other than these two because she was passed out when the other cases happened. They just knew because some people passed by and filmed/took pictures of her. Some even posted on social media (which, in fact, was were most of the proofs came from as she wasn't awake). </TEXT>

And yeah, we did try getting close to him to see if it was a "shy for interactions" thing, but it isn't; by the amount of friends he has and by what they themselves say, he's pretty extroverted when he's not with his family. Either way, other than him, we're all pretty chill :P </TEXT>

<TEXT> He doesn't work.

We're all unemployed.

Also, he *truly* seems himself as handsome. Not a joke. He does that with people outside the family, not with the family.

And no, no assumptions. He actually talked to my mother about these things.

Also, he's not "neglected". He doesn't even try to spend time with his family. We tried lots of times to be with him, but he shuts down all possibilities.

Anyway, my mom doesn't spend money on "worthless stuff". She's with the same clothes for over 10 years already, they look that age and he doesn't let her buy anything for herself. But when it comes to anyone else, he can spend up to 300 and not bat an eye. He doesn't really know how to spend money correctly; she does. She's stressed out and he's not giving a shit. He spends money worthlessly and then asks where it went and blames it on her even though she bought nothing but the basic. But you know, it's not like you'll believe it anyway.

And uh, I'm not from the US. Also, the girl I mentioned there: she wasn't walking naked, she was with two other guys. It started out as consensual but then she asked them to stop because it was hurting her and she got to the point of bleeding, but they didn't attend to her call and carried on. She passed out, they kept their thing going and, when done, they left her on the street. They were on a party if I remember correctly; the region they were was famous for being unsafe at night, and they left her with just her shirt on the street.

And uh, you know, I'm not a feminist... but whatever. Honestly, I don't even know why I'm trying to explain considering that you'll probably dismiss it.

EDIT: forgot to add: when he talked to my mom about the fact that he finds it odd that I'm not very emotive, he was trying to convince her to do something.

She simply stated that's what I am, I'm not a kid anymore. Am aware of that because she did mention it to me later on and tried to tell me to be less "neutral" around him, but honestly, even if I tried I can't. Especially because I have this "can't put my 'barriers' down" with him.

EDIT2: forgot to say: he has no dad humour. I think his share of dad humour went to my mom, 'cause holy shit if she doesn't make bad jokes everyday just to see her kids' reactions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In a way, I think he's paying for what he thinks for his entire life.

His mother was a feminist.

I was/am a "manly woman" on the androgynous sense (*Bowie intensifies*).

His niece also is a feminist...

... and his son was considered gay during his entire teens by his colleagues. So, yeah... </TEXT>

<TITLE> A Study on a TRPer </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-10 01:54:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I actually wrote this title and started to laugh my ass off for some reason, but anyway, some similarities I noticed on my father and TRPers behaviour and a bit of an explanation.

A few conclusions I had from a long time living with him:

- Whenever he has to do a home-related service, he'll procrastinate it the most he can and find a petty reason to argue and, in a temper tantrum, not do what he had to and be angry at everyone else on the house and pose as the victim. He can do that for up to an entire month.

- Run away from home when he feels "not respected". Respect, to him, includes not arguing with dumb as fuck ideas he has, not asking where he shoved the money he got in a small job (once again, we're all unemployed here... and guess what, I was the first to land a job on the house), not asking him to do any home service, leave EVERY FUCKIN' THING THAT IS RELATED TO THE KITCHEN DONE, let him eat as much as he wants (even though there are other people to eat, too), put him as priority... and also not ask with whom he was on the cellphone. He goes away to talk with other people on the cellphone.

- Humiliating his son and wife in front of his friends to pose off as manly alpha man of the house. Recently, he did that and everyone argued with him; tried to pose off as "stoic" during the discussion but was the most affected one... I mean, I blatantly showed him I was not giving a fuck anymore. Probably that's why he doesn't try doing that with me since I show to not give a fuck and end up answering back and making him look like the odd one. Really, he also does that with his friends from times to times and when I did that, most thanked me when he was away. *lol*

- He tries to push everyone to not be able to work so he'll be the sole breadwinner of the house. Once again, I was the first to land a job here; he felt... weird, to say the least. Tried to neg me out of it, but heh, back to the other point: I stopped giving a fuck.

- He sees himself as the most handsome human of the place *all the time*. He doesn't know some people actually snicker at that and just don't blatantly say at his face to not be rude. I firmly believe Twerps are in a similar regard.

- Thinks he's the "captain" of the house and, once again, tries to pose off this way in front of other people. People don't tell him, but they know he doesn't; it's my mother. He's a terrible leader and terrible admin. Also, when things got really bad here, he ran away and nothing really changed on the money front... apart from less money being spent because you know, he costs a lot.

- Expects his daughter (aka me) to be a sheepish expressive woman and close to him. He stays in front of the television almost 24/7 since I was 4, so I never had much contact with him. My brother was much more of a father than him and helped me to understand that I hadn't to be a "girly girl", just like he also didn't need to be a "manly man" like my father would often try to make us believe we should. Anyway: he finds it extremely odd that I am quite stoic emotionally. I just am not when I'm on a joking mood, but he never gets to experience them because I don't feel close to him and he knows it.

- Bases everyone's taste on their gender and generalizes people into "dualistic boxes": a man cannot be anything else but what he thinks a man is (in fact, a coworker of his former job was called a "pussy" by him because he didn't fight back when a guy stole the meat of his food but was pretty chill about it) and nor a woman.

- Negs his wife and thinks everything she tries to spend on herself is expensive. That includes 10 bucks. My mom felt like she was the ugliest creature because of this behaviour of his, but after some time she noticed it wasn't true and whenever he tries to put her down, she answers back. Still can't get to spend money on herself, but eh, that's actually also an old habit of hers back from when she still lived with her mother and they were the money that entered the house; also, she's the youngest child of a bunch of 3, so she never got to experience what the other two had and was pretty neglected on that side.

- He ran away when my mom had a deadly disease. *300 km away*. When he was sick, he expected all of us to be there, though. He sees the position of my mom of "being there for him" as an obligation, but he has none to hers.

- Blatantly blamed a rape victim of being the one that caused it because she was in "scatty clothing" and started off as something with consent. More on detail: she asked her rapists to stop when it started to hurt, they didn't, they made her pass out... and over 20 people raped her as they left her on the street without her underwear, skirt and with her "ass high on the air". It was nighttime.





And... that's all I can remember for now. I just know that it feels odd to live with someone like this. Especially when you're a woman and *his daughter*. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not really all of them. I think some, if not most (which would be unfortunate, though) are just easily manipulated. From one side they just believe the words of a certain side (their male peers) and on the other think the world is "falling down to pieces", so, believing RP gets easy with these two aspects.

I once mentioned that my second partner had a smaller mental issue, right? It was nothing major; what influenced him was the thought that "the world was falling down" and believing the world would be better if we got back to a "caste" system... and the second one was the one that took him to believe women were inferior. Also, we had a decent age gap, so whenever I argued with him about these things he'd just say I was "being manipulated" or that I am "too young to understand". Nothing conected to his mental issue, *he* was the problem by letting himself be led by the mind of other "alphas".

Unfortunately, I can't even say this is unique to TRPers/MGTOW/Incels; it happens everywhere. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Money

My two partners were way more broke than me and I didn't give a shit. I'd share the restaurant bills with the second and didn't let him buy "emotional stuff" to me (read that as bouquets) because I'd forget to take care of them and it'd be money badly spent taking that into consideration. In fact, if there was one thing I told him, that thing was to spend his money on himself and I'd be happy if he was happy with his purchases.



Status

Once again, *more broke than me*. And the second was diagnosed with a small mental disorder when he was younger, so, yeah, I'd say that would "take his status off" according to TRP. Also, I just made sure he wasn't into an illegal scheme of sorts and we were fine. Two broke people hanging around.



Looks

LOL, you know, I never really had a "pattern" for what I like, right? One was short and chubby with a fluffy black hair and a beta calming aura and the other was slender (with some amazing hips, must say) and tall as heck. Also, I cared more about their personality, so the fact that they were extraordinary human beings before turning to a terpy-like side made them seem like the most beautiful human beings on Earth to me.

That is, after Ewan McGregor. Nobody beats Ewan McGregor when he had that magnific beard.



Resources and properties

Two. Broke. People. I live with my parents (common around here because the economy is fucked up). The second lived in a small apartment that took him years to buy. The first also lived with his parents.



Fame

lol OH LOL. Why the fuck would I want to date a famous fella, monsieur Terpois? Me no likes pictures taken of me.



Attention

Well, yeah. They also wanted my attention, so, fair trade innit?



Protection

Uhhhhh no. We lived far from each other and if there's one thing I learned to be since a kid, that'd be a fembloke ready to bust a jaw with my fists at any second if someone tried to force me into a bad situation. I'll die but not without fighting.

<TEXT> Yeah, I am aware of these things. But the kind of pressure they put on me was quite different. My family itself not so much (except my father) but those around me, yeah. I can say for once that I feel uneasy about myself partially because of this problem -- because I wasn't "girly like my schoolmates were", I was poked fun at lots of times. And adults put pressure on me, too. Now that I'm older I don't care, but when you're a kid, things are completely different...

EDIT: putting more detail into this:

When I was around 9, every other girl of my class already started wearing makeup. I mean, *really*. And I never were into that, so the guys of the class would get into a big group to mock me around because I was a "boy"; not only because of that, I admit, but also because on the time everyone tried to go to school wearing skirts and you're the only one who isn't, of course they'll always find something to say about.

I liked Math way more than everyone else. There was a guy who legit told me to stop liking it because it wasn't a "girl's thing".

My schoolmates never allowed me to help them because "it wasn't womanly to carry weight", even if the bunch of guys they called weren't being able to carry it alone and would need help.

Adults often tried to force me the idea that I needed to be a "delicate little flower" (read that as "emotional kid who plays with dolls". Literally, not even faking it here) even if I showed right from the start that I wasn't into that and being "emotive" wasn't really part of my nature. I always had trouble expressing myself, it's nobody's fault in this case.

People tried to force me to wear things I wasn't comfortable with because otherwise I "looked like a man", even if it was obvious on pictures that it made no difference.

People tried to teach me to not talk my sincere thoughts even if they ask for it. Funny enough, the same people said it was "normal" of their male children to do that because "it's in their nature".

As for my friend...

His mother wants him to be your typical "pumper and dumper" of women. Like, she's literally trying to teach him that this is right, and he can't help but feel uneasy. He doesn't get why she'd like to teach him that.

He wants to take care of his skin problem and would like to remove some of his body hair because, as he says, it makes him smell and it bothers him even outside that. His mom doesn't let him do that because "it's gay".

His colleagues try to push him to women but he *can't* fall in love with anyone. I'd say he's asexual considering the overall, and because of that, they always poke fun at him saying that he's a little bitch, homosexual and all that stuff we're tired of. They try to make him get angry and fight them (yeah, "FITE ME IRL" but not so meme-y) for no reason because "it's not manly to be so calm and not want to punch stuff", apparently. Also, whenever he shows a "not macho" behaviour (macho culture is at its peak here, and you can be poked fun at for *simply going to the market with your mother*) they'll make entire hoaxes of him and avoid him like he's some degenerate with a plague or something.

Oh, and we both also suffered with the "this is not a job for men/women, choose something else" and the "being (insert trait here) is not manly/womanly" a lot. I for once was called "lesbian" on school for 4 entire years because 1. I wasn't the stereotypical girly and 2. I rejected the "most desired guy" of the school.

There are even more things I can't think of, so yeah, we had problems. I am glad you don't have to deal with them, and I congratulate you for that, but I've seen lots of people who did and they felt sad and desperate because they "weren't following a role they're supposed to", and it saddens me. I don't have this "plurigender" thought, but I honestly can't see why should *individuals* fit into a pre defined role that doesn't catch all the possibilities inside the variety of human beings. I don't blame people who'd like to follow that; hell, if they feel like they fit it, go for it, I'm happy that it works for them. But don't think it works everywhere because it truly doesn't. Just teach kids to be responsible *and* humane, not "manly" or "womanly". If they have these traits, they tend to show them from an early age; I know it's odd, but really, most people I met already had lots of traits defined from an early age, including myself (this one I just had proof from events my mom remembered, like when I was 5 and people tried to push me to do something and argued a ton of reasons why it was "good" but I simply refused and didn't back off), my brother, this friend... I just think good things, like being caring and educate from one side and being assertive enough to not let him/herself be left behind should be teached everywhere.

Annnnd sorry for the long post. I got carried away here... </TEXT>

Generally, it was by their own mothers just like with you :I I honestly don't get it, but eh, my parents were young when they had my brother anyway (my father was my mom's first boyfriend and he got her pregnant at 17), so I guess that plays a big role on my views as well. </TEXT>

not married

So...? It's extremely common around here. This country is traditional as fuck and has the biggest Catholic population of the world and yet it's getting extremely rare to have someone telling a guy to marry soon.

Wymeen, on the other hand... they don't exactly tell you to marry soon, *but bloody hell if they don't try to make our greatest life focus be "getting a boyfriend"*. There's even the "annoying aunt" trope here which literally consists of that aunt you see once a year and always asks "what about your boyfriends?/did you get a boyfriend yet?/ you need to get a boyfriend or else you'll end up like [person]" and yadda yadda yadda... </TEXT>

The other was all about having me on the dominant position until he TRPed and went on to say that having me as dominant "emasculated" him.

So yeah, double standard is still a bitch, but it's funny that it's mostly men themselves that create it on both sides: tell women that they want to be oppressed on one, and on another make fun of men and tell 'em to "man up" about that because it's *oh so unnatural to have a man as sub*... and I seriously don't get why they put it that way.

Not saying that there aren't women doing the same, but from what I've seen, most of the time it's guys themselves and it's depressing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been going through that for quite some time already, and eh, for a good amount of time I thought there was something wrong with me instead of them... and pretty much opressed myself from the inside 'cause I thought, "you aren't acting like you're supposed to, you useless twat"; fortunately, that changed.

Anyway, the only two guys I ever loved turned to that side as well; started off as "beta"s, which I liked a lot because I felt like I could share my life with them and they could share theirs with me, too, and I loved helping them when they needed, but in a small amount of time they turned into "alpha men" and I just felt like running away. Yeah, it often felt like a hard decision because I still liked them, but eh, the moment I noticed I loved the way they were before and it was gone I just ended it. I lost a bunch of male friends as well because of that, too; when I was a kid, I just stayed with the boys 'cause I felt more carefree to do what I liked around them (old "but you're a girl, you're not supposed to do that!" on the other side from colleagues *and* adults), but as we grew, I just slowly got away from them because of that tendency... and it's sad that it's happening. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, I don't even feel like it'd be great to let something go inside me. It actually makes me even a bit uneasy, to be fair, but I can't even say it's trauma because I don't remember anything that happened when I was younger that was even remotely close to that.

Also, it's been some time that I went to a gynecologist, as I said there. That's especially because I want to freak out whenever I go to one... and think along with me here: if I feel uneasy of even showing my legs off/wearing dresses, just imagine what actually showing my ladybits to a complete stranger feels like. </TEXT>

I mean, women are all self centered Machiavellian harpies with venomous views about men... and yet they all drop their panties on the floor if they see an "alpha dick" 'cause that's all life's about for a woman.

Uh.

And completely despises TRP as a whole to add to the bunch :v

LOL, glad for the offer, but I've never been into makeup :P it's not even that nobody wanted to teach me, it's just me that never enjoyed it because it felt odd on my skin for some reason. Still, I also hope you're alright there and that you'll find someone who needs a new lipstick, too :P </TEXT>

<TEXT> First of all, nobody has to read my last post. In a TL;DR: dated a traditionalist, felt like I was being chained down, broke up, decided to vent here because I know this is the only place guys won't come up to ostracize me by taking an actual right choice. He himself said he wouldn't change, so yeah, I don't want "relationship experts" telling me to try changing him if he doesn't want to. Also, it doesn't work if the person still thinks the same way but doesn't show it.

ANYWAY. A special thanks for u/thelastpear. Really, I'm grateful as fuck for your message and it did help me a lot to know that good people still exist ('cause you know, I like to think people are still good but it's hard when I deal with dickheads everyday), and a thanks for all of you for comprehending. For real. And I have to admit that I used this time out of that relationship to actually put my mind to some use on... STEM. Yeah, that area Terpers say women are bad at. I luv eet.

And I admit I was bitter about the guy's view, indeed. Which was the main reason why I decided to do a lot of searches that proved his point wrong. Turns out I was right, though a certain one is more personal (like the fact that I don't think personalities are "feminine/masculine" or that inborn natures truly exist) considering that I used a personal example... which is my mother's side of the family and my brother himself. I mean, he's the greatest nurturer I ever met when it comes to children, and I'm just a floppy pile of carbon-based life who can't word my feelings like women "should" do. Personal problem, yeah, never been an expressive person, but it's not like people teached me to be that way.

Either way, thanks a lot, TBP. Even if you didn't say anything directly to me, the fact that people like y'all exist is already a motivational to me. It's good to know that I don't stand alone about these things. </TEXT>
