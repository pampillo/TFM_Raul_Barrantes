<TEXT> Man those spinning LED toys were brilliant. I think basically everything I got from Santa was essentially as piece of plastic with an LED light and *if you were lucky* it made a sound.

More than that, a big cardboard box and a couple of fairy liquid bottles and I'd be sorted. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you're probably right. I imagine that most teens who are obese are so from a young enough age. However, and this is only anecdotal so it proves nothing, I see about 5% of our first years who have come in rather healthy looking and gain a lot of weight by 6th year. But that's just anecdotal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> How do we educate them? I completely agree with you but people say "This should be taught in schools" when schools already does plenty on this. And to be fair, these healthy eating programs etc largely do nothing if they go home and their family life does not promote healthy eating. Healthy eating is decided at home by parents. Making healthy foods more accessible and attractive to parents should be a priority. 

I'm not blaming parents. I just think that fast food and unhealthy options are allowed too much room to look attractive and "easy" to families and the government does little to deal with corporations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is a difficult question to answer. I guess it comes down to your own convictions and what you believe is right. I believe that whether a person is good or bad has nothing to do with membership of an organisation, a person's morality is a complex thing that is always evolving.

Like you, I would like to see a point where these groups are entirely separate from the state. I think that could only go to benefit the people, as well as the church and state themselves. No good is coming from the current situation. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  This had nothing to do with Catholicism but is simply something that happens in poor societies. 

I don't know if i fully agree there. Yes, there is truth in that but the Catholic system (along with many other religions) allowed for this to go on. I don't think abuse and Catholicism go hand in hand but the Church was the body that largely oversaw this abuse and I don't think it had nothing to do with them.

 the Irish Catholic Church was a reflection of the values of the time. 

I agree, but again they were part of a larger body who we now know knew (say that ten times) about it. I agree it isn't right to lump it all on the church because that lets a lot of other bad people off the hook, but I don't agree that it has nothing to do with the organisation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is merit to what you're saying, and the Church has clearly done something to anger you and you're entitled to that. But I think there needs to be a separation between what is the Church as an institution and the individual. There are people working in the organisation, maybe only a small amount, that have done good for people because they are kind, hard working people, not necessarily because they are in the church itself. </TEXT>

*Irish actor, yep.*

*Irish actor, I apologise.*

*Ireland, Ireland. I thought that was the same thing, apparently not.*

*It is most certainly not.*

<TEXT> I was at a wave pool with family and went to the bathroom before the wave machine turned on. When I came back out, everyone in the pool was watching their kids in the water making sure they were safe. However, at the other end of the pool in no more than a foot of water was a kid that nobody saw, on his back having an epileptic seizure under the water.

I ran and grabbed him to pull him out. The pool hall was incredibly loud and so I found myself shouting for about 2 minutes straight trying to get the attention of someone. Eventually another kid turned around and grabbed a life guard who then resuscitated the kid. In the end he was taken away by an ambulance but he was ok. </TEXT>

Ive noticed of late his reluctance to comment as much on trivial matters (as opposed to when he was in sport and would offer opinions on anything but) It must be for that reason. He's in with a good chance at this point I would imagine. </TEXT>

From the UESP. So yeah you're right. Basically if you are caught with the armor the Ordinators essentially place a lifetime bounty on your head. Pretty rough. But only if you talk to them it seems. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Indoril Armor: A concept more beautiful than its design. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-03 23:56:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ever since I first stepped foot in Vivec, I longed to own a set of Indoril Armor. It was magnificent, strong but not to heavy, and medium armor was always my favorite armor class. And it was beautiful, Christ I don't think I have ever admired a set of Game armor since.

But what struck me most was the fact that I couldn't have it.

You couldn't buy it because it was for guards only. But I found a set in the temple so all was well. But I was attacked each time I put it on. This beautiful armor I couldn't have.

So I made it my mission to get it. I was going to walk around the cantons wearing a full set of Indoril and no one was going to stop me. There just had to be a way of joining, a way to legitimise the ownership and use in front of Vivec Guards. But no. After spending weeks completing every Vivec related quest I still came up empty handed.

And that's when it struck me. 

The armor was designed to be forbidden. It was never intended to be allowed. Outside of cheating you can't wear a set of the armor legitimately within Vivec without incurring the wrath of the guards. Sure you could wear it outside but never within.

It was a moment of gaming genius. Concept design at its most brilliant. Here we have a set of armor, beautiful as it may be, that your character is not allowed to wear. No tricks. No quests. No "complete these missions and you shall be rewarded". Just no.

Because this was a part of the world you are in. These are the rules. To be immersed in a place where you must accept the laws. The armor wasn't designed to act as another tier on the scale, it was a holy set of armor and our character did not deserve it. There was nothing more immersive than that. 

The developers were clear on this one. This is our world. This is our story.

<TEXT> We all have bias.

Recently a US soldier was killed by "Friendly Fire". I would say an American soldier shot and killed another American soldier. They both mean the same thing, but I simply see it slightly different. I'm not misleading anyone and my bias is clear enough for someone else to say "You know what, I agree/disagree with that terminology".

The problem lies in stuff like "Travellers cause riot in streets of Dublin" and then show footage of a completely unrelated event. Or repeated articles lambasting one political party and never saying anything negative about another.

I'm smart enough to know to look for alternative sources but if all I hear from major news broadcasters is X, I don't think I can say that I would be *entirely* immune to it.

And not everyone is able to make that decision. Why shouldn't people trust a national paper? Why should I doubt it? It looks legit, maybe the tabloids will pull my leg but a broadsheet? Nah...

It's not fair to assume people won't be influenced. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't believe there is true objectivity in any sense of the word. But there are differences between different media outlets on the larger scale in terms of bias. 

I know that some journalists and editors will have certain preferences and agendas, we all do, but Im just wondering whether there is any significant spectrum between the various media outlets in the country regarding bias the way there would be in other countries. </TEXT>

<TEXT> *You guys!*

Seriously, either way I think the big difference is who the main protagonist is in the Oblivion story vs Skyrim.

If Dragonborn dies (yes there is speculation that there are others but you're the only one who is aware of it) the realm is done for.[citation needed]

If the hero of Kvatch dies im sure the blades could find someone else. I mean, it is *their job* to protect the heir. If Martin were to die during the main quest then Cyrodil is done for.[citation needed] </TEXT>

For me in Oblivion it was exactly that, you could have been anyone, that's the problem for me, not that it actually is a problem. It's a preference thing. </TEXT>

I for one loved the challenge of exploring the landscape.

<TEXT> I think the premise behind the main story, as a Dragonborn, is better than Oblivion yes. I think the individual execution of the quests in Skyrim though, main quest included, are tedious. While I found Oblivion's main quest less interesting, I thought the implementation of the quests was quite good. If the main quest story in Skyrim was implemented better I would be happier.

Essentially I'm coming from a "Chosen One" preference like Morrowind, I felt that in Oblivion you were more like "the chosen one's chosen one" but I know that's my own bias. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think you were antagonistic, your criticism was good, doesn't make you a dick.

Regarding Martin Septim, I guess my issue is that he is still the one who saves the day. I take your point about the Hero of Kvatch being the one who saves him. The role is definitely not futile. It's simply a case of preference for me that you spend so much time saving him as opposed to having a more central role like the other games.

Regarding Magic, I don't think I clarified my point because what you said was right too. I simply meant that the power/cost of magic is better, you can play as a straight mage in Skyrim without finding it impossibly tedious.

They stripped away more spells and an entire school. To be honest I don't particularly enjoy magic in either games. I think Morrowind had it right. Oblivion's magic, while varied, is impossibly hard to use at high levels without amassing a huge amount of fortify magika items and spells. And playing as a true mage (while fun much more fun) is very challenging because of this. Whereas, in my opinion, you can play as a straight mage in Skyrim and not find it impossible past level 15, the power balance is back.

Regarding the quests, I agree. My main point above was that the quests in Skyrim were less exciting than oblivion. Getting to be arch mage in Oblivion took time and effort and above all else it was fun.

At the end of the day I find myself comparing everything to Morrowind. That's probably not fair of me to do but I don't think Magic or quest depth has come close since. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Skyrim makes up for what Oblivion lacked but the opposite is also true. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-28 00:38:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's pointless to offer critcism of Oblivion for its flaws at this stage because it has all been said before, although I still regard the game highly. I believe that, where it failed, Skyrim specifically makes up for.

Instead of a main character who merely facilitates the success of the real hero "Martin", you play a Dragonborn and take center stage in the story. The leveling system with enemies is lot fairer once more. Magic has a much more primary role. The main story itself is a lot more enthralling. The landscape is unique and well designed.

However, Skyrim is not without its flaws. Where it fails, I think we can look to oblivion for clarity.

The dungeons are far too repetitive, there are only 3 or 4 individual styles that don't change very much as you continue to explore. Oblivion, while still repeating similar styles of dungeon, offers a more varied layout. While the theme of Umbra's dungeon is used repeatedly, the specific layout is unique, especially the floor trap design.

So much effort was spent creating unique NPCs that their stories don't go far beyond that. Most  unique quests offer little more than delivering something across town or kill the bandit in that cave. In Oblivion, when you had to run a small errand, you can be sure something weird was just around the corner. Retrieving the ancestral sword, reuniting and liberating the home of the brothers etc. Granted they were wacky at times but every side quest felt like the most important job you had to do. I would offer that the side quest were better designed than the main quest but... *walks away whistling*.

Finally, while I understand Skyrim is MEANT to a divided province, there is little cohesion between anything outside of a town. The lack if cross city guilds plays a big part in this. As a result, each town tries to offer its own variety of quest which just ends up the same as the others. In Oblivion, the thieves guild took you everywhere, into the heart of the political sphere. Each faction forced you across every part of the world and gave you an extra piece of a puzzle that eventually fit together as one piece. Essentially the quests were fun. Silly, but fun.

I Ioved both games but I hope time will be a bit more even handed with them than modern criticism seems to be.

**Edit: On "Magic has a much more primary role".**

*What I intended by this comment was that I felt Magic was a much more effective and balanced power than in Oblivion. Where I feel that playing a straight mage in Oblivion is tediously difficult, requiring a massive amount of fortify Magika to cast top tier skills, requiring a lot of Magika for relatively ordinary spells etc. In Skyrim it's more possible to play as a straight Mage.*

*That being said, what you're left with in terms of Magic in TES:V is a very diluted version of magic, an entire school being abolished among other problems. I recognize the flaws on both sides (hence my argument) but my main point here is simply about the feasibility of using magic in Skyrim.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not an accountant so I'm ready for someone better equipped to jump in and correct me.

But you don't get tax back for not working over summer. You can claim tax back every year regardless of who you are. It's important to do it as a teacher who doesn't get summer pay because you've probably been on emergency tax for some of the schools you subbed in. Happens to me all the time.

You should start to claim tax back around this time of year because you should get it by summer. Also you get holiday pay if you've subbed in one school for a long time but you'd have already gotten that by now. </TEXT>

Officially the superintendents are selected but many schools need support for special centers so ide ask your local schools and let them know you're available for that for the exams. You might have a bit more time with exam corrections.

Alternatively run a summer grinds course. Advertise it as intensive exam preparation. I don't do it myself but I've seen it advertised from time to time. </TEXT>

What I would like is to be notified each time there is (in order of importance in case not everything is achievable)

1) A new submission
2) Any report whatsoever
3) A comment

This may seem extreme but it is for a small community. I borrowed this code from an older post, automod saves it but nothing happens. This may seem stupid but do I need to edit anything in the line "modmail: New {{kind}} in /r/{{subreddit}}. Link  {{permalink}}" specific to my subreddit or leave it?

<TEXT> Hi there, you came to the right place.

1) I'm assuming you did higher level maths for the LC as well as physics? Yes that should be more than fine for both subjects. You'll have to make sure that your course is recognised by the teaching council to teach those subjects. Sounds like they will but you should check the .pdf "teaching council curricular subject requirements" for yours to be sure, just google that. As long as you're competent your skill won't be an issue, it's just a matter of getting to know  the curriculum.

2) No. God no. I would say here, before I go any further, to consider why you want to go into teaching. Do you like working with kids? Do you like teaching? If yes to both then thats good. Your salary starting off on a contract won't be that. And that's if you get a contract. You'll most likely be subbing for 3 years maybe 5 (I know people who have subbed longer it's tough sometimes) but you could be lucky. You might be looking at 25k or a lot less depending on how much you work. That kind of salary takes a while, I'm not on that yet.

3) The one thing I'll say is make yourself useful. Make yourself an asset. Have stuff on your CV they can use, maths and IT are good for that, after languages they're probably the more sought after subjects. Learn up on the competitions in your subject areas, Maths Olympics, anything in programming, the lego league etc. 

But you need to like working with kids. It sounds obvious but I've met so many people go into the profession because of a love of their subject but couldn't handle teenagers and their attitudes.

You sound like you have a good job at the moment with a better salary than most new teachers. Before you make a big decision consider that. And feel.free to ask if you have any more questions. Best of luck pal! </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are right indeed. These figures are not necessarily misleading but they're meaningless when put beside our cost of living. Yes the pay is higher compared to other countries bit that's merely one metric. I doubt teachers in any European country are paid and exorbitant amount compared to cost of living.

And as you said, I don't think the work hours are taken into consideration. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We don't much sun in Ireland but lately the weather's picked up and I'm a bit concerned about our Whippet. I've read that it's recommended to use sunscreen for children or sensitive skin (anything that doesn't have zinc oxide). We have used a bit on her but she got a little burn the last day while out at the beach. I'm not really sure how much, how often or where to spray. Have you any advice regarding this and your whippets? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with you there. I think this archaic, militant approach isn't really helping anyone. It wont encourage Catholics to be better in their practices and it unfairly makes non religious people think poorly of the religious in our society. I'm not religious myself but I think it's incredibly unfair how individuals that are openly, proudly catholic are treated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Absolutely. It's very out of date. My experience of this is B.O.M. blaming a lack of resources for not being able to provide for these students and parents that don't want their children to opt out. But it's simply an excuse so that they don't have to accommodate anyone that has a different set of beliefs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my career as a teacher I have found that those who are pushing for students to attend mass are not doing it for the good of the students but for their reputation. Unfortunately anyone can derail the student-centered agenda.

I have listened to overtly religious colleagues and school management belittle students and their parents for not practicing, students pressured into going to mass and taking communion when they really don't want to. 

I've sat in on meetings about school trips where parents changed an entire day's schedule around finding a catholic church for the students to attend mass because they felt it was a Catholic School and their children should attend mass. The staff didn't want this because there were activities planned out but management caved in. No one asked the students however.

There are people on both sides, parents and teachers, who are only out to further reputation and social standing. A minority, I hope, that put their own needs above the children. It's awful because it gives a bad name to Religious people who by and large are lovely normal people like everyone else.

The ethos in each school varies. I have taught in CEIST schools that could have been completely secular for all you would know. Religion teachers that were honest and open. I've also taught in places that were run like a prison. But I believe choice in where we can send our kids in the future, Educate Together etc. will ultimately benefit the kids. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't quite know where I stand on the easter revision course. Ultimately anything that benefits the student is good. Students that have missed out on a lot of material, for whatever reason, have an opportunity to catch up without the burden of the teacher having to print off reams of notes for one person. However many of my colleagues disagree.

One teacher that I work with believes that the easter revision courses give students the impression that all they need are a lot of quality notes and sample essays, discouraging them from actually doing any work themselves.

What's your take on the matter? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Many of my colleagues have spent time in the UAE and they have all really enjoyed the experience. Particularly my female colleagues, maybe it's wrong of me but I assumed it would be a difficult experience. Either way they had serious craic over there. Anecdotally I've heard that that the students are all rather difficult to teach but that's only a small part of your experience. Do get advice from others who have been.

An okay site to look at to get started would be:

However you should look around and get more advice from other expats and teachers who have been. Your salary and benefits may vary depending on the company. But when I looked into it last year most offers paid for my food and accommodation not including pay. </TEXT>

In 99% of cases I've found a workaround, some harder and some super simple. Just one game that NEVER worked. I don't think steam should be held hostage to users that can't look up a message board but for the seriously dysfunctional cases a warning would be appreciated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that's fair enough.

Most importantly, Steam 'is just the vendor'. The overall functionality of the game should be sorted with the provider. Yeah it'd be nice if steam included all patches but that's not their job.

A simple warning "There have been known compatibility issues with this game" would suffice.

But also, only if its on the scale of thousands. If all it requires is a .dll file then Steam shouldn't be held hostage to completely helpless users. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, to their credit they have always been really good with returns in my experience. But even a warning like that would be good, might reduce some of the negative feedback at least.

In terms of common sense, I would say there is a spectrum of skill required to install some games. For some its simply running in comparability mode, for others it requires you to install several programs and basic coding. Its a slippery slope in terms of what they are allowed to get away with,. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Authenticity vs Originality: Should game titles be bound to cannon? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-06 15:21:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've seen debates on the authenticity of a game's story played out many times. How bound to the original concept must a game be in ordered to consider it great? There are two issues that I see here:

First of all, the game series. Titles such as Fallout and The Elder Scrolls have volumes of Lore, the Fallout Bible considered by many as the ultimate guide for what is and what is not Fallout material. Whether Bethesda, Obsidian or a new Developer take over the next Fallout project, should they be bound to the cannon to the letter? Yes there are certain elements that make up the game as a whole, the history, the super mutants, the vaults, but what if a new concept is created by the developers that would make a truly awesome game but would also go against the lore?

"Then its just not a cannon game, there are plenty of non cannon fallout games..."

Yes but one of the reasons that these games are not considered equal to the main series is that they were not cannon. Flawed games but that term "non-cannon" is like a scarlet letter. Why bother playing it? Much like real life, facts are only truth until a new truth is discovered. What if the next title completely rewrites the source of FEV or one of the original protagonists?

Secondly, the titles, standalone or series, that come from other media. Batman, Lord of the rings etc. There was a recent discussion on the validity of "Shadow of Mordor" because of the non cannon elements. To be clear, I have not played this game myself.

In the same way that Christopher Nolan took his own approach to the Batman Universe, should developers not be entitled to the same? While many non cannon games are great, there is undoubtedly a black mark over them, they're not allowed sit at the same table as the Cannon games. Is this fair or is the distinction between cannon and non-cannon an important one?

<TEXT> Oh well that's fair enough, a lot of that reads like the bible it's quite hard to get through, impressive work by Tolkien but really complex.

The hobbit is my favorite book but I think the movie was right to make the changes it did. Most of the boom is walking and talking and would have made a shite movie. Without having played that game (I definitely will now) I would be supportive of people taking artistic licence to produce a great piece of work as opposed to sticking to lore for the sake of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well I'm a big fan but I'm going to get upset by a non cannon game. I think we have to separate media we consume and accept that not everything needs to.be in cannon.

If the "Return of the king" game has Mr blobby as the main antagonist I'm gonna be like.. hey what's up?
But if somebody wants to have a shot at a general LOTR universe styled game then cool. If it's a good game it's a good game. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Should services like Steam have a responsibility to ensure that their games are playable on the system you are using? </TITLE>

<TEXT> Steam has, in my opinion, quite a reasonable returns policy, one I've used more frequently than I would like. But shouldn't they have a responsibility to words customers in ensuring that the game they are selling me actually works on my PC?

I'm not talking about basic System requirements like RAM and available space, that lands squarely in my responsibility as a consumer. But what about games that don't work on certain systems? Leaving us to crawl through pages of FAQs to find a patch or dll etc...

Perhaps they could offer games pre adapted for your system? Or do as android app store does and only make titles available for the appropriate systems based on your hardware?

Having spent hours trying to get KOTOR 2 to run on Windows 10 I gave up. Sure I got my.money back but that's no the point. I wish they would simp take responsibility for the titles they are selling. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've managed to get through every game on my "to-do" list and looking for the next. The problem is I can't think of any PC available titles, yeah I can look up random titles but how would I know what's any good?

I loved the Dark Souls, Fallout, Elder Scrolls, Splinter Cell and Arkham Series. I've also replayed a lot of older titles, wasteland, portal, Deus Ex etc.. Basically looking for a good RPG to some degree.

I did my best with Bioshock 1 2 but just found them.to.be tedious shooters. Beautifully styled but repetitive.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Edit: Witcher 1? Is this worth my while? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-04-04 10:35:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I understand that normally with sequels there is a bump in graphical requirements. However my PC runs 8gig if RAM and has no problem with any other modern game I've tried at high detail.

Both games are at 2/4 gig of RAM yet DS prepare to die runs incredibly poorly which is worrying considering the graphics are not wonderful.

I have heard that DS1 was never made specifically for the PC but DS2 was. Should I theoretically be able to run DS2 smoother than DS1 or does the series just not run well on certain PCs?  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm finding a few issues with the game, having recently aqcuired it. The biggest issue is simply the fact that console commands come up "Press A to loot" etc.

Is there a version which has actually been adapted to pc properly?

The other issue is a strange one. My PC is high spec and bought recently, however I find the graphics don't run as smoothly on DS1.

Was this game never properly ported for pc or have I fucked up somewhere down the line on my end? </TEXT>

<TEXT> There was very little in the way of creatures that were not carried over to Fallout 3, NV and 4. For such a unique and powerful creature not to.be carried over to me seems odd. I wouldn't think that it was a case of there not being a relevant place for them to exist. They had escaped to the wastes like the Deathclaw. 

If they were going specifically for the research facility feel then there could have been a few at the enclave base or vault 87 in 3. Most of the DLCs in NV would have supported them too (I feel).  </TEXT>

For every calculation a flat Earther says proves their theory there's another that defeats it. The only way around (pun intended) surely has to be actually honest to God proof? You can't keep rellying on "the government won't let us". </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be honest what drew me in to each game was the environment. I knew there was a base story but I made my own character and, to a degree, had my own relationship with companions and everything else. Without trying to sound like a child, im not - im a teacher - I kind of made my own fun. Yes I do love lore. It's great to find out the back story of a character and how it fits with other NPCs. But you know what else I loved? How quickly the tide of combat could change and how smart you had to be no matter how overpowered you were. I can get past a bit of crappy dialogue if it's still a good representation of the Fallout universe. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My first encounter with the series was when I bought  Fallout 3 while I was sick. I had never played a game so immersive and well written. I later bought myself 1 2 and was not disappointed. Again, New Vegas came out and it was just another reason to respect the series. 

I haven't had the time to buy 4 yet and I don't know if I will now. It seems that every second comment online about the game is not just a critique, it's being ripped apart.

I'm aware of the issues with dialogue in the game and complaints of a lack of RPG elements. So should I bother? Am I wasting my time?

As a fan of several RPG series (especially Bethesda) I have learned to take the good with the bad, what a sequel will do wrong in its continuation of the series, it will also make up for in its improvements in other areas lacking thus far. 

So tell me. Is all of this just hype? Will I lose anything in the Canon by not playing this? Or is it a very flawed game that still needs to be played? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This. To be honest Morrow is still the most fullfilling game I have ever played in my life. OK the graphics are horrible bit there are several texture packs you can download that at this stage are really easy to install. (Absolute nightmare when it first came out. I credit that process as being the sole reason I'm good with computers now.)

You can't fast travel in Morrowind bar a handfull of silt striders that take you too main cities. This makes it a lot more real. You need to traverse a very difficult landscape on foot for 90% of the game.

The most diverse set of skills and weapons and the only elder scrolls game where you can rely solely on magic and not have a horrible time.

Again get past the graphics. I'm sure you still play 8bit games from time to time. 

Also... dammit I'm going to reinstall it now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We live on the second floor of a two story set of apartments where we have a 5x15m balcony area where we keep Sky's kennel. She only spends time out there when we're not home and the railing is far too high for her to jump.

The problem:

We absent mindedly moved her kennel against the railing underneath a bird feeder. Why not? She's not going to jump off our balcony into the garden below right?

The result was our 15 month old Whippet jumping up to get the birds and falling 26ft over the balcony railing to the garden below us. Luckily she hit a tree (lucky's not a great word to use) which broke her fall and every branch on the way down.

Ironically the reason we've been in and out of the vets the last few days wasn't because of broken bones. It's because she was then loose in our estate for about an hour until we came home where she ate a box of KFC chicken bones which have become stuck in her colon.

Three days and two enemas later she's a little sore and sedated but largely on the mend. When we realised that she'd fallen off the balcony, chicken bones were the last thing on our minds. Lesson learned.

Also were now considering pet insurance since our Whippet has about as much concern for her physical safety as John McClane. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But the schools are partially responsible. So is the education system. Schools widely acknowledge this and so does the education system. You clearly don't know what you are talking about if you are saying it's not the schools fault and that I am biased when I am merely repeating what all concerned parties already agree on. You can keep replying with your angry uninformed racist comments. There are people debating where the responsibilities lie with the travelling community but they don't use racist terms because they're intelligent to know that proper communication is the only way you get your point across. You on the other hand are on the fringes because you just want everyone to know how angry you are.

I'll say it again. Schools, teachers and the education system all recognise they have a responsibility in rectifying problems they have caused. You don't get to say that's wrong simply because you don't like it. The schools and government themselves would actually disagree with you. If you don't like travellers fine. You lose credibility when you say things that simply aren't true. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've recently gotten married and have started to look ahead to family and kids and the one thing I don't have are pictures of me from birth to about 16. I'm not really about to just forget about them and move on becausw they're very important to me.

The issue is that I have been NC with my entire family for several years, I do not speak to anyone. A while back my NSister contacted me pleading to end the NC to which I simply did not respond.

I'm just wondering if any of you have experience with getting things back once going NC. I'm not afraid to ask but I worry that I'm (a) being hypocritical and (b) undermining the while idea of going NC by asking for the pictures. Any advice would be really appreciated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The fact that you are using the phrase "knackers" shoes that you choose to use a derogatory phrase showing your bias and therefore lack any objective input.

Every educational training program from primary to secondary education (HDIP etc) supports this. I haven't plucked this out of the air.

It isn't the schools fault for their losses and problems. It's probably 50/50. But you've made top many assumptions for anything I say to matter. There are statistics and data that back up what I'm saying not some leftist rightist whatever stupid label you want to use movement.

At the end of the day. If you think you are justified in making a sweeping statement about a group of people that you don't know in its entirety then fine. I've spent my career on this. With regards to the educarion system im right here. Im not being emotive. Im just talking about statistics that every teacher and education officer understands. Typically people who use offensive language are not as informed on a single topic as others. You've shown your bias already by saying you hate them. You're as bad as the groups that wanted to exterminate the Jews or african or the Chinese. 

I don't want to have a row with you because clearly you've had bad experiences with travellers growing up so I can't deny what you've seen. But you're not approaching this argument objectively so you can't really make a valid statement on it.

I will discuss what I know happily but there's no point in calling a 6 year old or a 10 year old or a 45 year old youn dont know a term they find offensive because you're angry. You're Pont of view will never be heard if you only throw stones. Please chill a bit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you're the sort of person that doesn't mind playing slightly dated graphics I would consider getting the trilogy. To be fair there are only certain parts of the first game (exploring worlds) where you might question the graphics but it's not something you really notice either.

Personally I found the series to be fantastic. A brilliant story arc with fairly decent RPG elements. I found the good/evil aspect to be fairly meaningless outside of individual questions choices and personal preference. But I'm nitpicking and others may disagree. 

Play from start to finish. The best aspect of the game is how your save from each prior game can be uploaded to the next. So how you finished ME1 can unlock unique aspects to the next game. So something small you did in ME1 can decide whether a particular companion is alive or not in ME3. 

So yeah. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's not so bad. I'm OK with change and I understand that this needs to happen in order for the series to progress.

From both sides it seems that the biggest issue was the dialogue. That's disappointing tbh. But after a while in NV I would skip a lot of that when I knew what was being said.

I found changes like that a but Jarring in other series too, Dragon age for one threw me but I love them now.

I'll have to play it for myself to see but I'm the sort of fan that thinks Canon is Canon so we need to suck it up and find a way to love the game because I love the series. Thanks for the advice! </TEXT>

<TEXT> How on earth could they do away with the skill tree? What's the point in specialising now? It's just another shooter game then. I feel like this is a step towards making the series more populist like they did with Skyrym. In NV your build didn't just affect how well you did in every mission from start to finish but also decided which path you would take either. I'm really surprised by this because with the reintroduction of a proper faction system I hoped they were moving back towards the depth we got from 1   2. Ruined my day this has. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We will be getting a 12 week old male soon in addition to our year and a half old female. At the start he will obviously sleep in a seperate crate for housebreaking, training and general comfort. However, I'm just curious whether or not we should/could crate both together eventually? In my head I think it would be good for them because our Sky sleeps with us on weekends and loves it. On the other hand I don't want to put then in a situation that would cause them harm or discomfort. Any advice? </TEXT>

Doesn't the distinction create more beurocracy and hassle between the two departments? In Ireland we just have the Garda Siochana who police rural and city areas.

<TEXT> The Donor Kebab was invented by a Turkish man living In Berlin using Turkish Ingredients. The wrap was added to the meat and vegetables simply because the food had become very popular with drunks late at night (shocking) and to avoid drunken customers breaking any more dishes, the owner found it easier to enclose the food in a wrap and send them on their way.

Although it is largely associated with Turkish food and sold by Turkish owners, the Donor Kebab is generally accepted as originating from Berlin.

Personally I think that you can get ingredients from all over the world to make any number of dishes but it takes its significance from the culture in which it developed, which in this case was the US. </TEXT>

We have to, despite years of experience telling us a student will grow up a certain way, there's a chance they won't and we may be responsible for sending them on the wrong path all because of our bias.

<TEXT> As a teacher, the honest answer is that whether you get good grades or perform poorly, you can find yourself pretty much anywhere in life. 

Poor grades can sometimes simply be a result of a system that benefits certain types of people and not because you're stupid. I've known people who've failed academically and are now very happy and successful having applied themselves later on in life.

Similarly, you can get good grades and still end up getting fired, or homeless, the economy may turn, people may leave you. The only thing you can ever truly do is apply yourself to everything you do, the pride in your work and develop dreams that will make you happy in life and when life screws you over (which it will from time to time) stand up, brush yourself off and start again. As long as you've tried your best you can always hold your head up high in life. 

Try to achieve good grades, but if you don't, dont worry, try something else. </TEXT>

I've experienced a lot of different schools and in  every staff room the inappropriate comments and jokes about travellers are plenty full. Yes some teachers are fine but it's a very difficult thing to witness. This affects how they are treated in class and the children are aware of this. They know they are hated, I can't imagine wanting to send my kids to an Irish school if if was a traveller parent. Educational difficulties are also widely ignored with traveler students and they don't receive the help that government bodies and studies have shown they need. Traveller culture, history and language is also not welcomed or expressed in schools. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not yes.
Not no.

It depends on age, a young whippet doesn't have as much padding as an adult. However whippets feet are quite soft normally.

If it was on a rough ground over a long time then that might have done it. But...

Ask your vet. If a dog bleeds from its feet it's a problem full stop. It's not normal. But don't beat yourself up over it. Whippets are one of the most peculiar breeds around. These things happen. Ask your vet, they're the expert. Good luck, everything will be fine! </TEXT>

As in do they all work on the same principal or should I be on the look out for one that uses a specific process? Never used one so to me it sounds like a vastly complicated device! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Raw food treats? </TITLE>

<TEXT> I'm not a big fan of giving our whippet, Sky, treats during the day but I find it great for training. I haven't come across any raw food treats that aren't pretty packaged, Ide rather make them myself but don't know where to start. I could freeze small portions of her regular food but that wouldn't really last because when they melt they'd just go everywhere again. Any help would be really appreciated! </TEXT>

<TEXT> My whippet sky had issues with her digestion since we got her as a pup a year ago. We literally tried everything, antibiotics, specialised pet food, treatment for colitis. Nothing worked and she was loosing weight and bleeding from her anus quite badly. Then we switched to raw on a last ditch attempt and intant success. Would never go back to anything else. Hope everything works out for ya! </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was like the worst withdrawl from caffeine. I just remember headaches and like above, upset sleep patterns. As long as you're following your doctors advice re: how to quit, for me it was halving then quartering the dose but yours could be different, you'll be fine.

The clearest feeling was that of a cloud being lifted and feeling more like me again. Drink water and try some herbal remedies for the sleep in the meantime. You'll be fine  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Advice Request] How do you deal with estrangement long term? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-02 01:59:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm new to this forum and was looking for advice with regards to dealing with estrangement long term.  I'm at a point now where I'm moving on with life, I'm happily married as of this year and estranged about two years properly.

What I find hard is the idea of being very much alone. In a sense I feel as though I lack identity or roots. U often envy my wife's relationship with her family and I find myself caught in a contradiction. I wish I had some one that I could call family, someone who (and I know this is selfish) is just for me. At the same time I don't want that from my parents.

How do you cope with this in adulthood?

Note: I have attended counselling and dealt with a lot of issues but got to a point with them where they simply said "well this is kind of how it is for you now" </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be honest in not a uniquely Irish thing, although I do it myself. It's a habit formed by cultures that had a large amount of poverty. A lot of Asian countries share the same practice if bringing fruits and vegetables from home with them. Originally it was something we brought over out of neccesity but in modern times its more of a cultural habit. You don't see it with other western countries because they didn't have the same level of widespread poverty as we did. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Should we get a second Whippet? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-21 21:50:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My wife and I live in Ireland and currently own a year old female. We have done the research and are happy to get a second for us and we believe for company for our current Whippet. We live in an apartment which has as much space as your typical house and we live across from a field where we run her every day.

My question is this. Do we need more space for a second Whippet? She spends most of the day sleeping to be fair and gets plenty of exercise.

We are also wondering whether we should wait for her to get older. Our Whippet is nearly a year and the pup would be three months, should our Whippet be older? 

So ar we have followed all the advice and would really like a second but we also don't want to act irresponsibly. Any advice? </TEXT>

<TEXT> My wife and I had the same problem with our ten month old. She would chew wires and pee around the house. The advice we received was that Whippets are more comfortable and less stressed in a smaller space. We keep her confined to the kitchen (door open to the back and toys out) and don't let her in the rest of the house. The kitchen  is quite small too. So far we've seen a big improvement from when she had access to other rooms. 

Other small tips that we found helpful:

- Don't make a big deal about leaving, especially if you have a routine before you go (keys, coat etc. ) if a Whippet with separation anxiety notices these are signs your leaving it can cause stress.

- Make sure you're cleaning pee with non-amonia or bleach products. It may act as a marker. Detol spray works for us.

- Have talk radio on in the background.

- Leave something in the room that smells like you.

Best of luck! </TEXT>

Just because you're not xenophobic or racist doesn't mean you're not doing something wrong. I lived a lot of my life with the belief that because I feel everyone is equal I couldn't put a foot wrong.

We need to educate ourselves about the realities of other cultures or groups and assuming that you know all you need to know about cultural sensitivity is a mistake. Someone who is very clued in on LGBTIQ issues may know very little on Aboriginal issues etc. It's not beong politically correct. It's about educating yourself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think we have to consider two things here (no kids but hope to in the future).

1. What we consider "adult content" shifts from.generation to generation and even then is largely subjective based on culture or family. Sex was a big threshold in my family and wasn't talked about at all before a certain age when I had the talk, Sex scenes would be skipped over all the time. My friends' family considered homosexuality to be an "adult" concept and as a result never heard of it until about 5th class.

2. We should accept that parents cannot properly censor most of the content their children take in on a daily basis. When I was a kid I heard about adult stuff from my friends in hushed tones. Nowadays your average music video or reality TV show is far more explicit.

As a teacher I think honesty is the best policy, don't shield your children from these things because you can't. Get out in front of it. Let them know what is realistic, what is appropriate and they will come to you in time with questions. Avoid the issue or make it taboo and you're creating a problem. </TEXT>
