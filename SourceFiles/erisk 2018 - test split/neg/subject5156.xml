First order $6.00 + Revan $25.00 = $31

Bat signal $10.00 + Mr. Freeze $8.00 + Tartan $5.00 = $23

I would do Revan for Batsignal, Mr freeze and tartan. </TEXT>

Once in wars though, we play to win. We have a good record, currently 122 and 30. Donations are fast and high level. Clan tag is #2RUP8JJ0. Mention reddit when you apply and we will let you in.

<TITLE> [H] Black Pearl 4184 [W] Star Wars, Modulars </TITLE>

<TEXT> [Link to image](http://i.imgur.com/aXthXF4.jpg)

The ship itself is 100% complete, but only has the Jack Sparrow and Will Turner minifigures. No box or instructions.

Looking for any modulars except Pet Shop, or larger star wars sets such as: UCS TIE, UCS Slave I, Sandcrawler, Ewok Village, Red 5 X-Wing, any of the bigger Rogue One sets, Republic Frigate, Republic Cruiser, Malevolence, or Imperial Star Destroyer. 

I value the pearl at $200, so anything that adds up to that I will consider.

CONUS only please.

The light up figures are probably the most valuable: Luminara-$20, Vader-$24 and Mace Windu-$23 according to bricklink. Ki-Adi Mundi is worth about $12 and the blue 501 clone tropper about $7.50. Captain rex can be $15+. Most of the other plain clones and stormtroopers are worth about $2-$5 probably. Some of the rarer R2 units are valuable too, R8-B7 is worth about $12. Battle droids are worth about $1 each, a bit more for the super battle droids. </TEXT>

The ship is 100% complete. But only comes with two minifigures, Jack Sparrow and Will Turner.

Looking for $200 via paypal which does not include shipping. Would prefer only to ship to CONUS.

Would consider trades of equal value as well,  either modulars or Star Wars.

<TEXT> They added the extra 30 seconds in the same update that added the poison spell. Since troops didn't run away from the poison spell, you could clear a clan castle in just a few seconds. I think they took away the extra 30 seconds to balance out the fact that it really didn't take any time to lure and kill clan castles. Now that troops run out of poison spells and you have to actually spend time luring and killing clan castle troops, I think they should add the 30 seconds back. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a unique figure, only released in that one set. There are a lot of people who only collect star wars minifigures, so if they want to complete their sets, they need a Darth Malgus. It's basically a function of supply an demand. Any minifigures that were only released in one set can go for a premium. Another example is Queen Amidala from set 9499. It can fetch close to $50. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Schmi's statement isn't ambiguous at all. Why did Anakin never try to find his father? Why is there never any mention of his father at all? Deadbeat or not, as the most powerful force user in the galaxy, he probably would have wanted to find his father at some point, even if it was just to kill him for abandoning him. From the canon section wookiepedia article on Anakin Skywalker "Believed to have been conceived by the Force, he was born to Shmi Skywalker and moved to the Outer Rim world of Tatooine at a young age, where he and his mother were slaves." </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is way more evidence of a virgin birth than just a deadbeat father. His midiclorians levels are off the charts. Schmi says there was no father. He's the Chosen One, declared by a prophecy. There's the obvious Jesus Christ comparison. And then add the conversation with Palpatine talking about how Plageus created life...while sitting in front of a giant egg with sperm flying into it. I don't think it could be any more clear. Also, in the 2012 Darth Plageus novel (no longer cannon, but whatever) "Using his newfound power to heal his own body, Plagueis decided to take his powers further and reached out to the midi-chlorians across the galaxy in order to gain dominance over them, but the Force resisted his efforts and refused. In response, the midi-chlorians acted of their own accord and conceived a child within the Human slave Shmi Skywalker." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not sure exactly what you mean by the reliability of Bricklink, but I've made multiple purchases, mostly smaller lots of individual bricks or minifigs and have never had an issue. You can see how many sales a store has had and view feedback just like ebay. Obviously buying from a new store with little feedback is riskier than buying from an established store. To answer your other questions:

1. Ebay is probably the most reliable. It has protections for buyers and sellers. Prices tend to be higher on ebay due to fees. Bricklink is probably the second most reliable since it is an established marketplace. I've never sold on bricklink, only bought. Prices tend to be lower than ebay. There's also r/Legomarket which I have made multiple purchases on. There's a feedback system so you can see how many successful trades/sales people have had. Prices tend to be equal or a little lower than bricklink, since most users know about bricklink and use it to find values of sets.

1. The best way to ship completed lego sets is to take them apart and put the pieces in ziplock bags. Depending on the size of the set, you can either send it in a padded envelope, (usually about $2.50 in the CONUS) or in one of those USPS flatrate boxes. I think the smallest size is $6.80 to ship. You can use newspaper, packing peanuts, or really anything else as padding.

1. Depends on how much you value your time. It can take a long time to make sure sets are 100% complete, but those are the sets that will get you the most money. The 6 month average sale price for the UCS yoda is $287 on bricklink, and the AT-TE is $100.

<TEXT> That really sucks man. I've gotten some great deals. 75% off the falcon and tydirium. When I pick up in store, I just tell them the "in store" price was cheaper and ask if I can buy for the "in store" price. Usually they're pretty sceptical, since the online prices are usually cheaper than in store prices. They return the item and either refund the card I used to pay for it originally, or they give me a Walmart gift card for the return price. Then they just ring it up as a normal sale and the clearance price comes up. I've had a few of the employees actually congratulate me for finding such good deals. When they need to get approval from a manager, they really haven't cared at all. As long as the price that's ringing up is accurate, there's nothing they can really do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've bought things online from walmart at full price and had them shipped to walmarts that have the item on clearance. I've done it probably 8 different times at a handful of different walmarts, and even had an employee recommend I do it when their app said an item was in stock but wasn't on the shelf. I guess it's a gamble and YMMV since sometimes managers are unwilling to do it, but I've never had any problems. </TEXT>

Anakin's custom 75087 is the newest one and probably the most unique build. I would say either Plo Koon 8093 and Saesee Tiin 9498 are the best bang for your buck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I usually use TCGplayer.com for prices, so whatever they're going for on there, I'll try to beat, but it might not be easy since these cards are mostly under $1.00. For example, bulbasaur goes for about .23. Let me know your full wants and if you want to look up prices on tcg, you can list those as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand you not wanting to sell all of your 4500 cards individually, but I thought since you had whittled that number down significantly, you might be willing to split up some sets. I also thought 24/34 cards would have been a big enough chunk for you to be happy. I understand though. Thanks for the response. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When it comes down to it, it's poor writing and continuity by George Lucas. You can do all the mental somersaults you want, but there really is no logical way to rectify Han Solo's lines about a hokey religion with the reality of the Jedi during the clone wars. You just said there are 1 trillion people on Courascant. So I'm willing to wager that the majority of them knew about the Jedi temple. I bet every kid on Courascant grew up taking filed trips there at least once in their life. There's 1 trillion people with practically direct encounters with Jedi. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't really buy this. I've never seen a member of US special forces in real life, but I've heard of them. They're on the news. A galactic conflict would have gotten a lot of news coverage in a technologically advanced society. There must have been 24 hour news coverage with footage from every battle. I mean, just think about episode III when a massive star ship crashes into Courascant. What about the thousands and thousands of clone troopers who eventually retired from the army and rejoined society? They saw first hand the power of the Jedi. You could say the Empire tried to destroy the memory of the Jedi, but you still have Vader talking about the force and choking people. Why would he do that if their goal was to keep the force secret? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I went to my local wal-mart this weekend looking for Anakin's Custom Jedi Starfighter, 75087. It was listed as in stock, and for only $9.00 on the wal-mart app. I couldn't find it in the store, so I asked someone who worked there. He looked on the shelf and it wasn't there, but he told me I could order it online and have it shipped to the store for free. I asked him if I would get the clearance price of $9.00 and he said yes, it would be the in store price. I've seen a lot of other posts on here about people doing something similar, but I've got proof from an employee that it should work. I looked on brickseek and found a nearby store with a Millennium Falcon for $35 and I used the app to have it shipped to the store for pickup. I'm having a friend pick it up for me, so I'll report back and let everyone know if they gave him any hassle. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got all three of these sets for $25! I honestly couldn't believe it.

7679 was about 99% complete with minifigs and instructions. Basically all that was missing were a few antenna.


8039 had instructions but just the two clone minifigs. It was missing close to 50 pieces, mostly some interior stuff like Palpatine's desk, and the escape pod. It had the bomb dropping mechanism and the clone turret thing.

10178 did not have minifigures or instructions. It was missing close to 100 pieces, mostly details on the "head part". The motor still works, and it walks great!


I've spent about $50 on bricklink orders, and they're much closer to complete at this point, just missing a few small pieces here and there. I've also spent about $18 on some of the missing figs. So all told, I'm into these three sets for about $95...not too bad at all! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Clone Turbo Tank, Republic Gunship and Jango's Salve I are definitely worth some money. That Mace Windu figure alone can go for $15-$20. And if you have Jango Fett, that figure can go for $40. You can check prices on bricklink.com or look at sold listings on ebay to get an idea. There's also /r/legomarket. I'd be interested in the Arc 170 if you wanted to sell.

edit: just noticed you have the green scout trooper from the turbo tank too. That guy is also worth $15-$20 on his own. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I honestly feel like this game isn't designed to win defenses at all, on either side. It seems like both sides can easily 100% a base, especially if you use 6 airstrikes. I'm a new lvl 8 Imperial, and unless I have 4 snipers in my Squad Center, I will lose every single defense. Even with snipers, I can easily loose 100k in resources or 1,000CB if my shields get taken out and the rebel uses air strikes. I think the air strikes are way overpowered. You shouldn't be able to destroy a resource storage holding 50k or 100k loot with a 6,000 credit air strike. I play a lot of Clash of Clans as well, and I kind of compare the air strikes to the lightning spell. I can't imagine how the game mechanics would be broken if you could use 1 lightning spell to destroy an entire storage.

For attacks, I usually use the Hero AT-AT, 3 tanks, 2 spider tank guys, 5 dark troopers and 18 or so storm troopers. I can consistently get 2 stars and most of the loot, and especially if I use air strikes. That being said, I've been absolutely wrecked by rebels using nothing but med droids and heavies.

There are a few things you can do to make your base less appealing to attacks, beyond what others have already said. You can expose your HQ and hope that people just snipe it and move on. You can also try to never have too much of both credits and alloy. If you're heavy on both resources, you're a huge target, but if you keep one low, you will be a less desirable target. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Go to TH9. Lvl 6 troops and the AQ will make raiding a lot easier. Xbows and extra Wizard Tower, Archer Tower, and Air Defense will make your base stronger defensively. You'll have plenty of upgrades as a new TH9 to keep your loot low, so don't worry about getting destroyed on defense. I'm a th9 and still have 8 pink walls. With an exposed TH and keeping my resources low, I haven't noticed much difference in the rate of my base being 100%

It's stupid to spend all of your time just maxing your walls, the game will get boring. And besides, even if you have all skull walls as a new th9, anyone with lvl 6 balloons is going to 100% you anyway. </TEXT>

When I'm attacking, I try to avoid corner bases. It tells me that the person knows what they're doing. A centralized base is vulnerable from attack from everywhere, but putting your base in a corner allows you to group turret fire on people who try to attack from the corner. 

I'm not sure about the medal thing, but if you get 1* and lose some medals, you should be able to gain them back pretty quickly. You're not going to lose all that many medals exposing your HQ, if that's what you decide to do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you break shield a lot? If you break shield a lot, you're going to get attacked more than necessary. Are all of your resource collectors lvl 7? Try to keep one resource at a minimum, either credits or alloy to make your base less attractive for attackers. Don't have more than one turret upgrading at a time. And lastly, if you don't care about medals, you can always expose your HQ and hope you get a snipe instead of a full on attack. I'm HQ7 Empire, but those are just some general tips that can help.

edit: What's your base layout? Is it in a corner? </TEXT>

<TEXT> My clan does 10v10 wars. For first attacks, everyone takes their mirror. For 2nd attacks, we usually have the lowest person try to 3* the lowest base with open stars. It works pretty well. We can usually 3* the bottom 5 and get 2 or more stars on the top 5. I think our average is about 25 stars each war, and we've won the majority of our wars. We war about every 10 days or so. We have two TH7, two TH8 and the rest TH9, some newer than others. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [From wiki:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feodosia#Theodosia) It is believed that the devastating pandemic the Black Death entered Europe for the first time via Caffa in 1347, through the movements of the Golden Horde. After a protracted siege... they catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls, infecting the inhabitants, in one of the first cases of biological warfare. Fleeing inhabitants may have carried the disease back to Italy, causing its spread across Europe. However, the plague appears to have spread in a stepwise fashion, taking over a year to reach Europe from Crimea. Also, there were a number of Crimean ports under Mongol control, so it is unlikely that Caffa was the only source of plague-infested ships heading to Europe. In addition, there were overland caravan routes from the East that would have been carrying the disease into Europe as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't waste gems on boosting your elixir pumps or gold mines. It's much more efficient to boost your barracks and raid for 2 hours with BARCH. The first thing I would do is get the Archer Queen, that will help you with raiding, because you need to do a lot of raiding to salvage this base. Focus on splash damage defenses first, Mortars and Wizard Towers. Also, I'm only seeing 3 air defenses, you need to buy your 4th AD and upgrade those to at least all lvl 5. After that, you can focus on canons and archer towers. You should have at least like 75% purple walls too, and buy two more teslas. You should most definitely get a 4th builder too, having only 3 builders is just going to make it much, much longer to get this base to even a solid town hall 8 level. </TEXT>

And walls are more of a psychological deterrent than anything else. A th8 with all skull walls is going to get demolished by a th9 with loonian anyway.

edit: Also, if you plan on playing pretty regularly, I would get another builder. You should try and keep 3 busy at all times, and then have one free for upgrading walls. Also, get the Archer Queen, that will make raiding easier for you. Join a clan too, that way you can get war loot to help with upgrades. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, 3 level 6 ADs are going to tear apart dragons. You might be able to get 1 or 2 stars with mass drag, but not 3. Mass hog won't be able to do it either, especially since your hogs are lvl 1. Seems like you're out of luck. 

Balloonain maybe? But again, those AD are going to do a lot of damage. Maybe Giants and Wizards? Drop a group of like 20 giants, drop a few wall breakers to get them through the first layer, then drop a line of 16 or so wizards behind the giants to clean up. You can use barbs and archers to lure out the clan castle first.

EDIT: Use 2 heal spells for when your giants need it, and a rage spell to give your troops an extra spurt to destroy a tough defensive building or town hall. Have 5 more wizards in clan castle. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It really is almost an exact clone. At this point it's a little buggy.  I like some of the stuff they do differently. The single player is a lot more in depth. And your base is locked from editing until you hold your finder on the screen for like 5 seconds, so no accidentally moving stuff around, which is nice. You also have to either pick rebels or imperials. I like it, I basically play in between training CoC armies </TEXT>

<TEXT> He confessed and was convicted, but some question the validity. From the Wiki: 

Although Gilles de Rais was convicted of murdering many children through his confessions and the detailed eyewitness accounts of his own confederates and victims' parents, doubts have persisted about the court's verdict. Counterarguments are based on the theory de Rais was himself a victim of an ecclesiastic plot or act of revenge by the Catholic Church or French state.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, not necessarily. The difficulty for SHA256 mining is much higher than scrypt. Partly because almost everyone mining sha256 is using an ASIC. You can use the website coinwarz.com to see exactly how many coins you would get using a sh256 ASIC or a GPU mining scrypt. It all depends on current difficulty levels, and exactly what your hashrate is compared to the entire network.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, a premine is basically exactly what you described. At best, it is used to fund projects related to the coin, but at worst it's a way for the developers and early adopters to make profits.

Myriad has 5 separate algorithms, that can only produce 1/5 of the coins mined. So if you are using a sha256 ASIC, that has no impact on the scrypt miner using his GPU. ASIC miners compete with other ASIC miners, GPU miners compete with other GPU miners, and so on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When matchmaking for clan wars, is it based on your clan's average strength, or individual members' strength? For example, and I'm just using an arbitrary scale here, if you have 5 members who are rated a 10 and 5 members who are rated a 5, that would make your clan average a 7.5. Would you get matched with a clan whose average is 7.5 no matter the composition, or would you be matched with 5 10s and 5 5s? Thanks for any help, my clan hasn't gone to war yet, and we're trying to decide if we're ready. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In most cases, no, they aren't profitable. But you also said ignoring electricity costs. So if you're mining for free, everything is profit. I don't have much experience mining other algorithms. There's skein, which a lot of gpu miners seem to like, lower temperatures and power consumption. x11 is another one. If you're trying to get rich mining, you need an ASIC, pure and simple. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 80% of $200 is $160. That gives him $40 to spread among 10 different cryptos, as you recommended. 

While it's definitely a good idea to invest a majority of your money in bitcoin, I might say do 50% btc and spread the other $100 among ltc, doge, Myriad, vert, dark and monero. There are pretty big price differences among those 6 coins, ranging from ~$10 per coin to less than 1 cent per coin. Any of them have potential to increase in price, obviously some more than others. </TEXT>

How many miners are supported on 1 controller?
This is sometimes miner specific so mileage may vary. Larger miners tend to have more chips so the quantity of larger miners supported will be less than the total quantity of smaller miners supported.

I've never personally purchased from this site, but I have seen others on Reddit recommend it. You can use the coupon code "gaw25" to get $25 off a purchase of $200 or the code "retailme15" to get $15 off. Not sure what the minimum price is for the $15 off coupon.

The 1.3 ms/s Fury Scrypt miner for $109 is a pretty good deal, although the prices seem to drop every week or so. They also recommend buying a Zenminer controller, which is $70.

<TEXT> The prospect of anyone mining four different algorithms on the same machine is so infinitesimal, it's laughable. And the thought that enough people would do this to successfully 51% attack myriadcoin is extremely remote. 

We're talking about a lot of hyptheticals with Myriadcoin, a lot of "what ifs" when there is currently a pool with the ability to 51% attack bitcoin, and just a few weeks ago the same thing happened to litecoin. Which coins are more resistant to 51% attacks, the ones who have already had pools with 51% of the hashrate, or the coin that people have to come up with very, very extreme cases that may result in a 51% attack? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, this is a forum for discussing crypto currencies, everything everyone says about their coin of choice could be misconstrued as "culty"

It's not like Myriad is a scam coin that we're trying to get people to invest in for a pump and dump. Just people legitimately excited about a coin that solves a lot of problems other coins seem to ignore. And the fact that Myriad is largely ignored by the wider crypto culture is annoying, especially when something like NeutrinoCoin can soar to #10 in marketcap and all of a sudden everyone's talking about yet another scam coin instead of coins with actual longevity. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I was mining over at muchdig.com since about January 28th. I was cpu mining, so wasn't making a ton of doge, but I got about 500 in 4 days. For the last 10 days or so though, we've been stuck on a block, and it looks like my payout will probably be minuscule. Just looking for some sympathy doge from anyone who feels my pain. All tips would be appreciated. Thank you all in advance. </TEXT>
