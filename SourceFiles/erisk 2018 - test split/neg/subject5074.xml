<TEXT> Hi, the daughter is (I think) about 8 years old, and so I don't think she's very reliable. It's also very hard to waltz into someone's house and just ask to speak to their child; that's just plain weird. Apologies if I've pissed you off, and yes I do read the comments! </TEXT>

<TEXT> PART 1 - https://redd.it/68omuu

Im crying writing this. You probably guessed it already; something happened to the camera. 

Look, I saw what happened because it streamed to my phone. You guys cant see because the footage never made its way onto my computer.

Fuck, so I downed like 5 coffees even though I hate it. I sat up and I waited until I saw the light. For those enquiring why my parents havent heard/seen him, their bedroom is on the other side of the house and faces the street whereas mine faces the garden.

When I saw the torch, I quickly switched on the app and began to watch. Tom unlocks the door and walks in. He produces a light bulb from his pocket and replaces the bulb in there which flickers a lot, and then turns on the light. 
Tom chooses a selection of pictures of the wall and sits down on dishevelled rat-chewed sofa. This is when I lost it. He began biting at the wood of the picture frames. He closed his eyes as he did it, briefly opening them to look at the picture. Once hed gnawed enough, he hung all the pictures back up.

I can hardly write the next bit. 

He reaches down to an old plastic bag full of my dress up clothes. He takes out a dress (Hermione Grangers Yule Ball dress to be precise; I was a geek when I was younger and I still kinda am), and begins to strip. When he was fully nude, he puts on the pink dress, its frills barely covering his male body. He stood there, smiling to himself, the sensation being euphoric to him.

I cried. A lot. Thats what hes doing. Fuck. 

I continued to watch, through my stream of tears. Thats when I got the low battery notification on my phone. That meant a light had begun to flash on the camera. Shit. Tom walked over to the flashing light and picked up the camera. He grinned.

You like that? He said, rather salaciously. He continued to laugh in that flirtatious, courteous tone. I shook my head. I know you do.

He began to walk with the camera out of the shed, back over the fence, back into his house. He walked through the house, still thinly clad in my costume dress. He walked into his daughters room, took off the dress and laid it on her desk. 

You cant have it anymore. You arent FRESH enough. He hissed. See you soon.

The camera flicked off and I sat paralysed for a few minutes. Holy shit. I needed to get that camera. I ran downstairs, and I never run anywhere. I ran into the kitchen and froze. Tom, now fully clothed was half over my fence with camera in hand. He threw it down behind him and walked into his garden, calling for Milo.

As soon as I was certain he was gone, I ran outside and got the camera. Hed taken the SD card out, which stored ALL the footage from last night and more. I went back inside and locked the back door. 

I cannot take this. Now he knows that I know what Im doing. Im about to go speak to his wife, Nancy. Ill update on what she said when I get back.

------

This is all off the scale now. My conversation with Nancy wasstrange. 

I took round one of their stray balls that had found its way into our garden. Before she could close the door, I asked if I could speak to her. She uncertainly agreed, and I stepped inside.

I explained everything. The encounters, the chewing, the dressing up, and the video itself. What seemed strange is she didnt seem too bothered by it all.

Tom has always been fascinated by you; youre an amazing young lady. She said, her voice light and soft as a feather. 

I dont think its a good thing that he is fascinated by me, Nancy. What he said on the video sounded hostile. I replied, with a scoff. How dare she brush this off and pretend like its nothing. 

Tom doesnt hurt you, though. He hasnt gone that far. He just cares about you. Our daughter doesnt give the same kind of love, or so Tom says. Nancy replied. Now, this reply baffled me. It was almost like she was ENDORSING his actions. How could she endorse what he does?

Does he hurt you? I said.

Nancy nodded. Tom is a perfectionist; he loves when things are exactly how he likes them. I am not perfect, and nobody is. Youll be okay. Youre perfect.

I am not perfect. I dont get good grades. Im not that pretty I dont think. What the hell is perfect about me?
I must say I am shocked he goes in the shed. Thats invasion on your property. Maybe Ill stop him doing that. Just leave him be; hes a tortured soul.

Fuck you, Nancy. That man is fucking obsessed with me and you expect me to leave it be? Im gonna call the police.

I took my phone from my pocket, and dialled 999.

She grabbed my wrist, and the look in her eyes told me to stop, to listen. Her voice lowered to a desperate whisper. Dont call the police. Hell kill you. And me. And everyone. He told me if he;s going to prison he might as well do it in style.

I pulled away. I am not letting this carry on Nancy. If hes hurting you-

I heard Toms car pull up.

Go, go now. Nancy said, directing me out the back door and over the dreaded gap in the fence. I stood watching in the kitchen. 

Tom sauntered in, and noticed Nancys distress. He slapped her across the face and then left the room.

I am at a crossroads. Something is very wrong with that family, and that guy. But hes threatened to kill me if I tell the police. I know I need to tell the police, but I dont want to risk my damn life.

Ive jammed the shed lock so he cant get in. Maybe thatll stop him. Its selfish but Id rather he left me the fuck alone and was weird in his own house. 

Ill update tomorrow, or never depending on whether this stops it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> PART 1 - https://redd.it/68omuu


I waited a while to update because nothing has really happened since the parcel incident. I should probably clear some stuff;
 
-       I directed the courier to put the parcel in my shed, forgetting its usually locked. I reckon he put it outside the shed, and Ive now changed my preferences to that. The main reason that is relevant is because I think Tom came into my garden whilst I was in the house to get the parcel  and that fucking scary.
 
Nothing of importance has happened over the past few days. Tom still comes most nights. Its been raining a lot lately, so I havent seen him as often as usual. Even creeps like Tom care about the weather, bless.
 
I check the shed everyday and nothing is missing. Why is he going in there? Hes not even stealing shit; hes just standing in there. That's weird in its own perverted way. Maybe I need to catch him in the act again.
 
Im starting to desensitise to it all now, sadly. Its become a regular occurrence and Im becoming numb. He isnt doing any harm. Yet. I saw a handful comments that scared me shitless. If were believing the theory that Tom used my dads keys to cut his own, he could easily have keys to our house. I swear to god if that fucker comes into my house Ill have had enough. 

Everything escalated last night; Saturday. As previously mentioned, I went to a party Saturday night, and then back to my friends house to stay the night. The party was far away, and my friend Kate picked my friend Anna and I up to take us to the train station. We took a 45-minute train, walked around the town for a bit, and then took a 20-minute bus to the party.
 
It was fun, but we ended up leaving early and heading back to my friend Rosie's house who lived there. It was a fun, normal night; a bunch of drunk pretty girls in party dresses and telling scary storiesaka a straight male nosleep redditors dream. I actually found some good stories on here to tell, old classics like Betsy the Doll, The Smiling Man and that one about the 911 operator. 

What was nice about the evening was that amongst all this Tom the neighbour shit, I had some form of release. I was at a different house, he wasn't going to jump over this fence that was probably taller than him. Nor could he sneak through her gate; it was locked with a key pad.
 
Rosie had pitched a tent in the garden. Her house is kinda small, and there was like 9 of us staying over, so we decided a tent would be fun. Itd be like camping when we were kids! Rosie put up fairy lights and we all sat round together. We spent a lot of time inside the house as it was warmer. My friend Alice brought her polaroid camera and took a bunch of pictures of us all.

The pictures taken of us werent very flattering. We all had very short dresses on and drunk carelessness added to some interesting photos. We left them inside and headed out to the tent.
 
When I heard it, I couldve shit myself.
 
Everyone was asleep; fast asleep. Most of them had just passed out. I hadnt. I was up on my phone. I heard shuffling from Rosie's bike shed. It was a small shed; enough room for maybe one person to fit in and push the bikes out. I heard the door open and close. I froze for a while, listening to him walk about. My mind didn't go directly to Tom. Why would he be here? My friends house was over an hour away from us, and why would he come? And he couldn't get through a locked gate with a keypad.
 
I nudged Anna, who was asleep beside me. Anna, theres someone outside.
 
She sat up, looking confused. Maybe its Rosies parents or her sister.
 
Its fucking 3am, why would they be up? I was in complete disbelief that she couldnt hear him shuffling about.
 
Look, were just still drunk. Just go to sleep I dont know.
 
Maybe I was drunk. Maybe I was hallucinating. I had no fucking clue what I was hearing. I tried to sleep and I couldnt. The only thing separating this night-time stalker and me was a thin sheet of tent fabric.
 
When everyone got up the next morning, they were awfully hungover. I say they, I mean 'we'. It was awful.
 
Alice began flicking through the pictures, laughing at our carelessness. She frowned.
Hey, some of these are missing.
 
I looked through them. I was in about 4 of the 10 pictures taken. All of the pictures of me werent there. We searched all round the room for them, but nothing prevailed. Its like someone broke in and stole them.
 
Whilst they all cleaned up, I managed to sneak into the bike shed. All the bikes remained, but the previously dusty window has been cleaned by a hand. I also found my bag that Id left inside, but the contents were missing.
 
Enraged, I stormed out. Who the fuck emptied my bag?! No one answered, just laughed and looked confused. They all spent the morning jokingly accusing each other of it. I said goodbye, collected my other bag that was still full of stuff and left.
 
I left my stuff in the car because I just wanted to get in the bloody shower. I felt tired, and stressed about the possibility that Tom couldve followed me to my friends house. Whyd he take those pictures? This whole thing is starting to freak me out now. I said in my last post I was intrigued to see where this goes, but now I just want it to be over. I am done with this all. Im gonna set up my dads GoPro later to stream to my phone because I want to know what hes doing.
 
Also, let me add that when I went to get my empty bag from the car the next day, all my stuff had been returned! My friends found this hilarious, and declared that I staged the whole event. I went along with this because I am sick and tired of explaining this story. Every time I try, they make up excuses and say Im making shit up. And Im not. I locked that car door; my dad made me. If he got into the car, he has my dad's CAR key too, which is really scary.

What do I do with the footage when I get it? I can't just waltz into a police station and shove it in their face, can I? Maybe I can. Jesus, I just want this fucker out my life. 



Okay, I just set up the camera in the shed. I've locked the shed up, and I even placed some stuff so it's harder to access. A few people suggested I switch out the lock. That's a good idea, if he's doing weird shit. I don't know how I can do that without my dad noticing, also I have no clue how to do that either. I'll do some research. My dad's been talking about leaving his bike in the other shed in our garden (the other shed just has our lawn mower in), because it gets covered in webs in that one. If he does that, I can switch out the locks and they won't notice until they decide to clean it out. 

First, I wanna catch him. The camera on the battery isn't very long lasting. I've set up the camera so I can see what the camera sees. I'll start recording when he enters. My phone doesn't actually store the footage though; that's all on the camera. I'll upload the footage after tonight.

Clear skies tonight. Tom's favourite time. He doesn't like it when it's raining hard, or snowing. Or just cold. He's picky.

Well, I'll update you guys tomorrow.

<TEXT> I honestly don't know. It could've been left outside; and I'm pretty certain it was. I changed my preferences the other day on the courier website to leave parcels in/outside the shed because I didn't want to go round that creep's house and somehow my stuff still ends up in his house. What is scaring me the most is the aspect that in a short amount of time my parcel went from my garden to his house, all whilst I was inside my house.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> PART 1: https://redd.it/68omuu

Hi everyone, thanks for all the comments and supports. Youve made me feel a lot safer than before. Theres a link to part 1 if anyone wants to read that first.

Id like to address some comments first;

-	My dad doesnt have a gun, and jeez I wish he did. Fuck gun laws, I have no protection against creepy ass Tom.
-	The Hughes have NO pets; apart from some fish. No cats, no dogs etc. Milo could be a stray cat, but I live in a rather isolated area so we dont get many.

I feel like I should give you all some background of the Hughes too. Nancy leaves the house at around 6am to go to work. She works as some HR woman I think. Shes nice enough; just hardly around. Ella, their daughter, has epilepsy and is very very sweet with gorgeous, silky ginger hair. She always makes me handmade birthday cards. Never my sister though, we always joke she certainly has a favourite. Tom works as a freelance accountant and works from home most days. 

After reading your comments, I decided to have a look into the shed. It appears to look the same as before; old furniture, broken board games, unused garden tools and lots and lots of pictures. My grandpa is very proud of his camera, and he is a fantastic photographer. He takes too many family pictures, prints them and frames them. You cant fit many pictures in a small house, so we put them up there. Yeah, I guess its kinda weird to walk in there and be stared at by frozen images of your family, but its more thoughtful than the bin.

Ive had a look, but honestly nothing looks out of place. A few of the lower pictures have been gnawed at, but that is definitely the rats. Everything seems normal; the only thing that moves around in there is my dads bike which he takes out on weekends.

I should add too that this shed is locked. My dad locks it to ensure his bike is safe and no creepy guys get in there. Nice try dad. I dont know where hes got the key from. The shed was unlocked the first time I watched him, but every time since then hes been bringing a key. We only have one key for the shed, and my dad keeps it on his key chain. Fuck. Just remembered right now my dad lost his car keys for a few days around the same time THE HUGHES MOVED IN. Did he steal my dads fucking key and get it cut?! Is that possible?

Something happened tonight and I honestly thought at this point Id somehow get hold of a rifle and shoot him. It is getting too much. I need to get evidence to go to my parents; or the police. 

See, I had problems with sleep walking and sleep talking when I was younger. I would have very lucid nightmares, and became terrified of everything around me as I was unsure whether it was my dream world speaking or whether it was real. It was triggered by the death of my grandma, a woman I loved dearly who was a pillar in my life. I actually went to my parents after the first incident with Tom, and they told me theyd talk to him. They actually booked me an appointment with my old therapist. Thanks. That is why I am reluctant to go to my parents without proof. I need to catch him in the act, but hes a tall man in his mid-forties and Im a barely 20-year-old girl who is literally just over five feet tall.. He definitely has the upper hand here.

Anyway, I ordered some dresses last night for a party Im going to on Saturday (theyre all cute btw, I know you dont care though). My order came whilst my family were all out and so was left in my shed. 

When I arrived home, I headed straight upstairs. I stuck my headphones in and got on with work, before getting distracted by 307 messages from my friends about Saturday. I then saw an email pop up; Your parcel has been delivered!

I opened the email, and noted that the parcel had been placed in my shed at 15:44. I looked at the time, which was 15:51. Damn, I mustve just missed them.

I headed downstairs to the shed. I needed to have a look through it anyway, as suggested by you all. Two in one. When I entered, I found no parcel. I had a look round the shed for it and for signs of movement.

Later, when my mum got home, she told me that the package had probably been given to the neighbour. I showed her the email, clearly stating it was put in the shed. My mum said maybe that was just the lazy response of a website who couldnt be bothered to explain the circumstances. She practically shoved me out the door to go knock.

I prayed and wished and hoped with all of my being that Nancy was home. 

She wasnt. Tom opened the door, with his easy, friendly smile. I asked for my parcel, and he asked me to step inside. I took out my phone as he stepped into another room and began to scroll through instagram. I realised a few minutes into my scrolling that he was taking a weirdly long time. 

I was too scared to follow him into the room. I was in his own home! He could do anything. I peered through the crack in the door and saw him furiously trying to pack my clothes away. He was sealing the bags with tape, trying to make it look like theyd never been opened. Ella sat on the sofa across from me. She looked frightened by her fathers chaotic movements. 

Toms head jerked upwards when Ella let out a whimper. I lurched backwards to where I was, and he soon came out the room holding the parcel out to me. I took it back and we exchanged an awkward smile before he let me go.
What the fuck was he doing going through my stuff?! That shit is illegal. Well, all the shit hes doing is illegal, and plain weird. Jesus Christ.

I unpackaged the clothes, and the packaging was practically mauled, but luckily the dresses were fine. I noticed something though. On some of the dresses, usually stuck to the black tape used to repackage the bags, ginger strands of hair were attached. Ellas ginger hair. 

I dont know what to do. Im going to see if I can rig my dads GoPro to work as a live stream-esque thing; pretty sure you can do that. I just need to catch him; get proof that creepy Tom isnt just my childhood memories coming back.

Part of me wants it to go on. Sounds weird but Im so intrigued to find out what that fucker finds so interesting in my shed. Ill definitely put all stops on this if he comes into the damn house. Jesus.

But what does he want? Does he wanna murder me? Steal my clothes? Be me? At this point I have no idea, and Im open to any ideas. Ill update you all if anything else happens.

<TEXT> I'm moving out in a few months and this is all gonna go away but I feel like someone needs to know. I've been reading NoSleep stories for a while, but I've never had the courage to tell mine. I'm terrified, and I really need advice.

I'm going to University in September, which means I'm moving out of my parents house. I'm alone in the house a lot, but I tend to avoid staying alone overnight. Something about going to bed alone and there being no one about to help you if something sinister startles you in the night unsettled me; so I tend to stay with friends or have them stay over.

My house is in a small village in England, and when I say small I'm not exaggerating. There's a population of about 1,000 and it feels like the houses are invading on the property of nature, rather than the other way round. My house backs onto seemingly endless fields, separated from my back garden with a flimsy wooden fence. My parents moved here because it was quiet and there's never any problems with crime or anything. It seems perfect. And I cannot let the eerie goings on here eradicate the beauty of this little village. Rolling fields and forests of such beauty are difficult to find anywhere else other than here, and up until a few years ago they were just that.

Our road is a short dead end road with about 9 or 10 average sized houses. My neighbours on the left are old but still work. They have a fat dog who has seizures sometimes and the wife has cancer. They are irrelevant to my story. The other neighbours are the problem. They are a small family; two parents and a 8-year-old daughter called Ella Hughes. The parents, Nancy Hughes and Tom Hughes, are nice enough. They always contribute flapjacks to our annual road party and they are active members of the local church, which they attend every Sunday. 
They moved in shortly after us and we welcomed them kindly. My sister used to play with Ella when they were younger, until she decided she was more like 19 than 9. She stopped going around when I was about 15, and my sister was 10.

I always found it strange that we could see into their garden. In England, almost every house has fenced off gardens. We have a conservatory (a glass room) on the side of our house, and then a small path around it to our back gate. The Hughes fence is strangely low at one point, which they told us was because they didn't have enough wood. This was normal enough; they had high hedges that blocked off the rest of the garden. But there was still a good 5ft of low fencing that meant that from inside the conservatory I could see their back garden. 

It was an average back garden, with the typical derelict British trampoline due to the bad weather, and a small gardening patch where Nancy grew strawberries and sometimes potatoes.

Sometimes I'd go downstairs at night, and I'd hear noise from next door. Looking out, I'd see Tom walking around the garden in a weird fashion. He looked as if he was searching for something. I just assumed he'd lost something; they used their garden a lot.

The first big event was during the winter. I'd be studying hard for the mock exams I had the next day. It was around 1am and I'd just finished atomic structure, and I was fucking thirsty. I headed downstairs as quietly as I could to ensure no one else woke up. 

Half asleep, I watched the water pour into my glass, listening to the clock tick repeatedly. My boredom caused me to turn to the left, and my stomach dropped. I saw Tom standing by the short fence looking over. As our eyes locked he walked backwards, produced a torch and began looking around his garden and calling 'Milo', as if he was calling a dog, apart from the Hughes didn't have a dog. I was frozen, my glass overflowing, as I stood watching Tom. Every so often, the torch would come over the fence as he swept over the garden, and it'd linger for a second, catching me in its light.
I clutched my glass and ran upstairs. I couldn't turn off the lights, and my parents were so angry at me for leaving them on. 

The event shook me for a while or so. I couldn't go downstairs at night in fear I might see Tom. I began drinking water from our upstairs bathroom, which wasn't supposed to be drank. It made me sick sometimes, but it was better than facing the man downstairs.

My parents decided that on their anniversary in May, the year after this happened, they wanted to go away for a weekend. My sister headed off to her friends. I was too sick with the flu to go to a friend's house or have a friend over so I decided to brave it alone. 

I was 3 seasons into Criminal Minds, when I realised it was 2am. I realised I hadn't turned the lights off downstairs or locked any of the doors. Walking downstairs, suddenly the memories of Tom and his torch washed over me and I froze. I knew I had to lock the doors. He could come in. He knew I was home alone; my parents had asked Nancy to keep an eye on our flowers in the front yard and let me know if they needed watering. She might've told him. Shit.

I raced downstairs and locked the front door first. I ran towards the conservatory and then froze. There was Tom, slightly suspended over the fence. We made eye contact, and I felt my eyes prick with tears. He looked calm, ready. He locked eyes with me for a painfully long time. Well, I don't know how long it was. It felt like hours he stared at me. He then landed back in the other side of the fence, still keeping his eyes locked to mine. He produced a torch, began to sweep the guardian, and call for 'Milo'. Crying, I locked the back door. Tom froze as he heard the door lock, and he turned off the torch and stormed inside. 

It's like he knows. He knows when I'm vulnerable, and that's when he acts. Or maybe every night he comes over the fence, and I'm catching him whenever I'm there. 

I haven't gone downstairs a lot. And when I do, I keep my eyes away from the fence and turn every light on as I go. I'm afraid that me not noticing him has caused something else.

Later that year in September, I was day at my desk doing work late one night when I saw torch flashes out my blinds. 

As I began to shake, I stood up and peered out my blinds. Tom was walking across our garden with his torch in hand towards the our shed. The shed is big, more like a summer house (a small one room cabin). When we were younger, we'd have friends round in there and it'd be our house in roleplay games and bases in It or Tag. But now, it was full of rejected furniture and family pictures that we didn't want in the house but were too sentimental to throw away.

Tom, opened the unlocked door and walked in. I called out to my parents, who did not react. He was invading private property; at this point I had to tell someone. I called out repeatedly; desperate for someone to wake up. He heard me. He bolted out of the summer house with his arms full of something and back over to the fence. I screamed out again.

My dad came in, bleary eyed and hardly awake. "What's wrong?"

"Fuck, Tom from next door just went across our back garden into the shed." I said. My dad laughed.
"You really need to get to bed early, love." He hugged me, because by this point I was shaking and crying. It was the first time in months I'd seen him, and the memories of him climbing the fence and looking at me made me shudder. I pleaded for my dad to listen but he just laughed. It was no use.
Every night, when I'm awake, I see the flash of a torch in my back garden. And every night when I go downstairs, I see him in the corner of my eye getting ready to come over, or maybe just sauntering about his garden on his way.

I don't know what to do. Please help me.
