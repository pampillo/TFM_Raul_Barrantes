<TEXT> Have to agree with you on Mike's story line. He's such a great character. But you're right, it would seem a bit forced yeah. Could be that Hank and Gomez go order some chicken at Los Pollos. Even a scene like that would be enough for me. Must say, I like that they keep us wondering when they drop hints like that. It's the only universe from a series that I spend a lot of time on. </TEXT>

Usually the women back home would have to make and send these tapes by mail as his music was banned over here at one stage. It was actually more of a shock to us that he didn't know he was famous.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Web developer here. PHP is an excellent start. If you really keep at it and use your free time to learn more you'll be raking it in within 4-5 years. I was earning minimum wage as well at 28. Today I'm 32 and making about 60k a year. Was a shit ton of hard work but it paid off. Last piece of advice would be if you're doing PHP, get to know a bit of front-end as well. As long as you know the basic with FE, you're good to go. Good luck!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agree with what you said. My theory is that:

1) it's also a clue into the black and white "Cinnabon" scenes. Maybe down the line close to the end of the series he gets arrested and jailed. The Cinnabon job could be some parole condition. When he hesitates to open the emergency exit it shows that he's turned his life around. The evolution from Slippin' Jimmy to Saul Goodman to Good Guy Saul.

2) The Cinnabon job is his escape to obscurity (now on the run) and knowing that the police will come when he opens the door, he doesn't want an authority figure to maybe recognize him?
