<TEXT> Unfortunately, some coaches are super young and/or inexperienced and don't recall (or understand the intricacies of) being new to fitness. They don't go to sensitivity training. And most of them learn "on the job", so to speak. 

I'd tell them that you're trying to work through an injury and even ask them if they know of another exercise you can do in place of the hang clean bc it bothers your shoulder (if they're new to coaching or not very well-versed with the movements, they probably will stutter through something and not give you a satisfactory modification. If they know their stuff, they'll probably say something like "do THIS" and maybe they'd demo it and watch you to make sure you're doing it correctly and maybe they'd throw some anatomy terms in there as well!). 

And just to play devil's advocate, sometimes new people are doing the movement really well and it's super obvious they can add weight. So if you're beating everyone during the workout and have great form .... then the coach might be unaware of your injury and is just trying to push you out of your comfort zone. 

But, again, sometimes you get some lughead coaches that only care about quantity and not quality. </TEXT>

I was a serious reader during high school and middle school but boy oh boy did my reading tastes change between 17 years old to 25/26 years old! I was kind of at a lost at what type of reader I was. It took a lot of hits and misses to find my "grown up" genre.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's just straight from the romwod website 

Because of how it is designed to work with your body, ROMWOD can be done just about any time. Athletes can do it first thing in the morning, an hour before training, 5 minutes before training, after work, or right before bed. Regardless of when it is done, the benefits of ROMWOD come from doing it consistently over time. That said, most begin to feel improvement in their range of motion as soon as they start the program.

We do not recommend doing ROMWOD right after training when you are extremely warm. This system is meant to be done when the body is cool.

https://romwod.com/faqs/

But it seems like RIGHT before isn't ideal either.

<TEXT> Regarding donating books to the library ... as far as i know, they cant add books that people donate to their collection. So the library will just re-sell them. And then the library can use the money from selling donated books/comics to buy new books. But my library sells donated books anywhere from $0.50-$2, so that kind of pushes me to just donating them to goodwill or reselling my better books back to amazon or ebay.

but an audio only yoga class is probably going to talk even MORE than most other versions bc they assume the practitioner will need even more instruction bc the visual isnt there.

<TEXT> What towel do you have? I prefer YogiToes ... they run about $60 (you can find them cheaper on ebay ...) but I have okay luck with them during a hot yoga class. My Gaiam ones or the $20 ones from Target have all basically useless. For hot yoga, I cheap out on my mat ... I'm using the towel in all my classes so I dont need $50+ yoga mat ... 

I prefer to have more clothes on sometime during a hot yoga class. When we have to hold onto another body part (like an ankle during bow pose), I think it's easier to grip onto legging than sweaty ankle, but that's me. 

I also bring a hand towel (like a dish one) to blot myself. But if my towel happens to get slick (which this has really only happened once that I can remember during down dog), I have used that on TOP of my yoga towel. 

And, at the end of the day, it's a hot yoga class. It's okay to sweat. Sometimes it was just me getting used to sweating. Hydrate well before. 

Also, they have all shades of hot classes. I know places like Corepower have about 85 degree rooms. That's just a barely hot day. It's not that bad. Then there's the 97 degree places, that's where I mainly hang out, preferably just 45 minutes. I've done a few 100+ ones ... and I honestly just hate those. I accidentally took one that was an hour long and I spent half the class in child's pose!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One thing that will help is to make sure you're not stopping at the rib space when you inhale. So fill the BELLY with breath, have it travel up the spine (into the rib/chest area) and then fill up the rest of the clavicle. 

What makes this tough is when you're in a forward fold (and you're tight in the legs and rounding the back a lot), you're probably shortening the front of the body ... which makes taking deep breaths difficult. If this is the case, you need to watch your ego and use props or come OUT of the pose a little bit so you can keep the front of the spine longer and you can take those deeper breaths. 

And then, if that still doesnt work, it's okay to breath normally for a bit and then get back into it. Or adjust the count with something similar that works for you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love that you randomly bought a book after a night of drinking! I find myself doing super responsible things when I get home drunk, but not sleepy, including but not limited to - hiding money in my room so I dont spend it later, showering, painting my nails, putting up my socks. 

Secondly, I listened to H is for Hawk on audiobook and it was one of those books that really surprised me. The author narrated her own book (and that's always fun with audiobooks bc you get the intonation and stresses that they wanted on the words). The book was well written and great to read, I just really loved it! I guess it helped that I wasnt expecting much. 

And to answer your actual question, I always find books referenced in other books that I'll write down to check out later. I'm reading Buffering by Hannah Hart (she's the My Drunk Kitchen youtuber) and she references a book her psychiatrist talked to her about called Driven to Distraction ... about ADD.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've read some "heavy" nonfiction and I think some of them just get too far in the weeds for me to find enjoyment from reading them. So these suggestions are what I view nonfiction-lite. I think they're enjoyable and accessible for most people 

Laura Hillenbrand's books read like fiction! She is great at making the book feel like it has a beginning, middle, and end. (thats my main gripe with Erik Larson ... he just doesnt tie everything up for me. I feel like there should be MORE, I never get the *So what?* from him). 

I like Bill Bryson. A Short History of Nearly Everything. Some of the stuff he writes seems like it didnt happen bc it's so outlandish. I also really liked One Summer, America 1927 - baseball, planes, and sensationalist journalism. Bill Bryson is a very light-hearted funny writer. 

Mary Roach writes a lot of light-hearted science-y things - Like Gulp (about the digestive tract) and Stiff (about dead bodies). 

I want to read Endurance by Alfred Lansing bc I've heard great things. It's about a ship that gets frozen and stuck in Antarctica for, like, a month. 

There are some things you just can't make up. And they're fascinating to read about! </TEXT>

**Creativity, by Ed Catmull** - this is the story of Pixar and it is fantastic. He talks a lot about managing Pixar, Steve Jobs, and all that jazz. Great for managers! 

**The Wanderers, by Meg Howrey** - man, I didnt like this book mainly bc it got compared to The Martian. But on The Martian, THINGS happened. I felt like nothing happened in this book. It's just a character study within the structure of astronauts and people in tight spaces. If you go in with that understanding, it'll probably ground your expectations on this book a bit. 

So now I'm in between books. 

I have Handmaid's Tale (narrated by Claire Danes) and American Gods (narrated by full cast) on audiobook .... 

But I'm leaning towards **American War, by Omar El Akkad**  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had back issues (mri and neurologist and chiro, the whole deal). When it would get aggravated again, the easiest thing I would do was go to CVS or Walgreens and they have those pads that you stick on your back that make it really hot. That helped me the most after I aggravated it. I would switch it up with ice. I'm sure your not supposed to do that or just do one or the other, but it was the easiest fix for me. The pads are like $1-5 and single use. 

Then when I went back to the gym, I would scale. Scale weights, scale reps ... sometimes I would pull from the blocks instead of the ground or I would completely do another movement that didnt re-aggravate my back. 

There's that ONE time you push beyond your limits coming back from an injury and you end up not going back to the gym for weeks instead of something that could have been a few days of backing off. So just be mindful of your body!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not fiction but I really did like Unbroken by Laura Hillenbrand. She really gets down to the state of airplane flight during the 40s, the POW life in Japan. 

I loved All Quite on the Western Front, but it made me feel sad. Unbroken is a little more uplifting and makes you impressed with the human spirit. So that is a really stark contrast between the books. 

I've also read Redeployment by Phil Klay. And it's short stories about soldiers coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. It might be closer to what you're looking for since it's modern and it's got a super sad twinge to most of the stories! Pretty sure this was fiction but it read like nonfiction.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm currently reading The Wanderers by Meg Howrey. And it was compared to The Martian. Annnd it's not like The Martian, imho. I didnt know it was based on a simulation of going to Mars, so I start it off expecting them to go to Mars. And I just cant get past this fact that I think the characters should be on Mars and not simulating in Utah.

<TEXT> I dont see anything wrong with it. Some people don't wear makeup to the gym and some people do. To each their own. People who exercise and wear makeup do have distinct concerns - how do I not look like a bawling beauty queen with my mascara? fuck did my foundation just ruin this white tank (bc that shit does NOT come off). So I think it's somewhat relevant to people who exercise and wear makeup. I'm not hating on those people who "put on their face" before they workout. And this article might help them out. 

Since no one is asking me for selfies after workouts, it's not such a huge concern for me tho.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Buffering, by Hannah Hart**

This is from the My Drunk Kitchen girl. Her mom was a bit of an odd bird (ie. schizophrenic?) and she got big on youtube before they had all the "how to get big on youtube" tutorials. I heard about it more through the audiobook world (bc I think she narrates it, well). But I saw it at the library and picked up the actual book. 

**The Utterly Uninteresting and Unadventurous Tales of Fred, the Vampire Accountant, by Drew Hayes**

Death and TAXES. I dont know this is just a fun book to listen to. The narrator is really good. And the protagonist, Fred, is a "wimp" by vampire standards but he's got a really good attitude and methodically will help out his friends when they're in need. Just an all around good dead dude. Not from the library, I paid for this ha! 

Edit: ok Hannah harts mom in buffering is not schizophrenic. I'm confused with the mom in hillbilly elegy  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Lincoln in the Bardo, by George Saunders**

Just finished. Ghosts in Purgatory (aka the Bardo) hang out with Abraham Lincolns son in the after life. I can tell it's well-written but a little too avant garde for my taste. 

**The Wanderers, by Meg Howrey**

I was told this was like The Martian but I'm about 25% of the way through and no one is on Mars yet. The book description on amazon says it's about the simulation that is preparing them for their trip to mars. Knowing that would have probably settled my expectations a little bit. Jumps between the three astronauts, their kids and wives, and a psychologists viewpoint 

**Hillbilly Elegy, by JD Vance**

I'm about 3 chapters in. It's less than 300 pages so I can envision this one going fast. A lot of memoir with some facts strewn in so far. But I'm sure you already knew that bc this was a fairly buzzy book. I'm not quite sure why though! It doesnt seem SUPER mind blowing. I'm not sure what I'm missing. Maybe it was just a TIMELY book with the whole Trump thing ... idk </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm in the minority here but I thought the movie wasnt very good. I think people are shocked by the subject matter and not the actual merits of the movie (which, again, the subject matter is horrific). They had SEVEN YEARS to get this movie released and it looks like they put it together in 3 months. The kid actors werent good. There was this dumb instagram filter over the whole movie (Lofi? Sepia?). 

I don't think this movie brought across anything additional or meaningful or symbolic to the matter of child abuse and molestation aside from displaying it on the screen. 

One of the hilights was Aunt Ruth - great acting. But, ugh, even in the last scene, everyone was mumbling. The cop's reaction was implausible. 

This movie was based off true events and that is the real horror. Aside from the subject matter, I don't see what the movie added to the story.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you want to stick it out with your gym and you like your coaches, try another class time. I know different times have different "vibes". 

I left Crossfit for about 3 years and I ended up paying maybe $30 for a gym membership, but I never went. So instead of using all $145 of my crossfit membership, I was using $0 out of $30 of my regular gym membership. I wasnt really motivated to go bc I didnt want to come up with a program, I didnt like their group fitness classes, and I ended up ditzing around the weight room floor for an hour.  I work a lot and make decisions all day. So I found I liked to go to a gym where they just tell me what to do. 

I also had signed up for bootcamp classes. Those I really liked. You make friends. But they end up being about the same price, if not more expensive, than Crossfit! 

But if you take a break from crossfit,  you can always come back when your funds allow.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I read 13 Reasons Why but havent seen the netflix series. 

I *personally* did not like the book. I felt like the main guy (it's been awhile, I forgot his name) was obnoxiously, almost unrealistically nice. And then I found Hannah unlikeable. I didnt "buy" her depression. This book probably gives the general middle school populace the idea to not be dicks to each other, but I dont know if it would reach out to someone who is going through a real depression bc Hannah is not the best spokesperson for that group. 

The subject matter is very serious. I thought the book was a 2 or 3 out of 5 stars but that doesnt mean I think suicide is a 2 or 3 out of 5 issue.

<TEXT> Most gyms are going to make you take some type of elements class, so that will probably last a week or two. Then they're going to try to get you into a contract. Explain that you're a student, you want to try out a gym over the summer, and see which gym is the most reasonable. You can learn basics! It really depends on what your true knowledge base is with fitness. With my experience ... most high school kids graduating have little to zero body awareness unless they were in some type of sport. Most of the 17-20 year olds at our gym seem to really enjoy crossfit! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Core Power is pricy. They offer like a Hot Fusion class and Core Power Yoga I class and Core Power Yoga 2. I think they do a lot of abs. And most of the classes are heated. They use weights in one of their classes (maybe the yoga sculpt?). Core Power is geared to more, I know I'll get shit here but whatever, "aggressive" yogis. Yogis who might like bootcamp. The classes are good though! It's just a specific brand and I think most of the Core Power teachers have to go through the core power training. My friend goes to this chain out in TX and she LOVES it. She is a 200 hour instructor herself. 

24 hour fitness places are going to vary a lot in their quality and content. I call this "gym yoga". It's probably not going to have "om"s and probably not going to have 1.5 hour long classes that you'd find at a studio. Youll probably do sun salutations, do planks, and maybe do a yoga trick or two. 

I have a pass to Core Power, I was going to try it out! You can get a free week pass to CorePower straight off their website if Im not mistaken. https://www.corepoweryoga.com/free-week

<TEXT> I went to the Haramara Retreat in Sayulita Mexico. I went with a studio already going. We went during an off season and it was really hot. Because youre in a cabana facing the ocean, there's no AC obviously! A lot of crabs and scorpions (you slept in a mosquito netting). But it was honestly an unforgettable experience! We had some day trips for surfing, riding horses on the beach, local shopping, went to puerto vallarta for a yacht trip, you can get massages on site. And there's a chef on site who makes you great, natural food. 

Maybe check out [their retreats](https://haramararetreat.com/upcoming-retreats/) and join in on another group already going? 

edit: I should say that we saw one scorpion and heard about another one in another cabana, this was over 6 days.... so it's not like an every day swarm occurence.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a herniated disc and I did body weight workouts. They included hinging though. 

But I did box step ups. pushups. airdyne. farmer carries ....

later on, I added light kettlebell swings, squats holding a slam ball, single leg deadlifts (with kettlebells)

The programmer at my gym gave me 3 sets of "wods" to do on one day. Then the next day I would do another set of 3 other workouts. I just alternated those for about a month. And then next month, I did another set of workouts that he came up with. Because I was pretty limited with what I could do, I came during my regular class time and then just did my workouts on the side. It got me moving again! 

I also did some restorative yoga at a yoga studio about 1x a week.

My neurosurgeon told me he didnt want me hinging then twisting ... so my injury seems to be different than yours. Good luck with everything!

<TEXT> If you're not flexible, I would buy yoga blocks. You gotta put your ego aside and actually use them. But part of that is finding an instructor that knows when to conveniently cue them.

Personally, I'd try out YogaGlo for a month. They have a ton of videos, better organized, for beginners. The instructors cue well. 

The blocks will range anywhere from $3-15. I'd buy two. You can use a towel for a blanket. And then use a towel or belt as a yoga strap. After the free week, yogaglo is maybe $18/month, less than one yoga class at must studios. Or it's like 3-4 lattes at Starbucks. And you basically get unlimited yoga. 

The free route? Take whatever yoga class you like on YouTube. Then I would pick one pose and YouTube "[insert yoga pose] modifications" and see if you can pick up cues that make sense to you as you build your yoga base.  </TEXT>

I dont know man this book was just awful. I was 27 when I read it and the book is just a bunch of 25 year olds crying about why their life sucks. No research or anything, just pull the WHINIEST kids off the street and have them complain. And then the authors don't give you great advice. The whole book is just "woe is me" interviews.

<TEXT> Yes, and this is really helpful when grabbing weights when the movement pops up again. You can look at the reps and your weight and get an idea if you need to go heavier or lighter or stay the same. I felt like my first few months of Crossfit was me not knowing what weight to grab. Because looking at other people's can lead you down a bad workout path! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most Crossfit is a community ... and no one is going to be more possessive of that than an owner and their box. Their coaching needs differ; their clientele differs. Some boxes might be desperate for coaching and more classes, others are probably just fine where they're at but might want a sub. 

I'd definitely do more listening and hear what the owner wants out of you first. You might have to invest a few hours of work for not a lot of payoff. But I think going about this the right way would be keeping  your goals for his gym in the background at first. But if he says something that opens up the discussion towards weightlifting and your ideas, definitely speak up! </TEXT>

<TEXT> If it's nagging back pain, there's a reason why. Agree with other people to go see medical community and see if they can pinpoint what is going on. My only other advice would be to look into body weight options and stay away from back squat, deadlift, etc with weights until the discomfort goes away. Because the last thing you want to do is to have an injury or mechanical issue and add weight to it.

<TEXT> I always seem to suggest The Troop by Nick Cutter. It's horror (like body horror/gore). About boy scouts and their scoutmaster going to an island for camping and then a very very ill man walks onto their camp and the fun begins. It's a light read, the kid characters are fairly fleshed out and easy to differentiate. 

Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi (? not sure on the name) is a completely different mode. It follows the lives of two African families throughout the generations. I had to write a little tree to keep track of every body bc the book switches POV every chapter. But the stories are SUPER interesting and tragic! I was riveted. I think that would be an interesting departure from the GoT series. You still have some of the family/lineage strife but from a different perspective.  </TEXT>

I liked an Astronaut's Guide to Life by Chris Hatfield. And I also liked Billy Crystal's memoir. The first was interesting and science-y. The Billy Crystal one (and I have never really found him that funny) was actually hilarious! He does his impressions and it's a really great experience on audiobook!

You can also stay seated in your office chair and just lean onto your thighs in like a seated forward fold. 

And you can do great neck stretches. Bring your left arm behind your back and grab the wrist with your right hand. Then work on slowly moving your head around and explore the area.  </TEXT>

I've been at the same part of the story for about 3 weeks now.

<TITLE> In Honor of World Poetry Day, What's your favorite poem or line from a poem? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-21 17:43:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Poetry reaffirms our common humanity by revealing to us that individuals, everywhere in the world, share the same questions and feelings. Poetry is the mainstay of oral tradition and, over centuries, can communicate the innermost values of diverse cultures.

One of the main objectives of the Day is to support linguistic diversity through poetic expression and to offer endangered languages the opportunity to be heard within their communities.

The observance of World Poetry Day is also meant to encourage a return to the oral tradition of poetry recitals, to promote the teaching of poetry, to restore a dialogue between poetry and the other arts such as theatre, dance, music and painting, and to support small publishers and create an attractive image of poetry in the media, so that the art of poetry will no longer be considered an outdated form of art, but one which enables society as a whole to regain and assert its identity.

<TEXT> I've read both Grady Hendrix books - Horrorstor and My Best Friend's Exorcism. Horrorstor is about employees trapped in a haunted IKEA-like store. My Best Friend's Exorcism is about two friends in high school and their relationship as one of them becomes possessed. I liked My Best Friend's Exorcism better bc the 80s references had me laughing early on. These are less horror and more humor. 

The Troop by Nick Cutter is more body/gore horror. But it's a fun horror read. Not much humor but the kids are unique personalities and the setting is easy to picture. I imagined the author had a sense of humor when writing the book. 

I don't know too much about sci-fi horror ... but I think the Grady Hendrix ones are pretty fun comedy-horror books. They're silly though! Don't expect horror Shakespeare  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Book Thief for the following reasons: boring (most books set in this era are interesting and exciting), characters that didn't change, self-important prose that didnt make sense or was overwritten. And the choice of Death narrating added almost nothing significant to the story (which is why you often hear other people who don't like the book say Death as the narrator is merely a gimmick). 

I've heard the author intended this book to be adult fiction, but it's marketed as teen fiction bc it does well in that category. I read this before a lot of the hype started coming out. And the more people started raving, I kept thinking "did I miss something?" And my dislike for the book over the years has turned into hatred ... 

Also hated The Curious Dog in the Nighttime. I really liked Rosie Project though .... 

Not a fan of Kingkiller Chronicles and RPO but those are talked about on this sub quite a bit.

I felt like when I was looking for my 2nd gym, the going rate was around 160-250 for my area (Im in the suburbs of Atlanta). And the fundamentals classes last about 2 weeks. Typically 3-6 classes and you have about 2-4 people in the class.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, so many people are awful when they begin. Set your ego aside in the beginning and work on the basics. Do manageable weights (dont grab what the guy next to you is grabbing). When doing skill work, grab a coach that's just hanging out and ask them to check out your next practice lift so you can get that coaching that crossfit offers. Coaches are people too and sometimes they get glamoured by the bigger lifts and their "friends" in the class, so you have to sometimes fight for that attention if you're new. It sucks but it's a reality. With you being tall, any weird thing youre doing with your body is probably super visible. You have longer levers and you just want to start off with a good base so when you start adding weight, it's not arms and limbs flying everywhere and torquing and twisting things that dont need to be torquing and twisting in those directions! 

Good luck you're not alone in this.  </TEXT>

I remember growing up in the late 80s, in health class we learned about both type of diabetes (and plus Stacey from the Babysitters Club had the genetic diabetes), so it's weird/culturally interesting that nowadays people automatically assume you have the adult onset type. 

They just found out my friend's child has type 1. It was a huge adjustment for them. Neither parents had diabetes, and I never heard my friend really talk about diabetes in her family. So it felt like it came out of nowhere. She was about 4 when she was diagnosed. My mom would babysit her and she would always talk about her head feeling funny. Then one day they had to rush her to the hospital bc she had some type of fainting spell.  </TEXT>

If the gym is older and/or they already program some type of Rx and scaled version, I woudlnt automatically assume it's an unsafe gym if they dont mandate a fundamentals class. 

If a member can make a time slot for regular class time but cant make the limited time options for the specific fundamentals class, are you going to just turn away all those potential members?   </TEXT>

They also had a facebook group (just for the new you) where they talked about nutrition and food. That seemed to be a big part of the work!

<TEXT> I feel like most of the Rx people at my gym didnt really get past 8 minutes of 17.3. The video that CrossFit HQ put out [by Nicole Carroll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDQyzlp-HuU) included tips for this workout. She suggested it was a pulling workout. And I think for most Rx people, it IS. 

I did scaled. And most people, doing scaled, are going to make it out of 8 minutes. So after watching this video, I tried to not use a lot of my arms with the jumping pullups. But my legs were jelly when I got to the later rounds of scaled. I didnt trust them when I did my snatches! Jumping pullups seem like such a joke but I had to break mine up when I got to the 3rd round! 

Next time I think I won't use Rx strategy videos going into a scaled Open workout ... thoughts?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anyone doing Rx, I'm going to ask them to show me their squat snatch. If they're catching it high and I see that pause above parallel, I'm going to tell them that's a no rep beforehand - so they don't get surprised during the workout. Like you chose to do Rx, so do Rx. But if they catch at parallel and then get the depth with the bounce, I'm not gonna split hairs. No ones going to regionals that I'm judging. 

It's really the scaled people busting out their jumping pull-ups and not starting at extension that will be more difficult for me to call bc they typically go fast ...  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just joined my first league. Im like a 2.5 with the USTA rating, I think. I have a tennis court in my condo area but no one to practice with but we do have a small wall to hit the ball against. Do you have any good drills to just get all around better?! Youtubes would be nice. If I hit a ball over the fence it goes into a creek and I only have like 4 tennis balls and I seem to lose one ball every half hour if I'm practicing far away from the wall, so I'm looking for advice and tips and maybe other drills to do against the wall. Thanks.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I saw this question on Goodreads ([here](https://www.goodreads.com/book_movie_challenges/show/6172), if you're interested) to promote the movie The Shack ... I searched for reddit's thoughts and didnt find a thread on the subject! 

For me, it was Burial Rites by Hannah Kent. The author described this dreary, stark version of Iceland in the 19th century. So unfortunately I'd have to time travel! But I could feel the ice in the air and hear the ocean. Even though the book was a sad journey, I've never had as much wanderlust as I had reading that book. 

Even though I didnt go anywhere, that was one book where I *really* felt the setting.

<TEXT> One of the problems can be the judging. It's REALLY hard to no rep someone who is maybe half an inch above parallel and you're not SURE if they're low enough and they're stronger than you so they're PROBABLY doing it right it doesnt matter anyways bc they've done 10 other wall balls while you've been debating this in your head. 

The best way to get better at judging is to actually do it. I have judged competitions before and messing up and knowing how to quickly and effectively tell someone they've no repped ... knowing what are the most likely ways someone will no rep a rep ... exactly knowing the standards ... and then using it in real world application and not the video standard,  it's made a world of difference. 

So in regards to the cheating ... if you're an athlete you might not even realize you were doing shitty reps bc you had a shitty judge.

<TEXT> Scale scale scale! 30# for you is a LOT different than 30# for someone who is 180# and has been relatively fit and strong their whole life. 

When I started, I was at 2 days a week. But my mistake was that I would not really do anything on my days off. So I just stayed sore between my crossfit visits. I upped it to 3 days a week and I actually starting seeing results in that I wouldnt be so sore ALL the time. 

And I would choose much lighter weights than a lot of the people at the gym. You're new, you're smaller, you're learning. It's YOUR body, you have to deal with the consequences of the workout. Write down the weights you use and smiley face or a frowny face next to it, depending on how you felt afterwards. Was it manageable or too much? If you're finishing after everyone or hitting the time caps a lot, go lighter or do less reps. 

If your gym has an issue with that, you can find another one that understands how to help people who are new to this type of exercise. 

Good luck!

<TEXT> Thanks for your reply! I herniated a disc (like over a year ago) and I think that finding a good treatment plan after (and going to a gym that understands injury and how to design and scale for you) is essential to getting back moving. 

I had a lot of luck with active release and was very glad when a chiro I tried out implemented it. I had been going to someone just cracking my back. I'd go in and out in 15 minutes. My new person sees me for 30-40 and seems to do little to no bone adjustment and does a lot of the active release techniques. And the neurosurgeon was able to diagnose me ... but the treatment plan from those guys is surgery, shots, wait it out, pain meds, etc. So it's nice to have someone be like ... oh, you have a tight psoas - try these exercises. 

I did 17.1 scaled and my back is sore but I definitely don't feel injured! But would I do it again to get a better time? Hell no.  </TEXT>

He was a little shit growing up in South Africa. He didnt quite fit in but he has a great, interesting life story. And I didnt know anything about apartheid and I learned so much while laughing. 

I also have Shoe Dog by Knight on my to-read list! 

Broken by Laura Hillenbrand has a great narrator and the story of this guy's life is AMAZING. But it's WWII, so that might not be your cup of tea. It's a serious read, and Zamperini was a POW, an Olympian, a pilot, and lost at sea for a month.

<TEXT> When that guy was talking to Daryl (I forgot his name), it seemed like he was going to attack Negan's group, lead a trail of weapons back to Carol's place, and then have Negan exact revenge on Carol to inspire Ezekiel to join in officially against Negan.

Then Daryl was like "No." 

But then Daryl seemed to want to keep Carol in her house, by herself, by not telling her that Glenn died? 

My group watching the show made it seem like Daryl was like ... leaving Carol out there to fend for herself. He wasn't protecting her from pain, like he was leaving her there bc she's given up essentially and like he cut her off. 

Because what's going to stop that guy from going with his plan alone? He seems pretty determined.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didnt have an ACL tear but I did have a back injury (disc herniation) that really threw me for a loop over a year ago. 

I talked to the gym owners I taught at and explained I wouldnt be able to demo poses, but I asked if I could use some of the students to demo if the class needed demos. And so we found subs for classes where it just was not feasible for me to teach. Lucky for me, I have never really done yoga when I teach it, I can talk through most of the class (we had a thread about this awhile back). So it actually wasnt a huge change for my students. The gym people in charge have taken a few of my classes so they knew my style of teaching fairly well, so they ok'ed me to teach, using students to demo if I needed to. I explained what was going on to the class (and they were awesome about it). 

And teaching yoga happened to be the easiest part of that journey! The gym and the students were all great about the whole thing! 


And, going through an injury like that, it can make you a more sympathetic yoga instructor for sure. Good luck with your journey! You might have tough parts but I've seen plenty of people make it through with grace!  </TEXT>

I have a hard time with Erik Larson as well at times. I actually prefer like Laura Hillenbrand bc I think she makes the stories read more like fiction than Larson. But Larson does some great research.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **A Monster Calls, by Patrick Ness**

Got this from the library bc they had it and I remembered being like, "Isnt this a movie?" I knew where the book was heading but I ended up bawling like a baby during the last part anyways. 

I also cried during my previous book, Born a Crime by Trevor Noah. It was all shits and giggles and then I get to one part and just bawling during that too. It was on an audiobook so I was driving at the time, looking a hot mess on my commute.

<TEXT> I knew some people liked SJ Watson's before i go to sleep (which actually became a movie starring Nicole Kidman ... but I dont think many people saw it). It got a lot of comparisons to Gone Girl (before GIrl on the Train came out). I read it though and the plot kind of  reminded me of Memento. But the characters were kind of meh to me. I enjoyed reading the book though. 

Good Girl by Mary Kubica was another book I put on my to-read list after Gone Girl, but I've never read it. 

I really liked the unique characters in Gone Girl. And I really found that in Descent by Tim Johnston. He writes great characters and the story is a bit dark. 

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Love audiobooks narrated by the author, especially comedians and memoir type books. 

Currently listening to Born a Crime by Trevor Noah. 

have also listened to: 
- Bill Bryson, basically a nonfiction writer. He doesnt have a great narrator voice but by the end, I really liked him narrating. 

- Billy Crystal, I am not a true Crystal fan. Growing up I'd always be like "ugh, this guy again?" when he'd host the Oscars. I tolerated him bc he was in Princess Bride. But his audiobook was fantastic! Very sentimental and actually funny man. He does his Muhammid Ali impressions and you CANT just get that experience reading the book. 

- Aziz Ansari Modern Romance. Great listen. Laughing like an idiot in my car. 

- Amy Poehler, she's very nice and I found her sweet. But she doesnt really have any PUNCH to the audiobook. 

- Jenny Lawson - her voice actually was very distracting and off-putting. This book was the one with the squirrel or rodent reaching it's arms out and it got a lot of high praise within the audiobook community. But I didnt like the book at all. 

-  George Carlin, which I've read his books and it's just not the same

- Chris Hadfeld (the astronaut, I loved this one!)


Those are the ones that I've either listened to recently or they stick out for various reasons. I'd love to listen to Neil DeGrasse Tyson. I feel like his would be a wonderful listen too bc he's such a great host and tv interview.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can just tell you my experience ...

I paid like $4000 for a 200 hour course. It included books and free attendance to the studio's yoga classes. And we had Saturday and Sunday all day training for, god, what felt like months. 

At the end, we did a demonstration that we could talk through sun salutations (basically), we had a ceremony, got our certificate and that was that. My point is - my studio wasnt that picky about the TYPE of yoga you taught, but could you demonstrate teaching poses safely. 

Are you trying to get certified through a Yoga Alliance place? Or some special certification that is like YogaFit or DDP Yoga? Or are you doing like a Mysore thing? If your goal is to teach at a typical studio ... wouldnt said studio want you to mention "traditional" yoga? 


I'd ask them to be more specific about why you're not passing. Would they like to see more alignment cueing? Different class setup? What do they NEED to see from you? You paid them, so they can give you better feedback. 


Is the organization asking you to go to more training and workshops that THEY run (like, are they just trying to get your money)? Are other people in the class going through the same thing?  

As for the teaching skills, the way to get that is through teaching. You might can teach at gyms, or at churches, places like that. It just really depends on the owner and what they'll accept in terms of certification.  Maybe say you'd like to be put on a sub list. You can, last resort, post on facebook and see if anyone wants to help you out by taking a FREE yoga class!

<TEXT> With regard to the sensation in the upper back ... I would let go of your toes, shins, calves or whatever your grabbing and just relax the upper body. USE gravity. 

If you're seated and you feel like you're rolling backwards into the tailbone, adjust from your base and roll toward the front of your crotch. If that doesnt help, prop up your hips with a blanket [LIKE THIS](http://media.yogajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/BAS_260_02_fnl.jpg) (ignore her hands). Use gravity to help you with your seated forward folds (like it helps you with your standing). 

Use your arms to lift you up [like this](http://www.yogabasics.com/YB-NEW/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Paschimottanasana8826.jpg) not pulling [like this](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/0a/53/8f/0a538fad13a89d2a6fb9a2c469e4d316.jpg) and not reaching [like this](http://yogakillarney.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Zackforwardbend2.jpg) (you can also see how he's rolled towards the tailbone here. he's NOT using gravity to his benefit. if you look like this, you should roll your hips forward so you are not on your tailbone but towards the bone in "front" ... or use a blanket to prop the hips up.)

You can also try a rolled up blanket under the knees if your hamstrings are the thing tightening up on you. Like this: [Pic](https://sleepysantosha.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_5314-768x523.jpg)

Experiment, go in without judgement (ie, like you already know what the answer is) and see which one stretches the hamstrings FOR YOU ... and not pull on your lower back or upper back. You should feel a nice stretching sensation in the hamstrings, not like a cord is about to pop. 

edit: you do get a stretch in the spine area but Im not trying to split hairs here.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's happened two times for me. Once at a yoga retreat. And once during my 200 hour yoga teacher training. Both times during savasana. 

I was probably stressed during my yoga teacher training. And at the yoga retreat I was having a fun time, so IDK where that one came from. 

But I remember feeling energy in my chest and it traveled up to my head region and the next thing I knew I was bursting out crying. I mean, it came out of nowhere! 

I felt fine after! and I wasnt sad. I tried to google why it happened (and aside from reading "release of emotions" which didnt really tell me anything I already didnt know) and after not finding anything further on the subject, I just appreciated the moment and let go of trying to figure out wtf had just happened.  </TEXT>

I think with Mary Roach and Laura Hillenbrand, people are getting really good at writing interesting, jaw-dropping nonfiction (bc truth is odder than reality sometimes). I love Bill Bryson as well. They're just really engaging authors. 

There's a book I want to read called Endurance by Alfred Lansing - about people on a boat for something like 30 days bc the boat was stuck in ice. 

These books have a gravitas about them because THEY REALLY HAPPENED. And I typically will pick up one or two things from them and spout off random trivia at parties.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I *really* liked the characters. And that made the book interesting for me. I found myself interested from the get-go. The books characters and situations were easy for me to visualize (bc I like movies and celebrity culture at times). 

There are some "fun" things coming up. But are they creepy? Did I feel like anyone's life was in danger? No. I think the book was a lot more light-hearted than the reviews made it seem. There's an air of mystery and weird things going on ... but I wouldnt call it creepy. 

And I can kind of understand why you're feeling this way about the book. The expectations and reviews pumped the book up quite a bit ... 

It reminds me of the movie The Village (by Shyamalan). It got pegged as "horror" so when people saw this gothic romance, creepy movie, they were like WTF .... I think if they went into the movie knowing what it was going to be, the movie would have been better liked. 

Im rambling. 

I personally enjoyed the book. But I didnt go into it with expectations of something it's not. The scariness and pace stays about the same (for the most part). There are fun plot things coming up!

<TITLE> Regarding Selfies + Generic State of the Sub </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-07 18:28:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello! 

**A QUICK HISTORY OF THE SUB AS I, NIKIVERSE, REMEMBER IT**

I was on reddit 5 years ago, flipping through /r/FancyFollicles and *oohing* and *aahing* over all the great hair there. Seemed like I saw a lot of pixie cuts, ombre, etc but I hardly EVER saw curly hair. And I was AGHAST that there wasn't a curly hair sub. So I made it. 

And 5 years later, here we are. 

My main goal was to have this sub a reflection of r/fancyfollicles. I personally love seeing the pictures of beautiful hair. And, if you hop on over to fancy follicles, you'll probably see more than half of their front page with picture content and not text content. So this sub was never intended to be picture-less. 

But it does seem like every few months we get complaints about the excessive, "karma-whoring" of the selfie posts. And I GET THAT. 

In fact, /u/ImaCheeseMonkey and I definitely saw that as an ongoing issue. So we had a suggestion to post your routine along with your selfie. We have tried to enforce this in the past, and it takes a lot of time to do it effectively. 

So we got mods! And /u/dragonfox helped set up the flair so people could just view the "help" posts and see less of the "hair victories". 

But since then, hardly anyone tags their posts with the flair (and this might be a mobile issue ... I understand that is going on as well). So we were going in and tagging posts with flair ourselves. So that got tiring, obviously. 

And then recently, [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/5qhyky/meta_do_we_need_to_have_the_vanity_discussion/) came about. And here we are again. 

I would like to make one comment about a mod here. /u/ImaCheeseMonkey told me she was going on a break. And I fully support her as a moderator because she has done SO MUCH for years on this sub! 

I created the sub, but I do not have the CSS or modding skillz to really properly manage the sub on my own. (like, if you see me comment here, I dont even know how to comment as a moderator and I'll be doing that the first time with this post). 

So this brings me to my next point. 

**MODERATOR HELP**

I NEED someone who can configure automoderator. Mainly, I would like automoderator to police the selfies by verifying the submitter has posted their routine (ie, a comment).  (Can automod even do that? I feel like it can.)

Otherwise, to fully police that rule, it's a person sending messages out to the offenders and deleting their posts if they don't comply, which can be a soul-sucking, never ending, daily task). 




**IN THE MEANTIME**

if you post your beautiful hair, post your routine WITHIN AN HOUR in the comments. I will add this to the sidebar. If not, your post may be removed. This will eventually become a RULE, but policing the sub without additional mod help is not feasible. 

Also, Flair your post. Especially if you're on desktop. 


**Thank you guys so much for your feedback and involvement.** We're not going to make everyone happy. But I feel this community has been created by all of you. I really enjoy learning about how to manage my own hair and seeing all of your gorgeous curls. 


I will keep this thread up for a week. Feel free to comment with what you want to see in the sub, what you like/don't like, a funny comment, and we'll see where we end up. 

edit: changed a 4 to 5 </TEXT>

<TEXT> Live in Georgia. The sun still rose ... so I guess we got that going for us, which is nice. 

But seriously, I feel like the Falcons always do that. They lay off the accelerator at the end of the game (bc they're typically ahead by so many points). And the team will catch up a little bit ... but the Pats caught up too much.

Julio and Freeman did great. Matty Ice went down the field really fast so that probably didnt help the defense catch their breath. 

Next year the stadium will have like ... $2 hot dogs and drinks!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **We Are Never Meeting in Real Life, by Samantha Irby**

I laughed out loud a lot reading New Year, Same Trash. So I got an ARC with this one and it started off hilarious! Now she's touching on her family (grew up poor, alcoholic father, disabled mother) and her depression and her physical ailments and it's getting serious. She's angry, but she's hilarious. I will definitely try out Meaty ... her other book!

**Based on a True Story, by Norm Macdonald**

I had paused reading this book to finish another yoga book I was reading. So I'm returning to to finish it off! Still have about halfway to go. It's hard to separate truth, twinges of truth, and outlandishness but I knew that going in.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my teacher training, I was taught to do mainly verbal. 

Because I've always taught that way, my verbal cueing is pretty decent ... I mainly say that because most of the students dont look confused. I teach a lot of beginners too. Because I'm not a studio, but a regular gym, I try to use words that make sense and not *just* the sanskrit - like high runners lunge. If they're going into a yoga pose, I talk them into the pose, then I will say the name of the pose once they get in. So when they go into it the next few times, I just start saying the name of the pose. 

I think it helps to have a few established people there ... they're usually in the front row. 

BENEFITS: For me, as a teacher, I can see if people arent doing a pose right. They arent craning their neck in down dog to see what's next, getting out of alignment. Also, integrity of the pose be damned, some students will do WHATEVER the instructor does, even if it's probably not the safest, most alignment friendly version of the pose. I think "verbal only" can help students bring their practice to a little more internal space. I can also look around and see if they're bored or maybe I'm working them too hard. 

So I teach in a large studio where people in the back row cant see me anyways. Bc I mainly do verbal cueing, I can walk to the back of the class and see what the "hiders" look like. Then I can demo right next to them pretty easy if they are totally lost. 

I will say, my first times teaching were mainly showing ... so it took me awhile to get here. And I dont "verbal only" so I demo when I need to. But I'm not doing my own yoga practice up front. 

I have done some of the online yoga video things ... bc I use my phone and dont broadcast it to my tv, I also like when I can hear what the instructor can verbally cue me into the pose. When I have to go to my phone to see what's going on, I typically have to pause the video ... 

But Im in NO way trashing on people who do it mainly by show. When Im learning a new pose, I want to see it too! I think people learn different ways and you might prefer one or the other depending on where you're at in your yoga journey.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since each semester brings a new group of students to the practice (new freshmen, leaving seniors), most campus yoga classes are going to be geared towards beginners.  

You'd probably be okay with starting with either one, honestly.

The vinyasa class might move a little faster, but after a few classes of confusion, you'll catch onto more and more movement cues and you'll get better! I personally wouldnt suggest people take restorative yoga to "train" them to get into vinyasa yoga. The classes are different. Vinyasa is moving with the breath and a mainly standing/moving class. Most restorative classes are prop heavy and like taking a long, awesome nap! You're not going to be able to take too much away from a restorative class to get you "prepped" for vinyasa. 

Thats my 2 cents anyways. 

Also, I teach yoga at a 4 year university.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Restorative yoga typically has a lot of props. When you "flow" instead of doing chatarungas and the like, you might just do cat/cow instead of up dog and down dog. 

But Yin is a little more "active" even while being still; the classes typically are not as restful/restorative but more meditative. You do hold the poses for 3-5 minutes. Because you're holding these poses, many of them are seated and close to the mat. Yin is intended to get more into the structure of the body (ie, the connective tissue) and that's another reason you're seated and not moving (for safety). You won't do any sun salutations. The yin poses are similar in style to the "traditional" yoga poses, but they're called something different in yin - so instead of plow pose, the yin name is snail .... 

When teaching yin, I pretty much get them into the pose and say one or two cues, then stop talking. My music wont have words, if you have it at all. 

I think this is a common question so don't let the haters get you down! 

It seems like you're teaching more of a restorative, gentle yoga class, so I would watch a few of those on youtube and see what those classes are like. For most of my restorative, gentle yoga classes I've had a lot of props (like Im talking bolster, 2 blankets, a block ....) so you might be limited in how truly restorative and relaxing you can get them depending on the clientele and the studio/gym's offerings.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fun NYTimes article about Atlanta

[An Evolving Sports City, Atlanta Chases a Championship](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/sports/football/atlanta-falcons-braves-hawks.html)


This city has been teased before, by those Braves behemoths of the 90s, by the Falcons in 1998, even by the Hawks, who went 60-22 two seasons ago before losing in the conference finals. Counting the futility of its two departed N.H.L. franchises, the Flames and Thrashers, Atlanta can claim only one championship  Braves, 1995  across a combined 167 completed seasons.

Yeah, so I'm ready for a Superbowl win!! </TEXT>

There was so much hate (because it hurt!) when we found out. But the city forgave him and you see Vick jerseys around.  I have even rooted for the Eagles  when Vick played for them. He's definitely a birdbro. He can fly with us.  </TEXT>

This is one where I REALLY REALLY REALLY should have got the audiobook. It's an okay read, but I feel like it would be a GREAT listen, especially because it's narrated by Norm Macdonald. It's hard to tell what's true and what is Norm just being silly. Which is part of the charm, I guess. 

**A Wild Swan: And Other Tales, by Michael Cunningham**

This is a short modern retelling of fairy tales. The artwork is fun and great; the stories? they're okay. This was a good novelty read but I wasnt swept up in a whole new world or anything.

<TEXT> I've never heard about this from yoga ... I will say the most I hear about are queefs. And when you're upside down, sometimes things can open up a bit, air gets in .... and then when you turn back rightside up, gravity works (like it always does) and things (as in the air that fell in) fall out again.

Keep your hips high as you come out of the handstand (like drop one leg slowly to the ground) so you're not slamming to the ground as you come out of the handstand. And maybe a smoother transition will help your body keep a little firmer in that area!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's fair for a gym to ask it's clients to show up in clean workout gear and shoes without mud on the bottom of it, etc, I think the odor can be distracting to your other clients. 



We had a similar problem, but the guy in question was one of the coaches. He was also a cancer survivor so no one would expect him to put on deoderant bc he was militant about not wearing it. But I think he started baby wiping and bringing an extra shirt sometimes. 

I think you're completely reasonable with setting boundaries with your client. But be direct. And be kind. 

If you want, you could make a blog post above your workout (when you know she's supposed to be there) commenting on your expectations for the members. "We expect you guys to show up clean and realize you're not exercising in a bubble  ... " I'm sure Google could help you a lot more than me! 

Either way, I do think it's the owner's responsibility ...  the members might make it worse.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am of the opinion that Bret Easton Ellis is a gifted writer. And I've only read American Psycho from Ellis, but I do think it's more complicated than trash or pornography. 

Patrick Bateman accurately portrays a true psycopath. What's the difference in how Bateman murders versus Hannibal Lecter? I wonder if AP is more troubling because the book follows Bateman's perspective. 

Because Bateman is truly psychotic and because he states his murders with about as much affectation as the next guy's Versace suit, I do see the book following a logic of "true" storytelling. EVERYTHING in American Psycho is superficial, and I think Ellis intended on doing that. And because there's really no conscience with the murders, I think that makes the book more "horrifying".

<TEXT> I think some of the SNL writers or other comedians are really awesome to listen to on audiobook - Tina Fey, Norm MacDonald, Amy Poehler, Mindy Kaling, Aziz Ansari and more recently Trevor Noah .... 

I can only listen to audiobooks on my commute .... if I'm cleaning or cooking, I still have a hard time concentrating on the content. And sometimes I think I would absorb more of the material if I actually read the book with my eyes.  

But I've been listening to audiobooks for years now and I know I'm experiencing books I otherwise wouldnt through this medium. NPR and music gets so tiring after awhile. I always have an audiobook going on in addition to my regular reading.  This adds about 10-15 extra books a year to my "read" pile.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up, by by Marie Kond**

I dont know if it's me just being a messy asshole or what but this woman seems like an uptight bitch tbqh. I'm listening to it on audiobook and maybe the narrator has a nasally voice .... Or maybe it was the fact the author threw away all of her family's clothes while growing up bc she thought they didnt need any of it. I'll definitely take something positive away from this book. But I would NOT want to hang out with the author. 

**Every Body Yoga: Let Go of Fear. Get On the Mat. Love Your Body., by Jessamyn Stanley**

This is a yoga book written by the instagram star Jessamyn Stanley. She's interesting in the yoga world bc she's Black, Overweight (and she can do a lot of the poses). THe first part of her growing up and talking about her first yoga class is GREAT.  The pictures of the poses part is take it or leave it for me. She uses un-traditional models - like normal sized women or ones who don't shave their armpits.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just dont insult a novel without reading it first, thats all I ask.

Thank you Faye Weldon! 

This was actually my first book of 2017 I finished. I think the book has stuck around bc it does capture the materialism and selfishness of that whole "yuppie" world. And those are human characteristics that never really diminish ... it just changes over time. 

Also, I think Ron Jonson, in the Psychopath Test, claims that Patrick Bateman is the closest thing to a "true" psycho that he's ever seen in movies or books ... 

And because there's really not another book out there like American Psycho ... I mean, it's hear to stay! I think it's odd how Patrick Bateman idolized Trump and Trump Tower and here we are in 2017 where Trump is our PRESIDENT. Like Bateman IDOLIZED the guy, Trump, and this guy is leading the country. 

American Psycho is here to stay and extremely relevant after a quarter century.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tripod headstands or forearm headstands?  Start from the ground up. 

I think it's important to know where to put the weight in your head ... you want it on the CROWN of the head and not the FOREHEAD. You shouldnt feel pressure in the neck ... put more weight into your hands and your forearms so little to no weight is on your head ... and as you get more confident, maybe add a little more weight to the head. 

And when you do workouts with HSPU, I would use 1 or 2 ab mats and modify the movement until you get through this hurdle.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yoga with Adriene is doing a 30 day yoga thing. 

Esther Ekhart, Sarah Beth Yoga .... also some other youtubers with pretty accessible (ie. beginner), free yoga classes online. 

Romwod will cost you and it is basically yin yoga - where you hold the poses for 1-4minutes. It stretches a lot of the back body and most crossfitters and western people in general, would do some good to stretch out the front of the body. But the pros is that it's 20 minutes and people find that accessible. 

I personally see flexibility improvements with doing some sort of yoga or stretching at least 3 times a week. 

Hope that helps!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pure Drivel / Steve Martin / Comedy / 1998

- See title for content

Thing Explainer / Randall Munroe / Science / 2016 
 
- Randall Munroe explains complicated mechanical things using the most common words. 

Thing Explainer was a great idea that didnt play out well for me in book form. The text was really small and light blue written on a white background. There was no logical flow of where to stop and start reading. And he would say "fire water" which made me have to do some mental gymnastics to understand what the real world thing he was trying to put out there (which was gasoline). And after pages and pages of that, my brain was fried trying to uncomplicate his attempts at uncomplication. Had high expectations bc I really liked What If.

Before the Fall / Noah Hawley / Mystery Thriller / 2016

 - Guy, Rich Guy, (some other people) and Rich Guy's kid are in a plane crash. Guy and Rich Guy's kid are the only two survivors. The book follows the clusterfuck of media attention that follows. 

Another Brooklyn / Jacqueline Woodson / Fiction / 2016

 - 4 African American teens grow up in Brooklyn during the 70's. It was just super well written and read almost like poetry! 

I read about 50 books in 2016. Most of them not published in 2016. My favorites just happened to be published this year! I usually dont get to read recently published items. But I re-upped my library card about 2 years ago and I figured out Overdrive. So both of these books happened to be from the library!  </TEXT>

The Road by Cormac McCarthy was very good but I find I Am Legend is more tense and has me on edge more .... it's just very scary to read!

and about 70% of the way through with **American Psycho, by Bret Easton Ellis**

American Pscyho is over the top so I find it a little hard to take seriously. But the Trump references are kind of funny seeing how his name is popping up in the news again ... 

probably gonna move onto some lighter fare after getting through these reads!  </TEXT>

It's totally not what I expected. Patrick Batemen will methodically go through people's outfits and that is getting repetitive and tiring. But I think that's the point too? He's starting to throw in how the Chinese launderers are not getting the blood out of his suits. And all his shocking murder talk fits right in with the rest of his meandering thoughts. And then his freakin friends are really no better! They're just not murderers. And even though the book talks about recording on VHS and Sony Walkmans ... it still seems quite relevant to the Wall Street culture ... I'm not quite sure what to make of everything just yet though. 40% of the way through. I'm at Evelyn's Christmas party. 

**Embrace the Suck, by Stephen Madden**

Some book I picked up at the library talking about this 40-something male's introduction to Crossfit, I guess? I have only read the introduction so I actually have no clue what it's about.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I dont know if this REALLY fits what you're looking for, but I've had it on my to-read list for quite awhile. It's Red Notice, by Bill Browder. The book seems very well received by amazon reviewers and the topic seems interesting. But it's more post-Cold War and financial/political leaning.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Villeneuve gets it. I heard in an interview he leans towards sci-fi and there's two big projects he'd like to do and everyone is assuming Dune is one of them. If he already has a yearning to do it, THAT would be the guy you'd want to do it. 

Enemy was my favorite movie I've seen in the last few years. I loved Prisoners, I liked Arrival. He's my favorite current director at the moment.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The rule is with this stuff is if it causes pain, stop. 

I had issues with my back just getting super washed out after kb swings. I had a decent deadlift. But my back squat was BARELY above my front squat numbers. And it seemed like I would always ended up having to take a few days off every month to let my back "rest". 

Long story short, I ended up with a disc herniation. I had sciatica and foot drop. Luckily did not have to have surgery. (And you do NOT want to end up at this point! MRI, doctors visits ... holy crap it adds up $$$)

Back pain can have a multitude of causes. So your best bet would be to see someone who is trained with athletic injuries and see if they have anything to offer. After dealing with neurosurgeons, I did not have the foot drop or sciatica anymore, I go see a chiro once a month about. He doesnt do a lot of bone cracking but a lot of myofascial release/ART techniques, and that has really helped me move forward with the healing process and understanding what I can and what I probably shouldnt do in the gym. Because a 20 year old Crossfit coach doesnt know.  </TEXT>

edit: I've also read Unbroken by Laura Hillenbrand. It's an awesome book and an awesome story. Probably really easy to find. But there was a movie released over here directed by Angelina Jolie so if they're a casual reader, they might have already read this one ...  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Once you understand what books tend to turn you off, you know not to pick them up in the first place. I was falling victim to those $0.99-$2.99 books on amazon. And they were almost always the start of series and almost always crap. Now I just know not to even pick one up!

I also thought I wanted to read romance ... after a few of those, I know to stay away! Because I generally do not like romance books. Nothing happens in them. 

Everyone likes scifi ... scifi should be great! I pick up scifi books and realize they're not for me. So I stay away from most scifi.

Doesnt mean I wont ever pick up a scifi or romance book again (or even a romantic scifi book) .... if I hear about a good scifi book, I still might pick it up, I'm just not going to force myself to like the genre. 

As a Completionist myself, I find myself having to understand who I am as a reader (and you just gotta take time to figure that out), to select better books in the first place. 

If you find yourself reading a lot of crap, move along to a different genre!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Tampa, by Alissa Nutting**

Finished this one. It's about a 26-year old teacher who has sexual attraction to teenage boys. Some people hate the book because it's offensive. I thought it was well-written, witty and shocking. It's not a book I'd recommend to friends "hey this book is about a child rapist, check it out!" but I mean, 4/5 stars. 

**A Fierce and Subtle Poison, by Samantha Mabry**

YA book about a mysterious girl who poisons people just by touching them (think plants ... like a poison ivy thing). This rich kid gets caught up with her when his gf is found on a beach, dead. It's the authors first book. I dont love it. I have about 50 pages left so I'm just trying to see what happens at this point. 

**Horrorstor, Grady Hendrix**

<TEXT> I've only read Ocean at the end of the lane, but I dont really get what the bfd is surrounding Neil Gaiman either. 

I'm not sure if he's catering to a YA crowd or adult crowd. 

Gaiman seems to be great at world building but his characters seemed flat and boring in Ocean at the End of the Lane. And typically if you have all good or all bad characters, I find myself not enjoying those books.

I also suspect if you read a lot, you're going to eventually find there's an author you generally dislike who other people really love.  </TEXT>

I also remember reading a lot of Blake Crouch (Pines). But I didnt want to get into another series so I kind of stopped reading this after the first book. 

A Darker Shade of Magic is on my to-read list and I feel like it might be of a similar vein to what you're looking for. 

Sidenote: I feel like when Silo came out, people were also excited about Ready Player One and Martian. But those have been very much exposed on this subreddit. But, still, if you havent read them, then get on it!  </TEXT>

I really really liked Laura Hillenbrand's style of writing. I loved Unbroken (this Olympian gets stranded at sea for over a month and then ends up in a Japanese POW camp during WWII). And now I want to read Seabiscuit. 

Now I kinda want to check out Lost City of Z

On my to-read list that's simliar is A Spy Among Friends (about a British spy during the Cold War) and Into Thin Air (about an Mt Everest expedition). I'm also very interested in a book called Into the Abyss (about a plane crash where the only survivors are a cop, a prisoner and a mayor - something like that) but it was written by a granddaughter? and so I'm not sure how factual things are. 

Also, read A Short HIstory of Nearly Eveyrthing by Bryson! It's long but the chapters are very digestible.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was spending so much money on amazon because I was buying so many ebooks. So after hearing how you can download ebooks from the library, I was like - eh let me check this out  .... 

I was kind of hesitant bc I didnt want to be mandated to read a book in a 3 week window. And I was also kind of wondering about how to get the books to my kindle (software? yikes). 

But I can turn off my wifi to my Kindle if Im REALLY into a book (and it wont turn it in). And you can use amazon to download the books you check out from the library (so it already works for your kindle!). 

What I also noticed as a benefit is that I increased the quality books I was reading. I was buying all the $1-5 amazon books bc I didnt want to spend like $15 on a Harper Collins release .... but now I can just check whatever new release I want out (for the most part, especially nonfiction!). 

I am also reading paper books again.

I check out audiobooks. 

I downloaded Mango and I'm learning spanish too. 

You can also download magazines - Oprah, Yoga Journal, Rolling Stone, etc.

<TEXT> I stopped reading for pleasure during college. There are times in your life where you have to learn to say "No". And I chose to say no to reading. I was already writing papers and reading chemistry books, etc .... I picked up the habit again later. But I have friends try to fit EVERYTHING in. But you have to say no to some things. It might not be reading ... but there are so many hours in the day. 

I personally like listening to audiobooks during my commutes. And I like to read about 20-30 minutes before I go to bed. And that's usually just stopping my social media browsing earlier </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Tampa, by Alissa Nutting**

This 26-year old attractive female has an unnatural attraction to teenage boys. And of course she chooses to be a teacher. She's very manipulative and sexually aggressive. The book is indeed shocking but, I must say, well-written. I've never read American Psycho buttttt I'd be interested if somenoe has read both of these books and can make some comparisons bc this chick is ... I mean, no words.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I read The Road Less Travelled by Peck and it was a life changing book for me when I read it! The first part, he comes across fairly haughty. But the ideas he put forth in the book are solid! 

I have another book by him about Civility. He talked about how America used to have civics lessons ... what it meant to have respect for your country and he started touching on how it's no longer taught in schools (again, this is a dated book). but I didnt really read beyond that. 

he seems like an interesting guy to say the least!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have some decent books that I own and I dont really feel like selling them for $0.50. I guess I *could* donate them to the library, but I've been hearing about books on the subway with Anna Kendrick and Emma Watson. The problem is ... I dont have a subway around me! I'd like to leave books in a similar manner though ...  

My questions are: 

- Is that considered littering since I'm not a celebrity? 

- If I don't have a subway around me, what places would you recommend to leave a book? 

- Is there a sticker that I could put on the book that's not so specific to subways?  </TEXT>

After I did my workout, I would go to the pullup bar and do 3-5 negatives. And then I would just go for it and try a chinup. 

I'm 5'10", 200# btw. I am not new to fitness though, so I can do pushups and the like .... 

I had some smaller girls at my same gym getting pullups after a few months. But we were doing it after almost ALL our workouts! Patience, consistency and dont burn yourself out where you cant try it again the next day! </TEXT>

<TEXT> In these stories, black women get to be more than just platonic friends and trusted advisers. They are more than just cogs in the wheel to keep the story moving, and they get to sin and come back from it, with rich and complex redemption arcs. They also get to be playful and fun, and flawed. 

Also, shout out to Walking Dead! 

Here's the story the writer gives a shout out to in the article: [Lemonade](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11948791/1/Lemonade) - "a Richonne drama loosely based on the 2016 Beyonc album of the same name" </TEXT>

So a side tip would be to listen to an audiobook if you have trouble falling asleep.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Anyways". 

I really liked Amy Schumer's book but she would talk about something and then transition to another thing by saying "Anyways, ... " 

And sometimes it wasnt even a transition between thoughts! She just threw in an "Anyways, ... " at the start of a sentence that was continuing the thought of the previous sentence before it. 


This other book I'm listening to (Haunting of the Moor, an Irish Ghost Story) does the same thing. Except it's not written by a early 30's blonde female. It's set in the 19th century and I still hear "Anyways ... " in the middle of the Irish folklore. Anyways, it's like literary nails on the chalkboard  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just finished The Vegetarian by Han Kang. And I get the basic plot points of what happened. But I was curious if someone had a good link to a blog that could tie it all together. Particularly the last chapter ... 

- Did In Hye abandon her child? 
- Was it to show that In Hye was almost as damaged as her sister? 
- Was In Hye meant to be symbolized by the bird or am I grasping too much? If so, what does it mean when Heong yi (? I forgot her name) was in the fountain eating the bird? 
- Why did she want to be a tree so much? Was it all "just" a reaction to her abuse as a child? 

I feel like such an idiot right now 

Is there a post or Cliffs Notes about The Vegetarian somewhere? halp.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> IIRC yoga is male dominated in the east. To really even start in the yoga asana, most people have to "master" the breathing and meditation. 

In the west, yoga (in practice) is mainly the postures with very little meditation. I think women being naturally more flexible are more apt to practice yoga than, say, rugby. And men really aren't used to being in "the back of the class" so to speak. 

And it's weird bc there was a time where ppl like shiva rae went back to the east and led classes on the new western style of yoga.

I would hate to see Daryl pull a Carol and do something COMPLETELY badass bc I think that brings the show to the hokey side a little bit and brings me out of the immersion experience of watching a tv show bc things are just a little TOO unreal. Walkers and rotters? Yeah, I believe that. Having someone lose their friends and locked up in a cell for a few days eating dog food and executing a perfect asskicking an episode or two later?

<TEXT> **The Coldest Girl in Coldtown, by: Holly Black, narrated by: Christine Lakin**

This has music in it every now and then, which is odd. But not completely offputting. 

I really like the narrator. She reminds me of Nina Dobrev's voice. 

And this is some type of YA vampire book. Tana is the main character and she meets up with a seemingly powerful vampire, her boyfriend that might be changing into a vampire, and 2 "edgy" bloggers who really want to be vampires. They are heading to this place that's like the Las Vegas for vampires and vampire-lovers called Coldtown. But once you go in, it's very difficult to legally leave. 

It's fun.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Vampires in the Lemon Grove, by Karen Russell**

Short stories by the woman who wrote Swamplandia. The first story was about vampires who quench their bloodlust by biting lemons. This is my book.

**The Vegetarian, by Han Kang**

I just finished the first portion. A woman becomes vegetarian and it *really* frustrates her husband. Now I'm into the 2nd portion and we've moved onto her brother in law who works for a k-pop group and he's got a great idea for a new art project. Reading this one on my iPhone which is a completely different reading experience! I feel like I'm always trying to look around the corner bc the "page flips" are so short. 

**Coldest Girl in Coldtown, by by Holly Black**

A teenager thinks she's been infected by vampirism. It's a fun ride so far. Im listening to it on audiobook from the library.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **The Vegetarian, by Han Kang**

My library had this one as an ebook. My Kindle is missing at the moment so I'm reading it off my iPhone bc it's a fairly short book it seems. Reading off a phone is different bc the page turns are so short! I'm already swiping and I've yet to read the last line or so from the previous screen. But I finished The Vegetarian and am starting Mongolian Mark so I'm about a third of the way through. 

**Thirteen Reasons Why, by Jay Asher**

Finished this on audiobook. I'm on the fence about this one. I dont think it accurately portrays suicide among teens. Clay, the main kid, is unrealistically nice. And I got annoyed that Clay would stop the tapes all the time and interrupt Hannah (this was probably because I was on audiobook since there were two narrators). But it seemed like he'd be like "I stopped the tapes. I remember Billy Bob walking down the halls. I start the tape. [Hannah resumes talking]" COOL STORY CLAY TELL ME MORE

**Coldest Girl in Coldtown, by Holly Black**

I just downloaded this. Audiobook. So I have no clue yet but let me know if you've read it and what you thought! </TEXT>

I feel like 3 stars dont really say anything. 5 stars are either too long, the reviewer got the book for free, and/or they don't really say anything. And 1 stars are the type of reviewers (like on amazon) where a person complains about a product for something completely unrelated - i.e. "UPS never delivered the package!"  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just finished Thirteen Reasons Why on audiobook. I have a few issues with the book but i dont regret reading it. I dont think it accurately portrays suicide in teens and I think the main character is a little bit too good to be true - so it pulls me out of the story. plus, he's always interrupting the flow of the tapes to be like "I stop the tape. I remember seeing billy bob in the hall one time. I start the tape." But again, I was on audiobook, so they had to switch narrators every time he stopped the tape and interrupted the Hannah narrator.  </TEXT>

It seems so silly to discount 90% of a book based on an ending. i thought the ending was fine anyways. I hate when books put out a big mystery and don't tell you what happened. But this book did that. I would definitely check this movie out if it happens!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Spoilers] Chandler Riggs - is he the actor we want moving forward? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-26 19:52:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> How do you feel about Chandler Riggs? I feel like with the younger actors, we don't really know how they'll flesh out (heh) as an older actor. When you're an adult, you're pretty stable in your abilities. But Chandler started the show so young. And it seems as if the show is just stuck with him. 

Do you think Chandler Riggs can handle the weight of his role? Does he pull you out of the immersive experience of watching a tv show? Do you like what we have? Or would you be okay with an actor switch to push the acting abilities to another level for the Carl character?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have access to a regular gym, so I have been going there and doing leg curls, back extensions and a low row machine they have. And I generally find I dont wake up with a sore tight back in the morning. 

When they have KBS in the workout, I basically follow similar logic. If it's a high rep swing (like 100+), I will go light and/or reduce the reps (our gym has a novice version of workouts with less reps typically). I would have times during the swings where it felt like just my back was gassed. Very weak and tired feeling. 

Ive gone light with no issue, so I wanted to start going up again since I've been working on my posterior with the strength training and I havent felt any tiredness in my back with KBS recently. 

One chiro told me I was quad dominant (and he was like, it's the curse of the crossfitter, keeps him in business, yada yada). And my current guy has given me workouts with bands to strengthen certain parts of my core. Initially, I feel like the posterior work has been helping a lot with tightness in my back in the morning, and I don't know why. So I'm continuing to do the posterior work even though the new guy isnt really telling me to do so. It cant hurt, right? 

So when my gym programs squats, I might do good mornings or hip thrusts. When they do deadlifts, I'll do RDLs. I'll do hip thrusts ... And then I'll go to the other gym for the back ext and leg curls (I'm already there teaching a group fitness class anyways and it takes like 15 minutes). 

edit: And I have been focusing on squeezing the right stuff when I do swings. I think that's the whole point of the posterior work ... to maybe turn those "on" so I'm not so reliant on my quads doing cleans, snatches, squats, et?  </TEXT>

I had an L4/L5 herniation (and foot drop associated with it). I have always gotten tight in my back from KBS (or gym programs them frequently). How do you view this? Do you go lighter or stop doing the movement when you feel the tightness?  </TEXT>

This is a YA novel. A boy receives some cassette tapes in the mail. He starts listening to them and finds out they originate from a classmate who committed suicide. If you receive the tapes, you were one of the reasons why she committed suicide. 

It's a library book. I'm not wow'ed by the book so I'm glad I didn't pay for it! But I'm also not the target demographic either. And I'm about 50% of the way through.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> FUN AND NOT SERIOUS RECOMMEND: If you like thrillers, I like You by Caroline Kepnes. It's fresh and fun. This stalker guy works at a bookstore and finds his next "target". It's told from his viewpoint and he's an acidic, but kind of intelligent, guy. And then towards the end you're like ... why do I kind of like this stalker guy? bc he tends to have more personality than the girls that he's after ... 

Movies that are from books might be fun bc you can do dinner and a movie afterwards - Gone Girl, Girl on the Train ... 

I'm sure other people have serious recommendations. I just think a fun book is easier to get most of your group to read it! 

But you can also search for books that have questions to go along with the book. I feel like a lot of Jodi Picoult books have questions at the end to start discussions for book clubs. 

edit: Also Big Little Lies by Lianne Moriarty! Reese Witherspoon is starting an HBO miniseries based on the book.

<TEXT> **Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo, by Amy Schumer**

This one came available from my library, so I put down what I was currently reading and started this one. I think it's funny and if you like Mindy Kaling, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, why would you not like this? The person that had this book before me was eating chocolate (I hope) bc there are brown smudges on the first few chapters. But I don't think they finished the book bc I haven't come across another smudge since the third chapter. Amy dissects her journal entries, talks about her dad (he has MS, which means he shit his pants a few times), and reminisced about her earlier shoplifting experiences. I've laughed out loud a few times. 

**Before the Fall, by Noah Hawley**

Just finished this one. Great writing and well-paced. Super well-paced, I don't think I ever got bored reading it. If endings can piss you off, I'd stay away. But I loved the journey. Book Set-up: Private jet crashes, only survivors are a painter and a 4-year old boy/heir to bazillions of dollars.

<TEXT> I just updated a fic I havent updated in over a year! I feel so bad for my readers. 

But it's a walking dead rick/beth fic. And I'm GOING to finish it. 

So this chapter was Rick teaching Beth how to fight zombies. It was titled "Two Rules" and he teaches her to Run and Hide. And then he's going to take her back to Glenn and Maggie. 

But then the NEXT chapter, they're going to run across a zombie and he's going to go ahead and teach her the third rule, which is FIGHT. And she's going to be capable in killing a zombie. And THEN they're going to go back to eat with Glenn and Maggie and go to sleep. This is the calm before the storm. I'm going to have to convincingly separate Beth and Rick from Maggie and Glenn so their story can continue. 

The show airs on the 23rd so I should really try to put something out there by Friday. But I dont know if I can put something "quality" out by then.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not a fan of series so much anymore. 

I don't like when the first book of three ends on a cliffhanger. I thought I was getting a complete story, not a part 1! That's how I felt about kingkiller chronicles. I just felt like I didnt get a complete story.  

With standalones, I can get a beginning, middle and end 3 times over or I can read a long epic where the writer might not be that great. I like to start what I finish, so if I read book 2 of 3, I almost feel obligated to read the last one! So when I pick up a 3-parter, I think long and hard if I want this to be my book experience for the next months. 

edit: on the flipside, a lot of these series are more likely to become the next GoT or tv show, so I start to eye them when I hear that pop buzz surrounding them. I dont know if that makes me shallow but whateverrrrr </TEXT>

<TEXT> Audiobooks are a great option! 

I go through the library a lot and use overdrive. The app is horrible but the books are free. 

I also have an audible account. I started on the two books a month plan to build my library. But now I'm on the every other month plan bc I have such a backlog of audiobooks. Try it out free first! Audible has a very good customer service. 

If you use the library, I have a difficult time getting through anything over 11, 12 hours with my 20 minute commute. So I wouldnt get a 33 hour book on your first go! 

Check out r/audiobooks and r/audible for suggestions and the like. There are some books where the audio-version really complements the storytelling!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you were 6 books into this goal, that's one thing. But you're almost to the end, finish it out! There are physically challenging things (like marathons, I guess) that probably suck too right at the end. BUt I think this is a goal you definitely have within reach and it seems you're still on pace!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Adam Carolla said, when he was working on his audiobook, that he tried to get it at least 8 hours. That seems to be the length where people still feel like they're getting a book, but they're not committing like 20+ hours of their life to something they might not like. 

I listen in 15-30 minute spurts during my commute. Sometimes I have to speed up the narrator if they're a little sluggish ... But I add about 5 -8 books to my read pile from audiobooks. 

And fuck yeah I read that shit if I listened to it.  </TEXT>

I also subscribe to r/fanfiction and I'm about to post a chapter on a work that I havent updated in a year. I have a tendency to not complete things, so I think it's a personal goal of mine to see this story through! And reading everyone's comments about posting, getting reviews and feedback inspires me to dust that work off and complete it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really loved Edward Hermann's narration of Unbroken by Laura Hillenbrand. I felt like I was listening to it live on the radio. 

I recently listened to Swamplandia and SO MANY people hated the narrator who represented Ava. She just sounded so dissociated and bored by the story she was telling. 

I'm currently listening to Klostermann's But What if We're Wrong. And I'd much rather listen to him narrate his own book. But it's this British chick and she's very distracting. 

When the narrator benefits the book, it's wonderful! I really like comedians narrating their own book (like Amy Poehler, Mindy Kaling, Aziz, etc). The audiobook becomes a different experience.

<TEXT> Wasn't a huge fan of the book. I was hoping the movie would be better than the book. (I'm also a huge fan of Eva Green!)

SPOILERS: 

The book starts off great but there's something off about it. I'm trying to figure out what it is exactly, but maybe the book is very adjective heavy or over descriptive when it didnt need to be. And I found myself getting bored while reading the book.  

In the book, the main girl Emma has power over fire. So they changed that for the movie. Plus, Emma really dug the main character's grandfather. But she doesnt age. So they didnt want it to be weird that she's the love interest of the grandfather (when he was younger) and the main guy at the current stage of the story.  I have heard the movie played down Emma and the grandfather's relationship they had in the book.  </TEXT>

Even with romance novels, the key ingredient of a blockbuster book isnt hanky-panky but what the authors call human closeness: the everyday meaningful interactions between human beings that make up a good chunk of every best-seller in every genre.

<TEXT> **But What if We're Wrong, by Chuck Klosterman, narrated by  Fiona Hardingham**

I loved the other Chuck Klosterman books I've read, but this one is miserable to get through on audiobook. Chuck read the opening and everything was great. Then this chick took over and I dont know if it's her or what, but I feel like she's not delivering the already complicated concepts he's putting out there in an understandable way. Maybe her cadence is off, I dont know. But I hardly know what's happening. There is a lot of "mabye this is true, but maybe the opposite is true" and I have no clue what the book is trying to focus on. Not sure if it's the audiobook format or Klosterman's actual writing. Very frustrating. 

**Before the Fall, by Noah Hawley**

This book is really good so far! A private plane goes down in the water and the only people who come out alive are a painter and the 4 year old kid of some mega-rich, media mogul. This book deals with the post-crash pieces that have to get picked up by the painter (ie. how to handle the "fame", what actually happened? why did he live?). I've heard people are disappointed by the ending. But I'm really digging the book so far. The writer wrote for Bones and Fargo (the tv series).

<TEXT> I dont have any suggestions but I herniated an L4 disc in the beginning of Jan. And I just walked and stayed out of the gym. I had a drop foot (like my nerve was messed up and I couldnt flex my foot!). It was very traumatic, not gonna lie. (I also gained like 20 lbs so dont do that!). 

But now might not be a great time to focus on yoga, Maybe it's a time or a "season" to foster other habits. Maybe read more, maybe work on culinary skills, etc. 

Ask the doctors what you *can* do. Maybe they want you to strengthen your core? Maybe you walk. Maybe you swim. I took a restorative yoga class a few times. 

It sucked for me, bc I had a lot of social life going on at the gym. Plus I teach yoga ... and I had to teach by cueing only (which I can do, thank god) and the people I work for were really nice about it and so were the regulars. 

Don't force the issue in a yoga class. I know not all instructors are doctors and they can't know all the nuances of injury.  Forward folds happen with so many poses. Even transitioning from standing to plank is a forward fold. I dont know how you could omit forward folding in most hatha or power yoga classes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I teach at a university. And it's, more often than not, one of the student's first introductions to yoga, so I keep all that stuff light. I focus on them being physically still and just "seeing what happens" when they close their eyes in savasana. I'll close with namaste and say what it means. I'll give them a little bit of guidance, but I try not to talk too much or get into chakras, meditation, etc. I dont om or chant in sanskrit. I mainly call the poses by their american version and then throw in the sanskrit name every now and then. 

But sometimes in tree, I might say something like "where do you need balance in your life?" Or I'll say something generically that might come across as "deep". My focus in teaching beginners is: getting them to engage muscles they'd otherwise ignore, teaching them how to be still, encouraging body awareness, breathing deeper than just the space of their ribs, and just relaxing and stretching them out. I'm fixing planks and having people watch their ego and come out of upward facing dog and hold cobras ... 

I think it really depends on your knowledge and where you teach. If you're teaching more of a fitness class, I'd stay away from getting too deep into the spiritual aspect of it. A guy in my class came up and said the namaste part made him uncomfortable. I've never seen him again! It was just one guy, and I'm glad it's not a trend with the class I teach! 

I know I'm not a "studio" instructor. I really do love teaching beginners. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just scrolled to this comment, but definitely agree. 

For me, I had a pretty good front squat and weak back squat. I herniated my L4. A few people (2 chiros and my neurosurgeon) say that it's probably due to strong anterior and weak posterior. So Im lowering my weights and working on my posterior to decrease the chance of it happening again. :/ 

edit: i was told by one of the chiros the strong anterior, weak posterior/"quad dominant" is classic crossfitter and helps keep him in business.  </TEXT>

If you have sore back a lot, you might want to work on strengthening your posterior a bit.

<TEXT> How big is your social circle? I go to a gym and I have found some people who like to read. We've started chatting and I threw out the idea of a book club. It still has yet to happen though ... 

Spark up a conversation with people you already know and you might be surprised. You can also post on reddit (like your city subreddit) and see if there are any local book clubs or neat bookstores in the area.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had to take an Uber home yesterday bc of drinking things. Someone had given me a bag (for me to puke in). And so the car moves and I am like - oh god i feel horrible. And so I puke in the bag. But the bag had no bottom! And so I puke in this guys car. And I wake up to a $75 cleaning fee in addition to my $23 Uber. 

Who gives someone a bag to puke in with no bottom?! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Night Film by Marisha Pessl isnt very prose-y but I did like the idea of the novel. A secretive, director's beautiful daughter commits suicide and a disgraced journalist looks into the whole matter. Loved it! 

I've heard good things about Broken Monsters by Lauren Beukes but I have yet to read it. Kept getting compared to True Detective Season 1 so that's why I have it on my to-read list still.

I also wonder how many coaches out there have liability insurance. Sometimes the waiver really only protects the gym, not the individual coaches. And we're in a litigious society so .... if I was a coach at a crossfit gym, I'd read the waiver and see if youre protected against a lawsuit.

<TEXT> I havent updated my fic coming up on a year now. I have an outline. I know how the story will mostly end. I just stopped writing bc of exercise, work, and teaching yoga. So I had to basically re-read my work. I feel like such an ass because the 70 or so followers are going to get some email about my story being updated. And it's going to be a crap chapter. 

But after reading the work, I found the old file that had the chapter. I had to rewrite it and edit a lot out because it was just filler and not going anywhere. I pushed up an "exciting" scene just to make the chapter worth it to the readers. And now I think I need about two more days of editing it and filling it with more content (its only about 2k words :/ but I write shorter chapters and the length is honestly in line with what i've already posted). The tv show is about to start, so I should get to posting and get pre-premier view bump. 

This chapter is all buildup still. I feel like once my story climaxes, the end will come shortly after. The story focuses on a small ship in a big fandom. And it's a slow burn that fizzles. But I want it to fit in with the canon and make sense. Like it *could* have happened on the show. And I'm not sure if I should just add some more sexiness or keep it more in line to what the characters would actually do when put in a perilous situation? I'm leaning towards the latter. 

Obviously I needed to get this off my chest! I'm glad I FINALLY started focusing on my fanfic again. I just need to write more bc I'm so rusty.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do yoga, so I definitely see a lot of you guys! 

All I can say is because your body has more options to get into, you have a higher chance of getting into an injurious position. And most people dont have the option to get into positions that might cause harm because their joints just dont move that way or they're so inflexible or muscle-bound, they don't have full ROM in the first place. 

A lot of the cues we give are "dont lock your knee/elbow" or "slight bend in the knee/elbow" ... but that really only helps so far. Especially when you have heavy weights overhead you're trying to "lock out".

I'm always curious of writers' writing processes. Do you have any daily routines that you do when you're writing? I work 9-5 so my day is pretty laid out. I'm wondering if you have a specific location you go to to write, do you turn off social media, do you listen to music, do you aim to write so and so many words a day? etc. 
Thank you!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have two pretty substantial stories in mind. 

1. The Walking Dead - it's the dreaded one where Rick wakes up and "it was all just a dream". So he's walking around with a huge mistrust of Shane. He sees Shane whispering with his wife (but like nothing has happened between them). And Rick is just edgy, but then life starts to go on. Then one day, he pulls over Maggie for speeding. Then he goes and finds Daryl ... Daryl is like WHO R U. Rick is flipping his shit and people are like - you need to chill. Then he settles down again. Third part is when he actually sees a walker. That basically starts the conclusion. And I cant spoil the ending. 

2. The Vampire Diaries - this is actually an original fic I want to write but I'm doing an AU, I guess, to put out the story. Caroline and Elena (or Bonnie I havent decided yet) are not vampires or witches. But they go on a retreat, no cellphones, no internet, no wifi. Turns out this retreat is REAL rugged. They go on hikes, sweat lodges, meditation things, etc. Then the girls find out they can't escape and theyre trapped! I gotta plot this one out a bit ....  </TEXT>

I have seen comments that are like "omg wouldnt that be so cool if .... ?" and I'm thinking Thats TOTALLY not what is going to happen. And I know that's in no way what you're going through ... but even that innocuous suggestion started to sway me and my resolve on my plot a little bit! 

I always think that you - the writer - KNOW the bigger picture. And if all things come to a good conclusion (and that doesnt necessarily mean a happy ending) and the story mechanics work out, I call that a success. And you're doing this for you, so continue on. And if you're crossing into bad taste? I think that's something you would only know because you know where the story is going.  </TEXT>

Just started this one so I'm not sure on the thematic direction of the book. however, I like the concept considering the time period we're currently  in - of blog posts and misinformation that quickly spreads around. This book will probably be "bigger picture". Anyways, I really enjoyed another Klosterman book I read (think it was sex drugs and cocoa puffs?) so I'm excited I'm already enjoying this one as well.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They each have their pros!

Audiobooks - great while commuting, but they can put me to sleep if I'm at my house. they can also add more personality to the book with a good narrator. audiobooks read by the author are really special. 

ebooks - my preferred reading at night (which is when I do most of my reading) bc i don't have to mess with any lights and the e-ink is easy on my eyes in a dark room. I can also take a hundred books around in my purse. 

I don't have to go anywhere for my ebooks  or audiobooks. I can just download them 

print - I mainly consume my library books this way! The library has got me back into reading paper books again.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sometimes I forget how much the tv shows "lock in" the imagery of a book for me. Once you see Maisie Williams as Arya, that is what Arya looks like. The Iron Throne looks like the tv show version (and what ends up on top of people's cakes, etc) ... the one in the link looks a lot grander than what we see! 

I remember another article talking about the scale of the Game of Thrones dragons, and I thought that was fun too. 

edit: From the article

Oh, no. Thats totally not right; thats sort of what HBO did, Groell recalled Martin saying of an early effort by Tammy Patterson. Mine is much bigger and more tangled. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agreed! This is over-generalizing, but my ff.net reviewers tend to be: younger, foreigners (or English is not their first language. I have one girl who straight up comments in Portuguese). And the ao3 people tend to write more in depth, "deeper" reviews (so I assume they're older) but they seem less "fangirl"ish. 

I write m/f pairings (but that's usually a side story, I have other stuff going on). They seem to have a better reception on ff.net. I also don't write smut. And I seem to hear a lot of slash writers do very well on ao3 on this subreddit. But meanwhile I'm just not seeing the same feedback from ao3 (if I get reviews in the first place on ao3). I have maybe 1500 views on ao3 and then like 17k on ff.net for the same story. :/ 

edit:  I have some one-shots that did okay on ao3 compared to ff.net. But it's definitely for a smaller fandom, so I assume it's just fandom related.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, fun read! 

 Earlier this year, there was a round of excited editorials about how print is back, baby after industry reports showed print sales increasing for the second consecutive year. However, the growth was driven almost entirely by non-fiction sales more specifically adult coloring books and YouTube celebrity memoirs. As great as adult coloring books may be, their sales figures tell us nothing about the sales of, say, literary fiction.

I had no clue print sales were increasing ... and I had no clue it was because of coloring books. But I can't say I'm surprised! Out of my circle of friends, I know 3 that have bought their first book in years ... annnnnd it was a coloring book.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World, by Andrea Wulf**

Just started this one. Only about two chapters in. But apparently this guy was a friend of Goethe's and an inspiration to Darwin. He pioneered the concept of the "interconnectedness" of nature. Written in laymen's terms so far. I like that bc I don't get overwhelmed! She's good about explaining the prevalent thought at the time, so I really get an understanding of the impact of the Humboldt's concepts.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I dont really read a book for the ending. I read it for the journey it takes me on. So when a book ends with the main character dying or living or getting the girl or not getting the girl ... the way the author chooses to end the book (for the most part) will not affect the way I feel about the whole book. 

I hear people go, "I liked the book and then I got to the ending, and I HATED the ending, therefore I hate the book ...." If you enjoyed the book until the end, does that invalidate the remainder of the book? 

I think I would have enjoyed Rosie Project whether or not he got the girl. I was already invested with the characters by the end, ya know?  </TEXT>

When you're in the actual process of writing, do you have a pretty specific ritual? I work 9-5 at an office, so I know where I'll be and my day is pretty structured. I am always curious how artists and writers manage their time! Do you do social media at a certain time? Do you turn off the internet so you're not distracted? Do you write so and so many words a day or just stop when you feel like it? Do you always have music or coffee at your work station?? 

Thanks for doing this AMA

<TEXT> 3!

1. Audiobook for my commute (currently: Swamplandia)
2. Longer, serious read - this is a book that I read to better myself but it's typically not the first I would grab from a pile. classic, nonfiction, critically received book, etc. (Currently: Invention of Nature - a book about Alexander Humboldt)
3. Fluff piece or whatever else I have from the library. Best sellers, typically.  (Currently: Fates and Furies - library)

And I know a guy who works in comic books so whatever he decides to get me! Is that like half a book? Paper Girls, Swamp Thing, The Alcoholic, The Crow .... If you can, you should know a comic book guy! 

edit: And I like having the option of 2 books to read when I'm not going the audiobook route. Typically they're different enough that I have a preference for one or the other. I dont have problems picking books back up after not having reading them for a week.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So my fandom's show is premiering soon. I havent updated this goddamn fic in over a year. But I see the views spiking (bc its Walking Dead, a big fandom). 

2 days ago: I did a BIG edit and got the idea of my next chapter. 

Last night: I filled in the holes

today and probably another day: I'll need to make it presentable ... I still have a huge chunk of something missing so I'll need to write more or edit something out. 


BIG BREATH. 

Its such a fucking dumb filler chapter but I can see cute stuff in there that people will want to read. And I love where the story is going and how it's all going to tie together, so I gotta do this.  And the other part of me would like to get back into updating this work frequently bc the show is starting again and the timing is right ...  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If it's something like that ... I typically will put what episode I started writing the fic in the summary. This helps put things into context for most people. I was writing a Walking Dead and they killed off my character. So in the summary, I have that the events of my fic took place before so and so season. 

I'd also like to mention that if a show goes in a different direction than what most reasonable people would expect, fans of the show got hooked on the show (or series or whatever) before the "big change". So I would not change the direction of the original fic personally. Maybe you have a nostalgic fandom ... pining for the world before the writers of the show derailed the universe.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got reamed for it in the sub awhile back, but this is why I don't read other fics in my current WIP's fandom. Because I will either copy what's already out there (bc I'll be like ... well my fic isnt like these fics AT ALL and I start getting nervous - insert raven simone chewing gum gif) or I'll think it's not up to par or I'll see they have more comments and followers and I get wrapped up in things that really have zero effect on my story. So I think it's best just to be me going into my WIPs. 

edit: and the person who "reamed" me was actually really respectful! And I realize that my original comment came across like fanfic writers arent very good and I would rather read "real" books.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>   I like that ROMWOD can be done with (almost) zero equipment and (personally) wouldn't keep up with a program that required much

That's really the nice thing about romwod! I feel like I'm more likely to do it at my house. I just need a little bit of floor space and maybe a towel and I'm g2g. 

You're not supposed to do it right after a workout, so I'm less likely to be at a gym where I'd have time to do the romwod (and the open space and mats at my gym are more conducive to handstands etc). So I like to do it around lunch time or in the morning. If I have shorts, I'll change into them at work and do the romwod in my office (door shut, obv).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a yogi friend (female) that diligently stretched about 4-5 days a week and got into splits in 2-3 months (right leg, not the left one). After she "got it", she stopped doing the stretches and lost it quickly after! She was like 28 at the time. 

I know a guy that can just get into them and I don't know of him actively working on this stretch ever. Past martial artist, he's in his 40s. 

Everyone else I know just shows off in a "look what I can do" way but I don't know anyone currently working towards this goal. 

Romwod will not get you into splits. You can look at stretches for splits on youtube and practice a few times a week if that's your goal.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I teach yoga. And I do the romwods. You wont be able to get into the splits, but romwod (as I see the workouts now) could help definitely help out most people's hamstrings and ankle ROM quite a bit.  

I personally think he overemphasizes the back part of the body. It'd be nice to have more poses to open the front of the body. Even work on the wrists and such, maybe some twists ... But that's just me.  I wouldnt want to see handstands and the show-off yoga poses bc then it's skill work and you're not really working on your ROM so much anymore. 

RANT: My BIGGEST gripe is that he has blocks and everything there, but the 2 or 3 people doing the pose are all doing the same thing. I tweeted at the romwod people (and they're good with social media and responsive) but I got back a "We're working on it".  I just don't understand why they can't SHOW all levels of the pose! Especially if he's already verbalizing it. There's got to be some musclebound dudes that cant sit on their heels all that easily. And I just know from teaching yoga that if you say people can do a modification but they don't visually see the modification, then no one will do the modification. "Use a block". I have never seen anyone use the block. What does that mean? You have the block there, and no one is using it. It's a prop at this point. And I'm sure more people would buy the fucking "romwod(TM) block" if someone actually touched it during the romwod. 

That's obv a pet peeve of mine! Rant over. 

At the end of the day, it's what? $13 a month? Less than what I spend on coffee a week. I don't think it's bad for a daily chill yoga practice. The little stretches do add up. 

From my personal experience with yoga, I know a 50 year old woman just wanted to be able to hug her knees into her chest (she couldnt do that) and after a year of yoga, she pulled me aside and showed me that she could finally hug her knees into her chest. It was a very powerful moment to her. 

Whether or not ROMWOD will show you "gainz" in your flexibility or not really depends on your current flexibility. If you try it out, I'd  suggest doing it no less than 3x a week. I do romwod and yoga and it just really helps me with my back. I tend to wake up with a stiff back.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love chilling and watching tv. But I also know that exercise is good for me. So I have a lot of times where I would rather watch tv than exercise. But I know tv will be there later and "now" is the time that I traditionally exercise. So I work out and watch tv with whatever leftover time I have at night. 

And that's the same with writing. I personally have to divvy out time to write. I know that internent, tv, food, will all be there later. But if I don't plan a time to write, then I won't do it! 

I know that the payoff for writing fanfic + 1.5 hours of tv is better than watching 3 hours of tv. There's just a greater sense of accomplishment with fanfic than what I'd be doing otherwise with my time!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had to stop reading those $2.99 books with high ratings on amazon. What I found out was they were part of a series. So the book would end with one part of the story ended but leave a big question open or, even worse, just a flat-out cliffhanger. And then the 2nd book would be like $9.99 or normal-ish price. 

So I definitely try to stay away from series. I'm not really trying to get into Outlander. But I'm not completely opposted. I'd read Deborah Harkness books or I'd try out that Annihilation series. It really depends on the story. 

But with most series I want to read - most of the books seem to be: 

- on a quick schedule to be released (like Miss Peregrine, Harry Potter ... but not GoT or Name of the Wind - which I read NotW)
- they've been heavily vetted by blogs and /r/books (like the Annihilation series). 

- or the description just really piques my interest (like the All Souls trilogy, WITCHES!) </TEXT>

I found myself cringing during the awkward writings or would notice the "instant chemistry" that would literally never happen (like Anastasia Steele tripping and billionaire Christian thinking it was SO hot .... or when Bella was just so average but Edward Cullen was obsessed with her anyways). But I read the books SO fast and I still enjoyed them.

And it's just like candy or dessert. It's okay to have it every now and then, right?!

<TEXT> This is one difference I notice with reading on an ereader ... 

I read Tom's River on my Kindle. And I was like damn this is taking forever. I walked by the actual book in a Barnes and Noble and actually saw how thick it was and I recall thinking to myself "Wow, I would have kept pushing this book off for 'later' because of how thick it is." 

I look at long books like a long run. Just one foot in front of the other. Don't think about reading the whole thing while picking it up. Just read the first chapter. Read a few pages every night. And eventually you'll be halfway done! 

What's that saying? What's the best time to plant a tree? 10 years ago. When is the second best time? Today.

<TEXT> As a general rule, I do not. 

I find when I read books, the experience and visuals of the book are still fairly amorphous (plot aside). But once I SEE a movie (with the actors and settings, etc), those things get locked in. And then I find it really takes away from my book reading experience! So I try to read the books before I watch the movies. Especially with thrillers. 

I would not have read A Walk Among the Tombstones (by Lawrence Block) if I saw the movie first. But Oh man ... the book was great! You got a great NYC vibe, with the accents and things (reading the book, that is). But when I saw the movie, I didnt really notice the "hustle" of NYC, the differences of cultures, the burroughs, the subway ... and I wasnt picturing Liam neeson as Scudder. The movie lost the New Yorkness of the book!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Great NPR interview with Jason Blum. Talks about the state of horror, why low budget horror is doing so well, and the three things that affect movie budget </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-31 17:31:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was listening to NPR last night and there was a great interview with Jason Blum of Blumhouse Productions (think Sinister, Purge, Insidious). He put a lot of things into perspective about the state of horror movies at the moment.  [Here is the NPR Link of the transcript](http://www.npr.org/2016/08/30/491984305/with-a-little-magic-small-budget-horror-films-pack-a-big-punch). And here are some excerpts from the interview.

Why low budget works for horror in the first place.

Scary movies benefit from lower budgets. And that's because the scariest things are things that seem the most real. And when you take out all the bells and whistles in production you really have to focus on, you know, small stories that take place in a house. And that's, I think, where people usually feel most vulnerable, in their house. And the room in their house they feel most vulnerable is their bedroom. And if you don't have a lot of money, you kind of have to force - it forces the director to tell these very intimate stories, which I think are much scarier than big effects extravaganzas.

Jason Blum also talks about the THREE things that affect budget

But I think there's kind of a triangle, three things that affect budget - the number of characters, the number of locations and the number of stunts and special effects. And I tell the directors they can kind of choose one of those three things. They can either have a lot of speaking parts, you know, a handful of locations or we can do a stunt or two, but only one of the three.

And if you actually went back and kind of looked at our movies, you'd kind of see that play out. I actually believe, though, that when you really forced parameters from the beginning, it leads to interesting things. And I can't say, you know, the movies are always - always benefit from it, but more often than not I feel like the movies benefit from the lower budgets which push directors to make unusual choices.

He continues, contrasting horror movies with other genres. 

Well, I don't - I actually don't agree with that. I think when you go to see a romantic comedy, I think a couple things are different. First of all, you want a movie star in a romantic comedy. A horror movie is almost better with someone who you don't see every day in magazines because it's kind of scarier. You don't know them, and you can put yourself in their position more easily. I think when you go see a romantic comedy, you want big, big stars that you know well and you want to see them fall in love. And I think that, first of all, right there, it's more expensive.

When you go see an action movie, you want a great action sequence. And that costs money. So it's easy for me to say, you know, I keep my budgets low, but I have a big advantage because I think horror benefits from that. And I don't really - I think most other genres, you actually do need a lot of money to deliver what the audience wants.

Are the big studios going to get in on the action? 

Two or three years ago, everyone used to ask me, are you worried about people copying your model? And I used to say no, I don't worry about it. It seems no one's doing it. If you ask me that now I would say I'm certainly concerned about it a little bit more, for sure. I think studios are - they're - you know, they're oil tankers. They're slow to react, but I do think they're beginning to react now. And it'll be interesting to see what happens in the next year or two. And I bet there'll be a lot of great scary movies, which I'm certainly looking forward to seeing and hope some of them I will have made. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a contrast, I felt like [REC] made me feel confined and I always was trying to "look around the corner" bc of the camera shots. 

I typically don't like shaky camera, documentary style things ... but this worked for me in creating the atmosphere. 

I loved It Follows. Also set in Detroit. I felt it was very dreamy. For some reason I loved [that shot of her in the pool](https://thoughtcatalog.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/8ca0fd9e-e409-4f69-a7f2-d902e94d077a.jpg). I dont know why I think about it. 

That first long shot in Don't Breathe was amazing. It focused on the locks and you felt your eyes lingering on things as the camera slowed down. Fantastic long shot!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I read some thriller/horrors over this summer!

THE TROOP by Nick Cutter - a group of boy scouts and their scoutmaster go on a camping trip to a secluded island when a stranger walks upon their campsite. It has a lot of body horror if you're into that type of thing. And the kids have different personalities so they're easy to tell apart. 

HIDDEN BODIES by Caroline Kepnes - Joe, the passive aggressive stalker/killer we all grew to love in YOU, is back! And he's in LA this go round. More of the same as YOU, but even more incredulous at times. But it's a good thriller with a sense of humor.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My current gym programs on cycles. So we'll see the lifts repeatedly so we actually have a chance to get better at them! 

I definitely understand where you're coming from though. It took me over a year to get the difference between a snatch, a power snatch a hang snatch and then a hang power snatch ... THEN I wouldnt know what weight to even start off with. And the class would move so fast sometimes ... I would always have a moment of panic when I chose the weights for the conditioning. Hopefully I had chosen wisely. 

It was very frustrating. So I was able to make things A LITTLE better by taking better notes in my notebook ... I'd record the weights and then a smiley face or a frowny face (or something in between). That way, when the movement came up again, I'd know if I should hold at that weight or go heavier/lighter.  

And before class, I would start watching youtubes of the movement just so I would know wtf I'd be doing when I got to the gym. 

Later, I took about half a year of olympic lifting with a barbell club and that made ALL the difference. If you know how to snatch and clean and jerk, the other movements are intuitive or you're just more familiar with them. 

Sometimes Crossfit programming isnt direct and focused, so it leads to experiences like this with new people.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I read Eat Pray Love and didnt like that either. I ended up liking it better than Wild bc I felt Gilbert actually emotionally and mentally changed on her journey. Strayed, I felt, was the same selfish person coming out of the PCT as she went into it.  I also think that Gilbert was a much better writer. I think Gilbert has other quality books in her ... but I doubt Strayed has other good books in her. 

But after reading EPL and then Wild ... I stayed away from the "girls finding themselves on a solitary journey" genre for a bit! I did read Walk in the Woods by Bill Bryson and loved that! 

Thanks for the book rec. I put it on my ever growing list of to read pile.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Basically an ill-prepared woman hikes portions of the PCT. She did heroin and cheated on her husband but we're supposed to feel bad for her bc her mom dies and she had a difficult time coping. 

Spoilers: We have to hear about her bruising from carrying a frame backpack. She won't stfu about it. Like we get it. You are not built for hiking. She also loses one of her shoes (that didn't fit in the first place) on the trail. I think it fell off the mountain. How does that even happen?! And then she gets mad at REI for the replacement shoes taking a few days to get to her remote location (she paid $0 for the replacement ones; some REI rep gets bitched at when Cheryl calls them crying about her free shoes not getting there overnight). Whenever she came across money, she'd spend it on something dumb and then we'd hear her complain how unfair it was that she didn't have money. I think she even left stamps as a tip for a waitress. STAMPS. And she was like addicted to fucking guys, so while she was hiking, she fucks a stranger to create new habits I guess. And then she is done hiking the trail and stops by an ice cream place and laments that no one is buying her a fucking ice cream. 

God it's been so long since I read this book, I'm sure I'm messing it up. I'm also on mobile so lord knows how this post reads. But the author wrote this "memoir" like 10 years after her hike so who knows what liberties she took with her retelling.

And for some god damn reason it became an Oprah book club selection and a movie.

I cannot begin to describe how insufferable I found the author while reading this "memoir". 

And her last name isn't even Strayed. She changed it bc 2edgy4me fuck if i know

edit: and she KNEW she had no money and she still ate out at a diner. Like go to a fucking vending machine!! Why you gotta leave a waitress STAMPS?! So yeah I'm not surprised at all Cheryl racked up some CC bills while writing this book. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> http://www.wsj.com/articles/why-4-a-m-is-the-most-productive-hour-1471971861

One of the most common challenges to productivity, Dr. Davis says, is that people booby trap their offices with distractions: Desk clutter, email pop-ups, cellphone, Facebook, news feeds. By waking up at 4 a.m., theyve essentially wiped a lot of those distractions off their plate. No one is expecting you to email or answer the phone at 4 a.m. No one will be posting on Facebook. Youve removed the internal temptation and the external temptation.

That really struck me. I get SO distracted if I'm at the computer at 7pm. But like ... 4am is a commitment!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Am I about to write a fluff chapter? Fandom is The Walking Dead but looking for suggestions from fanfic writers! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-17 18:53:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I need help! 

In The Walking Dead story, the characters are in a huge group. So I wanted to whittle them down to a smaller group so things are riskier and there's more at stake! So I had my otp and a few others go on a scavenging hunt to get separated from the rest of the group. 

But now I'm stuck. Things are supposed to ramp up in the next chapter or two, but I find myself in the "quiet before the storm".  

It doesnt make sense for them to head for a scavenging run at dusk, so they went early in the morning. And my last chapter literally ends with them like "let's get to scavenging!" 

And so now I set myself up for this boring ass chapter, I feel like. Scavenging for supplies is an excuse to get them to another important part of the story. But I dont want my readers to know that!  

So now Im dealt with writing this chapter where they're looking for supplies. It has no impact really on the plot. So Im not really sure what to do with the scene. I don't want to skip it because I think it would affect the flow too much and be kind of abrupt. 

Is this a fluff chapter? Any advice to make it not just a line to get from A to B? Halp.  

Examples of what you did would also be helpful.  </TEXT>

Just wondering what reddit thought. Everyone I've asked so far (two people) were pretty adamant the "no ordinary love" doesnt last.

<DATE> 2016-08-09 17:56:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello,

I just checked out [Soul of an Octopus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22609485-the-soul-of-an-octopus) from the library. I've learned octopuses are organized body, head, legs whereas we're head, body legs. And they can taste through their skin. And they can make eye contact with you and they're super smart. They also are in the same animal groups as clams and snails (which are animals that are known for being kinda not smart). And I'm just 5 pages in. 

I also recently downloaded [a book about bats](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23719330-the-secret-lives-of-bats?from_search=true). And I know there was that book one time about the bees (the name escapes me but I remember there was a lot of viral content going around about bees and the end of the world!). 

Anyways, can you share a book about animals that you've read recently (good or bad) and let us know what you learned or thought about the book? 

edit: the plural of octopus is octopuses and octopi because octopus is greek and the -i ending happens after latin stuff. internet, correct me if i'm wrong bc I'm going off memory </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-07-14 18:39:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First round has been chosen, so the draft order is locked. I will have a google docs up by the end of the day today which will show the available athletes you can still choose! But for now ... [just browse these comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/4si4o7/floelite_fantasy_league_reddit_1_peeps_make_your/) and choose someone who hasnt already been chosen. 

Here is the order of the draft for this round: 

1. John H
2. JSRRR
3. Badblood44
4. John M
5. yannism
6. Blok1
7.  Bobackopolis
8. Richiemiz44
9. deppsepp
10. flowseidon
11. Cat
12. subject8145

A few housekeeping things! 

- because we all have lives and schedules, if it's not your turn to choose, feel free to post anyways and give me 3 to 5 choices in the order that you want. if your top choice has already been chosen, i will move to the next available athlete. 

- i need the FloElite usernames for the following redditors: deppsepp, bobackopolis, blok1, yannism, and JSRRR

- if you're in the previous list of names and you signed up for reddit 2 and want to stay in this league, you need to sign up again with a new email address and tell me your name so I can assign you the athlete you've already chosen. (if they don't show up later ... i guess we'll throw that athlete back into the mix :/ ) 

- JSRRR - bill grundler? is he masters? your options are just men, women, and teams. So you get TWO choices. One for your next turn and one to replace Grundler.

<TEXT> I dont mean to cloud up the sub or anything! But since we don't know each other irl, this is the best way I know how to make the draft picks.  Because I'm the commissioner, I have to input your draft picks. 

The order will go like this ... whoever posts first, gets the first draft pick. Second, gets the 2nd draft pick, etc. Once an athlete is chosen, that athlete is no longer eligible for selection. 

For the 2nd round, selection will go from the reverse order. I'll try to tag you guys for the later rounds and post which athletes are still available as pickings go down.  

**Your team will consist of three men, three women, and one affiliate.**

You have by July 14th to make your first pick. If you don't make it, we're moving onto the 2nd round on Jul 15th. Selection should go faster from that point on. Games start July 22nd so hopefully we can figure it out by then!

MAY THE ODDS BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOR

edit: if someone has a good google docs idea, lemme know. 

edit2: After the first round, I will have a google doc up of the draft order and the men, women and teams still available.

<TITLE> Ideas for stories. Do you have too many? Not enough? Where do they come from? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-11 18:50:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> 
I was browsing /r/writing and came across this [BLOGPOST](http://www.neilgaiman.com/Cool_Stuff/Essays/Essays_By_Neil/Where_do_you_get_your_ideas%3F) by Neil Gaiman. 

Every published writer has had it - the people who come up to you and tell you that they've Got An Idea. And boy, is it a Doozy. It's such a Doozy that they want to Cut You In On It. The proposal is always the same - they'll tell you the Idea (the hard bit), you write it down and turn it into a novel (the easy bit), the two of you can split the money fifty-fifty. 

I'm reasonably gracious with these people. I tell them, truly, that I have far too many ideas for things as it is, and far too little time. And I wish them the best of luck. 

The Ideas aren't the hard bit. They're a small component of the whole. Creating believable people who do more or less what you tell them to is much harder. And hardest by far is the process of simply sitting down and putting one word after another to construct whatever it is you're trying to build: making it interesting, making it new. 

I have more ideas than stories in progress ... so I'm good on ideas right now. I dont need anymore at the moment. But they still come. So I just write them in my iPhone Notes and we'll see which one gets to ever see the light of day ...   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was just browsing the NYTimes and came across this article [A Study on Fats that Doesn't Fit the Story Line](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/16/upshot/a-study-on-fats-that-doesnt-fit-the-story-line.html). And I came across this quote: 

It has also added to the growing concern that when it comes to nutrition, personal beliefs often trump science.

Do you feel the Crossfit community tends to do this with the Paleo diet? I feel like a lot of crossfitters stick with paleo, but then you read about heart healthy diets, the paleo lifestyle is not really promoted - [Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/heart-healthy-diet/art-20047702)

<TEXT> Hello r/books! 

It is the first day of summer, the longest day of the year, summer solstice. It is also a time of renewal, a time of freedom, of growth! 

I was curious if you had any books or quotes that reminded you of summer bc F**K WINTER. 

And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.

<TITLE> The Girls (Emma Cline) and American Girls for YA readers: Was this planned? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-14 17:15:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A lot of people have recently posted about Emma Cline's The Girls. Essentially Emma Cline writes about a girl getting caught up in a "Manson-like cult".

Well, I was browsing Amazon and found this in an upcoming June YA releases. The book is called American Girls, about a Manson obsessed 15 year old. 

From the summary: 

Anna is a fifteen-year-old girl slouching toward adulthood, and she's had it with her life at home. So Anna "borrows" her stepmom's credit card and runs away to Los Angeles, where her half-sister takes her in. But LA isn't quite the glamorous escape Anna had imagined.

As Anna spends her days on TV and movie sets, she engrosses herself in a project researching the murderous Manson girlsand although the violence in her own life isn't the kind that leaves physical scars, she begins to notice the parallels between herself and the lost girls of LA, and of America, past and present.

Anyways, I thought that was odd to see two buzzy June books coming out concerning very similar and specific subject matters - one catered to adults and the other to YA.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> I feel bad for saying this but Josh Hartnett is horrible. He takes me out of the immersive experience of the show! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-09 17:42:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Just caught up on the season and after hearing all the rave reviews of the acting with "A Blade of Grass", it got me to thinking about my distaste for Hartnett. Is this just me?  

Ethan is a great role for any actor but whenever Josh Hartnett is on screen, I feel like he knocks the dynamic tempo off between the actors. He has no emotion, no range. He's boring, he's flatter than a week old diet coke. 

It's like Hollywood tried to make Hartnett relevant but Channing Tatum came. Joshua Jackson is another actor in a similar vein of Hartnett's but I feel that Jackson can show a wide range of emotions (like he did in The Affair). Hartnett rarely shows a range of emotion and when he does, he's transitioning into a wolf and the CGI covers up most of that. 

Black Dahlia and Wicker Park were generally viewed as huge disappointments and I don't see Hartnett ever getting the shot at carrying a film again. I think he's lucky that he can piggy back off the great Penny Dreadful cast (even though he's such a vacuum onscreen. It's like ... DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR EYES ... YOUR MOUTH ... CHANGE THE CADENCE TO YOUR SPEECH ARE YOU A WALKING CORPSE? WAKE UP, MAN.). 

Regardless, love the show! Team Dracula though. ANNNNNNND that guy went to Julliard. Very excited :D </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi, 

I browsed the wiki and didn't see any links for what I'm looking for specifically. So I'm just posting!

I've been watching GoT casually since it's inception (the tv show, that is). And each season is building on the previous and I keep losing names/faces. 

So with the most recent episode, Jaime seems to be fighting a Tully's uncle. WHY? Who is he? Have we met him before? And then Sansa and Jon went to that 5 year old's place; have we heard of them before? And then they went to that older guy's place and I totally don't remember his connection to the Boltons. 

And I'm totally lost on Bran and him going into that fugue state where he's observing Ned fighting (and Ned lied about how the fight ended? What was the significance of that?). And then Bran saw the inception of the White Walkers ... I heard there was a Stark connection, but I missed that too while watching the show. 

I get the big picture, but I am definitely missing a lot of information. Is there some type of recap or blog that's available for people like me ... someone that goes through the episode and, perhaps, over explains things? 

Thank you!

<TITLE> Capturing Kids: How to write horror stories for children/teens </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-26 23:48:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi! I'm currently reading Writing Horror: A Handbook by the Horror Writers Association (edited by Mort Castle). I wouldnt bother picking it up unless you're REALLY interested in the title. But I really wanted to share this essay about writing horror stories geared towards MG/YA (Middle Grade, Young Adult). Even if you don't write horror, there's great advice here geared towards MG/YA writers generally. Also, this was compiled around 1997 sooooo I'm sure the landscape has changed. 


This particular post is heavily plagiarized from "Capturing Kids" by Jill M Morgan

A few WARNINGS

1. Be wary writing about witches (the occult); the editors won't buy it. 
2. Don't write on-stage violence in books for kids. Most editors want you to evoke that scary feeling without drawing a single drop of blood from your characters. 

Books exist that break these rules (and they're good books!) but they're not the norm. 

**THE MIDDLE GRADE MARKET** 
(Think "Goosebumps")

Turns out, young readers are loyal. Once they find an author or series they like, they want to read everything from that author or series. Books for kids also have a long shelf life (months, even years compared to adult horror which hovers around 6 weeks). 

A few guidelines for the MG market (8-12 year olds)

1. *Manuscript Length*: Typically, 120 pages. Double-spaced with one inch margins. 
2. *Length of chapters*: Ten pages is about right. Close to ca. 12 chapters per book. 
3. *Point of View (POV)*: Typically, a single-character POV. The protagonist won't know what other characters are thinking but she can observe their actions and expressions and draw conclusions based on that. (Again, this is/was the NORM. Doesnt mean you cant do multiple POVs)
4. *Illustrations*: Not many. Novels that have illustrations at the beginning of each chapter are called chapter books, meant for younger readers. 
5. *Where to begin*: Start on a day that is different. When the 1st chapter opens, the MG reader wants to step right into the setting and the plot. 

*WHERE TO BEGIN EXAMPLES*

"I don't want new friends," said Jenny.

You have a girl with a problem that kids can immediately understand and relate to. They know how miserable she's feeling. What kid hasn't been lonely or afraid to make new friends? 

Another example from Jill Morgan's own book: 

In the morning's rays of sunlight, when the Spider's web ladder was sparkling with dew, Mr. Ambrose descended from the now hidden moon, climbed down the lacy rungs of the Web, and stepped onto the sidewalk before the shop, Broadmore's Used Books and Antiques. 

MG readers have shorter attention spans than YA readers. The horror fiction should be fast paced. They typically want to know what happened, not necessarily why it happened. YA readers enjoy building tension of what might be lurking in the woods, *MG readers want to see the bear*. 

Doesn't mean you write something shallow and hectic. MG readers can be discriminating and they can appreciate rich subplots with fully developed characters with a past, present and future. They like to identify with characters in their fave books and empathy is one of this age group's strongest traits! 

*THE FOLLOWING IS GENERALLY TRUE FOR CHILDREN'S LIT*

1. The main character needs to show growth. Kids' lives are about learning. They are constantly changing, becoming wiser, stronger. The main character in a MG book should demonstrate that type of progression. 

2. The protagonist needs to solve the problem. Not the police, not the parents ... it should be the child protagonist. 

3. Show and not tell. Would you rather read a character telling us how scared they were when the flash flood knocked his house off the foundation OR *showing* the kid falling off the roof of that house, right into the churning water? BE THERE. 

**THE YOUNG ADULT YA MARKET**

1. *Manuscript length*: YA novels are b/n 150-200 pages. (Again, this might be outdated!). 

2. *POV*: It's common to have more than one POV. Keep the POV shifts in separate chapters or sections of chapters. Use a drop down/white space transition or chapter breaks to mark a change in POV. 

3. *Length of chapters*: 10-15 pages is normal.

4. *Setting*: Always seen from the teen's perspective - school, friends' houses, their cars, their rooms, the local pizza joint or other teen hangouts. 

5. *Fear level*: In YA horror, the stakes are higher. The roller coaster thrill ride isn't enough. Keep upping the odds. 

6. *Parents*: YA protagonists should have parents who are like sturdy trees in the background, around for support but rarely noticed. YA horror novels rarely deal with parents. Consider them on vacation from the plot. Parents play a bigger role in MG novels, since younger characters need parents to drive them places. 

7. *Keep it clean*. It's best to keep swearing and 4-letter words to a minimum. Beware of using the latest phrases too. Peppering your dialogue with current slang will date your novel quickly. "Current" doesnt last as long as it used to. Strive for "young but not trendy". 

8. *Sex*. Thinking about the opposite sex *is* the stuff of YA novels. Secret crushes, budding romances are wonderful subplots. Stick to shared glances, a few well-chosen words, hand holding - and THEN: *The* romantic kiss and suggestion of future dating by the book's conclusion. Characters remain chaste. Think of your MG reader as a 9-year old and your YA reader a 12 or 13 year old. But realize that many 10   11 year olds are sampling YA books. The audience is getting younger and younger, which is why it's important to temper violent or sexually explicit scenes. 

**RANDOM ADDENDUMS**

- A large percentage of the kid novel space is dedicated to paperback originals. At paperback prices, kids are able to choose books they want to read, rather than having parents buy the (expensive) hardcovers. Kids know what they like, and they like chillers. 

- Make a point to hang around a group of the age range you're shooting for and listen to their conversations. Are the sentences constructed in the same way adult conversations are? Or do the kids speak to each other in a more choppy, abbreviated style? 

- Recent name-the-baby books can give you good current sounding names (or some buzzfeed list ...). Consider multinational, old-fashioned names or biblical names as well, giving you a chance to really consider your character's traits before you name him or her. 

- Before writing, think about where the real action or excitement begins. Is it where you planned to start? If not, maybe rethink the order of your novel. Kids want to find "the good parts" as soon as they open up the book. 

- Consider where you're going to sell your story or novel. Writing for a specific market will tremendously increase your chances of selling your finished work. 

- You may not have access to an editor, but you do have access to the kinds of novels a particular publishing house seems to prefer. Study your market. Look at what the company is *successful* at publishing. A lot of valuable time can be wasted by sending the wrong kind of proposal to an editor. 

- Pay attention to what *isn't* there. That can mean a lot in publishing too. 

**TLDR;** Know your readers and give them dramatic openings, realistic and likable characters, fast paced chapters and a steady dose of excitement leading to high-peaked thrills. And always remember to keep it clean. Combine this with studying the market, focus your writing on the requirements of specific editors or publishing houses, and noticing what isn't out there as well as what's been overdone. YOU MIGHT GET FAN MAIL FROM KIDS!!

**EPILOGUE:** Turns out capturing kids was more of a hassle than I originally thought. I read this and really wanted to share with the writing community.

<TITLE> Writing Action Scenes </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-26 19:53:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is one of the better essays from Writing Horror: A Handbook by the Horror Writers Association (edited by Mort Castle). I wouldnt bother picking it up unless you're REALLY interested in the title. 

This particular post is heavily plagiarized from "Keep It Moving, Maniacs" by Jay R. Bonansinga

**Establishing a Rhythm**

Find the internal "beat" of the scene and let it drive the prose as a percussionist would drive a band. 

Example: "He cocked the Python as he brought it up *snick snick* and the figure blurred, bloomed bloomed green in his vision . . . . " - Silence of the Lambs

The previous had a bit of a rhythm to it, right? Jay R. wrote an example just for his essay (again, we're not expecting Nobel Prize winning writing from these examples that he puts out). He starts us out with a writer trying to write an action scene: 

Something ominous was brewing. the horror writer had been sensing it for weeks. An imminent change in the weather. 

Jay R. wants to build up tension and excitement, so throws in a little bit of run-on sentences to match the thought patterns of the character. 

... the action began to flow like furious river-rapids, flowing, FLOWING, furiously, carrying the reader away in its currents, and the storm raged in the writer's mind, and the thunder rumbled ... 

The technical tricks you can use are: 

- abruptly inserting an ALL CAPS word to suggest an abrupt change/frenzied chaos 

- alliteration at the right rhythmic point to drive home the unstoppable aspect of your juggernaut 

- sing-song style ("floorboards beginning to quake-quake-quake) to drive home rhythm

- break the scene up using a dash at the end of a sentence and have it open up to a new single phrase paragraph.  (not shown)

**Getting Inside the POV Character**

Example: "When he woke up he was unaware of his consciousness. There was darkness everywhere, on all sides." Clive Barker

Suspense looks boring form a distance. But when viewed up close, things can get dramatic. Look at an anthill from a distance, it ain't no thang. But get to their size, woah, shit's real cray.

Jay R's example: 

At first, it was nothing more than a subtle, metronomic beat in his head, a rhythmic ticking that began to build as he wrote the next suspense sequence. He began to hear a sort of internal percussion, complete with cymbal crashes, tempo changes, drum solos and a constant beat underscoring it all. . . . 

When the action kicks in, the scene should always be perceived (when possible) from the inside character. When gunshots are fired, don't merely describe how they sound to the characters, describe how they feel. When someone is hurt, dont merely describe the blood and guts, describe the mind ... what the pain and the fear feels like. 

"With apologies to Galileo, in action scenes, the universe revolves around the central characters."

Action can only be generated through *character*. We must know your characters quirks, we must know he has an adjustable rate mortgage going through the roof and his kid just got back from the orthodontist with a mouth full of metal. Then, and only then, do we care about the character. 

And action is a virus .. it spreads. So if you jump from one poitn of view to another, you can really tighten the suspense and intensify the action. 

**Engaging the Environment**

To prevent your work from getting into slapstick comedy use your environment. 

If we go back to Silence of the Lambs (Spoilers ahead if you havent watched the movie and yes Im judging you) ... Clarice Starling is in the killer's cellar. She has just found dead people and and she knows the killer is hiding somewhere in the basement, waiting for her. Suddenly, the lights go out and we see Starling stumbling around in the dark, banging into things, etc ... add a laugh track to that and you have a screwball comedy! But watch her touch the hot furnace pipes and trip over her own feet through the infrared green of the killer's gaze and now it's frightening.  

One of the tricks is to find artifacts in the environment - hot furnace pipes, wallpaper separating, plaster crumbling - and integrate them into the action. It reinforces the authenticity of the action scene (this kind of stuff naturally occurs all the time, right?) and it also can intensify the experience for the reader. 

**Seasoning Your Scenes with Detail**

Horror Fiction (and probably scifi) perhaps more than any other genre depends on a suspension of disbelief. 

In the short story "On the Slab" by Harlan Ellison, our hero has to fight a giant bird that has arrived from the netherworld and crashed through a skylight. Our hero rips a fire extinguisher from the wall ... 

 ... the virulent Halon 1301 mixture sprayed in a white stream over the bird's head. The mixture of fluorine, bromine, iodine, and chlorine washed the vulture, spurted into its eyes, filled its mouth.

Amid the action, we get the chemical minutiae of the fire extinguisher. Because we get the detail, we can almost see smell and taste the terror through dreamlike reportage. These minute details can give us texture to a story. 

**Funneling Time**

Good literary action should feel like an inverted funnel. So as a scene progresses, time should compress in on itself. 

Jay R's examples starts off describing weeks. Then, days. Then, hours: 

The horror writer had been sensing it for weeks. An imminent change in the weather .... 
Then, late one night, alone in his cluttered little garret, he decided to let it happen. He felt a weird certainty deep down in his marrow as he poured the first few fingers of the evening's espresso and lit his first Camel straight .... 

And then he starts to compress the time further. Tension mounts, and as the words start flowing, the passage of time is tightened down to a moment by moment roller coaster: 

At first, it was nothing more than a subtle, metronomic beat in his head .... He began to hear a sort of internal percussion ... 

... and the action began to flow like furious river-rapids, flowing, FLOWING, furiously, carrying the reader away in its currents ... 

**The Final Blow**

You're in the car accident. You, the writer, are in the driver's seat. You feel everything; you sense time is slowing down and all you can do is watch the horrifying movie in your mind. "Think of that feeling - the way movement seems to blur and get all bogged down like a taffy pull. That's the moment just before impact. Find the literary equivalent and you'll be holding your reader rapt."

**FINAL THOUGHTS** 

The key to writing excellent action is PERCEPTION. The rhythm, the POV, the environment, the detail ... it's all filtered through human perspective. 

That's what action is. 

A human being in peril - forced to *perceive*.

<TITLE> Some Thoughts About Dialogue </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-18 20:37:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello,

Again, I'm reading this collection of essays on writing horror. And I came across this one. Always use your best judgment when writing! The following is stylistic advice from writer David Morrell. 

These are mainly DO NOTs. However, there are exceptions to every rule! But if you find yourself repeatedly making these mistakes, you might want to live by these "do nots" for awhile until you can get away from some of these common crutches that aren't doing your dialogue any favors. 

**BE CAREFUL REPEATING THE PERSON'S NAME WITHIN THE DIALOGUE. PEOPLE SELDOM ADDRESS EACH OTHER LIKE THIS ANYWAYS**

"Jane, I'm going downtown to the library," Dick said.

"Okay, Dick, I'll see you later," Jane said. 

Reads a little silly, right? People tend to address other people by their names in movies. But movies have to identify the characters on screen. And fiction writing is not movie writing. 

Try to use names in dialogue only when it's unavoidable - egs. the start of a telephone conversation, during a dark scene in a basement, or when there is no other way for the reader to find out a name. 

**LIMIT YOUR SPEECH TAGS**

"I'll track you down and kill you!" Jane hissed. 

You can't hiss if you don't use sibilants (and there aren't any in this speech). "Jane growled"? It won't work. "Jane spat"? Have you ever seen anyways spit while they speak? Similarly, characters shouldnt bark, rasp or rumble their dialogue. At the end of the day, this draws unwanted attention to your dialogue. 

Restrict the verbs used in speech tags to "said" and "asked." In extreme cases, use "demanded," "insisted" or "shouted" and "screamed"? Maybe "whispered" or "murmured." But don't use many.  

**DO YOU EVEN NEED YOUR SPEECH TAGS IN THE FIRST PLACE?** 

"I'll track you down and kill you!" Jane said.

"I'll track you down and kill you!" Jane shouted.

"Said" is an understatement after the exclamation point. And "shouted" is redundant. 

Do you even need the speech tag? 

"I'll stab you in your sleep." Jane's eyes meant every word. 

No one is going to win any writing awards with that sentence, but why not include description a little at a time ... where you would normally have a fill-in-the-blank speech tag? Speech tags are intended to just identify the speaker. If you don't need it, don't use it. 

But, no one is against speech tags completely! They're needed at times, as we mentioned. And they can create interesting effects - like a pause, for example: 

"I know he doesn't believe I'll come after him," Jane said. "His mistake." 

**SPEECH TAGS: ADVERBS**

"I gave that jerk the best three days of my life," Jane said bitterly. 

It's redundant. Resist using adverbs. Having the dialogue communicate what it is supposed to will help you not have to use the adverb. The adverb just points out that you failed in communicating what you were supposed to. 

Exception: A speech tag's adverb might be acceptable if the dialogue is meant to be spoken in contradiction to its apparent sense. 

"I gave that jerk the best three days of my life," Jane said proudly. 

**PUNCTUATION**

"You son of a bitch, I hate your guts" Jane shouted. 

The speech tag is redundant, and so is the exclamation point, which is implied by "You son of a bitch." With the following example, the intensity is there, but the staginess/camp has been eliminated" 

"You son of a bitch, I hate your guts." Jane's gaze never left his. 

Now, onto the exclamation point. 

"My God, she's got a knife!"

vs. 

 
"My God, she's got a knife."

I don't miss the exclamation point. And you don't want your page littered with exclamation points; you don't want to stab your reader's eyes with !!!s. 

If you would like to add emphasis to a question, resist the following:

"What am I going to do?!" Jane exclaimed. 

Let's try: 

Jane could barely get the words out. "What am I going to do?" 

or 



"*What am I going to do?*" Jane stared at every face in the library. 

The italics can serve the same function as an exclamation point. Just use it in moderation. But if the question has some for of cursing, the italics become redundant just as an exclamation mark is redundant after a statement that contains cursing. 

**COLLOQUALISMS**

William Strunk's Element of Style - also very much against colloquialisms and slang! 

Use them in *extreme moderation*. 

"Well," "Yeah, "You know," "okay," and the like are necessary to create the illusions of verisimilitude, but unless Jane is a Valley Girl and vapid expressions are a method of characterizing, writer beware! The words don't say anything, after all. They are blank spots on the page and impede the flow of your story. 

Slang is also a form of colloquialism. It's necessary to enliven dialogue, but unfortunately current slang quickly becomes dated. 

"That's cool. Give me a high five." 

Unless you're writing a parody, most writers distance themselves from slang. 

Next, don't upstage your dialogue with trying to imitate accents. 

"Dinja know he wuz gonna gitcha?" 

Your character might talk like this, but most of the time, your reader will note the unusual spelling and have to slow their reading to understand what the character is actually saying. Use it when you need to, but perhaps you don't have to use so much of it? 

"Didn't you know he was gonna get you?" 

For some people tastes, the single misspelling adequately conveys the character's illiteracy - without obstructing your narrative. 

That being said, we are writing fanfiction so you are allowed to throw all these rules out the door! Just passing out food for thought, I said. 


**WHAT ARE YOUR DIALOGUE TIPS?** 

(I've suggested people read their narrative out loud to see if it flows, and this particular guy suggested *against* that. He's like - write the visual cues because you cant guarantee your reader will add inflection and tone where you're adding it.) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Saw this writing advice for horror writers (I think it applies to crossover fanfic) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-04 18:06:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm reading *Writing Horror*. The book essentially gives pretty standard, duh writing advice so I would not recommend it for most readers.  But after coming across [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/4d1vbl/has_anyone_ever_told_you_your_writing_is_not/) AND after reading "No Shield of Disbelief by Dominick Cancilla, I thought I'd share this viewpoint with you guys. I think it applies really well to crossovers and even some of the existing universes that fanfic writers deal with ... but they like to add their own twist on it.  

Here we go: 

- It is usually a good idea to keep a fictional universe as close to reality as possible. A short story should differ from accepted reality in *a single way*. Too much deviation from our accepted world as we know it will strain the reader's credulity or demand too much explanation. 

- Once you decide how reality will be twisted, you must stick with it and keep it in mind for the duration of the work. That means not changing the rules midstream or introducing additional unbelievables in the last sentence to create a "surprise" ending. 

CONSISTENCY IS THE CORE OF BELIEVABILITY. 

A reader will find no tension in a world where everything is apparently possible. Or they will wonder why fantastic things are so little used. (So, if you have no limits on a witch's powers, the reader will wonder, "Why is the witch making things so hard for herself, why doesnt she just make herself beautiful and give herself a lot of money?")

An extension of this: You have a group of vampires that decide to use a town for "cattle". How do the vampires keep the town in check?  What are the vampire's supernatural powers in YOUR world? Were they made by science? This might seem like a TON of work. But how are you going to feel when you write a nice story and your readers undermine it all because they start commenting, "Why don't the villagers just leave during the day when the vampires are asleep?" 

Also, though the unusual exists in your fictive universe, the inhabitants, your characters, might not necessarily know it. They should react appropriately. 

egs. Muggles being exposed to wizardy in the HP Universe. How would they react? 

Or if you have a Mummy/House MD crossover, a  skeptic, like House MD (he is a skeptic right?) sees the mummy ... he will think it's a person in monstrous makeup rather than a supernatural corpse. 

Or if a portal opens up and sucks the a building into it and those are NOT the mechanics in the universe, your character is probably NOT going to be merely curious ... they're going to run, scream hysterically, whatever ... they're going to freak out

If a story 

- believes in the unreality it is presenting 

- the characters react appropriately 

- the logic and mechanics are consistent 

- well-defined limits for man, nature and monster are set

THEN your tale will not be overburdened by the unbelievable. The reader will be DENIED their shield of disbelief, and the horrors you present will strike marrow and bone.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've posted drabbles and short 4-5 chapter things after I've writtten the whole thing. But with my longer work, I'm posting chapters as I write them. I have a direction I want the story to go. And I know some things that will happen that I'm trying to foreshadow. But, once I post a chapter, like ... it's locked. And I can't really "fix" anything. 

Have any of you guys tried both? Posting as you go versus writing the work out completely then posting chapters frequently? 

I see that having it completely written out and posting it with regularity is probably best for everyone. Butttttt as I'm writing, I like the rush I get from posting a chapter!  </TEXT>

If

- You tell 15 friends about your screenplay idea, but devote zero time in your week to facing the blank screen.
- You buy a domain name, spend weeks or months researching and reading up on how to build a website, but you dont actually install WordPress.
- You have a drawer full of half-finished stories and novels and a to-do list item every week that reads, work on writing.
- Youve read 15 free online guides to blogging, built three editorial calendars, have notes on a dozen posts, but you havent gone live with your blog.
- You have binders of lore and no book.

^^ thats all c/o the linked blog post. 

Anyways, if you're thinking too much about a project, maybe pull yourself out of perfecting it in your head and get to working on the darn thing! Which goes for me too. Since I'm posting on reddit and not working on my magnus opus right now ...  </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Power of Daily Writing in a Journal - Charley Kempthorne claims to have written 10million words in his. Do you have any daily rituals that involve writing routines? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-28 20:12:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was reading this article in Wall Street Journal (sorry it's a pay to read but here's [the link](http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-power-of-daily-writing-in-a-journal-1453837329) ... )

I'm going to recount the beginning of the article (ie, plagiarize). Charley Kempthorne started journaling in 1964. These days he logs b/n 1-3k words a day. And he thinks his journal is roughly 10 million words long. Once a month, he'll print the last 30 entries and puts it in a 3-ring binder. The binders take up about 15 feet of shelf space. No one, including his wife, has read it. 

Now he posts some on facebook and [his website](http://www.thelifestoryinstitute.com/). He says he tends to pick  words more careful when writing for the world to see bc you dont want to be judged or hurt someone's feelings. 

Journaling helps him understand his life better and can be quite therapeutic. "Taking 15 or 20 minutes to write freely about emotions, secrets or upheaval can be a powerful tonic ... when you translate an emotional experience into words, it organizes them in ways not organized before. It makes them simpler and easier to get past." - James Pennebaker, author of Writing to Heal. 

One of Kempthorne's first entries was the following: 
I have decided to be a writer. I will it, thus: I am a writer. Now - by definition if for no other reason, writers are distinguised chiefly by the fact that they write. I must write - two hours a day until I finish school. 


Just sharing. Seems to be a theme I've encountered recently.  A friend swears by the 5 minute journal (I think that's a Tim Ferris thing). I've thumbed through The Artists Way by Julia Cameron. And I am currently reading Daily Rituals where the author recounts famous writers, composers, philosophers, etc daily routines. many of the routines include writing ... and drinking :D 

From the Wall Street article, here is a list of how to build a daily writing habit: 

- Write 500 words/day for 28 consecutive days, preferably at the same time and same place to create a routine
- Don't worry about grammar or punctuation. Be willing to write badly. Authenticity is more important than excellence.

<TITLE> Generally speaking, are there common usages for rape/noncon in fanfic? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-27 20:16:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi, I have a crap ton of questions about rape/non-con in fanfics. Answer all, answer some, or just throw out an opinion ...  

Typically, what is rape used for in a story? Does it move the plot forward or is it just another version of smut to read ?

Does the victim end up falling in love with their attacker? Or does the victim get revenge on the person? 

Is the person doing the raping the "hero" or the protagonist of the story? Or a villain?

Do all these answers change depending on the fandom? 

Does it change depending on the m/m, m/f, f/f?? 

Does violent sex get tagged as non-con? 

I"m not familiar with the tag, nor do I think I ever will be. But I am definitely curious of how this is used in fanfic.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have sent two of my characters on a scavenging journey. And as a side piece they are going to do something important to the plot. But I had to get them out of their initial scenario first, so I sent them on a scavenge (which is common in the fandom). 

My question is I dont want to write out the act of scavenging - rummaging through people's houses to bring back supplies. It doesnt really add to the plot, honestly. 

Would it be bad form to just have one of the characters be like "Whew that scavenging sure was bullshit but  necesseary haha" and then move on with the story?  Or should I have a "scene" happen there? Like I could add some foreshadowing and character building ... because i think the fandom likes the interaction of the two characters ... but, at the end of the day, I think it's just a dead scene. And *I'm* the one writing it! So if I think it's going to be bad ... haha </TEXT>

<TITLE> Crossovers: 2 questions on reader preferences (and a bonus question for TVD and True Blood fans!) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-30 18:26:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm just going to throw out fandoms I know, but you should get the idea. 

Say I had an idea for a True Blood/Vampire Diaries crossover (no, no, don't go anywhere, stay with me). 

FIRST QUESTION: There seems to be a general consensus that it's preferable for the characters of one story to end up in the "world" of the other. So you basically have ONE setting and you stay true to the rules of that particular universe. Is that a correct assumption? 

PIGGY BACK QUESTION: so in TVD, some vampires can walk in the day because of "magical" rings. But in True Blood, the vampires are toast; magic doesnt fix that (fairy blood does, but only for short moements). Suffice to say that "day walking" is a VERY big deal in True Blood universe but seems par for the course in TVD. 

Another note, the vampires as a whole in the True Blood universe seem to be stronger and more violent. 

If I set the story in the True Blood setting and brought over two of the TVD characters, I would expect the TVD vampires' day rings to still work. So I would like the day walking rings to NOT work on the True Blood vampires but still work with the TVD vampires. My thinking is that the vampires have different origination stories and, therefore, have different abilities. Plus, it gives TVD vampires an advantage over the True Blood vampires, even though the True Blood vampires seem a lot stronger. 

Does this make sense to treat the vampires as monkeys versus apes? Just different evolutionary chains off the same tree? (Note: I dont know the particulars of evolution so dont shoot me if monkeys and apes arent the best comparison). Or should I just have the day rings not work at all in the True Blood universe? 

LAST QUESTION: Those who have written crossovers, do your readers get "upset" with how you treat inconsistencies between the universes? Do you have tips on how to handle inconsistencies? Dont mention it in your work, pick one over the other, or what? </TEXT>

<TEXT> For some reason, I LOVE true crime shows. I was introduced to the "genre" by watching 48 hours and Dateline. And ever since then, I've been hooked. 

My favorite true crime is, by far, A Crime to Remember (on ID channel). Most of the stories are set in periods before computers, forensics, and Miranda Rights being a "thing". In one of the episodes, the FBI had to fly a set of fingerprints to a jurisdiction so they could compare fingerprints found at a crime scene. 

I couldnt imagine what people used to get away with. 

So I choose A Crime to Remember.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Any Alan Moore fans? He answered 75 questions for Horror Week on Goodreads. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Goodreads Link](https://www.goodreads.com/author/3961.Alan_Moore/questions)

*What happens to you when you write?*

**Alan Moore** I probably shouldnt play favourites, but for my money this is perhaps the most interesting question Ive been asked all year. I dont know. I dont know what happens to me when I write, because Im not sure if we have adequate language to describe, even to ourselves, what it is to use language in a purposeful way. I know that my consciousness, if I am immersed in writing something demanding, is moved into a completely different state than the one which I inhabit during most of my waking life. Neither is it like dreaming, having much more focus and control. If Im writing, as I often do, something which requires messing around with the structure or vocabulary of the English language, then I find myself entering some very unusual mental spaces indeed. Writing the Lucia Joyce chapter of Jerusalem, Round the Bend, I found myself in a kind of synaptic cascade-state that had a delirious, mind-expanding bliss to it. By contrast, writing the collapsed future-vernacular of Crossed +100, I found myself ending up slightly depressed just by the experience of having a limited language with a subsequently limited number of things that the characters could think, or feel, or conceive of. What I suspect is happening is that, as started earlier, our entire neurological reality can be seen as being made from words at its most immediate level. When you descend into this level of our reality, the code of our reality if you like, then whether consciously or not; whether deliberately or not, you are working magic. So, the answer to your question as to what happens to me when I write, is the most banal and useless answer you will ever get from an author: the magic happens. I hope that the fact that its me saying that and that I mean the above statement with absolute conviction, along with all of its potentially frightening implications, will be enough to make it sound a little less fatuous. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sex aside ... who is using who? 

There have been some camera angles and things where we know Allison is a snake. She was trying to backdoor Saul during the leaks. We saw her face when Assad's plane blew up ... *she knew*. 

Also, her station got the information leaked in the first place AND they lost the blogger when they were tracking her (with the fire alarm) and I STILL think that she's either totally inept or she's letting that happen on purpose. 

So she has some other agenda besides Saul's version of what the CIA's agenda is to say the least. 

I'm confused about Saul. 

He HAS to know that she's a mole. What is he getting from Allison? 

Seems like with his ex-wife Mira cheating on him ... that Saul would be quite a bit hip to the wily ways of women. I'm just not sure what he's getting out of her to keep furthering this relationship.  </TEXT>

Daryl seems to be softening quite a bit. And I'm not quite sure *who* Morgan is right now. It's like Morgan is more of a paternal figure to Rick and Daryl is the fraternal.

<TITLE> Losing weight: is it really just as simple as calories in versus calories out? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-10-02 23:07:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was reading this article from Atlantic: [Why It Was Easier to Be Skinny in the 1980s](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/09/why-it-was-easier-to-be-skinny-in-the-1980s/407974/)

The article makes the following claim: 
people today are about 10 percent heavier than people were in the 1980s, even if they follow the exact same diet and exercise plans.

The reasons which might cause this to be so were stated in the article as the following: 

First, people are exposed to more chemicals that might be weight-gain inducing. Pesticides, flame retardants, and the substances in food packaging might all be altering our hormonal processes and tweaking the way our bodies put on and maintain weight.

Second, the use of prescription drugs has risen dramatically since the 70s and 80s. Prozac, the first blockbuster SSRI, came out in 1988. Antidepressants are now one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in the U.S., and many of them have been linked to weight gain.

Finally, Kuk and the other study authors think that the microbiomes of Americans might have somehow changed between the 1980s and now. Its well known that some types of gut bacteria make a person more prone to weight gain and obesity. Americans are eating more meat than they were a few decades ago, and many animal products are treated with hormones and antibiotics in order to promote growth. All that meat might be changing gut bacteria in ways that are subtle, at first, but add up over time. Kuk believes the proliferation of artificial sweeteners could also be playing a role.

Just some food for thought. 


I personally think 100 calories of a fruit or veggie would be preferred over 100 calories of starburst the candy! But it seems when ONLY talking about weight loss, those two scenarios would result in the same output (ie. scale weight) when it came to the calories in versus calories out purists. I just can't envision your body processing those two scenarios the same way though. But, I am no scientist. I'm just going off intuition.  </TEXT>

Which brings me to TWD when the city apparently got napalmed? Did that effectively kill the walkers? Did the military expect that the napalm wouldnt have 100% kill rate? Did it have 100% kill rate? Do I not understand bombs and napalm? 

Im asking if corralling zombies and bombing them would be better than just killing them one by one with headshots?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, Ive recently listened to a few audiobooks read by the author. Bill Bryson, Amy Poehler, Aziz Ansari ... 

Comedians are the best because instead of reading it in their voice, you're actually hearing it how they envisioned it. (I have George Carlin one to listen to next, it just wouldnt be the same from a different narrator!)

But I'm currently listening to Chris Hadfeld's An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth ... and I just LOVE how he narrates his audiobook as well as the subject matter! Must be all that military training and talking into mics. 

Do you guys have any authors that read their own books and really enjoyed the experience? Please share  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, 

I got a ticket for an expired tag (I got it about 10 days after my b'day). So I'm guilty. 

Does anyone know if the Marietta courts are reasonable? I have never gone to court. I've always just paid the fine. But I'm SUPER broke right now. 

Tips or insight would help.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Does anyone add a pinch of sea salt to their water? (Warning: Pee talk) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-08-14 17:52:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Background: I HATE drinking water. I will typically drink just when I'm thirsty or if I KNOW I'm going to hot yoga or a long workout where I just need to be hydrated. I dont ever *feel* dehydrated but after some workouts, not gonna lie, I guzzle water. 

The reason why I don't like drinking water is that I feel it goes right through me. Like I will drink water and then 10 minutes later, I'm peeing out basically clear liquid. I HATE that. 

Also, when I am about to work out, I have to get out my pre-workout pee. And it's literally just a tinkle. And that's annoying. 

Sidenote: I sweat. A lot. 

So, I was halfway listening to a podcast with Tim Ferris/Kelly Starrett (so dont quote me on any of this!). And I just heard them say something like how plain water is just "diluting your body" and then one of the guys said something about how he adds a pinch of sea salt to his water. And it gets into the body a bit better (like tendons and stuff? I dont know I wasnt really paying attention). But I do have a chemistry degree and I know that salts and ionic things facilitate the movement of water bc it's polar. So, I dont know, it made sense and I thought, hey, why not try it out. 

So I added a pinch of sea salt to my water yesterday. 

And I didnt pee out all the water. I went to the bathroom a normal amount of time. Like 3 times at work. 

And I went to the gym. I only lifted, but I didnt sweat that much at all! Like our gym doenst have AC so Im typically dripping sweat (and we're in 90 degree/humid weather most of the time). I didnt do my nervous pee either. 

I'm probably retaining some of the water, but it's only a PINCH of salt. So I wouldnt think it'd be like eating a bag of potato chips. I cant even taste the salt in the water, so I couldnt imagine it making THAT much of a difference. Like maybe I'm biasing my experiences to favor putting sea salt in my water? 

I'm going to try this out for a few weeks. 

Has ANYONE else heard of putting sea salt in their water? And what would be the positive benefits of doing so? I cant find much with a google search so I thought maybe you guys might have heard things? Broscience thoughts appreciated.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just picked this collection of short stories off of amazon. And I am kind of impressed. I havent really read TONS of horror - basically Dracula (bram stoker, which was a snooze fest for me), and The Haunting of HIll House (shirley jackson, which I LOVED but some of the characters were a bit comical and silly). 

Unseaming came out in 2014 and the stories really remind me of modern day horror movies at times! I just got done reading the 2nd short story where, every morning, everyone in the world wakes up covered in blood that has come out of their pores. And no one knows why!

I did a search and didnt find the book mentioned so just throught I'd throw this out to the horror readers! </TEXT>

They didnt for Sasha. But I have heard Sasha is taking on a role of one of the comic book characters.... I don't think Tara is really "crucial" to the larger plot in play. 

And it's not like they can be like - oops Tara fell on a penis. 

Tara is such a minor character though. I think they would go on with the show with her written as is.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can watch the upcoming Live Streams on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/CrossFitHQ

The schedule is [here](https://games.crossfit.com/schedule). 

And the list of workouts is [here](http://games.crossfit.com/workouts/games). 

Most of the individual and Team events will be on ESPN. But if you're outside the US, you can stream most everything on youtube, I think. 

There are just some great athletes: Lauren Fisher is on Teams this year (so is Miranda Oldroyd). Anna Tunnicliffe is an ex-Olympian. Camille Leblanc-Bazinet's pictures get thrown around everywhere on the internet. Elisabeth Akinwale is Strong af. Brooke Wells, Brooke Ence, Kara Webb, the Icelandic women ... like it should be good times this weekend. 

Again, a lot of those "fitspiration" photos (which is a whole other topic) has a lot of Crossfit females on it. 

I know crossfit gets tons of hate on /r/Fitness but Crossfit is like 60% females in most crossfit gyms. And it's not perfect, but most of the gyms out there try for safe, fun programming!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whats the best or funniest piece of Sherlock fan fiction or fan art youve seen?

I dont know the funniest. Theres been some eye-watering stuff of Benedict and Martin together. A load of it has been superb. Theres a tendency to disparage it. I dont agree. Even the slash fiction, thats a great way to learn to work. No one really does three-act structure, but just trying to put words that make somebody else turned on, thats going to teach you more about writing than any writing college you can go to. Its creative and exciting. I refuse to mock itbecause Im a man who writes Sherlock Holmes fan fiction for a living!

Thank you guys for subscribing to this subreddit. I have finally deleted the blogspam. Thank you for the reports.

I'm not a "trained" moderator or anything. I just really love the nutritarian lifestyle. But I'm learning, and I will try to keep the page looking a little cleaner. 

Whether or not something is blogspam or not is up to my discretion (for now). But typically, if you have a new reddit account and the link is low quality (in terms of information) and the ads are pretty obvious, your link will be marked as spam or removed. 

Thank you! </TEXT>

Do you write it as you post it and just finish chapters each week? What if it's not completely to your liking or you get writers' block? Do you have a full-time job?? Like how do you have time to do this/?

I'm more curious how the post-as-you-write people do it. . . . I have a full time job and I like to work out and watch tv and I teach yoga every now and then, so I struggle with time management. . . .  </TEXT>

Also (I sound like a broken record) Unbroken by Laura Hillenbrand, the story of WWII Olympian Louis Zamperini ... his life was like one amazing or catastrophic thing or the other. He certainly lived on the edges of life. 

I read both of these (not audiobooks), but I assume The Martian (Andy Weir) and Silo (Hugh Howey) would be similar.

<TITLE> Kinda serious question: What's up with the Hawks? Why do they keep winning? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-24 04:56:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi! I'm a long time Georgian. And I automatically root for the Braves and Falcons and Hawks. My parents even have a signed ball or something from Lenny Wilkins. 

But I've definitely not kept up with the Hawks. Obviously, they've been on an amazing winning streak. But they don't have any "huge" names that I know (like people who have played on the USA Olympic Team). I'm just curious how they're winning. Is there a standout player? Good defense? Good offense? Turnovers? What makes them better than the other guys?? 

Thank you! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Gone Girl was great and all. But I'm just wondering if the whole unreliable narrator thing is going to be the next best trend in bestseller fiction. Sometimes these "what *really* happened" stories can turn into the author pulling an ending out of their ass. Before I Go To Sleep by SJ Watson (I felt) did this. The ending just kind of comes out of nowhere. 

Anyways, reader beware.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi!

This is my first time doing Whole30. I'm doing it with my gym and it's a HUGE motivation to see the pics of what the other people are eating for the Whole30 Challenge. 

But I was at a local farmers market and they had a young coconut for $0.99. I've never even messed around with coconuts at THAT stage of their lifecycle but I thought I'd try it out for 99 cents. Worse case scenario, I'd be out a buck. 

I got the recipe from [breaking muscle](http://breakingmuscle.com/nutrition/cuckoo-for-coconuts-how-to-buy-and-eat-young-coconuts). 

* 1 young coconut - the water inside and the meat
* 2 spoonfuls of raw almond butter (or 1/4 cu almonds but the blog recommends almond butter)
* 5 pitted dates
* 1/2 cu water
* ca. 4 ice cubes

I added some cinnamon (I accidentally dumped probably too much in). used this expensive nut butter from costco, and didnt use the ice cubes (but I did stick my drink in the fridge bc it was too warm for me!). 

I just want to make two comments. 

1. If you're missing dairy, this was the most milkish thing I've experienced! With the cinnamon, it tasted like leftover milk from cereal. 
2. I feel like dates are cheating. They sweeten everything. They are amazing. I've used them in a few smoothies and, oh my gosh, so sweet. 

This is my first Whole30, so let me know if something is not "compliant". I know smoothies are not the first thing to grab on Whole30. But they really do satiate me, and I find them pretty convenient for me. 

Anyways, here's an [album](http://imgur.com/a/gdEnO) of the drink. SO GOOD.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For a ao3 thing, I signed up for Yuletide not really understanding how it worked. One of my options was Homeland (which I ended up having to write for). It's on Showtime and the main characters work for the CIA and generally go after terrorists in the Middle East. 

Turns out, I have NO CLUE about the culture in the Middle East. I couldnt really come up with a plot that was CIA related. I feel like I should get a u tried anyways award. 

I will probably NEVER write a Doctor Who fic (even though I love the show) because I don't know anything about British culture or speak. 

And I just got into watching Penny Dreadful, and I would probably be dreadful at that because I dont think I could write their speech convincingly enough. 

Even with The Walking Dead, I have trouble with the gun scenarios bc I know nothing about how to handle or store guns. 



Here is my first CIA story ... http://archiveofourown.org/works/2907656?view_full_work=true

Also, if you have any suggestions for writing CIA stuff, I'd appreciate it. I bought some Homeland books. So I'll read those and see if I'm just trying to overcomplicate things.

<TEXT> Seems like my writing includes a lot of "grabbed" and "looked". And I can maybe use "clutched" "seized" for grabbed. And "Gaze" or "stare" for look ... but, I dont know. Is there something stylistically I could do to get away from these words? 

If there's a quiet moment in a conversation, how do you convey that person A looked at person B. Moments passing? 


And it seems like my writing involves people picking things up in a hurry. They snatch it or they grab it. That's all I got!

I have to think this is just me making poor stylistic choices. 

Do other people have this issue with other words? Or am I just not thinking outside the box with my descriptions?  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi, I dont really post here that much (probably obvious by the thread title). 

But I saw that Chris Rock made the following comment: 

Tupac might be a political leader if he was alive, but then again, Tupac might be in a Tyler Perry movie right now, so you dont know.

I ALWAYS thought if Tupac were still around, he'd be more political. He's not like Snoop or anything. 

But then I read that Chris Rock thing about Tyler Perry and I just wonder "wow, *would he* be up in Tyler Perry movies?"

What say you guys? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Crimson Peak directed by Guillermo del Toro, starring Jessica Chastain, Tom Hiddleston, Charlie Hunnam, Mia Wasikowska ... I'm kind of excited about it? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-20 04:18:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This post is just going to be me rambling ... 

But first off, I'm doubtful if this movie will be "true" horror ... I wonder if it'll come across as more of a dark thriller (kind of like Sleepy Hollow ... which I love but I wouldnt really call it "horror"). I know Jessica Chastain has done Horror before (with Mama). And I'm kind of surprised seeing her in another horror movie since she was in a freakin Nolan movie. But I guess if Del Toro is at the helm ... why not? 

Tom Hiddleston is wonderful. But I've only really seen him in something a bit darker in the movie Only Lovers Left Alive (which was not my cup of tea and sucked). 

I saw Mia Wasikowska in Stoker and she was phenomenal in it. But Stoker was definitely more of a thriller/drama. She was also in Only Lovers Left Alive with Tom H. And she basically carried the movie Tracks, and that's getting pretty good reviews. 

These quotes are from the Entertainment Weekly blurb about this movie. 

Chastain: 
It was really draining, emotionally and spiritually.... The experience took more out of me than anything I'd ever done. When I finished I had to take some time off. 

del Toro has said: 
It's very much in an old mold with a little bit of extra depravity and brutality sprinkled in."


Del Toro was also said to have found inspiration from classic goth films like *Rebecca* and *The Innocents* (and I've neither seen nor heard of either). 

The movie is set in the 19th century. Mia has just married Tom and she finds out he's a tad bit ... off. Jessica Chastain players Mia's sister in law. Charlie Hunnam plays Christian Grey jk the Doctor. 

I'm just really curious how "scary" this movie will be. They seemed to have pulled a good director and a high dollar cast. I'm under the impression that most horror doesnt really bring in the big bucks or big awards .... so I'm really looking forward to a trailer so I can kind of get a better grasp of this film! </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Discussion] [5x07] In defense of Tyreese and my future prediction for Rick </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-25 07:03:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So Tyreese's demeanor seems to frustrate people. 

But I had a random thought 

If Tyreese was a more violent person, a badass as some might say, would he have been able to forgive Carol for killing Karen? Tyreese was about to start something GREAT with Karen. And Carol admits that she killed Karen, slides a gun across the table to Tyreese and tells him to do what he has to do.  So what would a *badass* do in that situation? We know what Tyreese did. He forgave Carol, picked up Judith, and got the hell out of dodge. 
 
Earlier, when Rick found out, he kicked Carol out of the prison, that's essentially killing her. Like what chance does ANYONE have out there on their own? 


I'm just going to talk about violence and humanity now and I'm going to try and bring it all back to Rick. 

It seems like people are VERY annoyed with some of the more peaceful suggestions ... itt's boring, it's "stupid", it's "bad writing". 

In 5x07, people are annoyed at the rest of the group for not letting Rick just go in guns a-blazing, Columbine style up into that hospital. And when Daryl talked Rick back saying 3s better than 2, people were annoyed that Rick didnt just up and shoot the guy. 

And I've said this in other threads but does Batman kill the villains? No. Thats what makes Batman the GOOD GUY. 

I think Ricks hardened view of the world is going to get reinforced in the MSF (bc how can it NOT!). He's right. The group is probably going to get further damaged from this "trade" with the hospital. They should have not given the hospital a CHANCE to make the right decision. Rick got burned with The Governor and Terminus. And this time will probably be the last straw (on an unimpressive foe, by the way ... which is, again, I think good writing ... bc these people are a bit more "grey" than the governor or the termites)

So after the MSF, Rick is going to become more violent. And hes going to make a wrong call and kill a good guy out there. Not just leave the backpack guy running after them .. but actively kill a good, honest person.

And when does Rick become one of the assholes that hes trying to save his son from? What death does he hand out where Carl fears him? Thats where Rick is heading with all his lets shoot first, ask questions later attitude hes got going on. 

This is just my opinion. I really am interested in discussion on this. I feel like there's a LOT of bloodlust going on in the subreddit. I think that's focusing on the smaller picture. And I think for humanity's sake ... (which is why I think it's nice that they talk about Art in some of the episodes) .... it's nice to have the big picture in mind, when you think of other people as humans and not as "not one of us".  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We did sled pushes and tire flips. And I have never flipped a tire. And I'm like ... ho lee crap, this is going to be fun. 

We tire flipped to a certain location and then sprinted to a sled and pushed it to another location. The first one or two times were okay. But man, that third, fourth time with the sled, my legs felt like lead. After I pushed the sled to the endpoint, my heart realized what just happened to it and started racing. And I am out of breath trying to walk all cool and calm and collected back to the starting position for my final round. 

It looked so playful on the board is all I'm sayin.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In a lot of the side poses like triangle or extended side angle or half-moon I see people get cramps in that lower hip. what is a good modification or a good cue to prevent this or alleviate it? 

 I tend to see this in older men. The crampees immediately come out of the pose (and they'll usually hit their hip with their fist...so I'm guessing it's a cramp) and I feel so bad!! I obviously don't want to hurt anybody. But on the other hand, I feel like these are pretty standard poses, and I see this so little that I don't want to omit the poses either. Halp

<TEXT> I was just watching The Affair. And (I dont think ruins anything for The Affair, it's just a plot point) Noah's father-in-law basically runs Noah's family by financially supporting Noahs family. So Noah can get told how to raise his family bc his in-laws have been their financial backbone while Noah writes books. And I'm sure this leads Noah to not "feel like a man" ... erego, the affair that he has. 

So I'm watching this last episode, Redux, and it looks like the ambassador's husband is starting to really like this spy stuff he's been doing for the other side. It looked like he got enjoyment out of it. What do you guys think? Is he starting to stick it to his wife a little? Like a few episodes he was trying to get the hell out of dodge. And now he's encouraging his wife to stay at her job. 

I just think he got shamed out of his professorship. And then his wife seems to wear the pants in the family. . . . it's just a theme I havent seen played out in television recently.  Or at least I havent recognized it. 

edit: And in a weird way, it's like the guys do the kind of feminine things of subterfuge to get back at their spouse. So cheating (something sexual). Or spying (something crafty). These seem to be "feminine" things. Whereas a masculine thing might be to get into an argument or fisticuffs.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I saw this [goodreads post](https://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/469-what-s-the-it-book-of-2014) titled **What is the "It" book of 2014** and definitely wanted to hear reddit's opinion!. 


**The main players were:**

1. *We Were Liars*, E. Lockhart

2. *Landline*, Rainbow Rowell

3. *All the Light We Cannot See*, Anthony Doerr

4. *Big Little Lies*, Liane Moriarty

5. *The Invention of Wings*, Sue Monk Kidd


Goodreads limited their selection to releases from Jan - Sept (to reduce the bias for newer releases). So here are **more recent releases** that you might unfairly favor over the older releases: 

1. *The Bone Clocks*, David Mitchell

2. *Station Eleven*, Emily St. John Mandel

3. *The Paying Guests*, Sarah Waters

4. *I'll Give You The Sun*, Jandy Nelson 


**Previous "winners"**

2012 - Gone Girl 

2013 - Goldfinch? 




Please, no spoilers (or mark them appropriately). 


Do you agree with the nominees? Who is the winner? Any obvious books missing?

http://imgur.com/a/XbOh8

It's just showing that there might be a little nod in next week's episode to the first episode when Rick stumbles out of the hospital. 

In [the post](http://blondietvjunkie.tumblr.com/post/100558274377/1x01-5x04-the-rick-and-beth-parallels) where I found this, the commentor talks about how the clock is moving in next week's episode (suggesting maybe there's movement and power in the group) versus in 1x01, where time was still.  

I don't know if they do this stuff on purpose ... but I saw and wanted to share with yall! Don't dead open inside.

<TEXT> So throughout the day, especially when I'm driving and my mind is kinda blank, I'll find little notes of inspiration. Or better ways of telling scenes. And then I just pull out my iPhone and use the text to speech as a way to scribble down ideas, plot points, motivations, whatnot. 

I guess I'm having issues transferring them somewhere that will be useful to me later on when I get to that scene. They seem to clog up my outline. But my Notes are getting super long and out of order.

<TITLE> [NOTW] Plot question and motivation, Ch 82. [Spoilers] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-08 16:28:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Please no spoilers after ch. 82!!

I'm listening to the audiobook version of Kingkiller Chronicles (which is so good btw! The narrator is awesome). 

I started to get a little lost on why Kvothe left the arcanium (or the school he was at). 

1. Why did he leave the arcanium? It seems like there was $$ motivation. But he's not making any money (with the exception of the draccus scales and I guess some other poison or something they found at that abandoned fort/greystone rock place they were hiding). 

2. Can someone remind me how Denna came into the picture again during their current excursion? She's looking for her patron, but that seemed to get brought up AFTER Kvothe found her. Why was she injured?

3. What's the deal with the wedding? Why does Kvothe care? 

4. Did Kvothe think the Draccus's destruction was the Chandrian and then he was like ... crap, it's a Draccus. I guess I'll kill that since I'm already here and it's causing destruction. 

5. Ch82 specifically. Kvothe woke up all bandaged up. The innkeeper was like "you need to stay here" but Kvothe did something with "drab" and something melted ... this seemed to convince the innkeeper to let him go. What did Kvothe do? 


I've been following along pretty well until then. But this current storyline has me a bit confused about what's going on. 

Thank you guys! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Women taking a stab at directing horror films. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-05 02:45:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I grabbed an Entertainment Weekly magazine and they have a snippet on women directors of horror movies coming up this fall. Here are some of the points they made. 

* In the past 5 years, only 5% of studio releases had a woman director
* BUT THIS FALL! FIVE female directors are taking a stab at the "unladylike" genre of horror, including: *Honeymoon*/Leigh Janiak, starring Rose Leslie (GoT), cabin in the woods vacay goes wrong; *See No Evil 2*/Jen and Sylvia Soska, DVD release; *A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night*/Lily Amirpour, Elijah Wood is is an executive producer, described as a "vampire Western"; *The Babadook*/Jennifer Kent, children's book that comes to life. 
* Women make up 51% of the audience at horror films according to PosTrak
* Jennifer Kent told people about Babadook and said "Their faces would drop. It was like I was saying I was directing a porno." </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Discussion] [Spoilers] The Martian by Andy Weir, directed by Ridley Scott ... will it lose it's humorous edge? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-05 02:17:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I really liked the book. And I think it would do well adapted as a movie with its catastrophe after catastrophe tense plot. Ridley Scott directing this is a bit conflicting for me because I'm so used to Aliens, Promotheus. And those are just full of a dark, sinister, humorless world. And I thought Mark, the main character of The Martian, was pretty calm and optimistic about all the crap that happened to him.

I thought I'd get a better discussion here ... than in movies. I think Matt Damon is supposed to be Mark Watney. And there's talks of Jessica Chastain and Kristen Wiig (who, for the love of me, I cant figure out who'd she be cast as!) also starring. 


One last thing! i think the martian was also self-published? Which is awesome for self publishing. And I thought Scott was also affiliated with Hugh Howey's Silo series. So, yay for self-publishing.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Entertainment Weekly asked the actors "How do you want to die?" Here are their answers. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-02 00:45:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **Andrew Lincoln:** Maybe a kid should take me out. I texted Scott Gimple yesterday and said, "Promise me, when I die, on the credits sequence, you play Johnny Cash's version of "Hurt.'" And he said, "I can't make that promise." So when I die, even if Scott Gimple decides not to do it, please everybody [at home] play "Hurt."

**Lauren Cohan:** Maggie and Glenn are running through a forest, and there's a horde behind them, and there's nowhere else to go - just a cliff. They hold hands and jump off the cliff and scream all the way down. And it freeze-frames on them with their arms up in the air. 

**Norman Reedus:** If I had my druthers on how I would go, I would just walk away. You would just see me walk down a road like Mad Max and I'd get smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller, and then a little dog woudl run on the road with me and just start following me off into the sunset, and you'd never know what happened to him. 

**Chad Coleman [Tyreese]:** I know I would want it to be heroic. Sacrificing myself for the others would probably be the most compelling way to me. One of those "Everybody go! Just go!"

**Danai Gurira:** She's not going to go down without a pretty epic fight. That's how I see Michonne. That's what I want for her. 

**Michael Cudlitz [Abraham]:** As with everyone, I know it's coming. At some point everyone dies on TWD. I would hope that his death would be befitting of his life, and Abraham did everything hard. As they say in Spinal Tap, it goes to 11.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm finding as I write more and more stuff, I'm following this trend of Post, rough draft, edit, post, rough draft, edit. Which is all fine and good. But I find I stagger my chapters a bit so I dont get tunnel vision working on just one chapter. 

It looks something like: Post ch 1, write initial draft for ch 3, edit/revise ch 2, post ch 2, initial draft for ch 4, edit/revise ch 3, post ch 3, etc ... 

I think it helps break up the process. Since Im doing my final revisions on previous chapters while I'm about to post the next chapter, I think it helps me with continuity mistakes as well. 

I was just curious how other people write their fanfics. I follow some writing subreddits, but those people tend to write novels and are a bit more "serious" about things ...  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Homeland - watching the first season and just wanted to fangirl with some people ... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-03 23:41:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi, Someone lent me the Homeland DVDs and Im about 8 episodes in on the first season (so no spoilers please!) 

But watching some of the show reminds me of my job. I do chemistry stuff and we basically have to prove everything. Even when everyone's hunch is correct on the manufacturing floor ... it's like you gotta still prove it to convince to other people. So seeing Carrie struggle through that was something I could kind of connect with. And I have a "Sal" at work who kind of talks me through that so I can present a better case to management. 

Anyways, it was just a dumb thought I had but I wanted to share. 

Also, I have recently watched the first season of The Americans. And I found it easier to "get into" The Americans where Homeland took me a bit longer. But I really do prefer the season long story like Homeland has versus the (mainly) episode by episode plot of The Americans. 

Last thing: the show is really interesting to me because Carrie is nuts but in a realistic way. And I had heard so much buzz about the show but her character was not at all what I was expecting! I thought she was going to be smooth and calm and collected, but NOPE! Her character is really great. 

I cant wait to see how this season ends! </TEXT>

I was remember the 2012 election when Romney was like "Obama isnt a great supporter of Isreal" (loosely quoted) and how Obama ridiculed Romney for calling Russia a geopolitical threat ... 

And I wonder if US would have stated we were strong supporters of Israel from the get-go if some of this escalation would have happened. Its like the parents have turned their backs and now the kids are slapping each other. 

What is the conservative way to look at foreign policy these days? And what do liberals have to offer? It seems to be a mixed bag with neither party having a consistent platform.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> CrossFit (or whatever you like to do) is probably cheaper than a bad diet. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-04 05:57:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I dont know where the other thread went, but I tried to comment and it got deleted. 

This is probably super embarrassing. I spend SO MUCH on fast food. But maybe this might be interesting to some people (who don't EVER eat out) to understand how expensive it can be to eat out. 

For me, eating unhealthy costs a lot of money. 

On a typical day through the week, I will spend: 

*Breakfast: $11 for a coffee, sandwich, and cheesecake brownie at SBUX

*Lunch: $10-15 (sushi, Wendys salad and soda with fries, etc, you name it)

*Dinner: Skip or do some $7-$11 fast food deal. 

 And I've done a "where does your money go" on my checking account and my food/alcohol spending averages right at $700 PER MONTH (on just food!).  I spend most of it M-F when I go to work. 

I have to make changes with my diet because it's killing my pocketbook AND my physique. 

And I have changed my eating since June. I have stopped the morning coffee runs. And I'm buying grocery store food and actually preparing meals. So I'll see how the money works out this month! But I spent like $50 at the grocery store this week and I'm still eating off the food after 4 days. (When before, I'd probably be at around $100 already).  And just after these 4 days, I FEEL better. 

At this rate, I should have an extra $350 just in food savings alone. My membership at a CrossFit costs less than $150. 

TLDR: If you have a shitty diet full of fast food, you can probably afford CrossFit.

<TITLE> Can CrossFit HQ learn anything from yoga (Yoga Alliance)? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-04-20 03:11:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know that CrossFit and yoga are pretty different. But I was reading [this article](http://americanyogaschool.com/yoga-alliance-ruining-yoga/) and came across the following quote: 

There are great teachers out there. But they are great in spite of Yoga Alliance, not because of it. These skilled teachers pushed themselves, and their teachers pushed them, beyond the mild standard that Yoga Alliance created. We need a body that ensures that all yoga teachers are appropriately educated. 

and there's also this: 

Since 1999, minimum standards for yoga teacher training have been authored and administered by Yoga Alliance. According to Pam Weber, their Director of Credentialing, Yoga Alliance currently has about 40,000 yoga teachers and 3,000 yoga schools registered as being in compliance with their standards, far more than any other such organization. To the untrained eye, they seem to be the gold standard for yoga teacher training standards. But, the standard that they set for yoga teacher training is nowhere near adequate. And it's ending up with a lot of people getting hurt, and far more people walking away from their first yoga classes disappointed and wondering what all the hype is about.

How often do you hear something like that about CrossFit?! Well, William Broad of the New York Times has written quite a few articles on the dangers of yoga (and there's no weight involved in yoga .... so I am not surprised by the hate CrossFit gets). 

Instead of telling trainings what should be taught, Yoga Alliance simply requires that a certain number of hours be spent covering each of five areas of study, with no specificity given on how to fill those hours. As listed on their website, registered 200-hour trainings (the level that 85% of their registered yoga teachers hold) must include 100 hours of practice, 25 hours of teaching methodology, 20 hours of anatomy, 30 hours of philosophy and ethics, and 10 hours of practice teaching. But, the content of each area of study is left up to the school. As Weber explains, "How do you monitor such diverse populations? 

My friend's 200 hour yoga teacher training was like bootcamp whereas mine was more like group therapy (like seriously every week someone would cry). Huge differences between the studios and what they teach exist. There is no standard work on how to run a teacher training.  (Which reminds me of the workouts you get at boxes. This guy focuses more on strength, but these guys sure do a lot of metcons ...)

And thinking about how I got my 200 hour certification at a studio recognized by Yoga Alliance (and I'm sure that studio pays some money to YA every year to keep that ability to stamp my certificate with the Yoga Alliance logo), I have a hard time not thinking about boxes paying money to HQ to keep that "CrossFit" name on their box. 

I dont know if this will really impact anyone. But I think HQ could look to yoga and see what their organization could learn from it. 

The yoga postures came from India (just like the CrossFit movements have existed in some form or the other outside of CrossFit ... ). And I fear that CrossFit will just do what some of the more annoying figures in yoga history have done. Like Bikram Chodhuroy patented yoga postures (26 postures done in a specific temperature in a specific order but still.... kind of a dick move but he made a lot of money). And now yogaglo has also filed a patent on how to film a yoga class and that really created a lot of ire within the yoga community. 

Anyways, blah blah thanks for reading.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi,

Thank you guys so much for making this subreddit what it is. I really love seeing all the pics and advice here. 

The mods have received a few complaints about all the pic posts. Especially the "hey, look at my hair" ones. I dont really know how to stop these. And I personally don't know if I want to. All the other health and beauty subreddits seem to allow the "hey check me out" posts. And I dont want this to be a text only subreddit. 

But I know the pic posts can be super annoying and gratuitous. There's a fine line b/n showing your locks and karma whoring. 

Do you guys have any suggestions or input on this situation? 

Edit: thank you guys for all your comments and suggestions! We will keep everything the same. In the future, we might add some type of filters to hide link posts. Or we will can add a weekly/biweekly look at my hair posts. Again, thank you for contributing to our community! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm watching a movie called Tomorrow When the War Began and it reminded me of a trailer I saw about 2 or 3 years ago. 

It was just a trailer but I felt like the movie was about this attractive group of 20-somethings (around Jessica Biel's age? A little younger) running away from a military/government power. I cant recall there being any supernatural/mutant powers involved. I remember wanting to see the movie but I never heard about it after it got released. I also recall surburbia, guns, people hiding while getting shot at ... 

I felt like there were attractive people in it - like Jessica Biel and the actor who plays Captain America (but I doubt it bc the movie would have been more popular if it really had them in the movie)

Ugh, I hope that's enough. This is really bugging me! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like I would assume Serbian Film and things like that. 

But then I heard someone say that Hostel was torture porn. Along those lines, would Saw then be considered as torture porn?

Or is TP something that's different depending on who the watcher of the film is? Is there an agreed upon def'n of TP?

Sorry I'm on my cell so hopefully I make sense! </TEXT>

I personally feel like Agents of Shield got a lot better. I like that Skye isnt romantically involved with anyone right now (even though she seems the obvious choice). They're starting to introduce some other worldly elements. I am just curious if anyone that didnt like the show stuck with it and like it a lot better or is the show still a disappointment to you

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First off, I've never read the comic and my only experience with Arrow is just with the show! But why would Sara and Oliver show up to the Lance's place together when Laurel was there? 

I love Sara's character and I was not a huge fan of Laurel but, damn, that's cold. Like Sara just showed up in town and then she brings her sister's ex boyfriend to a family event? That's cold! Were we supposed to get upset with Laurel for reacting that way? I think that's really a valid reaction. So I'm not sure how I'm supposed to view Oliver and Sara and Laurel right now honestly. Because I have not really read the comics. But it came across like Laurel is really on her own right now emotionally. She seems to have pushed everyone away. And even when she's right, she's wrong ... pretty much ?

I know this is a little middle school-y but goddamn if that happened in real life shit would hit the fan. Anyways, [bonus fun gif from the episode](https://24.media.tumblr.com/8c64080d0a456e13323efaaebf6dd7e2/tumblr_n1u2s7smqa1tspgq4o1_500.gif).  Thanks for letting me rant a little bit ...

I've been buying a lot of crap on my Kindle so when I picked this book up, I had a hard time switching to a better writing style! The writing follows around thoughts a lot and retellings of the past. So that might not be everyone's cup of tea. And it's also a total downer. But it's gotten decent reviews.

<TEXT> So at my gym, we record our reps for each 20 seconds of work. After the workout, for the board, you record your LOWEST amount of reps during those 8 sets on the board. 

Example 

Person 1: 7-6-5-5-4-4-4-5 would record 4.  
Person 2: 12-10-8-5-5-3-0-2 would record 0. 

So Person 1 looks better on the board. However, Person 2 ended up doing more reps than Person 1. But, boy, they sured petered out at the end. 

I have always assumed the answer is "well, depends on what you're working on". But thought I'd put it out to the community anyways bc it has kind of bugged me. 

(Also, if you're on the t-shirt swap, I'm sending out the emails tomorrow! Got a bit busy today).

<TITLE> Gym T-Shirt Swap </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-27 16:38:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> From [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/1vw5qx/anyone_up_for_doing_a_gym_tshirt_swap/) there seemed to be bit of an interest in a gym t-shirt swap. 

I want to plan a gift exchange for a blog I have, so I thought this would be great prep for that! 

If you'd like to receive a shirt from another gym and are willing to ship out one from yours, email (theposhest at gmail dot com) me the following, and I will match you up with another redditor. Have the subject line include your Reddit username. 

Name: 

Reddit username: 

Address: EDIT: [OPTIONAL] - at least give me your state and/or country
 
T-shirt Size: (if you're a female, please request your size in a male size shirt as well ... some boxes might only carry just unisex). 

Extras but not required: 

- Can you ship to another country? Keeping in mind, this can be expensive. 

- Can you re-gift? Sometimes people don't follow through on their commitment. Would you be willing to send another shirt out to someone who sent a shirt out but did not receive one in the first place? Essentially, you would ship out two shirts but only receive one (if people do not hold up their end of the bargain, that is). 


I plan on having this one-for-one ...  you ship to the person who is shipping to you. But if you guys want this randomized, we can do that too (where it's a true gift exchange ... where you ship to someone and they ship to someone else). 


Upvote for visibility! 
You'll have until Feb 5th to submit  your name to me. I'll get your your name by Feb 8, 9th and we'd like to have everything shipped out by Feb 22nd? 

I can also set up a google doc and show which username is gifting to whom. Only the usernames will be posted on the Google document. 

What will I do with your information? 
I will have to email your address to your match. I don't use that gmail account for anything. I will delete the emails I receive for this gift swap in March. 

Again, you are making a commitment to ship out a shirt. Don't be a douche. Follow through. Thanks!

EDIT: Hi! I haven't forgot! I'm sending these out tonight.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know Lizzie Borden and Lifetime might not be catered to reddit's demographic BUT.... if any females are out there ... Lizzie Borden was fun to watch. I thought it was fairly graphic for a Lifetime movie. Flowers in the Attic got a lot of buzz but Heather Graham was horrible in it. Christina Ricci (and Clea Duvall) make Lizzie Borden a treat to watch. And the soundtrack is hilarious.

<TITLE> Question: female, casual crossfitter, has access to globo ... what do i do at the globo gym considering my goals? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-19 23:18:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A little more info 

I am about 50 lbs over my desired weight. I'm 5'10" about a size 14. 

I go to CrossFit 2 times a week. Ive been debating whether to go 3 times a week. 

I teach yoga and have access to a globo gym about two times a week. At my previous gyms I've belonged to, I had a real hard time limiting my workout routine and I'd be taking like 2 hours to work out. It's not something I want to do after already spending an hour there teaching yoga. But I would typically do a group fitness class and then spend another hour jumping from machine to machine lifting weights. 

Diet is bad but getting better. I am not the paleo type. If anything I'm more of a whole foods/not processed, minimal meat person. I will not do a diet that forbids things like beans. So paleo is not for me. 

Goals: I'd like to get better at pullups. Right now Im doing ring rows during the WODs. 
I'd also like to lose weight. 
I love lifting weight! So I would like to do that more than twice a week at CrossFit. 

Do any of you guys go to a globo and to CrossFit as well? 

Mine has access to C2 rowers, squat racks, free weights, etc. But no kettlebells, no olympic lifting (or anything using "momentum")

What type of workout do you do at the globo? Do you have any framework you could give me to do at the globo that wont take hours? 

Someone told me if I lift then do the treadmill or elliptical for 30-40 minutes that the cardio will kind of "work against" what I just did in the squat rack. 

But I typically do two lifts. Like Press and Squats. And then I'll jump rope or do sit ups or work on my pullups with the assisted machine. It just seems as if my "programming" makes no sense at the globo gym! </TEXT>

<TEXT> In addition I know what happens to Tris at the end (but that's really all I know about the 3rd). 

I liked the 1st book. But the 2nd one was really hard for me to get into. I think Tris is a really confusing character. 

She's supposed to be reliable and multi-factioned which would insinuate to me that she'd be smarter than your average bear. Egs, keeping things from Tobias while at the same time getting mad at Tobias for keeping things from her ... so stupid. 

And she just always seems to fall into some forced conflict by Veronica Roth (especially the arguments between Tris and Tobias. Also, I don't really get Tris' motivations for putting herself in danger all the time .... ). I just honestly don't get the character of Tris (like her motivations). 

Anyways, I thought this sub would be better to ask than the Divergent sub! 

Let me know your thoughts!

<TEXT> Hey, 

So my hair dryer died. I just need something that actually has some wattage, will last a bit, and has a diffuser (and my last hair dryer, the diffuser wouldnt screw on so I had to duct tape it onto the dryer!). I really just use the dryer to get my hair like 70% dry before I go to bed. Especially in the winter!

I did love my old one though! Vidal Sassoon - it looked a lot like [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Vidal-Sasson-VS505-1875W-Turbo/dp/B000PXYC6U/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8 qid=1388348967 sr=8-3 keywords=vidal+sassoon+dryer) but before I drop a whole $15 on a dryer, I thought I'd hear if there was an obvious better well known choice in the curly hair community! </TEXT>

So first off are they still in style? Secondly, if so, would it look okay on a taller girl that is 32 who is not plus size but not a rail thin either? And where could I get one that is still stylish but cheaper? 

Thanks for your help! I want one pretty bad. But I feel like they might be a bit trendy and I dont do trendy very well. 

I'm specifically talking about these types, [longer style from free people](http://www.freepeople.com/swagger-fur-vest/_/searchString/vest/QUERYID/529c1a038570a32bea000144/SEARCHPOSITION/6/CMCATEGORYID/683d4023-53f5-4900-b5ce-ecf465df31a9/STYLEID/29308053/productOptionIDs/F41043CA-B93C-4663-9E51-620B10B9F1F6) (I'd prefer longer because it might help cover up my thighs but I feel like the shorter ones might be easier to find).

I started a sub that was aimed for people with curly hair. And about a year later, we're at about 6k subscribers! 

Currently, I am looking for someone who can help jazz up the subreddit a bit as well as the reddit alien. 

As far as design abilities, I'm looking for CSS that is close to http://www.reddit.com/r/TrollXChromosomes/ but not as much as http://www.reddit.com/r/fancyfollicles

Also, we do have guys in this sub ... so I would like the design update to not look so feminine. Would like people who are interested in health, beauty, malefashionadvice/femalefashionadvice, etc

Bonus if you can help remove spam and be an active moderator. 

Thank you.

<TEXT> Hi. Growing up in the late 80s/early 90s, there was this one particular 'Beach Party' type movie playing on TBS or one of those channels all the time. 

All I got is that it happened at the beach. There was singing. And it seems like the mom and pop were the "famous" actors of that time. And they had teenagers with them (like their kids)? But all the Beach Party movies I've seen are where Avalon and Annette Funnicello are the stars and they don't have kids. I don't know if it was specifically Avalon and Funnicello in the movie either. I just had this impression that they used to be famous (by my mom). 

Since I've only seen one of many beach party movies, I am sure I'm describing them all. But I thought I'd take a stab at it anyways.

But this movie did make rounds in the late 80s early 90s on basic cable! So I feel like someone should know what Im talking about?! 

edit: and I think they TRAVELED to the beach. Like, they didn't live at the beach. but it was a vacation or something. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Suggestions for something to wear inside shoes so you don't have to wear socks. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-09-23 17:26:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi FFA!

Do you ladies have any suggestions on what to wear with shoes so they don't become smelly! I really like wearing flats. Those [small socks](http://www.aldoshoes.com/us/accessories/mens/socks/93321355-jamar/98) tend to slide off my heel while I'm wearing them; and the ones that don't are too high and they peek up on my heel or front of the shoe sometimes. 

I was wearing these from ALDO - http://www.aldoshoes.com/us/accessories/shoe-care/comfort-fit/56076573-471_072/0
However, they've been sliding forward and bunching up at the toes. Plus, the rubber on the bottom of the terry cloth stuck to my shoe and ripped the ALDO liner apart! And now I have rubber attached to my shoe sole now. But I really liked how I could wash the terry cloth insoles and my foot wouldn't slip. (The ALDO ppl told me to cut the terry cloth insole a little smaller than what I wore. I wonder if that caused the bunching up ... )

Anyways, I was just wondering what you ladies liked to use or if you had any suggestions of good alternatives. 
My major goals are to have some type of liner I can wash or throw away (so I can go sockless!). </TEXT>

<TEXT> It seems to me that the lineup scenarios typically include BJ *or* Gattis (unless Gattis is catching and we know that Fredi is going to keep McCann in for the most part). 

This lineup is golden right now. I'm sure we'll keep it the same til it cools off a little bit. 

But jeez. You're paying Upton $15 million. He got hot at the end of last season. He's *supposed* to be in the lineup. You'll still have Gattis for the bench. Call him up in those pinch hit situations ... 

What would you do? </TEXT>

<TITLE> [conversation] What benefit or purpose are you seeking with a 30 day water fast? Safe? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-07-11 04:54:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello, I'm a new subscriber to this subreddit, but I have read about and done quite a few fasts in my day. 

I'm seeing a lot of posts about 30 day water fasts. I am a huge fan of Dr. Joel Fuhrman and he has done a lot of amazing things with his medical fasts. But anything that's going to last a month long, he has that patient stay under supervision. 

I have always read that 1-3 days is a good enough length of time for water fasts. I have personally done a 7 day water fast. 

I'm just curious why someone would do a medically unsupervised 30 day water fast? Or maybe, what benefit are you getting for a 30 day water fast that you wouldnt get from a 3 day water fast or even a 7 day water fast? 

Maybe I'm confused on what a 30 day water fast consists of here (I've heard people say they are water fasting ... but find out they are actually eating or drinking calories. To me, that's not a water fast). But a 30 day water fast, woo, I've honestly never have heard anyone suggest that unless they were on the old pro-ana/mia websites. I have read absolutely zero literature on fasting that suggests 30 day water fasts (edit: this is false. I should have inserted "medically unsupervised"). Everything I've read suggests nothing longer than 7 days, max. Most suggest 3 days. If you do the month long "fasts", books I read suggest getting that 800 cals through juicing or fruit/veggies. 

I really am not trying to attack. (I do have preconceived notions if your answer is purely to "lose weight"). But I'm curious about other reasons (like religious or spiritual, etc). Also, if anyone has comments about "detoxing", I'm curious about what literature you've read. Or what influenced you to go the fasting route to detox. 

Anyways, hi.  </TEXT>

How about if it is a major character in the real storyline, but not so much one in your fan fiction?

So this ballet guy told me "If you cant do splits by the time you're 30, then you'll never be able to get into them"

I was not able to do a lot of flexibility things ... but with patience and consistency I've been able to move from not being able to touch the ground in a forward fold (at 19) to now being able to palm the ground at 32 years old. 

I was just wondering if anyone knows about the logistics of splits. And if they're possible to most people at most ages. Or do you age out of this one? Are some people's body's just not able to get into this one? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2013-06-17 16:11:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Last night I was wondering if the vamps got in a fight, who would win?

It seems as if the Vampire Diaries are younger (not only in the time they were turned ... but as in AGE). The oldest in Vampire Diaries is probably Klaus. From a wiki, he is from the 1400's. 

True Blood characters ... Eric Northman is 900 AD (and he isnt even the oldest). 

And it seems like the True Blood vamps are more brutal and they seem stronger and faster (prob due to HBO's effects budgets but whatevs).

However, I DO think the Vampire Diaries MIGHT be able to have an upper hand because they have the sun rings. If those rings didnt work on the type of vampires in the True Blood realm, I think the Vampire Diaries type of vampires would eventually win out. They are probably fast and strong enough to elude the True Blood guys at night. Enough to wait until day to pull the True Blood guys into the sunlight!

Sorry, things I think about in the off season. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, 

I dont know if this is the best subreddit to talk about this. 

But I have been going through this phase of eating right for a week. Then binging for a week. Then eating "normal" (for me, still overeating) for a week. And then starting the cycle over. Sometimes I skip one of these steps or the other, but it's pretty much the same.

And I guess it's frustrating because I just got out of a binge-fest after eating GREAT for a week. And I have an event this weekend. And I wondered where I could have been if I had kept at the correct diet for this week (instead of binging). That week I had eaten correctly, I had lost 3 lbs. It might have been water, but it was much appreciated dammit! And from this bad week, I've gained it all back! What if I had eaten correctly this week? Could I have been 5 lbs down?!

I can start eating well all the time. It's just the damn sticking with it! I never stick around to see what happens. 

But today is a new day! All I know to do is to keep trying. I'm not going to be like, "well eff it. I guess I'm just not meant to eat healthy." 
"What could have been?" I dont want to be asking myself this same question 2 weeks from now. I should BE who I want to be today. And not let a hasty decision ruin my efforts of getting to a cleaner diet. 

I can put action to things. I just have this pesky problem with the whole "dedication" part ...  </TEXT>

<TEXT> [A list of the archetypes](http://www.soulcraft.co/essays/the_12_common_archetypes.html)

I was reading through and realized that Caroline was probably The Caregiver. I think her drive to help other people is her main motivator. 

Was wondering if you guys had any thoughts about the Salvatores or any of the other characters (Bonnie, Elena, etc) ... Or if you think I'm wrong about Caroline, maybe she's something else.

<TEXT> Hello! First time poster here, so let me know if there's a better sub for this question. 

I'm writing a fight scene.
And it's reading a little bit (a lot of bit) like a tennis match. 

*She does this. 
He does that.
So then she does this.
He does that*

Everything is starting with the two people in the scene. I've tried to fix it: 

*Angrily, he does this.
Not appreciating the punch to the face, she does that.*

But, I'm just masking the problem, not fixing it.

The following are the sentences as they're currently written. I'm wondering if I need a comma to separate the clause at the end? The first one, i dont think I do since "as he turns to walk away" is not independent. 

"Out," Curt sharply replies as he turns to walk away.

This next one, I have no clue so I just stuck a comma in there.

I have about 24000 songs on my iTunes. I really have a hard time finding those old gems that I like bc there's so much "junk" in there. I guess from when I used to get music off the internet for free. 

Do you have any suggestions on how to reduce your music storage on your computer? 

Right now I'm scrolling through the artists and listening to songs. I'm just having a hard time getting rid of songs! Like, with Backstreet Boys, I don't actively listen to them, but what if I want one of their songs on a running playlist?! How do you make that final get rid of decision? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Hip is popping during squats. This has never happened before! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-04-16 17:34:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi ladies. 

I am trying to lose weight and typically do squats at the gym. But I wanted to add some more squats to my routine, so I thought I'd do air squats on my day off at home. 

So every time I'm at the bottom of a squat, the anterior of my right hip pops as I'm standing up! It's never happened before. It doesnt hurt. But I dont want to keep doing the air squats while that's going on, obviously. I've tried stretching before I do the air squats and that doesnt really seem to help. I've tried changing the angle of my toes. I've tried to push my knees out more at the bottom, I've tried to keep them right on top of my toes ... that doesnt help. 

This popping doesnt seem to happen when I lunge. 

And maybe popping isnt the right word. But it feels like there's a sinew in there that's like ... strumming across the front of my hip bone every time I stand up from a deep squat. And when I go back down it goes back in front of the front of the pelvis and as I stand up, it snaps over the front of the pelvis again. I dont know if that makes sense!

I'd feel silly going to the doctor about it. I feel fine. I was really wondering if anyone has experienced it before and if it's a temporary thing that goes away? 

edit: Thank you guys for all the responses. I'll lay low and see where I'm at in a week. I teach yoga so I will look into psoas/hip stretches! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry if this has been beaten into the ground but ... 

People get VERY up in arms (ha, punny) about suggesting id laws for voting. Or, god forbid, a background checks or mental capacity to vote tests ... 

So legally, what makes it okay to suggest this with guns? I know guns can kill people ... but a lot of things can kill people. We're not given a right to drive cars. Driving cars is a privilege (I think). But we are given a right to bear arms. 

I dont know, I guess I need an Explain like I'm 5 thread or something.

hope this makes sense.

<TEXT> I feel like a common criticism of CrossFit is that you will get injured, its unsafe, etc. 

And talking to some Level 1 Cert people, they bring up how CrossFit Lvl 1 teachers typically say stuff like, "Ppl get injured playing soccer, running, etc". 

So which is it? Is CrossFit unsafe? Or is being "an athlete" generally unsafe? Or some other interpretation? 

And for arguments sake, let's say you go to a "good box" with good trainers. </TEXT>

If so, do you know how Amazon eBooks on iPad compare to iBooks?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm about 3 weeks into No Poo and my hair doesnt look worse. So Im sticking with it more. I'd be interested to see what it does during the summer!

How I do it:
A large spoonful of baking soda with about 6 oz of water in [an applicator bottle like this](http://www.sallybeauty.com/Calibrated-Applicator-Bottle/SBS-305925,default,pd.html?cm_vc=SEARCH) to clean.
and all the no poo communities suggest some apple cider vinegar rinse. So I have that too. About 8oz water and 1/10th of it is the vinegar. My hair doesnt smell bad after using (and rinsing) with the vinegar solution. But I'm just not quite sure what the point of the vinegar really is. 

Anyways, when I workout my hair seems not so dirty but my scalp ... ugh! it could use a wash. So I like that baking soda get up bc I feel like I can clean my scalp but not strip my hair and make it dry again. 

I dont know if I'm making sense but I've had a few drinks :D

Also if you are interested in being a mod, dont be like ADD ME LOL and have no skillz. I really want a cute curly haired alien on the top left and I have NO CLUE how to do that.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Having a hard time keeping up a strength routine and losing weight simultaneously. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-12-15 05:30:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I need to drop about 20 lbs. I've gained weight from eating poorly but, at the same time, started doing deadlifts, squats, snatches,etc. This is anecdotal but I remember eating like some gnarly fast food one day and then that night, I broke my deadlift PR by 40 lbs. Eating more helps me lift more. 

Even when I would eat better and lift weights (like 3 weeks or so) I'd still gain weight.

But recently I've stopped lifting weight and my weight is starting to FINALLY come off. I'm 5'10" and a size 12. Average. But I am about 40 lbs heavier than I was when I graduated college. I'd like to lose some of that weight because I'm overweight right now. I can do cooler yoga sh*t when I drop weight. I honestly look better when I lose weight. I have a bad complexion and my skin tends to look better too. This isnt some body dysmorphia thing! 

There's this other girl that I lift weights with who is thin and who lifts weights and she is totally gaining strength but wearing the same clothes that she wore before she started lifting! 

It seems like if you arent lifting, you're a horrible fitness person or something. Like everyone is a strong proponent of having a lifting routine. But when I do, it's like I'm taking 1 step forward and 2 steps back away from my overall fitness goals. Being strong is just one aspect; I want to be a healthy size for me too! It's not about me getting skinny ... it's about not weighing more than guys my height; I dont think that's asking for much. And I would rather do yoga or run than mess with high rep/low weight. If I AM going to lift weight, I dont want to mess with 8 lb dumbbells; I want to lift a bar and move some EFFING WEIGHT AROUND, y'know!

I was just wondering if anyone had thoughts or suggestions. 

TLDR: When I lift weights, I gain weight or have a hard time losing. Now that I've stopped lifting, my weight is starting to come off. Is there a way to lift heavy weights and still lose weight? Or should I drop the weight and then add weightlifting back into my regiment?  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2012-11-11 22:50:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I got out of shape for about 4 years. 

I've gotten back into doing CrossFit. I love it! My box really focuses on lifting weights. We dont do a lot of the "metcon" type workouts. But I feel fitter. Last year I couldnt run a mile. A few weeks ago I ran a Ragnar type relay and was able to run my 3 and 4 mile legs with no running type training. I just showed up, was pumped up, and I did it!

But one thing that's a big bummer is that I keep gaining weight. I swear, after every period, I've gained 2 lbs and it never comes off. My pants are getting tighter and tighter.

Is there a way to "cut" while I'm lifting so much weight. I definitely have the weight to lose. I dont really want to stop lifting too much. My diet leaves a lot to be desired. Will cutting sugar and fixing my diet do most of it? I'm also 31 years old. So is this just what happens?  Am I going downhill already??l!!!

<TEXT> Hi! Awhile ago, my super conservative friend said jokingly, "God, I hope there's bad weather election day because liberals won't go out and vote." 

Do you think the weather will really effect one party more than the other?

Will this hurricane effect the vote? I mean, if there was an election right around Katrina time, that would have definitely influenced how many people even showed up to vote. 

Not meaning to be disrespectful or "wishing harm upon libs" ... so if you're reading it that way, I'm telling you that you're mistaken. Just wondering if there are official studies on this or what everyone's opinion is on weather and getting out the vote. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why are liberals so progressive and accepting of Islam but not Christianity or Mormons? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-09-20 00:34:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It seems like it's socially acceptable among liberals to mock Christians and Mormons (see wildly successful musical: Book of Mormon by Parker/Stone). It's fine. I get free speech and all that. (Hell, even I'd see Book of Mormon if I had the tix!)

But when it comes to Islam, it seems like there are different standards when it comes to speech. At least with the recent request of the White House asking YouTube to remove the video that allegedly sparked the Libyan riots that ended up with our ambassador (and three other people) getting murdered.

Here's the editorial that says this a lot better than I can! [Muslims, Mormons, and Liberals](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444450004578002010241044712.html) (wall street journal)

Why are liberals accepting of Islam but not Christianity? I just don't follow the logic. </TEXT>

Christie might be playing it safe if he wants to run for POTUS one day though. 

Newt, however, might come out swinging. I think he said some great stuff in the debates. I'm interested in what he's got to say. I just hope Calista isnt up there too much.

<TITLE> Just a few thoughts about how the campaigns are run and the leadership styles of Obama vs Romney </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-08-21 23:19:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Im trying to leave my house in 20 minutes so hopefully this makes some sense!

Leaks - Obama's Cabinet (or someone in his inner circle) has leaked information about Osama raid which resulted in a movie. Versus Romney's - very tight lipped about the VP. 

Cash - Obama's campaign is spending more than he's campaigning. Romney (there are legal reasons for this!) has not. I'd be interested on how they're spending their money.

Romney's cash advantage: http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79920.html?hp=r7_b1
Obama spent more than he made in July: http://www.theindychannel.com/politics/31371858/detail.html



Headquarters - Obama's campaign headquarters are in Chicago ... and they're having a hard time communicating with the West Wing (inefficient and bureaucratic ... trying to keep too many people happy). Havent heard too many complaints about Romney's camp and in-fighting. [source-ish - politico](http://www.politico.com/politico44/2012/08/politico-ebook-trouble-in-obamaland-132516.html)

VP pick - Biden vs Paul ... c'mon.


I just see how Rommey is running his campaign and it seems like a fairly robotic thing. Some slip-ups have happened with each but I think Romney's campaign, overall, seems to be more lean and drama-free than Obama's. 

(not specifically managing a campaign but I like how Romney made a comment against Akin versus Obama still backing Holder ... ?) 

This just further encourages me to think Romney is a better leader than Obama.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> ME: for my workouts, I casually do crossfit and yoga. I also sign up for 5k's quite a bit. I seem to be in this black hole of running.. I've averaged about a 10:45-11:00 pace per mile over the last 3 years.

I would like to get it down to a number that starts in that 9 minute range. I dont care how long it takes or anything. 

Is this a realistic goal? How would you go about it? I'm 31 if that matters at all.

It's like when I run I'm out there for 40 minutes and I'm working hard but I'm just not seeing any progress with my pace. </TEXT>

NOW they have it by pages. And you have to click next to get from post 1-10 to post 11-20, etc. And you can only rearrange the first 10 posts! After you hit next, it's like they're locked!

<TEXT> I dont know. Its like you can just say, "[insert someone from other party here] robbed someone at gunpoint!" and the media jumps on it. And if the politician ignores it, the media interprets it to your detriment. And if the politician answers it, you give people reasons to do those types of salacious claims in the future. Damned if you do, damned if you don't.

And then concerning Romney's taxes - I have no reason to doubt the fucker paid taxes. If he releases the taxes, we're just going to hear about Romney's "Rafalca"-type tax claims from the early 2000's for the next 3 months. I honestly think that was Harry Reid's motivation.

I just feel like there's starting to be this trend of "Obama isnt a US citizen!" "Romney hasnt paid taxes for 10 years!" People just saying shit. And then we talk about these dumb distractions instead of meaningful issues. 

That's all.

I listen to Boortz, Rush, Hannity (I actually am not a huge fan of his show but it's on when I get off work), Herman Cain, Eric Ericcson, and Savage.

I can really only listen to talk radio in small doses, but I tend to actively seek out Boortz (I'm from Atlanta) and Savage.  On the east coast, Boortz is on in the a.m. so he's my go-to in the a.m.

I just discovered that Dennis Miller has a radio show, so I need to check him out. I've tried to listen to Beck, but I just don't "get" his show.

I really LIKE Jamie Dupree though. He doesnt have a radio show but he's a great, unbiased reporter! </TEXT>

I don't understand what to look for in the movements for the different gymnastics events. 

Can someone give me an overall gist of what the judges take off points for in the floor routine, parallel bars (is that one?), uneven bars, rings, vault, balance beam, etc.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Do you have any advice regarding creepers? I could be over-reacting ...  </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-07-20 08:04:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm not sure where to post this but this seems as good as spot as any. I dont think guys in the generic fitness groups will get it. 

And this will probably be a long post. I think it'll help just typing it out.

MY GYM: Okay so I'm a crossfitter. I pay over $100/month to go to my "box". I know certain people have strong anti-Crossfit feelings but I love doing Crossfit. And I love this box especially. There are maybe 3 Crossfit boxes that I would probably actually drive to on a regular basis and I've already tried out one of the other ones (for over 2 years). This is my 2nd box and I LOVE the progamming and people that own it. Like, they invite some of us to concerts, we do local 5ks together, etc. So it's more than "just a gym" to me. (And Im not trying to whore out Crossfit. I LOVED my old globo gym - Crunch, I LOVED Crunch - when I went there in the 90's. LOVED. IT.)

WORK: I work for a manufacturing company. I work in the lab. And I have to walk through the warehouse area to do my job and go talk to other departments. The hierarchy looks a little like this (we're small): Owner, dept heads, managers (thats me), full-times, and when we're busy we bring anywhere from 1 to 40 temporary workers. So I NEVER talk to temps. I dont have any in the lab that's a temp (bc temps tend to be under-qualified for what I need them to do; I typically hire college grads). And I am not in the habit to talking to them because if I ask them to do something, that might contradict what THEIR manager told them. They come and go anyways so we hardly get most of their names.

THE CREEPER: So there's this one temp that is there maybe 1/3 of the time. And lets just be honest here for a second ... if he were within 10 years of my age and attractive, this wouldnt be a reddit post. The guys in the warehouse think he's a great worker (therefore, a great guy). But the girl in Shipping/Receiving (she's the only full-time female that works in the warehouse that sees the temps) ... she also says there's a creeper vibe about him.

Again I dont pay much attention to the temps. But if they say "hi" or something, I respond appropriately. So he's said hi to me off and on for over a year. When I walk by him, he will stop what he's doing (and it's a mfg company, stuff is flying at you), will stare at me until I look at him, then he'll wave. 

Like, a year ago, he struck up a 3 min convo with me and told me he owned a gym. I told him I taught yoga. And he was like - oh, you should teach for us. And I was like "I'm busy enough but thanks gotta go!" So last month, he tells me he has something for me (on the inside I'm like "fuck! what?"). It's a yoga shirt (definitely not new, has stains on it ...). I say thanks and take the shirt and go back to my office. 

So cut to today and I am done with Crossfit. One of the Crossfit trainers tells me this martial arts guy dropped by and told the trainer that he knew me. And I was like ... who do I know that does martial arts? I think of the guy I knew that did MMA but that wasnt him. And the Crossfit trainer tells me the guy was like "yeah, i just saw her shirt while she was walking by and thought I'd check out the place". And I had wore my Crossfit shirt to work last week! We chatted further and I found out IT WAS THAT TEMP FROM WORK.

Like, I am pretty good friends with the boss of the temp's manager (the head of manufacturing). And I can't even vent to the head of mfg because he might just DNR that temp (that means "do not return" .. the temp in essence will be fired). The temp is a good worker, he hasnt done anything wrong so I just dont want to risk it. The head of mfg is quick to DNR temps because they are so easy to replace. (but the head of mfg might think it's  hilarious and not take it seriously at all either).

But on the other hand, if that temp starts hanging out by my Crossfit gym, I WILL BE PISSED. It's at a pretty busy strip mall with a bar, coffee shop, etc. So it wouldnt be odd for him to chill out there (but I always hang out in that area ... and I've NEVER seen him there). And, OMG, if he joins the Crossfit gym, I will talk to the owner. I feel bad but I would have to go to another Crossfit gym! The box owner just opened up the Crossfit gym so I wouldnt want him to lose a new customer. But I want to have fun when I work out. There's only about 5-10 ppl working out at the gym at the same time. And we're all doing the same thing! I cant just avoid the guy if he joins.

I am sure  nothing will come of this, but Jesus seriously? Leave my Crossfit gym alone, creeper! I have to tell someone! I dont want to talk to the owner just yet (I'm sure if it came down to me or the creeper, he'd want me at the gym; i'm a loyal customer and I'm awesome). 

I dont know, thanks for reading if you got this far. Any Creeper experiences at the gym would be appreciated. Or advice! I like to have a plan. So I tend to map out possible things that are likely to happen and my possible reaction. Like a Choose Your Own Adventure.

TLDR: i wore my crossfit shirt to work last week. today this temporary employee at my job showed up at my crossfit gym (I was not there) asking about crossfit. he's kind of creepy (and this other girl at work has verified his creepiness). but i could be overreacting. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Another article on Mangold (350 lbs Olympic weightlifter).  </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-06-23 05:05:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just really liked some of the excerpts from this New York Times article: [Shes 350 Pounds and Olympics-Bound](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/magazine/shes-350-pounds-and-olympics-bound.html?_r=2 hp)! Sorry for the powerlifting randomness. My intention isnt really to talk about if she's healthy or not (I think there was a thread a week or so back where that came up) but if it happens, it happens. I can seeing it happen because there's just so much talk about size in this article.

But I'm really just intrigued about females in the powerlifting world.  Like, females in general don't like being "big". But there seems to be a lifting advantage if you're "bigger" in powerlifting. I just wonder how that effects women in powerlifting.

I have just met a female powerlifter (who has a great ass, btw and no one would think she's fat if you looked at her) and knowing her helps me feel more fearless around barbells. She goes to this gym that only has weights (maybe a rower or treadmill) - barbells, bumpers and racks/cages (I dont know what they're called). She works out in friend's garages. It's just totally bad-a!

Anyways here's some excerpts 

"When she squats, which she can do with 525 pounds on her shoulders, she looks almost wholly like an egg."

It's true ... serious lifters like that get ass to calves in squats.

"The whole sport of Olympic weight lifting in the United States is scruffy: no money, low participation; its our Jamaican bobsled team."


"Meanwhile, Mangold dangled from a chin-up bar to stretch her back. Id like to see the other 350-pound ladies try this, she said."


"Not all lifters are big, but the women who compete in the 75-kilo-plus category tend to be huge. Mangold enjoys this. I dont want to be small, she said. That would be awful. Nobody remembers the skinny girls name. Understandably, she would like to be known as an Athena, not a behemoth, so she makes a constant string of weight-lifting jokes. Have you seen my beach ball? Its about this big  raises arms into a circle around her head, flexing her biceps  and it went that way  swivels right hand and left foot, flexing triceps and calf."


[I guess the writer is talking about a snatch here]
"Shes just hoping for that feeling when the lift comes together, when her body goes down and the bar floats up. Its like peace, theres no struggle, Mangold said. Thats what were all searching for, that feeling of weightlessness."

(I found that last sentence kind of ironic-ish ... seeing how's she's bulked up to 350 lbs to attain a feeling of weightlessness.)

<TEXT> I personally am confused about what Obama expects to happen. You are going to not deport the young people. But are their parents' fair game? If so, that is retarded. I would think you'd rather keep a fam together than have one of the kids live in the USA while their parents get on a plane back to Mexico.

"This is not amnesty" 
You sure about that?

Anyways, I am one of those people that believe the USA should have sovereign borders. And if you sneak in here ... you gotta deal with the consequences. 

But it's our own fault. You can't have all that open, unprotected border and not expect illegal immigration to happen like it has. 
I remember reading something that Mexico has a fast growing economy (like on par with Brazil in terms of growth). Maybe we should go there for jobs ...  </TEXT>

I've never gone to the temple outside of doing temple baptisms. I'm just curious about what people's personal opinions are on the matter.

I guess I can't find the logic that allows someone who abuses their body with fast food and taking more than their fair share or food needs being allowed into the temple when people who drink coffee and tea are not allowed into the temple.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> What do you guys think about this Romney holding John Lauber down and cutting his hair off? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-05-10 23:48:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Washington Post article: Romney cut off John Lauber's hair. John Lauber was a "presumed homosexual"](http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mitt-romneys-prep-school-classmates-recall-pranks-but-also-troubling-incidents/2012/05/10/gIQA3WOKFU_story.html)

First off, if this actually happened, not cool.

I guess I have a few comments or questions. 

1. Was John Laubner ACTUALLY gay? In the article, they referred to him as "presumed homosexual". Does anyone know if he was actually gay? I feel like in r/news everyone is assuming Laubner WAS gay and saying it's a hate crime. 

2. I find it weird this story is breaking within a day of so of Obama coming out in favor of gay marriage (after his inept VP forced his hand on the issue). If Romney has been "running for president for 6 years", why has this story never come up before? According to the article, Laubner has been dead for 3 years so it's not like we can ask him.

3. I'm still not voting for Obama. I think that people who are extremely irate about this would not have voted for Romney in the first place. 


Just curious what you guys think or comments you may have about the situation.

edit: answer to my 1st question ... I heard on the radio that Lauber came out as homosexyal later in life.

Romney response to the story:I had no idea that this person might have been gay I participated in a lot of hijinks and pranks during high school and some may have gone too far. And for that I apologize. and  I dont remember that incident. I certainly dont believe that I thought the fellow was homosexual. That was the furthest thing from our minds back in the 1960s.

<TEXT> I bought some new running pants that are SUPER cute! I havent bought specifically marketed "running clothes" in a long time because my main workouts have been lifting weights or yoga.

But I did start running and I got some running pants. 

HOWEVER I wore them to lift weights and as I was squatting down to do cleans I had that realization that the last pair of running crops were totally see through. 

So I pulled a trainer aside (female) and asked her to follow me outside. She  checked my ass out during a deep squat. And they were not see through. Finished my cleans (95# if you're wondering). 

TLDR; thought my running crops were see through (like my other experiences with tight running pants). squat check. they werent. </TEXT>

For some reason Take Shelter reminded me of the feeling I got while watching Moon. I kind of liked Take Shelter a littel more even.

They arent really like each other plot-wise (I honestly cant remember what Moon was about) but I just remember having the same feeling while watching.

Take Shelter is a slow burn. 

If any of you guys have seen both and have comments on why I might make a connection b/n the two movies, I'd love to hear them! I have no clue why I think if you like Moon you should watch Take Shelter.

I see other people posting from other countries on here as well. So it's cool to see Crossfit start to spread beyond the US's borders!

<TEXT> I havent really run since high school and maybe a little bit of college. I'm 30 now.

I wanted to run but found I had no time. I have a hard enough time getting up early as it is and find my legs are jelly in the morning, so I dont run before I go to work. After work, I am teaching yoga or I go to Crossfit the other two days so I just dont have time. 

So I have started running during lunch. About 15 min travel time to and from the trail. About 30 min to run. And then there's the cleanup. Currenlty I have a rag and towel I hide in my office. And I brought soap. 

I dont know, am I doing it wrong? I feel like baby wipes wont take care of the issue during the humid summers in GA.

My hair can hold sweat well enough. I have curly hair that is usually up. Would you guys suggest a dry shampoo?

Or if you could post your work running routine, I'd like to hear it because I'm super interested in the "lives of runners". </TEXT>

I dont want any yogurt or milk either.

Also, I really am trying to remove processed food from my diet. So I'd prefer things to be "whole" foods. No juices, etc.

I was thinking things like carrots and hummus, I guess a premade sandwich (sometimes those dont keep in the fridge so well though ...)? 

Are any of you guys in similar situations? Do  you have any suggestions besides just apples and bananas and stuff? 

Thank you in advance! And if some of the whole foods, non processed stuff is too restrictive, just throw out suggestions! I'm really all ears.  </TEXT>

Why do liberals keep bringing her up?! That negative attention they bring upon her is really what's keeping her relevant.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The ice cream they make at the demo is different than the one in the Vitamix recipe book.

The Costco recipe looks something like this.

* 1 cup French Vanilla creamer (like a coffeemate liquid brand)

* 1/2 package of Instant Vanilla pudding (must be instant)

* 2 cups ice. If you use frozen fruit, then subtract that volume you use from the frozen ice. The ice should go over the 2 cup line a little bit. (so if you use 1 cup frozen strawberries, use 1 cup of ice).

* (optional) if you want to do the veggie trick, you can add a slice of cabbage and the equivalent of 3 baby carrots or something. 



And when they make it at Harry's, they use like a coconut cream instead of the French Vanilla Creamer. And they use whatever instant vanilla pudding they have at Harry's in lieu of the Costco brand.


This is super easy and I remember it being super yum.

<TEXT> I just got my first vitamix this weekend and am anxious to try it out! 

But just a side question: The Vitamix guy doing the demonstration at costco was making ice cream and he added like carrots and I am pretty sure the second ingredient was cabbage. He said those two added together complemented each other to result in a vanilla flavor. Is this a well known thing or did I hear him wrong? 

The ice cream tasted legit so who am I to argue? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2012-01-11 18:37:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> From The Atlantic.

Thus far, European media voices have also expressed a strong preference for Romney over the other contenders. Clemens Wergin, for example, writes for Die Welt that the results in Iowa "show how uncertain the conservative movement in America is of its own identity." Mitt Romney represents the "classic, pragmatic, business-oriented branch." Then there's the "Christian, archconservative" side represented by Rick Santorum. Ron Paul "stands for the anti-state, radical libertarian impulses of America and for many populist reflexes. At the same time he's the candidate from whom there is the most to fear."

So Europeans like Mitt Romney and seem scared of Ron Paul?

<TITLE> Romney taking flack for Bain capital and firing people? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-01-11 18:04:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A few thoughts on this: 

1. Businesses exist to make profit, right? Not to create jobs. As long as the business practices don't hurt the rights of others (like trading sub prime derivatives), what Romney did at Bain can be part of his record (and we can discuss that and talk about how many jobs he actually made - like, that I dont mind)... but I dont understand why CONSERVATIVES are knocking on him for making millions in the private sector. 

(Also: When he worked for the SLC Olympics ... he didnt take his salary there. Versus Newt Gingrich with his Fannie Mae connection).

2. I'd rather have Romney take risks with investors money than what Obama did with taxpayers money with Solyndra. 
Which leads me to a question: What the government did with taxpayers money and Solyndra ... was that the same thing that Romney's company did at Bain? I honestly don't know.

3. Firing people. I would like someone to reduce the size of government. Wouldnt that mean people are going to be fired?! I'm okay with that.

The only person that came to Romney's defense was Ron Paul. I dont know if this is a valid complaint against Romney among conservatives or if Newt and Santorum are grasping at straws. I'm interested in other [conservative] people's thoughts on this. </TEXT>

<TITLE> How would I go about finding my biological father if I've never met him and he lives in a different country? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-01-07 07:07:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I dont know if this is the appropriate subbreddit. BUTTT here goes.

In short, my biological father lives in the former Yugoslavia ... somewhere.

He came here on a green card or work visa. It expired and he had to go back home. But during his 1-2ish year stay in the US, he impregnated my mom with me! (When mom got pregnant with me, she was actually dating this US guy in the Air Force. The AF guy had a vasectomy and he knew the baby wasnt his. They got a paternity test anyways and found out for sure that I wasnt his. He stayed around till mom had me though. And signed my birth certificate. But left shortly after that.) 
(You are NOT the father)


All I know is that my biological father was in the USA when my mom got pregnant. I know his first and last name. And I have a book and an old letter written in Serbian or whatever he speaks. Someone kind of translated it but the letter wasnt written to me. It was written to someone else and he mentions knowledge of me. And he mentioned some other kids of his (I found out about this letter when I was like ... 14, and Im under the impression they are younger than me).  

My mom is getting older and cant really fill in too much for me. I have a book about a city called Ljubjiana (this is from memory ... I just moved so I dont know where the book actually is right now). And it had an address taped inside but I couldn't find the address on google maps or anything. But found something that sounded almost like it in Slovenia. But mom has always told me they lived in Serbia. 

Mom and I have always been a little too worried about my stepdad's feelings to really pursue getting in contact with my biological father (my stepdad raised me since I was 4). But now I'm 30 years old .... I mean, if not now, when?!

So if  you guys could give me some starting points. Can I talk to some embassy and explain and see if they could pull some immigration records? Or what? I have no clue where to really start. I tried to google his name but his last name is fairly common and I doubt a 50, 60 year old guy from the former Yugoslavia has a strong internet presence. 

Sidenote: My biological dad's roommate used to live in the US and probably still does. My mom was good friends with his American wife. But they've been divorced for a long time and my mom hasnt talked to them in over 20 years. 

Anyways, yes! Help me out!! Or send me to another subbreddit. Or something. What could I do? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Falcons - Saints Christmas Poem </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-12-27 02:59:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Twas the night after Christmas, when all through the Dome

Not a Falcon was stirring, as the game wasnt Home

The team had flown down to New Orleans to fight

Their most hated foe on a crisp Monday Night.


The fanbase was settled all snug in their seats

While Jon Gruden suckled on Sean Paytons teats

And Berman and TJ, Keyshawn and Cris

All picked the Saints in a one-sided diss


When out on the field a coin toss occurred

The Falcons had won, and did not defer

Mularkey began with a run up the middle

And like we expect, it gained not a diddle


Coach Mike Smiths hair was like new fallen snow

Contrasting quite sharply with his red face below

When, what to our wondering eyes should appear

But a play-action pass, received with a cheer


Into no huddle took Matt Ryan the team

An audible came: a route up the seam

Methodically up the field they came

And Wes Durham shouted and called them by name!


Now Roddy, now Turner, Now Tony Gonzalez!

On Jones! On Harry! On Matty and Jacquizz!

To the Red Zone they went! To the pylon the throw!

And a Julio touchdown completed the show.


As expected with Brees, the Saints were not fazed.

They took to the field, and our defense was razed.

To Graham a thirty-five yarder ensued

And fans held their heads, all hope subdued.


The gains came in bunches, the safeties were rocked

The Saints scored a touchdown, the Falcons were shocked

But Smitty was calm, with a sly knowing grin

A rivalry game is no easy win


So the offenses traded their blows with precision

And the defenses were bathed in their fandoms derision

At halftime the score stood tighter than most

17-14, with the edge to the Host


The third quarter came, and the Saints took the ball

But the Birds defense held and put up a wall

The Falcons no-huddle returned the field

And half-time adjustments the offense revealed


They shredded the corners, they marched on the line

The yards came in bunches, they scored in good time

The Saints fans stood slackjawed, their giddiness stomped

It seemed that the Saints wouldnt win in a romp


The game rambled on until three minutes remained

The Saints were down four, with 80 to gain

They started to march and all hope seemed to fade

The Saints would win, it was all a charade


And there on the thirty, some pressure applied

Drew Brees saw it coming, his feet went to slide

But Abrahams hand came down on his arm

Brees fumbled the ball! The Saints were appalled


Matty kneeled the ball three times in succession

While Saints fans went home to greet their depression

The Falcons had won! They never froze up!

Merry Christmas to all! The Falcons Rose Up.

<TITLE> NYTimes: "The Problem with Serving Sizes" - How would you ideally like to see serving sizes on packaged foods? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-12-22 19:27:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [The Problem with Serving Sizes](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/02/the-problem-with-serving-sizes/)

Another product that made the list of egregious offenders was cooking sprays, which list nutritional information based on ridiculously tiny serving sizes, the group said. One of the most popular, PAM, boasts zero calories and zero fat on the label of its original canola cooking spray. But that information refers to a spray lasting just a quarter of a second.

Thats just not the way people use them, Mr. Jacobson said. Its probably impossible to spray for a third of a second. We suggested six seconds might be kind of reasonable. A six-second spray, he said, has 50 calories and six grams of fat.

I think redoing the serving sizes would be helpful but it's kind of hard to legislate that.

But I was doing the calories for my soup today. And the soups come packaged in 2 separate containers (This is the Costco soups). And, this is going off my memory, but I eat about half of 1 of the containers per meal. And there are 3.75 servings in the whole product. So each container has 1.875 servings? And then I divide that by two and figure out I have about 0.94 servings ... It's a little ridiculous on the math there. Or I could be reading the serving sizes wrong and the servings are actually 3.75 PER container and not 3.75 servings per 2 containers (as it comes packaged in). Thinking about this and writing it out, I'm sure they mean there are 3.5 servings in each container and not mixed b/n both containers. Eff!

Anyways, I had this nightmare of a calorie calculation and then I ran across this NYTimes article and I thougth it might provoke interesting discussion

I know polls are "BS" but ... I can Newt losing to Obama 20 points.  Its going to all be about Newts baggage (And I hate to use that Restore Our Future word). 

Newt has Congress, the only thing with a lower approval rating than Obama, written all over him.

And I remember reading a nytimes article where you're going to have a family man, young attractive, black male versus an old, fat white guy.

But I would love to see an Obama, Newt debate. But curiousity isnt going to send my vote Newt's way. . . . 

I honestly think Newt wants more book deals or tenure somewhere. I dont know if he realized he could actually win the nomination! I think his wife Calista is totally unlikable! She's a mistress and she's rumored to be the reason the campaign staff quit en masse. 

I dont know! Convince me otherwise, reddit!

<DATE> 2011-12-12 18:57:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I have an older gentleman that comes to yoga. His doctor recommended him to try out yoga for his back. And his back is SO much better! 

But most of the times, when he does triangle, half moon, and sometimes even warrior III he'll come out of the pose because of his hip. And he comes out of it fairly fast ... like he'll be okay and then all of a sudden it's a cramp?  

What's going on here? I'm not a doctor. Im guessing I should avoid these poses when i see him? Or are there some modifications where we might introduce movement into his hips without hurting though? </TEXT>

If you dont have that experience but have some ideas, share those as well!

<TEXT> So latest news is Gingrich and Romney are the new frontrunners. And Cain, last I heard, has a woman claiming she had a 13 year affair with him coming on tv tonight. 

So I'm just wondering who the Evangelicals will more than likely vote for? Would they waste it on Bachmann? Santorum? Those guys have no chance of being elected in the general election (imho). I can see them throwing support behind Perry though. Or will they close their eyes as they press Romney the Mormon or Caingrich the adulterers in the voting booth? I dont really know because that's not the type of conservative I am (ie, Im not an Evangelical and hardly care about social conservative issues; however I do care about the integrity of the candidate Im voting for). Im just curious who those guys are throwing their political support behind!

<TEXT> This is about 7 chapters in but gives you a good idea of the main character.


"There's a lot of men and women out here like me, Constance. We've been through this war and we just look at things differently than other people our age. I mean, there are certain bars I don't hang in. The people, the conversations, they're too frivolous. I'm not gonna sit around and have drinks with people who are, you know, *ironic*. Being in a classroom, listening to some teacher theorizing, I can't do it. I also wasn't about to take a job in an office and deal with the politics. I woke up one day and knew that I was never gonna have a college degree or wear a tie to work. I was coming up on thirty years old and I realized, I've fallen through the cracks. But I'm luckier than some people I know. I've found something I like to do. My eyes open in the morning and I have purpose."

Constance pushed her plate, now holding only bones, to the side. "You're either the most complicated guy I ever met or the simplest."

"I'm the simplest."

"You're *smart*. You read a bunch. You should try school again."

"Not gonna happen," said Lucas. "Does that bother you?"

"No."

"But it will."

"Maybe." She reached across the table, put her hand over his, and squeezed it. "It doesn't bother me tonight."

Lucas signaled the waitress. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [HELP] What's preferable: eating late at night or not at all? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-09-30 04:14:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi. Sometimes I just dont end up getting home until after 7 or 8pm. I eat a pretty large breakfast and lunch because my schedule tends to get me home later. And I like eating light dinners anyways. 

Right now it's 10pm and I just got home at 9. I'm starving! Should I just go to bed and do better tomorrow? Or eat? 

I have about 20 lbs to lose and I would like to lose it. I tend to workout at night and have energy and am hydrated for those. So aside from the little pangs of hunger, I feel alright when I don't eat. And when I tend to eat at night, I wake up feeling (sorry if this is TMI) constipated and like the food just sat there. Even when I eat a large green salad (just greens, italian dressing and vinegar to extend the italian dressing. I can eat plain salads just fine) I feel bleh. And if I eat nuts, I feel gross in the a.m. ...

I have a feeling most people will suggest to eat something small. But I just feel like the food isnt doing anything beneficial if I eat something at 9, 10pm!

Should I eat this late at night or not worry about it? 
If I should eat, what can I eat where I don't feel gross in the morning.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Laurie Garvey hadn't been raised to believe in the rapture. She hadn't been raised to believe in much of anything, except the foolishness of belief itself.

We're agnostics, she sued to tell her kids, back when they were little and needed a way to define themselves to their Catholic and Jewish and Unitarian friends. We don't know if there's a God, and nobody else does, either. They might say they do, but they really don't.

The first time she'd heard about the Rapture, she was a freshman in college, taking a class called Intro to World Religions. The phenomenon the professor described seemed like a joke to her, hordes of Christians floating out of their clothes, rising up through the roofs of their houses and cars to meet Jesus in the sky, everyone else standing around with their mouths hanging open, wondering where all the good people had gone. The theology remained murky to her, even after she read the section on "Premillennial Dispensationalism" in her textbook, all that mumbo jumbo about Armageddon and the Antichrist and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. It felt like religious kitsch, as tacky as a black velvet painting, the kind of fantasy that appealed to people who ate too much fried food, spanked their kids, and had no problem with the theory that their loving God invented AIDS to punish the gays. Every once in a while, in the years that followed, she'd spot someone reading one of the Left Behind books in an airport or on a train, and feel a twinge of pity, and even a little bit of tenderness, for the poor sucker who had nothing better to read, and nothing else to do, except sit around dreaming about the end of the world. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First time doing kettlebell snatches. And I'm really awkward with my snatches and cleans because my elbows can not move in sync or they go too far out or I just dont have the rhythm down or something.

But we did this 10! workout (10, 9, 8 ... ) involving the KB snatches. And mine started out horrible. But during the 4th round, I  heard the crossfit trainer whisper to his partner, "you can see that she's getting better."  And it was true! I was wasting a lot of energy doing KB snatches incorrectly (plus, the kettlebell was slapping against my arm roughly bc I was gripping the kettlebell instead of letting my grip loose as I was transitioning the KB above my head). I dont know, it was just neat. I remember what the trainer told me wasnt really clicking ... but once I started and my muscles were like "WTF IS HAPPENING?!!" I was able to naturally find the better movement bc I was overthinking it during the warm up. 

Have you guys ever done a movement really inefficiently and corrected it mid-workout? What was the movement? 

Sorry this is a random, specific topic ....
I am not quite sure if I just over-think things or everyone has this problem </TEXT>

<TITLE> Taxing the extremely rich. I need some clarification. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-09-14 18:20:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am conservative but I am honestly not heavily invested in politics (I find it draining sometimes). I dont really know the current tax rate for the really rich or who qualifies as extremely rich. 

I am not really seeing what the bfd is about taxing the extremely rich. The CEO of the small business I work at ... is not extremely rich. I dont think he even hits that tip top of the tax bracket. I've been given the impression by the media that the extremely rich are given tax breaks. 

I just think that the refusal of taxing the extremely rich is kind of an odd thing for the Republican party to keep bringing up . . . . 

Does someone have a grasp on this issue? 

I think I still can be conservative and not give a f*ck about the extremely rich tbqh.  I get the wealth re-distribution arguments ... but I think taxing these really really rich guys isnt going to careen us on a path to socialism. Not taxing the too rich is more of a philosophical argument than a practical thing, in my opinion.  Again, the small business owners (the guy I work for) isnt mega-rich. I'm guessing it's these CEOs that own businesses who are headquartered in other countries to avoid taxes in the first place that we're talking about here.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is your stomach growling? That doesn't mean you should eat.  </TITLE>

<TEXT> I am a huge fan of Dr. Fuhrman who is a doctor/nutritionist who encourages a nutritarian lifestyle. Fuhrman suggests you eat a diet high in GOMBS [greens, onions, mushrooms, berries/beans, seeds (nuts)], and that's about it, if you're curious.

He says that most Americans have an addiction to food. Like if you drank coffee 6 times a day and then the next day you didnt drink coffee, you'd feel bad because you have an addiction to coffee and you're going through withdrawal.

Same with the American diet. When your stomach growls, you get headaches, you feel fatigue, weakness, nausea etc is all "pretend"/toxic hunger to Dr. Fuhrman.  

Real hunger is felt as a sensation in the throat. You have increased salivation and a heightened sense of taste.

He says that while you're digesting food and storing calories, you're in the anabolic phase. When you move into the catabolic phase (where you start breaking shit down), that's when the "toxic hunger" arises. It can cause discomfort ... especially if you have a bad diet in the first place. When you eat, you feel better ... but your body starts digesting again and the process starts all over again. 

I remember him mentioning something about how our brain uses up a LOT of energy.  And it's doesnt want us to break down muscle for energy. So it will cue us to eat again before this happens to an appreciable extent.

Do you guys have any thoughts about hunger? And when we actually need food? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I cannot seem to stop pressing the snooze in the am! I have had the same job for years. And when I started Id get to work at 8am. And now its a miracle to get there by 9. 

 I'd like to get in the habit of waking up earlier (like an hour earlier, at least). 

Last night I went to bed at 3am. Tonightts past midnight and I'm wide awake right now. I struggle to get out of the bed in the a.m. but at night, I'm NOT TIRED! I would think my body would BE sleepy at night if I'm not getting enough sleep or whatever . . . Grrrr. 

Has anyone been a notorious night owl and became a person who gets up bright and early? Tell me your secrets. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Amy Fisher on Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew. I need to process this. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-08-11 18:17:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was a little too young to get what the real deal was with when the whole Amy Fisher thing went down.  So I am having an odd time trying to process the show this season. 

The other celebrities (their families) calling her Budafucco Face killer or whatever ... Oh my gosh, it's like these adults are in high school! But, on the other hand, I don't really *get* how this shy, frail woman could have shot someone in the face.  When that went down, did Amy Fisher seek out this woman or was it an argument got out of control and Amy, being shy, sought other ways to solve the argument?

Either way, her life has to be hell.  Other people's judgments have sentenced her. On one hand, I feel bad bc she seems so frail its so unfair! But on the other hand she shot someone; do the crime put up with the consequence. Grow some balls, etc. That woman she shot prob still goes through her own struggles daily as a result of Amy's actions. 

So I'm just trying to figure out how to view her and the situation on the reality show. 

Does anyone else have anything comments on Amy Fisher? Have you tried to dissect her? </TEXT>

<TITLE> I think I did TMTS and have a forefoot injury </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-08-10 07:57:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was definitely a heel striker. Then I wanted to try minimalist shoe running. I started out about 1 mile a few days a week for a week or two with the new running style. Then I went on the trails and this deer was on the side of the trail and I was running a new style and the deer didnt run away the wind was in my hair and it was beautiful and I was beautiful and so I ended up running and I got like 2.5miles in and felt a pain on my right foot, b/n my toes and arch - on that flat part there.  And so I had to walk back. And what's done is done, I know I did too much too soon. 

I understand people here arent doctors. I get that. But I have never really had an injury like this in my foot (and I just turned 30). So I have this pain in my right forefoot (left foot feels fine). Walking, I can feel the discomfort but I don't feel like I'd exacerbate whatever is going on there by walking more or less.  When I push on my forefoot with my hands, it hurts more when I push on the *top* half of my foot and not so much the bottom of my foot. But when Im standing and things where I push off using the forefoot would probably make my foot hurt more (like in jumping vertical and running in the minimalist style). I dont know it just makes me nervous to try again because I don't want to further injure the foot. 

What type of injury might I have? Should I stay off the foot and rest it? Or will movement and weight help it get better faster? I am under the impression it's not going to just feel bad one day and the next day it will feel better. I think it's just going to casually morph into a not hurt as bad. But it's been about a week. Has anyone gone through this? Time frame for heal-age? </TEXT>
