**Michael Burry Predictions for 2017**

Michael Burrys predictions for 2017 are rather unpleasant. Unfortunately, they may also be right, because world events appear to be heading in exactly the direction Burry expects. Burry, who runs Scion Asset Management, LLC, says we can soon expect a global financial meltdown and World War 3.

Michael Burrys prediction for a stock market crash shouldnt surprise anyone. Burry is the physician turned hedge fund manager who managed to make millions for himself and his clients when most people were losing their shirts in 2008. </TEXT>

<TEXT> https://www.thestreet.com/story/14089685/1/5-things-you-must-know-before-the-market-opens-wednesday.html
1. -- U.S. stock futures were rising Wednesday after earnings from Morgan Stanley (MS)  topped analysts' forecasts.

The S P 500 fell 0.29% on Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.55%, and the Nasdaq fell 0.12%, after first-quarter earnings from Goldman Sachs (GS) came up short, and Johnson   Johnson's  (JNJ)  revenue missed forecasts.

European stocks traded mixed on Wednesday with shares in London off slightly. Gains were held down by the two-day advance of the pound, which has risen against a weaker U.S. dollar after U.K. Prime Minister Theresa called for an early national election in order to shore up her domestic political support as she prepares to begin negotiations with officials in Brussels over the country's exit from the European Union. </TEXT>

Here are five things you must know for Thursday, April 6:
1. -- U.S. stock futures were lower Thursday following a sudden turn down in Wednesday's trading after the Federal Reserve committed to further monetary tightening in 2017. Investors also were nervously anticipating the first meeting between Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

The S P 500 declined 0.31%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.20%, and the Nasdaq fell 0.58%. Stocks had rallied earlier Wednesday following very strong U.S. private payroll numbers from ADP. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So why do investors clamor for dividends? Why do market commentators write lectures decrying share buybacks? Because sometimes the stock price goes down after the buyback, and then they get all confused.

Assume, in the wake of purchasing in 5% of its shares at $40, Hewlett-Packard sees its shares fall to $16. It beyond any doubt looks as though H-P has squandered $24 on each share it purchased. Be that as it may, dumbfounding as this appears, there is no waste from the buyback. In the event that the organization had paid a $2 profit rather, then the shares would have fallen considerably more- - to $15.20. What you're taking a gander at is not squander but rather just a PC business that isn't doing admirably. 

Presently, about those charges. Individuals contributing through assessment conceded retirement records ought to be apathetic regarding whether they gather a 5% money profit or offer back 5% of shares. Individuals contributing through assessable records, however, ought to mind a ton. They're vastly improved off with buybacks. 

In the event that you gather $2,000 in a profit, the entire $2,000 is assessable. On the off chance that you gather $2,000 by offering offers, you pay assess just to the degree the stock has had a keep running up since you got it. On the off chance that you got into Apple at $410 and offer back 5 offers when it's at $400, your $2,000 payout is sans scot. </TEXT>

French centrist Emmanuel Macron's performance in a television debate raised expectations that he would win the presidential election over the far-right's Marine Le Pen, boosting sentiment across Europe, with shares edging up toward 15-month highs.

Global investors have been worried about increasing protectionism, following the Brexit vote and President Donald Trump's election. Last week, the G20 leaders dropped a pledge to keep global trade free and open.

11 Hours Ago | 01:41
Shares of Tesla have been hammered in the past few weeks, prompting Jim Cramer to turn to the charts to investigate if it could impact the rest of the automobile industry.

To gain further insight on what the charts predict, Cramer spoke with technician Bob Moreno who runs RightViewTrading.com and is a colleague of Cramer's at RealMoney.com.

Moreno's research found that the era of Tesla outperformance is likely coming to an end, while Ford and General Motors could be ready to break out above key levels.

If you want to get a good idea of where the stock market is going in 2017, it might be a good idea to see what the smart money is doing. In this case, its George Soros, the founder of the $4.5-billion Soros Fund Management LLC and the 23rd wealthiest person in the world. What is George Soros predicting for 2017?

Soros has a comprehensive understanding of the U.S. and global markets, and the U.S. economic outlook for 2017. Soros famously made $1.0 billion in a single day, back in 1992 when he bet against the British pound. So we know hes not afraid to make a big bet on something hes sure of, even if the prevailing wisdom suggests otherwise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/21/verizon-knocks-350m-off-yahoo-sale-after-data-breaches-now-valued-at-4-48b/
After the disclosure of two massive data breaches last year, today Yahoo and Verizon finally confirmed new terms for the sale of Yahoo to Verizon: Verizon will pay $350 million less than originally planned, working out to a price of $4.48 billion to acquire Yahoo.

The two have also agreed to share legal and regulatory liabilities after the massive data breach at Yahoo, which affected some 1.5 billion users across two hacks, one covering 500 million users revealed in September 2016, and another covering 1 billion users disclosed in December 2016. TechCrunch has also confirmed that any further Yahoo liability going forward will be assumed by Altaba, the newly branded holding company that will oversee the Yahoo stake in Alibaba after the sale of the rest of the assets to Verizon.

The deal is now expected to close in Q2 2016, the two companies said. Verizon also owns AOL, which owns TechCrunch. </TEXT>

After posting eight consecutive weeks of gains, the Viridian Cannabis Stock Index, which groups a majority of the most relevant securities in the marijuana space, experienced a reversal last week.

For the five days comprised between February 6 and February 10, inclusive, the Cannabis Stock Index lost 1.5 percent, marking the first weekly decline since the beginning of the year. In contrast, the four major market index ETFs, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF 
DIA
, the PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF) 
QQQ
, the SPDR S P 500 ETF Trust 
SPY
, and the iShares Russell 2000 Index (ETF) 
IWM
, all surged over the week.

In order to get a better picture of what happened, Benzinga reached out to Viridian Capital Advisors analyst Harrison Phillips, who is in charge of the Cannabis Stock Index weekly report. </TEXT>

<TEXT> http://searchengineland.com/how-google-ads-impact-bids-pricing-adwords-auctions-269153
Google and its sibling companies at Alphabet collectively bid on thousands of keywords in AdWords. That has been going on for years. The search giant has said its ad buying does not directly inflate pricing for other advertisers because advertisers are charged as if it wasnt bidding. However, thats not quite accurate.

Participating in its own ad auctions has long raised conflict of interest objections. A report from The Wall Street Journal last month put a spotlight on the practice again with some eye-popping stats and renewed our questions about how these ads affect other advertisers.

<TEXT> http://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-best-performing-dow-stock-135402470.html

Shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL) posted a new 52-week high on Friday that is just pennies short of its all-time high posted two years ago. A strong first fiscal quarter earnings report and speculation about the next round of products are driving the stock higher.

Even CEO Tim Cook's outspoken comments on President Trump's travel ban have not been enough to chill investors' enthusiasm for the stock. Shares have added about $16 to date in 2017, an increase of 14.07%.

In Apples most recent quarter, sales of its core products did well. Cook said:

We're thrilled to report that our holiday quarter results generated Apple's highest quarterly revenue ever, and broke multiple records along the way. We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac and Apple Watch. </TEXT>

Stock markets have mostly soared, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.03%  touching record closes and the S P 500 SPX, +0.06%  and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.11%  touching their own recently.

Warren Buffett purchased $12 billion of stock since Trump election victory

Billionaire investor Warren Buffett revealed he beefed up his stock portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway after Donald Trump's election win.
In an interview with talk show host Charlie Rose that aired Friday, Buffett said, "We've, net, bought $12 billion of common stocks since the election."

Buffett added it was "in large part" his decision.

The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate owned $102.5 billion of equities as of Sept. 30, excluding its stake in Kraft Heinz, according to a regulatory filing.

Stocks and Treasury yields jumped in the wake of Trump's victory, amid the prospects for looser regulations in certain sectors, lower tax rates and fiscal stimulus. The rally has waned recently as investors evaluated the president's executive order that barred entry of certain nationals into the U.S. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Short answer: $5.

Better answer: $500, and only AFTER you have built up your emergency savings.
"We really encourage people to have six months of savings first," says Yvette Butler, president of Capital One Investing. Once you have a few thousand in savings, then you can start investing.
The goal of investing is to make your money grow faster than it would in a typical bank account (especially since savings accounts barely spit out a little more than 0% interest now). But investing is risky. You can lose money, especially in the "short run."

<TEXT> **Stock Market and Housing**
	
The housing and stock markets are interconnected in multiple ways. Major home builders shares are traded in the stock market. Home improvement companies tied to home building also trade on the stock exchange. The housing sector dips deep into the economy as furniture manufacturers, plumbers, electricians, landscapers and more are all dependent on housing. Housing starts and the stock market are both leading indicators of economic activity.

**Consider the three areas below:**

1. Credit
2. Consumer Behavior
3. Competition

**Good**
The best thing that a moderate market dive could do for real estate is keep the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates on mortgages.

**Bad**
Low inventory and a healthy amount of buyers have created a sellers market in the U.S. real estate market for the past 6 months to a year.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The dollar recovered a little ground on Wednesday after recording its worst start to the year in three decades on concerns the United States was poised to ditch its two-decade-old "strong dollar" policy.

The greenback skidded 2.6 percent against a basket of major peers .DXY in January, its worst showing since 1987. It fell first on worries over signs of protectionism from U.S. President Donald Trump and then on mounting unease that the new administration is set on talking down the currency.

A senior trade adviser to the president, Peter Navarro, said on Tuesday that the euro was "grossly undervalued", sending the single currency soaring above $1.08 for the first time since early December EUR= and knocking the dollar index down almost 1 percent to a seven-week low.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Resident Evil 7 dethrones GTA 5 from the top of the UK all-format games chart, racking up nearly three quarters of its sales on PS4.

But it might not be all it's cracked up to be, because as UKIE points out, it's only the third best opening week for the Resident Evil series, behind Resident Evil 5 in number one.

"Resident Evil 5 launched on 360/PS3 in week 11, 2009 and the highpoint was reached because this was also the first time the franchise launched on a Microsoft platform," the latest UKIE press release explains.

<TEXT> Chinese President Xi Jinping offered a full-throated defense of economic globalization at a time of global uncertainty fueled by Britains decision to leave the European Union and the U.S. election victory of Donald Trump .

Some people blame economic globalization for the chaos in our world, Mr. Xi said in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Mr. Xi countered the notion, saying that neither the refugee crisis nor the international financial crisis were the product of such globalization. In particular, he said, the financial crisis was the consequence of excessive profit chasing and the grave failure of financial regulation.

<TEXT> I continue to believe that the electricity powering this turntable is the speculation surrounding the legalization of marijuana. Last year, the government promised the legal framework behind legalized marijuana and the recreational market that will follow. 2017 is now here, and that announcement from the government is now only months away.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> China's central bank launched spot checks on leading bitcoin exchanges in Beijing and Shanghai, ratcheting up pressure on potential capital outflows and knocking the price of the cryptocurrency down more than 12 percent against the dollar.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said its probe of bitcoin exchanges BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin was to look into a range of possible rule violations, including market manipulation, money laundering and unauthorized financing. It did not say if any violations had been found.

Chinese authorities have stepped up efforts to stem capital outflows and relieve pressure on the yuan. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-01-09 17:10:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The second half of 2016 will probably be remembered for its geopolitical shocks and uncertainty rather than as a period of benign economic data.

But to do so would be to only have half of the story.

According to Goldman Sachs' measures of economic activity, the last two quarters of 2016 were really pretty encouraging.

"If you look at economic data for the past few months, there's been an impressive acceleration in growth," Jan Hatzius, the chief economist at Goldman Sachs, said in a speech in London on Monday.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> LONDON: Stock markets flattened Thursday and the dollar lost support as investors gave a lukewarm response to the Federal Reserve's signal that US interest rates may rise faster than expected.

US central bankers on Wednesday hinted that they may need to raise interest rates more rapidly than planned owing to "considerable uncertainty" linked to US President-elect Donald Trump's fiscal stimulus plans that risks fanning inflation.

This was according to minutes of the final 2016 policy meeting in December at which the US central bank lifted rates.

<TEXT> Its that time of year when financial advice sites issue their lists of the Stocks to Buy for 2017.

Apparently, Facebook claimed it could not reliably match user accounts between WhatsApp and its marquee service. This was in 2014, at the height of the merger. But then, two years later, the company began to combine user data in ways it said was impossible.

<TEXT> Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected sales would decline in November to a 5.54 million annual pace. Octobers sales pace was revised down to 5.57 million from an earlier estimate of 5.60 million.

Sales last month were up 15.4% compared with the same month a year earlier. The annual gain was exaggerated by a one-off plunge in sales during November 2015 that the NAR had blamed on new federal mortgages rules delaying closings. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Should you buy apple stock](	http://www.profitconfidential.com/analysis/should-you-invest-in-apple-stock/)?Revenue dropped 15%, but at $42.4 billion, the company managed to keep its revenue above the expected $42.1 billion thanks to higher-than-expected iPhone sales. As for iPhones in particular, the company sold 40.4 million units, which beat expectations of 39.9 million units.
But is Apples stock a Buy now and what is the Apple stock forecast? Apple stock in 2016 will remain volatile. Investors want to believe in a comeback and they are apparently willing to forego reality checks. They were willing to muster a bullish response even as Apple saleswhen it comes down to itsimply proved they were dropping.Yes, Apple also said that the iPhone is still able to draw customers into the companys stores. Indeed, Apple suggested that iPhone sales have finally reached a bottom. Yet iPhone sales in key markets like China dropped by 33% amid growing competition with local brands.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Palo Alto Networks Inc (NYSE:PANW) fell one percent on Monday as an analyst note reiterated an Outperform rating but lowered the price target.
This isnt exactly terrible news for Palo Alto Networks stock, as the company still maintained a positive outlook going forward, but the note from FBN Securities' Shebly Seyrafi, which pegged the price target to $155.00 from $170.00, certainly will give some investors pause

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It has felt like a very long wait for Doctor Who fans. The Time Lord took 2016 as an extended holiday, meaning its been almost a year since he graced our screens and was last seen enjoying the worlds longest date night with his wife (Alex Kingston) in 2015s Christmas special, The Husbands of River Song. 

But it wouldnt be Christmas without Doctor Who, so, in a superhero-themed festive episode, Peter Capaldi will return as the time-travelling alien.

Weve known from reviewing so many systems over the years that laptops almost never reach those estimated goals, even under a mixed load. Poor results also came as no surprise to us  Apple cut the batteries in the new MacBook Pros down by half in the 15-inch version, and by a third in the smaller 13-inch model. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For a start, races are far shorter than traditional Formula 1 race at 50 minutes in length. The cars  limited to a top speed of 140 mph  can run for between 20 and 25 minutes at race speeds before their 28 kilowatt-hour lithium-ion batteries run flat, necessitating a car-swap mid-race. And while the high-spec motors in each car can produce a theoretical peak power of 200 kilowatts, drivers must stay below 170 kilowatts during the race (unless they have been awarded the equally controversial Fanboost facility via social-media voting ahead of the race). </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Aphria Inc (CVE:APH) stock did it again as it just registered another large move, closing the day up seven percent.
I should not be surprised that there is still life in Aphria stock because the bullish premise remains intact. Every day that passes means we are one day closer to legalization. The madness and mania that surrounds this sector is set to continue until that day finally arrives.

<TITLE> Aphria Inc: Making Heads or Tails of APH Stock </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-23 11:25:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The bonanza and intrigue behind the marijuana producers continues, and the volatility has reached mind-numbing levels. Aphria Inc (CVE:APH) was the first producer to report positive cash flows as well as constrictive quarters of positive earnings. This is no small feat for a company that is only allowed to sell its product to medical marijuana patients.
Imagine the possibilities that recreational marijuana can do to the bottom line of a company that is already running in an efficient profitable manner. Under this premise, the profit potential for APH stock is stratospheric.

<TEXT> **The Top Emerging Tech Stocks**
Many investors might be wondering where to put their money. The markets bounced back promptly, setting record highs. The NASDAQ 100, which consists of about 100 companies (many of which are in the technology sector), rose by about five percent in 2016. But this does not mean there have not been big movers in the technology space.[Emerging tech stocks](http://www.profitconfidential.com/stocks/what-are-the-best-emerging-tech-stocks-to-buy-in-2017/) have both lost and gained. Over the past year, the S P 500 North American Technology Sector Index has risen about six percent.

<DATE> 2016-09-30 15:20:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For the third quarter it was all information technology, as the big names -- Apple, Alphabet, Intel, Microsoft (MSFT) -- all posted double-digit gains.  And Amazon, which is not a tech issue but has it as a key element of its business, is up 15.9% for the quarter," S P analyst Howard Silverblatt told IBD, with one session still left in the quarter.

Apple's stock was up 17.3% in Q3 as of Thursday's close and 6.6% for the year. Apple stock has bounced back on views iPhone 7 demand could surpass low expectations, but it's still mediocre in the ratings, with a so-so Composite Rating of 56 and equally mediocre Relative Strength Rating of 65.

Especially small kids...it is a very serious issue that kids tend to get involved in the things they experience on a regular basis...i knew a kid who used to be a part of a theatre group and she was playing the role of a daughter of a couple...in reality she was staying away from her father as her parents were divorced...she belonged to a very poor family...after some days of rehearsal she started feeling as if the couple were her real parents...she felt that all the situations in the play were real...she was so mentally disturbed that she cried and made life hell for the cast when they were going to replace the person playing the character of her father....any way my point is that this affects the minds of young boys and girls..is it in any way possible that such things can happen due to the oculus? any tests / precautions you guys have taken to avoid this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> However, Li-Fi may not be the go-to internet provider for most people due to its reliance on visible light. The technology website points out that visible light cannot travel through walls, giving Wi-Fi a significant advantage for most home and office consumers. Many people are also concerned with the potential cost of constantly running LED lights to provide a consistent stream of internet, making mass use unlikely.

The idea of Li-Fi was first introduced in 2011 by German Physicist Herald Haas during a TED talk. A year later, he founded a company named pureLiFi to focus on new advancements in the sector.

Deepak Solanki, CEO of Velmenni, said that the technology could be available within four years. "Currently, we have designed a smart-lighting solution for an industrial environment where the data communication is done through light, he said. We are also doing a pilot project with a private client where we are setting up a Li-Fi network to access the Internet in their office space." </TEXT>

<TEXT> The light water reactor (LWR) is a type of thermal-neutron reactor that uses normal water, as opposed to heavy water, as both its coolant and neutron moderator  furthermore a solid form of fissile elements is used as fuel. Thermal-neutron reactors are the most common type of nuclear reactor, and light water reactors are the most common type of thermal-neutron reactor.

There are three varieties of light water reactors: the pressurized water reactor (PWR), the boiling water reactor (BWR), and (most designs of) the supercritical water reactor (SCWR).

The light water reactor produces heat by controlled nuclear fission. The reactor core consisting of fuel and control elements is enclosed by a water-filled steel pressure vessel. The heat generated by the fission heats the water which evaporates in the pressure vessel in a boiling water reactor but, in the pressurized water reactor, the steam evaporates in a steam generator of a secondary circuit. The steam energy is converted into rotary motion of the turbine to which a generator for the generation of electricity is connected. After flowing through the turbine, the steam condenses into water in the condenser and is recirculated to the pressure vessel or steam generator. The water required to cool the condenser is taken from a river and refed into the river in warmed condition or the heat is dissipated via a cooling tower into the atmosphere. </TEXT>

<TEXT> LEDs have a general life expectancy of 50 000 hrs. If you use your lights for 10 hours a day, this should be 13.7 yrs. If this is correct, then LEDs are definitely an investment, even the top of the range bulb would work out to cost 2.55GBP per year. Add that to the saving you would make on energy and youve got a very cost effective bulb!
However, there are times when, even high quality, LED products can last as little as a year. The problem with these can be attributed to a large number of things, here are a few main causes:
Heatsink
Designing a heatsink is a fine science. Some heatsinks do not have the correct amount of surface area, some do not take into consideration about the gaps between fins to enable air flow. Some have horizontal fins, when they are positioned vertically. The main design fault with the latter, being that heat rises. Rather than dispersing the heat away from the bulb, the heat coming from the lower fins heat the upper fins even more.
Capacitors
Most, standard, electronic capacitors are made from a plastic. These have an average life time of around 1 year, if used regularly. Capacitors are part of the circuit in every LED driver. Now a number of companies are making their capacitors from ceramics, giving them a much longer life expectancy.
Environment
LEDs are usually designed to work in our country, and in our climate. If they are used in a hot country, or enclosed area, the heat around them can easily surpass the heat they were designed to withstand, shortening their life time.
To get LEDs to their full potential, these factors, among other considerations, must be taken into account. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. For one, he was the general who keeps on winning. And in any war effort, winning battles will always make you look good. And Napoleon won A-LOT! He pretty much goes undefeated up until Russia (Battle of Trafalgar doesn't count, caz Napoleon didn't direct that battle, which frankly I hope he did, and the loss in spain is the same situation, once Napoleon was in, they all got beat up). So he is the very definition of war hero up until the end of his military career. This is one of the main reason why he is the hero fo French, 

2. Secondly he was a revolutionary, and more importantly he isn't a pure revolutionary like the Jacobin, he does what he does to please the French people, and only the french people. For example he allows the nobles and the church state back in France after he was crowned emperor, but they have no power and right over the rest of the people. And this flies well with the French people who despite pushed out Church's, were still in heart Catholic. 

3. He was not only a hero to French, he was a hero to Italians, he was hero to Egyptians, and he was somewhat a hero to Poland. He freed the italians stats from Austria whom at the time ruled Italy with iron hand. Napoleon drove Austrians away and he ordered his soldiers not to plunder and pillage.which in itself is a heck lot better than Austrian army did. He eliminated the Holy Roman Empire and helped germanic states to built the Federation of the Ryen (I think that's how you spell it :P) allow them to have their own version of liberal and essentially made Germany. 

4. He was a hero to the government because during his time as general, his campaign kept government financially stable (somewhat, those guys really suck at economy). When royalists tried to overtook the french revolutionary government. Napoleon lead 6000 men, against 30000 I believe, and defended the government and drove away the royalist, essentially saved everyone on the council. </TEXT>
