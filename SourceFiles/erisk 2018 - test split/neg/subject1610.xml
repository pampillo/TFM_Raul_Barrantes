[*Fumbling is heard. A male voice speaks. Research has identified the speaker as MARTIN HENDERS. Caucasian male. Date of Birth: 09/29/1968. Date of Death: 02/17/2011*]

**MARTIN:** All right, this is... February 17th, 2011. Daily report: people coming and going. The usual. I could hear the couple in 31 yelling again. And then, of course, the make-up period comes around, when the yelling becomes a whole different sound, if you know what I mean.

[*Shuffling of papers is heard.*]

**MARTIN**: Mail came. More credit offers for that pile... two more magazines for that pile, which is getting big... and the newspaper, which Ill file away as soon as Im done reading it. Im probably going to move the newspapers into the kitchen. The stacks are too big. Groceries came late, again, which Im fine with-- Actually, there was something, this morning. There was an ambulance outside, at like five in the morning, and they bought someone down from the fourth floor. And he was yelling. Like, *really* yelling. So... maybe just a lunatic. No shortage of those. But thats it.

[*Recording ends.*]

***

[*Recording begins.*]

**MARTIN:** This is... February 17th, again. This is the first time Ive done two reports the same day in a long time, but Ive got a good reason. That lunatic from this morning? Looks like he wasnt the only one. I can hear people walking around upstairs. You can hear that, right?

[*Footsteps and creaking floorboards can be heard. Multiple sources. Muffled voices are heard, unintelligible.*]

**MARTIN:** The police are up there, because the guy in 57, apparently... *attacked*? One of his neighbors. And theyre trying to get him out of his apartment right now, but he just keeps... *yelling* at em. But not like hes arguing with them. He keeps yelling the *same thing*, over, and over, and over. The same words. Like its the only thing he can think of, you know?

[*The footsteps grow louder.*]

**MARTIN:** There we go, theyre bringing him down. You can hear them on the stairs. They got him quiet.

[*The sound of rain against glass can be heard. Researcher believes Martin has moved to the window.*]

**MARTIN:** Theyre bringing him out; I can see them. The guy looks like a mess. He looks... he almost looks sad. Except hes yelling again. Hes trying to get the cops to understand him, and... its not working, it looks like. They dont really know what to make of him. And hes getting angry. Theyre-- Holy... Theyre drawing their g--

[*Four gunshots. Martin is silent. Only the rain can be heard.*]

**MARTIN:** Jesus They-- They shot him. He... He grabbed one of the cops guns, and he tried to use it on them, and they... shot him down. Jesus. What the hell was wrong with him?

[*Recording ends.*]

***

[*Recording begins again. Shuffling.*]

**MARTIN:** This is still February 17th, and this is where it gets interesting. The police are going around to every apartment, and theyre putting a notice on every single door. And on the walls. And probably in the elevator and the lobby, too. But whats strange to me, is that they didnt knock on the door to deliver it in person. Youd think if it was an important issue, if it was a safety issue or something, theyd go door-to-door and tell everyone, right? Theyd explain it. But theyre not saying a word. Theyre just posting this on all the doors. *Silently*. And I asked them. When they came to mine, I opened it, and I asked them whats going on. They didnt say anything. They didnt even want to look at me. They were *scared*.

[*Rustling paper.*]

**MARTIN:** And now Im not sure what to think, because listen to this. This is the notice theyre putting up. This building is now under quarantine. Two cases have been reported, but more are likely to follow. In each case, the progression is the same. First, the subject will become confused and disoriented. Next, the subject will attempt to communicate with others. Finally, when the subject is unable to communicate, he/she will become angry and often violent. The subject must be silenced before he/she can...

[*Martin pauses.*]

**MARTIN:** ...before he/she can *successfully communicate* with others. Avoid all interaction and communication. No talking. No speech. No gestures. No written communication. No sign language. Any communication of any kind in any amount is dangerous. The building will be sealed until the virus is contained. What virus? What does a virus have to do with... talking?

[*Uneven footsteps are heard, as if one foot is dragging behind. The footsteps grow louder.*]

**MARTIN:** Hello?

[*The footsteps stop.*]

[*The footsteps continue, growing quieter, before fading away.*]

**MARTIN:** What the hell is going on? How is this a virus? This is... Ive gotta have something about this. Im... Im checking the stacks. Theres got to be some reference to this, and if there is, then, you know, Ive got it. Thats, uh... Thats what I do. I collect. So Im gonna research. Anything I find, Ill report back. 

[*Shuffling. The recording ends.*]

***

[*Recording begins. Martin returns, with energy in his voice.*]

**MARTIN:** This is *not* the first time this has happened. Im telling you, I am the best hoarder in the world. Ive got all the newspapers, all categorized and sorted out, and I can go back year by year, and search by topic. And I did. I looked for quarantines. And outbreaks. And a lot of it is, you know, bird flu, or whatever the health scare of the week is. But, every now and then, theres a quarantine like this one, *where they dont say what the cause is*. But there are some details that keep showing up, in every case. It always starts with a domestic dispute, or an argument, or a fight between neighbors or family members. One person turns violent... and then more people turn violent. Its always someone trying to communicate, and they *cant*. And they *snap*. And wherever they are, if theyre in an apartment building, or an office building, or anything -- the whole place goes to hell. So you know what? Maybe I had the right idea, staying inside here. Your, your lovable recluse is sitting in the right spot, you know?

[*Rustling of papers.*]

**MARTIN:** But then look at the dates for these stories. These quarantines. One in 1971, another in 1979, 1989, 1995, 1997, 1998. *And then they stop*. And thats the weirdest thing about it. Just as they were starting to get more common, the whole pattern just stops. So... I gotta go further. I gotta look online for this one, cause... this is nothing Ive seen. And Ive seen a lot. So, Im gonna keep looking; Ill be back. 

[*Recording ends.*]

***

[*Recording begins.*]

**MARTIN:** All right, this took some digging. The first thing I looked for was talking virus. And what I found was that these things didnt end in the 90s. Two incidents like this in 2004, three in 2006, three in 2007... these things are getting more common. These incidents. And youd think that would mean more people talking about it online, right? But **nobodys** talking about it. Anywhere. Anytime they do talk about it, the posts are deleted, or the whole websites gone; every other page is a 404. Which means: *someone doesnt want people talking about this*. They dont want anyone talking about it, because talking about it is dangerous. Like it said on the note. Avoid communication. You cant even talk about it, or youre in danger. The *talking* virus.

[*Fumbling of the recorder. Martin speaks clearly and directly.*]

**MARTIN:** Its a *linguistic virus*. A virus that spreads through language. Its attached to a word, and once you say the word, or you hear it, or you even think it -- the virus gets ahold of you. It scrambles your brain, and your mind tries to get help, it tries to communicate the problem to other people, to help you - but you cant communicate anymore. Its-- I know this, Ive seen this before...

[*Rustling of papers. Researcher believes Martin is searching through personal materials, likely notes and medical journals.*]

**MARTIN:** Ive seen it, but not like this... There. This is it. Listen. Its called expressive aphasia: you cant produce language anymore, you cant form a sentence. I saw aphasia cases during my residency; its caused by a stroke, or by brain trauma -- not a virus. This is expressive aphasia in virus form, infecting the host through language, attached to a single word. And that kind of thing **doesnt exist**. Or it *shouldnt* exist.

[*Rustling of papers.]

**MARTIN:** It infects, it kills your brain, it means you cant communicate anymore, but your body is trying so hard to. And everything just boils over. You lash out. You attack other people for not understanding you. You get frustrated, you get violent. Its a virus that turns you against everyone else, and all it takes is one magic word. Its the same thing as... you, you do that thing where say a word too many times, and it starts to sound weird. Right? It sounds wrong, somehow. There it is. Semantic satiation: A psychological phenomenon in which repetition causes a word or phrase to temporarily lose meaning for the listener. Thats what this is. This virus thing. Its semantic satiation, *weaponized*. Times ten. And all it takes is the right word; a word that you just heard too many times, and it hits that limit. It takes on a new meaning, and the physiological effect is psychotic expressive aphasia. And all it needs is the right word. The magic word I

[*Martin pauses.*]

**MARTIN:** Ive probably got... every word ever written in this place... That means Ive got the magic word here somewhere, right? I mean, I have to, right? In a newspaper, or in a magazine, or one of the stacks. I dont think Im gonna... do any reading tonight. Or I guess I dont even have to. I dont even have to read it, I just have to hear it. I just have to think it. So then what's the magic word? You can't even figure it out; you can't warn people what not to say. You can't tell someone not to think of something. Like, Dont think about ice cream. Whats the first thing you think of? Ice cream. How do to stop yourself from *thinking*?

[*A loud noise is heard; violent knocking and kicking at Martins door.*]

**MARTIN:** Go away! Im not talking to you!

[*Muffled, garbled yelling can be heard, unintelligible. Researcher describes the sound as throaty and visceral, implying speaker has suffered massive facial injury. Speaker will be designated as INTRUDER.*]

**MARTIN:** Hold on, Im checking this out. The doors staying closed, thats for sure, but I gotta get a peek at this.

[*Footsteps, as Martin approaches the door. The Intruders knocking grows louder.*]

**MARTIN:** Jesus Christ... His... jaw is just... *hanging there*.

[*The Intruder yells. The Intruders perceived injury renders his speech indecipherable, but Researcher does note that the Intruder appears to be yelling the same phrase in repetition. *]

[*The Intruder rattles the door.*]

**MARTIN:** Im not talking to you! I dont care what you want. 

[*The Intruder rattles the door harder.*]

[*Martins footsteps are heard, followed by the sound of a drawer opening.*]

**MARTIN:** I said Im not talking to you. You dont step away from my door, Im gonna shoot you right through it.

[*A click is heard. Researcher identifies the sound as the hammer of a small revolver.*]

[*The Intruder delivers one final kick, before leaving Martins door. The same uneasy footsteps are heard  one foot dragging.*]

**MARTIN:** Im staying inside. If they want me to avoid talking with people, they found the right guy. Whatever this is, Im sitting it out. Until... I dont know. Until something. Ill be here.

[*Recording ends.*]

***

[*Recording begins.*]

**MARTIN:** You can hear that, right? 

[*Muffled thumps and rumbles can be heard.*]

**MARTIN:** Its people fighting. And its hard to make out, because its coming from upstairs... *and* its coming from downstairs. People are tearing each other apart. 

[*Rain against glass is again heard, as Martin approaches the window.*]

**MARTIN:** There are a lot more people outside. A lot of them have guns, in case anyone comes out. Theyre not gonna give anyone a chance: if anyone goes out and just yells one word... its all over.

[*Loud thumps in the background.*]

**MARTIN:** The people running it-- Its not the police anymore. Its not even the FBI, or the CDC. Its something Ive never heard of; its these people called the Daumont Group. They just swept in and took control. They keep looking at the building. They keep pointing to the corners of the building. Trying to figure out a plan, I guess. So thats, um... Thats it for today. Nothings gonna change here. 

[*Recording ends.*]

***

[*Recording begins. Martins voice is noticeably solemn.*]

**MARTIN:** I know... I know I said that was the last one for the day, but... Im pretty sure thisll be the last one. Ever.

[*Martin sighs.*]

**MARTIN:** The Daumont Group, the people in charge, in all their wisdom: they got on the megaphone, and they tried to address the whole building. And they explained it. How they regretted that it came to this, how they wish that there was another option... but that the decision had been made, and the only way to keep everyone else safe, is to take the building down. With everyone inside it. 

[*Martin pauses.*]

**MARTIN:** And they said this, they said it loud enough for the whole building to hear it... and no one cried. No one reacted to it, inside the building. Nobody leaned their head out the window, and asked them for help, or asked them to find a different option. No one... No one did anything. They just kept killing each other. 

[*Muffled thuds are heard in the background*]

**MARTIN:** So thats it. They went around, they planted charges on the ground floor. And now, I can see out the window, everyones moving back, down the street. The rains finally stopping... Its a nice night.

[*Martin pauses.*]

**MARTIN:** And thisll be my last recording. And I guess my hope is that they find my tapes, and listen to them, and maybe itll help them figure out what happened here. Maybe theyll find that magic word. I hope they do. Were all in this together. 

[*Pause.*]

**MARTIN:** Together. 

[*Pause. Martins voice grows emotional.*]

**MARTIN:** *Together*. 

[*Pause. Martins voice grows forceful.*]

**MARTIN:** **Together**. Together. Together.

[*In the background, a male voice is heard; amplified, as if speaking through a megaphone. The voice is counting backwards from ten.*]

[*Martin speaks faster, straining.*]

**MARTIN:** Together. *Together*. Together. Togeth

[*An explosion is heard, followed by the roar of a structural collapse.*]

[*The recording ends.*]

**SUMMARY:**

Transcription of MA audio file KM-94. Date of transcription 07/13/2010. Researcher is [NAME WITHHELD].

-------------------------------------

**BEGIN TRANSCRIPTION**

[*The fumbling of a recorder is heard. The sound is muffled and choppy. The quality of the recording suggests an analog tape recorder.*]

[*The sound clears and a male voice is heard. Between 30-50 years old. American. Likely Caucasian. Amplified, as if speaking into a microphone. The male voice will be referred to in this transcription as SPEAKER.*]

**SPEAKER**: ...but few progressed as far, or caused as much damage, as this particular case. By March 21st, 1991, Robert Halpern, an electronics engineer from Richmond, Virginia, was fully convinced that his wife  was *not* his wife. Robert believed his wife Catherine was an impostor, identical in every way, but not the woman he married. He believed this Catherine had been sent to spy on him, gain his trust, and destroy him. And he could not be convinced otherwise. Next slide, please.

[*The CLICK of a carousel slide projector advancing.*]

[*A crowd of unknown size can be heard; an uneasy murmur.*]

**SPEAKER**: As you can see, the Halpern incident eventually reached a violent end. And, to fully understand what went wrong, it's necessary we start at the beginning. Next slide, please, let's get that off the screen.

[*The CLICK of a slide projector.*]

**SPEAKER**: Robert Halpern. Forty-three years old; electronics engineer within Bellmore Electronics; born and raised in Richmond, Virginia. No history of mental illness, none in his family [unintelligible]. Paid his taxes on time, enjoyed bowling on the weekends, and put ten percent of every paycheck in a savings account, to finance a vacation to Paris with his wife. Next slide, please.

[*CLICK*]

**SPEAKER**: Roberts wife, Catherine Halpern, worked as a paralegal at Hendricks-McKinley in downtown Richmond. Robert and Catherine were married nineteen years, very happily -- *until* Monday, March 11th, 1991 ... when Catherine laughed, while watching television. Robert had heard his wife laugh many times before, and he knew the sound very well; he had even mentioned it in his wedding vows. But to Robert, this particular laugh sounded *different*. And he could not explain why. 

[*The tape recorder fumbles, scrapes against fabric. Researcher believes the recorder is hidden on an individual.*]

**SPEAKER**: [unintelligible] only description that Robert could offer about this strange laugh was that it sounded like ... quote ... "a reproduction". Like someone trying to mimic his wife's laugh, and *almost* succeeding. Catherine noticed her husband staring at her. He smiled and looked away. But his thoughts persisted. Next slide, please.

[*CLICK*]

**SPEAKER**: No matter what, Robert could not move on from that one strange occurrence. The laugh that wasn't *her* laugh. Robert watched Catherine over the next few days, studying her behavior. He paid close attention to how she spoke. The words she used, the gestures she used. How she stood. How she walked. How she held a glass of water. And one by one, to Robert, the cracks began to show. Robert saw what he claimed were tiny changes in Catherine's behavior. Idiosyncrasies he had come to know very well, that were just *slightly* off. Invisible to anyone else, but her loving husband. Next slide, please. 

[*CLICK*]

**SPEAKER**: But Robert kept his suspicions to himself until the following week, when Robert joined Catherine for a dinner out with her parents and siblings. A warm, enjoyable family reunion for everyone except Robert, who heard his wife laugh again, and again, over the course of the dinner. The wrong laugh, every time. Until finally, Robert couldn't take it anymore, and asked Catherine a question loud enough for the entire restaurant to hear: *Who are you?*

Catherine, and her family, asked Robert what he meant, and Robert continued: *She's not the Catherine I married. I don't know who she is but she's not my Catherine.* The restaurant went silent, and Robert stormed out. Next slide, please. 

[*CLICK*]

**SPEAKER**: The next few days were as uneasy as one would expect. Robert and Catherine fought constantly, with Robert adamant that Catherine was *not* his wife. Finally, on Catherine's pleading, Robert agreed to see a therapist. In that session, Robert described his suspicions, and what he considered his evidence that Catherine had been replaced. The therapist had no success dissuading Robert, but his condition was identified. Next slide, please.

[*CLICK*]

**SPEAKER**: Robert was diagnosed with the Capgras delusion, a rare misidentification syndrome in which the subject believes their friends and/or family members have been removed and replaced with identical-looking impostors, or doubles. The Capgras delusion is most often a symptom of paranoid schizophrenia, though in this case it was not. The delusion is also commonly referred to as "Body Snatchers syndrome", after the 1956 movie that popularized it. Next slide, please.

[*CLICK*]

**SPEAKER**: The Capgras delusion was first diagnosed in 1923 by French psychiatrist Joseph Capgras, its namesake, whose patient, an unnamed woman, believed a *double* had taken the place of her husband. And thus the Capgras delusion was born. In the early 1950s, the delusion experienced a resurgence, which I'll return to later, but for now, back to Mr. Halpern. Next slide, please.

[*CLICK*]

**SPEAKER**: Even after the therapist's diagnosis, Robert's fears lingered. Robert was convinced he knew better, and ignored the therapist's advice, but Robert was smart enough to act natural, and avoid further unwelcome attention from who he perceived to be the *enemy* he shared a bed with. While pretending his suspicions had been allayed, Robert subtly "tested" his wife  asking questions about their past, their shared knowledge. Looking for inconsistencies. And Catherine, of course, answered every question correctly, but Robert was not satisfied. He grew distant from Catherine. He ate his meals quickly, making little eye contact. He smiled too much, to disguise his growing concerns. And he spent as much time as possible at work  but soon, Robert's suspicions followed him there. Next slide, please. 

[*CLICK*]

**SPEAKER**: At Bellmore Electronics, his company for the last seven years, Robert began seeing the same inconsistencies in his coworkers' behavior. As if they, too, were pretending to be someone they weren't. Robert's secretary was not his secretary. His colleagues were not his colleagues. His engineers were not his engineers. Robert's suspicions  his delusion, as his therapist would say  had spread. And it was at that point, that Robert recognized an important question: Why him? Why replace *his* wife, and *his* friends, and *his* coworkers with impostors? Why was he, Robert Halpern, *special*? Next slide, please.

[*CLICK*]

**SPEAKER**: Be it as a means to voice his concerns, address his condition, or simply to find a friend amongst a sea of enemies, Robert again visited the same therapist, who, luckily for us, recorded the conversation. This was the last time Robert would ever agree to visit a therapist, or a medical professional of any kind. It was the last time he trusted them. Roll tape, please. 

[*The Speaker pauses. An audio recording is heard, likely played over the rooms sound system. The tape recorder is unable to pick up any useable audio. Researcher does note that a second male voice can be heard. The voice is unintelligible, but is clearly speaking very fast, and with rising emotional intensity. The audio recording ends and the Speaker returns.*]

**SPEAKER**: Throughout his ordeal, Robert's refuge was his own journals, because while appearances, actions, and voices were untrustworthy, his own handwriting was a reliable constant. Robert knew his handwriting; he could recognize his handwriting, and he could recognize a forgery. Robert's detailed journal entries provide a better view of his mental state than anything else we've collected thus far.

[*The shuffling of papers can be heard.*]

**SPEAKER**: In an entry dated March 18th, 1991, Robert writes this: *Catherine is first replaced. Did she recruit coworkers? Hannah*-- meaning Hannah Gray, his secretary at Bellmore --*Hannah and Catherine are friends. Are they working together? Catherines family was surprised. Made a scene in the restaurant. Safety in numbers. If we hadnt been in public*-- and this part is underlined --*they would have taken me by now*.

Robert then lists a few of his coworkers at Bellmore Electronics: *Thompson, Cushing, Nakamoto, Ramirez, Grechi  replaced. Harrell, Fike, Detmer, DiSalvo  possible. Dineen, Shaw, Hopkins, Starkey  innocent.* 

Now compare that journal entry to one a week later, from March 26th, where Roberts handwriting is noticeably crooked, and he simply writes: *Everyone gone ... Cant trust work ... Cant trust home ... No one left.* Robert Halpern, despite being surrounded by familiar faces, was alone. Next slide, please.

[*CLICK*]

**SPEAKER**: But again, why him? Why was Robert Halpern special? The deeper he looked, the further he went, searching for a reason, the closer he came to a terrifying realization: that he *wasnt* special. That there was no reason why the impostors had chosen him -- they simply had. And, it may have been this revelation that finally pushed Robert over the edge. Because, as Robert realized, being targeted for a *specific* reason  was not as frightening as being targeted for *no* reason. There was no logic to dispute. No way to reason with an attacker, who had no reason for attacking. 

And, faced with an enemy he could not escape, Robert made the ultimate decision. On March 29th, 1991, Robert returned to Bellmore Electronics, took the elevator to the top floor and continued onto the roof, before stepping to the ledge, and addressing the people below. With what was described by witnesses as a calm voice, Robert said only seven words: *You win. Whoever you are, you win.* And with that, Robert stepped off the ledge, and fell seven stories to his death.

[*The Speaker pauses again. Researcher notes that the audience has become very quiet.*]

**SPEAKER**: Robert Halpern died believing his life had been infiltrated by impostors, by enemies, by conspirators. And he was absolutely right. Next slide, please.

[*CLICK*]

**SPEAKER**: Earlier, I mentioned that the Capgras delusion experienced a resurgence in the 1950s, but this isn't completely accurate. Because it was in the 1950s that -- for lack of a better description -- *the impostors arrived*. 

The first case appeared in upstate New York in August of 1951: Mary Cathcart, a retired schoolteacher, called the police, claiming her son was no longer her son. Mrs. Cathcarts worries were quickly dismissed - until more calls came in. An appliance salesman in Manhattan claimed his brother had been replaced. A construction worker in Jersey City believed his father was someone else. A postman in Philadelphia delivered mail to a family hed known for twenty years ... but was convinced that they were different people.

The Capgras delusion had ceased being a delusion, and had become the reality. This was not an isolated psychological disorder. Because five cases became ten. Ten became twenty. Twenty became a hundred. A hundred became five hundred. All across the country, unbound by demographic, geography, class, race. 

The impostors were spreading. And with them, rumors regarding their methods, their origins, their objective. What were they here for? What were they planning? Who was in charge? Who were they? *What* were they? Government spies? Guardian angels? Aliens? The public could only speculate. Lock their doors, hug their family, and hope that the person they were hugging wasn't one of them. 

In an effort to contain the panic, the U.S. government produced a series of films titled, The Enemy Next Door, to help its citizens identify and avoid these impostors, which were then affectionately termed, "the Strange Ones". Roll film, please.

[*The Speaker pauses. The rattle of a film projector is heard, followed by music and dialogue, but the audio is, again, unintelligible. Further study has found references to a 1951 Coronet instructional film titled The Enemy Next Door, but no copies of the film survive. Coronets own records were found to be heavily edited by an outside party.*]

**SPEAKER**: The message of this film is clear: suspect everyone, trust no one. 

But then, in early 1953, the panic disappeared overnight. The outbreak of impostors faded away just as quickly as it arrived, and within just a few months, the widespread phenomenon of the impostors was dismissed as Cold War paranoia, the fear of communism, mass hysteria, confirmation bias, etc. 

The incident was forgotten. And any further incidents in which an individual suspected their friends or family members, such as with Robert Halpern, were again diagnosed as a simple case of the Capgras delusion. Even if it **wasn't** a delusion. Next slide, please. 

[*CLICK*]

**SPEAKER**: But despite the sudden disappearance, the impostors never truly went away. They just got better at their jobs. And it was only with the Robert Halpern incident that the curtain was pulled back once again, for just a glimpse  but a glimpse that we cannot **ever** allow again. 

We cannot be so *sloppy*, we cannot be so *reckless* ever again. The Halpern incident was contained by the end, but the next may not be, and we cannot take that chance. Our operations depend on *absolute secrecy*. The Halpern operation fell apart due to something as simple as a *laugh*. We need to cover every detail, no matter how small, and in the future, if a target ever displays similar awareness of the operation, we will eliminate them immediately. Before they start yelling in the streets. Before it's the 1950s all over again. We are not beginners anymore, we are not amateurs. We are **better** than this. 

The Halpern incident is our worst-case scenario. And every one of you is here to ensure it doesn't happen again. You will be trained to infiltrate, to mimic, to perfectly assume a persona. To be *undetectable*. Because we have work to do. So, without further ado: welcome to the show.

[*Applause is heard. No cheers or yells; only what the Researcher would describe as disciplined agreement.*]

[*The size of the applause implies the room is very, very large.*]

[*The fumbling of a tape recorder is heard. The recording ends.*]

Have a question for both you guys; it applies to both writers and directors.

In each of your processes, is there a balance to be struck between authenticity (i.e. honoring your own personal vision) and commerciality (i.e. appealing to the highest number of people)? Can the two overlap, or are they miles apart? </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my opinion:

**1) The mix of conversational/colloquial phrasing and antiquated/articulate phrasing. A $10 word inside a $5 line.**

- *"I'm the Dude. So that's what you call me. You know, that or, uh, His Dudeness, or uh, Duder, or El Duderino if you're not into the whole brevity thing."*

- *"Also, Dude, chinaman is not the preferred nomenclature. Asian-American, please."*

- *"He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that."*

- *"Well, ain't this place a geographical oddity. Two weeks from everywhere!"*

**2) Unusual structure. They break up their dialogue with repetition, emphasis, pauses, and topic changes.**

- *"Also, let's not forget -- let's NOT forget, Dude -- that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city... that aint legal either."*

- *"Yes, you did. You've been putting it up your whole life, you just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin? 1958. It's been traveling twenty-two years to get here. And now it's here. And it's either heads or tails. And you have to say. Call it."*

**3) Fatalism and hopelessness. This is more thematic than stylistic, but Coen dialogue likes to make mention of larger things at play -- bigger schemes, cosmic plans, inescapable consequences. This is how the world is, and you can't fight it. The thrashing before futility.**

- *"You know how this is going to turn out, don't you? I think you do. So this is what I'll offer - you bring me the money and I'll let her go. Otherwise she's accountable, same as you. That's the best deal you're gonna get. I won't tell you you can save yourself, because you can't."*

- *"I gotta tell you, the life of the mind... There's no roadmap for that territory... And exploring it can be painful."*

- *"The Uncertainty Principle. It proves we can't ever really know... what's going on. So it shouldn't bother you. Not being able to figure anything out. Although you will be responsible for this on the mid-term."*

- *"Whatcha got ain't nothin new. This country's hard on people, you can't stop what's coming, it ain't all waiting on you. That's vanity."* </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Somewhere in the middle of a peaceful listless field

Should probably lead with that, rather than the snowflakes. Are the snowflakes important? Or, are they more important than the setting being a peaceful field?

 on top of a snow covered hill

Are we in a field, or on a hill?

 lies down a MAN with a piece of paper in his hand.

Omit the "down"; just "lies a MAN".

Also, what kind of piece of paper? A loose leaf sheet pulled from a notebook? A torn scrap? A pristine white 8x11? 

 Fascinated by the vivid snowflakes ascending, he stretches his arm to grab one. 

I'd reverse the order here and reword it: "He reaches up to grab one of the delicate snowflakes twirling through the air."

 The man is late-twenties, strong and blithe...

This should be right after the first mention of the MAN, a few lines earlier. Introductions/descriptions should follow the character's first appearance.

 It's made of glass and there's nothing on it. 

"There's nothing on it" seems a little awkward. So it's perfectly clear, unblemished glass? You could probably just say that: "...a perfect SPHERE the size of a fist, made of pure, clear glass."

 The sphere stands above his face.

Well... spheres don't stand. And the man is laying down, on his back. So is the sphere hovering right above him? Did it just come into existence above his face, or did it approach him?

 (A quarter beat)

Either it's beat or no beat; no need to bring fractions into this.

 INTO THE DARKNESS

That's a transition, but I'm not sure what's transitioning. Who's going into the darkness?

 The man finds his way to top [sic] of a hill

Wasn't he already at the top of a hill?

 The man finds his way to top of a hill radiating white bright light.

Weren't we going into the darkness? </TEXT>

<TEXT> You know what comedy on Reddit is like? It's like the end of *Murder on the Orient Express*. 

(Spoilers)

At the end of that story, we learn that the murder was not committed by one person, but by thirteen people: *"They took it into their own hands to serve as Cassetti's executioners... Each of the suspects stabbed Cassetti once, so that no one could know who delivered the fatal blow."*

And on Reddit, one person isn't guilty of killing the joke through overuse. **Everyone** is guilty, and the person who delivers the fatal blow may be using the joke for the first time. It's everyone's fault for having said it so much, not one person's fault. 

When it comes to driving a Reddit joke into the ground, the **group** is guilty, but the **individual** is innocent. The individual may very well be making that joke for the first time; it's the group that overused it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love the ending, because it shows the shortcomings in Vincent's approach. 

Vincent has spent the whole movie tightly controlling everything around him, wielding all the power, zeroed in on his goal. But then, in that [final shootout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMS4lYA-hEo) between Vincent and Max, there's a subway door between them. The middle of the door is metal, with windows on either side. 

And Vincent, because he's always been controlling, precise, and aiming for center mass, fires dead-on, straight for the middle -- and his bullets are blocked by the metal of the door. 

Meanwhile, Max, who was been unprepared and improvising throughout the whole movie, fires wildly and blindly -- and his bullets go through the windows, hitting Vincent, killing him.

You can see it [here](https://youtu.be/EMS4lYA-hEo?t=9s): Vincent's bullets dent the metal door in the middle, while Max's bullets shatter the windows on either side.

The script describes the moment like this: 

 "Max screaming, face lit only by the GUNFIRE, clumsy in how he holds Vincent's H+K, firing one-handed, not aiming, not looking where he's shooting...Vincent's Para-Ordnance BOOMING OUT MASSIVE ERUPTIONS OF FLAME..."

Improvisation beats control. Max kills Vincent. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thoughts:

- The opening bit sounds pretty obviously like a young guy faking an old man voice. 

- "We are a show that discusses the paranormal, conspiracies, the supernatural, UFOs, and anything else weird, from serial killers to cults." Why put "serial killers" and "cults" **after** the list of topics? It's like you're saying: "the paranormal, conspiracies, the supernatural, UFOs, etc... and serial killers and cults."

- (Also, "the paranormal" and "the supernatural" are basically the same thing.)

- The narrator's EMPHASIS is a bit EXAGGERATED, like he's getting PUNCHED in the STOMACH on EVERY other WORD.  

- The background drone sounds really cool.

- The promo definitely gets everything across, but as for funny? Not so much -- there's not really a chance to be funny, because it's all information. 

- I take it you're familiar with *The Outer Limits*, and that show's opening credits? Might as well learn from the best. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I suppose I'll start things off here, at the eleventh hour. 

*Archive 81* has a killer premise: it's succinct, it's dramatic, it poses an interesting mystery right here in the first episode. The atmosphere is outstanding, and the characters all feel different (something other audio dramas have struggled with)

But what it's not doing is building. Instead of **escalating** its story, *Archive 81* is **reiterating** its story. It is adding another strange element to the pile, rather than taking another step in the journey.

I read movie scripts for a living, and one of the most common problems I see is a story that's lingering on the starting line, reiterating its state of affairs, but neglecting to move forward. We know our characters, and we know their situations -- so what's next? These scripts drift for thirty or forty pages, before beginning the main story around the halfway point.

And unfortunately, *Archive 81* seems to be falling into the same trap. Six episodes in, it's still setting the stage.

It makes me think of *Limetown*, and why that podcast was such a success, and I think it's because each episode took a step forward: each new episode advanced the narrative it began with, and revealed more and more information **relevant to its core premise** (i.e. the vanishing town). And that's what *Archive 81* isn't quite doing: we can't tell how all this information is relevant, because it doesn't seem to be related to the core premise (i.e. Daniel's disappearance).

So when I hear Daniel talking with a rat, or when Melody questions a security guard, or when Carlos walks us through meditations, or when Melody tracks down an un-recordable man, or when an announcer describes Cassandra Wall's bizarre artifacts (the sound design in that chapter was incredible, by the way) -- I'm left wondering what this has to do with the core premise. Everything feels somewhat connected... but not connected enough. *Archive 81* is caught in a slightly uncomfortable middle ground between an anthology series and a serial narrative.

How does each new episode build upon the information from the previous episodes? How does the story advance, upon a path *that we can identify*? That's the important part: there may very well be master game plan here, but we can't see it, and we don't know it's there. And this means that the only story unity we'll ever feel, is one that we feel in *retrospect*, as we're **told** that all the previous stories were connected -- but they don't feel connected now. 

And I'm worried, because I like this podcast, but I have the feeling that *Archive 81* is painting itself into a corner by introducing more and more (seemingly) unrelated elements in each episode. And we have to remember all of them, because we don't know which elements are important and which aren't. We can't focus on the important stuff, because we can't tell what the important stuff is.

*Archive 81* isn't following one story; it's following twenty. And maybe all these stories will tie together in future episodes. But until then, it is -- as the title of the fourth episode explicitly states -- a collection of disparate strangeness. And that makes me... kinda nervous.

<TEXT> (Forgetting for a moment the fact that a modern remake of *Scarface* is currently in production-ish). 

Read a lot of scripts. It sounds like a dismissive answer, but it's really the best thing you could do. Pick a movie that you think *works* -- not just a movie you *like*. A movie that made you say, *Wow, this story comes together really well.* Then find the script for that movie and read it.

In addition to that, watch these three movies (and read the scripts for them): *Chinatown* (1974), *Superman* (1978), and *The King's Speech* (2010). Because all three of those movies run like clockwork.

Then, write up an outline for the movie you want to make. Make sure each scene leads into the next scene. Make sure the characters are active, and not reactive. What do the characters want, how can they get it, and what's standing in their way? 

Make the scenes dramatic, and remember: **Drama is a battle over power**. Maybe one character has the power and the other character/s try to take the power away, [like in this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4PE2hSqVnk), or [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7LsBMA-rKg), or [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lydYhl1982Y). Maybe the power distinctly transfers from one character to another, [like in this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFHYiOfBRng), or [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARJ8cAGm6JE).

Once you've got the outline written and finessed, download Celtx or WriterDuet (or Final Draft, if you can afford it) and translate that outline into script form. Match the formatting of some established scripts closely, because formatting matters: spacing, margins, how to write scene headings, how to use parentheticals. 

After the script is done, put it away for a few weeks, and then dust it off and read it. Revise it, based on what works and what doesn't work. 

And then do it all over again with your next idea.

And as for getting the script made... that's a whole different ballgame. </TEXT>

<TEXT> *The Black Tapes* podcast, because the premise is inherently flawed: exploring *video* tapes in an *audio* medium. 

And I know exactly what that podcast is trying to do. It's like they always say: the monster in your imagination is a thousand times more scary than any monster you could see. But since it's an audio podcast, we're **already** using our imagination to fill in the blanks, and relying so heavily on video footage (that we can't see) doesn't make it any deeper. 

All it does, is force us to wait until the video footage is over, and then Alex Reagan comes in and recaps what just happened on the footage that we didn't see. And that's not good storytelling. Being **told** the plot points in retrospect via disinterested/collected voiceover is not as engaging as watching (or hearing) them unfold in the moment. *The Black Tapes* podcast is not using the strengths of its medium (as opposed to, say, *Archive 81*, which does recognize the fact that it's an audio podcast -- although there are some issues with that one too). 

And then there's the format of the show. The model for each episode seems to be: something weird happens, Alex Reagan thinks it's weird, but then Strand offers an explanation, and the script ends on this anti-climactic ambiguous note. The weirdness is never confirmed or dismissed; it's just "Maybe so, maybe not". *The Black Tapes* never takes a stand (unlike, say, *The X-Files*), and constantly has to reset to square one, because it's too afraid to change its world and take a step forward. 

After listening to the whole first season, the culmination of those twelve episodes was just another maybe. *Maybe* all the tapes are connected, *maybe* Strand's wife is still alive, *maybe* there's an enemy approaching in the form of Thomas Warren. So way to go, *The Black Tapes*, you wrote an eight-hour first act. 

I could write a dissertation on the things *The Black Tapes* does wrong. It's got such a great idea, but the execution is falling apart. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Me personally:

- **Mood** -- That's what *Lore* is very good at: atmosphere, ambient music, etc. 

- **Get to the point** -- I like it when it's clear the episode has a direction. There was one episode of *Lore* that began with Aaron discussing his passion for the show *MacGyver*, and eventually the episode arrived at its true focus: goblins. But looking at those two topics, can you tell how one leads to the other? I was listening to the MacGyver talk and thinking, *What does this have to do with anything?* And if your audience is thinking that, then something's wrong. 

- **Have a story to tell** -- When the episode is just a string of facts, it's not terribly interesting, because it feels like someone reading a textbook. But if the episode unfolds like a story (i.e. question/conflict, escalation, climax, resolution), then I'm hooked. Two episodes of *99% Invisible* are the perfect example of this: "Structural Integrity" and "The Grand Dame of Broad Street". [*Lore* can't always accomplish this, because each episode is not just about one thing; it's about a lot of things.]

Or did you mean what kinds of topics? As long as there's a neat story to tell, I'll listen to anything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Burying the lead. 

I should really love the podcast *Lore* -- it's right up my alley. But Aaron Mahnke drapes the information in this theatrical language, focusing less on what's being said, and more on *how* it's being said. It sounds like narration from a movie trailer.

Take the episode descriptions, for example: 

*We spend every waking moment surrounded by people. People who talk to us, who interact with us, and who are very much alive an breathing. Which is why its that much more shocking when we stumble upon those who arent. And its more common than youd think.*

I have no idea what that episode is about.

More writing related:

- Horror movies need something to do -- you shouldn't just write a bunch of bumps in the night. If the haunted house/ghost/demon/slasher/etc demonstrates as much *influence* as an actual character, then it needs as much *drive* as an actual character. 

- I read a lot of scripts where the protagonist are given mountains of characterization in the first act -- but then once the monster arrives, all that characterization is abandoned in favor of the simple fight for survival. Why should I care that Jenny is flirting with Mike, or Rachel hates her new job, if it's not gonna matter once the killer shows up? Characterization isn't a placeholder, and protagonists aren't meat bags waiting to be stabbed.

<TEXT> I actually think *John Wick* fails the *show don't tell* advice, when it comes to John Wick himself. 

A lot of John's characterization comes from other people, who call him a badass. We're **told** he is an unstoppable killing machine, we're **told** he is the boogeyman, we're **told** about the mysterious, incredible things he did in the past -- but what we're **shown** in practice is (frankly) just an Action Hero. 

A very well-choreographed Action Hero, but still an Action Hero.

And there's one moment that defies that, and it's one of the best moments in the movie: Viggo hears John Wick is involved, says "Oh," and quickly hangs up. That one single action delivers a mountain of characterization. That moment says more about John, than all the boogeyman talk put together. That is showing, not telling. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  If you look at /u/subject1610's reader graphic, of the 300 or so scripts he covered that he used the stats from, 49 were horror. Less than half that many were drama.

I feel like I should point out that a lot of those 300 scripts were for a company that made a lot of horror films, and became associated with them, and probably sought them out. So the genre distribution may not be reflective of the industry as a whole.

John August and Craig Mazin were even surprised to see that the horror numbers were that high, when they reviewed that infographic on Scriptnotes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Script reader here. 

I honestly don't think there's one particular genre that's harder than the rest. I'm mentally running through the scripts I've read, and there are shitty scripts everywhere. There's no shortage of ways to mess up a story, no matter the genre. 

- **Horror** - Putting the horror above the story, and letting the plot gather dust while you cram all your jump scares in, killing off side characters and only approaching the protagonists in the last thirty pages.

- **Sci-fi** - Valuing originality of world over originality of characters/plot; adding as many sci-fi elements as you can without putting them to use in a story, and turning the script into a product showcase, rather a narrative.

- **Action** - Making your protagonists unstoppable, gruff, robotic Action Heroes who never miss a punch and never lose the upper hand; a script that is trying so hard to be *Badass!* that it's forgetting to make its story believable, engaging, or exciting. [The first version of *John Wick* I read had that problem in spades]

If I had to pick one, I might say comedies are hardest, because comedy is so subjective, and people's senses of humor are so different. Which means that you can do everything right -- but all it takes is a reader with a different sense of humor, and suddenly you've failed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's an interesting book on the subject: [The Great Beanie Baby Bubble](http://www.amazon.com/The-Great-Beanie-Baby-Bubble/dp/1591846021).

In summary: Beanie Babies were introduced at the Chicago Toy Fair but were largely ignored, aside from a few toy collectors. But then a fabric shortage for one of the original Beanie Babies meant it couldn't be produced anymore -- and, rather than simply discontinue that Beanie, the Ty company said "You know what, we're going to **retire** this Beanie." This introduced the idea of scarcity, which ignited interest. 

(Side note: Disney has been doing the same thing recently by saying "You'd better buy the Blu-Ray for *The Little Mermaid*, because soon it'll be locked away in the Disney Vault").

So now Beanie Babies had a ticking clock: you gotta buy them fast before they retire and disappear. A bunch of moms in the Chicago area started collecting Beanie Babies and saw that there was no price guide -- so they made one. These moms literally pulled dollar figures out of thin air and assigned each Beanie (current and retired) an utterly arbitrary price, and it stuck. Whatever they decided, that was the price -- because no one was saying otherwise. The moms compiled these figures into an (unofficial, but de facto official) price book, which spread amongst collectors.

Now we have a ticking clock and a price guide, but the craze still isn't taking off: Beanie Babies are appealing to collectors -- but not kids. So the Ty company adds two elements to the Beanie Babies' tags: a birthday, and a poem. Now the Beanies have **personality**. They have birthdays that kids can celebrate. And the public goes crazy. The Beanie Baby mania is unleashed. 

At the same time, a brand new technology is introduced, and the Ty company pounces on it: the Internet. Ty made themselves a website (one of the first toy companies to do so), and now kids could connect with the Beanie world even further. Kids could even "chat" with Beanie Babies on the Ty website. But as the internet evolved, the Ty website did not. It still exists today, and it looks like it's straight out of the 90s: http://www.ty.com

Another brand new website sprang up around the same time: eBay. With eBay, Beanie Baby collectors now had a way to buy and sell the toys across the state, across the country, across the world. An entire market was born almost overnight. Beanie Babies would not have been perceived as easy money, without Ebay paving the way.

But then, the downfall. Ty Warner -- the inventor of Beanie Babies, head of the Ty company, and kind of a crazy person -- **completely** over-saturated the market. New Beanie Babies were released rapid-fire and retired just as quickly. And suddenly, scarcity wasn't so much an issue anymore and the craze died down. 

The final nail in the coffin came at the turn of the millennium. Ty Warner announced that, at the stroke of midnight, *all* Beanie Babies would be retired. Ty thought this would reignite the frantic obsession -- but the public saw right through it, and identified it as a marketing gimmick. The mass retiring was a failure, and the Beanie Baby craze was officially dead. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Script reader here. Here's my explanation from a previous post. In my experience, script coverage is generally this: 

- Up top, note the script title, author, page count. And draft date, if the script has it. 

- LOGLINE: A concise one-sentence summary of the premise. For example, "*A New York cop must save his estranged wife from terrorists who have taken an L.A. office building hostage on Christmas Eve*."

- SYNOPSIS: A page-long summary of the story, covering the major beats from start to finish.

- COMMENTS: A page-long collection of your thoughts: what about the script worked, what didn't, and what could improve. In very simple terms, it's this: A) How inventive/original/dramatic is the premise? B) How strong is the execution of that premise? and C) How thorough are the characters? Is the story dramatic? Is it engaging? Is it original? Would you recommend it to your boss? 

- VERDICT: Verdict is one of three options: PASS (meaning it sucks), CONSIDER (meaning it's not great, but not bad), and RECOMMEND (meaning it's good). 

RECOMMENDs should be used sparingly -- only if the script's really fantastic.

CONSIDER is the one you really have to justify with your arguments, because it's kind of a weaselly answer. 

Some companies also use CONSIDER WITH RESERVATIONS, which is self-explanatory. You like some things about the script, but you also have reservations. 

PASS is pretty much the default. You'll be writing a lot of PASSes. 

Out of 300 scripts I'd covered, 203 received a PASS, 89 received a CONSIDER, and only 8 received a RECOMMEND.

A lot of studios/production companies will give you a coverage template to use, and you basically just fill in the blanks.  </TEXT>

$40 is what I get from the companies where I work as a reader. Maybe they've been underpaying me this whole time, who knows.

<TEXT>  Or liking the dialogue and giving it a two.

To be fair, *"the dialogue is both well stylized and easy to follow"* and *"cumbersome, direct lines that are difficult to believe"* aren't contradictory. I've read plenty of scripts with dialogue that leans more towards style, less towards realism/practicality. If a script tries to be Sorkin or Tarantino, it's likely to be stylized, yet cumbersome. 

So maybe this is what the reader is saying: the dialogue is stylistic and easy to follow -- it just doesn't click perfectly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not much to say about this game, except wow, I can't believe that Trebek literally tore Susan's head off and devoured her soul. I know this sub has criticized Trebek's behavior sometimes (often citing his age), but it's nice to see he's still got some vitality in him. Honestly, the retired librarian from Dayton, Ohio, didn't stand a chance. 

It bothered me a little bit that the correct response to every clue was "Who are, the Old Ones". I imagine it's just the end-of-the-week doldrums, but I expected the contestants to catch onto that quicker. 

Also, have we ever gotten a glimpse of the judges before? That was a nice peek behind the curtain. Their ominous chanting was a little hard to understand at times (which I guess is true for all hooded figures; the heavy fabric dulls the sound), but I'll admit it provided a nice distraction from an otherwise uneventful game. 

Congrats to the current champion; may the weekend bloodletting be swift and painless.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my experience (as a script reader), coverage is this: 

- Up top, note the script title, author, page count. And draft date, if the script has it. 

- LOGLINE: A concise one-sentence summary of the premise. For example, "*A New York cop must save his estranged wife from terrorists who have taken an L.A. office building hostage on Christmas Eve*."

- SYNOPSIS: A page-long summary of the story, covering the major beats from start to finish.

- COMMENTS: A page-long collection of your thoughts: what about the script worked, what didn't, and what could improve. In very simple terms, it's this: A) How inventive/original/dramatic is the premise? B) How strong is the execution of that premise? and C) How thorough are the characters? Is the story dramatic? Is it engaging? Is it original? Would you recommend it to your boss? 

- VERDICT: Verdict is one of three options: PASS (meaning it sucks), CONSIDER (meaning it's not great, but not bad), and RECOMMEND (meaning it's good). 

RECOMMENDs should be used sparingly -- only if the script's really fantastic.

CONSIDER is the one you really have to justify with your arguments, because it's kind of a weaselly answer. 

Some companies also use CONSIDER WITH RESERVATIONS, which is self-explanatory. You like some things about the script, but you also have reservations. 

A lot of studios/production companies will give you a coverage template to use, and you basically just fill in the blanks.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I read movie scripts for a living, and every time I read a horror script, my mind keeps coming back to [Erin](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/powerlisting/images/c/cc/You-re-next01.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140901011609) as an example of the perfect horror protagonist. 

Almost all the horror protagonists I read are panicky, insecure, running around -- *enduring* the madness, but not actually trying to negotiate it or influence it. Or, at best, they'll flail for two-thirds of the story, enduring all the horrifying sights, and then in the third act they'll pull themselves together and defeat the villain/slasher/demon/ghosts/whatever. 

And it never quite feels like a story  it feels like a showcase of cool horror elements the writer wanted to include. The protagonists are pretty much just reaction machines, or meatbags to be killed off by the cooler elements in the story.

But Erin? *Erin gets shit done*. 

While everyone else is panicking, Erin is running the goddamn show -- *Okay, here's what we need to do, here's how we're gonna do it, and let's go*. And she takes these fuckers **DOWN**. And my god, it is so refreshing to see a hero who immediately rises to the challenge, and who isn't just a damsel in distress getting spooked left and right. 

So cheers to you, you glorious Aussie badass. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The rise of Tarantino-isms. 

I will stand by my claim that Quentin Tarantino ruined a generation of screenwriters by making it okay to write lengthy scenes full of cool dialogue, all while the story gathers dust (which isn't even what Tarantino himself does). 

So what you've got now is writers mimicking Tarantino's style, but neglecting the substance underneath it -- What is the dialogue actually saying? About the characters, about the world, about the story? 

The weight isn't there, and the dialogue is just a bunch of cool words. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I used the word rocker in replace of 'teddy boy'. The film is set in 1979 and revolves around the Punk v Teddy Boy culture-clash in Britain

Ah, I see. Wasn't familiar with that clash. 

I think it would help to mention it's not just the boyfriend: he's got his own gang. That makes it sound like a conflict is coming -- as opposed to one man against a dozen, or whatnot. 

But if the focus is more the girl running away from home (as opposed to a gang war), then I would include more about her and her life. The fact that her boyfriend is abusive, for example, and the fact that she's happy with her new life -- those are big ideas. It doesn't sound like a downward spiral; it sounds more beneficial than destructive (at least, until the boyfriend arrives). 

So maybe "falls in with a gang of punks" is better, rather than "hitchhikes with a gang of punks"? Something to imply she's more comfortable with them, than with her existing life.

<TEXT> 1) "Catalyst to a culture war" is a very vague phrase; I'm not sure what that means. And it's not entirely clear how running away with a gang of punks starts that culture war. 

2) You could probably take out the "downward spiral", because that's kinda just a buzzword. *A reserved factory worker hitchhikes across the country with a gang of punks, sparking a gang war when her rocker boyfriend sets out to retrieve her*, maybe?

Although punks and rockers are a bit similar, in my mind, at least. 

Is it just the rocker boyfriend, against the gang of punks? Sounds like an uneven fight. How tough is this rocker boyfriend? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Day 570 of being stuck with the Gusenberg Sweeper </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-06 23:48:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I wake up and it's in my hand. I didn't put it there, I didn't grab it  it was already there. No matter how many times I try to put it down. The Gusenberg Sweeper doesn't let me drop it. 

The man at Ammo-Nation should've warned me. Or did he? When I bought the gun, things were different. The days were brighter. I could choose what weapons I held. I had control over my life. And then I saw the sign in the window: *St. Valentine's Day Massacre - SALE*. The Sweeper looked beautiful mounted on the wall, as seductive as the call of the Sirens luring sailors to their doom. The man behind the counter assured me, "That thing could take down a moose!" I asked to hold it. And my fate was sealed. 

The first touch was electric. "Look at you two together, what a lovely fuckin' couple!" I wish I had recognized the pain in the man's voice. His smile faltered, a crack in the faade his heart was struggling to maintain. He knew the curse had just claimed another victim: once a man holds the Gusenberg Sweeper, he will never let it go. A weapon forged in the depths of Hell, seeking out souls to poison and destroy. 

I tested the gun as soon as I left. The results were satisfactory. But as the days passed, and the gun's novelty wore off, until finally I'd had enough, and dropped it in the parking lot beside Del Perro Pier  but the gun wouldn't drop. I tensed as a panic quickly engulfed me. I tried again. The gun remained. My breaths grew shallow. I tried again. The gun remained. I fell to my knees, furiously shaking my arm, letting out a croaking cry. The gun remained. I couldn't even scream.

Sometimes I think about ending it. A burst of ratatat fire and the sweet release of death freeing me from the taunting, cold embrace of steel and wood against my calloused palm. But I know the gun would find a new victim, and I cannot let the curse continue. I walk the streets of Los Santos, every step another burden, the Gusenberg Sweeper hanging from my hand. Most of the police have learned to leave me be, but every now and then a rookie stops me. Tells me to freeze. Tells me to drop the weapon. I laugh, to keep from crying.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with every word. 

And this...

 they'll tell you that this guy is a bad ass.

...is specifically where a lot of problems occur: writers love to call their protagonist a badass. The first draft of *John Wick* fell into this trap a lot (and didn't entirely solve it, in my opinion). But it's harder for writers to actually *demonstrate* how their protagonist is a badass, aside from just saying it. 

So what you end up with is a protagonist described as a badass by every other character -- but when it comes time to demonstrate it he's just a standard action hero. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You know how when you're reading a book with a lot of dialogue, and occasionally you have to go back and look for a character name, because you can't tell who's saying which lines?

That's what it's like reading a script with a lot of CONTINUOUS. Okay, I get it, the setting is continuous but continuous from what? Continuous from the previous continuous? I go back one page, then another page, and then realize: Oh, okay, it's all continuous from this one utterance of the word "NIGHT" in a scene heading three pages earlier. 

So I'd stick with NIGHT, or THAT MOMENT (sparingly).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Script reader here. I see that a lot, and honestly, I'm not so much a fan of it. It's a bit of a shortcut that paints a picture in broad strokes, rather than getting detailed. I just think there are more striking ways to write it, that aren't as simplistic as "A = B". 

There's also the possibility of clash. If you describe a character as "Tom Hanks", but the character does things that (in my mental image of him) Tom Hanks would never do, then you've accidentally created an inconsistent character.

That being said, one of my all-time favorite character descriptions is an apocryphal one from *Panic Room*, where David Koepp describes Forest Whitaker's character as "*Humphrey Bogart in one of his less pleasant roles*". I don't know if that ever made it into the script, but it's always stuck in my mind: succinct, vivid, clean.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> James Dean was an exceptional actor; one of the early adopters of Method acting, as opposed to the classical Humphrey Bogart/James Cagney model. He earned two Oscar nominations, but only starred in three movies.

"Rebel Without a Cause" is his most famous film, because it was one of the first major movies to address an audience that Hollywood had never thought to target: teenagers. Movies were made for adults and children, but with "Rebel Without a Cause", teenagers were finally given a screen idol of their own. 

Dean's popularity grew as a result -- and then his career was cut short by his death. And as is the case with a star who burns out quickly, Dean's iconic status was solidified. So Dean's legend is partly due to his acting, and partly due to the fact that he died at the beginning of a very promising career. Tragedy breeds icons. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a feeling I know what the comments on *BvS* will be. Nobody is going to know which parts Goyer wrote and which parts Terrio wrote. So, anything good about the writing will be attributed to Terrio; anything bad about the writing will be attributed to Goyer. 

I think the same thing is going to happen with *Ant-Man*. Anything good about the movie will be attributed to Edgar Wright, before he left the project. Anything bad about the movie will be attributed to Peyton Reed, who stepped in after Wright left. 

You see it already in this sub, when people talk about "producers" or "studio" as an evil entity. If a movie is bad, everybody blames the producers. If a movie is good, nobody credits the producers. Because the popular narrative says that producers are "bad". And everything has to fit the narrative.

Once you have "good" or "bad" assigned to you, then everything that falls into your category is automatically dumped on you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was actually never bothered by that one. 

I mean, Gerry's in the middle of a zombie apocalypse, society is crumbling, people are dying -- Anyone would be looking for *one*, just *one* remnant of the way things used to be, or the normal life that's never coming back and then he passes a soda machine. And boom. One fleeting moment of normalcy, amid the chaos. 

[Not to mention: Gerry's practically just solved the zombie threat at that point. Wouldn't you celebrate? Somehow? Any way you could? And it even has a plot point attached to it: Gerry releases the cans onto the floor, and the loud clattering noise draws the zombies away from the doors.]  

It just works, in my opinion. If you were facing the zombie apocalypse, and you came across a remnant of a better time, wouldn't you take it? A can of pop? Fuck it, sure. It's the same reason why Will Smith plays golf and drives a Mustang in *I Am Legend*, or why Tallahassee likes Twinkies in *Zombieland*: because it's comfortable, in an uncomfortable time. 

They do the same scene in *The Road*, too. It's the post-apocalypse, and the Man and the Boy stop at a Coke machine for this one reminder of how things once were.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get that, but the problem is, it matches Lou's state of mind -- but it doesn't match *our* state of mind, as an audience. 

If you show us something horrific and you put uplifting music on top of it, there's gonna be a tonal disconnect -- no matter what you say about the anti-hero's state of mind. The music may mirror his attitude perfectly but it doesn't mirror *our* attitude. There's an unspoken assumption that a movie's soundtrack is "on our side", so to speak. But in *Nightcrawler*, it's not. And that's why it doesn't fit, in my opinion. 

Other than that, fantastic movie. But every time the music swells, I'm just left with this feeling of "really?" 

If Gilroy is trying to create unease I gotta say, we're already uneasy, given what we're seeing. The tonal disconnect is the wrong kind of unease: it's like a technical unease, not a diegetic unease. All the other components (the themes, the exposition, the camerawork, the delivery) are "on our side", aiding our experience, helping us feel the moment -- but the music is working against us. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  There's a note in improv that goes, You followed the plot. It's not a good note to get. What it means is that rather than spending a three minute scene exploring the ideas presented and creating fun, textural details, the improvisers rushed to incident.

I've seen more examples of the opposite, in the scripts I've read: pages and pages of plot-less talk, milking the idea dry and still going, while the story gathers dust. We get it, these are our characters, now where's the story to put them to use?

It's a narrow middle ground. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My thoughts:

-- One line of prose (e.g. "Funeral of PAUL MASHABA's wife") is a very short scene for the next one to go "One week earlier". We don't even know who Paul is, yet we're supposed to be mourning his wife's death? At this point, it's just an abstract funeral. 

-- Some very expository dialogue: "Didn't you see my white shirt Lebo? The one I love wearing when going into town?" Same with "Go back to your broken bicycle", and "Since my mother died everyone just manipulates me." These characters are telling us everything single we need to know, and it's hurting the flow. These don't sound like real characters talking. 

-- I'd use some contractions to make the dialogue feel natural. "I am sorry dad" has a stilted feel. 

-- You don't have to write "astonished face" in the parenthetical. Just "astonished" will do. 

-- These characters don't feel very broken up over the death of their mother. No one is adjusting to the new life, or trying to get over their feelings -- they're just going through their daily routines, as usual. 

-- It's hard to judge the story in these pages, because the story hasn't really begun. But it does seem as though there are some unnecessary elements. I'm wondering why Lebo's mother even has to die in the first place. Why not have the family be Lebo, Bill, and Paul, and then Paul dies and Lebo is forced to fend for herself, and goes down the path you mentioned? 

The story you mentioned above shows promise, but what's written in these pages is very stilted and expository, introducing all the characters for later purposes, letting the story idle in the meantime.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Read every single word aloud. Every. Single. Word. Does it flow? Do you trip over the words? Where are the pauses? Where are the accents? Does it have rhythm? By law, any conversation about dialogue and rhythm has to link to [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kZg_ALxEz0).

In any scene, if you were in that specific situation yourself, what would you say? How would you phrase the idea, articulate the idea?

Which character has the power in the scene? How does he/she use it? Demonstrate it? And how can the power dynamic shift? *Every* dramatic conversation is a battle over the power of the scene -- like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFHYiOfBRng) or [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8PxG5zvgOM).

<TEXT> Gender doesn't matter with regards to the PASS/CONSIDER/RECOMMEND verdict, in the sense that the gender of a specific character -- done well or poorly -- will not help decide a specific verdict. But a character is written **poorly** (male or female) will. 

And no, believe it or not, there wasn't an instance of a script's **sole** male character serving as a crutch. That's what I meant by underwritten female part: there's only one woman in the entire script, and she's the Standard Love Interest. I didn't find any examples of the male equivalent.

Now, does there need to be a strong female character in every movie? No, of course not. Just look at *12 Angry Men* and *Glengarry Glen Ross*. But poor characters stand out. So when there's only one woman and she's shitty, that's when the "underwritten female part" comes into play. 

And, though the infographic doesn't state this explicitly, the headings "The villains are too cartoonish" and "The protagonist is a standard issue hero" ultimately apply to male characters. "The protagonist is not as strong as need be" applies to male and female protagonists. 

There's no evil plot here, or double standard. I'm not some uber-feminist demanding strong female characters in every story. All I noticed was that male writers, generally, have trouble writing female characters. That's all.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> With an absence of female lead characters, the female presence in those script was generally condensed to one specific role: the Love Interest, who doesn't affect the story or the characters, and is simply a crutch for the male hero to lean on during lulls in the plot. 

Poorly-written female characters generally fall into one of three categories:

-- Crutch (something for the hero to lean on, or kill time with)

-- Corpse (lives only to be killed, often to motivate the hero)

-- Eye Candy (nice to look at)

Poorly-written males characters, on the other hand, had -- frankly -- lots more ways to fail, which are detailed in that infographic. It's just that poorly-written female characters failed in very specific ways (above), and thus deserved their own little heading.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I made this (http://i.imgur.com/T22gGBO.png), which lists the stats as such. Out of 300 scripts:

-- 204 had male protagonists, 77 had female protagonists. (And 19 had ensemble heroes). 

-- 8 were "RECOMMEND", 89 were "CONSIDER", 203 were "PASS". 

Unfortunately I don't have the data for the genders of the "RECOMMEND" scripts. 

But the thing is: it doesn't matter. The gender of the protagonist has **no bearing whatsoever** on the PASS/CONSIDER/RECOMMEND verdict. Even if, say, all eight of the RECOMMEND scripts had male protagonists, that wouldn't prove anything: correlation does not equal causation. 

Frankly, you might as well look at page count to determine what makes a "RECOMMEND" script. Details like that don't matter. What matters is the strength of the story and characters. 

for reading. Now, for *production*, maybe there's a different story. But, for me as a script reader, the protagonist's gender has no significance, and no influence on the final verdict. 

The Ellen Ripley way definitely works, even if it's a little indirect. I've always thought of it this way: Why would an actress want to play your female character? What would be appealing about the character to, say, Charlize Theron?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Script reader here. I would **never** ding a script just because it has a female protagonist. If the character is strong, and if the story is strong, the gender of the protagonist doesn't matter. 

Now, are well-written female protagonists more rare than well-written male protagonists? I'd say so. Probably because the majority of writers are male, and have a harder time writing about women than about men. 

This doesn't mean that scripts with female protagonists are inherently and objectively bad; they're not. They're just harder for most writers to do well.

But I won't dismiss a script for having a female protagonist. I'll dismiss it if it's a bad script. And the criteria for "bad" has no relation to the gender of the hero.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-10-10 01:48:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> All of a sudden, in every other script I read, there is a distinct moment where the characters call attention to a detail/action/behavior and say something along the lines of:

*"This isn't the movies, kid. This is real."*

*"That's just some Hollywood fantasy; that's not how it is in real life."*

*"It's not like it is in the movies."*

Dismissing the "Hollywood" representation of an idea as inauthentic, and insisting that **this** is how it's really done -- in the middle of a cliched, Hollywood script. It's a weird irony. 

Now, if I take off my script reader hat and put on my Barbara Streisand in *The Prince of Tides* ass-masking therapist pantsuit, I'd say something as pretentious as: Some writers are disillusioned by the "phony" state of Hollywood movies and have embarked upon a quest for authenticity even in inarguably "Hollywood"ish scripts. 

Or, you know, whatever. 

*   *   *

EDIT: There's another trend that sticks in my mind. I swear I've read this at least five times in the last three months: [the Cherokee "two wolves" story](http://www.firstpeople.us/FP-Html-Legends/TwoWolves-Cherokee.html) 

One character describes to another a story told to him/her by a grandfather/parent/mentor/etc. The story goes, there are two wolves inside each of us, locked in an endless battle. 

One wolf is evil - he is anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego. 

The other wolf is good - he is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith.

Which wolf wins? The one that you feed. 

It's the idea that if you harbor hate, it corrupts you and it'll eventually be all you see, and the same goes for good. 

It's kind of becoming the new [Scorpion and Frog parable](http://johnaugust.com/2012/the-scorpion-and-the-frog).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll take a stab at answering your question here, away from the downvote downpour. 

 I'm writing a story that sets in a small town in Southern California which later escalates into the city of Los Angeles. So the first act sets in a small town in Southern California, and the 2nd and 3rd act sets in Los Angeles. How can I write a story that sets in Los Angeles without looking like an amateur? What kind of research should I do? Thanks.

I definitely would recommend Googling small towns in Southern California, just to know what's out there. Ojai, Cambria, and Julian come to mind. 

As for tone, it doesn't really matter if LA folks act differently than NY folks, because it's negligible difference. There are saints, sinners, angels, and assholes in every city, and in every story. You could write a script set in LA with all pricks, or a story set in LA with all kind-hearted folks, and both would be fine. *End of Watch*'s Los Angeles is very different from *500 Days of Summer*'s Los Angeles, but they both work. It's your story; you can make the city whatever you want.

As for accuracy, it honestly doesn't matter. I'm a script reader (living in LA), and if I read a script that, for example, confused Sunset Blvd and Hollywood Blvd, I wouldn't care. I'm not judging scripts based on their factual accuracy; I'm judging them based on the story they tell. So as long you don't make any major mistakes (e.g. if you made it snow in Los Angeles), I won't pay them much attention. I'd suggest just checking a map of LA, or Googling the area/building/location, to make sure whatever detail you're using is what/where you need it to be. 

If you're worried about coming across as an amateur, that will be FAR more apparent in the *story* than the *accuracy*. A script that can't tell a good story screams amateur much louder than a script that confuses its geography. 

The other commenters may have made this point a bit harshly, but there might be some merit in not setting the script in Los Angeles. If I read a drug/mob story set in LA, there is a voice in the back of my mind that says "I've seen this story before". On the other hand, if I read a drug/mob story set in -- for example -- Portland or Monterey or Lahaina or Gainesville or Salt Lake City, then it's definitely fresh and new. Just look at *Breaking Bad*'s setting in Albuquerque, or *True Detective*'s setting in backwoods Louisiana. Setting is just as important as character or story; new is always appealing -- as long as you make it *work*, of course. 

If they announced that *True Detective*'s season two was taking place in NY or LA, I wouldn't be half as excited as I am now, knowing it'll actually take place on the California Coast. A cool setting means a lot.

(Note: If you do want a rough primer course in Los Angeles, play Grand Theft Auto V. That city lines up pretty closely to Los Angeles, in terms of geography and, surprisingly, tone)

EDIT: And it doesn't matter if there's not a well-known drug scene/mob racket in Portland -- invent one. There doesn't have to be a preexisting meth empire in Albuquerque for *Breaking Bad* to work.

<TEXT> International sales is what happened. Westerns are a distinctly American genre, playing off of American history and mythology. 

So in a movie marketplace that relies so heavily on international appeal, the western kind of fell by the wayside, because westerns don't play so well in countries that don't have that specific connection to the Wild West. 

Comedy, romance, action, horror: these are all universal genres and can be translated across cultures. But the western is purely American, and that led to its demise.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I couldn't agree with him more about jump scares. The quality of a movie is inversely proportional to the number of jump scares used. It's a cheap tactic used by lazy directors.

I don't buy that. What about [the sudden shot of Pazuzu's face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TD0RJ_iuBPo) in *The Exorcist*? That's totally a jump scare. 

Or look at *Friday the 13th*, and [the lunge out of the water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqKsp7UxMA8).

Or look at *Carrie*, and its famous [final jump scare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAXU_7EyXFE).

Or look at *Jaws*; the scariest [scenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I91DJZKRxs) in that movie are [jump scares](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFyoBf0CWI).

Or go back fifteen years, to the movie that legitimized the horror genre, *Psycho*, which is remembered **explicitly for** its jump scares, [like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WtDmbr9xyY), [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bieIiX5KLQ), [and this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWHYmNrAFlI). 

Or hell, go back to 1925 for *The Phantom of the Opera*, famous for its great jump scare, [the unmasking scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sa3bHKWZoJg).

Or look at current movies, like the [cornfield scene in Signs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz3KQgqJgPE), or the [red tent scene in The Sixth Sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRAjzK75M0U), or the [the sloth victim in Seven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8m69o_1PoQ). Or every single scare in [The Thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqVbOSEsJNo). Or the quick cutaway jump scare from The Ring, which I won't link because it freaks me out.

The quality of the movie is inversely proportional to the number of jump scares used? What movies have you been watching? Jump scares are present in the greatest horror movies ever made. 

Now, are they *more* present these days? Possibly. But you can't say jump scares a hallmark of bad horror or lazy directors. </TEXT>

That's kind of a shitty, self-centered attitude, man.

Also, wait: you say you're not going to see the movie in theaters with friends... but you are going to watch it on Netflix with friends? So, *Godzilla* has been ruthlessly spoiled -- though apparently not spoiled enough. It's been $12-ticket-price spoiled, not completely spoiled.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the content is fine; the problem is misinformation. Discussions about the movie industry (e.g. casting choices, project announcements) frequently devolve into *"Hollywood does this / believes this / assumes this / thinks we think this"*, and the argument is simplified into a vague non-point. It's tempting to use "Hollywood" as a catch-all boogeyman for an intricate, complex industry ([examples](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/search?q=hollywood restrict_sr=on)), but that entity doesn't exist. It's like when anti-gay opponents complain about "the gay agenda", or government critics condense convoluted politics into a game of It's The President's Fault No Matter What.

Or worse, someone asks a question about the business, someone else replies with "$$$", and that's the upvoted answer. No explanation, no analysis; money is the answer to everything, apparently. 

More often than not, the conversation is not discussion -- it's speculation. Except nobody admits they're speculating.

Case in point: the Chris Evans revelation. When the story of his situation first broke, I saw comments calling him whiny, calling him a money-hungry slut, and using the same dismissive logic: *"He has problems? Bullshit, he's rich and he's famous, he can't have problems. He's just whining."* No one here actually knows the inner workings of that situation. Discussing the matter only clouded it, and honest sympathy for Evans was drowned out by the cynical voices.

Who among us really knows how the movie industry works? Not what THR or Vanity Fair reports, not what shows up on Deadline or AICN. I mean like actual, firsthand experience of the business. Without that, /r/movies won't be more than folks standing on soapboxes outside the arena, claiming expertise on the arena's inner workings.

And with that, I'll step down from my anti-soapbox soapbox. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is all subjective, but I'm not the only one who reads the script: most often, I'm the second opinion to the creative executive themselves. 

And I agree, great movies can have flaws, but that's the thing: I wrote that infographic as a list of *flaws*, not a list of *rules*. Those were the areas in which the scripts I read specifically failed, but the same can't be said for **all** scripts. These were just the ones that did it poorly. I didn't make that inforgraphic to teach the hard-and-fast rules of screenwriting; I was simply listing the problems I'd encountered in 300 spec scripts I'd read. That's all they were: problems in *those* scripts, not in *all* scripts. 

I mean, *Glengarry Glen Ross* and *12 Angry Men* have underwritten female parts, and they're masterpieces. If a story is good, if the characters are strong, if the voice is clear, then who cares if it has a few flaws? I don't let the Rules of Writing dictate my verdict on a script. If it's good, it's good, warts and all.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That infographic did cover the *recommends*: out of the 300 scripts, 8 got a recommend. 

And there really isn't much to say about *recommend* scripts: they just did everything right. The story was complete and engaging, the characters were strong, the dialogue was smooth, etc, etc. What else is there to say?

There are a lot of ways for a script to go wrong, but only a few ways for a script to go right: everything just *works*. All those flaws I listed? The *recommend* scripts didn't do them, simple as that. 

The truth is, when you're doing coverage, you're not looking for reasons a script is good. You're looking for reasons a script is **bad**, so the production companies can justify passing on it and throwing it in the trash. With millions of dollars at stake, *pass* is the default; *recommend* is the aberration.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would argue that the Joker doesn't represent evil, but rather chaos. He doesn't see himself as a villain; he sees himself as -- like he says -- an agent of chaos, aiming to prove this world isn't as secure as we all pretend it is. *"I'm not a monster... I'm just ahead of the curve."*

Maybe the term "hero of their own story" wasn't the most appropriate for the Joker and Chigurh. But I don't think they see themselves as villains; I think they see themselves as forces of nature, like you say. Not good, nor bad; they just **do** things, just as the Joker says. 

My point in the infographic was, these villains were memorable not because they were trying to be the Villain-with-a-capital-V with smarmy monologues and popcorn psychopathy, but because they were far more complex than an evil cardboard cutout. Great villains are painted in shades of grey, not stark black-and-white. 

Landa, in my opinion, totally believes he's the hero. I mean, come on: he single-handedly ends the War and arranges for the accolades to land on him. He does everything with such control, always gaining the upper hand, that he can't possibly not see himself as the hero. His actions are villainous, but that doesn't mean he doesn't justify them as means to a greater good. </TEXT>

Context: I read spec scripts and write coverage for a living, and after reading 300 scripts I compiled the data into an infographic.

And there's no "romance" because every romantic script I read was not just a romance, but an extraordinary romance. People don't simply fall in love anymore in scripts; there's always something extraordinary about the circumstances (e.g. *Titanic*, *Benjamin Button*).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think it's quite right to pin bad movies on a single bad writer. There is barely a major blockbuster produced in the last twenty years that had only one writer. Those scripts go through a dozen writers, each tweaking and perfecting the story, and very often it becomes a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth: a dozen minds with a dozen ideas results in a messy script. (Off the top of my head, I think *Limitless* was the last big movie that only had one writer, and she had to fight to keep it that way)

So it's not a case of idealistic writers being corrupted, losing their writerly instincts, and churning out shit scripts. It's that studios and companies, understandably, don't want to risk millions on a single person's crazy idea. Studios like a sure thing, and that generally means bringing in more writers, because the assumption is more writers = better script. Sometimes that's the case, sometimes it's not.  </TEXT>

Maybe it's a side character who can play a bigger role in the story. Maybe it's a plot point that can have complications added to it. Maybe it's an added step in the plot, a Plot Point B to put between Plot Point A and Plot Point C. 

No matter the story, there's always material you can add. The problem is making those additions feel vital, and not like extremities you pasted on to make the script look longer.

<TEXT> I realized I should've examined protagonists a bit closer, but I only had my stacks of coverages; I didn't have the scripts anymore to verify age/race/sexuality/etc. But as for the question:

 Do you have a sense of how many protagonists you saw who weren't the default young, white, straight?

Young and straight, absolutely; probably 90%. But it's hard to tell with regards to race: often, the writer doesn't include the characters' races, unless the name gives it away. Maybe that's a wise move: you wouldn't want to turn off Denzel by writing the role for DiCaprio. 

But the best was when the writer presented an unspoken assumption that every character is white, until it was specifically noted otherwise (e.g. "...*where we meet JOHN, a skinny black man, who*..."). Since, apparently, white is the norm for society.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Overall, the scripts fall into two categories: 1) derivative, and 2) unexciting. The majority of scripts either feel very familiar and are little more than a by-the-book retelling of a basic premise, or have a good idea but don't quite know how to turn it into an engaging script. 

I think it's definitely inexperience. Every week, I read a script that's like a mirror to my early years as a writer: I made the exact same mistakes and produced the exact same shoddy result, convinced of my own brilliance. It's embarrassing to think about, but I have without a doubt written scripts as bad as the worst scripts I've read. But I learned, I improved, so I wonder what will happen to those same writers whose bad scripts I read. Maybe after a few more scripts, they'll look back on their work with the same embarrassment I do towards mine. 

I don't know how terrible scripts wind up in my hands, and I've read some really terrible ones. But I respect the mystery. Makes my job easier, anyway: it's easier to condemn a terrible script than wade through a so-so script.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the late story is a result of writers loving their characters a bit too much. It's certainly something I did when I started writing: your babies are the characters, not the story. The writer wants to introduce his/her characters without any distractions, so we can come to love them as much as they do. So it's forty pages of character introductions, before a story arrives to put them to use. There's nothing that says we can't meet the characters *and* begin a story at the same time. Trial by fire: we learn who the characters are, as they're battling the story conflict. 

Maybe the problem is also a case of misidentification: us meeting the characters *isn't part of the story*. The story needs to be self-contained; introducing the heroes to the external audience isn't Chapter One. 

As for the RECOMMEND scripts, there's nothing I could really do with them. I can't reveal specifics about those scripts, obviously, so there's little I could say. Besides, there's no secret winning strategy those 8 scripts nailed. They just had good stories and told them well. It's such a case-by-case business; there's never any hard-and-fast rule to writing a good script. 

To get a RECOMMEND, you need to do everything right; to get a CONSIDER, you just need to do one thing right. You need a good premise, or a fun protagonist, or an engaging voice, or a remarkable ending: you need one strong element that catches my attention and makes the script worth considering. There have been a lot of cases where I've written CONSIDER WITH RESERVATIONS (for the premise): the script was terrible, but it had a good idea buried within it -- it just didn't know what to do with it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> All of the above. 

If you do something new, then you're already ahead of the pack. Nobody's interested in telling a story that's already been told twenty times (well, actually, they are, but this is for spec scripts). Go in a new direction and make it work, but don't assume I'll give it a RECOMMEND just for the novelty. A street juggler with chainsaws is more entertaining than a street juggler with torches -- but he still has to be able to juggle them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't describe script specifics due to confidentiality issues, but I give a RECOMMEND if I can't find anything to criticize. The script has a great idea (or a great execution of an okay idea) and took chances. A RECOMMEND script doesn't have to buck the tropes; it just has to use them well, and has to have some self-awareness as it's using them. Edgar Wright and Rian Johnson are both aware of the tropes of their genres (film noir, cop movie, caper flick, zombie movie, sci-fi), but know how to use them in a fresh way. Tropes are tropes for a reason: they work.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I dunno, it should be pretty self-explanatory, but to expand on a few:

THE NARRATIVE FALLS INTO A REPETITIVE PATTERN

It goes back to [Trey Parker and Matt Stone's advice](http://splitsider.com/2011/09/trey-parker-and-matt-stone-crash-an-n-y-u-writing-class): the story isn't strong enough if it's just a series of "and"s. *This happens, and then this happens, and then this happens...* Their advice was to replace "and"s with "but"s and "therefore"s. *The heroes do this, therefore this happens, but then this happens, therefore the heroes do this, but then this happens..."* A good story, like a good piece of music, evolves and builds as it moves along. 

Pretentious analogy: Check out [Beethoven's 7th, Op. 92: II. Allegretto](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhARR-zmTCE) and hear it start slow, before the momentum starts building, the different instruments coming in and out, joining together, until the piece reaches its climax. Beethoven's 7th is a great illustration of a story's crescendo and climax, so it's no surprise that [it's already been used as such](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fY3BOcjAnw).

THE VILLAINS ARE CARTOONISH, EVIL-FOR-THE-SAKE-OF-EVIL

As much as I love *Die Hard*, I don't want to read another script about a Hans Gruber knock-off. It's really tempting and so much goddamn fun to write big, hammy bad guys, but it's a shortcut. I can't count the number of times I've quoted *The Incredibles* while reading a script: "He starts monologuing! He starts this prepared speech about how feeble I am compared to him, how inevitable my defeat is, how the world will soon be his... The guy's got me on a platter, and he won't shut up!" If you're worried your villain is too corny, imagine Dr. Evil saying his lines: if you added jokes, would your scene fit perfectly in *Austin Powers 4*?

THE FEMALE PART IS UNDERWRITTEN

There's no easy solution for this: it's hard for guys to write girls, and vice versa. That's just human nature. Maybe a trick is imagining the actress' reaction: if the female role is so one-dimensional, why would an actress want to play it? How could you strengthen that role to give an actress something to sink her teeth into? Joss Whedon and Woody Allen have a pretty good track record for writing female characters; there's lots to learn from their work.

THE SCRIPT FAVORS STYLE OVER SUBSTANCE

In my opinion, *Lucky Number Slevin* is the perfect example of style over substance. I love it, but it definitely tries very hard to be cool, in story, in twists, in character, in dialogue. There's nothing wrong with making your script zing, but don't make it empty zing: have the goods to back up the style. *The Matrix*, in my opinion, combined style and substance very well: the movie had flash, but damn did it ever have a story too. It varies from genre to genre: the balance between style and substance is harder to maintain in different types of stories. 

THE ENDING IS ANTI-CLIMACTIC

*Casino Royale* ends with a fitting anti-climax: not everything is solved onscreen, but you're still left with a sense of closure (i.e. "The name's Bond. James Bond."). It may not be the best example, since the story continues in the Bond franchise, but I didn't need to see Mr. White die to feel satisfied. *The Matrix*, to a lesser extent, ends with a minor anti-climax: the bigger problem isn't fixed, but it's sure gonna be. 

THE CONFLICT IS INCONSEQUENTIAL, FLASH IN THE PAN

It's like the writer knows the heroes' plan needs to hit some obstacles, so he throws in a quick problem that takes one page to solve, and then continues on without a hitch. *Inception* negotiates it well: whenever a problem arises during the heroes' plan, that problem lingers (e.g. Saito getting shot, Fischer having armed subconscious projections, Fischer dying in the snow level, Mal sabotaging Cobb's scheme). The problem is never gone within a page; it remains until the end. 

THE PROTAGONIST IS A STANDARD ISSUE HERO / THE CHARACTERS ARE STEREOTYPES

If your characters don't have their own TvTropes page, all the better. I will stand by my claim that *Galaxy Quest* is one of the smartest movies ever made, in part because the characters aren't just characters. 

THE SCRIPT SUFFERS FROM ARBITRARY COMPLEXITY

I read a lot of scripts wherein the writer threw in an armful of plotlines to keep the story busy and the waters swirling. The problem is, the writer is aware that not all of these plotlines are important, but will ignore it because he needs the pages. But I can tell when I'm reading it: if I'm keeping track of a dozen plotlines and muttering out loud "Well what does this have to do with anything else?" to half of them, the script's in trouble. *The Prestige* and *Glengarry Glen Ross* both have three or four plotlines to manage, but each of them has a purpose in the greater story. All the plotlines eventually converge dramatically, and that's what matters. If you keep your plotlines separate, and parallel, I'll end up asking "What's the point of Plotline #9 here?"

THE PLOT UNRAVELS THROUGH COINCIDENCE/CONTRIVANCE

[John August](http://johnaugust.com/2007/perils-of-coincidence) explains it better than I can. 

THE SCRIPT IS TONALLY CONFUSED

Sometimes writers are afraid to really get their hands dirty. You've just killed a character, everything is going wrong for the hero, and you're worried that all this drama/chaos/pain will turn people off, so you add a joke to lighten the mood. If people were indeed unhappy with the drama, they're going to be doubly unhappy that you just invalidated all that drama by capping it off with a joke. *The Ice Harvest* and *No Country for Old Men* mix heavy drama and black comedy successfully. I have no idea how, but they do. 

THE PROTAGONIST IS NOT AS STRONG AS NEED BE

Meaning the protagonist is basically just a vehicle through which to view the story. He/she does what's required of them, scurries along, but isn't at all memorable. As much as I like the movie, *Hollywoodland* falls into this trap: Louis Simo fulfills his role as protagonist, but that movie's strength lies elsewhere. Hell, even *The Dark Knight* encounters this problem: Batman does what he needs to do, but kinda pales in comparison to the Joker. 

THE PREMISE IS A TRANSPARENT EXCUSE FOR ACTION

Frankly put: the writer has shit he wants to see, and has pulled together a bare bones premise to allow it. Writing for yourself (as opposed to writing for the audience) is great advice, but it can be taken too far. You may have to kill your darlings: if a sequence/scene has nothing to do with the premise/story/theme, it has to go, even if you love it. It's a script, not a sizzle reel. 

THE SUPERNATURAL ELEMENT IS TOO UNDEFINED

If the ghosts/demons/aliens/vampires appear to be omnipotent, then what's stopping them from ending the conflict immediately? Even supernatural creatures need boundaries and limitations. That's why werewolves have the full moon/silver bullets, vampires have garlic/daylight/stakes, ghosts have the boundaries of the haunted house: there needs to be something preventing them from slaughtering the heroes at the first sign of trouble. What *can* the supernatural begins do, and what *can't* they do, and *why*? 

THE STORY IS ONE BIG SHRUG

After a few scripts, I've literally said out loud, "Well what was the point of that?" Sometimes it's unclear what we're meant to be entertained by, or captivated by. This is definitely a case-by-case problem; it's hard to explain in vague terms. 

THE SCRIPT IS A POTBOILER

This doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad story; *The Lincoln Lawyer* is a great potboiler movie. But sometimes a script just hits all the necessary beats, tells a doable story, and comes and goes without much excitement. The script might be a nice distraction for two hours on a Tuesday night, but I want something more. 

THE SCENES ARE VOID OF MEANINGFUL CONFLICT

[David Mamet](http://movieline.com/2010/03/23/david-mamets-memo-to-the-writers-of-the-unit/) said it best.

THE SCRIPT MAKES A REFERENCE, BUT NOT A JOKE

aka the [Seltzer](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0783536/?ref_=tt_ov_dr)-[Friedberg](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0294997/?ref_=tt_ov_dr) Model of Comedy.

THE DRAMA/CONFLICT IS TOLD, NOT SHOWN

I see this a lot in action movies: the villains will be discussing the hero who's coming to kill them, and will describe the badass feats he has accomplished, to sell the idea that this guy is not to be fucked with. He took down three black ops mercenaries with a pencil; he blew up Big Dino's office and burnt him alive; he slaughtered the Chinese triads with a half-empty revolver. It's all very colorful, but we're not seeing it happen and it doesn't matter, because it happened in the past, outside of the current story. *The Usual Suspects* did the same thing to Keyser Soze, but it worked in that movie because Keyser Soze was more than just a character: he was a mystery, and one that drove the story. But in these scripts, making a character badass by having other characters call him badass is lazy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The card just before the seven of diamonds has been cut a quarter of a centimeter shorter than the rest of the cards in the deck. That means when he riffles through the deck, there will be a *tiny, tiny* but unconsciously noticeable gap that lets the seven of diamonds linger in our view for longer than the other cards. It's a split second longer, but it's enough for us to see. 

Right after the "That was too fast" riffle, you can see there's a gap in the deck just past the halfway point. That gap is the too-short card.

You can actually duplicate this with your own deck, if you cut one of the cards just a quarter of a centimeter short. Whatever card comes after that one is the card the audience is going to see.

<TEXT> I disagree. Early Stewie was even more one-note than he is now and had absolutely nowhere go. 

The two things Early Stewie wants more than everything (taking over the world and killing Lois) will *never happen*. If either of those happened, the show would be over. So Early Stewie either had to evolve out of that character to have somewhere to go, or we'd spend every episode waiting for something that never happens and never will happen. Because despite all his gadgetry, all his evil intentions, all his genius, the logical end of his character will never arrive.

Also, you can't tell me that Stewie's obtuse vernacular wouldn't get a *tiny* bit tiring after eleven seasons. "Vile woman" this and "wretched womb" that. 

Current Stewie, on the other hand, isn't as one-note. Yes, he's effeminate, but he's not gay; his many female love interests prove that. That conflict alone makes him a more thorough character than Early Stewie. Current Stewie has somewhere to go and ways to grow that Early Stewie did not.

Brian is a better character now for the same reason. He's no longer the character who has all his shit together, he's something better: the character who only *thinks* he has his shit together. He's got real problems in a real life, frequently with real relationships, of which he had none back when he was simply a smartass with one-liners. Brian was nothing more than Peter's smart-alecy sidekick, but now he's a full, troubled character of his own right. I think it's an improvement.

<TEXT> * [Copperfield vanishing the Statue of Liberty](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAEw-gtDkO4): [him, the audience, and the camera are actually standing on a moving platform. The curtain goes up, hiding the Statue from view, and the platform - very, very slowly, imperceptibly - *rotates*. The lights around the Status go dark, and when the curtain is pulled back, the Statue appears to be gone -- because everyone is now facing another direction. If you were watching the illusion from Manhattan, the Statue would still be there (it just wouldn't be illuminated).](/spoiler)

* Houdini vanishing the elephant: [mirrors. When you look inside the box (where the elephant was just standing), you're only seeing half the box. There's a mirror running down the middle, concealing one half of the box (where the elephant is) and reflecting the other, empty half of the box.](/spoiler)

* Sawing a woman in half: [fake legs, or two women.](/spoiler)

* If you ever go to the Disneyland magic shop, you'll see three tricks: the floating card, the fingertip lights, and the rising cards. [Floating card: it's invisible thread, running from the card, through the magician's fingers, to the magician's vest. The card hangs there, like a puppet; you can't tell because it's always spinning, rather than simply hanging. Fingertip lights: a special apparatus on the fingertips, that's all. Rising cards: only half the deck is real. The other half is a big block (disguised as cards) which holds a small pulley system loads with a weight (like an elevator/counterweight). The chosen card is stuck to the pulley system, and when the deck is turned upside-down, the weight descends -- pulling the pulley up, and making the card rise from the deck.](/spoiler)

* Cups and balls: [it's four balls, not three, and a lot of sleight-of-hand to conceal and load the fourth. *All* close up magic relies on two things: sleight-of-hand, and memory.](/spoiler) [Watch Penn   Teller give a quick sleight-of-hand lesson.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXGr76CfoCs) Close-up magic is just gorgeous. Every close-up effect is a result of dedication and practice. This means there are no simple explanations for close-up effects; no gotchas or gimmicks or "Oh, of course, it's so obvious". It's one artful move after another: conceal, load, produce, and repeat. That's the difference between close-up magic and stage magic: once you learn the secret behind a close-up effect, you're still amazed. Differently amazed, but still amazed. You used to be baffled, now you're just impressed. 

If you've got time to kill: 

* [Ricky Jay and His 52 Assistants](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLQaGb_H760). Arguably the best card magician working today.
