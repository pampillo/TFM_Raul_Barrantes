AP: Obviously, that's going to come in a week where you're going to be running up against the deadline for keeping the government open. If you get a bill on your desk that does not include funding for the wall, will you sign it? TRUMP: I don't know yet. People want the border wall. My base definitely wants the border wall, my base really wants it  you've been to many of the rallies. OK, the thing they want more than anything is the wall. My base, which is a big base; I think my base is 45 percent. You know, it's funny. The Democrats, they have a big advantage in the electoral college. Big, big, big advantage. I've always said the popular vote would be a lot easier than the electoral college. The electoral college  but it's a whole different campaign (unintelligible). The electoral college is very difficult for a Republican to win, and I will tell you, the people want to see it. They want to see the wall, they want to see security. Now, it just came out that they're 73 percent down. ... That's a tremendous achievement. ... Look at this, in 100 days, that down to the lowest in 17 years and it's going lower. Now, people aren't coming because they know they're not going to get through, and there isn't crime. You know the migration up to the border is horrible for women, you know that? (Unintelligible.) Now, much of that's stopped because they can't get through. </TEXT>

But more importantly than him not being a currency manipulator the bigger picture, bigger than even currency manipulation, if he's helping us with North Korea, with nuclear and all of the things that go along with it, who would call, what am I going to do, say, "By the way, would you help us with North Korea? And also, you're a currency manipulator." It doesn't work that way.

<TEXT> Ten times Trump asked [German chancellor Angela Merkel] if he could negotiate a trade deal with Germany. Every time she replied, 'You cant do a trade deal with Germany, only the EU,'" the official said. They continued: "On the eleventh refusal, Trump finally got the message, 'Oh, well do a deal with Europe then.'" Merkel reportedly told her cabinet members that Trump had "very basic misunderstandings" on the "fundamentals" of the EU and trade.

Then they wouldn't comment on their investigation against trump and the Russians because they don't discuss on going investigations. Idk man seems like they are playing politics and were trying to turn the table in Trump's favor  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sen. Ron Wyden has suggested that FBI Director James Comey is using classification to hide information about possible Russian interference in the US election for political reasons, according to The New Yorker.





The Democratic senator from Oregon told the magazine that he's concerned intelligence is becoming politicized.







"My increasing concern is that classification now is being used much more for political security than for national security," Wyden said.






Wyden sent a letter, along with six of his colleagues on the Senate Intelligence Committee, to President Barack Obama three weeks after the election saying the senators "believe there is additional information concerning the Russian Government and the US election that should be declassified and released to the public."





Wyden also pressed Comey on this point during a Congressional hearing in January. Comey said he couldn't discuss the supposed ties between some of President Donald Trump's associates and Russians.








"When a foreign power interferes with American institutions, you don't just say, 'Oh, that's business as usual,' and leave it at that," Wyden told The New Yorker. "There's a historical imperative here, too." </TEXT>

<TEXT> McMaster concluded his study by stating that the Vietnam war was based on deception, and it was lost in Washington, D.C., even before Americans assumed sole responsibility for the fighting in 1965 and before they realized the country was at war; indeed, even before the first American units were deployed.






That McMaster is acutely aware of deceptions role in starting wars is one thing, but that he devoted years to exposing it is a great reflection on McMasters character and worldview presuppositions.






This is very encouraging  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let's look at the evidence:




Paul Manafort was an operative working in Ukraine to install a pro-Russian government.
You worked closely with Paul Manafort for years and own a lobbying firm with him in DC. 

Paul Manafort went missing for several weeks in 2010 (and 2014). This is the same year that the opposition research/dossier claims that Trump began to be cultivated by Moscow. You openly joked that Paul Manafort was kidnapped by the Russians. (See previous links)




Donald Trump began his birtherism allegation in 2011.
Russia hacked Podesta's email account on March 19, 2016.




General Michael Flynn (~Summer 2016) and Carter Page (~March 2016) join the campaign. Both of them have ties to Russia.




Cory Lewandowski was fired from Trumps campaign. Paul Manafort took over. (June 20, 2016)




Trumps position on Russia changed, particularly as it relates to Ukraine. (~ July 18, 2016)




It is discovered that Paul Manafort received an off-the-books 12 million dollar payment from Ukraine. (~August 2016 it is discovered. Payments from 2007-2012.)




The DNC emails hacked by Russia are leaked by WikiLeaks. (July 22, 2016)




Trump invites Russia to hack Hillary Clintons emails. (July 27, 2016) Video proof.




Trump hires Steve Bannon. You and Steve Bannon had a prior relationship. (August 17, 2016) 




Paul Manaforts ties were discovered and he resigned. He continues to live in Trump Tower and advise Donald Trump. (August 19, 2016) 




You tweeted in a way to suggest you had knowledge of the Podesta leaks BEFORE any information about it was released. (August 21, 2016)




Podesta emails hacked by Russia are leaked by WikiLeaks. (October 7, 2016) The leak occurred within a few hours after the Access Hollywood video surfaced.





The United States Intelligence Community formally accuse Russia of hacking the DNC and John Podesta. (October 7, 2016) Trump denies it. Source 2 





Trump won the election. (November 8, 2016) He continued to be soft on Russia.





Trump nominates Rex Tillerson to become the Secretary of State. (December 13, 2016) Tillerson is pro-Russia for business purposes.






The Intelligence Community formally declares that the highest levels of the Kremlin were behind the hacking. (December 2016)





President Obama imposes sanctions on Russia and kicks out 35 Russians diplomats. (December 2016) Putin decides not to immediately retaliate and will wait to see what Donald Trump does after assuming office. (December 2016) Source 2






Declassified Intelligence Report is released with the conclusions of the Intelligence Community.





Buzzfeed publishes 35 page dossier. (January 9, 2017) The dossier was prepared by respected former MI6 spy, Christopher Steele. Before this, Mr. Steele was most popularly known for investigating the corruption at FIFA. He was so frustrated with the FBI's disinterest that he worked for free following the election. He has since gone into hiding. Source 2 Source 3






Trump was briefed on the 35 page dossier by FBI Director Comey.







Trump mocked (and continues to mock) the various Intelligence Agencies in the United States. He sides with Russias response to the dossier. He also praised Wikileaks and Julian Assange. See also Donald Trump's tweets and his January press conference.






Trump finally admits Russia was at fault for hacking, but promises to better relations with Russia. He also indicates that Putin will not hack the US again with Trump as President. Source 2







There is evidence that Michael Flynn called Russias ambassador to the United States on the same day that President Obama announced sanctions and expelled Russian officials. He insists it was unrelated to sanctions. Source 2








I could speculate on Rosneft, but I won't.
These are only some of the reasons that I have to say, respectfully, I don't believe you.






[This comment] (https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5rvt51/im_roger_stone_political_insider_and_longtime/ddakzgo/) goes into detail about why people think trump has ties to Russia.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with that, she was a horrible candidate. But Cambridge analytics was considered a huge success and will be used more going forward. They are honing in there data and it's going to be even more effective in the future. 


All the models had Hillary Clinton winning the presidency, and to date, there has been no satisfactory explanation as to why those models were wrong. A report from the Swiss publication Das Magazin and adapted by Motherboard has a fascinating story about how it might have happened, thanks to Facebook quizzes and a small company called Cambridge Analytica  the same company that worked on the online campaign for Brexit.
The story starts with Michal Kosinski, a psychologist with the Psychometrics Centre at Cambrige University. In 2008, Kosinski and a fellow researcher  both students at the time  were experimenting with Facebook quizzes that zeroed in on what psychologists call The Big Five personality traits: openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism, or OCEAN. The quiz-takers could opt in to sharing their data with the researchers, and to the researchers' surprise, millions did.
Kosinski began correlating this personality data with a person's "likes." From Motherboard:
PLAY DIRTY



DISCOVER
In 2012, Kosinski proved that on the basis of an average of 68 Facebook likes by a user, it was possible to predict their skin color (with 95 percent accuracy) their sexual orientation (88 percent accuracy), and their affiliation to the Democratic or Republican party (85 percent). But it didnt stop there. Intelligence, religion, as well as alcohol, cigarette and drug use, could all be determined. From the data it was even possible to deduce whether deduce whether someone's parents were divorced.
Liking Wu-Tang Clan is one of the best indicators for heterosexuality, Kosinski found, while "liking" Lady Gaga correlated highly with extroversion. Eventually, Facebook made "like" data private, but researchers could still collect it by asking users to opt in. (If you want to try it, you can head over to Kosinskis website applymagicsauce.com.)
So what does all this have to do with elections? In 2014, a young assistant professor named Aleksandr Kogan requested access to Kosinski's database on behalf of an election management agency based in London called Strategic Communications Laboratories. Kosinski turned Kogan down, but Kogan went ahead and registered a company under SCL's umbrella called Cambridge Analytica  an homage, he said, to the university's work in the field. Cambridge Analytica, under CEO Alexander Nix, went on to work for the pro-Brexit campaign, Senator Ted Cruz's presidential nomination bid, and then on Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
On the day of the third presidential debate between Trump and Clinton, Trumps team tested 175,000 different ad variations for his arguments
According to a presentation given by Nix and described by the reporters, Cambridge Analytica took Facebook targeting to a new level.
Up to now, explains Nix, election campaigns have been organized based on demographic concepts. A really ridiculous idea. The idea that all women should receive the same message because of their genderor all African Americans because of their race. What Nix meant is that while other campaigners so far have relied on demographics, Cambridge Analytica was using psychometrics.
Cambridge Analytica used Big Five traits to develop personality-specific messaging, Nix said in the presentation:
For a highly neurotic and conscientious audience the threat of a burglaryand the insurance policy of a gun. An image on the left shows the hand of an intruder smashing a window. The right side shows a man and a child standing in a field at sunset, both holding guns, clearly shooting ducks: Conversely, for a closed and agreeable audience. People who care about tradition, and habits, and family.
Nix also spoke to the reporters:
...Pretty much every message that Trump put out was data-driven, Alexander Nix remembers. On the day of the third presidential debate between Trump and Clinton, Trumps team tested 175,000 different ad variations for his arguments, in order to find the right versions above all via Facebook. The messages differed for the most part only in microscopic details, in order to target the recipients in the optimal psychological way: different headings, colors, captions, with a photo or video. This fine-tuning reaches all the way down to the smallest groups, Nix explained in an interview with us. We can address villages or apartment blocks in a targeted way. Even individuals.
This approach was also used to discourage potential Clinton voters, according to the reporters, and was also used by door-to-door canvassers:
From July 2016, Trump canvassers were provided with an app with which they could identify the political views and personality types of the inhabitants of a house. It was the same app provider used by Brexit campaigners. Trumps people only rang at the doors of houses that the app rated as receptive to his messages. The canvassers came prepared with guidelines for conversations tailored to the personality type of the resident. In turn, the canvassers fed the reactions into the app, and the new data flowed back to the dashboards of the Trump Campaign.
The decision to focus on Michigan and Wisconsin in the final weeks of the campaign was made on the basis of data analysis
This data is what made Trump hone in on specific swing counties, according to the reporters:
The Democrats did similar things, but there is no evidence that they relied on psychometric profiling. Cambridge Analytica, however, divided the US population into 32 personality types, and focused on just 17 states. And just as Kosinski had established that men who like MAC cosmetics are slightly more likely to be gay, the company discovered that a preference for cars made in the US was a great indication of a potential Trump voter. Among other things, these findings now showed Trump which messages worked best and where. The decision to focus on Michigan and Wisconsin in the final weeks of the campaign was made on the basis of data analysis. The candidate became the instrument for implementing a big data model.
After the original German publication of this story, Cambridge Analytica denied that it uses data from Facebook  which contradicts previous statements made by the company  or that it adapted Kosinski's approach.
The power and accuracy of big data tends to be overhyped. When members of Outline staff  admittedly, not a crew that likes a lot of stuff on Facebook  tried Kosinski's site, the results were mixed.
The story, which is worth reading in full, is also inconclusive. It's difficult to tell exactly what impact Cambridge Analytica had on the election, and how much of it was due to Facebook personality targeting. However, the unexpected rise of Cruz during the primaries and his win in Iowa; coupled with Trump's unexpected win and the failure of polls to predict it, supports that conclusion. Either way, we're starting to realize the consequences of giving up so much personal information to Facebook for free. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Russian Defense Ministry has formalized its information-warfare efforts with a dedicated propaganda division, Russian state-run media said on Wednesday, the Associated Press reports.








"Propaganda needs to be clever, smart and efficient," said Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu in reference to the new unit.






But Russia has long been accused of spreading propaganda in the West. Business Insider's Barbara Tasch detailed one case where Russian outlets spread a false story of a Russian-born 13-year-old being raped in Germany by a group of three refugees.








Russia's use of propaganda as an element of "hybrid warfare" proved instrumental during the 2014 annexation of Crimea and the later insurgency in Ukraine.

Since you seem sane compared to others I've interacted with on here maybe you'll read this article about the establishment and trump. Trump has surrounded himself with the dream team of the establishment, they use advanced AI on social media to control the narrative. Google Cambridge analytics if you want to read how effective that is.

<TEXT> There are 2 factions in the government; Democrats and Republicans and the Democratic powers are trying to impeach him and may succeed but the deep state, the ones in charge are the ones he fell in inline with. The Republicans don't want to be associated with him because of all the crazy shit he says but he's doing everything they could possibly want, they will vote his bills thru and won't investigate anything he does. The Republicans are now the powers that be. 

I was a bernie guy that didn't vote for Hillary for the same reason you didn't but just by paying attention to what trump is doing is unsettling. And the media doesn't talk about issues like this article talks about, they hammer home bullshit distraction stories. I think that is by design so we're not paying attention. 

That's my take on it in a nutshell  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good article, haven't really looked at from this angle. Some interesting observations... 


Trumps crack team of money monsters is clearly not planning on acting in the interests of American workersthey will instead do what they know best: use the considerable power of the American state to break down as many regulatory constraints on global banking finance as possible, with a special view to privilege US banks and corporations.


Mike Pompeo is the icing on the cake. As Trumps CIA director, this Republican Congressman has no obvious experience relevant to running a national intelligence agency, except perhaps for one thing: as Jane Mayer writes in her book Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right (Doubleday 2015), Pompeo is so closely entwined with the climate-change denying Koch brothers that he was known as the congressman from Koch.
The Koch brothers, who made their fortune investing in fossil fuels, now have a direct line to Americas premiere national intelligence agency. Now thats what you call a coup.



The Murdoch connection has other alarming ramifications. Since 2010, Murdoch has been an equity-holding board member of the American energy firm, Genie Oil   Gas. He had teamed up with Lord Jacob Rothschild, chairman of Rothschild Investment Trust (RIT) Capital Partners, to buy a 5.5% stake in the corporation then worth $11 million.
Murdoch and Rothschild also serve on Genies strategic advisory board. Joining them on the board are Larry Summers, former Director of President Obamas National Economic Council; former Trump senior advisor James Woolsey; Dick Cheney, former Vice-President under George W. Bush; and Bill Richardson, former Secretary of Energy under Clinton and Governor of New Mexico.


Kissingers critical role in developing Trumps eastward facing strategy was revealed by the German tabloid, Bild, which obtained a document from the Trump transition team. The document confirmed Kissingers role as the key mastermind brought in to craft a way to rebuild relationships with Russia. Kissingers plan would include lifting US economic sanctionspaving the way for a potentially lucrative partnership between American and Russian oil and gas companiesand recognizing Russias ownership of the Crimea.



Perhaps the most powerful takeaway from this examination of who the Trump administration actually is, is that the Trump regime is not external to the Deep State. On the contrary, the people who hold senior posts in his administration, both formal and otherwise, are key nodes that represent whole layers of social and institutional networks within and across the wider US Deep State.
If this is not immediately obvious, its because there is much misunderstanding of what the Deep State actually is. The Deep State is not simply the intelligence community. When a more accurate understanding of the American Deep State and its symbiotic embeddedness in a transnational Deep System is adopted, the role of the Trump faction can be properly discerned.



These motherfuckers are the dream team of corruption and the "deep state" we are in for a bumpy ass ride. I hope people start waking up to what's really going on. 

I also wonder how long his hard liners will make excuses for him and ignore what's actuality going on.

How could you flat out deny that Putin's army of shills would slide these type of topics? Do you know Putin stands to gain 500 billion dollars if sanctions are lifted? You don't think that's enough motivation to change public opinion on the US about Russia? Cmon man, where is your common sense?

<TEXT> Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky on Tuesday suggested he's not sold on the need for investigations into the mounting controversies roiling President Donald Trump's administration.
Paul said in a radio interview on the "Kilmeade and Friends" radio program Tuesday that he didn't think it was prudent to launch "investigation after investigation" on fellow members of the Republican Party.
"I don't think it's useful to be doing investigation after investigation, particularly of your own party," he said.
He continued: "We'll never even get started with doing the things we need to do like repealing Obamacare if we're spending our whole time having Republicans. I think it makes no sense."
Several Republicans in Congress have called for a full inquiry into Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser to Trump. Statements Flynn made about conversations he had with a Russian ambassador before Trump's inauguration ultimately led to his resignation on Monday


How many members of Congress? 535

You don't think they could have more than a couple projects going on at once? Maybe hire a bipartisan investigator? If this shit with trump is true the American people have the right to know  </TEXT>

<TEXT> People who dismiss the idea that Clinton and others privately encouraged Trump to run because they smartly calculated it would create disarray in the GOP (which has indeed happened) and help the Democrats in the long run, are vastly underestimating the brilliance of the Clintons and their inner circle.

The Clintons invented the modern concept of triangulation in Democratic politics (taking the GOP's strongest policy issues and coopting them) and of turning an opponent's supposed strengths into a perceived negative/weakness and then using it as a bludgeon to beat them over the head with.

Karl Rove does this on the GOP side, but the Clintons were so masterful at it that they did it without it even being obvious they were doing it. How many people reading this truly grasp the importance of the fact Clinton took Ronald Reagan and used him as an example of WEAKNESS and FAILURE in the GOP? Not just in messaging to Democrats, mind you, but to the public at large and (most importantly) to independents. And he did it without ever seeming to bash Reagan personally even though he was repudiating the entirety of Reagan's presidency and everyone who claimed it accomplished anything good.

The point is, the Clintons have a more nuanced and complex an understanding of politics and strategy, and of undermining an opponent, than anyone involved in modern politics. Bill Clinton himself could probably sell a fireplace to the Devil, that's how convincing and charismatic he is. He makes people feel like the most important person in the world, and to someone like Trump that would be a pretty powerful political aphrodisiac. Imagine having a former U.S. president -- and one commonly perceived as being among the smartest and most astute -- tell you you should run for president while he fans your ego (and in this theory, imagine you have possibly the biggest and hungriest ego in the galaxy).

Does someone have to KNOW they are a plant, in order to be one? Do you have to realize you're being used as a tool to dismantle a party machine, in order to function effectively as that tool? I say the answer to that is "no." If the Clintons and others secretly worked behind the scenes to convince Trump to run and fed ideas and encouragement to his worst tendencies in order to derail the already-shaky GOP nominating season, and if Trump listened to them and took their advice to heart, then he is functioning pretty effectively as their intended plant.

It doesn't matter if he realizes their motivations or not. He might indeed have been entirely conscious of how and why the Clintons perceived his campaigning as an advantage for them, but he just doesn't agree or just doesn't care so long as (a) it serves his own purposes of expanding his own brand, and (b) he thinks he might actually be smarter than them and able to actually win regardless of what they think. The bottom line is, if they had a plan and took action to implement it, and if so far it's worked out as they hoped and expected, and if Trump's awareness is irrelevant to their plan's success at this point in time, then he's functioning as a plant exactly the same as he would if he were doing all of this intentionally to help them out.

Now, IS it true? Well, I think it's clear Clinton had private conversations with Trump; it's clear Clinton wants to deny and silence any talk of having played a role in Trump's candidacy; it's clear Trump doesn't want anyone to think the conversations were a factor in his decision to run; and it's clear that Trump's campaign has had exactly the same impact it would have if the Clintons had planned it out and encouraged it. So, the outcome is the same as if the theory were true; we know they did in fact meet, which the theory depends on; and we know they want us to stop thinking about it, which is what they'd do and say if the theory were true. None of which proves the theory is true, but it certainly goes a long way to undermining any strong assertions that the theory is absurd or irrational, or that it lacks at least some basic evidence making it interesting to consider and reasonable to think it's at least possible. Calling it ridiculous etc just seems to demonstrate a lack of appreciation for the fact this sort of thing is extremely common in politics, and is extremely consistent with the sort of maneuvering the Clintons are famously capable of thinking up and pulling off effectively while nobody believes it's possible.

Oh, and if you're doubting it based on the claim that Clinton couldn't keep his sex life secret, then I'd just point out that the fact you're aware of some secrets that they didn't keep quiet doesn't mean you're aware of all of the secrets you don't already know about. The severe flaw in the simplistic "the government can't keep secrets" claim is that it relies on the assumption you already know all of the secrets, when in fact if the government has kept secrets then you by definition aren't aware of them yet. Then there are all of the examples of major secrets the government kept for years and decades. More to the point, though, for those who think this theory can't be true because Clinton/the government/etc can't keep secrets -- we're discussing it right here, right now, so obviously it ISN'T a secret anyway, right? Right.

I'll tell you what I think... I think the Clintons got wind Trump was considering another run, they realized it was probably just a minor ego-boosting idea in Trump's head, so Clinton reached out and encouraged Trump, and then also reached out to other people to get THEM to encourage Trump, with the idea Trump would be such a huge disruption he'd draw most of the media attention from other more "serious" GOP contenders while also (very importantly) drawing attention away from the ongoing controversies surrounding Hillary Clinton. Trump's press coverage is dominating all of the election reporting lately, and has done much to stain the GOP's image with independents, moderates, and the two most important voting demographics for the 2016 election -- Latino voters and women voters.

So I don't for a second believe Clinton was talking with Trump and that those discussions never touched on the election, and that it's a coincidence Trump decided to make a big run for the nomination. Coincidences like this, and the way it's played out, don't just "happen" when the Clintons are involved in an election, folks.

Trump agreeing to run after being influenced by Clinton and others doesn't remotely require him to have the intended purpose of harming the GOP nor of helping the Democrats, by the way. Clinton wouldn't have to approach Trump by asking him outright to derail the GOP, nor would Clinton suggest, "Hey Trump, you'd be so awful you'd make the public hate the GOP, so would you run?" He'd probably point to all of Trump's strengths as a candidate, the way certain policy positions and "plain talk" would rally the GOP base around Trump, how there are no really strong personalities in the GOP field at this time who can compete with Trump's personality, and how the outcome is a huge boon for Trump whether he gets the nomination or not since it will vastly increase Trump's personal brand and put him in a much stronger bargaining position for future TV shows and media deals. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A key Hillary Clinton aide at the State Department performed work for the Clinton Foundation, CNN reported Thursday.

Cheryl Mills interviewed job candidates for the Clinton Foundation while working as Clintons chief of staff at State, the report said.


Clinton and her familys charitable foundation agreed to a set of rules once she became secretary of State in 2009. The guidelines were meant to ensure the foundations activities would not create conflicts or the appearance of conflicts for Senator Clinton as secretary of State.
Mills traveled to New York City in June 2012 and interviewed two high-level business executives for a prominent position at the Clinton Foundation, CNN reported. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Test results indicate that the RF resonant cavity thruster design, which is unique as an electric propulsion device, is producing a force that is not attributable to any classical electromagnetic phenomenon and therefore is potentially demonstrating an interaction with the quantum vacuum virtual plasma

That works on the same principle of Tesla's patent of Resonant Frequency Generator / Kapanadze </TEXT>

<TEXT> 
You are about to read a list of 45 goals that found their way down the halls of our great Capitol back in 1963. As you read this, 39 years later, you should be shocked by the events that have played themselves out. I first ran across this list 3 years ago but was unable to attain a copy and it has bothered me ever since. Recently, Jeff Rense posted it on his site and I would like to thank him for doing so. http://www.rense.com
 
Communist Goals (1963) Congressional Record--Appendix, pp. A34-A35 January 10, 1963
 
Current Communist Goals EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. A. S. HERLONG, JR. OF FLORIDA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 10, 1963 .
 
Mr. HERLONG. Mr. Speaker, Mrs. Patricia Nordman of De Land, Fla., is an ardent and articulate opponent of communism, and until recently published the De Land Courier, which she dedicated to the purpose of alerting the public to the dangers of communism in America.
 
At Mrs. Nordman's request, I include in the RECORD, under unanimous consent, the following "Current Communist Goals," which she identifies as an excerpt from "The Naked Communist," by Cleon Skousen:
 
[From "The Naked Communist," by Cleon Skousen]
 
1. U.S. acceptance of coexistence as the only alternative to atomic war.
 
2. U.S. willingness to capitulate in preference to engaging in atomic war.
 
3. Develop the illusion that total disarmament [by] the United States would be a demonstration of moral strength.
 
4. Permit free trade between all nations regardless of Communist affiliation and regardless of whether or not items could be used for war.
 
5. Extension of long-term loans to Russia and Soviet satellites.
 
6. Provide American aid to all nations regardless of Communist domination.
 
7. Grant recognition of Red China. Admission of Red China to the U.N.
 
8. Set up East and West Germany as separate states in spite of Khrushchev's promise in 1955 to settle the German question by free elections under supervision of the U.N.
 
9. Prolong the conferences to ban atomic tests because the United States has agreed to suspend tests as long as negotiations are in progress.
 
10. Allow all Soviet satellites individual representation in the U.N.
 
11. Promote the U.N. as the only hope for mankind. If its charter is rewritten, demand that it be set up as a one-world government with its own independent armed forces. (Some Communist leaders believe the world can be taken over as easily by the U.N. as by Moscow. Sometimes these two centers compete with each other as they are now doing in the Congo.)
 
12. Resist any attempt to outlaw the Communist Party.
 
13. Do away with all loyalty oaths.
 
14. Continue giving Russia access to the U.S. Patent Office.
 
15. Capture one or both of the political parties in the United States.
 
16. Use technical decisions of the courts to weaken basic American institutions by claiming their activities violate civil rights.
 
17. Get control of the schools. Use them as transmission belts for socialism and current Communist propaganda. Soften the curriculum. Get control of teachers' associations. Put the party line in textbooks.
 
18. Gain control of all student newspapers.
 
19. Use student riots to foment public protests against programs or organizations which are under Communist attack.
 
20. Infiltrate the press. Get control of book-review assignments, editorial writing, policy-making positions.
 
21. Gain control of key positions in radio, TV, and motion pictures.
 
22. Continue discrediting American culture by degrading all forms of artistic expression. An American Communist cell was told to "eliminate all good sculpture from parks and buildings, substitute shapeless, awkward and meaningless forms."
 
23. Control art critics and directors of art museums. "Our plan is to promote ugliness, repulsive, meaningless art."
 
24. Eliminate all laws governing obscenity by calling them "censorship" and a violation of free speech and free press.
 
25. Break down cultural standards of morality by promoting pornography and obscenity in books, magazines, motion pictures, radio, and TV.
 
26. Present homosexuality, degeneracy and promiscuity as "normal, natural, healthy."
 
27. Infiltrate the churches and replace revealed religion with "social" religion. Discredit the Bible and emphasize the need for intellectual maturity, which does not need a "religious crutch."
 
28. Eliminate prayer or any phase of religious expression in the schools on the ground that it violates the principle of "separation of church and state."
 
29. Discredit the American Constitution by calling it inadequate, old-fashioned, out of step with modern needs, a hindrance to cooperation between nations on a worldwide basis.
 
30. Discredit the American Founding Fathers. Present them as selfish aristocrats who had no concern for the "common man."
 
31. Belittle all forms of American culture and discourage the teaching of American history on the ground that it was only a minor part of the "big picture." Give more emphasis to Russian history since the Communists took over.
 
32. Support any socialist movement to give centralized control over any part of the culture--education, social agencies, welfare programs, mental health clinics, etc.
 
33. Eliminate all laws or procedures which interfere with the operation of the Communist apparatus.
 
34. Eliminate the House Committee on Un-American Activities.
 
35. Discredit and eventually dismantle the FBI.
 
36. Infiltrate and gain control of more unions.
 
37. Infiltrate and gain control of big business.
 
38. Transfer some of the powers of arrest from the police to social agencies. Treat all behavioral problems as psychiatric disorders which no one but psychiatrists can understand [or treat].
 
39. Dominate the psychiatric profession and use mental health laws as a means of gaining coercive control over those who oppose Communist goals.
 
40. Discredit the family as an institution. Encourage promiscuity and easy divorce.
 
41. Emphasize the need to raise children away from the negative influence of parents. Attribute prejudices, mental blocks and retarding of children to suppressive influence of parents.
 
42. Create the impression that violence and insurrection are legitimate aspects of the American tradition; that students and special-interest groups should rise up and use ["]united force["] to solve economic, political or social problems.
 
43. Overthrow all colonial governments before native populations are ready for self-government.
 
44. Internationalize the Panama Canal.
 
45. Repeal the Connally reservation so the United States cannot prevent the World Court from seizing jurisdiction [over domestic problems. Give the World Court jurisdiction] over nations and individuals alike.
 
Note by Webmaster: The Congressional Record back this far has not be digitized and posted on the Internet.
 
It will probably be available at your nearest library that is a federal repository. Call them and ask them. Your college library is probably a repository. This is an excellent source of government records. Another source are your Congress Critters. They should be more than happy to help you in this matter. You will find the Ten Planks of the Communist Manifesto interesting at this point.
 
Webmaster Forest Glen Durland found the document in the library. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am a avid smoker and former extacy user, I also deal with depression/anxiety . 

I am able to use weed to help with motivation and provoke a self awareness that I would never have achieved otherwise. I belive if you use it in small doses and think of it as a medicine instead of a narcotic you can achieve great results with it. 

I personally will not do extacy again. It amplifies my depression and puts me in a haze for at least a week after dosing it. 

In your case you probably don't want to use any drug to escape feelings that you might not want to deal with. You will have a good chance of getting into harder drugs to escape.  </TEXT>
