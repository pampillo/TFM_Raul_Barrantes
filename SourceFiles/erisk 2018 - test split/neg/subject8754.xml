<TEXT> Seems like it doesn't really matter. Whatever you can overclock it to it'll still drop back down to 2025MHz when gaming. Even across other OEMs 2025MHz seems to be the maximum clock 1080 Tis are willing to stay at when gaming. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Haven't tried the beta Afterburner but after hearing your experience with it, I probably should wait till a more stable version is released. 

And I realized I've been an idiot. When I said +200 on memory it's actually +400 since Afterburner doesn't show the Double Data Rates. I've managed to get a stable +85 on Core and +210 (2) on Memory without overvolting now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No in my BIOS settings there's override and there's offset. Auto seems to make overclock unstable (unless you meant for the VDROOP offset?). I'm using IntelBurnTest. 

I can't really be bothered to run long stability tests since it heats up my room too much (31 degrees ambient room temp). If it doesn't crash in games, encoding or in daily use its good enough.  </TEXT>

Is the LLC option the same as VDROOP Offset Control? I have it on auto now and it seems too aggressive. I've tried setting it to 12.5% (the lowest I can go, there is no disable), but it's pushing core voltage even higher than when left at auto. </TEXT>

Everything runs smoothly and doesn't crash but when I check HWMonitor/HWiNFO, the CPU VCore actually shoots up to 1.296V when running IntelBurnTest. How can I prevent this? </TEXT>

Even without overvolting, the GPU hits 84C in Unigine's Superposition. I guess I shouldn't overvolt (my room temperature is 31C). </TEXT>

It already has very good cooling. There's a fan directly beneath the GPU for more airflow. And then there's two on the front of the case not that far away. Should I try overvolting? </TEXT>

Edit: it's only downclocking in benchmarks. I'm using an overclock of +80 on core and +400 on memory at stock. Funny thing is that +250, +300 crashes, but not at +400.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just got a new 1080 Ti and I'm trying to get custom resolutions working.  

I have two 17" monitors with a native resolution of 1280x1024. My goal is to run them at 1440x1152 rotated to match my 27" 1440p monitor on both sides. The one using a DVI-DVI cable does 1440x1152 perfectly using NVIDIA Control Panel.  

However, the other monitor using a DVI-DVI-HDMI (Converter) refuses to do 1440x1152. NVIDIA says test failed, custom resolution is not supported by your display.  

Funny thing is, that exact monitor was doing 1440x1152 for the past year on my old GPU (970), but on a DVI-DVI cable.  

Is there some kind of restriction on what cables/ports are supported for custom resolutions? It's a shame my 1080 Ti only has one DVI input. </TEXT>

I can't get my third monitor working. It's connected via a DVI-D to DisplayPort cable (DisplayPort on GPU). Windows and everything on Windows detects the display but the monitor won't turn on. I can even set to extend desktop to the display but again nothing is actually shown.

**Describe your problem. List any error messages and symptoms. Be descriptive.**

I don't know if my PSU is starting to fail, but here are some problems related to starting it. Sometimes after pressing the on button, it takes 10s before the computer starts. 

Twice, after I've gone on a 2 week long holiday, the computer fails to boot but power cycles. The power LED will turn on for a few seconds (with fans and everything on), and then shut down again by itself, before trying to start again. This happens over and over and seems to resolve itself randomly after a few hours. Opening the case up and toggling the PSU on and off doesn't seem to help. It just works randomly. After successfully starting, it's fine until the next stint of not being turned on for 1 week. 

Are these problems symptomatic of PSU failure, or motherboard issues?

<TEXT> I wonder if any of you love (western) classical operas like I do. It's disappointing that we don't get much of an opportunity to enjoy this genre of music here in Singapore. The SLO always plays *Cosi Fan Tutte* but not more exciting (if I may say so) ones like *The Marriage of Figaro* or *La Traviata*. It's so exciting for me to have had the opportunity to watch the former in Vienna. If only we could enjoy more of such amazing works here.  </TEXT>

Those that deny Gods revelations shall be sternly punished; God is mighty and capable of revenge (3:5)

Those that deny Our revelation We will burn in fire. No sooner will their skins be consumed than We shall give them other skins, so that they may truly taste the scourge. God is mighty and wise (4:5556).

<TEXT> Thanks for answering. I know it officially runs at 1280x1024 but I'm wondering whether it'll still work properly when a higher 1440x1152 is forced onto it. Some monitors just say input signal out of range while others handle it just fine.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know this is strange, but I'm really trying very hard to find a good condition Lenovo L171p Monitor (5:4) for my PC setup. It's quite hard to find any online; those that I found were Grade C refurbished while Amazon lists another for US$100+. That's my last resort but I'll appreciate it if any of you know where to get one of this. I think this model was quite popular with businesses and corporations.

As to the why, I currently run a 27" 1440p monitor with an existing L171p (in portrait @ 1152x1440) on the right. I want another L171p on the left at the same resolution for some of my simulation games (so that total resolution is 4864x1440). </TEXT>

<TEXT> My parents both moved from HK to Singapore to become citizens in the late '80s. I think it's easier to live a more comfortable live here because of the lower population density and housing prices. Even driving here is better because there's no 2-hour traffic jams. 


For me personally, I'll never move to HK because of the unstable political environment (it's China after all) and high prices of housing there. Their flats are ridiculously small (~200-300sqft are common) and everywhere you look there's people. It's way too overcrowded there but if you studied in Singapore and can speak Cantonese, there are plenty of good paying jobs waiting since our English 'proficiency' is much better than theirs.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't misunderstand you. I'm saying to introduce reassessment after the buyer has purchased the HDB. 

Okay, the HDB owner is the legal owner, but I'm not saying asking them to leave without compensation, like a repossession. I'm saying get them to pay back the subsidised amount or find a new private home to move to. 

As a taxpayer, I don't want my money to go to people who are perhaps even richer than me, just because they live in a different type of housing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The point of the COE system was to make cars prohibitively expensive to reduce their numbers on the road. So if HDB dwellers choose to use their subsidies to pay the extra taxes on cars, it's quite counterintuitive. 


Maybe it seems unfair to force someone to leave, but perhaps pay back the subsidies granted since they can afford it now? It's unfair to other taxpayers who continually have to fork out to subsidise those who don't need it. An example I can think of is the GST vouchers and the utilities rebate. I live in a condo, but there are many who live in HDBs with higher incomes. They get the vouchers and rebates, I don't.  </TEXT>

And I don't agree with what you said about HK. Over the past few years, I've spent upwards of 2 months and above in HK every year and there are absolutely no free Wifi hotspots other than at Starbucks. All the others are run by telcos and require payment. There's a free tourist trial but I used it once 4 years ago and it hasn't reset until now. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I tried overclocking the 4790K in the past and it would just crash all the time. Even applying stock voltage (~1.28V) at stock clocks was unstable. The only solution was to leave everything at Auto. 

A week ago, I was looking through all the CPU options and discovered that 'Enhanced Turbo' in the MSI UEFI settings was on Auto. I disabled it and now I've been running a 4.6GHz overclock at 1.261V without much problems! 

IntelBurnTest (10 runs) is done in 124 seconds (~122 GFlops), although temps can hit 95C. But that's just because my Noctua CPU fans max out at 1100rpm. Other than that, in everyday use, it doesn't exceed 75C, which I think is okay with a 31C room temperature.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Quietest keyboard? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-29 10:26:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My current Logitech keyboard has served me well for the past 3 years but the keys are suddenly starting to jam up. Tried cleaning them but it doesn't seem to help.

I'm looking for a new keyboard that's extra quiet. I don't really like keys with long travel either. Basically, I like laptop keyboards. Is there something like that, but full-sized with a numpad? I don't need special function keys. 

The HP Wireless Elite Keyboard v2 looks about right. Any ideas whether that's any good or do you guys have other suggestions?

Edit: Thanks for all the suggestions. I honestly dislike the feeling of mechanical keyboards, so I don't think I'll consider those at all.  </TEXT>

**Describe your problem. List any error messages and symptoms. Be descriptive.**

My system is sometimes restarting on its own during gaming. I thought this was a CPU overclock problem, so I disabled it. My GPUs run a mild overclock, but I think this isn't the problem since the drivers usually crash, but not the entire system right? Is this a sign of a PSU problem?

**List anything you've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem.**

Disabled CPU overclock, updated the BIOS, updated GPU drivers, ran MemTest.

He said that their population are dumb and gullible so it's easy to make a fortune there. He mentioned how every few months they'll repackage their medical ointment as another brand claiming to provide additional benefits, and people will flock to buy it. Rinse and repeat.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did and there's not much of a difference. Everything's slightly faster. I like the new home button but the camera's been a disappointment. The noise reduction is way too aggressive.

Wished that Apple went with a touch-sensitive activation like with the jailbreak tweak VirtualHome instead. That means one tap: home button; two taps: reachability.

<TEXT> Hi, my car has an Android infotainment system running 2.3.7 (yes, can't update that) based off the Parrot Asteroid Smart. It's rooted and I used to use an app called Market Helper to change the device identifier to access the Google Play Store. I don't know what I did, but in the recent weeks I can't access the Play Store anymore. I tried changing it back to default in Market Helper and it gives me a 'No Android ID found' error. 

Trying to access Play Store will throw up an error saying 'Server Error' will pop up. I've tried clearing the Play Store cache, clearing the Google Framework cache, removing the Google Account and re-adding it, but to no avail.

As a last-ditch attempt, I removed the Play Store and the Google Framework and reinstalled them by gaining root access. Now the Google Account is removed. I tried re-adding my account but it says during the account login process that it 'Can't establish a reliable connection to the server'. I searched around and found that a common solution was to edit the etc/hosts file but that wasn't the problem. Any ideas? </TEXT>

And yes, only Indians have some weird propensity to wash wooden fittings with water hoses. I've rented out to Indonesians, a Japanese, a French, an Australian and Mainland Chinese, and none of them have done the same thing, while the 4 Indian families I've rented to did. You think the safety deposit is enough to cover the damages? You'll be lucky if they actually complete their contract before their employers terminate their contracts and ship them back to India. </TEXT>

And I'm sure the tendering process would have been vigorous, and that CSR SiFang must have satisfied the minimum requirements to have won the contract. It's not like the government wanted to trains to be defective. The trains would have been delivered free of cracks too. In any case, aren't they being repaired now, under warranty. Other than Khaw being silly and saying Harakiri once in a while, what's really the big deal?

And do you really trust the HK media with their extreme pro-democracy and anti-China rhetoric? They'll pounce on anything negative that can be linked to Leung Chun-Ying or the CCP. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know why this happens to me. I can't play more than 20 minutes of ETS2 without falling asleep, no matter the time of day. I can be wide awake in the morning but a little bit of ETS2 will get me drifting off to sleep. This never happens in real life when I drive, and I've driven for more than 4 hours straight while tired at 10pm. I don't even fall asleep easily at other times. 

Anyone with similar experiences? </TEXT>

I've heard of multiple stories from my mates during NS of people going through ITE and ending up in University. It's definitely possible to move up the social echelon with dedication and hard work. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The E-class is around $270,000 when it was $240,000 a few years back. I think it'll just increase again when the newer generation arrives. Using your example, with a combined income of $14,000 (assuming after-taxes), monthly payment for an E-Class at 2.68% for 6 years 70% loan is $2800+. That's exactly 20%. So I'm guessing people who buy the E-class is earning around that ballpark? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree that it is a religion of violence. Here's just some verses from the Quran:


[We] shall let them live awhile, and then shall drag them to the scourge of the Fire. Evil shall be their fate (2:126)
Slay them wherever you find them. Drive them out of the places from which they drove you. ...Fight against them until idolatry is no more and Gods religion reigns supreme. But if they desist, fight none except the evil-doers(2:19093)
Fighting is obligatory for you, much as you dislike it. But you may hate a thing although it is good for you, and love a thing although it is bad for you. God knows, but you know not (2:216)
" whoever of you recants and dies an unbeliever, his works shall come to nothing in this world and in the world to come. Such men shall be the tenants of Hell, wherein they shall abide forever.  (2:21718)
Those that deny Gods revelations shall be sternly punished; God is mighty and capable of revenge (3:5)
We will put terror into the hearts of the unbelievers. . . . The Fire shall be their home (3:14951)
Those that deny Our revelation We will burn in fire. No sooner will their skins be consumed than We shall give them other skins, so that they may truly taste the scourge. God is mighty and wise (4:5556).
[T]hose that deny Our revelations shall be punished for their misdeeds (6:49) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Usually short trips are terrible for fuel economy as I spend 10 minutes or so in the condo carpark waiting to exit into heavy traffic. Then there's this 2-minute long wait at a red light. A usual 4km trip I do every Sunday gives me a grand total of 14L/100km! 

That 3.9L/100km record was driving at around 70-80km/h for the first half then at around 110km/h for the second half and then 30-40km/h (ruins fuel economy) for the last 2kms or so. Can't use Cruise Control because there's too many idiots hogging the road. 

I should try 80km/h all the way where the car displays around 2.4L/100km. </TEXT>

I'm getting massive performance gains over my friend's PC with near identical specs except for a single 980. I only play AAA games which are sure to be optimized for SLI and driving simulators which from experience, work very well with SLI. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's no real need to take exams if you're not planning to teach in the future. I took years of piano lessons and completed Grade 8 ABRSM for both Practical and Theory but that wasn't fun. Usually piano lessons don't really teach you to play pieces that you like, but rather just focusing on the three exam pieces. It's very repetitive and you'll get tired of it quickly. Why not just continue learning on your own? Maybe buying those books for scales will help with developing your technique.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Best smartphone dashcam mount? </TITLE>

<TEXT> Hi I'm using a Xiaomi Redmi 2 as a dashcam and have been having troubles with finding a good mount for it. I've used a suction type (suction cups on the phone) but the phone keeps falling off. I've got a new one with the clip/claw type and that's very good except that the ball mount causes a lot of vibrations. I've tightened the 'lock' as tight as possible but it becomes loose after a while. Can any of you recommend a good smartphone mount that can be locked tightly so that vibrations are kept to a minimum? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really have no clue about questioning a minor so if it is indeed what you say, then the police have done wrong in questioning him. But I don't think this is the current point of contention in the investigation.

I think I may not have conveyed my second point clearly. What I'm trying to say is more of why blame the system at all for his personal decision? So what if he was affected by the questioning? Plenty of people are questioned by the police everyday and they don't commit suicide. Isn't this more of a case of him being too fragile and impulsive? Is this more of a concern of 'police investigations should not lead to people committing suicide'? Because to me, suicide or not, so be it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is it legally not allowed for a minor to be questioned by the police? He's 14, not 7, for goodness' sake. And him committing suicide has nothing to do with SOP. I don't think that it is reasonably foreseeable by any one in that situation that he will jump. Why blame SOPs for his own mental susceptibilities? 

Well of course it's not justified for someone to die because he molested somebody. It's not the case here anyway since that statement suggests that it was not in his own free will that he decided to commit suicide, when in fact it was so. The boy chose to end his life, perhaps of guilt, but no one forced him to. It's more of a tragedy that he wasn't brought up correctly to prevent everything that led to his end from happening in the first place. </TEXT>

If they want to take that kid away, I don't think you will be telling the police, "Hey wait, I need to ask for his parents' permission first". That's just silly.

I would believe that this is what a logical person would do to not interfere with the police and their investigation (not justice as you mentioned). </TEXT>

I don't think it's that common to think about entrusting a school about priorities and whatnot, but rather just sending a child to school for the sake of learning. In any case, what did the principal do wrong? Isn't it obstruction of justice if he prevented the police from taking the boy away?

<TEXT> I feel that the flipped learning model is just a lazy excuse to let the professors do less. It's getting closer and closer to being largely self-study now, so you're just paying for the exams.

1) The videos they use for e-learning were prepared years ago and just reused. Some lecturers don't even bother to hide the fact that the slides were made years ago. Loads of errors not corrected over the years. If I wanted to learn online, why not watch free lectures from Harvard instead of paying for NTU's?

2) Only one was held in the hive. Not much group discussions unless it's business law. I don't know how you can active discuss Accounting or something similar.

3) Yes, 1 tutor per class. No wonder the tuition fees are so much cheaper compared to overseas universities. The larger class size does nothing to enhance learning since people don't participate even with participation counted in the final grade. There's less personal attention given by professors in such large classes since he/she can't wait for 1 person to understand while holding the rest of the 49 students up.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> From NTU Business. Lots of projects and presentations but there's fewer and fewer physical lectures to attend. NTU's going forward with the trend of e-learning, which to me is a total rip-off. I would also complain about the huge tutorial class sizes, which can go up to 50 students per class. Exams are not too difficult and you don't really have to mug to do well. Just keep up with the readings and do the tutorials and you should be good for exams.

Since the time table's quite sparse and there's a lot of e-learning, pass your time either by joining a CCA or just relax at home. JC was much more hectic than Uni is now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay. That makes sense on how it's 'giving in' sometimes. 

For me, personally, there isn't really much that I'm dissatisfied with in Singapore, other than NS. But that's over now, after having served my 2 years. I don't really care what they do about that anymore.

I really have no statistics on the support for death penalty here but from my personal experience and interaction (which by no means represent any significant portion of the general consensus), most people are in support of it.

And yes, I do believe in eugenics, but that's so politically incorrect that I'm not going to speak about it here. I still care about Reddit karma as a Singaporean who wants to save 'face'. 

What was wrong with Carnegie and Beethoven? And please don't put Steve Jobs in that list. I don't see why he's so great. He's just fantastic at marketing. He's a terrible person in general and I can't respect anyone who believes in homoeopathy. I own an iPhone, but I never liked him as a person. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was checking my tyre pressures today and realised that after the last dealership service, they overinflated it to Front 280kPa and Rear 270kPa, which explains the unusually harsh ride. I got it back down to 220/210 which were the recommended comfort pressures. Ride comfort improved tremendously; squeaks from going over harsh road irregularities were entirely gone. 


This got me thinking, what's the lowest tyre pressure that's still safe to commute daily on to maximize ride quality? The lowest my tyres have gone was around 185kPa from not pumping them up for about 3 months, and by that time the ride was exceptionally smooth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So does the US have a higher COx allowance than the EU? I feel that a standardized emission standard will help to alleviate some of these problems.

Isn't the CO poisoning only an issue with very old cars? I've read that since the introduction of catalytic converters, this problem shouldn't be much of an issue unless there's an exhaust leakage. Unless such cars are common in the US?

I live in Singapore, miles away from any emissions saga. The only interesting thing that is happening is a VW owner suing VW Singapore over the emissions scandal, wanting VW to buy back the car. It's technically possible since VW Singapore is not a dealership but a direct 'branch' of VW Germany. Living there means I'm safe from any natural disasters, although I experience an outage about 14 years ago, for about half an hour I think. So no experience with power generators whatsoever. </TEXT>

I'm guessing one solution to exceeding NOx levels would be to have an extremely hot combustion temperature (to produce more NOx and lower COx) and use AdBlue to counter the NOx? I think that's what Citron and Mercedes are doing for their diesels? From what I've read NOx wasn't really a concern for the EU because they are not greenhouse gases. Are COx bad for our respiratory systems like NOx? </TEXT>

<TEXT> From what I hear from local and foreign bank's HR here:

Australia: Easy to get in. Singaporeans go there because they can't get into a local Uni (many of my JC classmates did this). Singaporean foundation will make you a top scorer. Not great degrees.

US: Really depends on where you go. UCLA, MIT, Harvard are obviously very good. But places like University of Phoenix are rubbish.

UK: Oxford, Cambridge are obviously good. Glasgow and Manchester are places you go to if you can't make it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> PES E but got to fire the SAR21 during a cohesion. Never fired any other gun before so these are just general observations. It's quite light and the recoil is really very impressive. It's quite silent too, but the thing jams all the time. Got to fire 10 bullets but then it got stuck on the 7th. The instructor at MMRC couldn't fix it so had to forgo the last 3 bullets. I hope if ever we go to war these things don't jam so often. Was fun anyway.  </TEXT>

European trucks are about efficiency, I don't think brands like MB or MAN wants their old trucks with laughable engine outputs to be represented in-game. Getting a licence only entitles SCS to certain models, not all trucks from the same brand; maybe rigids aren't ready yet because of licencing issues. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Cheap and Good Android phone for use as In-Car DVR? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-02 10:43:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi, I'm based in Singapore and am looking for a cheap (US$200) Android phone to replace the current XiaoMi Redmi 2 for use in my car as a Digital Video Recorder. I currently record using Background Video Recorder 2 and also simultaneously use Torque Pro to record OBD2 logs from a connected bluetooth OBD2 reader. 

The current phone is crashing randomly and lags at recording video. In addition, the GPS doesn't work when recording video, a bug that XiaoMi refuses to acknowledge or fix despite numerous reports from different users. As such, I am looking to replace that heap of junk. 

I would prefer an Android phone with a newish version of Android (5.0+), expandable storage, support for ExFAT (important) or basically writing of video files 4GB, minimum 30FPS 1080p video recording (60 FPS preferred, constant frame rate even better). Optical image stabilization would be amazing to have but not necessary. Battery life must also be reasonably good to last at least 1.5h of recording videos between charges. Is this too much to ask for in a low-end phone?

I don't mind recommendations for used phones. Please, pick an Android for me. </TEXT>

While it was fun and all, it was really tiring and stressful in traffic. I had the constant pressure of not stalling and looking like an idiot. I think it was quite lucky of me not to get honked at by Parisian taxis when I finally did stall. I think automatics are better for daily driving, it's just that much smoother, unless it's a dry-clutch DCT.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> First time overclocking </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi, I've recently noticed that the automatic overclocking feature on my PC's motherboard has been causing quite a bit of instability. I have turned it off and I'm trying to overclock it manually now. It's running an i7-4790K and I've got it running at 4.5GHz on all cores and up turbo boost to 5GHz at 1.205V. It's stable enough for video encoding, Realbench and Cinebench but not Prime95. I'm wondering if I should tinker with the Ring Ratio and Ring Voltage? They are still set to Auto. I will be happy with 4.6GHz at around the same voltages as the CPU's maxing out at 75C now.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Haha I had a great time. Traffic's a bit boring on the autoroutes but I thought the country roads were quite fun. Not needing to care much about being polite in Paris was fun too, especially when zipping around other cars. What surprised me the most was the number of very elderly drivers. I witnessed so many of them nearly get into accidents at the local Carrefour. What worries me is if they ever get on the autoroutes... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi I would just like to share my experience of driving for the first time in Europe. It's been a really stressful and scary experience. Kudos to all you guys out there who have no qualms going at 130km/h in absolute darkness (or even faster if you're driving a BMW). Where I'm from there's not a single road without street lamps and experiencing country roads at 90km/h at 10pm is really something. 

I think I've learnt my lesson to not rent a tiny city car again and expect to cruise at 130km/h. Hearing the engine screaming at 3800rpm wasn't something I wanted to do on long journeys. It could do 170km/h on a downhill though. 

I wonder what kind of MPGs and revs your car does at that speed?  </TEXT>

There's this bus I used to take everyday, a brand new Scania, and the driver revs it till 2500rpm (the limiter) before changing gears. In 2 months he has ruined the gearbox, and now he just skips 3rd gear. Poor engine has to do this for another 20 years. Companies here should buy automatics to save on fuel and maintenance costs. I don't think driving at above 2000rpm is going to be fuel efficient for a diesel at all.  </TEXT>

My topic post does suggest that my theory might be influenced by confirmation bias, as you've suggested as all I've got is anecdotal evidence. I'm quite interested in finding this out, especially for GE2015, but I don't think I'll have the necessary time, resources, energy to coordinate an in-depth research on this. Maybe if I was doing a PhD in sociology or political science, but it's a shame that I'm doing something entirely unrelated.

<TEXT> Hmm I don't quite agree with the segmentation of income levels. $7k and below seem to consist entirely of the lower and lower-middle classes since the median monthly household income in 2011 was $7037. The representation here for the middle-upper and upper classes seem to be unfairly lumped together in the survey. I'm quite sure there's quite a difference between $7k, $15k and $30k/month.

It's interesting how you mentioned Cheo Chai Chen and CSJ. It seems like social media did in fact play a large role in the elections, contrary to what the media analysts have agreed on.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wouldn't agree entirely with 'regardless'. I think one's income does shape attitudes and beliefs. I have friends from the lower income level and it's quite obvious from their sentiments that they felt that more help can be provided to them and the PAP isn't doing enough for them. Upper class individuals however, lament the rising income taxes and are worried that the opposition's welfare policies are going to translate into even higher taxes in the future. They simply don't care about GST Vouchers, HDB grants, increased income limits for HDBs, better public transport and other types of social spending because they are unable to enjoy many of these schemes. So I would say income levels may not translate to a 'YES' for PAP, but do play a large part in translating to a 'NO' for the opposition. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like the opposition should work on not alienating the middle-upper and upper classes of society. All the talk about minimum wage, nationalizing public transport, and changes to the education system are things that the above-mentioned classes don't really care about. They don't stand to gain from the minimum wage schemes, they don't take public transport to care about nationalizing it and they can afford to send their children wherever they want.

On the other hand, things like increasing the income taxes to drive more welfare measures, grants and rebates are just some of the things this group of people don't want to hear. One reason why I think many amongst the middle-upper classes voted for the PAP is because they are worried about the increased tax rates if the opposition's welfare plans were implemented. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Does income level correlate with votes for the PAP </TITLE>

<TEXT> I'm not very sure if this is just a result of confirmation bias or if this effect is actually true. It seems to me that areas with a higher median income level means a larger proportion of votes for the PAP. Holland-Bukit Timah, for example, seems to indicate a strong correlation between income and percentage of PAP votes. Aljunied, with a generally lower income level because of the number of retirees in Bedok, led to higher percentage of votes for the WP. I can't explain MacPherson though; it isn't a high income area but vote percentage for PAP was quite high. Maybe this has to do with the strength of the opposition there too. 

Personally, as a non-HDB dweller in Aljunied, I sided with PAP as I did not identify with WP's policies on minimum wage and increased social security. To me, I wouldn't stand to benefit from any of those handouts or minimum wage policies, although the same can be said about the GST vouchers or U-Save rebates from PAP. I wonder if the same sentiment is shared with other middle-upper class voters? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Call it elitist or whatever, but we do need bright people to lead our country. Democracy for the sake of democracy will ruin our future. Sometimes the people aren't always right. Think about it, do you think the average voter has enough financial knowledge and expertise compared to Tharman to decide what's good for the country? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hmm seems true. The town council thing just made me lose confidence in WP. And the way they addressed the issue was just irresponsible. 

Edit: Just to add, I think the number of new condos around the Bedok Reservoir has got to do with a higher percentage of votes for PAP.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't vote because I was born 2 months too late but let me share why my parents voted for the PAP. We didn't like the idea of implementing a minimum wage. We ARE affected by the AHPETC saga. We didn't identify with the more socialist policies that the WP is trying to push for. We didn't agree with giving out money to people unnecessarily as we personally never ever qualify for any of them. We don't like LTK because he doesn't speak well in Parliament and honestly seems like a random taxi driver who rambles on about the government's policies without suggesting any good alternatives. These are just some of the reasons. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see more of the latter, TBH. I was expecting much less support for the WP with the AHPETC saga and the call for minimum wage. I wonder if there's a direct correlation between income groups and voting preferences. It seems to me, without any real statistical analyses, that lower income areas would result in higher opposition votes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi guys, I've just completed my SG$3000 desktop built for gaming and here are some pictures:

http://imgur.com/a/I5HNY

These are the specs:

Type|Item
:----|:----
Case | Fractal Design Define R5
PSU | Seasonic X Series 850W
Motherboard | MSI Z97 Gaming 5
CPU | Intel i7-4790K
GPU | 2x MSI GTX970 4GB Gaming GDDR5
CPU Cooler | CORSAIR H110 Hydro Series
Additional Case Fan | Corsair AF120 Quiet Edition
SSD | Samsung 840 EVO 500GB
HDD | Western Digital Red 1TB 7200 RPM
RAM | CORSAIR Vengence Pro DDR3-2400 16GB
ODD | LG Blu-Ray Read/Write
OS | Windows 8.1 Home Premium x64
Monitor | Dell U2713HM 27" 1440p
Speakers | Bose Companion 2 Series III

The ODD is currently just cable-tied in place because the H110's too large and made it impossible to fit the 5.25" bay cradle properly. I'm going to try swapping out the rear 140mm fan for a 120mm fan, moving the H110 slightly further back and see if I can fix the issue with the ODD. Stay tuned for more updates!

***(29/01) Edit***: I've installed a Corsair AF120 Quiet Edition to replace the rear 140mm fan and moved the latter to the front and everything fits properly now! The H110 has been moved backwards and I can now install the 5.25" cage! Yay! See the new pictures here: http://imgur.com/a/yqStl  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi reddit, I'm building my first desktop and would appreciate some help. I have a budget of about SG$3000 (US$2400) and I've come up with the parts listed below. Please give me some advice on whether the choice of parts is good or I should purchase something else instead.

I'm also wondering if I have to buy CPU thermal paste separately and whether I should get an extra sound card like the Creative Audigy RX as I'm occasionally doing music recording.

Type|Item
:----|:----
Case | Fractal Design Define R4
PSU | Seasonic X Series 850W
Motherboard | ASUS Z97-PRO
CPU | Intel i7-4790K
GPU | 2x MSI GTX970 4GB Gaming GDDR5
CPU Cooler | CORSAIR H105 Hydro Series
SSD | Samsung 840 EVO 500GB (Don't need to buy this, already own one)
HDD | Seagate 1TB 7200R 64M SATA3
RAM | CORSAIR Vengence Pro 12800/1600Mhz CL9 KIT of 2 (16GB)
ODD | LG Blu-Ray reader
OS | Windows 7 Home Premium x64

Thanks!

Edit: Changed case to Fractal Design Define R4 due to rarity of the CM Silencio 652S and changed CPU Cooler to Corsair H105 instead of H110 as the H110 won't fit in the case (Max 240mm). </TEXT>

<TITLE> Have SG$100,000 university fund, what should I do? (SG) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-26 14:52:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi, I'm from Singapore. I'm 20 and will be attending a 3-year university course next year. I have been awarded SG$100,000 as a sort of 'scholarship fund' from my grandparents and was wondering how I should manage that. The course fees will total to $24,000 for the entire course which leaves me $76,000. 

I currently live with my parents and have no plans to move out anytime soon (Asian society). My university's quite far away (about 80+km round trip) and I was wondering if I should get a car as taking public transport will take up at least 3 hours each day. However, for those who aren't familiar with this tiny country that I live in, cars are ridiculously expensive and getting a half-decent car like a 5 year old VW Golf will cost around $70,000. In addition to that, getting a 5-year old car will mean only 5 more years of usage as 10-year usage rights come with each car, and this can only be renewed for another 10-years at a price of around $70,000. I'm thinking this isn't really wise as we have another spare car at home but using that would mean depriving my mum of using it. 

Another alternative is to save the money in a bank. But interest rates are ridiculously low now, meaning that with inflation, I'm losing money as long as I leave it in a bank. Should I invest the money? Fixed deposits or low-risk investments which have been returning quite a stable 10% over the years? I'm worried of investing as the market could crash anytime, just as how Gold prices fell sharply (I was planning on investing in that). 

Reddit, can you give me any good advice? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have an iPhone 6 Plus on iOS 8.1 and I thought upgrading from 8.0.2 would fix this problem but it didn't. My Today widgets don't seem to work properly.

The Reminders widget doesn't even show up even though there should be 2 reminders. The weather information in the Today Summary doesn't appear either. I've tried installing Wdgts and only half of the widgets show up even though I've selected all of them.

Is there a fix for this or is this a known bug? I've tried restarting the phone and what not, but the same problem is still persisting. </TEXT>

*Ads will still load on Wi-Fi.
