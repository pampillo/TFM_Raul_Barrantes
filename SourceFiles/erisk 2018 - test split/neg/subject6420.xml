<TEXT> I think it depends on where you get it. I got this from Taiwan and I had some actual dragonfruit as well there. It is not as sweet as you would expect and I think it probably gets its flavour masked very easily. It tasted a bit more like a soft, slightly sweet cucumber.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They also focus a lot more on helping the people realise their food dreams. I've never seen a Master Class before in the US version, while they do it every week or every so often in the last Season. The closest is usually Gordon Ramsay showing of how well he can fillet a fish or butcher a chicken. And also I've seen a lot of the AU contestants go to do great in the food industry. I mean Billy from season 7 ended up working for Heston Blumethal, Po went on as a TV Chef, Reynold opened his own restaurant, Matt has his food truck I think, even Rose has her cafe and from the reviews they are pretty good. Meanwhile in the US, from the list I've seen somewhere about the contestants, most of the top ones are doing things like websites, blogs, private chefs, private dinners, etc; that's not counting the cooking books they release which some people say are average. I think only one of them opened a restaurant and it didn't do that well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm more bothered by the fact that they tried to lie and pretend the wipe didn't happen and only come clean once they realised the lie didn't stick. Had they done pretty much anything else, it wouldn't have bothered me as much. For me, the only thing worse that they could have done would be to end the series right then. They could have addressed the reload the day they released the video or with the video itself; they could have accepted the wipe and gone with a B team; they would have worked the wipe and reload into the story i.e. "it was all a dream", or like when they played Road to Boruto with the "Man, it would suck if it went like that", or maybe some time travel alternate dimension shenanigans.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Physics teachers are always fun. Actually, scratch that, most science teachers are actually quite fun, mostly because they think of cool experiments that work theoretically but forget most of the other problems in practice. One physics teacher burnt her Polaroid glasses trying to see how they would polarize a laser. Another one burnt a couple of plastic folders from students trying to demonstrate how insulation works with electromagnetism and ionization. The one that takes the cake though was a chemistry teacher who once had us put bits of different solid chemicals around a metal plate over a Bunsen burner to see how they melted at different temperatures. Funny thing is theoretically it would work, with the Bunsen burner in the center of a circle and the chemicals around it, it would heat all of them evenly. However, he didn't account for a few facts that made the experiment a disaster in practice. First, heating a thin metal plate only in the center probably caused it to bend slightly due to the heat difference. Second, melting a solid that way only causes the bottom of it to melt which, on a smooth metal plate, causes it to lose friction and slide down the slope of the plate towards the center of the plate where it is hottest. Third, he probably forgot that some of the chemicals might have been flammable. This ended up with the whole plate catching fire and burning some of the other chemicals, one of which was sulfur or something like that. This released a lot of smoke and probably some noxious fumes from the way it kinda made a lot of people cough. Ended up evacuating the classroom to let it air out, and then going back in to grab our stuff and just go. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From my experience (two semi-failures): 
Have clean and dry equipment. Don't let water get into the meringue from your whisk/spatula. Have a piping bag with a wide circular tip. Use a template and don't forget they are going to spread a bit. Let your macarons dry after you pipe. Let them cool a bit before you peel them off the parchment paper. They are the best a day or so after you sandwich them as a little of the moisture gets into the cookie and it gets chewier. </TEXT>

<TEXT> On the other hand of the argument, I have seen videos from StJohns (New Zealand's more prominent EMS/Ambulance company) where some of the friends of the patient started assaulting the EMTs (admittedly they were reenactments, but for them to be concerned enough to release something like this means it's more common than they would like). Not a clue of what the guy was thinking but with alcohol and high emotions people tend to not think clearly. Add in the fact that guns are really common in Texas and I can see EMTs carrying guns for safety. Of course in the situations where you described above you are not in danger of other people assaulting you/shooting you, but what about in more urban cases like a traffic accident where someone wants you to treat their friend/family first regardless of the level of injury, or a party where someone doesn't feel like you are not doing everything you can for their friend because of alcohol/ignorance/not thinking clearly, etc.? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pros:

-As an Asian that is fluent with Spanish (not only that, Argentinian Spanish or Castellano) seeing Spanish-speaking people from countries like Chile, Peru, Spain, etc. hear me suddenly speak fluently with an unusual accent is hilarious, both for me and sometimes for them as well. 

-Specially with Latin-based languages, knowing one can be a huge help in learning others. Knew English and Spanish, with some French and Latin; breezed through German and Italian classes.

-When you get bored counting in one language, you can switch to another one to keep it different.

Cons: 

-Sometimes I forget to switch back to the correct language when I'm talking to more than one person.

-As I've lived in Argentina (which has a very heavy Italian influence), I actually use a lot of hand gestures when talking or use gestures like these https://youtu.be/Hxu50kiDVGc to communicate non-verbally. Most people have absolutely no idea what I'm doing with my hands.

-Not for me, but for my grandpa, he just uses random Spanish words around people whether those people speak Chinese or English. His English is very, very limited so this happens most of the time. He is probably used to it since most of my family speaks both Chinese and Spanish.

<TEXT> That is the simplest way of using money. Spend only what you have. A lot of people live that way and do relatively well. A lot of Chinese, especially older people, think like that, that you are spending more money on a loan than you would by paying upfront. But the thing about borrowing money you don't have is that you get to use (or enjoy) whatever you are purchasing now instead of having to wait. Like in your car example, you have been using your car for two months or more before you pay it in full. And if you are resourceful and assuming you could have paid for the car upfront, you could have used the money you didn't use on the car to make more money. 

Apart from that, using a credit card and paying it back gives you good credit rating, which in turn you can probably use for borrowing more on mortgages among other stuff. 

Also, to answer OP's question: I think most credit cards have a maximum amount you can "borrow". And credit card companies allow this because more than likely they will be able to collect it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mold is rooted to one spot because it has "roots" that it uses to absorb nutrients and stuff.
Bacteria are more complicated. Some of them can move because they have like a little motor that rotates and propels them, though a lot of them don't. A lot of other bacteria also produce secretions to hold them there. But most importantly, bacteria are like unimaginably tiny. Like hundreds of them can fit on a needle tip. Bacteria colonies like you see (the little coloured mounds) are probably formed by millions of bacteria. 
Also, there are tests for bacteria mobility. If they form mounds or spots on the agar plates, they probably can't move on their own. If you see a thin slightly opaque layer on the agar, that means that they've moved and spread on the plate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To add to this, this reaction allows more warm blood to flow towards the site of injury. And also, both the injury and the reaction bring the warm blood closer to your heat sensors and you feel warmer. It is kinda similar to when you drink alcohol you feel warmer but you are not really increasing your body temperature but bringing warm blood closer to your sensors. This is why it is a bad idea to drink alcohol to keep warm. You feel warm but you lose heat a lot faster. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because the nervous system doesn't work the same as electronics. It doesn't use electricity, but it uses ions on different sides of the neurons to transmit signals by releasing other chemicals or hormones. Also, it probably is a lot easier to generate a voltage surge in cables and circuits than in neurons. And a high enough EMP would probably generate also enough heat that the nervous system being affected is lower down the list of worries. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Basically the Prisoners Dilemma, sort of, if we add cheating and stealing to betraying others. If you cheat others and they don't cheat you, you end up profiting a lot while the other loses. If both of you cheat each other, you'll both end up losing more. If both of you are honest you'll not end up losing much, but you won't win much either.
Of course, reality is much more complicated. You get punished if you get caught cheating. Cheating is discouraged in most societies. Being honest is not encouraged if cheaters abound in your circles. Unlike in the Prisoners Dilemma if two people cheat each other, they might not be that bad off. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This one wasn't that bad but it was pretty funny seeing it. 
So I work at a Chinese Takeaway. This guy comes in and says to me: "Chicken, rice". So I'm confused because that describes like 10 different dishes we have. So I ask him if he can be more specific. He says again: "Chicken, rice". So I explain to him we have many dishes with chicken and rice. Does he want the chicken fried rice, or a chicken stir-fry with rice, or the roast chicken on rice? 
Apparently he gets frustrated with me and storms out, but not before delivering the great parting words "Nyeah Nyeah Nyeah Nyeah" while making talking hand gestures. Amazing. </TEXT>
