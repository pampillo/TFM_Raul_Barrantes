<TEXT> I just started IJ. I'm only on page 22 during the introduction of the marijuana addict, but I'm really liking it already. I don't find it all that hard to follow quite yet, just a lot of vocab and references that require some looking up, but the IJ wiki page is perfect for that. Really looking forward to this long ride! </TEXT>

<TEXT> It may depend on what you're into but these are all pretty easy to read and don't require as much extra thought. They all get you into the story pretty quickly and are relatively short.  

- And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie (mystery, page turner)
- The Giver by Lois Lowry (dystopian, young adult)
- The Long Walk by Stephen King (dystopian, thriller, page turner)
- The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton (coming of age, young adult)
- The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky (coming of age, young adult)

possibly these as well...they're short and you will be able to tell fairly quickly if it's for you or not. 

- Animal Farm by George Orwell (dystopian, symbolism, dark humor/satire)
- Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck (friendship)
- The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams (sci-fi, comedy)
- Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury (dystopian) </TEXT>

They're doing a reading of it right now on r/infinitediscussion and i've been wanting to read it for a long time.

<TEXT> Thank you! I really liked The Giver as well.

It is very tough for me to pick just one favorite book from here but I think the ones that have stuck with me the most are East of Eden, To Kill A Mockingbird, The Catcher in the Rye, and The Outsiders. I usually go for books with memorable characters and I think that's why I love these so much. 

As for which book surprised me the most, man these are tough questions, I'd say Catch-22 because of the hype on here and it's non-linear narrative gave me doubts, The Stranger because I didn't know anything about it and it peeled my eyelids back, and Watership Down because I did not expect a story about rabbits to be so engrossing and so real. I thought it would be simply a children's story and I was wrong. 

My future reading plans: I want to continue with classics but incorporate a lot newer literary fiction as well. I also have been wanting to tackle Infinite Jest for a long time because it just appeals to me, so maybe I will try to give that a go before jumping into shorter reads. Really I just look forward to being free to choose whatever I feel like, maybe even read a couple things at once! </TEXT>

<TITLE> [UPDATE] I have just completed a list of 40 popular books after not reading any books my entire adult life! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-09 20:34:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Almost nine months ago a friend and I decided we wanted to start reading more books. I had recently read a few books that got me into reading, but before then it had been about seven years since I last read a book in high school English class. Since then it was almost as if I never read any of these required books at all. I forgot most of the popular modern classics and had no knowledge of their influence on literature. My friend felt the same way. We questioned if we really read them or simply used SparkNotes to get by. To change this, we decided we had some catching up to do. We each picked 20 books from lists that were heavy on modern classics, put our lists together to form 40 books, shuffled the list, and got started on the journey intending to read them in the order they fell. Of course, this didn't go exactly as planned as we did alter it a bit later on. Two weeks into the journey, I ended up posting in this sub shortly after to share our story with Reddit.

[Original post and story](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/51phev/after_rediscovering_my_love_for_reading_i_will_be/)

The list ended up having a mix of modern classics, popular reads, and a few that were completely random. We kept the list relatively simple because we were still new to reading so we didn't want to get burned out by creating a monster list of old classics. 

The overall experience was unforgettable. I now love to read more than I ever did. Not only that, I now look forward to doing it whenever I have the chance. I love the learning experience and simply taking in the stories that other people have shared in their writing. I used to think of the act of reading a book as this tedious, daunting task that would require a significant amount of time and effort. Yes, it takes some time to finish a book. But it also takes time to partake in any activity. At least this activity is one worth spending time on. In the past, instead of wasting two hours watching a movie on television that I've already seen, I could have picked up Of Mice and Men and had an entire book finished. Instead of spending an hour blindly browsing Twitter on my phone, I could have put a dent in To Kill A Mockingbird. This experience forced me to put aside my phone for a few hours and get carried away in a story. 

I would be lying if I said every step of the way was a blast. Sure, there were some books I felt bored with or I just wanted the get to the end. In these moments I learned to put the book down and come back to it another time, even if it meant holding up my progress for a while. For the most part, I enjoyed the majority of the books we decided to read. Some more than others, of course, but I had an appreciation for each one. Honestly, there were no books that I could say I "hated". One struggle I came across about halfway through the list was thinking about how long our list was. I kind of regretted making the list 40 books instead of only 20 at times. It wasn't that I didn't like the book I was reading, it's just that at a certain point I wanted to branch off and do my own thing and not be tied down to a certain book. Sometimes I just felt like reading a particular book I found that wasn't on my list, but I couldn't read it cause I wanted to get through this darn list first. Because we both felt this way, we did end up changing the list a little bit. We removed a handful of the tougher, longer books we originally had on the list and put in some shorter ones. But in all we made it! Now I look forward to picking up and putting down any book I damn well please at any moment. 

I ended up tracking all of my progress on Goodreads and have become addicted to the site. I've written many short reviews for the books I've read, which has helped me reflect on each one. Everyone is so friendly and I constantly find great ideas for new books that interest me. I'm always looking for new friends to share experiences with on there. If you want to link up feel free to send me your profile in a private message and I will add you! 

I wanted to share my story and start a discussion about my experience with the books I've read, discuss reading in general, and maybe even inspire some new readers to form this positive habit. Reading regularly is something I believe I will continue to do throughout my entire life. 

If I get a lot of similar questions I will try to answer them up here.

**FAQ:** 

**Which was your favorite book?** 

Very tough to answer so I will give you a few. East of Eden, To Kill a Mockingbird, The Catcher in the Rye, The Outsiders, The Stranger, Animal Farm, Of Mice and Men, Watership Down, Catch-22, The Things They Carried, The Death of Ivan Ilych. I love memorable characters and I think a lot of these did that. 

**Which was the book you were most surprised about?**

Catch-22 because the hype gave me doubts and the non-linear narrative was tough at first, The Stranger because I knew nothing about it and it peeled my eyelids back, and Watership Down cause it had so much depth and was so real which I did not expect after seeing the cover. 

**What are my future reading plans/what will I read next?**

I plan on continuing with classics but incorporating more recent literary fiction and non-fiction. I also want to diversify my reading more in regards to authors and even genres. I may start reading Infinite Jest because I've wanted to tackle it for a long time. I know, there's another 9-month journey :D. If not, I will read either A Gentleman in Moscow or Rabbit Run because I got them as Christmas gifts and have not been able to read them yet! </TEXT>

Like a mad magician flinging silks and colored rags from his trunk the earth produced the yellow and white crocus, then the fox grape, the forsythia flowering on its stalks, the blades of iris, the apple tree blossoms of pink and white and green, the heavy lilac and the daffodil. Grandfather stood in the yard and gave a standing ovation. A breeze came up and blew from the maples a shower of spermatozoic soft-headed green buds. They caught in his sparse. He shook his head with delight, feeling a wreath had been bestowed. A joyful spasm took hold of him and he stuck his leg out in an old mans jig, lost his balance, and slid on the heel of his shoe into a sitting position. In this manner he cracked his pelvis and entered a period of health from which he would not recover. </TEXT>

<TEXT> - I'm reading **Ragtime** by E.L. Doctorow right now; It's wonderful. It's like injecting the feeling of the turn of the 20th Century in America. Reading the writing feels like how I imagine jumping in a pool of marshmallows feels like. 

- **Any Human Heart** by William Boyd is another good one with a very sprawling timeline. This time set in Europe. It follows one man's incredible life as he grows older. Taking place from post World War One to all his years beyond. Very touching. 

- Both the above are similar in the sense that they have a ton of huge historical figures that act as themselves but are surrounded by fictional characters. They both deal with a large scope as well. 

- My favorite is **East of Eden** by John Steinbeck. Might not be that dense with historical events, but it's as good a book as someone can ask for. 

- **The One Man** by Andrew Gross is another one worth checking out. It's a historical thriller they call it. It takes place during the Holocaust. It's quite the page-turner.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure at this time how to make books completely invisible, but that doesn't mean it can't be done. Maybe someone else could be of better help with this. I'd have to take a look at the site on my desktop when I get home.

I know you can at least prevent books from appearing on your feed when you rate them. I think either by going into your settings or another way is to go to your profile page and click x on the right side of your post to remove it from your feed quickly, although that could be risky. It will still show up in your shelves though either way.

Maybe you could play with the date read so it appears as one of the first books you've read? This way it gets buried at the bottom of your read shelf. I would test these out with books you don't mind sharing. 

Good luck with everything! Best wishes on trying to add a new little member to your family :)  </TEXT>

<TITLE> I'm looking for some "must read" 21st century literature </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-02 03:11:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm finishing up a reading list soon that mostly consists of classic/modern classic fiction. I'm looking to branch out afterwards and incorporate some high quality literature that was written closer to present day. Lets say *roughly* from 2000-2017. So what are some fiction books written in recent years that you feel are enjoyable, well written, and contain lessons that everyone should experience? Either those that will be considered classics sometime in the future or hidden gems. They don't have to take place in the 21st century necessarily, just as long as they were written in more recent years. 

If I put my book interests in a blender it would likely contain the following characteristics: Distinct characters and relationships, nostalgic,  historical, emotional, immersive, philosophical, flowery prose, and simple prose. 

Heres some of the classics that I really liked for your reference:

- East of Eden by John Steinbeck
- Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck
- To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee
- Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes
- The Stranger by Albert Camus
- The Catcher in the Rye J.D. Salinger

Thanks all!  </TEXT>

**The Outsiders, by S.E. Hinton** Read this over 10 years ago while in middle school I believe. Really looking forward to reading it as I don't remember much.


**Ragtime, by E.L. Doctorow** I'm a big fan of historical fiction so this has a strong appeal to me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Did you by any chance happen to read *Once a Jailbird* by Hans Fallada? I picked it up at a thrift store cause I knew the author, but haven't heard much about it. It looks interesting, but I think it's a less popular work of his.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just to make it clear to everyone since it confused me at first when I first discovered this book: *Alone in Berlin* by Hans Fallada is the same book as *Every Man Dies Alone*, which was also recommended here by u/Fuck_Passwords_

I believe Every Man Dies Alone is just the title they used for the American publication.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't get a chance to read it in high school, but read it recently at age 25 and loved it. The protagonist is obnoxious to many people, but remember this is only what it seems like on the surface. He really seems to be a caring kid that has a bunch of mental issues and nobody to turn to for help. There's so many wonderful subtleties throughout. The plot points, or lack thereof, aren't the point. It's certainly a polarizer, you either like it or you don't.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you want an emotional ride, and based on your description, i'd recommend *Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes*. It's got Sci-Fi, Philosophy, is emotionally engaging, easy to read, and has loads of wisdom. It's considered a 20th century classic-- published in 1966. Starts out with poor grammar on purpose, but it changes quickly, so don't be put off by that. 

I just got real into reading within the past year, so I was in the same boat. I had an urge to re-ead a ton of books that were forced down my throat in high school. And i've already found I love a bunch of them now that i'm older and out of college. I also learned that a lot of classics can look intimidating, especially the real old ones, but many of them are not that bad. For instance, The Count of Monte Cristo, 1300 page book from the 1800's. Sounds rough, but so fast paced and engaging once you just dive into it. But then there are the heavy duty classics, which may be a different story.

If your looking to really get into reading as a hobby, i'd also suggest creating a Goodreads account and keeping track of the books you've read. You can add people, create your own shelves, rate and review books, and get reccomendations. It's a great way to stay motivated and search for new books. Also if you haven't already, check out all the awesome subreddits on here starting with r/books in addition to this one.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm only 50 pages into Catch-22 by Joseph Heller and I feel like i'm reading a new favorite of mine. I usually don't laugh out loud at books but it's doing that to me. The amazing part is i'm not sure I really know whats going on with the storyline yet but I feel like it's headed somewhere incredible. At least I hope so. Every scene appears to be so random but hilarious. 

So, what are some books that you picked up and thought to yourself early on...My God I love this book already...


**(POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS IN LINES BELOW)**

**UPDATE 1:**

The Nately's Old Man chapter - Woah, holding on to my seatbelt here it comes...

**UPDATE 2** 

All finished! It got so deep later on. I loved the switching back and forth between humor and tragedy. Will likely reread in the future. </TEXT>

Also, Vonnegut has a bunch of his best sellers in that same type of print as the red color version.

<TEXT> I have the same problem sometimes. And it's easy to suggest trying another type of book but I know It's not always that simple. Even books I really like I can still struggle with at certain times. Some things that help me.

-  As another person suggested, always do your best to get a good night sleep. 

-  Eat a wholesome meal. Don't eat too much though or you might need a nap. I find it much easier to focus when I have fuel in me. 

- Get some exercise. Doesn't need to be anything crazy. But just going for a walk for awhile will relax your mind in so many ways. If your constantly sitting there thinking about how you want to read more it will consume you.

- Hot shower. A clean body is a clean mind. Sounds weird but when I feel refreshed i'm at my best mentally. It will also wake you up temporarily. 

- Good lighting helps me visually and also keeps me awake.

- Find a nice chair to sit up in. This will better your chances of remaining awake and alert while reading. Laying down will make your mind think its time for that nap.

- Put your cell phone in another room! I read so much more when i'm not constantly pressed with the urge to check my phone. Just leave the ringer on in case someone calls because of an emergency.

- Read out loud to yourself. Sounds funny I know, but this really does help me when I can't seem to focus. Doing it for awhile allows me to comprehend what i'm reading. Then, go back to reading normally, you will feel like your reading lightning quick and taking it all in. 

- Do a little research on the background and topic of the book beforehand to get you into the mood of what its all about. Just be careful about spoilers. 

- Try some easy listening music in the background. I listen to classical sometimes to keep noises from distracting me. 

- May or may not be a good suggestion, but Coffee helps me focus. I drink tooo much coffee. So it's an addictive habit. Be careful. 

Hope any of these help. Good luck!

<TEXT> I don't want to be cliche by saying 11/22/63 was life changing for me, but thats exactly what it was. Here's why in case anyone cares. 

About 8-9 months ago I was sitting around one weekend and downloaded 1984 by George Orwell. It was the first book I've read since probably 7 years ago while I was in high school and I really liked it. But then the next book I picked up from the library was 11/22/63 because I was interested in the JFK topic. This book made me obsessed with reading ever since. I started a reading challenge of popular books afterwards with a friend. And I have read nearly 50 books since then after not reading a single book in all my adult life.

So no matter what I read from here on out. No matter how many books I read that have more critical acclaim. And no matter what else I read by Stephen King, this one will always be one of my favorite books ever.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's actually very readable. It's a story about one man, there are not many character names to remember, and the settings are painted very clearly. It's not like your reading a tough philosophy book where it's a slog to get through and hard to follow along. The only aspect which I could see it being difficult is understanding the deeper meanings to what's happening in the story and in his mind. But I think these can be discovered later on after the story is over with some help from the internet. I'll be honest, I'm still rather new at this reading thing. I only seriously got into it within the past year, and although I have been through college (non-literature related degree) I don't consider myself all that intelligent. With that in mind, I found The Stranger to be an easy read and very deep at the same time. The good part about it is it's a very short read! So if you find yourself not loving it you won't have very far to go until your finished. I read the Matthew Ward translation. Some may say other older translations are better, but this is the only one I have experience with and I found it simple to follow. Hope this helps!

Edit: Just noticed above. If you could understand A Clockwork Orange and love it then you won't have any issue with The Stranger :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I usually follow Goodreads guidelines pretty closely. But I tend to lean toward how much I enjoyed a book rather than how many stars I think it deserves. These often go hand in hand, however.

**1 - Star:** I disliked it and/or it was a chore to finish.

**2 - Star:** It was okay. I didn't dislike the book but it also didn't really enjoy the experience that much overall. I will mostly forget about the experience over time. 

**3 - Star:** I liked it. Reading it was enjoyable overall. Didn't love it but was glad I read it. I think there's this misconception that when someone rates a book 3 stars it means the book is below average because most books hold an average rating above 3. But I try not to think this way with my personal ratings. 3 should be middle ground. The rating system is simply not flexible enough to begin with. Why limit yourself by only rating things 4 and 5 stars if you don't reaaaallly like them. When you have many books rated 4 stars, but can identify some you definetely like more than others, then the latter should probably be a lower rating. 

**4 - Star:** I really really liked them and/or they were just a damned good read. Either way, I really enjoyed the reading experience. I'm just not ready to call them one of my favorite books. Because i'm not, there are some fantastic books i've read, and really enjoyed but did not give them 5 stars because they didn't have a long lasting effect on me.

**5 - Star:** This is reserved for books that are instant favorites of mine. I will come back to them someday and read it. There are moments when I was reading it and had to stop and put down the book and stare at the ceiling because I connected so much with it. If it didn't include these moments, they damn well sucked me into its world and left me with an enormous book hangover. </TEXT>

A Farewell to Arms by Ernest Hemingway is another great one. It's not as gritty as the one above, but it's very dark nonetheless.

<TEXT> There's a bunch of relevant ones in **Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes.**


 "There are so many doors to open. I am impatient to begin."


 "...Don't feel sorry for me. I'm glad I had a second chance in life like you said to be smart because I learned a lot of things that I never knew were in this world, and I'm grateful I saw it even for a little bit."


 "Now I understand that one of the important reasons for going to college and getting an education is to learn that the things you've believed in all your life aren't true, and that nothing is what it appears to be."


"The path I choose through the maze makes me what I am. I am not only a thing, but also a way of being--one of many ways--and knowing the paths I have followed and the ones left to take will help me understand what I am becoming."

<TEXT> I have a list on Goodreads of books I come across that look interesting to me so I save them in a to-read shelf online. I will likely never get to all of these because it's in the hundreds now and growing, but it's a good source to pull ideas from. However, I also have a bunch of unread books on my personal, physical shelf that usually get priority since I own them. This is the list I was primarily referring to in the title and I plan on reading all of them. So I kind of just meant that my physical bookshelf is piling up and I should probably hold off on buying new books for awhile, but I simply can't resist when it comes to good deals. I think i'm over 100 books on my physical shelf now after today. If you're interested I do have both of these "lists" in two different online shelves on [my Goodreads page](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2829998-ian)

I'm always looking to share book ideas with people so feel free to add me if you have an account. The ones in this haul I picked up because I know the authors or titles. Many of them are highly regarded names in classic literature (Dostoyevsky, Faulkner, Capote, Marquez, Orwell) and some more modern (Smith, Dellilo, Foer). Then a few of the others are bestsellers I believe. I'm into a lot of literary fiction so you will find a lot more of that on my Goodreads lists. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This was exactly my thought process. I saw the same video with the Karate Kid clips. Now it's driving me crazy as well! Seems like it would be a memorable qoute but it doesn't show up in any of the IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes qoutes for that movie, or other searches. It's very possible the fanmade video just used Karate Kid and the lyrics aren't even from that movie. My guess is that it's from an 80's movie of some sort. We may have to watch the movie to find out, its been years for me.

Edit: there are actually at least 2 videos using Karate Kid clips in the music video, so it's definitely the best lead we have.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It could be just me but the minimalist type of writing style in The Road reminded me of Farewell to Arms by Hemingway. Both use spare diologue as well as use "and" multiple times per sentence. The Road is consistently bleak while Farewell to Arms offers some colorful moments, although both are very dark overall. Apart from the writing styles and emotional storylines the two novels are very different. 

Unfortunately, I haven't read anything else from these writers yet, so I can't comment on their other books. You may find more of that style in McCarthy's other works, however.  </TEXT>

You could try another genre that you normally wouldn't go for, like non-fiction. Try reading in another setting than your used to, such as at the park or somewhere else outdoors. Maybe try audiobooks instead. Or take a break from reading books entirely for a little till your in a different emotional state. No need to force yourself to finish the series as soon as possible.

<TEXT> East of Eden does get crazy hype on here, but for me it lived up to that. But try not to be expecting something mindboggling every time you turn the page, let it come to you and enjoy the ride. I haven't read Infinite Jest, but it won't be like some groundbreaking style that blows your mind. If you have read Steinbeck before you can expect his same cozy style of writing. It's a wonderful story about two families finding their paths and teetering between good and evil. It is easy to read and understand, but so deep in every other aspect. It has not just one of the most memorable characters i've read, but about three of them at the very least. The scenery and people on the page are painted so vividly as well. Every page was just so pleasurable to read. 

That would be my vote. Just go into it like your there to read a nice long story and you will absolutely love it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have only been a reader for about 7 months now and have been catching up on mostly modern classics. So in no order, here are the best i've read in this time:

- **11/22/63** - single handedly rekindled my love for reading. It took me to another place, another time, and made me feel like I was living in the 60's and hanging out with the characters. It started my newly found addiction.

- **East of Eden** - For the first time I couldn't fathom how one person sitting down to write could come up with a story so beautiful and tragic. I think I called all members of my family right after. 

- **Watership Down** - The first time I felt like I was on an adventure. The rabbits came to life, and there are these 2 chapters near the end that blew my mind. 

- **The Count of Monte Cristo** - although I got a taste of this with 11.22.63, this most certainly conquered my fear of long books. I now love the journey of longer books because so much time is spent in its world that you feel awful and satifisfied at the same time after you finish. Dantes is the most badass character I know. 

- **To Kill a Mockingbird** - A book that made me feel nostalgic in the best way possible, not for the time period, but for my own childhood. Playing silly games outside with friends and suspecting certain adults are these scary monsters. Also just helped reinforce in my mind that everyone is born a human being, how we look at each other is taught and not some genetic disposition. 

- **The Catcher in the Rye** - First time I went from laughing out loud at a character, to loving a character, to hating a character, and then feeling sorry for a character back and forth in a just a matter of pages. It will stick with me forever.

- **Animal Farm** - My first experience loving animal characters in a book, before I read Watership. First time I laughed out loud and nearly cried during a book as well. And it's not even about animals after all. 

- **Of Mice and Men** - A book that made me love the beauty of the written word. It made me feel like I was in the fields or in the barns with the characters. It just gave me this cozy feeling reading it that I can't explain. And then it shit all over that cozy feeling. 

- **Flowers for Algernon** - The first book that just crushed me and made me think about what I can do to better myself. How I can treat people around me better.

- **And Then There Were None** - One of the first books I didn't want to put down and couldn't wait to get back to. I felt a comrodery with the people stranded at that mansion and wanted them to find out the mystery so bad.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Such a flawless book. I finished it in one sitting as well. Don't even get me started on Boxer....tears.


If you liked the animal aspect of it, look into *Watership Down* by Richard Adams. It's not as symbolic as Animal Farm, but more of an adventure. It has a very real feel to it, beautifully written, and is basically about Badass rabbits fighting and planning for survival from their perspective. It's longer and has more of a buildup, but again you won't get as much of the humor and allegorical stuff you get with Animal Farm. Although you do get to see some humans through the eyes of the rabbits which is fun.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would go with your gut of what interests you the most.

- **Fahrenheit 451** - This would be my choice for you IF you're not a heavy reader. It's short, easy to understand, shows you the importance of reading and having your own freedom of thought, and extremely relevant to school and education. I'm sure there is a ton of credible academic research out there on this novel for you as well to gather from. 

- **The Road** - Post Apocalyptic, also short, easy to read but deceptive (lots of hidden meaning behind few words), engaging, but VERY bleak. It is a very dark book, both in its setting and emotions. There are endless amounts of things you could talk about in your report about the minimal style. Mccarthy uses very few words of dialogue to convey his powerful messages. 

- **One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest** - This one is my favorite book out of all of them. But if I'm being completely honest with you, I doubt I would have liked it when I was in grade school. It's a bit longer of a read than the other two, but not bad. Kesey creates such a vivid picture of a mental hospital using such astonishing visual descriptions. I think it takes a little bit more getting into initially than the other two, but it was the most rewarding payoff for me in the end. The setting is almost all in one place and not that much happens plot-wise, which is why I think you may like the other two more if you're plot driven. 

All three of these are great books, and I recommend trying to read them sometime down the road (no pun intended). Good luck with your report and have fun reading! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm reading Mrs. Dalloway right now and although it was difficult to follow at first I got a hold on the style fairly quickly. There's not really a very exciting plot in this either but multiple perspectives and the characters internal thoughts is really interesting to me now. What helped me with Dalloway is to look up a list of characters names as I go along. Now that things flow easier I realize it's nothing like I've ever read before.  

To the Lighthouse sounds sort of similar from your description, although I haven't read it.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't read IT so i'm not sure how this recommendation compares and its not a scary novel. I'm pretty sure the only thing in common might be the "heavy childhood" part. But..

*To Kill A Mockingbird* is one of my favorites due in part by the naive, innocent perspective it is told from. I supposedly read it in high school but didnt remember any of it until I tried again a few months ago. It has that vibe of childhood nastalgia when they're playing different games outside in the summers and witnessing adults do things they don't understand.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Love it. I will add The Orchard Keeper now as well. I tend to really like writing that uses gorgeous prose to capture a vivid image of the setting, so I'm really looking forward to it. I will just have to see for myself if his style is for me or not. I feel like I only caught smaller doses of this in The Road compared to what I might see in his other works.  

Any suggestion for a good starting point with McCarthy after reading The Road? Are they all just as dark or are there any that have a bit more brightness in its atmosphere? I might enjoy something even more if it is not so bleak.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> So dark and bleak, yet beautiful at the same time. The minimalistic writing reminds me of Hemingway's *Farewell to Arms*, but consistently dark throughout where the latter had fluctuation both in colors and emotions. Both have that sentence structure where they use the word **"and"** about 5 times in one sentence.

This is my first experience with McCarthy. I'm wondering if this same spare and minimal type of writing is what he uses in most of his books, or is it an experimental thing solely for this novel?

I plan on reading his other works eventually and just I'm curious what I can expect. I've heard some of his books can be difficult to understand, but I had no trouble understanding The Road. This might be one of the more readable ones, though? Others I plan on getting to:

- Suttree
- Blood Meridian
- No Country for Old Men
- Child of God
- The Orchard Keeper </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, I loved that chapter so much. I think I was hooked as soon as I read this:

*When a child first catches adults out -- when it first walks into his grave little head that adults do not always have divine intelligence, that their judgments are not always wise, their thinking true, their sentences just -- his world falls into panic desolation. The gods are fallen and all safety gone. And there is one sure thing about the fall of gods: they do not fall a little; they crash and shatter or sink deeply into green muck. It is a tedious job to build them up again; they never quite shine. And the child's world is never quite whole again. It is an aching kind of growing.* </TEXT>

<TITLE> A somewhat odd request for a book with particular similarities to The Breakfast Club </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-22 00:27:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm looking for books where there are a group of people, teenagers or adults, that are gathered in a particular setting and become very close by the end of the story.


- I'm looking for a book that will include at least a handful of major characters in a similar situation or setting that may be very different but end up forming a bond. 

- They don't all have to be in one place the entire time like in the Breakfast Club, but they should at least spend a lot of time together throughout the story in a particular situation and form a bond.

- Some other shows/movies that have a similar vibe are *Freaks and Geeks* as well as *Undeclared*. I'm not looking only for comedy books though, but more so the aspect of them sharing a similar situation. I do also like the coming of age part of these such as in a high school or college setting where all the characters attend. This is not essential, however. As long as I can connect with all the characters I'll be happy. 

- **Before anyone suggests it...** I already have read *Perks of Being a Wallflower*, which I did really like. I'm also not that big into Sci-fi or Fantasy unless it is centered around human characters.

- I prefer books that are well written, provide character development, and offer interesting insights on life. Don't stress if you can't pinpoint these traits, I'd rather hear what people come up with and decide on my own if they suit what I'm looking for. 

- That being said, I do also like quality literature as well as lighter books that I can kick back and breeze through. Don't be afraid to suggest any heavy hitters. 

- This might be a weird example and the only similarity i'm thinking about is the particular setting bit. But in *And Then There Were None* I enjoyed how I got to know a group of characters really well cause they were stuck in a mansion together. **I don't** really want mystery suggestions, though. 

I know this might sound like an odd request, but I'm sitting here watching *The Breakfast Club* for the first time in a while and thinking....damn I really love how they knew nothing about each other and by the end, they all formed such a comradery.  

Thanks for the suggestions! </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Me reading East of Eden:*

**Chapter 1** - Description of the land in Salinas. Okay, I love the prose though even if it's just descriptions of mountains and valleys. 

**Chapter 2** - Meeting the Hamiltons. Alright, here's a family. Nothing really has happened, though. 

**Chapter 3** - Oh here's another family, enough with the introductions alread-- *MOTHER OF GOD.* This is my new favorite book. 

Definitely give it another shot if you loved the wisdom and insight on life that was in Cannery Row. There's a lot more of that to be seen in EoE. You were still at that point where nothing really has happened yet.

EDIT: If you liked Cannery Row mostly because of the comedy, judging by your username, there's not as much of that to be had in EoE.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cannery Row is not really centered around a central plot like many novels so that aspect won't really draw you in. Except there is one thing you could consider a plot that will be introduced. It drew me in from the writing and then eventually the characters. It gets incredibly funny and Steinbeck also drops some bombs of wisdom on you out of nowhere. Keep up with it, you're probably still meeting the town and characters if I'm remembering correctly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **The Road, by Cormac McCarthy**

 - My first McCarthy experience. Very particular in style. Minimalistic in dialogue and descriptions but effective.  Reminds me of the style Hemingway used in Farewell to Arms, except in that there was a fluctuation of dark and bright colors, both in mood and setting, whereas in The Road it has been basically darkness throughout so far. 

*After that:*

**Mrs. Dalloway, by Virginia Woolf**

 - This will also be my first experience with Woolf.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's epic. Here are some quick tips.

**1.** Get the Robin Buss translation from Penguin Classics. Unabridged.  

**2.** Read a little bit about France in the 1800's - Bonapartists vs. Royalists. You don't need to be an expert by any means, but a general understanding will make the book that much more interesting. 

**3.** Get familiar with titles of peoples names in the french language and their abbreviations. This will help differentiate the characters when you first start to meet them. Don't worry, you get to know them well while you read. 

- M. -- Monseur = Mister
- Mme. -- Madame = Missus
- Mlle. -- Mademoiselle = Miss

**4.** The scenes in Cristo are notoriously long. So if you ever feel like "what does this have to do with the story, please get back to the main plot"...theres a reason for it. These scenes make the end that much better. 

Besides this, enjoy the ride! There's no denying there are a lot of pages, but once you get into the story the book will fly by and you will wonder where all those pages went.

<TEXT> Well said. That's definitely the best approach. Sometimes certain books and authors connect with you better at different stages in your life, so if something bores you now you can always put it down and try again in a few years. Most of the books I read in high school I had to struggle through back then and now I love them after giving them another shot.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're welcome. Also, i'm not sure if this is what your looking for but in regards to *East of Eden*. If you want an intro into Steinbeck's style you could always give *Of Mice and Men* or *Cannery Row* a shot as well. Both are short and have a ton of great outlooks on life.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Flowers for Algernon* is basically emotional empathy building 101. It is also a powerful work of self acceptance that holds your attention throughout. Starts out written differently than your typical book, but only initially. It's an emotional ride, just to forwarn you.  

*To Kill A Mockingbird* also taught me a lot about life and the positive and negative qualities that exist in every person. Understanding other peoples perspectives is important. 

Both are easy to read and enjoyable in my opinion. 

I also suggest giving *East of Eden* another shot one day when you're in the mood. I don't know how far you got, but it definitely picks up and has so much great stuff in it:

"And now that you don't have to be perfect, you can be good." - John Steinbeck, East of Eden

<TEXT> More accurately it was $32 and change. Most of them $3 and a few for $2. I was as suprised as you are when I saw so many books for so cheap. The place sells overstock books so the majority of the books looked terrible to be honest. I had to do A LOT of digging, but i'm glad I did. I feel like these might be cheaper prints, but they look just fine to me as none are abridged. Titles like The Orphan Master's Son, The English Patient, A Visit from the Goon Squad, and many others I recognized by the titles. Others by Russo, McCann, Haruf, and Fallada I recognized by their names and figured they looked decent enough to be enjoyable. They are all in pretty good shape too, the bindings are tight and pages look new on the inside despite some sun damage on the outside of a few. They no longer have that coveted new book smell, but i'm just happy to get a hold of them at all. I will definitely check out Empire Falls now. Thanks for sharing all your experience with these!   </TEXT>

<TITLE> Watership Down - Richard Adams </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-12 23:28:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It was evening of the following day. The north-facing escarpment of Watership Down, in shadow since early morning, now caught the western sun for an hour before twilight. Three hundred feet the down rose vertically in a stretch of no more than six hundred  a precipitous wall, from the thin belt of trees at the foot to the ridge where the steep flattened out. The light, full and smooth, lay like a gold rind over the turf, the furze and yew bushes, the few wind-stunted thorn trees. From the ridge, the light seemed to cover all the slope below, drowsy and still. But down in the grass itself, between the bushes, in that thick forest trodden by the beetle, the spider and the hunting shrew, the moving light was like a wind that danced among them to set them scurrying and weaving. The red rays flickered in and out of the grass stems, flashing minutely on membranous wings, casting long shadows behind the thinnest of filamentary legs, breaking each patch of bare soil into a myriad individual grains. The insects buzzed, whined, hummed, stridulated and droned as the air grew warmer in the sunset. Louder yet calmer than they, among the trees, sounded the yellow-hammer, the linnet and greenfinch. The larks went up, twittering in the scented air above the down. From the summit, the apparent immobility of the vast, blue distance was broken, here and there, by wisps of smoke and tiny, momentary flashes of glass. Far below lay the fields green with wheat, the flat pastures grazed by horses, the darker greens of the woods. They too, like the hillside jungle, were tumultuous with evening, but from the remote height turned to stillness, their fierceness tempered by the air that lay between. </TEXT>

Some may disagree with some of these being classified as page turners, but I was so immersed in all of these and felt I needed to see what happened next. Its safe to put And Then There Were None in the page turner category though, no doubt.

<TEXT> Don't be mad at me, but I actually have this already on my audible account from a trial I had recently. I haven't listened to it yet nor watched the movie but have heard it's thrilling. Now you convinced me that I really need to jump into it. 

If you're wondering why I'm looking for more when I haven't even finished all the ones I own: I no longer have a paid audible account because I wanted to save money. Over on eStories I have a couple credits on my account that i'm trying to use so I can cancel that as well. But I figured I might as well not limit myself to suggestions that are only available on eStories because eventually if I get into a better listening habit I will most likely invest in audible again.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a couple credits saved up that I need to use and can't for the life of me decide on what to spend them on. I normally prefer to sit down and read physical books and tend to get easily distracted when I listen to audio, so something that is rather easy to follow and engrossing would be great. Whenever I see a book that I want to read in audiobook I don't pull the trigger because I'm worried it would be better read in its physical form. So do you have any that you would say enhances the regular book's reading experience? 

Here are some of my favorite books so you get a better idea of what i'm in to:

- East of Eden by John Steinbeck
- 11.22.63 by Stephen King
- To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee
- The Count of Monte Criso by Alexandre Dumas
- Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes
- And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie
- Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck
- Animal Farm by George Orwell
- The Giver by Lois Lowry
- The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky

EDIT: I haven't been a heavy reader for very long, only getting back into reading within the past year. I've been doing a reading challenge that includes catching up on a lot of classics. Because of this my favorite books list seems to be heavily favored towards classics, but I enjoy anything, just haven't read as much modern literature yet! 

Thanks in advance for your help!

<TEXT> Hey, I can tell you're a good writer. You should try to keep writing your thoughts down as a way to express some of your emotions if you haven't already. Even if you keep it private, it's still a good way to prevent things from being bottled up. You could also try talking to a therapist, they can be very helpful, but that is entirely up to you. 

I don't know how old you are, but when I was in high school I use to be deathly shy around people and couldn't for the life of me start up a conversation. I used to think too much about it, I was scared other people would think I was weird if I said the wrong things, and by not speaking at all I thought I could prevent this, but I most likely gave people the exact impression I was trying to avoid. I was lonely. I couldn't stand living like that anymore so when I finally went to college, instead of commuting to and from school as I initially intended, I decided to force myself to live in the dorms on campus. This way I would be surrounded by people that I would have to interact with one way or another. It wasn't easy and I was petrified at first, but It ended up being the best decision I ever made in my life. I met some of my best friends that I still hang out with years later. If those same people went to my high school, I would have never started talking to them. The lack of cliques in college was a dream come true for me. We were not very relatable, the only thing in common was we were college kids trying to figure our lives out, but somehow, over time, we clicked. Everyone is alike in a sense that we are just people, carrying flaws that we hide below the surface, but above the surface we display only the highlights of our lives on platforms like social media. Everyone you see on Facebook is most likely hiding the things that make them unique from everyone else because of how they think they will be perceived. I'm no longer afraid of what people think of me because as long as you're not being a complete asshole or creepy as fuck, nobody will care for more than a couple seconds If you say something silly or stutter. Nobody thinks as much about a person's flaws as much as that person does themselves. 

So my advice to you, try to get out and get involved in something that interests you. Anything at all. Doesn't matter what your age is or what the activity is, just get out there. You like books? Find a book club online and join. Like to collect antiques? Go to a convention and ask someone about their treasures. I know it will be extremely difficult at first to take that initial step, but once you do you will not only feel good that you did, you may just meet people you can relate to and form a relationship. Hey, you may not like what you participated in at first either, these things take time, but by making an attempt at it you will feel accomplished and may work up the confidence to try it again. You are certainly not alone on this.

As for books, I haven't read all that many yet that address the topic. One of them you may relate to, which someone posted earlier, is Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky. I think it captures the protagonist's anger of not being able to relate to most people, but he finds comfort and hope in a pair of upperclassmen. He also has a love for books and finds an unlikely friend in his English teacher. The audiobook by Noah Galvin was also good and I thought it brought out a lot if the emotions of the book. 

Head up, OP... things will get better if you choose to make them better! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Books similar to East of Eden by John Steinbeck? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-03 22:56:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I loved so many things about this book. I'm not looking for necessarily just the good vs evil type of story, nor the biblical aspect, but rather other things that captured me I would love to see in some other books.

Things I loved about it:

1. **Character Development and Connection** - The way the characters and their families were built up. I liked how it dedicates entire chapters to a story about a specific character, then brings them together so you feel like you know every one of them very well. The book also demonstrates each persons flaws and has them sometimes learn from their mistakes throughout the book. When the book is over you feel like you're saying goodbye to people you actually know. 

2. **The writing and prose** - I love Steinbecks writing. The way the sentences capture the surroundings and just make you feel like you're with the characters wherever they go. It is just a pleasure to read-- effortless and elegant flow.  Chapter 3 of East of Eden might be one of the single best chapters i've ever read, and when I read it thats when I was hooked. So far I have also read Cannery Row and Of Mice and Men and plan on reading basically all his other ones, so i'm moreso looking for recommendations on other authors that may be comparable. 

3. **The words of wisdom** - Basically the way it commentates on problems we can relate to and offers a new look on things. For example:

 "In human affairs of danger and delicacy successful conclusion is sharply limited by hurry. So often men trip by being in a rush. If one were properly to perform a difficult and subtle act, he should first inspect the end to be achieved and then, once he had accepted the end as desirable, he should forget it completely and concentrate solely on the means. By this method he would not be moved to false action by anxiety or hurry or fear. Very few people learn this."



Suggestions don't need to be as sprawling as EOE either. It was cool how the first half is focused on the father's life and then the second the life of his sons. However, it's not essential in what i'm looking for. 

Looking forward to ideas! Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I read Five Presidents by Clint Hill recently which was fascinating to me. It covers Clint's time in the Secret Service from I believe 1958-1975. He's most known as the guy who jumped on to the back of JFK's limousine in an attempt to shield the president and first lady moments after the president was assassinated. While it doesn't go into a ton of detail about a single specific event, it does offer an interesting perspective from inside the White House and some details on a variety of the major events during that time. One interesting part for me was reading about the more human side of the presidents that he got to know from working so closely with. 

It's very straightforward and simple in it's writing, so you won't find anything extravagant there. However, his story still sucks you in and gives you a general knowledge of the major events during that time as well as an appreciation for the U.S. Secret Service. I also loved the photos that the book included.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Awesome haul. I have pretty much every one of these on my to-read list still, the only one i've read being East of Eden. Since you said you haven't read in awhile it may be wise to start with something that won't require much commitment in order to get you back into it. Night is a short one, but might be painful to read though judging it solely on its topic. I'd say Vonnegut might be a good start, although he has a very particular style his reads are rather short. Only ones i've read by him so far are Sirens of Titan and Cat's Cradle, both being simple to read while still dense with ideas.

Don't be afraid to jump into East of Eden when you're feeling up for it. I find Steinbeck to be very simple to read and he also produces beautiful imagery. It's an amazing character study of good vs. evil. If you like books where you are strongly connected with the characters despite their flaws and these characters grow throughout, then you will like that one. It's one of my personal favorites.  </TEXT>

It had me locked in the entire time. Look up a description of it and if the subject matter appeals to you its definitely worth a go.  

I still need to give more of his books a try, but I can confirm from this one that his storytelling is very engrossing.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> (Update) After rediscovering my love of reading I will attempt to conquer a list of 40 (mostly) classic books </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-06 14:09:02 </DATE>

<TEXT> [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/51phev/after_rediscovering_my_love_for_reading_i_will_be/)

(Scroll to the bottom of list for updated post)

From original post:

"It has been over 6 years since I graduated high school, and I'm still in school studying boring old textbooks to earn my second college degree. During that span of time, I thought that someone would have to pay me to get me to read outside of my schoolwork. I suppose I was too tired of staring at all these words for class, not to mention staring at a computer screen all day at work, and it was easier to lay down afterward and turn on the latest hit Netflix series. 

That was until recently.. For a couple of months during the summer I had no classes, freeing up a lot of time during my weekends. I was playing with my phone one morning and found a free trial of Amazon Unlimited-- so I decided to download the ebook of *1984* by George Orwell (Can't remember what made me pick that one but I knew it was considered a classic). The book completely sucked me in. I don't want to put out any spoilers, so lets just say that some of the story scared the shit out of me. After that, my college buddy mentioned he watched a cool tv series called *11.22.63*. I looked it up and found out it was also a Stephen King novel about JFK, time-travel, and altering history..woah..sounds like I could get into this. "Oh shit, the book is over 800 pages, I will never be able to get through this." Well, I checked this one out from a nearby library and decided to give it a shot. I couldn't believe how quickly I got engrossed in the story and didn't want to put it down. The storytelling by King made me feel like I was actually in the main characters shoes. Loving every minute of it, I finished that behemoth in only 2 weeks. I knew I needed to find another read fast to fill the void inside me that *11.22.63* left behind. Then, my best friend from my hometown suggested I read *Ready Player One* by Ernest Cline as it's one of his favorites (We're gamers at heart). This one..well this one was just flat out fun. I finished this one in another week's time. 

After telling my friend about how much I've enjoyed reading lately, he told me he was also looking to read more. We both wished we read more of those so-called classics back in high school and so on. So I suggested we do a reading challenge of some sort. Well, we decided to come up with our own list. He would pick 20 from a few online lists of highly regarded books and I would pick another 20. We both picked some of the same books, leading to us just filling out the list with a couple of our own choices. We picked our books from the following lists:

[Reddit's Favorite Books](https://www.reddit.com/r/raerth/comments/cpxkq/reddits_favourite_books/)

[Guardian's 1000 Books](http://www.listchallenges.com/guardians-1000-novels-everyone-must-read)

[and also here](http://www.loved.la/books/genre/Collections/1001_Books)

Once we had our 40, we shuffled the list and agreed to read them in the order they fall. So here is the final list. *drumroll*


**Book List**


* Cats Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut

* The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway

* Brave New World by Aldous Huxley

* All Quiet on the Western Front by Erich Maria Remarque

* American Psycho Bret Easton Ellis

* Slaughterhouse-five by Kurt Vonnegut

* Post Office by Charles Bukowski "

**New Post - Update:**

It has been about 3 months since I started the reading list and I have been enjoying every book for the most part.. some more than others. I have currently made it through the first 13 books up until Cosmos by Carl Sagan. In addition, I have read 5 more awesome books not on the list! This was because my friend was a bit behind me and I wanted to let him catch up so we could enjoy each one together. 

The 5 not on the list are:

* The Journey to the East by Herman Hesse (actually read this for school, but was pleasantly suprised) 

* Cannery Row by John Steinbeck 

* Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov

* Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes

* The Most Dangerous Game by Richard Connell. 

My favorites so far from the list of 40, in no particular order: All Quiet on the Western Front, Perks of Being a Wallflower, Man's Search for Meaning, And Then There Were None, Sirens of Titan, and Any Human Heart

Currently, we skipped ahead and are reading East of Eden because many people have been trying to get me to read it and I gave into my own desire to do so. We will then be jumping back to Cosmos after!

I wanted to post this update to have an open discussion about the ones I've read, as well as the ones that are still to come. I did get a lot of people in the original post suggesting I write reviews on Goodreads as I go through them. While I did some written reviews early on I have been slacking recently, but I intend to be more committed in the future. I am still very active on Goodreads otherwise. Mostly rating books and adding books to my reading lists.

<TEXT> My buddy and I are doing a book swap on Christmas this year so I want some suggestions on what he might like. 

Books he loves:

Ready Player One - His absolute favorite book. He loves the gaming aspect of it. Also the love story tied in. 

11.22.63 - says he's a sucker for love stories. 

Perks of Being a Wallflower- again, love story aspect of it. Straightforward writing that gets you emotionally involved. 

American Psycho - I think he likes stuff that depicts a lavish lifestyle like the life of Patrick Bateman...Money, wall street, clubs, girls, etc..not necessarily the all the fucked up stuff in it. 

Elon Musk: Tesla spacex and the quest for a fantastic future - He likes inspiring and motivational stories. He wants to start his own business one day and loves technology. Wants to make a boatload of money (don't we all). 

Harry Potter series- loves Harry Potter. This may be hard to match with the stuff above but thought I would mention. 

I understand most of this stuff doesn't mix well, but I wanted to include all I could to narrow down what he looks for in a book. I'm thinking something with technology/gaming with a love story would be great. 

I might try to read the book myself before making the purchase. So, what do you think Reddit?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah I think you will like it in that case. It's definately not horror by any means. You could always read a preview of the beginning on amazon or goodreads to get an idea. I would stay away from the TV adaptation until you read the book first, but I enjoyed both of them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just finished All Quiet on the Western Front today. I've gotta be honest, it's probably my favorite one I've read from my list so far.  The language used and description of the pain Remarque was able to accomplish while still making it simple to read was admirable. I won't get into much detail, but the part where Paul goes home on leave and describes how out of place he felt really struck me hard.     </TEXT>

<TEXT> I highly recommend 11.22.63 if you're intrigued by the topic and if you don't mind love stories. It does look like a brick of a book but it is a breeze to read while still including a lot of historical content. It has a feel about it that gives the younger generations an idea of what the overall lifestyle might have been like in the late 50's/early 1960's. 

I can't say that I'm all that well-read or anything, so I don't know that it stands up to powerful pieces of literature or anything, but it is a good story. I suppose if you have liked any other Stephen King works in the past you might like it. It's not known as a "scary" novel by any means, but some parts were rather eery to me due to the fact that someone is attempting to change a gigantic moment in U.S. history. 

I have heard a lot of great things about Jane Eyre so I will definitely keep that one in mind.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ive actually already started rating them on goodreads! However, I havent written reviews yet but I think your right, I definitely should. I guess its hard for me to come up with what I should say and I find it tedious. I'm really going to try to find time to do this though, even if they are very short reviews. 

I also wanted to create a list on goodreads with these titles, but it is apparently public. I dont want everyone editing it. Any suggestions on the best way to make a locked list on there? Maybe just create my own shelf?

Once I get better at using goodreads I will for sure share with you and the rest of r/books </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for all your suggestions. C P seems to have those vibes so i'm glad you told me that. I'm making a promise to myself that I won't be scared away from Dostoyevsky even if I don't like it. Ive seen many suggestions on this subreddit for Notes from Underground, The Idiot, and the Brothers Karamazov. 

Not what I was hoping to hear about American Psycho as I will be starting that soon. Its also interesting timing since I will be at the beach next week. Should be an odd read on the beach to say the least. I remember seeing the movie years back, but it has been quite some time and I dont really remember what happens.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, some of them I guess arent necessarily classics, and a few of them we added on afterwords that might not have been on those lists I mentioned. 

I tried to pick stuff that ive heard positive things about and also interest me. I thought if I included some of the classics you mentioned it might deter me from continuing with the list as some might be tough reads or be harder to get into. Things like the Oddysey, the Illiad, and Moby Dick intimidate me for some reason, even though they could be my favorite books and I just dont know it yet. I guess I also didnt want to make my buddy run away from the challenge by putting a bunch of historical classics in there. But they are definitely books I want to get to at some point in the future, I just figured they would be better off on a list that is completely my own.

Not gonna lie, Crime and Punishment is one that intimidates me but I thought I would give it a shot cause of reviews and the topic intrigued me. If I like what I read with that one theres no doubt I will check out others by Dostoyevski and also give Tolstoy a shot.

Luckly though, many of them are relatively shorter in length with only a few being over 400 pages. The few that are longer than that are the only ones that I'm worried about.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been intending on reading this ever since I saw the movie End of the Tour. It might be one of the first things I read after im done this list. 

I have a question for you though. Is the book relatively readable with characters that are easy to follow or is it more like the type of book that is hard to put all the pieces together and follow along? I seem to enjoy books the most when they suck me into certain characters and their different environments. Since it is a massive book, i'm hoping it will have that effect on me.  </TEXT>

This was the only book I left out of my intro. Now I kind of regret it. Incredible book. It really sent chivers down my spine because of the detail Capote put into the murderers.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-09-08 06:02:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It has been over 6 years since I graduated high school, and I'm still in school studying boring old textbooks to earn my second college degree. During that span of time, I thought that someone would have to pay me to get me to read outside of my schoolwork. I suppose I was too tired of staring at all these words for class, not to mention staring at a computer screen all day at work, and it was easier to lay down afterward and turn on the latest hit Netflix series. 

That was until recently.. For a couple of months during the summer I had no classes, freeing up a lot of time during my weekends. I was playing with my phone one morning and found a free trial of Amazon Unlimited-- so I decided to download the ebook of *1984* by George Orwell (Can't remember what made me pick that one but I knew it was considered a classic). The book completely sucked me in. I don't want to put out any spoilers, so lets just say that some of the story scared the shit out of me. After that, my college buddy mentioned he watched a cool tv series called *11.22.63*. I looked it up and found out it was also a Stephen King novel about JFK, time-travel, and altering history..woah..sounds like I could get into this. "Oh shit, the book is over 800 pages, I will never be able to get through this." Well, I checked this one out from a nearby library and decided to give it a shot. I couldn't believe how quickly I got engrossed in the story and didn't want to put it down. The storytelling by King made me feel like I was actually in the main characters shoes. Loving every minute of it, I finished that behemoth in only 2 weeks. I knew I needed to find another read fast to fill the void inside me that *11.22.63* left behind. Then, my best friend from my hometown suggested I read *Ready Player One* by Ernest Cline as it's one of his favorites (We're gamers at heart). This one..well this one was just flat out fun. I finished this one in another week's time. 

After telling my friend about how much I've enjoyed reading lately, he told me he was also looking to read more. We both wished we read more of those so-called classics back in high school and so on. So I suggested we do a reading challenge of some sort. Well, we decided to come up with our own list. He would pick 20 from a few online lists of highly regarded books and I would pick another 20. We both picked some of the same books, leading to us just filling out the list with a couple of our own choices. We picked our books from the following lists:

[Reddit's Favorite Books](https://www.reddit.com/r/raerth/comments/cpxkq/reddits_favourite_books/)

[Guardian's 1000 Books](http://www.listchallenges.com/guardians-1000-novels-everyone-must-read)

[and also here](http://www.loved.la/books/genre/Collections/1001_Books)

Once we had our 40, we shuffled the list and agreed to read them in the order they fall. So here is the final list. *drumroll*


**Book List**


* Cats Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut

* The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway

* Brave New World by Aldous Huxley

* All Quiet on the Western Front by Erich Maria Remarque

* American Psycho Bret Easton Ellis

* The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky

* Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury

* Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl

* And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie

* The Call of the Wild by Jack London

* Sirens of Titan by Kurt Vonnegut

* The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams

* Any Human Heart by William Boyd

* Cosmos by Carl Sagan

* Animal Farm by George Orwell

* One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey

* A Farewell to Arms by Ernest Hemingway 

* Watership Down by Richard Adams

* Walden by Henry David Thoreau

* East of Eden by John Steinbeck

* A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess

* The Giver by Lois Lowry

* Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck

* The Last of the Mohicans by James Fenimore Cooper

* A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine Lengle

* Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas by Hunter S. Thompson

* The Things They Carried by Tim OBrien

* The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald

* The Handmaids Tale by Margaret Atwood

* The Long Walk by Stephen King

* The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time by Mark Haddon

* The Stranger by Albert Camus

* To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee

* Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte

* Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky

* The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger

* Catch-22 by Joseph

* Lord of the Flies by William Golding

* Slaughterhouse-five by Kurt Vonnegut

* Post Office by Charles Bukowski



Our final list is interesting because he picked a lot of the ones you think of when you think about high school required reading and I picked more of the hidden gems that I first saw suggested here on Reddit. He also picked a few that I definitely read in high school; such as To Kill a Mockingbird, Lord of the Flies, Animal Farm, etc. However, I barely remember reading them and I sure as hell didn't appreciate them back then, so I look forward to reading them again. 

I thought I would share my story and post my list here to open a discussion about what everyone's thoughts are on the titles. Let me know some of your favorites you see listed, as well as ones you didn't care for. Please refrain from spoilers. 


**Final Notes**


It has been 2 weeks since we began the reading list and I am already on book number 4 -- *All Quiet on the Western Front* by Erich Maria Remarque. I am having a blast and learning so much already! Feel free to join in on our reading list and we can follow each other's progress! Can't wait to see what's to come on our list. 

**UPDATE 10/9/16** 

I have finished 5 more books since my initial post:

* All Quiet on the Western Front by Erich Maria Remarque

* American Psycho Bret Easton Ellis

* The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky

* Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury

* Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl

My favorites out of the bunch so far have probably been All Quiet on the Western Front, Perks of Being a Wallflower, and Man's Search for Meaning. But honestly, I have enjoyed them all so far, none that I would say I hated. 

**UPDATE 12/5/16** 

Checked off the following from my list

* And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie

* The Call of the Wild by Jack London

* Sirens of Titan by Kurt Vonnegut

* The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams

* Any Human Heart by William Boyd

My favorites from this group were And Then There Were None, Sirens of Titan, and Any Human Heart

AND as I waited for my friend to catch up I read some other great books:

* The Journey to the East by Herman Hesse (actually read this for school, but was pleasantly suprised) 

* Cannery Row by John Steinbeck 

* Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov

* Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes

* The Most Dangerous Game by Richard Connell. 

I convinced my buddy to start East of Eden next on our list even though its out of order.


I have been slacking on the written reviews but intend on doing more soon as well as upon finishing each book.

I managed to get it go through a couple times but it only pops up as those three songs on Spotify. Strange. I've tried resetting the cookies on my browser but no luck yet.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow! Thanks everyone for all the great feedback! I created this playlist a while ago mainly for my own listening pleasure. However, after hearing positive reviews from some friends I decided to share it on here for others to enjoy. It started out as a playlist of mostly recognizable rock/alternative songs and then I slowly started implementing some hip hop in there as well. The playlist will be updated regularly to my best ability. I will also be experimenting with more playlists of different genres and themes. Enjoy! </TEXT>
