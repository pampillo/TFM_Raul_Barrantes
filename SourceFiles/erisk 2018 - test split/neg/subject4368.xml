<TEXT> It's a sound design trick: if there's a gun on screen, it has to make a chambering sound. Helps the audience connect with the severity of the situation because guns, believe it or not, aren't the noisiest things in the world until you pull the trigger. Another example of this are tire screeching when there isn't braking, whoosh sounds and impact s for punches and that whistling sound for a bomb drop. These are instutions of sound design for film, they don't happen in real life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There was a Mormon girl I thought was really cute that came to my house one day. Normally Id either tell them to beat it or if get into some religious debate but not her. I don't know what I was thinking but I think I may have confused her Mormon niceness with flirting and the next thing I know we're in the garage and her and her friend are praying for me and I'm reading pages from the LDS. We're still friends on Facebook. She visited me last year. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've lived here roughly 6 years now. Apparently, while living here I have experienced dozens of "earthquakes", but in all honesty, I have no idea what an actual earthquake feels like. Most of the quakes I've experienced last but mere seconds. Half the time I assume either some hit the side of the house or a rocket launch or something. I keep hearing about all these Cali quakes but I have yet to really feel one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know it all too well. They use children not just as roadside bombs, but they even use them as human decoys. You'd hear stories downrange about how children would be instructed to run into traffic in an attempt to avert convoys into IEDs. So either the kid is successful and the convoy along with the child is obliterated or they don't see the kid (HMMWVs have terrible blind spots) and the child is ran over. When people make this comparison between us and them and say dumb shit like, "the US bombs mosques all the time so it's fine!" It infuriates me. We are nothing like these guys. Not even the same damn league. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just to be clear - firing upon a religious building of any kind is strictly forbidden under our Law of Armed Conflict. It doesn't matter who trained who or who did what. The point is the enemy we have in our midst doesn't play fair or by the rules - I believe its time that we stop fighting this fight in the middle East with our mens hands tied behind their backs.

Edit: I'm aware if they are using the church/mosque/hospital as a base of operations, it can be attacked. I actually said that in another post below just minutes after posting this one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also consider the realism aspect of King of the Hill. Unlike other adult cartoons, King of the Hill never utilizes the fact it's animated to create the humor. If you look at other animated programs like Family Guy, Simpsons, and pretty much any Adult Swim cartoon, much of the humor comes from showing crazy situations you really only could through animation. KOTH never does that, so when situations like this occur and everyone just goes along with it, it makes it so much funnier when you think that the show is trying to be as real as possible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What's really crazy is my pops was one of the first people to get Internet access at home. Back then, circa 1991, the internet just consisted of DOS based ASCII templates that people hosted and connected to. My dad would download all the best DOS games off of it. Nowadays, 2017, my dad doesn't have the forethought to research something on Facebook without posting it first. What's even crazier is that, while I don't think my dad is dumb guy for believing the things he posts, the actual kernal of truth most of the crap he posts about stem from are normally better suited for sharing than the altRight, info wars crap my dad floods his feed with. I remember my dad used to preach internet safety and protocol now he just doesn't seem to practice it anymore.

<TEXT> For the people asking: I did this in school. What we used was Photoshop; basically you dont change the picture, you simply select what region you want colored and you put an opaque colored filter over top of the selection. 38 seconds x 24 frames per second = 912 frames colorized. Could do it in a week I suppose. That's my guess. As far as I can tell, there's no software out there that will automatically colorize B W motion picture...

Instead it's just draining my battery to let me know "hey, you can play this game at 720p on a tiny screen... If you want."

<TEXT> I think it's a matter of getting it out there and getting it seen. Not saying that the static image isn't "enjoyable" however, if you can crank out about 100 episodes of those in the time it would take 1 of much higher quality (perhaps something with a budget, props and actors, sets, etc.) But since the market is FLOODED with absolute crap and YouTube can't tell the difference... Whats the point? He's right. I was doing the YouTube thing for years as a micro budget film maker and gave up on the platform altogether. It's impossible to trudge up that hill when it's filled with so much garbage content. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel this dude's pain. I do alot of buying, selling and swapping online. One forum I can't stand using are local Facebook selling forums. They're great if you want to unload something for a quick buck, but it always seems a hundred people want to ask you a hundred redundant questions about things they most likely don't intend to buy. I'm currently selling my old RPTV and 5.1 home theater for like $80 (just the home theater system alone is worth $180 easy.) And I swear the stupid questions I get are ridiculously dumb:

"How big is it?" "It's fucking huge as you can clearly see in the picture. Who cares - it's $80"

"Does it have HDMI input?" "No retard it's a rear projected television."

"Is it loud?" "It's a home theater so..."

"How much?" ""

And after answering all these questions, I assume they decide not to buy when I never hear from them again. It's not like it's a major life investment. I'm selling it for next to nothing... Do you want it or not I mean come on.

<TEXT> You also fail to realize that the wages illegal immigrants get paid is substantially less than livable and that if an employer was to hire legal, taxed workers, they'd have to pay them atleast minimum wage, which most are not equipped (or even willing) to do. It's not that Americans aren't willing to do the work - they're just not willing to do it for pennies on the dollar like illegal immigrants are. It's not that hard to get by on a less than standard wage if it's not taxed, your living expenses are covered and you basically live under the radar. 

Employers absolutely love hiring illegal immigrants not because they "do the jobs Americans won't do" but instead they'll "do any job and undercut the cost ". </TEXT>

<TEXT> Please do not get me wrong - I understand skill ceilings and game mechanics. Being from a long legacy of FPSs I can honestly say with pride I've been there since the beginning. Shit, my pops was one of the first people to download Wolfenstein 3d on Apogees old DOS based BBS modem server. I'm not a noob to Battlefield either, seeing as this is my 4th go into the franchise. Battlefield 4, with all its flaws, is a personal favorite.

My problem with BF1 is this game seems to just flat out not work correctly. It has very little if anything, I feel, with skill at all. Just to put this into perspective, I've spent the last 37 minutes just trying to get into a quick play... I shit you not. I know... Without a doubt... Now that I literally JUST got into match, it's going to be nothing but a giant buggy mess. My problems with the gameplay I was having earlier came after two months of just trying to get it to APPEAR on my screen :/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is the only game I've ever played where I feel like aim assist is either not working or working against me (IE lag... Perhaps I'm simply shooting dead air) I've done PC gaming in the past (grew up with Doom/Dukematch, Quake 4/ Arena, Unreal Tournament, etc) but being a console gamer at heart, never felt held back using thumbs to aim. Except this one particular game haha.

I'm only level 5 mind you, but I've been having such difficulty with this game already that I've already turned to Reddit for answers. The sniper I've been using SMLE MKIII Marksman with Chevron optic and 2.50 zoom. Not that those details mattered, but it took me roughly 6 minutes to bring up this damn solider screen so I thought I'd let you know. My most successful arm seems to be CeiRigotti Factory with Optics with only a measly 14 kills. I seem to jump back and forth between them but haven't found a groove with anything.

I'm beginning to suspect that for some reason I'm having a particularly hard time getting my console to communicate with the server's properly, which may be the root of my problems, but then again, I came to Reddit to get to the bottom of it all.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I for one am totally behind this deportation stuff. I live in a small suburban town in Central California that is surrounded by vast farmlands in which droves of illegal immigrants work on. Along with this came about a meth epidemic since alot of these guys came over here with addictions and will only work if they can get ahold of the stuff (they're out there from like 5 am to about 8 pm). Unfortunately, this has torn our community apart since meth is seen as a big business opportunity from larger neighboring cities and has made my small town a hot bed for meth labs and dealers :/ it's sad really. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I lived in South Korea for a year when I was in the Air Force. During orientation, we were told all the missle tests, nuke tests and saber rattling were in reality "cries for help". What's really happening is North Korea knows exactly what they're doing: they puff out their chests and dump all they're funds into military R D when state wide famine hits all time highs. Then they negotiate "disarmament" in lieu of foriegn aid. The neutral countries all meet with the  PRNK, SK and the US at the DMZ to discuss disarmament and funding, PRNK normally agrees to the tune of several million dollars to do away with their testing, they then take 75% of the aid, dump it back into their military, then give the remaining 25% towards other things (like feeding their citizens, fixing their infrastructure, etc.) And when the money is all gone, they turn around and break the disarmament agreement until more aid is discussed. They keep getting away with it because they keep China super close and.assume that if anything happens to them, China will get involved, which due to SK being a peninsula, they'd pretty much be screwed at that point. PRNK likes to pretend they have everything figured out and they're self sufficient but all they really do is extort money from first world countries to keep them from stupidly creating half assed nuclear warheads and basically killing everyone on the peninsula. Why China let's then get away with it.... I'll never understand. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd like to point out that very few Fallout fans that I know had anything bad to say about New Vegas. It was a masterpiece in my eyes and probably the best out of the FPS Fallouts. Fallout 4 felt like all the fun things like fluid and intertwining speech trees, exploration and cool, unique knick knacks scattered about the map were replaced with simplistic and insulting speech choices (high speechcraft literally does nothing but net you caps), focused and trailored exploration (very little to no incentive to explore) and the fact that finding a unique item or weapon felt meaningless when killing a random legendary ghoul could get you the exact same (or better) item. It made exploration feel empty and conversations always felt like I knew where it was going to go regardless of what I said. Even the choices you made until the end felt meaningless when it felt like no matter what you did the outcome didn't feel rewardng. Like the meme says, it's not a bad game. By no means is it bad. It's great. But definitely the weakest of the Fallout series. It's very neutered version of the series meant to pull in Fps players or kids that may not have touched a Fallout game otherwise. If anyone ever asked me, "is Fallout 4 any good?" I'll says, "Yea, but I recommend playing New Vegas if you haven't. It's the best one there is." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been solo queueing and lfg since I got the game a couple months ago. Most players I paly with say I have good stats (13 elim avg QP/22 elim avg COMP) and normally I try to match or come close (I'll play with 10s or 11s) but I still always feel like I'm doing all the work. For example, last comp match I played I did 40,402 damage and we still just drawed. I'm tired of this :/ I've been stuck at the same damn 2000 level I left placements with (all solo queueing). I'm looking for a group of decent players who may need a fairly good player (been playing fps since doommatch on modem circa 95ish?) Who is mature and capable but lacks a group a good friends to play with. 

I main DVA and Bastion and can play a mean 76. I also play Reinhardt if I have to. I'm not great but I can get the job done. I'm always looking to improve my game and I'm hoping to find some serious players.

Edit: I'm sorry this is for Xbox one!

<TEXT> YouTube is basically the Hollywood of the Internet, if you think about it. I think what it all boils down to is that someone is salty.  Someone made a comment along the lines that it's the equivalent of the stand up comedian doing clubs for years and never getting a break and then some kid blows up on the internet. I think that's why YouTube gets a bad rap. But don't act like there's not plenty of YouTubers out there that don't get the exposure they deserve. PewDiePie basically craps out mindless, dumb content now where someone like Roach the Human has been doing it for years, makes decent content and has virtually no subscribers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gladly.

All my life I grew up with guns. My dad taught me how to shoot and respect firearms at very young. While not a sharpshooter by any means, I did excel in marksmanship when I joined the Air Force in 2008.

 The US government holds federal level marksmanship competitions. Upon placing in the comps, service members are allowed to wear a special emblem on their uniforms to show off their skills. Since I was a decent shot, I decided to purchase the rifle used in the competitions to practice on my own time. The firearm? Our service weapon, the M16, better known as the AR15. I purchased myself a legal, semiautomatic rifle in the state of Georgia for the total sum of $1200 (after taxes). 

I got orders to Korea shortly after my purchase and since South Korea has no 2nd Amendment nor do they particularly care for guns, I had to leave mine in a storage facility. 

While overseas I received orders to California. All my possessions from GA were in one central storage facility, ready to be shipped to my next duty station after departing my OCONUS location. This was a problem - I was going to be shipping an illegal firearm over state line - AR15 rifles were strictly banned in 2012 CA. 

In comes the DOJ. Basically, since I was overseas I had to give power of attorney to someone else to go into my storage, disassemble the firearm, scatter the parts in several different shipping containers and throw away all my magazines (anything higher than 10 rds is illegal). 

After jumping through all the hoops, I legally transfered the firearm to CA. Now how to use the weapons, specially for competition practice (you know, what I bought it for) was a different story:

CA bans "assault weapons". What exactly an "assault weapon" in the state of CA is really a bit of a mess. There are specific brands of AR15s, for example, that no matter what may not be allowed in CA. Period. This is specifically for Colt and Bushmaster. Anything else in the AR15 catagoery in CA is still illegal if it has 2 "evil features" IE adjustable stock, pistol grips, foregrip, etc. But you could own offlist rifles if it didn't have a "detachable magazine". In comes the Bullet Button: a device that converts your illegal firearm to legal in a matter of seconds by basicaly making it slightly harder to get the magazine out. Ta-da. $15 and 10 minutes later I'm state legal. All is good in the world.

That's until Adam Lanza shot up Sandy Hook. Now all eyes are on my firearm, even though if I recall correctly he didn't even use one... He just owned one. Basically, a sweeping "assault weapons" ban was in the works ala 1994, basically looking outlaw the firearm altogether. Additionally, what some people weren't discussing were the "mental health" reforms that were in being discussing. Specifically how people with a history of mental disorders were going to barred from owning firearms. Well this sounds DS all fine and good until you realize that what exactly means "poor mental health" is ambiguous at best. Needlessly to say, Obama's gun ban never happened.

I seperated from the service a year ago and started going to school full time. I currently collect VA disability for a string of panic attacks I've had since leaving Iraq in 2010. Nothing is essentially wrong with me: I'm not violent or crazy, I just have a hard time sleeping and I have bouts of forgetfulness. However, I would have fallen under the barring lists under Obama's orders. An 8 year war veteran, unable to practice their second amendment rights to fire a gun in a federal competition... Because the president says no. Sounds insane huh? Except it happened. At state level. In California.

Introducing what was known as "gunmaggedon" by Californians, that are laws that basically took the second amendment and tossed it out the window and overnight had me in violation of state laws that took immediate effect. It was pretty much exactly what Obama had wanted nationwide. What's funny is this was all some kneejerk legislation written up by a harsh critic of gun violence that was later found out to be running guns for the cartels and later ended up on Jerry Browns desk, signed with his own hand and forced down all our throats. There's so much to the current bans it's ridiculous and does nothing to fix what it's supposed to. Just Google it.

Tl;Dr new guns laws bad for gun owners. Liberals don't care. New Trump's laws bad for immigrants. Liberals lose their shit. Both are in violation of sovereign human rights (in my eyes, an inherent right to work, live comfortably and defend yourselves is extremely important to mankind) but we as humans pick and choose which ones seem acceptable based off of personal bias and morality rather than logic and human development. </TEXT>

Some of these are really good, too! Dead End was great (Alien, Predator and Batman!?). City of Scars and Shattered Cowl was awesome too. Took a look at some that didn't have as many views as well like Batman Dante and Suburban Knight. Both were excellent as well but not as many views. So made me think - what are some other really good Batman fan films? Seems like alot of it is word of mouth so what better place to ask than Reddit! </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's funny considering the same legislation was passed here in CA and it basically made me a criminal overnight. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not left nor right leaning. I find fallicy in both parties and I find people who stick to the far leaning policies for either party to be incredibly simple minded. This being said - call my argument a red herring. Call it whatever you want. It will not change the fact that a Nobel Peace Prize recipient orchestrated the biggest and farthest reaching drone strike campaign in world history, responsible for civilian causalities in the hundreds and proceeded to sell the American public the idea that the wars in the Middle East were winding down (they're not btw. If anything we just moved everything around). Oh and please before you go off on a tangent about our "rights", Obama on several occasions tried to pass some bullshit legislation tied to our 2nd Amendment rights on several occasions, that every left leaning liberal I knew seemed to jump for joy at, even when it made criminals out of American citizens. These things all seem unrelated, but in truth, I'm simply pointing out the hypocrisy in the modern liberal. The far right is just as batshit crazy and confused as the left, they just don't seem to whine as loudly.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love how the left is all like "America was never great." And "I'm gonna move to Canada if Trump's elected." But now this happens and it's all "America was built on freedom! This isn't what America's about!" Seems like the left will side with whatever side seems hold the moral high ground. To hell with convictions, amirite? Hopefully that Canadian visa you guys were collectively working on doesn't get denied. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Obama drone bombed the shit out of the middle East for 8 years and I never saw out of the american public so much as a single complaint. You want to talk about inconvenience? Try being dead. Sure this new policy is terrible. Don't get me wrong. But why does it seem like Trump can do no right, but Obama can do no wrong (atleast in the eyes of a liberal). Trump's not been in office a week and everyone's jumping down his throat. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I loved this game so much! I was hesitant to get it at first. Doom 3 was too slow for my tastes and since Duke Nukem Forever, I don't really buy into these rehashings. Then I saw this guy on youtube do a review on it. After that I was hooked. Wish I could remember the channel - the video was great: he ran around his apartment or whatever shooting demons with a shotgun. It was great! :D Now its gonna bug me until find the video... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Special RX with Michael Rappaport and Josh Peck. I saw it around the same time as Kick Ass came to theaters. It follows same guideline almost: Regular Joe Schmo comics nerd decides to fight crime. What makes this one unique is how everything is presented as he gets his powers and decides what to do with them; all the while the audience is unaware whether or not it's all in his head or it's really happening, and the editing is superb with funny moments interspliced in the dramatic moments. Add a dash of science fiction and time travel and you have one hell of a budget superhero movie. Even with movies like Super and Kick Ass and other "homegrown" hero archetypes in films, this one truly shines on its own. It got some bum reviews apparently on release but I don't see why - it's fantastic. I'd like to see a YouTube review on it personally. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Speaking of low budget time travel films I found this short one on YouTube awhile back that doesn't look like it hadn't had much of a budget at all 
https://youtu.be/uHywX3DbLRQ it's not horribly long. The FX are pretty cool for being no budget. </TEXT>
