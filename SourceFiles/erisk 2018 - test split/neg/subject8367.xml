<TEXT>  It took a median of 4.2 years after the drugs were approved for these safety concerns to come to light, the study found, and issues were more common among psychiatric drugs, biologic drugs, drugs that were granted "accelerated approval" and drugs that were approved near the regulatory deadline for approval.

Damn. I was assuming the issues came to light just after approval, when they were used for the first time outside clinical trials. 4 years is a long time to not know about safety issues.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes exactly, the 1 confirmed painting by Caravaggio has a rectilinear trajectory and was painted before Galileo introduced the theory. The others (by known artists) all have a parabolic trajectory and come after the theory. This leaves the unknown painting (supposedly Caravaggio) with a parabolic trajectory in a strange place.

This by no means confirms that it isn't Caravaggio but it's certainly an interesting perspective.  </TEXT>

Experts believe the canvas was painted between 1600 and 1610, and that it could be the work of the Italian master Caravaggio. However, this belief is disputed and is currently being investigated by the Louvre Museum in Paris. </TEXT>

 RG: Has climate change played a role in this?

 Barnard: Yes, in addition to the record sea surface temperatures which lead to highest number of hurricanes ever recorded, climate change influenced this extreme El Nio event, which are expected to become more frequent due to climate change. 

 This event coincided with a major drought in California, conditions predicted for the 21st century by most climate models. Higher sea levels also accompanied this El Nio event, including a recent acceleration along the US West coast, which exacerbated impacts.

<TEXT> I really like this quote:

Once you place religious experience in the context of brain reward circuits, it suggests that religious training can induce feelings of reward in response to doctrines or ideals or religious leaders. There's no reason one can't suppose that any doctrine from "love your neighbor" to "follow your leader" to "inflict violence on the out-group" might not be trained to induce reward. It may be that a Lutheran woman in Minnesota and an ISIS follower in Syria might experience the same feelings in the same brain regions for completely different belief systems, with very different social consequences. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Although the pangolins scales are the most prominent symbol of that uniquenessno other mammal has themthe eight species all share several other physical and behavioral characteristics.

This is a direct quote. 

Edit for a few more direct quotes:

 Its a lucrative business with devastating consequences. Pangolins are prized both for their meat (and blood), which is considered a delicacy, and for their scales, which are used in traditional medicinesdespite the fact that pangolin scales are made of keratin, the same substance as human fingernails.

Oh another

Nguyen and IUCN reports suggest that you neednt look far to find pangolin meat being offered on restaurant menus and their scales being sold as remedies for everything from ulcers to acne, particularly in China and Vietnam. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  When the Assad Regime first deployed chemical weapons (CW) in Damascus on August 21, 2013, President Barack Obama called the international communitys credibility in question if they did not act in defense of the international norm. Despite this and becoming a member of the Chemical Weapons Convention two months after the first attack, the use of chemical weapons in Syria has continued. The latest attack happened on September 6th.

 We spoke to Richard Price, University of British Columbia about the chemical weapons taboo. Price is a leading expert on international norms and has written about the subject in The Chemical Weapons Taboo and for Foreign Affairs. </TEXT>

He and his team built a predictive model to estimate how quickly mammals can spread from their native habitats and whether they will be able to outpace the rate of climate change. We talked to him to find out why his estimate is likely to be conservative, and what we can do to mitigate the negative effects climate change could have on animals.  </TEXT>
