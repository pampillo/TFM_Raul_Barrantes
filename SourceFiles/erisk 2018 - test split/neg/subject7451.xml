<TEXT> Wouldn't argue it with me.  I'd think too it's a mark of a good coach who can get his team to do that.  Not sure they melted down in 2015 as much as Romo made that much of a difference to the team.  He'd pretty much done that throughout his career.  Shame he may never be recognized for it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You know what--I was basing my opinion on everything up to 2016.  No other team at all was interested in him after 2014, when they went 12-4.  Back then I seemed to be a lone voice in the woods saying that Garrett was the Cowboys' last best chance at relevance in my lifetime, because he's the only person Jerry listened to, and Jerry would drive off anyone who was competent.

But I wonder if, now that Garrett's won NFL Coach of the Year, opinions are changing.  

I fear that his reputation may never actually cement as a good one until he overachieves; that may be what it takes to pull him out from Jerry's shadow--heck, to pull the whole team out from Jerry's shadow.

In any event, as we both agree that Jerry won't fire him anytime soon, what other teams think is all academic.

I do think the team's better now that Jerry's not making personnel decisions.  That seems like a no-brainer.  But until we actually see sustained success, well, the jury's still out.  Of course maybe the jury's out on every coach until he does something like Landry, or Belichick, or Noll.  Anyhow, cheers, bud, and points well made.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What will it take to for us to retain him? 

No other team in the NFL would hire him.  This is not to say that he's a bad coach, but that, until he actually demonstrates sustained achievement in the W-L column, he'll continue to be viewed as Jones's puppet.  Only people who've been following this team closely recognize the extent to which he's professionalized football operations.

Also no indication that Jones will fire him.  Jones has said for years--since Garrett was paid the big bucks as an assistant--that he wants Garrett to be his Landry.  Times were different, but it took Landry a while to start winning consistently too.  So short of a complete meltdown, which, frankly, isn't conceivable right now, Garrett will be here for a while. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The NFL is probably the most reactive (as opposed to proactive) major sports league there is.  It does not lead in *any* social policy.  Accordingly, it won't change its stance toward marijuana use until the entire country does.  The U.S. is headed in that direction, but until it arrives, the NFL will continue to view marijuana as a harm.  Which is a shame, because among all major sports marijuana use would seem to be most useful to the NFL.

Still, as long as it's banned, every player has a choice.  It's a shame what its use has done to Gregory's career (destroyed it). </TEXT>

<TEXT> No dispute.  My impression is that everyone's high on Watt due to his genetics.  Maybe they'll both turn out to be Hall of Famers, but I think both the Cowboys and Steelers reached on those two.

Remember, though, people characterized Frederick as a reach.  We have to be careful when we evaluate drafts based on so-called *value*.  In my view, the value of a pick is based almost entirely on unprovables, such as what a different team might have done, and on retrospect.  Generally (again, in my view), the true value of a pick can't be determined until possibly years later.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Generally I'm hoping for the best, just like you, bud.  But remember: his "production" was based on one year as a starter.  His 2-year numbers are not nearly as impressive--e.g., he had more sacks in 2016 than in his prior 3 years combined.  And he wasn't a starter before 2016.

Probably no one will disagree that Charlton, at least at this moment, appears to have been a reach--a necessary one, but still a reach.  But he's got the best DC in the NFL coaching him, so if he's ever to fulfill his potential it'll be with the Cowboys.

In drafting him, almost certainly the FO was making the best of a bad hand and relying on Marinelli. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think he meant T.J. Watt?

And for what it's worth a couple of things: not sure anyone's arguing with your opinion about the applicability of 40 time to chasing down plays; it's your opinion that he isn't athletic and is just big that's causing disagreement.  

For example, I haven't read any scouting report that describes him as *nonathletic and just big*.  To the contrary, the reports I've read say generally that while he lacks certain elite tools and polish, he *is* athletic and has an upside.  (E.g., your own link describes him as athletic.)

Also, your observation about burst and quickness may be valid, but you have to realize that subbies generally don't like negatives mentioned about Cowboys' players.  So while you may be right, and definitely you should explain it, probably better just to realize you're not going to succeed in an argument and let it go.  Doesn't mean your observations aren't appreciated, as others do like to consider all sides to a situation. 

Generally, though, it's hard to change someone's mind when he says he trusts the FO.  That's a fan simply saying he's a fan.

Bottom line is subbies rarely (not never, just rarely) convince each other of anything, from what I can tell. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah but I think it's right.  You have to remember that this site has grown into something far more than what it was originally; originally it was a place just to centralize news.  The community came afterward.

And as dumb as what the mod here is doing, the idea that community consensus would result in the removal of a mod isn't that great a solution either.  Anyone on reddit any length of time is familiar with dozens of stories in which witch hunts led to unfortunate outcomes.  

Luckily this kind of thing hasn't happened that much.  But the solution doesn't seem to be available on reddit.  When a community of any significant size encounters a mod who's doing something unreasonable, the only solution the community has is the same as a community of 6: start a new sub.  Which of course isn't a solution at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You don't say anything about your family's financial status, but my guess is that to your parents $800 is a lot of money, and your parents don't want you to waste it.  They may not appreciate that you might understand how to do something that they don't; they may not appreciate that intellectually you're ready to try this; they may not understand that by trying to protect you they're actually wasting money they don't have to spend.  But they certainly appear to be more than willing to waste *their* money for the sake of helping you.

Being a teenager is difficult, both for the teen, who feels (and sometimes, not always, is right) that he's capable of thinking for himself, but also for the parent, who's not always sure when to expand limits and when to keep a tight hold.  Realize: to them it was only yesterday that you were in diapers learning how to eat with a spoon.  (Heck some teenagers still haven't mastered that trick (ha)).

You have many options, but my suggestion is that you (1) take a deep breath; (2) realize they're not trying to strangle you, but to help you; and (3) maybe do as /u/Snorkle25 says, ask them to watch something with you, and show them one of the clearer, more reputable videos about how to build a system.  

Maybe you even could ask them to help you consider parts--use pcpartspicker, show them a couple of builds, educate them, ask them what they think, spend time sharing your love of computers with them; let them *see* what you are capable of.  You might be surprised how much most concerned parents would love to be included in your life.

This is what adults do, you know, at least when we're at our best: we behave rationally.  Show them you can.

Sometimes as an adult you get more accomplished by being patient and softspoken, and considering your opponent's views than by trying to ramrod through what you want.

Handled correctly, this may actually be an opportunity for you and your parents to learn quite a bit about each other.  And about yourselves.

Not everything has to be confrontational.

<TEXT> Of course.  Duane Thomas, Thomas Henderson, a whole host of bad draft choices that led to the Cowboys' collapse in the late 80s, including most notoriously Rod Hill, who may be the only player in competition with Claiborne as the worst draft choice in Cowboys' history.

Among other gems, Thomas once asked, "If the Super Bowl is the ultimate game, why do they play another one next year?"

And Henderson (in)famously once said, "Terry Bradshaw is so dumb he couldn't spell 'cat' if you spotted him the c and the a."  Unfortunately for him, he said this right before Bradshaw's Steelers  beat the Cowboys in a Super Bowl.

And Hill's selection was the one that started the whispers that the NFL had passed Schramm by. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's kind of faint praise, though; in the 15 years before Jerry was notoriously awful at drafting.  Heck, a monkey and a dart board would do better than he did.

Still you bring up an interesting point: I'd love to see a comparison of how teams have done over the years at drafting.  Seems like fans would be crying out for something like this.  Let's get some numbers to compare so we don't just have to huff and puff with nothing to back us up!

<TEXT> My children are 10 and 7.  Every day with them has been better than the last.  They are the center of my life, the culmination of all that's gone before.

They're bright, sassy kids, filled with confidence.  Also, I think to a significant extent because we've spent so much time with them, they're somewhat advanced academically.

My 10 year old is in a k-12 school; in addition to his regular 5th-grade classes he's taking Algebra I and has perfect 100s in everything.  He's going to be the first 10 year old in state history to be allowed to sit for a state high-school level exam (to get credit for having taken the course). 

His school has said they'll let him take Geometry/Algebra II next year simultaneously, and his principal has said he probably should take other high school classes.  She's suggested that we should consider helping him graduate early, but I'm not so interested in rushing him through childhood.  As long as he's interested/challenged in school work and learning, that's good enough for me.  In any event, I've been in touch with a local university about allowing him to take Calculus there in 8th grade.

Because of what he's doing, he gained a lot of notoriety this year the first time a 9th-grade girl said hi to him.  So he's also learned a lot about how to handle social visibility.  Another cool thing he's learned already is that, while other kids may start off viewing him as kind of a circus monkey, over time, simply by being who he is, he can transform their views through his kind and gentle spirit.  He describes himself as happy, and he's serene and thoughtful.  Every teacher seems to know him, and most students, too, apparently, as they're often asking him to help with their math.

My 7 year old is following in his footsteps, as she'll be completing 4th grade math this year.  She'd grown up watching him do extra math, so before she even started school she'd wanted to start studying it.  In contrast to him, she's emotional, dramatic, generous.  Everywhere she goes her teachers--whether in school, dance, tae kwon do, softball--adults describe her as a leader, and children do seem to flock to her.  The two of them describe each other as their best friends.  I don't know how long that will last--we do emphasize it a lot--but the longer it lasts I figure the better the chance they'll be friends as adults.

I'm an older parent, and these two have given me a goal: live to see who they become.  

I genuinely feel blessed every day to be their dad. </TEXT>

But if there's anything I've seen in my 40+ years watching politics in the U.S., it's that events have a way of spiraling out of control, and when it comes to partisan loyalties and threats to one's own position, ultimately it's every man for himself.

In other words, if/when the GOP starts to realize their own seats are at risk, they'll turn on him in a heartbeat. </TEXT>

Park attitude at the door, follow the rules, message mods privately instead of publicly criticizing them (which is usually off-topic anyway), pursuant to the concept of *praise publicly, critique privately*, and you almost never will have any trouble.  At least I never have--as a user, anyway.  I mean *never*.

*Praise publicly, critique privately* is a great rule to follow in life, too.

<TEXT> Agreed.  But I don't think this has anything to do with religion.  Instead, we allow faith to be politicized when politics confirm our biases.  We also often use our interpretation of faith to confirm our biases.

There was a study not too long ago which showed that one's ideas about authority actually was the strongest correlation found so far as to whether a person was to lean conservative or liberal.  Christians in particular are susceptible to confusing beliefs as to authority (God almighty vs. all-loving/forgiving God) with political biases.

There are *many* applications of the verse describing Satan as a roaring lion seeking whom it may devour.  Politics is just one more path on which Satan can feed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the apparent absence of any interest by the GOP-controlled Congress to reign in this lunatic's behavior, only an aggressive media and court system will stop Donald Trump from ruining what it has taken many people far greater than him hundreds of years to build.  May the US media learn what German reporters already understand: a liar and divisive person is not a good leader for a nation. </TEXT>

His utterly indefensible rantings have real consequences, and they're going to be on the GOP's heads for not stopping them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bodies are really the issue here, as not a one of the 4 starters the Cowboys lost is worth the money the signing teams have paid/will pay them.  Claiborne in particular, if you ask me, is the most disappointing draft pick in Cowboys history.  And Carr never lived up to his paycheck.

I expect the Cowboys to keep working the FA market to make up the losses.  Then it'll be a question of how the draft shakes out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bob Lilly for me.  Most of today's fans don't realize.  But Bob Lilly was the best defensive lineman I've ever seen.  Important to realize he played before sacks were a thing.  But he was dominant on the line in a way that no one has been since.  He was better than Randy White.  That's how good he was.

He was triple-teamed most of his career.  But it simply didn't matter. 

All-NFL (the equivalent of All-Pro) 6 straight years--and 7 out of 8.  And second-team All-Pro for 2 additional years.  All-Decade team for *two* decades.

11-time Pro Bowler.

 *He was the best*.

He instantly would make the defense fearsome.  He was that good. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nah.  He was fired by the office of the President, whereas any investigation would be against Trump personally for, in effect, abuse of office--or conduct before he entered office.  There'd be no conflict.

That said, there's no way in heck he'd be appointed, as the last thing the GOP wants is to disturb its golden goose.  Right now it's playing the line between not disturbing the status quo so it can enact its agenda and fearing the effect of its lack of enforcement on 2018. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a verified dealer, I would like your opinion.  I'm looking to buy 2 bats for use in ASA core 52  leagues.  Generally I'm a power hitter who prefers balanced bats.

I was heartbroken last year when Easton refused to recertify its SCN-3s.  I had 2, a 30 and a 28, that I'd used for years.  They were incredible.  But so now I'm looking for new ones.

So far I've narrowed the search to the 2016 Demarini Flipper Aftermath OG (28), the 2017 Demarini Raw Steel (30), and the 2017 Miken DC-41 (30).  Would you be able to rank those in terms of quality?

Also, a question I haven't been able to find answered anywhere, what would you say is the best one-piece balanced bat?

I realize it's all subject to opinion, but that's why I'm asking yours!  Thank you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The GOP supports Trump because it doesn't want anything to interfere with its long-sought-after opportunity to enact its agenda. This is why Trump is naming all the old cronies to head the various agencies.  The GOP has wanted at least since the days of Reagan to enact a pro-business anti-working-person agenda.  And now it's finally gotten the chance.

No one wants to stand up against Trump because (1) s/he would be attacked by Trump's goons; and (2) the GOP routinely has marched in lockstep since the days of Clinton.

Like its agenda or not, the GOP has learned how to function as a party.  Generally to the detriment of the nation, but the Dems would improve their strategy if they simply started doing what the GOP does in terms of gerrymandering, propaganda, and solidarity.

Instead, it's clear the Dems still haven't learned their lesson, as seen by the fact that a number of them voted to affirm Perry as head of the EPA.

If we're lucky, Dems may have to learn, as the Town Halls do seem to represent a grassroots uprising which is long overdue.

<TEXT> Mexican flag flair would be a great idea.  We would've responded to the suggestion of a poll a lot sooner if someone simply had messaged us about it.  But now that the idea's come up, I'm going to put one up.

As an aside, a lot of the time when users get frustrated at our policies, it occurs when they haven't bothered to message us.  We don't catch every reference in threads, and we're actually pretty open to ideas.  As long as they're sent to us via the mechanism reddit has provided for exactly that purpose: modmail. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep.  There are *many* instances in which the US and states, by [statute](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity_in_the_United_States), have waived sovereign immunity, and individual actions can be reached via the stripping doctrine.  Additionally, counties and municipalities, including administrative agencies, are not protected by the doctrine.

Further, as it's an affirmative defense whose applicability must be shown by the defendant, no attorney worth the license ever would let the doctrine serve as a reason not to add the US or a state as a defendant.  Mostly it's a concept that law students bring up when they don't understand trial practice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This also helps explain why Christianity may have flourished in authoritarian societies: you should separate yourself from the world--not only because as a typical person you're powerless to change it, but also because you shouldn't try, except by smaller, relatively nonpolitical acts such as kindness, witness, and sacrifice, which don't directly threaten the status quo at all. 

And why Christians could be persecuted when the sheer volume/nature of their beliefs proliferate, to the point where they threaten the established powers.  

And why, when demagogues of a certain flavor arise, Christians support them, because instead of offering choices, they simply demand, and notwithstanding their personal foibles (sexism/racism/greed), because who should cast the first stone?

This is the subtext of [Matthew 22:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A20-22 version=KJV), right?  Let the powerful do what they will--obey them, give to them, render to them--because your treasure is in heaven.

It's  powerfully nuanced interaction.  Which gives rise to good and evil, but as a Christian who believes in authority you're almost forced to think that the evil comes from an "other", and if it's not the figure of authority, it must be an evil/outside force (Satan, or maybe liberals, which must by definition be influenced by Satan).  

It certainly can't come from your capitulation, as you call that *salvation*. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [This article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/02/01/how-your-parenting-style-predicts-whether-you-support-donald-trump/?utm_term=.92623f8b5206) suggests that you're considering the issue the wrong way.  I.e., it's not about rationality at all, but about one's views on authority.

It's easy to see why authoritarianism would allow a person to reconcile both positions-- sexual abstinence outside of lawful marriage and a respect for the laws governing immigration.  So to people who support specific approaches to sex and against illegal immigration, their positions aren't inconsistent at all: they respect authority.

Unfortunately, it seems, they do this even when authority doesn't deserve it, or when their approaches cause inconsistencies in other areas.  My guess is that they view the inconsistencies not as signs that the authority is wrong, but that they themselves either are weak (sinful) or simply don't understand all the intricacies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No one can answer this except you.  But what I can tell you, apparently from the other side of life, is that very few can predict the paths of their lives, and the measure of a man is not whether he has made mistakes, but what he does once he has.  You will define yourself as much by what you don't do as what you will.

There is no right or wrong answer except this: in your circumstances, assuming you live to it, in 14 years you will be 14 years older, regardless of whether you stay in school.  So the real question is: in 14 years, what will you wish you had done?

If you can't answer that, certainly no one else can.

I wish you well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Trump's approval rating is 39%, the lowest of any President at this stage of his Presidency in U.S. history.  Either you believe that 61% of the U.S. is "liberal", clearly demonstrating that the right-wing isn't the dominant demographic, or it's a lot more than *this subreddit/huffpo/vox/motherjones* that's freaking out about Trump.

Or of course with no evidence whatsoever you could claim that the poll is "fake".  But that would suggest you yourself are caught up in a bias.  Sad!

<TEXT> Given Trump's fragile ego, I wouldn't be surprised if, after enough bad news and accusations have built up, he simply resigns.  If his Presidency continues, I don't see *any* time in which he won't bring these kinds of threats upon himself.

Consider: he's wrecked his brand, exposed himself as a fraud and liar, and is the most disliked President in the history of the U.S.--all within the first 3 weeks.

If he doesn't resign, at some point the GOP is sure finally to have had enough of this incompetent demagogue.  They'll milk him for everything they can in the meantime.  But if enough hostile town halls occur, they'll start to worry that he's wrecking *their* brand.  And that'll be that.

<TEXT> Thing is, take a look at [the first bill](http://www.vox.com/2017/2/14/14617312/trump-transparency-oil) he's signed.  It doesn't help *us*.  It helps oil companies.  Of course he'll sell it as *cutting back regulations*.  But sometimes regulation is good, particularly when it limits unfettered capitalism from harming the greater good.

But, you know, given what you've said about yourself, how you present yourself, more important to me than Trump or whoever is how you can learn to view and consider what politicians say.

Main thing, going forward, over the next 30 years or so, try to consider why politicians are telling you things, who's paying their way into office, who stands to benefit.  Not from what they say, but from what they do.  Get past the puffery and look at what's real, what's happening.  Test/question everything--particularly the things that might seem most sensible to you; try as little as possible to take fixed positions on anything.

The reality in the US is that the influence of money on campaigns has corrupted our system, and SCOTUS has disrupted every attempt, no matter how minimal, to limit it.  So we face an ever-increasing imbalance as our so-called leaders rely on us for votes but big money from multinationals to advertise to us.

Question becomes: who do they really represent?  We're stuck with bad choices.  But above all, don't let politicians lie to you.  Seek always the truth, even if it contradicts your biases (which of course means you have to become aware of them).  Politics is no time for tribalism--which is counterintuitive, because that's *exactly* when so many these days say it is time.

Cheers, kiddo.  (And I mean that affectionately, coming from the other side of life.) </TEXT>

And, of course, unlike with Russia's interference with the election, there's no evidence whatsoever that Hilary encouraged any tampering.  And it is striking that the same Congress which became so apoplectic about the email server is almost dead-silent about this issue.  

Remember, though: I couldn't care less about R/L or partisan BS.  So please don't think I'm apologizing for Hilary.  Those people *all* are using us to their advantage.  I'm just trying to see what's real and what's not.  I understand you may disagree.  More power to you. </TEXT>

They're all wealthier than we are--some born to money--and not a one of them can have any idea what it's like to scrape from paycheck to paycheck, worrying about student loans, car payments, health insurance (remember--Congress gets better than we get--*for free*) or any of the many other things normal people worry about.  This isn't to say that we shouldn't support people who *show* they actually support our values.  But lip service doesn't count.

And I didn't see how Hilary, Trump, or most of the other people who were running for President did.  And I still don't see how Trump does.  

And I don't see how the majority of Congress does, because any majority that refuses to investigate what's going on with this guy is risking the health of the U.S. for its own political gain.  Which is not why they were voted into office.

<TEXT> First, I'm at work so I don't have time to provide the sources for what I'm about to say.  Apologies in advance for that.  Also, I'm guessing that you'll disagree with pretty much everything I'm about to say.  That's okay; I'm not trying to convince you of anything; I'm just going to try to answer your question.  

I respect that you have a position, but I see no purpose in arguing about any of this, because as far as I know, neither you or I have any idea of what's actually transpired.  However, as you seem to be trying to figure out why someone might come to a conclusion which seems so opposite of yours, I'll give it a try.

Also, though, please understand that I didn't think either candidate was particularly good, and I wasn't a fan of Obama, particularly, so this is not a L/R thing for me at all.  Instead, I believe in the concept of civics as represented best by bipartisan agreement instead of attack.  Party over country is to me a disgraceful concept.  This means I've been dismayed by U.S. politics for some 30+ years.

All of that said, I have been deeply alarmed by Trump's attacks via Twitter on pretty much anyone who disagrees with him, his constant misrepresentation of facts, no matter how trivial, his obvious reversals on many of his campaign promises, including, most specifically, his appointments of numerous people connected to Wall Street when he expressly negatively characterized Hilary as being beholden to Wall Street, his perpetual attacks on the integrity of the judiciary and the very security apparatus which informs his office, his propensity to try to learn about the world from TV and not from experts, his apparent desire to leverage his position for personal gain at the expense of the Constitution, his apparently illegal appointment of Bannon onto the Security Counsel....I could go on.  

But I've yet to see anything whatsoever suggesting that Trump is behaving presidentially--that he even understands what it means.  I say this because if he did have that understanding, he would recognize that the words he says as President are more important than the words you or I might say; they have a global effect.  And a person who simply wants to destroy, without any regard for the intricacy of the world order which has been built up over decades, is, frankly, scary.  Because a lot of very smart people have developed this system, and so far it's kept us from destroying ourselves, which very much is within the realm of our capabilities.

Additionally, however, to answer your question, I've read many of the same reports I'm guessing/hoping you have, regarding the reports that Russia was involved in the campaign, the Rosneft transaction, the reports of Trump's interactions with Putin, his denials of said interactions, his comments suggesting that the U.S. is as bad as Russia, his efforts to convince Abe to accommodate Putin, the reports from Kushner's own paper suggesting that the CIA no longer wants to advise Trump as to security matters due to their concern that he has been compromised, and the suggestions that the only reason a rational person would behave the way he has is if he is being blackmailed or is in cahoots.  

Further, to me there seems to be zero-percent chance that anything Flynn said when he discussed the sanctions hadn't been approved by Trump.  He is, in his resignation, falling on his sword on behalf of his failed attempt to see to the President's agenda.

All of the above suggests to me that at the very least there are significant questions as to why Trump has presented himself the way he has with respect to Russia--and as many others have come to believe, the only rational explanation seems to be that Putin has something on him.  That's how Putin operates.

There's simply too much at stake for the health of this nation to ignore the possibility that he's been compromised by a foreign power. </TEXT>

*It's not clear to what extent the 35-year-old Kushner will divest himself financially from the business.*  He simply claimed that he planned to stop operating as publisher and to transfer the shares to a family trust, of which, of course, he himself could be trustee.

<TEXT> My question would be: why do you think you even need an opinion on this issue if you're not gay?  God will be the judge of all of us--not you or anyone else.  You get what I'm saying?  Worry about your own sins.

(Understand I'm not attacking you.)

I think we get too caught up in concerning ourselves about what others are doing; we will not be judged on others' lives, but on our own.  This was one of the primary lessons in that great story beginning at [John 8:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+8%3A3-10 version=KJV).

Too often we think we need answers to every question.  Faith is not a textbook.  

Maybe it's a function of age that I no longer think I need the answer to everything.  Or maybe it's just a recognition of my own fallibility.  But there is enough in the day simply trying to live my own life without worrying about other people's.

I've found that [the first and great commandment and the second](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A35-40 version=KJV) leave no room for anything else. </TEXT>

At least theoretically, it is the role of the People, through their representatives in the government, to restrict individuals from enacting the tragedy of the commons.  This is how civics operate.

Which isn't to suggest that the Dems haven't also become beholden to lobbyist money.  But generally yeah the market has shown itself to be pretty poor at regulating corporate behavior.

Because there are *innumerable* examples of Canada, Switzerland, and France valuing cash in all kinds of ways over human life.  To name a few, Canada with its oil pipelines, Switzerland with its refusal to join the EU, France with its failure to commit the resources necessary to combat youth unemployment, on and on.

In healthcare, absolutely I agree with you.  The US is beholden to money.  The entire healthcare system, from insurers to providers to pharmaceutical companies, all are enthralled by the dollar.  It's a disgrace.

<TEXT> It's obvious he hasn't divested himself of his business interests.  Accordingly he's in violation of the emoluments clause.  He's also receiving [payments from foreign governments](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/01/26/trump-is-getting-payments-from-foreign-governments-we-have-no-idea-what-they-are/)--and there is strong indication that he excluded numerous Arabic countries from his ban [specifically because he has business interests in them](http://www.forbes.com/sites/datadesign/2017/02/01/mapping-president-trumps-travel-ban-vs-his-business-interests-in-muslim-countries/#7b9363b52fb0).  Further, if his involvement with Putin and Rosneft is correct, he's committed treason.  At the very least, all of that suggests conflicts of interest which may demonstrate his lack of qualification for the office.  In that regard, fascinating that he's gotten rid of most of the people who would've been experienced enough to know how to investigate him.

Nice discussion of impeachable offenses [here](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/1999/02/what_are_high_crimes_and_misdemeanors.html).

In any event, I appreciate your opinion and don't want to argue about it.  I understand you may disagree.  For the sake of the U.S., if you do, I hope you're right.  Would be interesting to see if we could revisit all of this in 3 years and see.  But like I say I wouldn't want to be right.

*But the US Congress is a tiger that we pretend is made of paper. It is, at this point, taken for granted that congressional Republicans will protect their co-partisan at any cost. It is, at this point, expected that they will confirm Trumps unqualified nominees, ignore his obvious conflicts of interest, overlook his dangerous comments, and rationalize his worst behavior.*

<TEXT> Thanks for your response! If it happens again I will try the battery calibration trick.

Unfortunately mine is an 8.9, which Amazon doesn't sell anymore.  So I'm kind of out of luck if the problem is the device.

I'm thinking maybe one or two of the apps which kept running in the background drained it.  (I'm suspicious about one in particular.)

Weird that it didn't happen with an earlier version of the OS.  But I updated to 5.+ because I wanted to run Google Play on it.

If this 8.9 continues to have the problem, though, I guess maybe once and for all I'll switch over to my Samsung Tab S2.  It's actually been pretty great. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We could, but the numbers of responses we'd get almost certainly wouldn't come close to even a significant fraction of the number of users.  It would be next to impossible to ascribe any meaning to the nonresponses (as valid arguments would exist on both sides as to what silence meant).  

So I don't see how we could read a vote as meaning much of anything, except as to what the people who voted thought.  And we're seeing that here (believe me the mods are paying attention to this thread).

Problem is we're in a semi-public forum.  The nature of these forums is that people should be allowed to participate, as long as they follow our rules.  So it's hard to justify not wanting to let others know that the sub exists on the sole ground that an increase in numbers may lead to junk posts.

Need to realize, too--I've been a mod of this sub since it had just a few hundred subbies.  And a number of those subbies are still around.  In my/their views, a lot of the content that we get now--and which we routinely remove--consists of exactly the kinds of junk posts that everyone's worried about.

So we *already* get that stuff, and the mods *already* are griefed for enforcing rules against it.  

There's no obviously good outcome for this situation.  So we're thinking we might as well look on the bright side, hopefully bring in some articulate users who have something worthwhile to contribute (because we have, after all, gotten a *lot* of users like that over the years as the sub has grown).  And we'll keep removing posts that violate our rules (along with subbies' help in identifying them).

As /u/superkerfuz says, if ultimately it seems like it's not worth the effort, we can change our minds. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We've been discussing it, yep.  As the sub has grown to this point, we have seen a significant change in the quality of posts--only some of it for the worse.  So we're pretty sure we'd continue to have to work against the relatively contentless posts.  

That said, it's not entirely clear that our subby count would go up that much.  The number of subs involved is pretty high--much higher, say, than the number of defaults, and much closer to the numbers represented in /r/all.  Also, the subs chosen seem to be based on some sort of rate of growth system; as this sub tends to grow after successful seasons, it's possible that others would surpass us and we'd get bumped off the list.

If our inclusion presents significant problems, we'll reconsider it.  But in light of the Cowboys' worldwide popularity and brand recognition, it doesn't seem right to decline.  

Also, it's all of the mods' opinions--and probably everyone in our sub's--that the Cowboys are missing great opportunities by continually choosing not to work with us.  One possibility is that as a result of increased exposure, the Cowboys finally will stop comparing us to Facebook and start trying to support us, the way so many other teams do their subs.

<TEXT> More info is available [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/5sghb1/introducing_popular).  One result is that we expect the sub to grow significantly over the next few months.  The Dallas Cowboys are one of the most recognized brands in the world.  (And are, of course, the greatest NFL team ever, with the best fanbase of all time.)

We love every one of you guys; you have made us what we are.  Still, as mods, we couldn't be more excited about the opportunity to meet new fans, to consider and discuss all the exciting new challenges the team faces.  We remain convinced that we have the most knowledgeable and devoted Cowboys fans on the net.  

We look forward to the change.  Let's all welcome our new subbies. </TEXT>

I finally gave up on the 3rd-generation device, got a 4th-generation one, and the various Google files installed just fine on the updated fireOS (version 5.whatever).

I guess too I could try resetting the device to factory default; that might work.

Or maybe I could find the 5.x version of the OS as a side load somewhere!  Might not be easy to find that though.

A real shame Amazon didn't support the 8.9 better/more.  A nice device.

<TEXT> Generally no.  Supreme Court Justices only have to recuse themselves from cases in which they have (or may be perceived to have) conflicts of interest.  But Gorsuch doesn't seem to have any conflict of interest in deciding whether Trump's immigration ban is Constitutional (compare to whether Gorsuch would be allowed to determine whether *his appointment* is Constitutional (or if he actually was on a Bench in a lower court considering the Constitutionality of the order)--then he'd have to recuse).

Think of it this way: if appointed Judges had to recuse themselves any time a case involved the office of the person who appointed him/her, there'd be no court capable of determining any suit against a governor in the many states in which the highest courts' judges are appointed.

[Here's an article](http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2016/05/when-do-supreme-court-justices-recuse-themselves-from-cases/) briefly discussing when SCOTUS Justices have to recuse.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Heck I would do that now with any older folks looking for fishing buddies.  And I wouldn't even want to catch a fish!  Older people are so awesome; they have so many amazing stories that otherwise get lost to time.

I had a 96 year old barber a few years ago.  Whenever I'd go to his shop he'd be dozing in his chair with the door locked.  He used to say he had more customers in Heaven than he did on earth.  I think really by then I was his only customer.  He finally passed a few years ago, at the amazing age of 103.

I miss him.  But my first thought upon hearing of his death was this: *his customers have been waiting for him.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Terrific insight.  Thank you.  I try to maintain a neutral stance, typically, as my view is the real political divide isn't between the left and right, but the top and bottom.  I'm no fan of Clinton or the GOP to tell the truth.  And I definitely understand the frustrations of the forgotten classes.

But this guy Trump seems either like a lunatic or corrupt beyond belief, if the allegations about his business interests in the affected nations are correct.  

In either event, I've yet to see anything remotely suggesting that he's qualified or of serious enough mind to be President.

I keep thinking it's a matter of time before the GOP finally respects our nation enough to impeach the guy.  Seems obvious they're so giddy about enacting their agenda they're willing to work with him as long as possible, no matter what harm he does.  And maybe they fear his base.

But at some point they need to remember the significance of their offices and the oaths they've made.  They need to act in the interest of the United States and get this nut out of office. </TEXT>

It's so bad that another account involved in it has messaged me to mock us about it.  From what we can tell, all the admins did was check ips.

<TEXT> Yes, but you're the creator.  If your account was hacked, you'd want the legitimate mods to act.  Particularly if the admins didn't help you.

Plus, any fear in that regard would incentivise you to consider who you'd invite to be a mod.  Hard to see how that would hurt a sub.

Maybe a safeguard could be built in--verified account plus a code emailed to the original email address at creation could solve identity verification challenges. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you! But unfortunately that address does not lead to permissions.  Account tab takes me to a page with 6 additional options--of which "manage my account" seems the appropriate option.  That takes me to https://account.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com/liquid/home/index!display.action, which, after sign-in, has an additional "account" tab with (finally!) a sub account tab.  But that sub account tab does not have permissions, either.  Instead it offers parental controls: Sign-In ID (E-mail Address) , Chat/Message Block, Content Restriction On, User-Generated Media Block,  Monthly Spending Limit.

Each sub account has its own email address.  I reset the Vita to clear my master account, reformatted the memory card to clear it, and entered one of the email addresses for a sub account.  Then, when I went to buy the game, it wouldn't let me.  [Here's a link where I describe that problem](https://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/5qf1s4/how_do_i_buy_a_game_for_a_sub_account_to_play_on).

As an aside, I have 2 copies of the game in my master account (was accident, and apparently I can't return them).  But based on what another user told me, it sounds like the sub accounts can't access those copies?  If that is supposed to be possible, I'd be content for the moment just allowing them to play those.  But I can't figure out how to do that either. </TEXT>

Also, what does adhoc mean in respect to vitas?

And would I need to get 2 copies of the game or just one?

Sorry about all the questions.  I'm just trying to figure this out.

Also, I'm kind of worried about registering both vitas to my master account; my children are *young*, so I'm being a parent.  But if that's the only way to get the game onto them I'll do it.

Just...there *must* be a way to get games onto vitas registered to sub accounts; it's just that no one seems to know how.

<TEXT> Thank you for all this info!

They are young children.  So I kind of appreciate the control.  I could imagine that by the time they reach any appreciable distance into the teen years they would prefer master accounts, but technology changes so quickly that by then I'm guessing changing accounts won't be such an issue.  

Master accounts don't allow for the kinds of protections small kids need right?

Next, thanks for clarifying how wallets are supposed to work.  Problem is, even though I've put money into their wallets from the master account, I can't buy the game via the sub account, as I get the indicated message.  

Do you have any suggestions how I might be able to do that?  Or what I might be doing wrong that's preventing me from it? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I want to buy a game for my 2 children to use via their sub accounts on their separate ps vitas.  I am trying to set up the first vita for this, and I am mystified at how to do it.

I restore the vita to factory settings, then on the first login use the sub account info.  Then I get a screen saying: *To use Playstation Network with this account, you must provide additional information.  Complete the initial setup and then link your account with the Playstation Vita system*.  

I have no idea how to do this.  It seems as though, when I've tried (no clue if I was doing the right thing), I keep making it so that the Vita only will recognize my master account, not the sub account.

When I haven't tried, though, when I go to buy a game, I am told that I can't access the Playstation network, and I can't log in using the sub account info--even though at setup I was able to sign in using the sub account info!

I haven't been able to find anywhere online how to solve this.

I am very confused.  I really would appreciate someone explaining what the heck I need to do, so my kids can play this game together.

Thank you in advance!

<TEXT> Cowboys do this kind of limited edition a lot, as can be seen on [ebay](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40 _trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.Xdallas+cowboys+limited+edition+football.TRS0 _nkw=dallas+cowboys+limited+edition+football _sacat=0).

Speaking from a production perspective, 20k isn't exactly a limited edition, except in the sense that *everything* is produced in a limited number.  Calling it "limited" is purely a marketing ploy to drive up interest.

Which apparently hasn't exactly worked, as the ball's for sale for [42 bucks](http://www.ebay.com/itm/DALLAS-COWBOYS-Champions-Ball-Football-NFL-Limited-Edition-HOLDS-AIR-/252703394777?hash=item3ad64bcbd9:g:xwsAAOSwubRXFpXr).  With the added benefit that it "HOLDS AIR".

This problem does not occur in Chrome, so it seems that the difference must lie in how Firefox handles css.

He's got a ways to go before he catches [Lawrence Taylor](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/T/TaylLa00.htm).  Taylor's the only guy on defense I've ever seen who reminded me of Jim Brown--a man among children.  But Watt's certainly headed in the same direction. </TEXT>

Biggest problem we all have is that none of us can read the future.  All we have is the past.  And we've all seen how excellent Romo has been, and how often his teams have let him down.  It's hard not to want a guy like that to succeed.  No easy answer to this situation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get what you're saying.  It was such a magical year none of us wanted it to stop.  And there's no guarantee it'll happen again.

But comfort yourself.  Game wasn't stolen from them like in 2014.  They left it all on the field.  Offense and defense played their guts out, like they had all year.  Not the defense's fault it lacked playmakers.  

But comfort yourself.  Next year the Cowboys still will have all their great talent on offense.  If Dak could learn/do this in one year, imagine what he'll be able to learn after an off-season of study.

Also next year hopefully Tapper and Smith can play.  Maybe Lawrence finally will show something.  Sure, the Cowboys will be drafting low, but they got some great talent all across the draft this year.  So they finally may be able to add some guys who'll take them over the hump.

<TEXT> This is what it was like in the 60s.  Landry kept getting the Cowboys to the verge and couldn't get past it.  For 11 years he kept trying, kept hearing that the Cowboys *couldn't win the big one*.  Imagine how fans felt after Super Bowl V.  Totally outplayed the Colts and made enough mistakes to choke a goat.

The Cowboys adjusted at halftime today but spotting the Packers an 18-point lead was tough.  Like that game in the 90s when the Cowboys gave the 49ers a 3-TD lead.

With luck, this is just the start.  Cowboys draft defense next year, and they'll be even better.  Just like when they lost their first playoff game under Johnson. </TEXT>

<TEXT> STDs I could see it, sure.  But that's not even a subtext.

Instead, like you suggest, seems like something else is going on in it.  I went away from this movie after the first time thinking of--not STDs chasing them; but that it was death, and they only became aware of it upon sexual awakening.  I don't mean puberty, or even the act, but the change that happens to the mind when sex approaches for the first time.

I saw this movie really about memory, the passage of time, regret, and the relentlessness with which our own mortality approaches.

Swimming pool scene was pretty bad, and this movie wasn't perfect, by any means.  But almost none are.  Heck, there are people who criticize The Exorcist.

What I liked about this: its originality.  And also the sense of timelessness.  Like...exactly when did this story happen?  Had a very Donnie Darko-ish kind of dream-time to me.

Weird things going on in it, nothing to do with the monster.  The mom, drinking.  The phones on the walls.  The e-reader, unlike anything we've ever seen before.  Yet the kids are watching Killers From Space on a cathode TV.  And the girl using that e-reader to read The Idiot--hardly mass market paperback fare.  

Anyway. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Welcome!  One thing's for certain: the Cowboys never will move.

And here's something else: yeah, sure, Jerry generally is an annoying owner.  But ever since he hired Garrett he's stepped back from football operations and he's letting competent people run them, who seem to have values that almost all of us can respect.  So if you'd like to root for guys you might actually admire in RL this may be the team.

Though Jerry still does say goofy stuff.  And he likes to take credit for *everything*.  But if that doesn't bother Garrett it won't bother me.

Also, I became a fan amidst the Staubach/Morton controversy, and I clearly remember when they drafted Dorsett.  So I remember the feeling back then.  This team is pretty exciting.  A lot like those teams.

It's a good time to come back. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reminds me a lot of the first time the Cowboys played the Packers.  At the time the Packers' defense was supposed to be so good.  I told a Packers fan who came to the sub that the Packers' defense was not going to win the game.  He laughed.

The Packers' offense will not win this game.  Whether the Cowboys win will depend on whether the Cowboys' offense can perform.  If it does, the Cowboys go to the championship. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem is that one's belief as to what the law is has nothing to do with what the law actually is.  Similarly, one's belief as to the nature of national security doesn't mean one is authorized to define national security.  Get what I'm saying?

As for recording others, each state has its own laws on what can be recorded and what can't.  [Here's a place](https://www.rcfp.org/reporters-recording-guide/state-state-guide) to check that.

If you're talking about recording a communication that is protected by federal secrecy laws--perhaps for disclosure, you're into the area of whistleblower laws.  [Here's some info](http://www.whistleblowers.org/resources/faq-page/know-your-rights-faq) about those. 

In short, it's dangerous.  Whether you're vindicated often may depend on whether you're prosecuted and in which court.  And if you're not you'll be subject to punishment--typically incarceration. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah I'm with you.  It looked to me like he ducked his head and intentionally led with the crown of the helmet.  Of course only he knows what he *intended*.  But my guess is the NFL will fine him for it.  Not that that proves intent.

Certainly it wasn't a situation where Hall had no choice but to hit that way. 

In any event, it's a shame, because Nelson's important to the Packers, and it's no good when anyone's hurt that way.

So I'm not worried about the winning streak.

I *am* concerned that Rodgers is looking like his old self--because early in the year he was misfiring.  However, if Montgomery and Nelson are out, that will help.

Still, it'll be the Cowboys offense that decides the game.  One way or the other. </TEXT>

It also talked about how monied interests came in and started limiting regular persons' access to it by lobbying government to pass strict licensing rules, raising fees, and so on.

I haven't seen anything in the intervening years suggesting that the article was anything other than prescient and straight-on accurate.

<TEXT> I'm trying to play The Last of Us in PS Now for pc, and for the first time I've connected a DS 4 controller to my pc.  I've downloaded DS4Windows and set rumbleboost to 0, but it doesn't seem that DS4Windows is necessary to use a DS4 controller, and that setting doesn't seem to be having an effect in the game, as I'm still getting rumble.

Maybe there's an order in which I'm supposed to activate DS4Windows and plug in the controller or something?

I'd appreciate any feedback on how to turn it off.

Edit: I've just figured this out!  And I'm going to leave this post up as evidence of my ignorance in the unlikely chance that anyone else gets so easily stumped.

The solution is to press the PS button in the game screen, and there's an obvious selection for it called (wait for it): Vibration Settings!

So if anyone else misses the obvious there you go. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Problem is that the NFL allegedly isn't abiding by the CBA--at least, according to the article: 

*"Although the 2015 Policy on Performance Enhancing Substances ("2015 Policy") required a minimum of three arbitrators -- there were only two," Zashin wrote. "In addition, the 2015 Policy required that any arbitrator assigned to hear appeals was not otherwise affiliated with the NFL and NFLPA.  That requirement was not followed.*

*"The 2015 Policy entitles a player to information upon which he can contest discipline.  Lane was denied even the most basic information, including information about his treatment under the 2015 Policy."*

Of course these are just allegations in a complaint.  But I must admit I haven't seen much suggesting that the NFL knows how to professionalize its disciplinary proceedings. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That was a good book.  Nice recommendation.

Thing about Jerry, though, is that he just says stuff; whether it has anything to do with reality is beside the point.  How, for instance, exactly is Jerry going to keep this case "active" when the NFL already has announced the punishment?

Gregory appealed; the appeal was denied.  Exactly what can be done short of a lawsuit?

So just like with all his pronouncements about personnel issues, unfortunately too I have to take this one with a grain of salt. </TEXT>

As an aside, the above numbers don't actually *show* that the NFL is more strict on domestic violence, but it's a limited sample and may be missing a lot of background info.

And Gregory, well, I've said it before.  I understand having a hard life and facing emotional/psychological issues and needing help.  But at some point you're responsible for who you are.  And until the law/rules change, you have to realize what you're risking when you even approach violating them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Absolutely concur!  This season was incredible.  Magical in so many ways.  It reminded me of what it was like to love the team when I was a kid.

Regardless of the Cowboys' past, and whatever I might think of Jerry Jones, it has been a long time since the Cowboys were relevant in the NFL.  

But over time Garrett has been transforming the team into something I actually could appreciate, which doesn't create intellectual dissonance when I root for it: he's created a team that doesn't quit, that's starting to accrue dynamic players who love to hustle, who actually seem to enjoy being good people.

<TEXT> To tell the truth, do any all-star games matter anymore?  In the old days, I understand, it was the one chance fans had to see all the best players.  But now, with the net, we're inundated with histories, lives, interests.  We don't need to see them all together because we see them all the time.

MLB's tried to fix it with the homefield advantage gimmick.  But that's not particularly fair, and I doubt many fans--or players for that matter--care who wins because of its effect on some future event.

For the players--well, who pays for the trip to Hawaii?  The NFL?  That at least might be a perk for them.  And after a long season it's understandable, with how sore and banged up their bodies must be, that they don't want to play particularly hard.  But that just makes the game for fans even less relevant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> After you said this, JC, I actually looked at the figures above.  Granted it's a limited sample, as it's only based on the past few months.  And I am no apologist for Gregory, as I've said elsewhere that at some point he has to take responsibility for his life.  But of the names with multiple punishment on this list, the punishments look like this:

Mike Pennel was banned 4 games, then 4 games  
Rolando McClain was banned 10 games, then 16 games  
Armonty Bryant was banned 4 games, then 3 games      
Karlos Williams was banned 4 games, then 10 games      
Sammie Lee Hill was banned 4 games, then indefinitely   
Seantrel Henderson was banned 4 games, then 10 games    
Gregory was banned 4 games, then 10 games, then indefinitely    

Maybe there are other circumstances, and I am no expert on the CBA.  But that is not consistent punishment, which is one of the first factors courts consider when it comes to issues like *arbitrary and capricious*.  

Also, I think a point of the post was the ridiculous disparity between the NFL's punishments involving violent crimes and what some would say are victimless crimes.

Without apologizing for Gregory, pretty sure we both would agree *that's* messed up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Judicial system won't do squat; this punishment was imposed pursuant to the CBA, and courts almost never rewrite bargaining agreements.  

That said, he might be able to argue that the punishment was arbitrary and capricious, but generally to succeed at that he'd have to show that the punishment was out of line with punishments imposed for similar offenses (and inconsistent with the provisions of the CBA).  Not sure whether he'd be able to do that.  Offhand I don't remember that the NFL has imposed that many 1-year suspensions. 

There is at least a chance though that he'd succeed in a lawsuit; from outside the NFL's disciplinary structure seems so ad hoc as to be laughable if it weren't so imbalanced and unfair. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For what it's worth, Danny White held numerous Cowboys' QB records when he retired.  At the time it was pretty generally acknowledged that if he'd managed to break through to one Super Bowl championship (for instance, during those 3 straight years in which the Cowboys appeared in the NFC championship game), he'd be in the Hall of Fame.

White was a terrific QB.  Just didn't quite get there.

<TEXT> Hi.  Thanks for trying to be friendly, but as I explain elsewhere in this thread, we can't allow copies of the text because we did actually receive an official complaint about it.  The last thing we need is to have to deal with the DMCA.

So it was nice of you to do, but we had to remove it.  

Other subs may allow copy/pastes--and we actually did too until we received the complaint.  But since we're the ones who received the complaint we're the ones who have to comply.

Maybe our mobile users could contact the devs of the mobile app to see if there's a way to allow for incognito mode through it. </TEXT>

Wondering if maybe we should add a note in the sidebar about this.  

But the main reason we don't allow reprints of the articles for mobile users is because in the past we actually received a complaint from the Dallas Morning News, and last thing we need is to deal with a DMCA issue or inquiries from the admins.  So I worry that explaining how to circumvent the soft paywall "officially" could present us with the same problem. </TEXT>

As I've said repeatedly, this is not a L/R thing at all.  It is an us/them thing, where *them* represents the powered interests.  You're right, though.  If the Dems had managed to create this type of machine, we'd be facing the same issue: the imperilment of our political system. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Problem is that if everyone adopts the why bother approach, we'll morph into a one-party system.  And in the absence of choice, even if it is as weak a choice as the Dems sometimes present, we're no longer a republic.  In other words, there is a valid argument that a republic needs political competition simply to survive.  So the people who *bother* do it because they love the idea of what the U.S.'s political system represents.  As should we all, because, left or right, we all are Americans.  And we need a competitive electoral cycle or we all lose. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not so sure the issue is as much about the Dems' platform as it is about the GOP's abilities to: (1) gerrymander state and federal legislative districts to take control of governorships, state legislatures, and Congress; (2) develop a consistent think-tank system and propaganda machine to spread its message, based generally on sloganeering at the expense of people's true interests; (3) display solidarity of principle and conduct in response to perceived pressures; and (4) attack long-held structural beliefs about how the system should operate.

Years ago the GOP rethought its entire process after Goldwater and morphed its goals toward a long-term strategy.  Unquestionably it's run circles around the Dems since at least 1980, as over time it's taken control at the grassroots level.

It does not seem to have any interest in limiting its advances, even if they do ultimately seem bad for the U.S.  And why should it?  It's furthering its own goals while advancing its platform, and as there's no consistent message from the other side, there's nothing to stop it from shouting down moderates within its own party.

But these are all procedural issues and have nothing to do with the actual underlying value of message.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was a different age, for sure.  Today's NFL is much more suited for inflated stats; comparing the 2 eras is misleading.  

The difference between Romo and Aikman might be like the difference between Rodgers and Peyton Manning.  Aikman was 100% blue chip.  Romo's a junkyard dog.  

Legend has it that after Landry first saw Aikman in a scouting practice, he canceled all other scouting appointments.  Jimmy Johnson said that if the Hurricanes had Aikman, they would've gone 24-0, winning every game by 50 points.

Here's Aikman's [scouting report](https://twitter.com/RickGosselinDMN/status/767384043071508480/photo/1).  1s or 1.5s in every category.

There is no question--none--that any GM comparing the 2 would've wanted Aikman.

<TEXT> In fact, before the winning began, circa 1964, the clamor got so loud for Murchison to fire Landry that Murchison solved the problem the only way he could: he gave Landry a [10 year contract](http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2015/12/29/moment-40-landry-10-year-extension-29-years-as-head-coach/).  That made it clear to fans and the media that Landry was there to stay.

Of course, [Jerry did the same for Johnson](http://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-07/sports/sp-1196_1_10-year-contract), but the ego clash was so bad neither could stick with it.

This is the thing about Garrett: he doesn't care who gets the credit.  I.e., he's the only one who could put up with Jerry.  So for better or worse Garrett's the best chance for the Cowboys to become relevant again in ~~our~~ Jerry's lifetime. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's funny; you watch the NFL long enough and you can see why some teams don't succeed.  Their expectations are unrealistic and they're impatient.

The Cowboys from the 60s-80s, the Patriots (yuck) over the past 15 years, the Giants and Steelers, hopefully the Cowboys now going forward--they hire people and give them time to do their jobs.  

We used to have this discussion a lot back when Garrett was new.  Consistency of management seems to be really important when it comes to sustained success.

Caution, sure, but.

Maybe they played him because they wanted to see if he still could?  And upon seeing how sharp he was, they didn't want to risk him?  

But like the article says, the question about Tony has nothing to do with his skills.

Only sure answer: we saw that Sanchez can't.  I mean, he looked *awful.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have no dog in this fight, and I only want the Cowboys to win.  I see both sides of the issue, for sure.

That said, Tony did look really good.  Problems though are 3: durability, the amount of time Tony lost to injuries, and that Dak took control of the team.  (Maybe that's 2?  I couldn't decide.) These are not insurmountable problems, but they are significant enough that we have to acknowledge, if we're going to be reasonable, that is, that the Cowboys did not resolve this irrationally.

Arguments that Tony gives them the best chance to win are not particularly persuasive, as Dak led them, in his first year, to as good a record as Tony ever did.  Arguments that Tony gives them the best chance to win in the playoffs aren't, either, as his playoffs record hasn't been so great.  Further, both of the arguments are speculative and unprovable.

It's true that Tony has some skills that Dak doesn't, and of course lots of experience.  But Dak also has some skills that Tony doesn't, including a surprising ability not to risk the ball.  As turnovers famously correlate with losses, this should not be overlooked.  

The experience issue is offset to a significant extent by the fact that Tony's skills are not the question.  The past 2 games he's played, stretching back over 2 years, he's sustained serious injuries.  The question is durability.  Tony's not 28 anymore.  Heck he's not even 34.  His body has shown that it no longer can take the pounding.  And there's no answer to that, as time makes a mockery of us all.

Sure, the past is not evidence of the future, but in every line of work it is persuasive.  And while any given team can handle disruption caused by switching QBs, that doesn't mean the team would go looking for it.

So I dunno.

Another thing I guess I should add is that most of the great QBs' careers have ended because of injury--concussions and the body breaking down.  For example, Staubach and Aikman, when they retired, both still could play, and their skills hadn't eroded particularly.  Their bodies, though, had begun to go.  This is what I'm seeing more than anything in Tony.

Finally, we shouldn't overlook Tony's relationship wih Garrett and Jerry.  Clearly they're friends, so there's something going on in those dynamics to which none of us are privy.  But we shouldn't overlook whatever that is.  Whatever it is.  But friends wouldn't respond the way these 3 have unless some sort of recognition, a shared value, understanding, or something, was there.  We just don't know what.

<TEXT>  First off this would just apply to broadcast channels 

This doesn't mean we don't need a return of the Fairness Doctrine.  We do--it's just not all we need.  But  I remember when it was revoked--Murdoch pushed for it so he could bring FOX to the U.S.  We see the result now: confirmation bias throughout the media and a divided populace.

We won't get any new laws which protect print media or whistleblowers, though, until somehow we can break the stranglehold money has on politics.  I think maybe money's always had a huge influence; it's just that now the civic limitations on power have been weakened to the point that there are no more checks to it.

I hate to think I'm as pessimistic as you suggest elsewhere, but absolutely it's true that the U.S. is not immune to historical forces, and a people who don't fight for freedoms lose them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Criticism of Mr. Obamas stance on press freedom, government transparency and secrecy is hotly disputed by the White House, but many journalism groups say the record is clear.

What's really amazing to me is that Obama came into office claiming that he'd run the most transparent Presidency in history and promising protections for whistleblowers.  Instead he gave us the opposite.

<TEXT> Gosh you're right!  Nations don't impose different laws on multinationals!  And multinationals such as Dennys, IHOP, Olive Garden, and many of the dozens of multinationals identified [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_restaurant_chains) have no interest in lobbying national governments regarding the many different nations' wage laws.  And any pushback has nothing to do with the various sociopolitical forces inherent in those nations.

And expectations about tips don't [vary from nation to nation](http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2008-11-11/etiquette-101-tipping-guide) based on those forces.  Conde Nast!  Wow!  It must be a nutcase too!

How foolish I must be.

Sarcasm off, no one legitimately could argue that wage concerns don't lie at the heart of capitalism or that the U.S., for better or worse, is the world's leader in capitalism.  So *of course* business interests, including those of multinationals, affect wages, including those of servers.

And businesses own the media.  That's simply ipso facto.  And owners *control*.  So I don't see whatever issue you think you have with what I said.  Business interests have defined the U.S. since at least the industrial age--and that's not necessarily the case in nations such as Canada or France, both of which have much more liberal histories. </TEXT>

But you remind me: when I was a kid, circa 1973, the Cowboys lost some game, I don't remember which, and a teacher came to class on the Monday and said he'd sent a telegram to Landry at halftime, saying that he should be fired.

Of course the Cowboys were only halfway through their run of 20+ consecutive winning seasons, went on to lose 2 classic Super Bowls, to win another, and to appear in the NFC championship game in the 80s 3 years in a row, and Landry is considered one of the greatest coaches of all time.  But to my teacher that day he wasn't even *passable at best*. </TEXT>

In Garrett he's got a guy who couldn't care less about the credit.  He just wants to win.

Whether he's the greatest coach ever is sort of beside the point (though he reminds me of Landry in quite a few ways).  The real issue is that he's the only coach Jones ever has hired who can get along with him.

<TEXT> I haven't been able to figure out this either/or thing yet.  People saying Romo can't do this, Dak can't do that.  We've seen what Romo's been able to do his entire career.  However, like it or not, he's 36, near the tail end of his career, and hasn't played a full season in almost 2 years.  Additionally, demonstrably his body is beginning to wear out, and he hasn't been as mobile as Dak in probably 10 years.

In contrast, Dak clearly still has limitations; he lacks the ball control, consistent form, and pocket awareness of Romo.  But his reads are splendid, he doesn't risk the ball, and the game doesn't seem too fast for him.

It doesn't weaken Romo's legacy to say that it's unrealistic to expect him ever to rise to the heights of his younger days any more than it does Dak's potential to say he still needs coaching.

Additionally, as I mention elsewhere, almost half the 2016 team didn't play with Romo as a consistent starter.  To them he is a locker room presence, but it is clear that this team long since has bought into what Dak brings.  And there is no question that he is an excellent student who has risen to the occasion.

Instead of arguing one or the other, we should be glorying in the facts that we got to root for such a splendid playmaker in Romo and that the future looks bright with Dak. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  the starters on offense were nearly identical.

Again, no they're not. Hanna (who was the 2d starting TE in 2014) hasn't played all year, so Swaim (who's started the most at 2d TE), Prescott, and Elliott all are new starters. That's a 28% change. I.e., more than 1/4 of the starting offensive unit is different from 2014.

To illustrate the extent of the change, no one offered a 28% cut in pay would suggest that the amounts would be "nearly identical".

Not to mention that almost every one of the starters (9 out of 11) in 2014 started 15+ games, whereas this year significant absences/changes include Collins, Butler, that Dez missed 3 games, and that Beasley has had a profoundly increased role.  Only 7 out of 11 have started 14+--an 18% drop.

I'm not saying these things to argue with you, but simply to help us understand the extent to which the team has changed.  It's a different group on both sides of the ball.

Only 31 players remain from the 2014 team.  That's a change of almost 42%.

Of the significant contributors this year, Anthony Brown, Maliek Collins, Elliott, David Irving, Byron Jones, and Prescott all are new.

This is a substantially different team from the 2014 group.

<TEXT> Absolutely there's no reason to denigrate one player simply to support another.

Romo's been spectacular his entire career.  He's made every team better.  Hasn't been his fault so many of the teams sucked.  

That said, Dak's been pretty impressive too.  Says something that the only other rookie ever to take his team to 13 wins was Roethlisberger.  That's heady company.

Cowboys still may need Romo before the season's done.

<TEXT> Mods of /r/cowboys changed our policy this year, after it became clear that a lot of NFL teams' mods had begun working together to cut down on trolls under certain conditions.  Essentially when a mod from another team's sub notifies us of any problem accounts, we review the accounts and respond as seems appropriate.  Definitely we've banned accounts since our change.

I won't apologize for that guy because we had nothing to do with it.  But please don't think he's representative of our sub as a whole.  We welcome civil discussion and fans of all teams and work hard (to much criticism from trolls within our sub) to keep it that way. </TEXT>

You reported *one* troll to us, not "a few".

In any event, we didn't do anything because our policy is only to police users in other subs when we receive reports from those subs' mods.  As far as I understand, this is the policy of *every* NFL sub's mods.  If it's not, it's certainly not unreasonable, especially in this case, as that particular user doesn't have much of a history in /r/cowboys, and seems to have been set up as a troll account anyway.

We specifically asked you, more than once, to report any particular user to the mods of this sub, for example, /u/spazsquatch, /u/icebreak, or /u/xylan_treesong, and told you that if the mods of this sub saw a problem they'd let us know.  *They* are the ones responsible for policing this sub, with users' help, and they are *excellent* mods.

Instead of doing that, you vented on us.

Next time, maybe you should try simply being reasonable.  Might get better results.

Sorry for the loss.  Hopefully the Lions will have better luck against the Packers.

Miracle Mile was in many ways a bookend to a period which began with [Testament](http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/testament-1983), a period of social upheaval in which Reagan surprisingly reneged on a Conservative ideal at the time that the more nukes we had the better; during that period the U.S. reduced its nuclear arsenal pursuant to [START II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/START_II), and Jonathan Schell wrote his seminal work [The Fate of the Earth](http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=418).

Along with the above line, I'll never forget the heading of one of Schell's sections: *A Republic of Insects and Grass*.

This was before the U.S. descended into such partisanship; at the time it still seemed that we the people could control the country together.  We certainly had an effect on nuclear arms.

Romo's had a great career; he's added a lot to his teams.  Not particularly his fault they didn't break through.  But he's hardly the only great QB never to win a championship.  Marino, Tarkenton, Gabriel, and White all come to mind.

As fans, we have to appreciate what we're seeing.  And recognize that the bittersweet is a big part of sports. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are so many variables and so many different movies made, with such a wide variety of budgets, and the numbers are so obfuscated....[Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0611/why-movies-cost-so-much-to-make.aspx) offers as good a guess as any.  (Remember, too, that article only seems to address big-budget movies.)

But I wouldn't rely on its numbers either.  Thing is, there's so much money at stake, so few effective rules regarding its accounting, and such a strong advantage to the deep pockets not to tighten the rules, that we may never know. 

One thing to realize, though, is that a 2-hour movie requires hundreds of hours of planning, coordination, and production, all of which costs money. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A film budget is simply a line item shown to potential investors and rarely reflects the actual cost of making a film, as it omits many types of credits, incentives, and charges which may come into play.  It can be adjusted as need requires to solicit funding and/or limit tax exposure.  Its significance has nothing to do with what a typical person might consider to be a budget.

It is not to be confused with a net budget, which more closely (but not necessarily accurately) reflects how much a movie costs to make.  Net budgets generally are closely guarded secrets.

A good way to think of a budget (or gross budget) is as a starting point, or estimate, for the cost of a movie.

*Fiction* is a good name for almost every number you'll ever see regarding a film, except for gross earnings.  And even that may be fudged.

If you think I'm making it sound like Hollywood numbers have nothing to do with reality, you're right!  They don't.  This is simply one aspect of the simply astonishing world of moviemaking--and it's why studios resist so stridently any effort to disclose their accounting methods.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry, but in Hollywood almost every film fictitiously results in ["net losses"](https://www.google.com/search?q=hollywood+most+films+lose+money+accounting ie=utf-8 oe=utf-8).

They utilize accounting tricks called [Hollywood accounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_accounting) to mask their profits.

It's why, for example, Return of the Jedi, which has earned over $570M, despite a budget of $32.5M, famously (on paper anyway) [has never earned a profit](http://www.slashfilm.com/lucasfilm-tells-darth-vader-that-return-of-the-jedi-hasnt-made-a-profit/).

It's why any agent knowledgeable seeks [percentages of gross, not net](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20121018/01054720744/hollywood-accounting-how-19-million-movie-makes-150-million-still-isnt-profitable.shtml).  

And it's why net is meaningless when it comes to discussions about the profitability of a film.

<TEXT> Respectfully, blockbusters may have skewed your view of what makes a film a financial success.  A movie doesn't have to earn top 10--or even top 700--results to be considered successful.  This movie was widely praised, viewed, and discussed when it came out (and somewhat regularly ever since), and is widely considered a sci-fi classic.  Hard to see any way in which it's been *overlooked*.

As an aside, I checked out the earnings of one of my favorite's, Jacob's ladder.  Earned [approximately 1/3 of Children of Men](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=jacobsladder.htm).  Never heard it described as overlooked. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've mentioned it elsewhere, such as [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/5k9fk8/in_praise_of_netflixs_the_oa/dbmy0jx/).  The problem is the shooter.  He comes from nowhere--and I don't mean as though from a portal--but narratively.  There's no foreshadowing or signals whatsoever.  He serves as a deus ex machina, which is, frankly, an amateurish way to resolve a dilemma--like a character waking up to realize she'd dreamed the whole thing.

Additionally, of course, the way the shooter is presented (and defeated) is incredibly insensitive to the real-world horror that such a situation unfortunately all too often presents.

But disregarding the insensitivity, a story has to earn its ending.  And this one didn't--not at all.  Because it didn't, no matter how subtly, build up a rationale for the shooter.

Unlike some others, I don't have problems with some of the other characters--the psychologist, for instance.  But the final 10 minutes or so destroyed any suspension of disbelief I had at all.  

The show could've gotten to the same point--her being carried off, injured, the dance meaning something else, questions about her sanity--in many ways that could have been earned.  But it didn't. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thing is, any story has to earn its ending.  And this one, the ending was so disconnected from the story that it made the entire setup feel like a cheat.  

Seriously--a phantasmagorical story about a school shooting?  And the shooter comes *right out of nowhere*?  I don't mean nowhere as from a portal, but nowhere as from there were no elements in the setup whatsoever suggesting that this would happen.  Sure, sure, the future.  But a story has to earn its ending.  

There has to be some kind of development--foreshadowing, signals, *something*.  No matter how subtle.  Otherwise it's deus ex machina--which is about as discredited a mechanism as there is in writing.

Not to mention, of course, the absolute lack of understanding about the sensitivities associated with school shootings.  Good lord--could you imagine someone whose child actually was killed in a shooting seeing that?  They'd want to become shooters themselves--of the creators!  Point isn't that you can't write about ugly things, but if you're going to do it, make it organic to the story.

Want to see fiction that handles horror/ugliness brilliantly?  Try to find/watch [Testament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testament_(1983_film\)).  Tone was out of this world, and it took its setup to its logical conclusion.  No space aliens, angels, or dance routines in that.

Or [Another Earth](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/another-earth).  Or [Midnight Special](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/midnight-special).  Maybe that's the best comparison.  Crazy ending--*totally earned*.  Or [Take Shelter](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/take-shelter).  Or [The Quiet Earth](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/quiet_earth).  Or...or...or. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Surprisingly, pretty much every one of Netflix's superhero series are good.  Each with different tones but excellent acting/writing/production values.  Stranger Things, while not perfect, is entertaining (though Winona is extremely screechy).  Several others excellent too.  

But unless someone points to evidence suggesting that the majority of users here missed something about the end, this one is just *dumb*.  Which is really sad, because right up until that it had great tone and its writing, while a little inconsistent, was okay.

But the end is so bad it makes significant portions of the setup bad too.

The GOP seems intent on conquering every branch of state and federal government, regardless of its effects on the two-party system; it doesn't *want* a two-party system.

Over the past several decades the GOP has run circles around the Democrats strategically, who only belatedly seem to be recognizing that its goals have nothing to do with the countless inanities with which it divides the populace and everything to do with the destruction of the American political system as it's existed for the past 100 years. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can't have it both ways; marijuana's either addictive or it's not.  And if it's not, it's a choice.  

Many, many people have faced stress without resorting to marijuana use.  Also, I'm not saying marijuana use in itself is bad; to the contrary, I'd think it could be invaluable to NFL athletes, in particular, and that the NFL should be in the forefront of efforts to change the law regarding it.  

However, I will say that it's bad if it becomes self-destructive.  

Compare Gregory's situation to Dez in his early career.  Dez made some mistakes, and his early life was as bad as anybody's.  But he always showed up for his job.  Then, when he realized that he was facing the same situation--that the opportunity toward which he'd always worked was right before him, and profoundly at risk--he stopped the destructive behavior.  

So the question which Gregory has yet to answer is whether he can change.  Only time will show that.

But Broaddus's mention that Gregory has been showing up and working with Haley is encouraging; earlier reports had indicated that Haley had given up on him.  So it does seem that he may be trying.  Good for him.

Having said all of that, though, too, I still find it astonishingly short-sighted that the NFL punished Gregory for missing a drug test because he *was unavailable due to checking himself into rehab*.  That just seems asinine and counterproductive. </TEXT>

Squandered opportunity is one of the worst outcomes of a life.

That said, if he can pull his life together, well, who wouldn't root for that? </TEXT>

In the meantime, I'll stand by it--Martin, Smith, Frederick, all 1st-ballot Hall of Famers.  Not because they're Cowboys, but because they're sensational.

<TEXT> We'll disagree on that.  Ware, Martin, Smith, Frederick, are sure-fire first ballot Hall of Famers.  Only thing stopping Bailey from being a first-ballot Hall of Famer is that he's a kicker, but as he's the all-time leader in FG %, he's a lock.  I've been saying since before the Cowboys drafted Elliott that he will be.  Now that he's almost done with his first season, it seems even more clear--just like it was after Dickerson's first season.

But I've seen every Cowboys lineman since the very early 70s.  All the greats.  These are 3 of the best they've ever had.

That said, I'd rather the Cowboys put money into their defense.  It's been overlooked to the point of starvation, and yet still it performs relatively well.  Imagine if they actually started investing in it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Basically every game the Cowboys have been playing since the Steelers' game has been a playoff game, as their opponents have felt increased pressure; my guess is that some of the Cowboys' effort/struggles have been in the face of that.  They're simply not strong enough to steamroll teams desperate for wins.

Also, it's worth remembering that every single one of us would have been delighted with their record if we'd been asked at the start of the year.

Finally, though, I'd like to add that they need to give Irving more playing time, rotation or not, and see what happens. </TEXT>

Aikman was like a show-dog and Romo is like a battered mongrel with an ear missing, the other torn and bent, scars all over his face, and an absolutely indomitable desire to win.

<TEXT> Electors would *never* flip the election in the sense that they would vote for Clinton.  At most, they would select a different GOP candidate, and if Trump didn't have enough votes to win, the House would make the selection.  There is not much of a chance that the House would select anyone other than Trump, because of their own self-interested concerns that any such selection would enrage the GOP base which voted for Trump.

If the information is correct, Putin has committed an act of war against the U.S.  That the Soviets attempted the same kind of thing in prior decades doesn't make it any less offensive; it's just that back then the U.S. still had a strong-enough sense of civics that it could withstand the attempts.  

And there is almost no chance that the U.S. (i.e., Congress) will do nothing about it.  After all, if the GOP really cared about the health of the nation, it wouldn't have committed so many of partisan acts over the past 20 years.

I'm not suggesting the Democrats are much better; in the same way Putin has outplayed the U.S. politically, the GOP has outplayed the Dems.  Doesn't change the facts; but that's yet another of the great tragedies that has befallen the U.S. since the GOP regrouped after Goldwater.  They developed a plan, and they've worked it brilliantly--focusing on local elections, conquering states via gerrymandering, presenting young candidates, and pouring money into propaganda.  We're now experiencing the result.

Delegitimizing journalism, compromise, and civic unity is how one attacks democracy.  We're seeing it in full force now.  The U.S. is not immune to historical forces.  Honestly we seem to be facing a grave threat to our system of government, and anyone who would challenge the reality of that threat seems to me to be of questionable intent--and, online, of source. </TEXT>

We've had many examples on reddit alone of people who are believed simply because of bias confirmation or because they sound knowledgeable--not because they're actually right.  And often when a person tries to correct erroneous material, he's voted down/attacked.

The internet's greatest advantage is also its greatest threat: lies can be spread quickly, and those who don't have time to verify (i.e., almost everyone) can be misled far too easily. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry--but you're making a presumption there.  As far back as I can remember I've believed in God.  Whether that's based on faith or simply is a result of [bioelectrical impulses which can stimulate an awareness of the spiritual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_helmet) doesn't really matter to me, as I don't need every question answered.

My views are somewhat complex and out of the mainstream with respect to any religion--at least that I've discovered so far.  I think religion is used far too easily to mask biases, and I'm very cautious about organized religion as a whole.

If I could summarize my faith, it might be with some sort of amalgam of [Micah 6:8](http://biblehub.com/micah/6-8.htm) (*he has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?*), the devotion, which I've seen attributed to a lot of different people, *may my life be a prayer*, and the Buddha's statement, *To do no wrong, to do only good--this is the path to enlightenment*.

Unfortunately I haven't seen those things reflected in any religion--though they certainly were reflected in Jesus's life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And since when have these petitions ever accomplished anything?

For what it's worth, I read today that Lawrence Lessig is estimating that enough electors from TX are prepared to vote against Trump that the issue may have to be settled by the House.  But since Trump so far is recycling every kind of GOP crony, I doubt they'd have any reason to vote against him.  He seems perfectly prepared to serve as a lightning rod while the GOP enacts any agenda it wants. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unfortunately, I have to say that restraining orders (also called orders of protection) *do not work*.  Which is to say that they only work against reasonable people, and if a person is reasonable an order of protection is unnecessary.  The only thing an order of protection does is offer the police a reason to arrest someone after the fact.

But when a person who fears contact is up against a cult, that piece of paper won't be worth anything.  Anything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my view, God's will for the universe is the same as an artist's will for the drawing; nothing exists without it.  However, when we factor in free will, the equation changes, so that God's will is that humans can make choices on their own, and humans can't decide anything which will change the limits God places on the work.  In other words, God has factored in chance; and it is God's will that we will have choice.  

But within those limitations, we, not God, are responsible for what happens.  To suggest anything else eliminates free will.

It's kind of like flying a helicopter: if you try to adjust for every wiggle, you'll crash.  But if you let the helicopter bounce around within certain parameters, you'll get to where you're going.  That a helicopter bounces doesn't mean that the manufacturer intended it to bounce X degrees at Y moment, but that the manufacturer knew that bounce is how a helicopter works.  Same with God's control of the universe.

To suggest that any individual candidate wins because it's God's will is to suggest that people like Hitler, Kim Jong-un,  Bashar al-Assad, and so on (dating back to the beginning of human history), all came into power because God wanted them to.  Clearly there are significant moral problems with that.

When Paul wrote Romans 13, and Jesus said to render to Caesar that which is Caesar's, they both were suggesting that we focus on what matters--the spiritual--not that we accept wrongdoing as God's will. </TEXT>

<TEXT> People are blaming Dak for this loss, but I think Dez easily was as responsible for how lethargic the offense looked.  I think it was Sturm who said this offense needs Dez as a WR threat; otherwise teams crowd the line and the offense becomes one-dimensional (i.e., just like last year). 

Cowboys simply can't afford to have their best WR disappear in a big game--or, even worse, make big mistakes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't have any expectations as to how the Cowboys do in the playoffs. They definitely have some weaknesses.  But, respectfully, I'll disagree--I don't expect Dak to be the chief reason they might lose.  He's a rookie and still has a lot to learn.  But so far he's been a reason they win.  No indication yet he'll be a reason they lose.  

Even in his worst games, he's rallied the team to win.  There's just no indication whatsoever of the opposite.

A guy doesn't have to be brilliant to be a great QB.  He just has to *win*.

Dak made me finally understand why, in baseball, so many respected Derek Jeter.  The ability to perform under pressure is a gift.  And that kid's got it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thing is, Boot, anyone *could* win the Super Bowl, and we don't know who actually *can* until they do it.  Another perspective: Romo had a similar team in 2014 and he didn't win the Super Bowl.  Sure, the catch.  But there are always reasons why everything does/doesn't happen.  Teams win because of who they have and what happens during games.  

Like no less an authority than Dandy Don himself used to say, *If ifs and buts were candy and nuts, we'd all have a merry Christmas*.

The only inarguable fact is that the Cowboys have won 11 in a row, something no team in Cowboys history ever has done.  And they've done it with the guys who've played.  Which don't include Romo.

<TEXT> Listen, as many times as you may have done this, you still may have no idea just how important that simple ability actually was.  

I was very poor as a child, and orphaned.  When I was very young, my father, who loved Winnie the Pooh, and used to read it to me, died.  So of course I fell in love with Winnie the Pooh, read it constantly, loved the image.  But because we were so poor, I never actually got to see the various shorts which Disney had made based on it.  

My mother, knowing how much I loved it, used to promise me whenever I'd get down about the fact it was going to be on cable, that one day we'd get cable and I could see it.  But of course it never happened.  She died when I was a teen, and I was swept into a deep hole which, thankfully, only in retrospect I see existed.  And so my dreams/love of the character fell to practicalities--chiefly, the struggle to survive.

Finally, years later, I got to see those featurettes--Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree, Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day--and my reaction to them I barely can describe.  They reminded me so much of my father, and tangentially of all I'd lost.

Finally, even more years after that, long after I was grown and the immediacy of all that pain from childhood and loss had faded, I got to go to Disney.  

I was fine, having a good time, until I saw whoever was playing Winnie the Pooh.  I was a grown man.  I fell to my knees and wept.  So much about my father came back--his scent, the strength of his arms, the sense of belonging I felt in his grasp, the sound of his voice, his nickname for me, even the feel of his whiskers on my head and face, all flooded back to me.  And it had been *decades*.

Whoever was playing Winnie, sure, she or he probably was used to strong reactions.  But that day whoever it was gave me back something I'd lost, something which mattered to me more than I ever could say.  She gave me back my father.

<TEXT> John Niland was my favorite player as a kid. : )

I believe I'd pick Darryl Johnston over Don Perkins though--Johnston played FB like Witten plays TE.

Also, in my opinion Bob Hayes was the greatest WR the Cowboys ever had.  Remember: the zone was created to try to stop him.  That his numbers don't compare simply reflect the different era.

So I'd go with Hayes and Irvin at WR.

But this exercise reminds me of just how many great players the Cowboys have had over the years.  I mean, heck, even a lot of the 2d-stringers are Hall of Famers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know what to tell you.  Our hours are inconsistent.  This isn't a job; we don't clock in.  So occasionally posts languish and at other times they get removed quickly.  Depends on whether anyone's on.

As for this post and all similar posts, since before I became a mod it's been the policy of the sub to remove them.  The thinking goes that technically this kind of post is off-topic, and the vast majority of our users don't care about how the sub is operated, as long as it provides news and space for on-topic discussion, so we try to keep the feed clear of them.

In the earlier days of reddit, users knew to ask these kinds of things via mod mail.  Doesn't seem to be the case so much anymore.  Certainly not once a sub grows beyond a certain size.  

But so,  if anyone has a question/suggestion, we expect them to be submitted via mod mail.  I don't particularly mind this, though I get a lot of grief for it, even though it's not particularly my decision.  

I don't ever recall any kind of legitimate question being asked via mod mail which didn't generate a lot of consideration.  So mod mail isn't ignored, by any means.  

But it's asking too much to expect moderation policies to be set by users.  There's not a sub on reddit of any appreciable size or quality which is run that way.  It's just not practicable.
So when a user asks questions or has suggestions, he has to realize that they may not be answered in the way he'd prefer.  That doesn't mean he or the question/suggestion was ignored.  It just means that reasonable people can disagree.

A very small subset of users complain that we don't listen to our subbies.  But we do--*if* suggestions are simply made via mod mail.  Almost without exception the loudest complainers have never once contacted us that way.  Typically, once they have, they quit complaining.

In any event, it helps to maintain perspective.  Which some users seem to not like to do.  Or maybe it's that users don't realize how they come across.  Or maybe they don't know any way other than to be confrontational.  I dunno.

Anyway, we have a good moderation team; guys try hard to be fair and to satisfy every user.  Obviously that's not possible, so sometimes subsets of  users are disappointed.  That doesn't mean the mod team sucks.

Ah well.  Sorry for the digression.  To answer your question: we try to be consistent, but we're not always, and we have other demands on our time.  That's just reality.

<TEXT> I don't mean this in a bad way, but if you have an attorney you shouldn't be seeking legal advice from strangers on the internet.  You have an attorney for a specific reason: so s/he can give you legal advice.  Why you'd want advice from others when you're paying for a professional service is unclear.

Sure, maybe you'd want some sort of context for evaluating your attorney's advice, once s/he's available.  But again: you're on a web site.  The quality of advice you'd get here is even more questionable than what your attorney would provide.

Further, no attorney here could give you advice specific to your situation, in light of the fact that you already have an attorney.  And  getting advice from non-attorneys wouldn't be advisable.

You don't say there's any urgency to this issue.  So wait until Monday and talk to your attorney. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This isn't really a legal question.  The question is whether you want to do business with a company that presents itself this way.

Generally, you haven't suffered any damages.  So though you could sue the firm for anything you chose, the likelihood that the complaint would be dismissed probably would be high. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depends on your jurisdiction, what your job actually is, and a host of other variables.  You'll want to talk to a lawyer.

Generally, though, the fact that it was stolen doesn't necessarily preclude you from liability, as, for instance, it may have been stolen because you failed to secure it.

Also, depending on the circumstances of your employment, your employer could terminate you for this.

A lot of possibilities.  Thus: talk to a lawyer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a little late to the question, but I'm not sure there's a difference.  Oh, sure, maybe objectively there is, but for all we know our ideas of logic and rationality are limited.

One interesting thing to me about this, though,are the various studies I've read, such as the ones involving [the God helmet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_helmet), and the study about [transcranial magnetic stimulation](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/301117.php), which suggest that our beliefs in God can be modified by stimuli to the brain.

Ultimately, whether God exists is a question we may never be able to answer, until, if even then, upon death.  For all we know, maybe God's existence on a continuum, kind of like in string theory, such that God exists for people who thinks he does and doesn't exist for people who don't.  After all, love is like that.  And faith is real; but does that mean the object of faith is real?  And, again, at some point does it even matter?  As faith certainly has the power to make certain things real.

In any event, any answer relies on a great many assumptions, including, among others, how to define God, and we simply may not be equipped to make those intelligently.  

However, I'm not sure that means our minds are weak; is a mind weak because it has limitations?

Regardless of all that, I've reached the point where I'm okay with not having certain questions answered.  Life, I think, is kind of like flying a helicopter: if you try to control it too much you'll shake yourself to death.  Instead, you kind of have to be willing to accept a certain amount of chop.

For me, it's enough to act locally and to accept wisdom wherever I can find it.  That some of it happens to be from the Bible or from religious thinkers is just as fine with me as that some of it is drawn from great literature, great music, and a simple appreciation of the moment.  A need to define everything has faded as the years have passed.

<TEXT> Seriously.  Guys were catching Zeke from behind.  There's not another team in this league, at least that I've seen this year, which has a defense as fast as the Vikings.  Problem was their offense wasn't very good.

Combine the 2 teams--Cowboys' offense and Vikings' defense--and you have a powerhouse.

There's not another team in the league that could do what the Vikings did.

Also, of course, it was clear that the Cowboys were tired; they'd played 3 games in 11 days, and they were wiped.

So add to your blueprint as #3: catch the Cowboys when they're exhausted.  And maybe that'll work. </TEXT>

As I said, the current meme policy was created after a lot of effort and thought.  So we won't change it in the foreseeable future.  Accordingly, our choice either is to give the users who want to post them a place to do it or to remove them.

As mods, we long ago realized we can't please everyone.  If we allowed memes as top-level posts, we'd get a lot of complaints.  We know this because we did--we received *many* complaints.  And we get complaints when we create threads like this for specific memes.

So we try to balance the interests of some subbies with the interests of others.  *That* is our goal as mods, not, as you suggest, to let you discuss whatever you want. 

There are plenty of subs on reddit in which you can do that.

<TEXT> If/when the first is the most popular, we try to do that.  But that wasn't the first.  So you still would have been asking your question.

And it's a valid question.  But this generally always is our policy--and, again, it has nothing to do with not having fun.  It has to do with trying to be fair to everyone. 

As an aside, most mods with whom we've been in contact report that they face the same challenges in these types of situations.  Everyone says that no matter what they choose, they try to be consistent.  So that's what we do.  And we've *never* claimed not to make mistakes.  Moderation almost always means navigating a slippery slope.

As for our reputation, we do the best we can.  We're unpaid volunteers who have lives, families, jobs.  The sub has a wide variety of users, with a wide variety of experiences, expectations, and maturity levels, each of whom comes here for a different reason.  We try our best to meet everyone's expectations.  Unfortunately that means sometimes we'll make some users unhappy.  Our growth suggests that we're doing something right.  

But we always are willing to listen to suggestions--as long as they're not simply ad hominem attacks.  Helps, too, if they're made via mod mail, to ensure that we see them, and to help keep the sub on point.

<TEXT> Automoderator removed it due to the sheer number of reports it generated--all generally due to complaints of circlejerking and karmawhoring.

That led us to review the high number of similar posts, all rejoicing over the same thing.  While that one was the most popular, it was hard to justify removing all but one, particularly as that one was not the first.  So we left it removed, removed the others, and set up this thread.

While we understand fans are excited, not everyone wants to have their feeds overwhelmed with variations of *yay Cowboys are in the playoffs*.

One of our jobs as mods is to ensure that feeds maintain their variety.  And there are plenty of other places on reddit which cater to karma-mongoring.

If we'd removed the others and reinstated that one, we would've been subject to criticisms about favoritism.  So we had 3 competing interests--no way to win.  And then we *still* would have been faced with the problem of removing future threads while leaving that one up.  Accordingly, we took the steps that seemed most consistent with our goal of maintaining quality content and which seemed most fair to all users.  

Understandable you might disagree, but there was at least reasoning behind it--and it had nothing to do with not being excited.

As a friendly suggestion, next time you have a question like this, maybe better to message the mods to be sure we see it.

Cheers.

<TEXT> This story is from June 2016, as the article says at the beginning.  Unclear why the paper decided to run it again, as no updates were included.

In fact, [here's the update](http://archive.northjersey.com/news/education/boe-rules-on-students-gift-to-teacher-1.1676327), from October 2016: *The board ruled that the teacher could keep one of the tickets. But the students doing the fundraiser had to return the other one; Board President Betsy Ginsburg said that approach made the gift less extravagant.*

Board still isn't acting in line with its own policy. 

In any event, givers just need to ask the teacher who she'd invite and give the ticket to that person (who presumably isn't constrained by the policy). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dickerson was a terrific player--fast, big, strong.  He was the epitome of class, professionalism, and style.  

In terms of toughness, he was a little below Earl Campbell, who essentially was a mountain.  In terms of toughness, Campbell and Lawrence Taylor were men among boys.  But as Campbell can't walk now without help, over time I've come to believe that maybe it's good not to try to run people over all the time.  

In terms of speed and shiftiness, Dickerson was below Walter Payton and Barry Sanders.  But as a combination of those three, he couldn't have been much better.

Finally, as I recall he was an absolute blue chip coming out of college.  If he were to stay healthy, it was clear he was going to be a great one.  And he was. </TEXT>

That would be Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti ["Round and Round"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arrUQV8huUw).  Doesn't particularly remind me of the Eagles/California sound though--so maybe not.

Marriages get very complicated when children come along, no question.  Hang on as long as you can for your daughter.  

But realize: you are not a loser.  That you understand the importance of commitment is a strength, not a weakness.

You and your wife should consider marriage counseling.  Or maybe you should seek it on your own.  Seems like this is the perfect circumstance for it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep, yep, yep, and yep.  One of the many interesting things to me about being a Cowboys fan is seeing what guys do with the opportunities they're offered.  

No question that the NFL is a brutal game and that careers are short. Also no question though that the amount of money available can be astronomical--I mean, even a $1M contract is more than the average American will earn in 20 years.

So these guys have been working their entire lives to get to this point--but sometimes the baggage they bring with them is so heavy they can't finish the trip.  

Dez was able to do it; he stripped away all the mindset that was holding him back.  Sadly, like you say, Gregory can't.

It can become a celebration of the human spirit.   But also a mourning of the human condition. </TEXT>

If all goes well, surely the Cowboys will focus on the pass rush next year, right?  But in light of their record, not like they're going to have the best draft position.  

Still, as we've seen with Dak and maybe even Anthony Brown, where a guy is picked doesn't matter nearly as much as his willingness to learn and his motor. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes I would agree with this.  This is not just about the *tools* Dak has on offense.

This is about what Dak has brought to the offense--decision-making on par with the best QBs in the game, a calmness under pressure that seems to extend to his teammates, and a willingness to compete--all of which have gone with him apparently throughout his career.  Dak is contributing to the offense just as much as the OL, Zeke, Beasley, Witten, and Dez.  

He is the real deal.

Which isn't to say Wentz isn't.  But no one really can say how he'd be performing in this offense, because with him it would be a different offense. </TEXT>

But 3 years in, you know?  The equivalent of almost 2 full seasons.  And in that time he's averaging 4.8 sacks a season.  Pretty sure they expected more than that.

<TEXT> As much as I hate to say it, DeMarcus Lawrence has not been what they envisioned when they drafted him in the 2d round.  Some of it is due to his injury in his first year, some to his suspension this year, some to the lack of lack of development due to his lost playing time, and some to the lack of performance by his teammates.  But 9 sacks in 30 games is disappointing.

Remember, he was scouted for the 2014 draft as having a first-round grade and being one of the best pass-rushing prospects in the draft.  Not saying the reasons haven't been valid, but he has not lived up to that.

That said, he did leave school early, and he's still young.  It would be nice to see him get through a training camp and play a full season.  So assuming he can do that next year, then we'll see. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Please don't judge me, but I've been a Cowboys fan a long time--longer than most redditors have been alive.  That said, over the past 20 years, they've been mediocre at best.  Their environment didn't change until Jerry Jones finally got out of his own way.  It's a complicated story, but in short he hired football guys and let them run football operations.

For the Browns ever to be successful again, Haslam will have to hire football guys and leave them alone.  He'll need to go out and get a good GM and then let the GM set up the organization.  And consistency matters.  4 coaches in 5 years is not the way to do it.  If Jerry can learn that he's his own worst enemy, anyone can.

I root for the Browns because I despise what Modell did, and I admire the pressure that Cleveland fans put on the NFL to regain a team.  As much as any NFL fans deserve success, its Browns fans.

All of that said, it's important to remember that fans have more in common with each other than they do with teams.  We're the ones out working and trying to make livings--we're the ones those players depend on for their livelihoods.  Kills me when fans are nasty to each other.  There's just no point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be fair, there's probably a continuum which allows for fans of all types.  I understand why some fans might think *once a Cowboy, always a Cowboy*, and clearly emotions come into play, as sometimes a fan connects for some reason to a player's story.  There's nothing wrong with that.  

However, some fans only care about a guy as long as he's wearing the star.  Nothing wrong with that, either.

Conflict arises, maybe, when those 2 types of fans disagree with each other as to the nature of loyalty.  Both sides have valid perspectives.  

As a mod, I'd like to see a little more understanding from both sides, just to keep the peace in the family.  Not always so easy, though. </TEXT>

What I *can* say is that if they complain to us, we'll review a user's history first to see if they're actually involved in our sub and then to see if they actually trolled the other sub.  Civil discussion of the game isn't trolling; pointing out that X player said Y isn't trolling; etc.  But if someone gets in there and in all caps starts going nuts, etc., getting personal, and so on--we all generally recognize trolling when we see it--then we'll act on it.

<TEXT> We have run into situations involving users who attempt to dox mods, to attack mods with the release of personal information across multiple subs, including the posting of children's photos, names and addresses.  We have needed the cooperation of admins and mods to get these types of situations under control.  For obvious reasons I'm not going to go into a lot of detail about the communications that have occurred then.  

But any individual user's right to troll another subreddit pales in comparison to that.  I mean, it's not even a conversation.  But to ensure that mods get the cooperation they need, we have to get along.

The continuum runs all the way down simply to the level where other subbies are banned from other subs simply because they're Cowboys fans.

Thing to realize is that, like it or not, we represent each other.  Yeah, yeah, it's bullshit.  Except it's not.  When we receive a report from a mod, we examine the user's history to see if he's active in our sub; then we look for the reported conduct; then we evaluate whether it's objectionable; then we implement whatever ban.

But so if a user who's been active in our sub goes in and starts telling team X's fans, for instance, that they suck player X's childrens' dicks, we have a problem.  

Edit: just realized only the first half of this post really answers your question. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand where you're coming from.  You've been on reddit a long time, and you've seen all kinds of things, just like a lot of the long-timers.  I see that you're looking at this from the perspective of an individual's expectations as to what he should be allowed to do online and the consequences of his behavior.
  
But there are ways to vent that have nothing to do with trampling on other people's expectations, violating expected rules of civility, or interfering with other people's relationships.  

And reddit is not just about an individual's efforts to communicate.  It's also about the people who own/run it and the people who volunteer to help.  We have considerations too.

This all boils down to what we're expected to do when other mods complain to us about the conduct of a few.  We do not believe that because a few people want to troll other subs Cowboys fans should face hostile environments in those subs.  And, like it or not, we do have to work with other mods.

This post is not a formality.  It's an attempt to discuss something we haven't particularly wanted to do.  And it's giving us a lot of feedback about ways we might implement this policy--which isn't one that we've rushed to follow, as apparently we're one of the last NFL subs to do it--and things to consider. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah--we don't ban just because someone shows up in another sub.  And trash-talk itself isn't particularly an issue for us (though sometimes it is for other subs' mods).  The more significant bans are based on conduct which goes far beyond that--and would be objectionable anywhere.

Realize: just because a mod tells us that X user was banned doesn't mean we're going to do the same.  Instead, we review the user's history and try to respond as appropriately as possible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To go with what SK says, so far we haven't hit any situations where we felt the need to contact other mods.  For us, removal and bans (if appropriate) have been fine.  

But we recognize that other mods may be more sensitive.  And it's not entirely their faults that they're not fans of the greatest football team ever.  So we cut them some slack.

Mainly for us what this is about is ensuring that we have cooperative relationships with other mods; a second benefit is encouraging civil, mature behavior.  Again, we're not reddit police.  But all of us probably recognize that some kinds of comments are less objectionable than others.  There is a continuum.  And at the far end of it, bans can be appropriate.

<TEXT> In fact, a number of the complained-about actions simply were users somewhat politely pointing out that the Redskins sucked.  :)  In those cases, generally we just sent pms or 1- or 2-day bans (which we lifted after our subbies acknowledged the issue). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most of the reports we received this weekend were for relatively mild conduct.  In those cases, we either simply sent pms or set 1- or 2-day bans just to get the users to respond.  In all of those cases, the users were cool, recognized that they simply got excited, and weren't thinking about what they were doing.

In most of the others, no question we would have banned them from this sub if they'd said those things here.

But to answer your question, bans here require more than flair. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That was our initial response--until we realized that makes it far more difficult for our subbies to encounter welcoming audiences in those subs.

Simplest solution: as a user, pretend that you're looking at the faces of the people you're talking to.

It's not grade school at all.  Society has expected rules of behavior.  And reddit has been around long enough for those rules to start to filter through.  In short, in life you're accountable for what you say.  Separate and apart from this policy, I don't see anything at all wrong with applying the same standard of accountability online. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We'll implement whatever type of ban we think appropriate.

Contrary to what some people seem to think, we're not power-hungry, and our personal lives actually are pretty good.  We don't ban users just because we can--it's not fair, and honestly it's not worth the aggravation.  In that regard, we're kind of like the police.  A ban creates extra work.  

That said, we are unpaid volunteers, and we all have jobs and families, and we will put up with grief and aggravation only to a certain point.  When any user becomes more trouble than he's worth, we stop sympathizing.

Also, another thing to remember is that sometimes bans are implemented simply to initiate dialogues, as some types of users won't respond otherwise, and for the most part we have no idea initially with which type of person we're dealing.

Also, just like you say, something to remember is that any user's response to a ban can have an impact on the length/severity of the ban.  For instance, if a user recognizes that what he did might have been out of line, we may go a lot easier than on someone who, for instance, as one troll did recently, told us to *go suck romo's dick, faggot*.

In short, we don't care what anyone does anywhere else.  But when/if a person becomes a problem for our relationship with another mod, we're going to care.

Or simply behave like an adult and this never should be an issue. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This appears to be a throwaway account, so I'm not sure you'll ever see this.  But I can hope I guess.  Ha!  I can have faith.

Anyway, the problem is that faith doesn't have to do with intellect.  You don't want a response based on Christian/catholic ideas, but the definition in the Bible, without getting all religious about it, is a pretty good one: *the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen*.  

Probably could spend years trying to understand that.

And notice it doesn't necessarily require a belief in religion.  It can be important to separate the idea of *religion*, defined as a conduct based on a belief, from the belief itself.

What I've found is that many religions fail because they don't account for so many aspects of our lives, or their adherents violate the tenets of their own beliefs by being judgmental/angry.

Faith doesn't seem to be about those things.  It seems to me to be rooted in humility, as it requires a confidence first in something other than ourselves, and second perhaps in something greater.

These days a lot of people have trouble believing in anything other than themselves, even while they screw up their lives in so many ways.  Even the things/people in which they purportedly do believe simply mirror their biases or serve as bases for confirmation bias.

But faith is something other than that.  Humility, yes.  Maybe trust, too.  Trust in your ability to perceive, but also trust in the quality of the other.

This might only have to do with God in the same sense that Arthur C. Clarke said, *"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."*  But to say that God is simply something/one we don't understand doesn't quite work, does it?  Because that suggests, like chaos theory, that given enough time/study we could understand God.  But who's to say we couldn't?

There's a great quotation, from The Thin Red Line, that I quote on Reddit all the time: *One man looks at a dying bird and thinks there's nothing but unanswered pain. That death's got the final word, it's laughing at him. Another man sees that same bird, feels the glory, feels something smiling through it.*  

I am that second person.  Maybe it's just the glory of existence, I dunno.  But it's enough to give me faith.  In what I do not feel compelled to try to answer.  But it's enough. </TEXT>

Here's a review of [The Cartel](http://www.newsweek.com/2015/07/10/cartel-your-annual-reminder-war-drugs-isnt-over-347085.html).  It definitely has spoilers.

Before I read them, I'd seen the comparisons to The Godfather.  I thought, *nah, how could it?*  But wow.

Great quotation from the article: *People go out and buy their weed, and while I dont see anything wrong with the drug itself, I see the way it arrives to us: through murders, through slave labor, through women who have been gang-raped. We dont seem to have a problem purchasing thatbut well boycott Starbucks."*

Step 3 in that process seems not so intuitive to us!

The 300 * number above the radical + 30 * number above the radical * x + x^2 part.

Where's the 300 come from?  And why's it times the number above the radical?  And why the 30?  And the x + x (squared)?

<TEXT> That's a great answer for long division!  Thank you. 

As for the development of the process, I found this explanation: *In a Greasham College lecture by Robin Wilson at Barnard's Inn Hall in London, he credited the invention of the modern long division process to Briggs, "The first Gresham Professor of Geometry, in early 1597, was Henry Briggs, who invented the method of long division that we all learnt at school"*  [here](http://pballew.blogspot.com/2013/10/division-some-notes-on-history-of.html).

<TEXT> I speak for the whole mod team in wishing every one of our subbies a happy Thanksgiving.  This year, with the team's success, we have a lot to be thankful for.  It's been a magical season so far, and no matter what happens the rest of the way, I'm guessing we'd all agree that it seems that, at long last, the Cowboys have changed the direction of their franchise.  Yay for them and yay for us!

Also, speaking personally, I am thankful to be a moderator of this sub.  The mods themselves are all terrific; each one brings something different to the mod team.  They are thoughtful, rabid fans, not just of the Cowboys, but also of all our subbies, and they work hard behind the scenes to keep the sub running optimally and to work as part of a team.  Thank you; you are each my mod brother.

I also feel thankful for our subbies.  You guys are awesome!  Fractious, insightful, cantankerous, funny, fanatical--you also, as I often say, are the most knowledgeable group of Cowboys fans I've ever found.  It has been a pleasure to talk with you, tease you, learn from/with you, and have my own mistakes noted (sometimes far too often (sigh)).  

Going forward, please, always let us know what you think via the [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fcowboys) button.  We are very interested in your opinions and appreciate every opportunity to consider your ideas.

You make this sub special.  Thank you.

And again, happy Thanksgiving everyone!

Now let's root for the Cowboys to beat those stinkin' Redskins.  Redskins fans wanted the Cowboys?  Fine.  You got 'em!  Let this lesson fall under *be careful what you ask for*.  Go 'Pokes! </TEXT>

<TEXT> In no particular order:  
  
1) I read to them every night of their lives while they were small.  
2) I told them stories after reading to them every night of their lives when they were small.  
3) I stayed with them until they fell asleep every night of their lives when they were small.  
4) Their first Broadway show.  
5) Their sibling is their best friend.  
  
6) I carried them everywhere as often as I could until they finally got too big for me to do it.  
7) I always had time for them.  
8) No question was ever too silly or unimportant.  
9) In fact, the sillier the question the better.  
10) I loved nothing better than snuggling with them.  
    
11) They were gifts to me for not giving up after [my difficult early life](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/rr0bl/im_not_really_sure_if_i_should_ask_this_question/c47zg09).  
12) Every single day as their dad has been a gift and better than the one before.  
13) Their mother changed my life for the better.  
14) Being smart only gets you into the waiting room. Being smart and working hard gets you into the room with the toys.  
15) We are lucky in all that we have.  
  
16) We are the universe expressing itself as people.  
17) I love them with all my heart.  
18) I am lucky to be their dad.  
19) Play is important.  
20) Achievement is important.  
  
21) Working hard and doing your best is important.  
22) If you're going to do something you might as well do it right.  
23) I always had glue and tape.  
24) I always had bandaids and soft words for boo-boos.  
25) Hugs and kisses were the best kinds of money. 
  
26) Share with the same generosity that's been shown to you.  
27) I am a master tickler.  
28) Doing it matters more than just saying you'll do it.  
29) Watch how we (parents) behave and practice that.  
30) It's not whether you make a mistake that matters--we all make mistakes.  It's what you do once you have that defines a person.

31) I've written letters to their future selves on every birthday, to be delivered upon my death or when they turn 18, whichever comes first.  (I'm rooting for the latter).  
32) I expect them to listen.  (Note: I don't mean to obey, but to hear, the same way I listen to them.)  
33) I only give orders when they are necessary.
  
I'll add more as I think of them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What a great horror movie!  A slow build, the incredible juxtaposition of living as a woman in Tehran at the time of the cultural revolution and the war with Iraq, and then *that final reel!*

I can't recommend this movie highly enough.  Not a false step in it.  Tense, scary, extremely stylishly done.  Anyone who liked It Follows or The Babadook (i.e., almost everyone) will love this.  

You guys have something to look forward to, seriously.

Here--watch [the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHVFP80Upxw).  Then realize: the movie is even better. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-09-21 14:51:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In the early 70s I read a book on Americana, which consisted of a series of articles, editorial cartoons, and similar material.  It may have been a compilation from Time or Colliers or something like that.

It was hard back and somewhat oversized.  I remember that it had some material about Native Americans.

Also I remember an editorial cartoon in which a child was in a store, reading from a list to a storekeeper behind a counter.  The list was really long and consisted of things his mother wanted him to buy.  At the end of the list, he said, "And my mother says with the change from the dollar I can buy some candy".

I have been looking for this book for 40+ years. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-08-05 21:08:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> At the beginning of 2016, Easton announced that it wasn't going to recertify quite a few bats--clearly as a cost-saving measure which was unrelated to safety.  ASA rules require companies which decline to recertify bats to offer recalls; today I was told by Easton that it had opened a short window with no announcement whatsoever in which to return bats.  So upon learning last weekend that my bat hadn't been recertified, I immediately contacted Easton--only to be told the time period to exchange the bat had expired.  

Even worse, they took my name/number and said someone would call me back.  No one ever called.
  
My cost-saving measure: I'll never buy Easton again. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [help] I can't remove an old theme! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-02 05:01:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm hoping someone can help.  Some years back I installed a theme, and now I can't remove it.  My reset to default theme is grayed out.  (As an FYI I think it actually was called a "background" back then, as it was used for my google.com page only.)

No matter what I try, the remnant of the old theme remains.  This manifests via a really ugly google.com page.

I have tried:  
(1) using the chrome cleanup tool;  
(2) uninstalling chrome, deleting a google key via regedit, and reinstalling chrome;  
(3) creating a new profile;  
(4) installing a new theme and removing it (the reset to default button activated only long enough to allow me to remove the new theme--reverting the google.com page to the ugly old (*not* default) theme);  
and probably some other steps I can't recall.

I would appreciate any/all suggestions about how to fix this problem.  I would think that removing every trace of chrome from my pc and then reinstalling it would fix it--I thought I'd done that in step (2)--but that didn't work.

Help?

[Edit: I found a workaround!  Posted in the comments.  I'm leaving this up in case others encounter this problem.]

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We're delighted to announce the addition of /u/Superkerfuz to our moderation team!  He's a great guy, a long-time Cowboys fan, and a member of our sub since before there even was an internets.  Welcome him and direct all requests for free loot to him.

Also, we are announcing a change in our policy toward memes! We've been discussing this since the end of the season, and the mod team agrees: it's time for memes! But in order to balance the interests of those who like/appreciate memes with those who come here only for news, memes will be restricted to comments only. 

**Any memes posted as top-level posts will be removed.**  
  
Additionally, all such posts will be subject to our other rules, so be sure they're clever, pithy, and on point.

We expect this to be an interim step until/if we implement tags. 

In the meantime, enjoy your newfound memesy-ness! </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-05-07 06:01:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's been a rough week, and to try to find some peace I've resorted to watching one of the most transformative films I've ever seen--[Koyaanisqatsi](http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/koyaanisqatsi-1983) (link is to Ebert's review of the movie (hint: he kind of missed the point)).  I first saw it many years ago now, when I was far younger and simultaneously more fearful and filled with hope than I am now.

I have seen so many ideals fall away as I've grown, as I've seen dreams, prospects, communities damaged by the simple facts of our humanity.  I wonder sometimes about love, why trust is more important, about motives and the senselessness with which we often think that anything we believe matters in the vastness of the universe.  I'm troubled; I admit it.

Sometimes it feels as though I am at the center of a great circle of connectedness and other times I feel utterly alone.

I dream sometimes that after death I'd be able to soar around and see the cosmos. </TEXT>

Her right hand is dominant, but I would like her first to learn how to bat as a lefty.  However, I also don't want to make the job of learning harder for her.
I'm not particularly concerned about whether she ever learns to switch-hit.  Thank you in advance for your thoughts!

<TITLE> How important is it to know how to calculate cube/square roots? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-15 14:03:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My son is 9, in 4th grade, and very advanced at math. So advanced, in fact, that he's on the verge of completing an 8th grade course from a gifted   talented middle school.  He'll have done 6th, 7th, and 8th grade from that school during this school year.  He's ready for algebra and I fully anticipate he'll be ready for calculus by 6th grade.  

Mostly I've been teaching him, though to a significant extent he's self-taught.

In any event, he's recently begun studying cube roots, and this raised a question for me: how important is it to learn how to calculate cube roots?  Based on what I've seen online, while it can be done by hand, the method to do so is somewhat complicated, [akin to long division](http://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-Cube-Root-by-Hand).  Which isn't an issue in itself, if that's the way it's done.  This led me to my next question: how important is it to know how to calculate square roots?

He understands the concepts, and I'm wondering the extent to which memorization would help in the process.

Anyhow, I'm hoping a math teacher here could give me some guidance on how this concept is taught.  Thank you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since XCom2 has come out, I've finally decided to play XCom EU!  I only want to use one mod--commander's choice (which lets me set the soldier class).  But every time I try to apply the mod I get the message "error patching upk".  I would appreciate help!

Game is in games\steam\steamapps\common\xcom-enemy-unknown.  Mod is in games...\xcom-enemy-unknown\patchergui\mods.

I am using patcherGUI v. 7.3 which I got from nexus mods.  I am using the upktools that came with patcherGUI.  I am using the commander's choice file which I also got from nexus mods.

I have indicated the correct directories in patcherGUI.  I disabled hash check.  
The debug log shows an error in the mod (apparently), down near the bottom.  I'd appreciate any suggestions on how to fix this!

<TEXT> This was going to be an /r/tipofmyjoystick kind of post, until by sheer chance I guessed at the name of the game I was going to describe.  As the game itself is 20+ years old, I suppose it would require the patience of a mountain to have waited so long to play this one.

But many years ago there was a CRPG which,  from what I remember, had very basic graphics consisting of a map which uncovered with every step you took.  You had a party, kind of like in Wizardry, and somehow you could outfit them with gear, buy/sell exit the maze (again like Wizardry) and then descend again to explore.  In retrospect, pretty much it was a Wizardry knockoff, only with less graphics and bigger maps.

Despite its name, it had nothing to do with Lord of the Rings.

I remember the game as great fun and hard as heck.

Anyway, as I said, while I was preparing this as a question, I took a wild guess at its name--and I was right!  It was a great/hard game for its time, and (drum-roll please): here's [a site](http://www.decklinsdemise.com/index.htm)  dedicated to it.

And apparently there's a [Grimrock mod based on it](http://www.nexusmods.com/grimrock/mods/44/?)!

So I guess a few people remember it.  Which is kind of cool.  

Edit: as a followup, I ordered a boxed copy of the original (could've sworn I had it around somewhere), and it's taken some configuring to get the demo to run on a Win 7 64-bit system.  Basically required using XP mode and tracking down a few DLLs.  But it works! </TEXT>

<TITLE> [TOMT][Movie] Movie like Enemy of the State which features 2 guys leaping down onto a moving train/subway car </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I could've *sworn* the movie *was* Enemy of the State, however it doesn't have a scene like this.  

Anyway, some movie I saw which came out in the past 20 years, which was *like* Enemy of the State had a scene--or maybe it just was in the trailer, hm--anyway, two guys, one of whom I could've sworn was Gene Hackman, jump down onto a moving train, maybe from a bridge, maybe in a train yard, to escape from surveillance guys.

I don't think it was Spy Games, but maybe this is an excuse to watch that movie again.  Anyhow I'd appreciate your help if you have any suggestions about which movie this was. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Questions about e-readers </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm trying to transition from a kindle to a tab s, and I have a few  questions about e-readers:  
1) Is there an e-reader that will allow me to view epubs and mobis without having to de-DRM the books I buy from Kindle first?  
  
2) If the answer is no, how do you guys manage to read both?     
  
3) Is there a way to disable the recommendations that Amazon sticks at the bottom of the kindle app screen?  
  
Thank you for your help!

P.S. I searched the sub before posting this but didn't find an answer. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Galaxy Tab S 8.4 or 10.5? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-09 18:40:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been using a Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 for a long time, but I'd like to be able to add memory that doesn't involve Amazon's cloud.  So I've been looking to switch to a new device.  I could use you guys' advice.  Based on the reviews I've read, the S sounds a little better, due chiefly to battery life, though the S2 is lighter, maybe pixel density, and the aspect ratio.  

So this is pointing me toward the S, but so my question is: which size would you recommend?  10.5 is bigger than the Kindle, and 8.4 is a little smaller.  The difference between those and the 8.9 isn't enormous, but....

Mostly I used my device for reading, browsing, some games (Pixel Dungeon).

Thank you for any suggestions you can provide! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Question about backpack weight (empty) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-11 15:20:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Typically I use my backpack to commute and as a carryon for trips.  For 7 years I've used [the Jansport Equinox](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G1QD4U?psc=1 redirect=true ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage), which is listed at 1.6 pounds.  But it's starting to wear out so I have to find a new one. 

The [Swissgear 1900](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006HFJA12?keywords=swissgear%201900 qid=1449843384 ref_=sr_1_1 sr=8-1) gets rave reviews on Amazon, but it lists at 3.2 pounds.  As that's double the weight of the backpack I've used for years, I'm hesitant to buy it.  So I would appreciate  any observations/opinions about just how noticeable this difference would be.  Also, I don't use a laptop, so the whole laptop aspect of that backpack is irrelevant to me--in effect it just would be wasted space.

I would like a couple more pockets than the Equinox had.  Also, the Equinox is pretty roomy--18 x 14.5 x 6.8--whereas the Swissgear 1900 is listed at 15 x 2 x 11.

Anyhow, thanks for any useful info/opinions youi can provide! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Hard drive has disappeared </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-10-24 19:16:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I use windows 7 64bit with 6 hard drives; 1 of the hard drives is a Samsung solid state 840 evo (I think); the others all are western digital drives, ranging in size from 1 to 4 tb.  I have not changed any hardware or configured the drives on this system in at least a year.  Today, though, when I turned on my machine, a hard drive had disappeared.

When I boot, one of my disk controllers is a Marvell 88SE91xx.  4 of the drives appear in my regular bios screen; I'm not sure but I think the other 2 were controlled by the Marvell controller (the one that disappeared is 3tb I believe).  I am wondering if the Marvell controller may be reflecting the problem, because it seems to take a long time to initialize.  Only one physical drive appears in the Marvell controller bootup screen.

Before I jump to the idea that the drive has failed (would be the first time ever for me in 30+ years, so maybe I'm overdue), I'd like to check other possibilities first.  I don't think this drive is that old--3tb so it can't be SO old.  

But I haven't been able to find a good step-by-step troubleshooting guide anywhere.

I don't overclock or anything and that drive is mostly just kids videos so it hasn't been heavily used at all.  I'm thinking either software setting, cable, drive, controller.  Seems a little premature to swap out a drive and see if the Marvell controller sees it.  Machine hasn't been shaken or anything so I doubt connections would be loose. 

I don't even know where to begin as far as providing info sufficient for me to get help.  So I would appreciate your patience and guidance as to what info I should give.  Thank you.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I don't remember a lot of details, unfortunately.  But some years back I remember discussing with a friend a book in which it turns out that the Bible and/or religion was created by Satan as a way to deceive us.  It might have been...no I don't think it was written by Kazantzakis.  Though over the years I did link the 2 books (and The Satanic Verses) in my mind.  For obvious reasons I guess.

Anyway, thank you for any help you can provide!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Any good informational sites about verbal tics? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-27 05:45:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I apologize if this isn't the right place to ask this.

My son, 8, a brilliant and gentle little boy, earlier in life (around the age of 4-5) had a kind of throat-clearing tic which eventually went away.  Over the past few months, he's developed a kind of purring, cooing sound that happens mostly when he's...well, I think of it as kind of in an unfocused resting state--while he's playing, in bed getting ready for sleep, and so on.

I'm just beginning to educate myself about what might be going on.  I don't think he has ADHD; I just haven't seen any other symptoms.  OCD maybe.  His focus has proven to be strong at times, and he's had a fascination with his belly button that seems to appear at times of stress.

Though generally we've protected him from most forms of stress, (in my ignorance) I'm wondering, if it's not neurological, whether it might have environmental causes.

Also I'm wondering if it's something he'll outgrow.

Anyway, we're preparing to talk with his pediatrician, possibly to see if an extensive blood test might provide some insight, maybe a neuropsych consult.  

We're not discussing it with our son at all; don't worry about that.  I find the tic somewhat comforting; it's just my little boy being himself.  But I worry that if it continues it might become a social issue for him one day.

Thank you for any help you can provide.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Question about increasing memory on Galaxy S5 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-06-26 14:32:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi.  I have a Galaxy S5, and I'm trying to figure out how I might increase its memory.  Right now I don't have any real reason to, but I'm trying to learn how to make the phone more useful to me, so I figured I'd ask.  
  
Currently the phone has what I think is a little sim card which, based on what I'm reading online, only can hold a relatively limited amount of data.  If I wanted to increase the storage capacity of the phone, what would I need to do?  Buy another SIM card?  Or would it be better for me to buy an SD card?  And would I basically need to swap the cards back and forth?  
  
Would I interfere with my cell phone's functionality if I installed a different card?  (Seems like I'd read that these cards were how the phone companies identified their customers' phones.)  
  
Sorry for so many newbie questions!  But thank you very much for any info you can provide. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Any way to slow down The Witcher (first game) for a modern machine? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I wanted to replay it, and instead of reinstalling it from my original disks, I took advantage of the Steam sale to download it.  But the game runs a little fast; Geralt zips around almost like he's on ice.  This is particularly noticeable when he's standing still, then starts to move--in effect he glides for the first several steps.

It's not as bad as really old games, but....

So I figured I'd ask if anyone knew a way to slow it down?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not a B movie; probably like a D movie.  Black and white almost certainly.  
  
I seem to remember the woman's husband had died; maybe the aliens had taken him over.  Whenever the eyes would get superimposed onto the screen it would mean the aliens either were controlling the person shown or trying to communicate (I don't remember).  

I seem to remember it had some innocuous title like *Night People*.  But nope that's a Gregory Peck movie.
  
It is *not* Killers From Space (though those aliens have big eyes).    
  
Thanks in advance for any help! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Weird problem with Acer XG270HU </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-04 13:48:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After receiving advice here about which type of 1440 monitor to buy, I ordered [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Acer-XG270HU-omidpx-FREESYNC-Widescreen/dp/B00VRCLHYS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1430740115 sr=8-1 keywords=acer+xg270hu) from Amazon.  The first arrived with 2 little scratches in the lower right.  So I contacted Amazon, which facilitated an exchange.  Then, when I unpacked the second one, I saw that it had these weird streaks, which looked almost like rub marks, near the lower right, very close to the area where the scratches had been in the other one!

I was very careful unpacking them and I'm certain I didn't cause the defects.  Particularly given how new the monitor is, I'm curious if anyone else has encountered this problem?   </TEXT>

<TITLE> As of this minute my life has been longer than either of my parents </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-28 05:22:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's a strange feeling.  My father died when I was very young, my mother a few years later.  I'd grown up with a sense of loss, thinking of my father maybe not so much as old, but simply an adult.  

I'd passed the number of years he'd lived a couple of years ago.  I can't say it was cathartic; there was no great revelation.  Not even of my own mortality, as I'd lived with that sense my entire life.  Just a realization: my father's life encapsulated.  In the time I'd had.  As incomplete as my life had seemed, it was all the time he ever was to have.  Increasingly mystified by the fact that I first became a father at the same age as my father.

And then this, like the tolling of a clock, ticking down the intervening years.  To see my mother's life as a whole.  

What a hard life she had, trying to raise children on what I once calculated was the equivalent of about $5.80/hour in today's dollars.  What an unhappy life she had.  She would come home at night, sometimes cry.  For years.  Read books.  They were her respite.  Zane Grey.  Doc Savage.  Science fiction.  Anything to take her away.

I was her hope.  She used to tell me I would support her in her old age.  The joke was on her, though.  On us both.  

I still don't have answers.  Except that we don't last.  None of us.  My parents.  All who've come before us.  Your parents.  Me.  You.  

We are the universe expressing itself as human.  Yet it tires of each word so quickly. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I seem to remember, way back when the game first came out, that in one of those big vertical silos in Blight Town, a glowy was out on one of those horizontal logs, and you had to do these really harrowing drops to get to it.

But recently I haven't seen it.  Am I imagining this?  Or am I just missing it on the latest play-throughs?

Thanks for not making too much fun of me about this.  I'm hardly an expert in the game.  I just like it a lot! </TEXT>

<TITLE> How to teach an 8 year old about light? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-12 04:28:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My 8 year old is somewhat advanced mathematically. For instance, I expect him to be learning calculus by the time he's 10. So he can handle slightly more advanced considerations in science. 

He is asking me these days about light, and I would like to explain issues like wave lengths to him in a way he would understand, but I'm not sure how to do it.  He's seen a prism, of course, but I don't know how to explain how it works to him.

Would anyone know of any resources I could use to teach him about light, frequencies, wave lengths, heat, and maybe very basic explanations of quantum issues?

I'm pretty sure he could grasp concepts quickly if I just knew how to teach him.

To give you an example of how I helped him understand gravity's effect on space, I showed him [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTY1Kje0yLg).

To introduce him to the idea of air resistance and Einstein's idea that gravity may not exist I showed him [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E43-CfukEgs).

I don't necessarily need a video.  A book aimed at an 8-10 year old's vocabulary would work too!

Thank you for any suggestions you could provide.

<TITLE> Father of twin newborns whose mother died from a car crash moments after giving birth to them needs help </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-11 01:36:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Title is kind of convoluted.  I wasn't sure how to describe it, though.

But a South Carolina mother gave birth to twins (29 weeks) moments after being involved in a car crash--then died.  The newborns of course are in critical condition.

I don't have anything to do with this father or his family.  Never met them.  I just read the story.  

And [the story is heartbreaking](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/dying-pregnant-mother-newborn-twins-death-dad-article-1.2072447), but apparently entirely authentic.  The employees of the restaurant where the mother worked have set up [a gofundme account here](http://www.gofundme.com/AshtonHughes).

Quick note to the mods: if this doesn't belong here, please remove it.  It's just so incredibly sad.

I've got to quit reading about things like this.  I can't take it.  But those little ones need help.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here you go everyone!  No fair waiting until a game is over!

Copy and paste, then bold the team you think is going to win for bragging rights.  (Never seen the point in guessing the score.  You can put it if you want I guess.  But it's not necessary!)  

I'll start.

**BAL** at NE  
  
CAR  at **SEA**  
  
**DAL**  at GB  
  
IND  at **DEN**

Yeah yeah we could've done the wildcard round, but I didn't think of this until just now.  So maybe next year we'll start earlier!

Probably there's a better way to do this.  Hm.  Oh well.

<TITLE> DSFix causes glitch with boss health bars? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-10 20:45:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As long as I've been using DSFix (updated to 2.3.1 today), I've had a glitch with bosses' health bars.  I get a big yellow bar near the middle of the screen, then a smaller red bar near the lower left.  As I damage the boss, at first nothing happens.  Eventually the red bar begins to drop until I kill the boss.

Has anyone else had this problem?  Any suggestions on how to correct it?

I generally have AA off (in game and in DSFix).  This happened on my old system and on my newer one, so I don't think it's related to my hardware.  In any event, I run Win7 64 bit 16M RAM and I have 2 GTX 780TIs.

Thanks for any info you can provide! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Recently I so hated an update to my kindle fire hdx 8.9 that I called and complained, and Amazon reverted my kindle to the prior version.  Amazon also told me I wouldn't receive updates again unless I asked for them.  In short I hadn't liked the updated version because of a change it had made to the carrousel.

Anyway, now I'm reading about the Family Plan, and how it requires an update.  So what I'd like to do is update to the new version with the possibility of reverting again if the problem I'd had with the carrousel hasn't been corrected.

I'd appreciate any information about how to save a prior version!  Thank you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The video was posted on reddit (where I saw it).  It was a high school/college band.  Looked like they were performing inside a church; the video cut off the very beginning (from what I remember).  Video may have been on a cell phone.  Sound quality wasn't the best.  But the performance was terrific.

Thank you for any info you can provide! </TEXT>

Anyhow, I have an 8.9 Fire HDX.  I love it (after thinking before my wife got it for me that I wouldn't).  But I very much would like if Amazon would make the next version's memory upgradeable.  Yeah, yeah, the cloud.  But some sort of pop-in add-on would be nice.  I mean geez I have thumb drives that hold more than my Kindle. </TEXT>

<TITLE> A light netbook-type laptop for my wife? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-11 13:38:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My wife loved an old Asus netbook because it was small, light, and had a keyboard.  She dropped it recently, though, and it no longer works.  I'm trying to find a replacement for her and would appreciate any advice!  She uses it pretty much solely for word-processing.  Weight and footprint are big deals for her because she carries a lot of stuff.

**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

* Country of purchase: US

* Budget range: Up to $1500 (cheaper the better of course)

* Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): netbook/ultraportable for word-processing

* Screen size preference: doesn't matter

* OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux): windows

* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): n/a

* Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.): n/a

* Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support): none

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business 
compatibility): n/a

* Any particular style that you like (examples are great): probably she'd prefer win 7

* Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one, the other, or balanced)

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight: weight

* Build quality -vs- Low price: balanced

* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: low heat

**Would you pay a premium for something that has:**

* High resolution screen: no

* A great keyboard: functional keyboard necessary otherwise n/a

* A great touchpad/mouse buttons: functional ones

* Great audio: n/a

**List any features that are critical:** (e.g. Optical drive, USB 3.0, SD card slot, ethernet port, HDMI port, bluetooth, VGA port, removable battery, glossy screen, matte screen, etc.): USB slot for her thumb drive </TEXT>

<TITLE> Please help me identify a movie </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-06 07:40:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have posted this question in r/tipofmytongue, but they haven't been able to help.  I am looking to identify a movie I saw some time back--I'm not sure exactly when, but it was made in approximately the last 20 years.

It is a zombie movie, not a monster movie.  In it, a female heroine dies at the end, possibly after the credits, on a road, possibly near an RV/after getting out of an RV.  It is not Diary of the Dead or Cabin in the Woods.  

The movie's production values are too high for it to have been anything by Argento or Fulci.  I'm reasonably sure it wasn't anything by Romero, as I'm fully familiar with those movies.  

I don't think it was a remake of one of Romero's movies, either, as I remember how the characters fared at the end in those (Night of the Living Dead--girl finds hunters; Dawn of the Dead, they make it to an island where zombies attack them).

I don't think it was any of the Return of the Living Dead Movies, as only the first one really was good (and I definitely remember its ending).

I am at a loss.  The girl with others escapes from somewhere, only to die (possibly after the credits).

Anyhow, thank you for any help you can provide. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The movie was relatively recent--last 20 years.  All I remember is that it seemed as though the female heroine survived, probably with others, and as they were traveling along the road, they stopped for something and she was bitten.  Maybe after the credits, but I don't think so.

Not the remake of Dawn of the Dead, for sure, where they wound up on the island.  In this they were on the road.  I think they may have been traveling in an RV.

Thank you for any help! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Thank you for prior help (and now a question about a Cisco-Linksys WAP54G) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-27 23:15:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A few days ago, [as can be seen here](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/2dr4ej/help_adding_second_router), you guys helped me decide to set up a wireless access point; I was trying to figure out how to strengthen the signal of my home wi-fi network on the second floor of our house.

Following your advice, I bought a Linksys WAP54G.  I configured it as an access point, and it definitely strengthened the signal.  Thank you!

But now I have a question.  Previously (using a FIOS wireless router provided by Verizon), whenever I opened my Kindle it automatically connected to my home network.  After I added the access point, when I open the Kindle it shows as connected, but I have to turn off wi-fi and then turn it back on before I can access the net.

I did not change any settings on the original router or on the Kindle, so it seems that there's some setting in the WAP54G I need to change so I can avoid having to take the extra step every time I want to use the Kindle at home.

I just don't know what setting it might be or if this "feature" is simply an unavoidable part of the WAP54G.

Could someone possibly tell me what setting this might be?

Thank you for any info/insight you can provide. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Help adding second router </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-17 00:03:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a FIOS system which connects to a router in my basement.  Our pcs connect to it via ethernet and our portable devices connect to it via wi-fi.

I would like to strengthen our wi-fi signal for the use of portable devices throughout the rest of the house.  I understand I could add a repeater.  However, I also understand that I could add a second router, and that this would avoid any signal strength issues which a repeater might cause.

Accordingly, I would like to connect a second router through ethernet on our second floor and use both routers' wi-fi signals for our portable devices.

If I did this, what would be the 2 addresses for the routers?  Would I need to name the 2 devices the same thing and use the same passwords for each?  (Don't worry; they're complex passwords.)

Without addressing the issue of whether a repeater or a second router would be better (as I'm not asking about that), what other issues would I need to address in adding a second router?

I've found [this site](http://www.labnol.org/software/add-router-to-wireless-network/19716) which purportedly explains how to do it.  Do its instructions seem accurate/complete?

Thank you very much for your help!

<TEXT> As I mentioned elsewhere, recently my Kindle's screen broke, and while I was looking for solutions (resolved now), I came across listings for Amazon's [kindle insurance](http://www.amazon.com/2-Year-Protection-Accident-Coverage-Kindle/dp/B00DQGIIM2/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8 qid=1401461283 sr=8-2 keywords=kindle+insurance+8.9).  I figured it would be worthwhile to see if anyone who's purchased/used it had any useful observations about it.

Thanks for any useful feedback!

<DATE> 2014-02-28 23:35:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First, I apologize if this is the wrong sub for my question.  I was thinking maybe /r/CasualMath would be the sub but I couldn't tell which would be better.

Anyway, here's my question.  My 7 year old, a second grader, is very good at math.  He's so good that he's been doing math on the side for 2 years now (he doesn't get much support from school), and I expect he'll be done with 5th grade math by the end of the school year in May.

One problem I have is that he's been doing this work after school, and, though I'm not afraid of math and am okay at it, I'm not much of a teacher.  So I'm not sure if I'm simply introducing him to the concepts, since we're getting no reinforcement at school, or if he's actually learning the ideas.  He seems to be learning them, but....

Anyway, my question: are there things I can do to encourage his interest that won't burn him out?

I figure the redditors who frequent this sub must love math and so you'd be the perfect persons to ask.  

Thank you for any info/suggestions you can provide.

Edit: I'd like to thank everyone who's responded.  You guys have been awesome! You've given me lots of resources to consider.  Thank you!

<TITLE> Book recommendation </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've recently read a book which ostensibly is about the NY Jets.  But it's actually about life as an employee of an NFL football team--and it's one of the most educational football books I've ever read.  It's so educational, in fact, that it made me think I'd be a bad mod if I didn't tell you guys about it.  

So here it is: [Collision Low Crossers](http://www.amazon.com/Collision-Low-Crossers-Turbulent-Football/dp/0316196797/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8 sr=8-1 qid=1391351311), by Nicholas Dawidoff.

Dawidoff was given insider access to the Jets for the 2011 season, and what he wrote undoubtedly will educate *everyone* about the game.  It might make someone a Jets fan, which, lord help him/her, would be almost as bad as being a Cowboys fan (though they did make the AFC championship game 2 years in a row after the 2009/2010 seasons).  But that's a risk worth taking, because it would teach anyone a ton about the daily operations of a team.  

Read this book in the offseason, so next season we can at least *sound* like we know what we're talking about.  Cheers! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Question about Mark Davis </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-31 15:51:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys!  I'm a mod of r/Cowboys, and I have a question about Mark Davis.  For obvious reasons (as we're in the same boat that Raiders fans were in for years under Al, though maybe our boat actually is leakier), Cowboys fans tend to attach their hopes to Stephen Jones, Jerry's son.

But what's been your impression of Mark?  Better owner than his dad?  I mean, Al was great for a long time, but I guess he just got old, maybe.  Addled.  Anyhow, this question has been on my mind lately.  The Raiders have a great and storied franchise, and in my opinion one of the coolest logos in all of sports.  

So I'd appreciate your opinions about the changes under Mark, his skill set, and judgment.  Thanks in advance!

Edit: thanks guys for the feedback!  It was thoughtful and informational.  I appreciate it.

Only consolation I can provide: at least the Raiders have a GM.  (Big sigh.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> How do you keep from getting lost in the game?  Somewhere right after I finished Sen's Fortress I just started losing the ability to figure out where to go next.  And remembering all the possibilities just became complicated.  Do you take notes?

I'm a parent and I have a job/family, so I can't play nonstop.  But so any time away and I start to forget where to go.  

And keeping track of the story is next to impossible.  The big guy with the floppy ears, the guy down in the dark....It seems like I don't have enough info to figure out who to help and who not to help.  And people I miss!  The lady in the cage below Firelink Shrine, the guy up the stairs to the right at Firelink Shrine who disappears at some point.  It just seems like I'm missing the timing on a lot of stuff I should be doing.

I am *not* ragging on this game.  I love it!  Its combat is the best I've seen in some 30 years as a gamer.  But seriously how do you keep track of where to go/what to do?

Edit: thank you everyone for your great ideas and encouragement!  I'm particularly relieved that I'm not the only one experiencing this. </TEXT>

But then when I try to run it, I get what appears to be a loading/downloading screen (with a little bar), and then the activity stops with the message "Download failed because the resources could not be found".  

This happens whether or not wi-fi is on.

I've tried uninstalling/reinstalling, clearing the cache and data, and nothing works.

I've googled and haven't been able to figure out what's causing this.  Is this simply the message kindle provides when a game's not compatible with a device?  Or is something else going on?

<TITLE> The bad thing about being a Cowboys fan these days... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-12-16 16:05:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> ...is that there's no solution.  Jones won't fire himself, and if he fires Garrett there's no way that any competent established coach would take the job and last for more than a couple of seasons.  While coaching turnover generally is high in the league, turnover doesn't equate with success.  Instead, good coaches tend to stick around because they succeed.  But those coaches generally don't undergo the kind of interference that Jones creates.

The only coach who would succeed under Jones is one who doesn't care about the credit and who Jones would respect enough to leave alone to make football decisions (i.e., Garrett).  As we've seen with the drafts and, recently, the inexplicable extension of Scandrick's contract for no reason (which is a continuation of more of the same), Jones's decisions constantly hurt the team.

No good coach with an established record of success is going to put up with that.

The result is that if Jones fires Garrett, anyone he hires also will be unproven and/or most likely won't stick around.  Teams with coaching carousels don't win championships.

So there's no way out--except to hope that Garrett learns from his mistakes.  To be clear, based on what I'm reading, his mistake in the Packers debacle was his failure to clarify to Romo that the Cowboys needed to run the ball no matter what he saw when he came to the line.

I won't address Romo's own ignorance at calling pass plays when the primary need was to force the Packers to expend their timeouts.  That, at best, demonstrated Romo's distrust of his OL's ability to block well enough to succeed at running plays.

But all of the people calling for Garrett's head offer no realistic solution to the fundamental problem the team faces--and which won't be solved as long as Jones continues as GM.  And Jones owns the team and obviously loves his daily involvement in it, so he feels no pressure whatsoever to stop serving as GM.

This is why it's so difficult to be a Cowboys fan these days.  Rooting for the Cowboys unfortunately means rooting for Jones.  

We're stuck. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Plex installation problem: can't access PMS </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-11-19 01:40:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hopefully someone can help!  I installed Plex, no problem.  And after some finagling I was able to access PMS.  I even got 3 shows installed in the library!  But then for no apparent reason I couldn't access PMS anymore.  Which is to say: when I right-click on the tray icon and select media manager, it takes me to the Plex logo and stalls.

I tried uninstalling/reinstalling and doing a few other things, including accessing PMS through Chrome, Firefox, and Opera, with the same result.

THEN I tried accessing PMS via IE.  I received a message saying I needed to enable intranet, and when I did, suddenly I could get in!  Using IE is problematic, though, as I frankly don't use it at all.

I tried googling how to enable intranet in Firefox and tried a couple of things, but clearly I wasn't doing the right thing, as I still can't access PMS via Firefox.

What setting would be identical in Chrome, Firefox, and Opera that would prevent me from accessing PMS but would be fixed when I enabled intranets in IE?  This is a mystery!

Oh, ALSO!  I am able to access the server on my machine from a second machine!  That's obviously fubar; I'm blocking myself somehow but I don't know how. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I installed Plex on a 64-bit Win 7 system.  Installation seemed to be fine.  However, when I right-click on the tray icon and select Media Manager, it opens a browser and displays the Plex icon (an arrow), but won't do anything else.  It won't let me specify a server or anything else; I click on the screen and nothing happens.

This occurs whether I use IE, Chrome, Firefox, and even Opera.  

Things I've tried:  
1) uninstalling/reinstalling the program;  
2) turning off my firewall;  
3) turning the program off and back on;  
4) starting Firefox in safe mode to see if an add-on was causing the problem;  
5) based on a suggestion at the Plex site, I also tried resetting the system bundle;
6) tried opening the port on the router.    

All had the same result.

When I directly enter the address http://127.0.0.1:32400/web/index.html, it takes me to the same screen.

I would appreciate any suggestions on how to fix this.  I've posted on the Plex site but haven't received a useful response.

Thank you for any info/suggestions you can provide.

**Edit:** As posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/PleX/comments/1qdv6f/please_help_installationsetup_problem/cdc79cf), this problem somehow solved itself after I opened a log and pasted it on the Plex site.  No idea why this might have correlated to the solution, but it did.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As usual, feel free to agree/disagree.  Please just dont downvote anyones responses simply because you disagree.

**1)** This was a team loss, but not for the reason one might think.  This loss was all about depth, or lack thereof.  

In the fourth quarter, with the game on the line, at times the defensive backfield consisted of B.W. Webb, Jakar Hamilton, Jeff Heath, Scandrick, and Carr.  Theres a reason I mention the first names of those first three guys: you might not recognize them otherwise, as none of them were on the active roster even a week earlier.

But that was the group expected to cover possibly the best WR combo in the NFL.

Surprised that the Cowboys lost?  More surprising that they kept it close.

**2)** Depth is something I harp on repeatedly because the Cowboys dont have it.  No matter how good a teams stars, if it doesnt have adequate replacementsi.e., players who can come in and get the job done when starters are outthat team is going to struggle.

As discussed repeatedly in this sub, years of bad drafts had led to the decimation of the Cowboys depth.  Only *8 players* from the 6 drafts (dating back to 2005) prior to the Garrett era still are on the team: [Ware, Spears, Hatcher, Spencer, Free, Scandrick, Bryant, Lee](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/dal/draft.htm).  (I didnt go further back because given the brevity of the average NFL career it didnt seem fair.)  But 8 players out of a possible 48 is just abysmal.

Garrett has been trying to correct that, but a team which had been as weakened as the Cowboys doesnt rebuild overnight.  And hes been trying to do that on both sides of the ball.  In the 3 drafts during the Garrett era, the Cowboys drafts have been about as evenly-split as a draft could be: theyve drafted [12 offensive players and 10 defensive players](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/dal/draft.htm).  As its too early to judge the quality of those drafts, Ill avoid the temptation for now.

Point is: it takes time to replenish a teams depth.  And the Cowboys are trying.

But games like this demonstrate just how important depth is.  And how far the Cowboys still have to go.

**3)** Before I conclude my rant about depth, consider that the Cowboys had at least 6 defensive players late in the game on the field who hadnt even been on the roster at the start of the season: the 3 new guys in the backfield and the 3 guys from Walgreens in the defensive line.  Thats 6 out of 11.  This is turning into a repeat of 2012.

It would be idiotic to blame Kiffin for this debacle.  Just like it wasnt the most accurate to blame Ryan.  

Though I like the Kiffin/Marinelli combo better.  Among other things, theyve shown that they can be flexibleshifting away from the Cover 2 when it became clear it wasnt working.

Speaking of which (this is only a question, not an expression of opinion), is it too early to start describing Claiborne as a bust?

**4)** Hard to say whether the Cowboys got too conservative too early or whether they simply failed to perform.  But in the final 3 series before that last abysmal play they seemed to try too hard to run the clock down, resulting in repeated losses of yards, 2 punts, and a field goal.  However, if the offensive line simply had done its job (block), this strategy would have worked.  

It wasnt as though the Lions defense was so great.  In fact it was [28th against the pass and 23rd against the run](http://www.prideofdetroit.com/2013/10/25/5028102/detroit-lions-dallas-cowboys-on-paper-preview).  But once again the Cowboys inability to execute on offense let their opponents weak defenses off the hook.

On the one hand, a coach should know the limitations of his players.  But on the other, he should be able to expect his players to perform.  It didnt seem to be asking too much for his offensive line simply to do some run blocking.  Against the 23rd-ranked team in the NFL in run defense.

The offensive line may be better.  (Admittedly weak praise.)  But it still isnt fixed.

**5)** Once again Tanner was involved in a pivotal play in the game.  But it's hard to believe that, while explaining why [Smith's holding penalty didn't have to happen](http://espn.go.com/blog/dallas/cowboys/post/_/id/4718220/why-tyron-smiths-penalty-didnt-have-to-happen), Garrett meant to suggest that Tanner shouldn't have tried to gain a first down.  Can't blame a runner for running to daylight; and it's not Tanner's fault that Smith exercised bad technique.  Unless that play has a notation next to it in the playbook that says something like *simply run into the backs of the offensive linemen and fall down*.

Otherwise, it sounds as though Garrett's signaling that Tanner isn't long for the team.  If they had any depth at RB that is.

**6)** If you havent seen it already, you should watch [this video of Dez](http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-videos/0ap2000000271580/Dez-sideline-sound) during his supposed rant.  Not only was he not a distraction, but he was focused, analytical, and professional.  Hint: thats how you describe a leader.

**7)** Sean Lee may be the best Cowboys linebacker since [Lee Roy Jordan](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/J/JordLe00.htm).  I still say its a travesty that hes not in the Hall of Fame.  But thats how good Lee is.

**8)** Bottom line is that we should continue to expect under/inconsistent performance on both sides of the ball until:  
**(a)** Kiffin/Marinelli can work their magic on a bunch of rejects;  
**(b)** the defensive guys on whom the Cowboys expected to rely can regain their health (i.e., next year);  
**(c)** the Cowboys find a good RB who can stay on the field (see comment about next year); and  
**(d)** they can build a decent offensive line.  

In the meantime, theyll be playing on heart and the occasional flashes of brilliance between Romo, Bryant, Williams, and Witten on offense, and Lee, Carr, and Hatcher on defense.  

This is a team in development, and it still doesn't have the players yet to be a legitimate contender.  But it's gotten a lot closer.  Now it just needs to develop its depth.  Then it can learn how to win games like this one.

Which is to say its going to be an interesting and aggravating second half of the season.

<TITLE> Cowboys 31 Redskins 16: a few observations </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-10-15 12:38:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A few observations.  This is the harsh realities, or stop me if youve heard this before edition.

As always, feel free to agree/disagree.

**1)** Once again, the Cowboys may be hurt by a lack of depth.  Murray and three of the four starting defensive linemen (Spencer, Ratliff, Ware) are out for unspecified periods.  

Injuries hurt all teams, but the best teams manage to perform despite injuries.  The lesser teams are the ones which let injuries finish their seasons.  Well see which kind of team the Cowboys are.

**2)** With respect to Murray--sure, I know everybody loves him.  But, again, he is not going to be the answer.  He  performs when hes on the field, no question.  But he has missed significant playing time every year hes been in the NFL.  The best runnersSmith, Dorsett, Sanders, Paytonfound ways to stay on the field.  

Murrays style of running, in which he refuses to shy from contact, is the very thing thats hurting him.  At this point in his career, he wont change his style.  Unfortunately, that means hes going to keep getting hurt.

So far it still doesnt look like the Cowboys have a replacement for him.  Randle hasnt shown any indication he can be a go-to guy.  Though he may yet be, the game looks like its still moving too fast for him; hes not sure what hes seeing, so hes struggling to find holes.  This may change; the more snaps he gets, the more he'll see.  As always with this team, though, time will tell.

**3)** Regarding the defense, weve already seen complaints about Kiffin.  The problem is, the complaints about his schemes are as ill-informed as were the complaints about Ryan.  A coach only is as good as his players.  Ryans defense was decimated by injuries; the Cowboys are beginning to struggle with the same thing.  

By now were all becoming aware of the [no-names along the defensive line](http://www.star-telegram.com/2013/10/14/5246573/injuries-force-cowboys-to-use.html).  Can the Cowboys pressure Qbs using Drake Nevis, Caesar Rayford, David Carter, and Edgar Jones?  Again, well see.

But it would be ridiculous to blame Kiffin if they dont.

**4)** The Cowboys shifted to a man-coverage scheme against the Redskins.  Some say this was a marked improvement.  But as  I mention below, it's hard for me to agree, because the Redskins still gained a lot of yards, and they would have gained more if Griffin's passes had looked more professional.  Clearly, though, Claiborne is better at man coverage than zone.  He couldn't be much worse, though, right?

**5)** Speaking of the defense, is it too early to say that [Drake Nevis](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/N/NeviDr00.htm) is becoming one of my favorites, along with George Selvie?  Or should I wait until hes at least played a quarter of a season with the team?  But in the Redskins game that big squat body was getting some nice penetration along the line.  He looked like a massive fireplug in there.

**6)** In the absence of an effective running game, we should expect the Cowboys to become even more one-dimensional than they were in the first quarter of the season.  This wont be the fault of Callahan or Garrett.  Itll be the fault of whoever has been responsible for building depth on this team.  To keep Stauby from fussing at me again I wont say his name *coughJonescough*.

**7)** Which reminds me.  While the Cowboys drafts seem to be getting better (cant get worse than that infamous [2009 draft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_NFL_Draft)), the teams lack of depth was why so many people were howling that *coughJonescough* blew it by trading down.  Think the Cowboys couldnt use [Shariff Floyd](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/F/FloySh00/gamelog\//) now?  More than Gavin Escobar?

**8)** I had a weird sensation watching the Redskins game.  Again, the defense didnt play well (giving up 400+ yards for the fourth time this year).  And it could have been a lot worse: a number of Griffins passes to wide-open guys just looked *terrible*.  And the offense, of course, went dead in the second half after Murray left.

Like all of us, I was ecstatic at Harriss returns.  And his tackling!  Dont get me started.  And thank goodness for Nevis and Wilbur.  And I expected an offensive drop-off after that Broncos game.

But somewhere around 24-16, I found myself thinking that no matter how they looked against the Redskins, it wouldnt affect how they might look against the Eagles, the Lions, the Vikings, or any game after that.  Sure, every games a new game.  But we kid ourselves when teams are doing well that they have personalities, that we know what to expect.  

This team, though, is as inconsistent as it gets.  Lets face it, even if they win the next three, so they bring a four-game winning streak and a 6-3 record into that November 10 game against the Saints, they *still* might wind up 8-8.  

This team *almost* reminds me of the 1975 Cowboys, when [12 rookies made the team](http://www.knowyourdallascowboys.com/2009/05/30/the-greatest-draft-dirty-dozen-in-1975\/). That team went on through the Hail Mary to the great hearbreak of Super Bowl 10.  But the '75 Cowboys were *good*.  They certainly wasn't as inconsistent as this one.  It's maddening.  Interesting, but maddening.

**9)** With all of that said, two of the Cowboys' three losses have been to the only undefeated teams left in the league--by a total of four points.  So this team may be better than its record suggests.

As always, we'll see.

**1)** This was one of the most entertaining NFL games Ive ever seen.  Someone had to lose.  It happened to be the team that made the most mistakes.  Which was fitting.

**2)** To say the Cowboys lost the game because of Romo ignores the obvious and numerous other reasons the Cowboys lost, including, but not limited to:  
**a)** the defense gave up 51 points.  51!  I dont care who youre playing, if you give up 51 points youre awful;  
**b)** even after the interception, the defense failed to stop the Broncos after the Cowboys used up their timeouts; preventing the Broncos from making a first down would have given the Cowboys one more chance with about a minute left;  
**c)** Romos the only reason the Cowboys even were in the game.  Against one of the best defenses in the league, he had the best game ever by a Cowboys QB, and his 506 yards was the 12th best performance *in NFL history* by a QB;  
**d)** the OL allowed the Broncos to control the line of scrimmage on that last Cowboys sequence; the result was a sack and pressure that led to the INT.  This kind of thing happens to *any* team that loses control of the line of scrimmage;
 
**3)** If Romo had thrown that INT in the first quarter, no one even would remember it.  The timing of the INT, though, will add fuel to the perception that Romo chokes in the clutch.

The problem with this concept is that the clutch doesnt exist.  Which is to say, its a misperception arising from our own emotional involvement in a game, based on what weve seen so far.

Said another way, every other play matters just as much as the purportedly clutch play, as every other play has led to the moment of the clutch.  

In baseball, SABR has proven that there is [no such thing as a clutch hitter](http://research.sabr.org/journals/do-clutch-hitters-exist).  Instead, it famously has concluded that *most . . . of the differences among player's PWA's (i.e., player win average, or clutch hitting) are really attributable to differences in the quantity of their hits, not to differences in the timeliness of their hits.*  This means that a players performance the rest of the time matters every bit as much as his purportedly clutch performance, *because his team wouldn't have gotten to that point otherwise*.

Sound familiar?  

That INT hurt us because we imagined the Cowboys marching down the field and winning, given what wed seen already (and what Romo already had done).  But what hed done was play incrediblyso incredibly, in fact, that they still were in the game at that point, notwithstanding the atrocious performance by the Cowboys defense.  Said another way: every sensational play Romo made (and there were many) were clutch perfomances.

If Romo can be accused fairly of anything, its that hes unable to carry a team on his back to the point where it can overcome his occasional mistake.  But no player in any team sport ever has been able to do that, based on the very definition of team sport.  The outcome of a game in a team sport is based on the performances of every member of the two teams involved.  As mentioned in (1), a lot of other players let the Cowboys down a lot more than did Romo.

The media focuses on Romo the same reason it focuses on celebrity: its easy to write about one guy, particularly under deadline pressure, and doesnt require significant analysis.  Its easier to focus on his fumbled snap of a PAT than on all the other mistakes in that playoff game; its easier to blame him for that choke in the Lions game than on all the bad routes receivers ran/truly excellent plays made by the Lions; etc.

Just as easy (and accurate) to blame the OL for that INT as Romo; it didnt give him time to do what hed amply demonstrated he could do.  And Escobar wasnt in the proper position for the pass.  Which isnt to displace blame; obviously Romos the one who threw it.  But he wasnt the *sole* reason the INT happened or that the Cowboys lost.

**Edit**: in fact, check [this link](http://www.bloggingtheboys.com/2013/10/7/4811472/cowboys-broncos-deciphering-the-decision-tony-romo-interception), showing exactly why the INT happened.  And it was not because of Romo.  Ach!  I'm so brilliant.

**4)** I continue to appreciate the extent to which Bryant has changed his life; his performance on the field is simply a demonstration of his commitment to seizing the opportunity before him.  Many people never reach the point in life where all they ever wanted was right in front of them, and all they had to do was work to take it.  Hes come from a terrible background and hes reached that point.  Looks to me like hes made the right decision.  

He's becoming a man right before our eyes.  Not because he can catch a ball.  But because he's learned to maximize his abilities and his opportunity.  That makes it easy to cheer for him now.

**5)** FYI the Cowboys could have run at the end; in retrospect, it would have been preferable to what happened.  But coaches cant coach in retrospect.  Romo was lights-out; no coach in his right mind would have gone away from what was working so tremendously.

**6)** I love the sudden revelation of the long game.  Id like to see a lot more of that.

**7)** Terrance Williams is starting to look like the real deal, huh?  Anyone who watched him at Baylor could have told us that.

**8)** All day, the Broncos looked like the better teamin fact, they looked like the best team in the NFL.  Amazing that the Cowboys almost won that game.  The difficulty lies in drawing conclusions from the loss.  I remember reading a few years back that most NFL games are decided by less than a TD.  Point is that teams are roughly equivalent; this is why we say things like any given Sunday.  Almost always in the NFL teams beat themselves.  Its what happened in this game.  But the Broncos still looked terrific.  Big fast guys everywhere.

Every game is its own universe.  I would have been euphoric if the Cowboys had won.  But my attitude about the team actually wouldnt have been that different.

The effort the Cowboys demonstrated was night and day better than in that [Packers debacle](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201011070gnb.htm).  And this Broncos team is better than that Packers team.

Notwithstanding whatever mistakes he still may make (and believe me, Landry made *many* (or at least he was accused of it)), this is what Garrett has brought to the Cowboys: a change in attitude.  It is being demonstrated on the field; its just not showing up in the W/L columns yet.  Remember, though: teams *always* are works in progress, either up or down.  Teams do not turn around overnight.  This team is not going sideways at all.

Sure, the Cowboys have been a [sub-.500 team since 1997](http://espn.go.com/dallas/nfl/story/_/id/9784140/dallas-cowboys-continue-find-creative-ways-lose?ex_cid=espnapi_public).  But to say that nothing has changed is just idiotic.  This group of Cowboys isnt responsible for Campos ineptitude, the personality disputes between Jones and every head coach hed ever hired until Garrett, Jones inability to evaluate talent.

This is a new group that has changed dramatically since Garrett became head coach.  It is trending up.  But as anyone familiar with trends understands, trends represent measurement of general direction, not specific performance.  There will be a lot of games like that Chargers' bomb and a lot of heartwrenching losses before they figure it out.

Question we'll have to wait to see answered is if they'll ever figure it out.

It will take patience and time for it to succeed.  But Garrett is building something.  All the best coachesLandry, Lombardi, Gibbs, [Noll](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/coaches/NollCh0.htm)understood that success is built primarily on a change in attitude.  This team has a different attitude than any Ive seen on the Cowboys since the early 90s.

I wouldnt be surprised at all if this game changed their season.  Time will tell, of course.  It always does.  While the team is improving, it's not at a championship level yet (or even genuine contender yet).  Right now it's 2-3, inconsistent in many respects, beating itself as often as being outplayed.  But it's not quitting.  And if it can show the hunger it demonstrated in this game, it could be on the verge of breaking out.

**9)** Let me repeat it: more long passes please!

<TITLE> Thunderbird problem (help?) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-10-03 02:19:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm using Thunderbird 17.0.8.  For about a year (i.e., stretching back through previous versions), Thunderbird has been having problems with emails either past a certain size or which contain HTML (or both--I'm not really sure which).  When it tries to download one of these emails, I get different error messages, along the lines of:

*The RETR command did not succeed.  Error retrieving a message.  Mail server localhost responded:*

(and then it provides a variety of messages which themselves seem garbled, such as (this is not the only one) "etica, sans-serif; color: #ffffffff, font-size: 13px; border-bottom: 1=").

Another sample error message: "The DELE command did not succeed. Error marking a message as deleted. Mail server localhost responded:"

Ultimately, if I keep pressing ctrl+F5, the message downloads, but it's garbled or truncated.  I think it has something to do with a chunk size maybe?  Maybe something to do with a fetch by chunk option?  I'd read that by increasing that option in the config file this problem would resolve.  So I tried it, but couldn't find that option in the config file.  I wound up adding it manually, but it had no effect.  

So that made me think the chunk issue only was relevant to an older version.  Even so, it does seem that something about the way Thunderbird is configured to download emails is interfering with their delivery.  I'm just not sure what.

I've also tried compressing the file folders; no effect.

I realize we're in a small sub, and I'm not being very clear.  But as you can see I'm not sure even how to describe the problem.

If I have to uninstall/reinstall Thunderbird, I'd want to save my email files, as they go back years.

I appreciate any help anyone might provide. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Chargers game: pass v run (warning: long) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-10-02 15:46:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After seeing all the squawks about the Cowboys' purported failure to run the ball enough in the Chargers game, I decided to examine the play by play to see if there were any merit to that idea.  I'm always on the lookout for biases that might skew my opinion of the state of the Cowboys, so I figured this was worth doing, as I might learn something.

[My source](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201309290sdg.htm#pbp_data::none).

**First possession, 1st Q, 0-0**

On 1st down Murray gained 10 yards, earning another 1st down.  

Romo then was sacked for -4, setting up a 2nd and 14.  With regard to that play, while the Cowboys could have run again, there's nothing inherently wrong in occasionally passing on first down.  So that early in the game, it's not a bad call.  

The result was bad, because running on 2nd and 14 probably isn't the smartest.  2nd down was an incompletion.  Not many people credibly will suggest running on 3rd and 14.  So that series was a bust because of the sack, which, sure, wouldn't have happened if the Cowboys had tried to run, but as already discussed, running then passing is called mixing it up.

**Second possession, 1st Q, 0-0**

Two runs gave the Cowboys 3rd and 2.  On 3rd down, they could have run, sure.  They also could have passed.  This one I'll call a wash, leaning toward the idea that they should have run, but recognizing that the call could have gone either way.

**Third possession, 1st Q, 0-7**

On 1st, pass incomplete.  On 2nd, pass for 7.  3rd and 3.  Result's okay as of this point.  Sure, they could have run.  But 3rd and short isn't bad.  Then a sack.  Okay, there could have been some runs, but this isn't terrible playcalling.  It's just starting to shift toward an imbalance.

**Fourth possession, 1st/2nd Q, 0-7**

9 plays, 3 runs, 6 passes.  The runs averaged 4.67; the passes averaged 7.167.  The Cowboys ran for 6, then passed for 5, passed for 10, passed for 10, passed for 13.  Then they ran for 2 on 1st as a penalty gave them another 1st.  Pass for 13, run for 6, then the pass to Bryant for the TD.

They averaged 2nd and short after each 1st down pass.  They averaged 2nd and middle to long after each 1st down run.  To me, the results shift the balance back to neutral. 

6 runs, 13 passes as of this point.  32 yards on 6 runs (5.33),  51 yards on 13 passes (3.92).  On sheer numbers, run seems more effective; however, discounting Romo's early 0-4, pass plays were averaging 5.67.  The sacks hurt more than the playcalling.  But the Cowboys could have run the ball a bit more, arguably with roughly equivalent results.

**Fifth possession, 2nd Q, 7-7**

1st down, a run for no gain.  2nd and 10.  They're supposed to run on 2nd and 10?  Sure they could have.  It may have gained about what their pass did (4 yards).  On 3rd and 6 there aren't many teams that will run.  The Cowboys passed incomplete.  This is when Bailey tried the long field goal.

With respect to that call, the Cowboys were on the Chargers 38.  They could have punted, but something I havent seen discussed here is that Jones isnt so great at pinning guys inside the 10.  This is anecdotal until I can find hard evidence, but I read somewhere that hes middle of the pack when it comes to that.  

So the choice was between letting the Chargers start at their 20 or letting them start at their 46.  So far, the defense had looked pretty goodthe Chargers had gained a total of 108 yards through a quarter and a half.  That projects to under 300 for the game.

Conservative call would have been to punt.  But pretty much all of us think Baileys a terrific kicker.  This is the kind of call you criticize or praise in retrospect, depending on results.  Unfortunately coaches cant coach in retrospect.

**Fifth possession, 2nd Q, 7-10**

1st down pass to Bryant for 14.  Sure they could've run, but subbies seem to love whenever the ball is thrown to Bryant.  And the Cowboys didn't have a 14 yard run all day.  Three runs gained 24 yards.  Then the 34 yard pass to Bryant for the TD at 2:44 mark.

**Sixth possession, 3rd Q 9:32, 21-20**

A lot happened here between possessions.  Sean Lees interception and Rivers switch to short drops were the most important.

As an aside, I would argue that Rivers switch just before halftime affected this game far more than the Cowboys playcalling, as it ended any inability by the Cowboys to pressure him.  It seemed like pass after pass was just a little loop or flare out of the backfield.  It should be noted that the Chargers ran 14 passes to 3 runs on two drives while scoring 10 points.  

In any event, on 1st Murray ran for 3.  A penalty gave them 2nd and 12.  Im sorry, but almost no team runs on 2nd and 12.  A pass gave them 3rd and 3.  A pass gave them 5 and a 1st down.

As this point, as others have mentioned, the Cowboys tendency to pass on 3rd and short seems a lot more obvious than that a run/pass imbalance overall is hurting them.  Said another way, if an imbalance is hurting them, its on 3rd and short. 

On 1st, Murray ran for 4 and a penalty gave them 15.  On 1st Murray lost 1.  Again the Cowboys faced 2nd and long (10+).  This was the 4th time in the game the Cowboys faced 2nd and long.  2 of those happened after runs on first down.  1 happened after a penalty, and 1 after a pass.  

Observation: the Cowboys passing on 1st down was not forcing them into 2nd and long as much as the Cowboys running on first down.  

Teams rarely run on 2nd and 11.  This doesnt suggest that they should; it suggests that they dont because *it rarely helps*.  If theyd tried to run on that play, they would have been criticized for it.

Anyway, two incompletions, including Bryants inability to hold the ball on the sideline, ended the possession at 6:18.

Note: if Bryant had caught that pass, theyd have had a 1st down.

**Seventh possession, 4th Q, 14:41, 21-23**

By now its become obvious that the Cowboys didnt adjust on defense to those short passes.  They also had numerous blown coverages (though the killer of course came after this).  In short, the Chargers were beating the defense by offsetting the Cowboys rush with short drops and utilizing short routes to find holes in the zones.  Heres a [search](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+beat+the+cover+2) where you can see for yourself that finding holes in zones is how you beat the Cover 2.  Didn't help that Claiborne seemed to forget how to cover people.

I'm beginning to wonder if maybe he's not an ideal CB for a Cover-2.  Supposedly he's got all the skills, but his technique looks bad to me.  His footwork seems to get his body out of position on a lot of plays.  Also, I remember at least 2 penalties (not just in this game) on him that didn't seem justified.  So he needs to control his body more to stop the completions and to stop making refs think he's fouling players.

In any event, on 1st they ran for 9, then passed for 6.  On 1st, they ran for 6.  Then they passed for 10, 6, and 6.  On that 3rd pass, a penalty on Leary, not the pass, hurt them.  The penalty pushed them into their 5th 2nd and long (here 2nd and 14).  

They passed for 6.  Arguably if theyre going to pass for 6 they might as well try to run for 6.  But trying to use this one call to argue that the Cowboys didnt run enough seems weak.  

On 3rd down they passed.  It was expected but it also was rational, as the Cowboys werent averaging 6 per carry, and they *were* averaging 6+ per pass.  

Anyway, this was the play where Witten dropped the ball; it looked to me like it hit his shoulder pads.  He almost always makes this catch; heck, hes built his career on this catch.  If hed caught it, theyd have had a huge first down.  He was in perfect position and the ball was on target.  But he dropped it.

**Eighth possession, 4th Q, 6:69, 21-30**

Sorry to anyone who says they didnt have to pass by now, but down by 2 scores, in light of their defenses vulnerability, it was time to pass.  2 passes gained a first down.  A 3rd pass to Murray gained 1.  But the killer here was the penalty on Parnell, which forced them into 1st and 20.  

No one sensible is going to suggest they should have run on this play.  

Sure, maybe they should have run on that 1 yard pass to Murray, but it wouldnt have mattered what they called there, due to Parnells penalty.  Sure, it was holding, which almost never gets called on running plays.  But come on: someones going to argue that the Cowboys should have run because an OL was called for holding?  Thats Monday-morning quarterbacking at its *worst*.

Anyway, they passed the rest of the way, leading up to Williamss fumble.

People will say they shouldnt have gone to Williams, the *rookie*, when they had Bryant.  But Williams was having a decent day (his best so far).  And if Bryant was such a go-to, why the heck didnt he get open more often?  After all (supposedly), the Cowboys passed way too much today.  Bryants a 4th year man, who supposedly is a beast.  So why hasnt he learned to break double coverages yet?

I don't want to diss Bryant, who's shown marked growth and maturity.

My point: Williams made a mistake, but the pass to him was not a mistake.  He should have tucked that ball in and relied on the next play.  But he was trying to make a play.  In 40+ years of watching the Cowboys, Ive seen that good players learn from that kind of mistake.  Bad players repeat it.  Well see which kind Williams is.

**Ninth possession, 4th Q, 1:02, 21-30**

Short passes to the left and middle, ending in a fumble.

If someone wants to complain about the Cowboys passing game, heres where Id raise a point: Romo never, *ever*, has been good in 2-minute mode.  He always takes too long to make reads/call plays, and far too often the passes are short and/or to the middle of the field.  This goes back his entire career.  Could be because the Cowboys have lacked the receivers to get open on long sideline routes.  I realize this is sacrilege, as seemingly everyone except me thinks they have such great star power at receiver.

But this doesnt have anything to do with the run v. pass argument.

**Conclusions (a kind of TLDR)**

The Cowboys didnt lose this game because they failed to run enough or because of playcalling.  They lost because:

1) they faced too many 2nd and longs, almost always because of mistakes by the OL (sacks, penalties);

2) they werent able to adjust to Rivers short drops, which eliminated any pressure and allowed the Chargers to take advantage of an inherent weakness in the Cover 2;

3) at key moments, drops by Bryant and Witten, and Williams fumble.

In short, this was a team loss.  It wasnt because they didnt run enough.

<TITLE> Cowboys 31 Rams 7: a few observations </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-09-23 12:40:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As always, feel free to agree/disagree.  Please just be polite.  And explain your reasoning!

**1)** A good day to be a Cowboys fan!  They played well and actually looked good.  It's been a while.  Plus all the other NFC East teams lost!  Let's savor this feeling.

**2)**   The Cowboys found a running game two ways: (a) by running Murray through/off the tackles, and (b) by blocking.  However, it probably would be a mistake to expect him to play like this every week.  

Coming into the game, the Rams had [one of the worst-ranked defenses in the NFL](http://www.stltoday.com/sports/football/professional/rams-pass-defense-gets-another-big-test/article_8e2090cd-a86c-582d-938d-5df3a3b27028.html) and they clearly expected the Cowboys to pass.  When they changed their scheme late in the game (long after it was too late), they stopped the run.  And now that the Cowboys showed how they could run, defenses will know how to plan.  Then it will become a question of which team executes.

At the very least, that the Cowboys demonstrated that they can run will give defenses something else to think about.  Which is a good thing.

In any event, by running Murray outside, the Cowboys freed him from having to rely on his vision and having to make the directional decisions that had caused him so much trouble the first two weeks.  Freed from having to cut significantly, he was able simply to enter the holes and run.  This plan worked because of (b).  The holes the OL gave him often were *big*. 

Quite a few times he tried to juke, doing little wiggles, and the defenders absolutely did not fall for it.  He also started trying to change direction by spinning.  

I also noticed that guys had a lot of trouble trying to tackle him high, whereas the low tackles brought him down somewhat easily.

Still, he played well, taking what the OL gave him.  

Interesting that his two biggest rushing days have been against the Rams.

**3)** Speaking of the OL, it might be time to stop thinking of it as a weakness.  I'm not ready to call it a strength yet, but even against the Chiefs it pass-protected well.  In that regard, we've seen all season that Romo has had time to throw.  It's possible, if the Cowboys continue trying to run Murray outside, that they may be able to run-block, too.

Looks like Callahan's efforts--and the rotating door on the line--finally may have resolved the biggest problem on the team.  Consider: when was the last time we heard Doug Free's name called?

**4)** Is it too early to start considering George Selvie as defensive rookie of the year?  Yeah, yeah, I jest (maybe).  It's not like defensive linemen [never win](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award).  Unlike their counterparts on the OL (poor overlooked fellers).

Edit: as Greg604246 points out below, Selvie's a 4-year vet.  So it's not too early at all.  It's too late!

**5)** As a digression, check out how many of the great Cowboys' defensive players have won ROTY!  That's right: *none*.  Not even Thomas "Hollywood" Henderson, who had an excellent rookie year.  So he lost out to Robert Brazile, who became a [7-time Pro Bowler and 5-time All Pro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Brazile), while Henderson was out of the NFL by 1981, due chiefly to [problems with cocaine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Henderson_(American_football\)).  He also won the Lotto Texas in 2000, so maybe at last he's found peace.  

**6)** I like Ware *much better* as a lineman.  His speed, moves, and strength let him do what he does best.

**7)** As much as I hate to say it, I have to say it: Austin's hamstring.  I actually thought of it shortly before he left the game.  On one of his two catches, he was tackled by a guy who was riding his back.  I thought, "Geez, that can't be good for his hamstrings".  Sure enough.

Listen, he was a bright spot for us for a couple of years when we didn't have many bright spots.  But once a guy's hamstrings start to go, they go.  I'm hoping he's not hurt too badly, but I fear that the rest of his career will be like this.

**8)** I cannot be the only one who, near the end of the game, actually wanted the team to pass.

**9)** Maybe it was obvious to everyone else, but for the first time yesterday I actually considered that maybe the Cowboys drafted Escobar as an eventual replacement for Witten.  Hey, I don't remember Bennett ever looking that smooth on any TD reception.

Given that Bennett only ever scored [4 TDs](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BennMa00.htm) for the Cowboys, and none in his last 3 years with the team, maybe that's why.

**10)** Funny to see Witten in the backfield; he's always blocked better than any FB anyway.

**11)** Dez Bryant has 17 catches for 201 yards.  He won't hit 2,000.  But he's on pace to gain 1,000 yards, and with a big game here or there he may blow through that.  As long as he keeps working hard on every play, that'll be good enough for me.

**12)** I know, I know--every time Jones speaks he weakens the nation.  But he may have been somewhat accurate when he said that he didn't remember the Cowboys ever playing better defense.  Maybe he only meant since Johnson left.  (Those 90s defenses were *fast*.)

But since Johnson left, I might agree.  And that includes the 2 shut-outs at the end of [2009](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/dal/2009.htm).  

Maybe it's been so long since I saw a good defensive game that I've simply forgotten what one looked like.  

I like the swarming tackles though.  Makes me wonder why every coordinator doesn't emphasize that.  

But let's not get ahead of ourselves.  Play with some of the categories at [NFL.com](http://www.nfl.com/stats/categorystats?tabSeq=2 defensiveStatisticCategory=GAME_STATS conference=ALL role=OPP season=2013 seasonType=REG d-447263-s=TOTAL_YARDS_GAME_AVG d-447263-o=1 d-447263-n=1) and you'll see they're still middle of the pack in almost every category.  11th in total points, 14th in Yds/G, 19th in Yds/P (yike!), 5th in 3rd-down percentage (oh-ho!  maybe that's why they're looking so good).  

They are definitely headed in the right direction, though.

Still, a real test for that defense comes in two weeks.

<TITLE> Chiefs 17 Cowboys 16: a few observations </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-09-16 12:25:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As usual, a few observations after the latest ~~debacle~~ game.  Feel free to agree/disagree; please just explain your reasoning.  

And try to be respectful.  As though you're talking to friends.  Because, hey!  Guess what!  Maybe you are.

1) The Cowboys beat themselves.  And they did it long before the two turnovers; they did it when they settled for a field goal when they were up 10-7.  Maybe when they settled for 7-3.  

2) On a related note, the Cowboys still haven't figured out how to reach the end zone.  So far they've scored 3 TDs and 5 field goals (not including the 2 TDs by the defense).  As Brad Schamm used to say, a field goal is a waste of 4 points.  So they've left at least 20 points on the field.  Good teams score TDs.

And no, I'm not suggesting that the offense is bad (though it still seems to be a work in progress).  It's just not *efficient*.

When the defense scores almost as many TDs as the offense, there's an issue.

And don't look now, but the Cowboys have been outscored in the second half in both games.

3) I'm surprised/impressed by the OL.  Though Frederick at times looked like a rookie against the Chiefs.  And it seems to be wearing down at the end, suggesting that there's an issue with conditioning.  Which isn't surprising, given the new faces.

4) This week, the defense played better than the offense.  Which should make up for last week, in which the reverse was true.  But it wasn't able to make the big stop when the game was on the line--instead drawing a pass interference penalty on the play that would've stopped the Chiefs' drive at the end.  And as [Apefist said](http://www.reddit.com/r/cowboys/comments/1m9kdr/the_turnovers_were_nice_and_all_but_the_cowboys/cc8d31g) right here, just last week: *live by the turnover, die by them*.  -2 turnover ratio = (far too often) a loss.

5) I am heartened by Dez Bryant.  Not because he's living up to his talent, but because *he's living up to himself*.  At my age, after what I was lucky enough to overcome in my own life, I have come to appreciate when others can overcome incredible adversity.  Bryant's play on the field is a direct result of his effort and focus in practice, and *that* is a result of his maturity and recognition that he's reached the point toward which he's fought his entire life.

Bryant's chance to pull himself out of the hole in which his background dropped him at birth is now.  And he's doing what he must to climb out.  Bravo for him!

Makes it easy to root for him.  And not because he wears a star.

6)  Re Bryant: I loved that diving catch.  And obviously he didn't commit pass interference.  And sure the game would've been entirely different but for that blown call.  But Bryant still has to learn how to fight off double coverage.  The Chiefs shut him down in the second half.  And the great receivers don't let that happen.

7) I'm going to keep saying it.  Over and over.  Because I was derided when I kept denying that Garrett's playcalling was the problem.  But it should be clear now to everyone that execution, not the playcalling, was and is the problem.

But for people who still insist it was the OC, sure, I'll instigate. Callahan's playcalling so far doesn't seem to be an improvement.  A sequence which didn't look like check-downs near the end, when Romo kept throwing to Witten in the flat, was downright awful.

And what was with that last play?

Good teams actually try to throw the ball down the field with 16 seconds left.  Could you imagine the Broncos, Packers, or Patriots calling that little dump to Murray?  

8) Witten has been so used to being ignored; in the past, he just could turn around and catch the ball.  But on one of those plays near the end, I remember thinking that he should've moved toward the ball.  I guess even a future Hall of Famer can have a bad play occasionally.  

That Austin failed to do it too didn't surprise me so much.

9) George Selvie reminds me of Harvey Martin.  What made Martin so excellent was that he never quit.  Selvie's like that.  I admire those who refuse to let anyone else outwork them.  It's one reason why Witten's been my favorite Cowboy for a long time.  But if Selvie continues what he's doing, he'll move right up that list.

His story of course is outstanding: unemployed, hoping for work.  He sounds like a vast number of Americans today.  What's not to root for?

10) Fans who've been waiting for Murray to give the Cowboys a running game (which includes, I guess, basically everyone) should skip this paragraph, because they're not going to like it.

But mark my words: Murray isn't the answer.  He runs like Herschel Walker, a tremendously gifted athlete who had, by all accounts, an astounding fitness routine (famously saying, at 50, that he still did [1,500 push-ups and 2,000 sit-ups each day](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/10/11/herschel.fitness.martial.arts/index.html)).  Heck, I'm in that age range, and if I can sit up out of bed it's a miracle.  

But Walker ran like a cannonball--that is, straight ahead.  If he'd cut it would have broken his ankles.  He lacked ferocity, though.  Unlike, say, Marion Barber III.  And he'd stop when people hit him.  

Yep, that was Walker: a Nerf cannonball.  However, he, too, was easy to tackle by the ankle, as is Murray.

Go back and look at the video (if you can stomach it) and compare Murray's running to Dunbar's (before the fumble).  Dunbar actually *cut*.  Murray, in contrast, tended to run right at the back of guys, even if gaping holes were on either side.  Last year he made some nice cuts, which was one of the reasons why I praised him over Jones.  But this year he hasn't.  Not sure why.

The greatest runners--Sanders, Dickerson, Dorsett, Payton--weren't just fast, but could use a defender's momentum against him.  Murray hasn't.

I realize I didn't include Smith in that list.  We can talk about why another time.  But probably we all know why.  Which isn't to question his toughness at all.  Smith had a tremendous hunger to succeed.

In any event, there's a reason why we've heard the phrase: *run to daylight*.

11) Jason Garrett in a [nutshell](http://espn.go.com/blog/dallas/cowboys/post/_/id/4714983/cowboys-looking-like-the-same-team-as-always): 

*"We just have to go back to work," Garrett said on being 1-1. "We don't really say anything to anyone who says anything about us. We'll evaluate what happened to us in all three phases of our football team and try to get better."*

12) As I've said before, the Cowboys are headed in the right direction.  But assuming Jones leaves Garrett alone, they're still at least a year away from being a genuinely good team.  Someone wrote last week: you can't question their top 10.  But it's everyone after that who's a question mark.

That said, it's not so hard now to get a sense of who they are.  At best they'll be 3-2 after the Broncos game, 5-3 at midseason.  *At best*.  

I'm afraid we're looking at another 8-8 year.  Anything better than that would demonstrate that they're growing ahead of schedule.  It would give us reasons for hope, like when they went 5-3 after Phillips was fired.

But teams can improve over the course of a season.  And they remain extremely competitive.  And they are, of course, ~~excrutiating~~ *interesting* to watch.

<TITLE> Cowboys 36 Giants 31: a few observations </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-09-09 12:22:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As usual, a few observations about the latest game.  Feel free to agree/disagree.  Please just explain your reasoning.

(1) The Cowboys won.  Everything else is secondary to this.

(2) Six turnovers!  Six!  Nowhere close to the record for a single game, [which is 12](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_National_Football_League_records_(team\)#Turnovers).  Still, in one game the Cowboys gained 37.5% of the total number of turnovers they recovered all last season.  It was the most turnovers recovered by the Cowboys since [December 14, 2003](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200312140was.htm).

(3) Despite the turnovers, not all of which were due to the defense, the Cowboys' defense looked *awful*.  In particular the corners were burned repeatedly and often.  Big play after big play kept the Giants in the game.  Doesn't bode well.

(4) I like George Selvie!  And that other guy--Hayden.  The defensive line played hard and seemed to pressure Manning a lot.

(5) Can I laugh now at all the fans who criticized Garrett the OC for passing too often?  By halftime--*halftime*--Romo had thrown 33 times.  He finished with 49 attempts.  How long before we start hearing that Callahan should be replaced as OC?

The simple reality is that the game has changed.  This now is a passing league.

And the Cowboys lack an explosive runner.  And with the OL still a work in progress, the Cowboys *have* to pass if they want to move the ball.  Last year's debacle had as much to do with Garrett's playcalling as last night's 49 pass attempts had to do with Garrett's playcalling.

Murray is not the answer, and if he keeps trying to run over guys, his career will be short.  Consider [Marion Barber, III](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BarbMa01.htm).  More importantly, consider [Earl Campbell](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/C/CampEa00.htm), the most fearsome runner I ever saw, who only recently made news for [leaving a wheelchair for the first time in years](http://www.ktrh.com/articles/houston-news-121300/legendary-oiler-earl-campbell-is-out-11112906/).

(6) With respect to the OL, for the most part it seemed to play pretty well.  Romo had a ton of time on a number of plays.  I particularly liked, though, seeing Frederick help up the ball carriers over and over.  Then I started noticing other linemen doing it.  I'm guessing Waters will play well. Surprisingly, barring injury, the OL  may become a strength of the team.

(7) Guess we'll have to wait another week for Dez Bryant's assault on 2000 yards.  It shouldn't be news to anyone that Bryant will face double/triple teams all year.  He may be lucky to reach 1200 yards (which still would be an excellent season).

(8) Was anyone else surprised that Romo didn't go to Witten on that 2-point conversion?  Maybe simpler: was anyone not surprised when he didn't?

(9) Speaking of Bryant, I noticed that he was back to his old way of not making plays and then begging for penalties.  Listen: whether he actually was penalized isn't the point.  Jerry Rice, Lynn Swann, the true greats made plays despite the penalties.  Let's hope someone tells Bryant that.

(10) Dwayne Harris played great on special teams.  Second coming of Bill Bates!  Well, maybe it's a little early for that.  

(11) Everyone see that guy who was knocked on his butt by the Giants' defender?  It was late so I wasn't paying close attention to the players involved, but it was a heck of a hit.

(12) It was another entertaining game.  As long as Garrett keeps them interesting, I'll enjoy watching them play.

(13) FYI the Chiefs are not going to be an easy game.  Reid had them playing hard in the preseason, and they blew through a bad Jags team.  Alex Smith looks like the real deal, and the defense looks solid.
If the offense plays as inefficiently as it did against the Giants, the Cowboys may be looking at 1-1.

<TEXT> Hopefully this won't get downvoted; we're really trying to figure out what to do for our son.

We found out today that our 7 year old got into the gifted and talented program for the second grade in Park Slope. We don't know anything about it other than its name (pretty much). He's currently in a Montessori program, where he's done well, but we're worried that the school's resources are somewhat limited and its class sizes are not big.

We could use any info we could get about the Gifted   Talented program's curriculum, how successful it is about preparing kids for middle school/high school, the responsiveness of teachers, class sizes, homework, etc.

Currently our plan is to try to get our son into the Mark Twain middle school, and from there one of the technical high schools.

Thank you for any info/help you can provide.

<TEXT> As we approach the last week before the start of the season, I thought I'd offer up a few observations.  If its too long, feel free to skip it.  Nothing you couldn't have seen for yourself.

Otherwise, though, definitely feel free to agree/disagree--but explain why!  Just don't downvote anyone's (relevant) comments, as all observations are equally valid until the season starts (yep I borrowed that from the [uncertainty principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle)).

In no particular order:

**1)** The Tampa 2 notoriously is a bend/don't break defense.  This is because of its ability to create turnovers and the contraction of the defensive backfield as the other team approaches the end zone.

With respect to turnovers, I've always loved when the Cowboys have gotten them.  They really do stop the other team dead in its tracks, thus interfering with its process.  It's easily understandable why they correlate more than any other discovered factor to wins.

I'm not so sure, though, whether fumbles (as opposed to interceptions) should be attributed to the Tampa 2 as much as the coaching.  On the one hand, the Tampa 2's emphasis on gang tackling encourages them, as, while one guy holds the ball carrier up, other defenders work him over.  But based on what I've seen, the Cowboys this year are *tackling* differently.  Instead of going for head/shoulders (which guys never should do) or legs, they seem to be going for the *ball*.  This is leading to all those fumbles.

It makes sense, as if the defender hits the ball first instead of the body, that ball's going to come out more often than not.  Anyone remember the scene with Jeff Bridges and Rosie Perez in the excellent moive [Fearless](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fearless_%281993_film%29)?  I recommend the movie highly (though it's kind of a downer).  In it, Bridges' character, the survivor of a commercial airliner crash, demonstrates to Perez's character why there was no way she could have saved her baby, Bubbles, whom she was holding in her arms.  I won't say how he does this, so as not to spoil the moment, but the concept is the same.

It's possible this is a part of the defense, with its emphasis on gang tangling.  But I don't see why almost every defense couldn't teach this technique.  Still, whatever the reason, I've loved the defense's ability to create turnovers.  

Also, I'm not sure the Cowboys have gotten so many turnovers because the other teams haven't been very good.  The Bengals were a playoff team.  The Texans will be a real test.

**2)** In the past, I've been a very critical observer of Dez Bryant, saying that he hadn't demonstrated maturity on or off the field, that potential counts for nothing (remember that great line in the Pogues' song [Fairytale of New York](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwHyuraau4Q) "I could have been someone/well so could anyone"?).  But the absence of news stories suggests that he really has figured out that this is his chance, his one opportunity to overcome his life--and if he's embraced that concept, I overwhelmingly cheer for and support him, as one person to another.

On the field, he has dominated every game when he's been in.  He appears to be uncoverable, and there's only been one other receiver I'd ever thought that about.  His name is Jerry Rice.  His on-field performance has demonstrated his emphasis on taking advantage of the chance he's got.  If he takes advantage of that, he'll be a Hall of Famer.

**3)** The OL still looks pretty bad.  Yeah, yeah, injuries.  But they had injuries last year too.  And the year before that.  Every team has injuries.  That's why the best teams build up quality depth.  Still doesn't look like the Cowboys have it.  Maybe it's an issue of first teamers v. everyone else.  But it's been hard to tell who the first-teamers are because of the injuries.  This will be an ongoing question as the season progresses.

**4)** Alex Tanney looks at least as good as Kyle Orton *right now*.  Almost every single pass has been dead on the money and delivered with touch.  I don't remember which play it was, but on one, he just floated it over a guy right to the receiver (Benford, I think).  His ability to adjust his passes puts him way ahead of Vinny Testaverde, another strong-armed gunner.  And Testaverde had a [20 year career](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/T/TestVi00.htm).  His biggest drawback was too stong a reliance on his arm, combined with an inability to adjust his passes, which caused him to force too many, which led to all those interceptions.

Tanney, in contrast, has demonstrated that touch.  I don't know what he's doing that's not making coaches see how special he may become.  Whatever it is seems to be stopping his career.  But he seems to me to be the real deal.

That doesn't mean he doesn't have things to learn.  He's not paying enough attention to the pocket, and that's leading to some ugly sacks.  Of course though to some extent that's on the OL.  See #3.

Everyone praises Orton as a backup QB.  But, as long as it doesn't cause dissention, I'd rather have 2 guys I'd want running my team as QBs, even if one is in development, instead of a "starter" and a "backup".

I like Tanney, and I think he could be not just a starter, but a quality starter, in the NFL.

**5)** Though I could make more, this will be my last observation, as the post is too long already.  

The defense is averaging 17.25 points a game so far.  Sure it's preseason, a lot of it's been against the Dolphins/Raiders, etc.  But even if the Bengals aren't on the level of the Pats/49ers, they're still a good team.  And they only scored 18.

But injuries are what decimated the Cowboys last year.  So we'll see what happens this year.

The offense may be better, due almost entirely to Bryant/Frederick.  But the Cowboys only will go as far as injuries/the OL lets them go.

I'm not sure any success will be sustainable yet.  This team still seems to be one good draft away. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [TOMT] [Editorial cartoon] demonstrating how much could be bought for $1 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-08-23 17:28:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I realize this isn't a typical TOMT request, but the mods suggested I post it, so here goes.

Some years back, in a book of Americana, I saw an editorial cartoon, which even then must have been old, depicting a little boy in a shopkeeper's store, perhaps around the turn of the 20th century.  The little boy had $1, and he was listing all the items he was supposed to buy with the money.  I don't remember what all they were anymore, but they probably included household items like flour, eggs, sugar, cloth, seed, etc.

At the end of the list, the little boy said something like, "And mama says with the change left over I can buy some candy".

I'm trying to find that cartoon again, but the name of the book it was in would be even better.  I don't remember much about it.  It was hardback and had a lot of different articles, including (probably) stories about Custer, native Americans (called Indians back then), and, well, I just don't remember what all.

Anyhow, this is like an advanced TOMT challenge.  So thank you for any info you can provide!   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I received this message today. Words fail.

The only editing I did was to include the link (which he had included but couldn't be copy/pasted here) for context.

The message I received:

Hi, you might not remember me but my name is Scott. About a year ago I posted to /r/atheism about how I was considering committing suicide. [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/rr0bl/im_not_really_sure_if_i_should_ask_this_question) 

And in said thread that I made you wrote one of the most wonderful and amazing life stories that I've had the honor of reading. The situation at that time wasn't good, and it only got worse. For about 6-7 months I lived on the street. And it took me awhile to learn to ask people for things like spare change etc, as I didn't like asking people for handouts.

So anyway, I ended up living in the streets in the city when one day my older brother walks past. I was asleep at the time and he woke me up and broke down in tears. He said that he had been looking for me for quite some time but gave up. He had been kicked out of the Jehovah's Witnesses religion as well, thus ex-communicated from the family. So he was trying to find me to see how I was doing. He invited me to move in with him, so currently I am happily living under a roof, in a warm bed. 

Also I am now attending university, to become a primary school teacher. I only just recently started so it's still very new to me. Anyway, I just really wanted to thank you for your amazing story. I can honestly say that I don't think I would be typing this, if it wasn't for you. Your story gave me hope. Hope that despite things being shitty, that there was a better future. 

Thank You.

<TITLE> [TOMT] European movie about a (possibly Roma) girl who loses her job on a food truck </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-08-20 16:14:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It came out since the 90s.  In it, a very poor girl, possibly a Roma, would keep things cold/secure in a bag she'd sink into a pond.  She'd put on big boots that she didn't keep at her house.  She'd trek a long way to her job on a food truck.  She suffered from some sort of cramps, possibly menstrual.  I don't remember exactly why she lost her job; maybe the cramps caused her to miss too much work.  Maybe a guy was stealing from it and she was blamed for it.

My impression was that the story was about this poor Roma girl simply trying to get by in the world.

I think its title started with a P and was reminscent of the Japanese animated film Ponyo. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am not robotically inclined at all, but I'm trying to help my son learn how to use the NXT 2.0.  Its manual says that ports 1 and 2 are for touch sensors; however, the NXT itself says that port 2 is for a sound sensor.  When we tried to plug in 2 touch sensors for a simple forward/back program, the touch sensor in port 2 did not seem to work.

I've seen programs on nxtprograms.com that use touch sensors in ports 1 and 2, so what are we doing wrong?

Thank you for your help--and sorry to ask what must be an obvious question. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After many years I've finally realized this isn't the Cowboys team I grew up idolizing.  The first game I actually remember was [this one](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197212230sfo.htm).  Staubach came in at the end, after missing most of the season with a shoulder injury, and pulled out the first of his many legendary miracles.  The next week the Cowboys were blown out 26-3.  :p  

Anyhow, for years before that, and many after, the Cowboys symbolized, at the very least, professionalism and competence in their leadership.  They haven't symbolized that again, of course, since Johnson left.  Which isn't to say that Jones isn't a brilliant businessman, but no sports fans support teams because their owners are good at brand-building.

As I've mentioned before, Garrett really is my last hope for the Cowboys to be good again in my lifetime.  He's got what it takes intellectually, and I don't mind the mistakes as he learns.  I just want to see improvement.  So if Jones actually does stick by him and surrenders to his intelligence and football competence, they have a chance.

Most of the fans who complain about him, I think, maybe actually didn't play football past, say, junior high.  I played in college, and I can say that, based on my experience, how he handles team-building and the media is precisely how a good coach would behave.  *Praise publicly, critique privately.*  I'm not sure I first learned that on a football team, but it's certainly an approach to leadership I admire, practice, and support.

The problem is of course Jerry.  People talk about Stephen like he's going to be better--and he might.  But I haven't seen anything suggesting either way.

Anyhow, if Jones fires Garrett, I think I finally might be able to cut the cord.  I look around at the teams that do symbolize the values I admire in life--the Steelers, Giants, Ravens, Packers.  Some of those teams have ridden the cycle of success that the NFL generates--but at least they've been on it.  Other teams, like the Raiders, Cowboys of late, Chiefs, and so on, fell off and never got back on--because of the quality of their leadership (or lack thereof).

I wouldn't want to follow a team because of the personality of a coach or player--those things change.  But a system or approach I could appreciate.

Or maybe really at my age it just might be time to let the NFL go.  I can't say it's made my life any better being a fan.  It's been much more enjoyable and rewarding to be a fan of my wife, my children, my friends.  That it would take a lifetime to overcome the brainwashing of propaganda speaks to the strength of societal forces.

We really do only have a limited time in which to accomplish our lives.  I know, when we're young we think we have forever.  We think nothing of days spent like [this one](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/177229).  But as the clock ticks, as we grow up, accomplish, and age, we realize inevitably the transience and brevity of existence.

As youths, we accrue things to care about.  Often because friends/society have told us that we should care.  But as we age, we begin to push those away which we find irrelevant or, often, which don't live up to our standards.

So we'll see what happens this year.  The Cowboys almost certainly won't be Super Bowl champs.  Honestly, if they even make the playoffs I'll be amazed, as the second half of their schedule looks hard.

But under Garrett they have grown from a lackadaisical team demonstrating the complete lack of effort they showed in that [Packers game](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201011070gnb.htm), which resulted in Phillips' firing, to, last year, a scrappy, *interesting* team, which, despite its mistakes, never once gave up trying or grew dull.  

As that pretty much describes every person of note, for now they seem to be a team worth following.  If Jones just can resist his mercurial impulses to interfere, they could be developing into something.

In life, character, will, effort all matter.  In a way, Garrett is conducting an experiment to see if the same things can change the course of an NFL team. </TEXT>

<TITLE> A short conversation with an atheist friend </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-03-30 19:29:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I had a conversation recently with a friend who, it turned out, claimed to be atheist.  She's the only atheist I've encountered to whom I could say what I'm about to tell you without becoming offended, and even she bridled.

I told her that even the absence of belief was a belief system, though it was a system defined by her perspective of the value of logic and experience.  I also told her that in my experience when I encountered an atheist, s/he often thought I was religious, and when I encountered religious people they often thought I was atheist.  In any event, she said that she found the idea, that she might be defined by the fact that she didn't believe in an imaginary being, as mildly offensive.

However, I then asked her if she believed in the tooth fairy.  When she said she didn't, I said neither did I.  And I said that even though I don't believe in it, I recognized that not believing it was a choice I'd made, and that to whatever tiny extent my life was affected by that choice, it had defined me.  For instance, if I had a tooth capped, I didn't save the pieces/debris of the real tooth and put it under my pillow.  And I told her that by not believing in the tooth fairy, I wasn't being defined by what others didn't believe, but instead being defined (to a tiny extent, of course) by what I did believe: that a tooth fairy didn't exist.

She didn't really have a response to that.

It strikes me that we are so fearful of what we believe/don't believe that we often resist even considering that we might be wrong.  But we often define ourselves by who we're not.  And we become angry at others for reminding ourselves of it.  

That is not a righteous anger. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He died young.  A smoker.  When people just were beginning to realize how bad it was.

I've seen this day coming my entire life.  Now that it's here, I don't have any startling observation.  Except maybe that his life was far too short; the whole of it was encompassed in just a few years.  His dreams, aspirations, desires, accomplishments.

All of it gone now for almost as long as he was here.  Except me.  I remain.

His death when I was 6 (and then later my mom's) defined so much of [who I became](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/rr0bl/im_not_really_sure_if_i_should_ask_this_question/c47zg09).  Who I am.  My relationship to my own children.  To my son, my eldest, now 6.  

To the world.  My profession.  My own dreams.  My understanding of mortality.  Everyone I've met.

There's just an absence, as there has been my entire life.  A sorrow that never went away.

I wonder what he would say.  I wonder that I've gone so long without feeling his touch.  Of course I don't remember his voice.

It's been decades and still I miss him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The mods would like to thank everyone who offered to help moderate our sub.  The applications generally all were excellent, and the applicants all impressed us with their interest, enthusiasm, experience, and ideas.  Thank you.

Our discussion about who to add was engaged and considered.  The decision was not easy, in light of the quality of persons who applied.

Ultimately we decided only to add three--chiefly in an attempt to balance our need for help with our disinterest in causing unnecessary disruption.  Each of the persons we finally chose has been engaged in the community and has demonstrated a lifelong interest in writing.  Which in no way should suggest that the persons we did not choose are not.

R/writing has grown a lot over the past year.  We look forward to continuing to try to provide what writers need, whether the approach is as a vocation or avocation.  We remain open to your ideas, suggestions, and criticisms.  We do genuinely appreciate every user and our obligation to provide as functional an online space as possible for you.

Thank you again for your help, and welcome to our new mods!

Regards,

<DATE> 2013-01-04 15:02:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm a mod in r/cowboys.  It's late for me to be the first to say congratulations to you guys for the tremendous progress the Redskins showed this year.  But let me say it anyway: congratulations.  If Griffin can stay healthy, he and Morris may be excellent for years.  And Shanahan, of course, is a proven winner who seems to be following his formula for success.

That said, the mods weren't aware of [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Redskins/comments/15j4cm/cowboys_fan_here_any_bet_any_takers/) and wouldn't have supported it if we were.  He obviously is a kid or a blowhard, and this post is an embarrassment to sports fans and an affront to reality.

I won't apologize for his conduct, because of course I didn't have anything to do with it.  But this kind of post doesn't encourage the spirit of healthy competitiveness that lies at the heart of every sports rivalry.

The first Cowboys game I ever noticed was [this one](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197212310was.htm).  Over the years, I've seen a lot of excellent Cowboys/Redskins games and a lot of dogs.  I've seen each team rise and fall in precisely the manner the NFL seems to like its teams to develop.

I don't know how many years I have left (none of us do), but I anticipate a lot more entertainment from this rivalry and a lot of good-natured ribbing from fans of both sides.  If I never see or hear of another comment like this guy's, I won't mind a bit.

I wish you guys a lot of joy in the playoffs.  Best to you all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sometimes shopping on it is so miserable.  I read a lot, and I don't want a kindle, but I haven't figured out yet how to shop for hardbacks *and* paperbacks within various genres without jumping through a bunch of hoops to filter out kindle.  

I also buy toys for my kids.  But even that sometimes is ridiculously difficult, as it seems that unless I find the perfect search term I miss out on lots of possibilities.  Not to mention that sometimes, oddly, Amazon prime items don't show up at all.

It would be nice to combine sort options, like *number* of customer reviews and "avg. customer review".  Or to have more sort options than the 5 provided.

Or to have the option of more than 24 showing in a list.

Amazon is just not an easy site to browse.

Hopefully this won't get down-voted too much, because I'd genuinely appreciate any suggestions people have on how to use the site more effectively. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The most preposterous team I've ever seen </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-10-29 01:08:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Surely in the history of the NFL there have been teams that have caused their fans more heartbreak.  Maybe I was spoiled by 35 years of mostly success, so I never noticed them.  But I do not remember ever seeing a team play like this one.

Bryant at one moment can look like an ungainly stork snagging a fish and the next he can do an idiotic thing like not make the proper adjustment or just forget not to sling his arm out when he falls--thereby costing them the game.  Best WR on the team is the TE.  2nd and 1, 3rd and 1, 4th and 1, game on the line, 3 passes in a row.  A starting RB who isn't quick and doesn't know how to make a cut.  One of the greatest QBs statistically in the history of the league constantly belittled because his WRs are imbeciles.

I've just never seen anything like this.

Obviously Garrett lost all confidence in Jones; that's why he ran the ball--what, only 2x in the second half?

Only recommendations I could make to Garrett: 1) don't start Jones again; 2) let someone other than Bryant catch punts.

Recommendations for Jones: 1) for God's sake, set aside your ego and hire a GM who knows how to evaluate players; 2) no  matter what, don't let Ryan go; 3) institute a ticket rebate for fans who can prove they screamed the whole game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been playing onliners for *many* years.  For the first time ever, yesterday my account was hacked.  When I tried to log in, I was told that my email address couldn't be found.  I also received an email from Arena Net saying that my email address had been changed.

I put in a ticket but apparently there's a big backlog on hacked accounts.

Also apparently there's a method in place for making email addresses difficult to change, which is based on the email authentication system.

I had tried to authenticate my email address many times (every time I logged on) without success.  Apparently Arena Net knows about this problem too.  I kept getting a message (if I remember correctly) that the URL wasn't valid.

No idea why Arena Net didn't require email confirmation of email address changes.

Anyway, further, apparently Arena Net disabled changing passwords to try to prevent hacking.  Obviously didn't do much good, since all the hacker had to do was change my email address instead.

And no I didn't share my password or account info with anyone.

Hoping that eventually I get my account back, that it hasn't been raided and everything cleaned out.  Not like I had a lot in there anyway.  But, still, what I had, I'd earned.  I wasn't involved in the karma hack.  Not even sure what a karma weapon is.

Just wanted to submit this as a caution to everybody.  Make your password *complicated*.  I thought mine was, but it wasn't enough.  

Hopefully I won't get downvoted just for letting people know about this. </TEXT>
