 anyway, This is a peer-reviewed study published in Geophysical Research Letters journal. Wikipedia says about this journal

 Geophysical Research Letters is a biweekly peer-reviewed scientific journal of geoscience published by the American Geophysical Union that was established in 1974. The editor-in-chief is Noah Diffenbaugh.

According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2015 impact factor of 4.212.[3] Geophysical Research Letters was also the 5th most cited publication on climate change between 1999 and 2009.[4]

here's the citation, the abstract, and the plain languagesummary

since you feel so strongly perhaps contact the Journal and tell them they are publishing junk science. I'm sure there are avenues they have to challenge the research they publish </TEXT>

<TEXT> CITATION: Takamitsu Ito, Shoshiro Minobe, Matthew C. Long and Curtis Deutsch, "Upper Ocean O2 trends: 1958-2015," (Geophysical Research Letters, April 2017). 

Abstract

Historic observations of dissolved oxygen (O2) in the ocean are analyzed to quantify multidecadal trends and variability from 1958 to 2015. Additional quality control is applied, and the resultant oxygen anomaly field is used to quantify upper ocean O2 trends at global and hemispheric scales. A widespread negative O2 trend is beginning to emerge from the envelope of interannual variability. Ocean reanalysis data are used to evaluate relationships with changes in ocean heat content (OHC) and oxygen solubility (O2,sat). Global O2 decline is evident after the 1980s, accompanied by an increase in global OHC. The global upper ocean O2 inventory (01000 m) changed at the rate of 243  124 T mol O2 per decade. Further, the O2 inventory is negatively correlated with the OHC (r = 0.86; 01000 m) and the regression coefficient of O2 to OHC is approximately 8.2  0.66 nmol O2 J1, on the same order of magnitude as the simulated O2-heat relationship typically found in ocean climate models. Variability and trends in the observed upper ocean O2 concentration are dominated by the apparent oxygen utilization component with relatively small contributions from O2,sat. This indicates that changing ocean circulation, mixing, and/or biochemical processes, rather than the direct thermally induced solubility effects, are the primary drivers for the observed O2 changes. The spatial patterns of the multidecadal trend include regions of enhanced ocean deoxygenation including the subpolar North Pacific, eastern boundary upwelling systems, and tropical oxygen minimum zones. Further studies are warranted to understand and attribute the global O2 trends and their regional expressions.

Plain Language Summary


This new paper describes the analysis of the dissolved oxygen in the global ocean using the most recent version of the World Ocean Database for the period of 1955 to 2015. After careful examination of the data, we found that a statistically significant, widespread O2 decline is emerging beyond the envelope of natural fluctuations. Our study also reveals a tight relationship between O2 inventories and the ocean heat content. The spatial pattern and magnitude of this relationship are consistent with expectations derived from mechanistic ocean climate models forced under climate warming scenarios. Taken together, the trends we document here are suggestive of the effects of the ocean warming beginning to supersede natural variability and emerge as a recognizable signal. This merits additional scrutiny over the coming years. </TEXT>

<TEXT> http://climatenewsnetwork.net/ocean-oxygen-decline-greater-predicted/

LONDON, 10 May, 2017  US scientists who have been warning that warmer oceans are more likely to be poorer in dissolved oxygen have now sounded the alarm: ocean oxygen levels are indeed falling, and seemingly falling faster than the corresponding rise in water temperature.

That colder water can hold more dissolved gas than warmer water is a commonplace of physics: it is one reason why polar seas are teeming with marine life and tropical oceans are blue, clear and often relatively impoverished.

In 2013, an international consortium of marine scientists warned that oxygen levels in the oceans could fall by between 1% and 7% by the centurys end. And this could, other scientists predicted, lead to what they politely called respiratory stress for some marine life.
Ocean warming

Ocean ecologists in the US and Germany warned last year that parts of the deep oceans were already showing signs of oxygen deprivation with corresponding dead zones.

Earlier this year, another research group looked at the computer simulations for the years 1920 to 2100 and predicted that the hazards were likely to increase with warming.

Now the team have returned to the issue. They report in Geophysical Research Letters that they looked at data for the last 50 years and found the oxygen levels started dropping in the 1980s, as ocean temperatures began to climb  and falling unexpectedly rapidly.

***The trend of oxygen falling is about two to three times faster than what we predicted from the decrease of solubility associated with ocean warming,*** says Takamitsu Ito, of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology, who led the study.

This is most likely due to the changes in ocean circulation and mixing associated with the heating of the near-surface waters and the melting of polar ice. </TEXT>

The thing is You MUST care for yourself. The dark circles under your eyes are due from lack of sleep. You need to schedule a really good nights sleep. Maybe use a melatonin or another sleep aid.

As for your mother, spend as much quality time as you can with her. Tell her you love her, say everything you need to say to her. when her time comes, give her permission to go. I personally believe we will all meet again in the afterlife

One thing that has really helped me come to terms with death has been studying near-death experiences. There are really some absolutely wonderful uplifting beautiful experiences people have.

maybe this will help reading some of these for you?

Hillary Clinton is a warmongering, corrupt, center-right politician. She is NOT left-wing. Not even remotely.

the republicans throw out some baseless claims of corruption (which she was cleared of),

lol, you can't be serious. Her whole foundation was nothing but a money-laundering scheme. It was a means to allow anybody, ***including foreign government officials***, to "donate" to her, in order to influence her policies. Of course none of these were donations, they were BRIBES.

The sooner America wakes up and realizes this, the better off we all will be.

<TEXT> let's face it, most TV shows have very standard lighting. One TV show pretty much looks like the next when it comes to lighting.

But American gods is very different. Lots of deep shadows, lots of dark contrasts, and I love it.

The cinematography is something you would expect from a high budget film, rather than from a TV show.

(Slight spoiler) . The scene where the black lady devours that poor son of a bitch in bed, then it cuts to that beautiful tracking shot in the bar where you are inside an enormous alligator mouth with enormous white teeth. They are telling you You are inside the belly of the beast. Beautiful filming.

The blood is over-the-top bright red and gushing out in ridiculously large volumes. it is such a stark contrast to the otherwise subdued color palette.

the show has a very unique feel to it, and I really appreciate that because it's rare and hard to do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/major-report-prompts-warnings-that-the-arctic-is-unraveling1/

The report increases projections for global sea-level rise, which takes into account all sources of melting including the Arctic. Their new minimum estimates are now almost double those issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2013 for some emissions scenarios. In fact, the latest calculations suggest that the IPCC's middle estimates for sea-level rise should now be considered minimum estimates.

But this woman forged a deceptive mask and wore that mask for YEARS, in order to manipulate her husband into marriage and kids. Then she rips off the mask and reveals that she's been lying and deceiving. The whole time and she thinks OP's beloved brother is nothing but a pathetic interloper that should be discarded immediately.

then she acts like nothing is wrong, and she wants to have another kid

I do not believe there is any counseling strategy that can get over that. What on earth is a counselor going to say to move past that? </TEXT>

<TEXT> a Zen student read about the ancient Masters and how they learned superhuman abilities. He decided he would learn how to levitate.

For years and years and years he worked at learning how to levitate. After 30 years he finally succeeded. One day the Buddha came to visit his village. He was overjoyed. He ran up to the Buddha and told him he wanted to show him something. He sat on the edge of the river, levitated up, levitated over the River and to the next bank.

He opened his eyes and waited for the Buddhas reaction.

<TITLE> Here is what I noticed about Mitch Trubisky's throwing motion </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-30 18:54:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Mitch cocks back his arm and launches the ball from his shoulder area. You can see very plainly what I am talking about in this video

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhWz8SGetFM feature=youtu.be

Now compare this to drew brees' throwing motion. Look at exactly the 12 second mark on this video. Look how high his hand is above his shoulder when he releases the ball.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngel-VlrgAk

Brees has nearly perfect form. That is how you should throw the ball. Rogers and Brady throw it very similar. Why is this good form?

In a word: physics. think about a 1 pound rock being thrown from a catapult with a 3 foot long arm. Now think about the same rock being thrown from a catapult with a 9 foot long arm. Obviously, the rock is going to go further with the 9 foot long arm

The longer you extend your arm before releasing the ball, the more velocity and power the ball will have on it

Now it's not impossible to succeed in the NFL with Mitch's throwing motion. Philip Rivers comes to mind as somebody who launches it from the shoulder and has been successful in doing that. However! It is not the optimal method of throwing the football.

to read more up on throwing motions Here's a good article, which backs up my point.

In fact, both wars have made our country weaker, more vulnerable, unable to fund desperately needed infrastructure, unable to fund education, etc.

nearly all of our military actions in the Middle East have created MORE terrorism than was there before

<TEXT> I have no idea.

Then again, I live in a country that is willing to spend $6 TRILLION dollars (and counting!) on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan without blinking an eye. Not to mention spending billions and billions and billions of dollars on a stupid senseless Needless tragic "war against terrorism" that is accomplished nothing but misery.

We will drop hundred $150 million on one airstrike on a  abandoned Syrian airfield and think nothing of it.

But when it comes to stuff like our own infrastructure, or making awesome things for us like an indoor park We can't find the money.

Oh well, that's just America I guess

<TEXT> Here is my wacky idea on what to do with one of these failed malls.

First counter intuitively put in a very large grocery store. It's an odd choice for a mall, but it's one of the few brick-and-mortar stores that aren't going out of business.

Then convert large area inside the mall into a indoor park. Install beautiful water features, some nice walking paths, playground playthings for the kids, and indoor growing grass.

People will come for the park. They will love it. Then bring in stores near the indoor park that cater to what people want. Maybe a bowling alley? Or a laundromat?

That way you can do your laundry, do your grocery shopping, and enjoy a relaxing afternoon in the park at the same time

<TEXT> Brick-and-mortar retail stores are finding it impossible to compete with online sellers, and are closing physical stores, left and right.

Apparel retail has been particularly hard hit, with The Limited, Wet Seal, BCBG Max Azria, and Vanity Shop of Grand Forks each seeking court protection in 2017. The latest victim was Payless Inc., which filed for bankruptcy April 4 and said it would shutter 400 stores. 

Rue21 may be next. The embattled teen apparel chain is said to be filing for bankruptcy as soon as this month, according to people familiar with the matter. Or perhaps it will be Gymboree, which Bloomberg News reported is preparing to file for bankruptcy as a June 1 debt payment looms.

however, it's just interesting to discover how a small thing like the closing of the Panama isthmus created MAJOR climate shifts all over the planet.

I mean, if I'm reading the article correctly from the Woods Hole the only reason parts of North America and northern Europe are even habitable today are because the warm ocean current shifted after the Panamanian isthmus closed </TEXT>

<TEXT> whoa! 

so basically the whole ice ageWas caused by the closing of the Panamanian isthmus?

http://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/feature/how-the-isthmus-of-panama-put-ice-in-the-arctic.

The principal engine of this global circulation, often called the Ocean Conveyor, is the difference in salt content between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Before the Isthmus of Panama existed, Pacific surface waters flowed into the Atlantic. Their waters mixed, roughly balancing the two oceans salinity.

About 5 million years ago, the North American, South American, and Caribbean Plates began to converge. The gradual shoaling of the Central American Seaway began to restrict the exchange of water between the Pacific and Atlantic, and their salinities diverged.

Evaporation in the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean left ocean waters there saltier and put fresh water vapor into the atmosphere. The Trade Winds carried the water vapor from east to west across the low-lying Isthmus of Panama and deposited fresh water in the Pacific through rainfall. As a result, the Pacific became relatively fresher, while salinity slowly and steadily increased in the Atlantic.

As a result of the Seaway closure, the Gulf Stream intensified. It transported more warm, salty water masses to high northern latitudes, where Arctic winds cooled them until they became dense enough to sink to the ocean floor. The Ocean Conveyor was rolling, drawing even more Gulf Stream waters northward.

snip

On their journey to the North Pacific, these deep waters became enriched in nutrients and carbon dioxide. In the Subarctic Pacific, these deep waters could have upwelled, rising to the sunlit surface to provide the ingredients to spark enormous blooms of phytoplankton. Great abundances of silica and opal (the preserved material from the phytoplankton shells) in seafloor sediments are evidence of both the blooms and the strong upwelling.

The upwelling may have been so strong, however, that the phytoplankton did not keep pace with the upwellingthat is, more carbon dioxide upwelled than was used by the phytoplankton. Consequently, the excess carbon dioxide leaked back into the atmosphere, adding a greenhouse gas that warmed the planet.

What shut down the Mid-Pliocene Warm Period about 2.7 million years ago? And what finally caused Northern Hemispheric glaciation at about the same timebut nearly 2 million years after the Isthmus of Panama formed?

Neal Driscoll and Gerald Haug proposed one solution. They postulated that moisture carried northward by the Gulf Stream was transported by prevailing westerly winds to Eurasia. It fell as rain or snow, eventually depositing more fresh water into the Arctic Oceaneither directly, or via the great Siberian rivers that empty into the Arctic Ocean.

The added fresh water would have facilitated the formation of sea ice, which would reflect sunlight and heat back into space. It would also act as a barrier blocking heat stored in the ocean from escaping to the atmosphere above the Arctic. Both these phenomena would further cool the high latitudes. In addition, Arctic waters flowing back into the North Atlantic would have become less cold and saltyshort-circuiting the efficiency of the Ocean Conveyor belt as a global heat pump to North Atlantic regions. </TEXT>

high-class corporate executives, Senators, governors, movie stars, etc. this is who they use. Those types are getting laid all the time and never get caught. Because they're smart and they are rich and they're willing to spend the money on it.

Apparently we have unlimited funds to destroy infrastructure in other countries. Iraq's infrastructure For instance, has been pretty much decimated since we've been there. We destroyed Libya's infrastructure and then never rebuilt it After we "liberated" that country A couple years back.

And these days we are destroying Syria's infrastructure, and then just today we dropped the largest nonnuclear bomb in history  on Afghanistan's infrastructure.

I'm tired of this idea that you have to treat the right wing with kid gloves and nicey nicey statements and if you don't, you're somehow totally biased. It's fundamentally ridiculous approach

the right wing in this country is the very definition of dug in stubborn dogmatic intractable, unhinged from reality, viewpoint.

I mean look at their approach to global warming. It's completely divorced from all reality and extraordinarily harmful. Also LITERALLY NOTHING you can say to these people will change their mind on it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> in 2013 Republicans were OVERWHELMINGLY and VEHEMENTLY opposed to Obama's airstrikes in Syria in retaliation against chemical attack. 29% of Democrats also opposed it.

In 2017 Republicans were OVERWHELMINGLY SUPPORTIVE of trumps airstrikes in Syria in retaliation against a chemical attack. 29% of Democrats opposed it.

Are you going to sit there and look me in the eye and tell me both sides are the same? Give me a break. The facts, the statistics and observable reality says they are not the same

the point is the right wing seems to have no actual philosophy, other than "when we do something, it's good. When they (i.e. evil liberals) do the exact same thing It's bad."

it's fundamentally insane. And this country is going to pay for this insanity

I feel like you need to be more plugged into his unit, and foster more connections with other spouses and his fellow soldiers, commanding officers, etc.

Personally I would not talk to him on the phone. I would compose an email stating very very clearly and calmly why what he did was extraordinarily rude and completely disrespectful of your feelings. And until he understands that, and legitimately apologizes, this is going to continue to be a problem.

Then I would ignore his phone calls for a month or so. Then when you finally talked to him say "well, golly Gee, I just thought it would be easier on deployment for you if You didn't actually talk to me because then you'd miss me less"

<TEXT> His office has estimated the scholarship will cost $163 million in the first year, but some lawmakers say that's lowballing it. An estimated 200,000 students would be eligible once the program is fully implemented. 

To give some perspective. The recent US missile strike on an abandoned airfield in Syria (which was in use days later) cost well over $100 million.

So this is about the same cost as 1.3 missile strikes that seem to have mysteriously missed most of their targets.

Which do you think is a better investment?

another way of looking at it is  this. The "war" on Isis cost US taxpayers $1.5 billion a a month. So this program could be funded for entire school year on what we are paying for a fantastically ineffectual and tragic war that is accomplishing nothing

It has sort of an NDE/judgment day theme going on.

Welcome to the final show

You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky

You look pretty good down here

But you ain't really good


It seems to be suggesting a person has died and left the body, and now faces judgment of his life. But St. Peter cannot be bribed with money. Maybe he/she was viewed as a good person on earth, but it's a different thing On the other side.

Breaking through the atmosphere

And things are pretty good from here

Remember everything will be alright

We can meet again somewhere

Somewhere far away from here

Again with the theme of leaving the earth, and looking back on it. "We can meet again." Refers to the people he is leaving behind.

We never learn, we been here before

Sort of has a reincarnation theme, or a Buddhist wheel of samsara thing going on. The notion you continue to reincarnate again and again until you finally learn the lessons you have been trying to learn

We should do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian Darwinian theory he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.

******  SPOILERS   **************

The central ethical issue of the movie presents a scenario in which you could murder millions of people, with the INTENTION of creating a better world. Which Initially Did happen. Dr. Manhattan did indeed create a better world

So it begs the question Is it okay to kill a few million completely innocent people If the ends justify the means?

of course Rorschach fucked the whole thing up At the end 

are you aware that US Armed Forces just killed a bunch of innocent civilians in Syria? And, in fact, the wars started by America in Iraq and Afghanistan have killed literally HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS of civilians. 500,000 innocent men, women and child in Iraq alone. But we justify this by saying "well, we're fighting the bad guys and helping to create a better world."

There are three videos by the weeknd, that when viewed together form a coherent story. The story is about an unknown singer who meets a kind of Mephistopheles figure, makes a deal with that guy, becomes famous, regrets his deal with the devil, attempts to negate the deal, fails and winds up realizing he cannot out run the devil and accept his fate.

notice how everything changes when he makes the deal and the Mephistopheles figure throws the lighter at 2:40

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEI4qSrkPAs

notice that 2:12. It's the same guy, only this time, things are different. he kills the Mephistopheles figure and buries his body in the desert. His deal with the devil has been canceled Or so he thinks.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEI4qSrkPAs


but things don't go well , and he crashes and burns Literally. Uh oh! Who is that at 3:48? Looks like he's holding an Apple, obvious Garden of Eden reference

<TEXT> I watch a lot of cooking shows, and the amount of sugar These people are adding to main courses that are supposed to be savory is insane

barbecue is the worst offender. First, they marinate the meat in some kind of vinegar base with tons of brown sugar added, then they baste it while it's cooking with some kind of sauce that has tons of sugar added, then they top it off with barbecue sauce infused with tons of sugar again.

Virtually every sauce, dressing, and whatnot I see these people adding cupfuls of sugar to

I absolutely love love love Thai food. But those people sure do like to add palm sugar to everything.

I mean if you're consuming this much sugar in the main course, then you're drinking sweet tea or Coca-Cola with your meal, and then finishing it off with a piece of pie you have consumed enough calories for a small family for entire week.

And people wonder why we're so overweight!

I like my savory dishes Savory!

<TEXT> How serious are you about this issue? If it's truly a make or break then stop fucking around!

Don't nag him. don't "turn up the pressure." Don't ask ever again. Not one single time.

Have one single conversation about this. 

Say something like "you know I love you with all my heart and want to be with you forever and want to have your children and want to be married. That's what I really really want. But this issue with where you get your money is HUGE. It's a dealbreaker. Either you tell me where your money comes from by_______ or we are through. I'm not going to ask again and we're not going to have this conversation again. That's it."

I mean that's how you do it. If it's truly a dealbreaker then put it on the table and get serious about it. All of the nagging in the world isn't going to do diddly squat After seven years. stop floating around in it wishy-washy fog, put on your big girl pants and make it happen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The answer is super incredibly simple 

The working-class got used and abused, and essentially raped by the corporate class. The working-class then got angry and irrationally lashed out at the wrong targets.

It's human history. It's always the same thing. The wealthy elite want to extract as much capital and resources from the working-class as they can, even if that means massive suffering. It sociopathic essentially.

And then when things go wrong The corporate class asks "oh, golly Gee! What could possibly have caused this?"

<TEXT> cool fact!

One of the first people to introduce zen Buddhism to Japan, also brought the tea leaf with him from China.

Because of that tea and Buddhism have always been intricately linked in Japan, thus giving rise to the tea ceremony.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisai.

The zen monks loved to drink the tea because the caffeine gave them energy to meditate all night if necessary. So if you do drink caffeinated drinks with your meditation, you are in good company.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_tea_ceremony

However! I would not recommend drinking coffee Since it's a cholagogue, which means that it stimulates the liver to produce bile which is a big part of the digestive process. I think green tea is best, personally. </TEXT>

If you're really interested in the nutrition aspect of it, then Dr. Jason Fung is the guy you want to listen to. Also, Dr. Rhonda Patrick has some good things to say. Go to YouTube and put in Jason's name and you get tons of great videos.

I do short fasts of two  three days. But even a short fasts of 24 hours is still beneficial. I eat nothing at all, although I will sip on watered-down Gatorade from time to time. I also take endogenous ketones in supplement form. Ketones are what your body produces during a fast, and are fantastically healthy, anti-inflammatory, appetite suppressing, and great brain fuel

<TEXT> I posted about meditation combined with fasting before.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/5xhixc/nothing_and_i_mean_absolutely_nothing_will/

I just got done with another short fast, during which I did quite a bit of meditation. There is something That happens when you fast, and meditate at the same time where you are able to see deep deep into your soul. You are able to see things that otherwise would remain hidden, and you can confront those things, and let go of those things.

I have made more progress during short periods of fasting and meditation than I have in months and months of just meditating alone. once you reach a certain fasting level, you can clear your mind and enter into a deep meditative state in about 2 to 3 minutes.

it's funny because I'm on fasting subreddits, and nobody there talks about meditation.  And I'm on meditation subs and nobody there talks about fasting. It's the COMBINATION of the two that is so incredibly powerful.

if you feel stuck,or sluggish in your meditation practice, try fasting. You will be amazed.

Reddit became a direct subsidiary of Cond Nast's parent company, Advance Publications, in September 2011. As of August 2012, Reddit operates as an independent entity, although Advance is still its largest shareholder.[9]

I actually find that sentiment somewhat amusing. This website is owned by Cond Nast, and despite that specific sub Reddit wildly violating rule after rule after rule they were never deleted nor even barely punished. This is despite the fact that other subs that only did 1/64th of what they did were permanently deleted.

Why?

Simple. Traffic. Clicks. Advertising dollars. Etc.

Cond Nast WANTED and LOVED this sub. In fact, my crazy wacky conspiracy theory is that most media related entities wanted Donald Trump is president simply because they knew it would be great for business. They did not give a shit how bad or good of a president he would be, they just knew it would be good for their bottom line </TEXT>

good grief This is corporate propaganda At its worst.

But an extensive examination by The New York Times indicates that the debate has missed a more basic problem  genetic modification in the United States and Canada has not accelerated increases in crop yields or led to an overall reduction in the use of chemical pesticides.

https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/business/gmo-promise-falls-short.html

The two monsters are very very very similar. The shape of their heads, Their mouths, teeth, and tongues are almost identical. Plus they are both reptilian like creatures, neither has very much personality, and both are essentially murder machines hell-bent on killing humans For some reason. their mannerisms are very similar, their intelligence level seems to be about the same, etc.

Is that a coincidence? Did 2 completely unrelated creative teams dream up nearly identical monsters for two separate films that just happened to be released at the same time?

is that possible? I don't know enough about how Hollywood works, but as an outsider looking in that seems extraordinarily unlikely.

for the longest time they completely and totally denied climate change altogether. Then when the evidence became absolutely overwhelmingly obvious, they shifted gears and said, "okay, maybe there is climate change. But it is DEFINITELY not caused by humans!"

They continue to move the goalposts. remember the "pause" in global warming. A few years back? They were all over that llike flies on shit. Then when it became obvious there really was no pause Suddenly they dropped that and never mentioned it again

They are coming from a fundamentally dishonest stance.  That is why it's so difficult to debate them. They did not arrive at their conclusions to reason and logic. They arrived at their conclusions through emotions and biases and sometimes pure belligerence.

 This is why Fact and logic-based arguments simply bounce off of them </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is one of those things where there is no right or wrong answer.

Question: Have you ever fasted and prayed? Most Christians are simply completely ignorant about the power of fasting. Fasting will accelerate your spiritual growth like nothing else, it will also somewhat dissolve the barrier between this world and the spirit world, making hearing the voice of the spirit easier.

Only YOU can decide what is right here. But you have to get in touch with your deepest spirit to know that. My advice is to take some time away and fast and pray about this and find out what you really really want to do deep deep inside of you. Find out what you truly believe is in the best interest of both yourself and your father.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Last night's dateline was a look into the Sarah Goode case. You can watch the whole episode here.

http://www.nbcnews.com/dateline.

Text update here

http://abc7ny.com/news/dante-taylor-gets-life-without-parole-in-murder-of-sarah-goode/1448294/

I'm not going to go into the whole background of the case because it's no longer an unsolved mystery. However! Two things really popped out from this episode.

1. So her car was found abandonment on a street, near a housing complex shortly after she went missing. A whole army of friends and family turned out to volunteer to search the area. They searched and searched and found nothing.

Fast forward a few months they decide to look around in the same area, and lo and behold, her body was there within walking distance of the car. And had been there the whole time.

In other words, an entire army of volunteers simply missed a dead body that was laying right in plain sight.

So anybody who says, "there's no way that person/that body could be in that area because the search party looked there." Well You're just wrong. if they had not decided to go back and look, who knows how long it would of been before they found the body

2. The police in this country  time and again and again act in extraordinarily unprofessional manners that jeopardize investigations.

In this case they were grabbing people who they only vaguely suspected of the crime, screaming and hollering at them, slapping them around, and insisting that they tell the police where the body is. Turns out all of the people they did that to were completely innocent.

do you honestly think that kind of behavior is helping to solve crimes?

And then when they finally arrested the correct suspect, ***they didn't even read him his rights!***  I mean Come on! This meant they had to let him go free, even though they knew it was him due to fingerprints. But the fingerprints were going to be dismissed because they didn't read his rights. Unbelievable.

Luckily for them, somebody else came forward  and they were able to charge the suspect in a separate incident, and therefore got his fingerprints after all.

**The cops in this country desperately need more training and better instructions.**  I'm sorry, but our police officers suck

<TEXT> was reading through the Wikipedia entry on cumin, found it interesting.

Growing up I always knew that it was a big part of modern Mexican cuisine, but it is native originally to Iran and then spread to Africa and Asia. Was not introduced to the New World until the Portuguese came.

Also, apparently, there are different grades of this spice. The best comes from Iran

The Greeks kept it in its own container on the table, much like we keep salt-and-pepper. So basically anytime your food tasted a little bit bland you would grab the cumin and shake away

<TEXT> If you feel stuck in your meditation practice then try fasting.

There is nothing in this world, no book, no expensive meditation retreat and/or seminar, no technique, no teacher, that will accelerate and transform your meditation practice like fasting.

before Jesus' public ministry began he fasted for 40 days and 40 nights in the desert.

The Buddha's major breakthrough came while sitting under the bodhi tree after a long fast.

Tibetan yogis, and Taoist masters, both teach you can only reach certain levels of enlightenment through the combination of fasting and meditation together.

Nothing will break down your ego, your psychological and emotional defenses, like going without food for an extended period of time. you want to see into your true nature? Stop eating for a while and do some serious meditation.

I am just coming off a three-day fast and every meditation session during that fast was more powerful and productive than the last.

stop looking for some meditation technique or trick, stop running after the latest fashionable book or teacher or what have you. Just do what every single spiritual master in the history of the earth has done Fast. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was dragged kicking and screaming to the Great Wall, expecting nothing. In fact I expected it to be crappy. It got terrible reviews from critics, and even on rotten tomatoes The audience didn't seem very enthusiastic.

I have to say This was a fun movie! It's sort of reminded me of those old swashbucklers from the 1920s. They are cheesy, b grade, but still lots of fun with great action and even some semi-interesting characters

this sets of this movie are sweeping in scale, and at times absolutely  beautiful. the special effects are all on point. and the main character is seeking personal redemption.

Look, this is not the most original movie ever made. It's not going to win an Oscar. But if you're in a group with kids, teenagers, and adults, I think this movie would be a winner. Just about anybody can find something to enjoy

I'd rather watch this movie again than yet another freaking marvel superhero movie. </TEXT>

It's not "speaking wisdom"! He is a man in deep deep denial about the sexual trauma that he endured, and instead of dealing with it He has spent his adulthood lashing out at everybody and everything.

he is a mean-spirited, nasty, vindictive, hateful asshole while hiding under the mask of "come on guys! I'm just trolling! LOL!"

he never dealt with this festering issue, and now he's taking it out on the world. It's the exact OPPOSITE of the way to deal with this thing effectively.

Saying "going bankrupt is worse than being sexually assaulted as a child." is just another form of denial for him.

he is an extraordinarily damaged individual, who needs serious therapy, probably from one of those terrible, awful liberal" psychotherapists

<TEXT> how can you say the show is crazy and extreme and really out there?

I found it to be fairly tame and quite frankly kind of annoying.

For those who don't know. It's about a guy who has paranoid schizophrenia But wait! Maybe he just has mental superpowers after all!

There's lots of scenes where, for instance, a dog is barking at him. So he looks at the dog all crazy with wild eyes. Then the dog is barking at him. So he looks at the dog all crazy. Then the dog is barking at him. So he looks at the dog all crazy.

same thing happened with a shot of a half opened closet door. I don't know what the purpose of this is, other than to show that he's kind of crazy, but it's really stupid and annoying.

Virtually all of the supporting cast is completely forgettable, with none of them having an actual personality or interesting quirk about them.

Aubrey plaza plays a crazy quirky wild girl Who really isn't that crazy or quirky. I mean, she did one thing which was to trade an old stove for some Drugs! Were talking about drugs here! Can you believe how crazy that is?

I don't know. I wasn't impressed, or even intrigued by this show. I don't think it's a bad show, it just does nothing for me

if you want to watch a crazy and wild show on FX, check out Tabboo. Now that's a legitimately wild show!

First of all I said it's the worst mistake in "modern American history". Modern American history does not include Stalin and Moa etc.

Secondly, America had no choice but to enter World War II. None. We were invaded and we had to defend ourselves. that's that.

We had EVERY choice when it came to Iraq. Invasion was something we absolutely did not need to do in any way shape or form. And yet we did. Based on lies told by a psychopath. And then we enacted policies that gave rise to Isis. Those are historical facts!

<TEXT> the biggest mistake in Modern American history is the invasion of Iraq, and it's not even close. I really believe Americans VASTLY underestimate how devastating that was.

First off it is clear Cheney et al. were well aware Saddam Hussein was not a legitimate threat to the US. They were also well aware he didn't have active weapons of mass destruction, and were well aware, even if he did, he didn't intend to use them.

Despite this, they LIE America into a war. Think about that. They knowingly and willingly lied a nation into war that cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and destabilized an entire region of the planet. That's not just a crime. It's one of the worst crimes I can imagine committing. It is absolutely unconscionable.

Then they invade. They allow the antiquities ministry to be looted, as well as other public buildings. The one ministry They defended with heavily armed troops? The oil ministry.

They kicked out all of Saddam's military infrastructure personnel. They had nowhere to go and nothing to do. So they joined up with wacko extremists and started Isis. That they stole a bunch of Humvees, cash, and millions of weapons from the Americans (conveniently just left them laying around Apparently), and voil! Suddenly a well armed, well-trained, fanatical fighting force was born called Isis. Thanks to very specific American policies.

But at least we rebuilt all of the infrastructure we destroyed when we invaded, right? Wrong. The entire rebuilding budget, hundreds of millions of dollars, was actually all stolen by defense contractors. There was no investigation. No scandal. They just stole it.

so now, Iraq lies in ruins, there is  (completely predictable!). Violence between Shiites and Sunnis,  and Isis is now spilling over the borders and destabilizing Syria and other countries. Because of all the destabilization millions of refugees flee and invade Europe.

This sets off the European Muslim refugee crisis, which is still roiling the continent today.

And again, it's just the gift that keeps on giving and giving and giving. 500,000 people died in the initial invasion of Iraq. An invasion based on lies told by a psychopath named Dick Cheney. 500,000 people all dead for no reason.

latest estimate is that the Afghanistan and Iraq war will cost the US upwards of $7 trillion. And yet we are told we can't afford health care for our citizens, nor can we afford a livable wage in this country. But we have $7 trillion spent on useless pointless tragic war that accomplishes absolutely nothing.

we freed them from Saddam Hussein, and we gave them Isis. You tell me which is worse?

it was, and still is a monstrous crime that we as Americans have committed, and continued to commit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> my good friend J. and I knew each other for a long time. Lots and lots of crazy adventures all across the country. Shared friends and shared weirdness for over two and a half decades.

Unfortunately, his behavior and mental health gradually got worse and worse. He started acting terribly, saying horribly abusive malicious hateful things. I would call him out on it, and then we would argue and argue and argue and yell at each other and scream at each other. it was exhausting.

Then he would be okay for a little bit. That he would start up with the really awful, horrible, hateful malicious crap again. I know it was a undiagnosed mental illness, most likely borderline personality disorder coupled with bipolar disorder. But he refused treatment.

Finally, for my own mental health I had to tell him to fuck off. It was 100% the right thing to do. There is no question about it.

But the thing is I miss him. He's the only person I talked to about certain things. I don't have many good friends, and losing one that I knew for that long, really hurts.

Tonight I really miss him. It sucks. Life sucks sometimes. I kind of want to call him, but there's no way in hell that is going to happen.

<TEXT> spoilers Obviously

so the cephalopods gave humanity the gift of the universal language, with the understanding that in 3000 years humanity would return the favor by helping the cephalopods with Something.

But what exactly could the universal language be used for anyway?

So the language chick learned the language, and as a result could see the future. (Or could she already kind of see the future Before this?)

so does everybody who learns the universal language also get the gift of being able to see the future? no? Then what exactly were they going to with this universal language?

If nobody else gets the gift of being able to see the future when they learn the universal language Why does the language chick gain that ability?

Also Apparently at some point she tells her husband that their child is going to die of cancer. What the hell? Why would you do that?

side note: Did nobody else think the alien spacecraft looked like giant computer mice? LOL </TEXT>

<TEXT> the position of chairman of the Fed is essentially a revolving door for Goldman Sachs employees.

they are at Goldman Sachs, then they get to be chair of the Fed, then they make a bunch of policies which very coincidentally just happen to benefit banks such as Goldman Sachs, then they retire from the Fed and go back to Goldman Sachs.

It's a pretty good gig If you can get it </TEXT>

Dear goodness!

The Fed is going to wage war against Donald Trump and his merry band of Goldman Sachs backed corporate fascists?

Goldman Sachs CONTROLS the fed! And Donald Trump is deep deep deep in bed with Goldman Sachs, as evidenced by the appointing five Goldman Sachs alumni

The notion that Donald Trump is somehow going to stand up for the little guy against the Fed is laughably stupidly ridiculous.

<TEXT> Google "Minocycline for Rheumatoid arthritis" by Carol Eustice

print off that article and get it to your doctor. Multiple people have been permanently healed from rheumatoid arthritis using the antibiotic minocycline. For some strange reason doctors are resistant to the idea that rheumatoid arthritis is actually caused by a bacteria (in this case Mycoplasma), however study after study shows this is probably the case.

also, minoycycline is very safe and usually extremely well tolerated this is not some kind of crazy extremists therapy or anything like that.

If your doctor won't prescribe mino, I personally would find one that's willing to do it. Good luck to you.

<TEXT> first you have to realize that the people who are doing the symbols are well versed in occult symbology. This was demonstrated very clearly in that table of symbols and sigils.

Let's look at the opening graphic as it unfolds here. at exactly 3 seconds that graphic looks very very much like an eyeball. Now, a single eyeball is one of the most common occult symbols in existence. It is known by the eye of Horus, as well as many other names.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Horus

then at 4 seconds, it transforms into a triangle. A triangle and/or a pyramid is of course also one of the most common  occult symbols.

An eyeball + a triangle/pyramid combined create the eye of Providence, which you will recognize as being on all of the dollar bills.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Providence

So the intro in my view is a stylized graphic of the eye of Providence.

<TEXT> there is no need to apologize, you are fine.

So here's the deal.When a person experiences something extremely traumatic sometimes the brain disassociates with itself. This is a protective mechanism. The brain creates an alternate persona that is more capable of dealing with the trauma and abuse than the dominant personality is.

This is probably why this other personality that comes out now and then is kind of an asshole. You created this personality, whether you consciously realize it or not, to be a protector. It's all a coping mechanism related to trauma and abuse.

The reality is this is probably not the first time this has happened to you, this is only the first time you become aware of it happening.

You need to find a psychotherapist who is well-versed in treating dissociative identity disorder (DID), this was formerly called multiple personality disorder. I realize you may not be able to afford it, but these type of therapists are very specialized. there's a  very good chance you can find one who will take on your case pro bono. I have a good feeling you can find one to help you

EDIT: one more quick thing. There are Internet support forums for people with DID. Talking to these people can help you realize you're not some kind of weirdo or freak, and other people are going through exactly what you're going through. They can also help you to find resources and suggest types of therapies that might help you. I'm sorry I can't give you direct links, but if you Google it I am sure you can find some.

<TEXT> as I said I've read at least 3000 NDE accounts. One of the things is very striking is that when people leave their body, sometimes they travel around and visit loved ones. They hear conversations and watch what people are doing.

Then when they come back into their bodies they tell those people what they were doing and those people are absolutely stunned that they somehow knew that

 the characteristic effects of NDE were shown to be reproduced by using the drug Ketamine.

Absolutely not. Nobody's having the very specific type of NDE phenomenon while on ketamine. For instance I've never heard anybody say they had an absolute 100% holographic recall every single moment of their entire life while on ketamine. That's just one example

<TEXT> I've been studying the NDE (near-death experience) phenomenon for about 10 years now. At this point I have read over 3000 NDE accounts.

I now have absolutely zero doubt there is an afterlife none whatsoever. Over and over and over again different people with different religious backgrounds different ethnic backgrounds different belief systems experience the same thing when they leave their bodies. They described the experience as the most real thing they have ever experienced, and that this life on earth is in fact the dream, the spirit world is the real world.

Now NDE accounts don't support a fundamentalist Christian viewpoint, but they most definitely 100% support pretty much all of the teachings of Jesus Christ. I.e. the most important things in life are to love your neighbor as yourself, things like that

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Morgan is about a corporate risk-management consultant who must decide whether or not to terminate an artificially created humanoid being. 

Sounds like a good idea for a movie doesn't it? Intriguing. Lots of potential Right? Here's the cast

Kate Mara, Michelle Yeoh, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Paul Giamatti, Brian Cox, etc.

Directed by Luke Scott who is Ridley Scott's kid

fantastic cast and crew right?

Here's the problem. The characters in this movie repeatedly do things that are mind numbingly stupid. More than once I'm staring at the screen screaming "why are you just standing there? Why don't you _________?"

Also the humanoid being takes a series of actions that they never ever explained why she did those things. There's simply no motivation. It's just like she starts doing these crazy things For no reason. Why?

Also, there is a twist at the end of this movie. A twist that you probably saw it coming about one third of the way through the movie because they blatantly foreshadow it.

a couple of innocent characters die in this movie and I just sat there thinking "you kind of deserve to die for being so incredibly stupid you moron"

I can't believe all of these talented people looked at the script and thought "yeah! This looks good!" Because honestly this is a TERRIBLE script.

This movie is very similar to ex machina. In fact, just watch ex machina and skip this one altogether </TEXT>

Why do people act like this is somehow a new development?

The right wing and their media allies have convinced millions of Americans that the rock solid science of climate change  is a big huge liberal conspiracy. And people acted like this was somehow normal and okay

Nobody really call them out. The news media treated the issue as "climate experts say one thing  but climate skeptics (who are almost always on payroll oil companies but let's pretend that's not happening) say another! Who can know who is right?"

Not to mention many of religious Americans stands on evolution, and a literal belief in a six-day creation, a literal belief in a flood that destroy the world despite zero geological evidence of such a thing, etc. etc.

This is been going on for a long time and it's only going to get worse. Once again Donald Trump just ratcheted up the volume to 11  on something that already is happening </TEXT>

<TITLE> "American Honey": So many elements of a fantastic film, but holy shit! Did this movie ever need a good editor. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-24 17:24:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> "American Honey" is about a young dirt poor white trash girl who joins a roving band of similarly white trash people who go from town to town selling magazine subscriptions. Shia Labuff (spelling?) Is her love interest.

The film oozes authenticity. every character in this movie feels real, every situation is completely believable. Absolutely fantastic job on this. The movie really opens a window into the life of a poor young white trash American. (The movie uses the term "white trash" and that's why I'm using it)

the lead actress is great, it's her first feature film and she's fantastic.

Some of the cinematography also is awesome..

the initial story is involving, believable, and endearing.

The soundtrack is absolutely on point.

The problem?

Holy shit this movie is soooooooooooooooooo long! Way way way too long. it's two hours and 43 minutes, again wait too long Especially for a movie with a paperthin plot that never really goes anywhere.

Absolutely desperately needed a good editor. They could've chopped one hour out of this movie and it would've made it a better movie. there are at least five scenes of these people riding around in a van lip-synching to music. it got old.

My other problem with it is it's sort of eends abruptly  with absolutely no plot resolution of any type. Ugh! Now some of you may like that, and that's fine. I personally like a movie to tell me an actual story. This movie starts telling the story, gets disinterested, then wanders off and peters out

Overall the movie is still worth seeing, just be aware of has serious problems.

Despite this I still recommend it, if only for its raw authenticity that is so rare in movies today </TEXT>

<TEXT> Moore spent months during the 2016 election explaining why Christians should refuse to accept the either-or choice of Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump. He continually used his platform to encourage Christians to raise the level of public discourse and expand the approach to pro-life issues beyond simply ending abortion to including care for the immigrant, impoverished, refugee, and incarcerated.

So he wanted to apply actual comprehensive Christlike principles to these issues instead of simply stopping your feet and demanding "no abortions!"

So it makes no sense that a sharp controversy is now brewing in the Southern Baptist Convention over Moores leadership.

agreed, this makes no sense. This is theoretically a Christian organization, why are they upset that this man is applying Christlike principles to politics? </TEXT>

<TEXT> My reaction to your trip

First off you saw the crazy clowns that they talk about in "the Spirit molecule". Very common.

Secondly, using somebody as your anchor who actively disapproves of psychedelic use is a really bad idea. You are setting yourself up for a bad trip before it even starts.

Set and setting my friend. Yours was all wrong. Your girlfriend was fighting with the spirit of the DMT, you were fighting with your girlfriends psyche, and meanwhile the DMT could not teach you any lessons.


next time, make sure you trip with somebody who actively support you, make sure your mind is calm and clear, and go into it with a good psychological framework. This will really help

The waitstaff is disinterested and unfriendly.

I got a burger both times. The patty was good-sized, but completely bland. The french fries are the same generic fast food fries you get at McDonald's or Burger King.

And on top of this the prices are high.

The great dane is a block away, has better food, better waitstaff, and slightly lower prices. I cannot imagine a single reason anybody should go to Caf Hollander

<TEXT> thank you so much for this.

Wars and geopolitics are almost ALWAYS ALWAYS about natural resources, energy being the major one. all the rhetoric about "freedom , democracy,  patriotism, fighting for the oppressed, blah blah blah" is just what governments have to say to motivate their citizens to go murder citizens in other nations

Secondly when it comes to the Middle East it almost always comes down to either Israel versus Arab states Or Sunni versus Shia or some kind of mix between those two.


And Sunni versus Shia is really Saudi Arabia  (backed by the West/US) and their allies versus Iran and their allies

So once you see the Syrian conflict in this lens it makes much more sense.

Up to just recently many of these so-called "skeptics" absolutely denied that there was any global warming going on at all. They did the usual obfuscations and cherry picking facts to "prove" there was no global warming.

Then finally the evidence of global warming was so absolutely overwhelming these same "skeptics" suddenly decided that "okay well I guess the earth is warming But people definitely are NOT causing it! Here's some cherry picked facts to prove it!"

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I can't believe the show has float this far under the radar. I'm not hearing any chatter about it all. But let me tell you it's fantastic!

Michelle Dockery, previously seen on Downton Abbey, is an absolute revelation. Perfectly cast as Letty Raines, a thief and con artist who is always one bad decision from implosion. Fresh out of prison, she's attempting to stay afloat. But when she overhears a hit man being hired to kill a man's wife, she sets out to derail the job, sending her on a wild collision course with the killer.

this show is moody, involving, with excellent writing, excellent acting, and plenty of suspenseful action scenes.

I really like that the main character is deeply flawed. This is not a "good guy" who always does the right thing. Rather Lettie is deeply flawed, and yet very very human, and we pull for her despite the fact that she does ssome really really fucked up things.

Seriously, check it out. this is easily TNT's best original show they ever produced. </TEXT>

You desperately need therapy

okay well? How about you address the fact that she was in therapy for a good while and it didn't work. Telling somebody who was in therapy for an extensive period of time and got nothing out of it "you need therapy" is not really helpful.

perhaps address  this fact, and explain to her how and why she didn't get anything out of therapy in the first place and how she can actually get something out of it if she chooses to go again.

otherwise it feels like you didn't even really read the OP

Also, Russell is going to pick apart this secondary like the death Star destroying Tatooine. Yesterday I saw all kinds of open wide receivers, and the either drop the ball or Brock overthrew them by 20 yards. That's not going to happen with Russell.

The Packers only chance is to match them point for point

<TEXT> My boyfriend is a piece of shit

one thing I don't understand about this sub is how quickly people are to label other people literal "pieces of shit". I see here quite often.

Almost all the time it's a man. In fact if you try to use the words b---- or c--- your post will get automatically deleted. But somehow it's okay to run around calling men pieces of shit because they're acting grossly inappropriate in a relationship.

This guy is 23 years old. He's young, stupid, inappropriate, offensive, and just plain wrong. But you know what? People can change. They can grow. Don't get me wrong, OP probably should break up with this guy.

But when you throw people away by calling them human pieces of shit, not only are you breaking the rules of this sub Reddit, you're being incredibly judgmental and dismissive and not giving people room to improve.

So please use other language. I don't think this language is constructive in any way shape or form,and it also says quite a bit about the people using it.

criticize people ACTIONS and WORDS. Don't dismiss them as human beings

<TEXT> Challenging situation! But also a learning opportunity 

I find when you are dealing like people like this, the Bible is your best friend. Logic, reason, appeal to their good side etc. doesn't work for the most part.

So you need to go in armed with multiple Bible verses. Not Bible verses that say "you are wrong, I am right here's why according to the Bible", no. Rather memorize a few Bible verses that encourage them to communicate in a healthy loving manner.

_________________________________________

 Ephesians 5:4 Let there be no filthiness nor foolish talk nor crude joking, which are out of place, but instead let there be thanksgiving. 

Ephesians 4:15  Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ.

Ephesians 4:32
Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you

Proverbs 16:24
Gracious words are like a honeycomb, sweetness to the soul and health to the body. 

_______________________________

For instance you could say "uncle  _______ the word tells us in Ephesians chapter 4 'Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you'. have you forgiven these people you are complaining about right now? if not Why not? can you talk about them in a tenderhearted manner as Paul implores us to?"

Never say "you are wrong because of XYZ" it just won't work. Use the Bible to convict them in their hearts while remaining as neutral as you can emotionally

My annoyance is with people here making out like Hillary Clinton somehow is the grand manipulator of all this shit. These things happen regardless of whether there are Democrats or Republicans in the White House. Doesn't matter.

The military-industrial complex controls the foreign-policy of the US. Completely and totally controls it. The Secretary of State and even the president do what they are told.

<TEXT> the earliest Gospels, Mark and Matthew, date to the 60s A.D.

Now consider Mark was a young man during Jesus's lifetime. Consider Jesus left Earth about 33 A.D. or thereabouts. If Mark was 20  25 years old at that time, he could've been about 50  60 years old when he wrote the gospel.

In other words it's entirely possible the gospel of Mark is a eyewitness account (although at this point we cannot say yes or no for sure). Why would you throw out a potential eyewitness account? and if it wasn't an eyewitness account, it's likely a second person account, which is the same as all of the other accounts of messiahs this person you are conversing with mentions.

At that point he saying "if you eliminate an eyewitness account of Jesus then there is no evidence he existed". Very dishonest. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As somebody who regularly interact with Trump voters I can GUARANTEE you this will be gospel

It's already all over the pro-Trump forums. any time the subject of Hillary winning the popular vote comes up, instantly is flooded with posters adamantly claiming Hillary only won the popular vote because 3 million illegals voted.

This is set in stone in their minds. It's absolute truth. So in the reality these people live in Trump won the popular vote, despite what your personal reality might indicate.

And of course reality is completely malleable. The truth and reality is whatever makes you feel good right now, and whatever reinforces your worldview </TEXT>

Including one hosted by Max Landis, the show runner. Which, weirdly enough, is virtually abandoned except for his own posts

Which one of these is the most active? I would like to discuss the show but I don't want to discuss it when there's only two or three comments per post

Thanks </TEXT>

<TEXT> good grief!

I keep telling you people you can't just sit around getting mad at everything Trump does! That's how he wins! That's how the right-wing lunatics win!

You have to focus on what you believe, focus on your values and what you can do in the real world to manifest those values

There are good things happening out there. Find them and get involved. Post about that on Reddit.com instead of ALWAYS posting about freaking Trump!

The right wing whack jobs has essentially taken over power in this country. There are things we can do about that.  concentrate on those things and start doing it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Somewhere in my comment history I predicted this

The thing is, the right wing media machine is set up to demonize people. It MUST have somebody on the left it can focus all of his rage and hatred on and blame every problem in the universe.

For the last 20 years it's been Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. Now that those two are becoming irrelevant What are they going to do?

Attack Bernie Sanders? He's likable won't work

They have no one left to attack. They destroyed everybody they needed. Now what?

It's going to be very interesting to see what they do. Attacking musk is fucking stupid, nobody wakes up in the morning seething with rage about something he did. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I specifically said another comment that if your protocol feels good, fine. I support. Go for it. I'm all for it. if that's what you want to do, do it.

Just don't call it fasting. Because when you are eating protein pills you are specifically NOT fasting. It's like calling a tree a semi truck. You can call it a semi truck all day long but it's still a tree.

also, it's not "my definition" of fasting, it is the accepted definition of fasting for the last I don't know 5000 or 6000 years of civilization.

Then stop fasting at that point. Problem solved.

Saying "I eat protein pills while fasting" is the same as saying "I threw a book of matches on the fire to help put it out". It's oxymoronic.

But when you are ingesting protein plus other supplements you are not fasting. Just because the thing you are ingesting comes in pill form doesn't mean it somehow doesn't count. </TEXT>

So these people have at their beck and call former black ops, highly trained assassins. And the best these world-class assassins could do was attack this guy on the street in broad daylight (were they could easily be photographed/filmed) and leave his body sprawled on the ground in an obvious assault and murder. Really?

I mean why not roll up in a van, kidnap him, inject him with heroin, then dump his body surreptitiously at night in the heroin district (or whatever you call it LOL).

I mean sure some people will say "he was a good boy he never did drugs something wrong!" But most people will dismiss it and go on with their lives

 sorry not buying it

I'm not claiming they are evil, I am claiming they are just like every other corporation in the world.

The other thing I am claiming is that actual FRAUD does happen when it comes to research and development on new pharmaceuticals. And furthermore that is something that NEVER gets discussed, and never gets reported.

When is the last time you heard somebody in the media declared that a popular medication, scientifically PROVEN to be largely ineffective, was the result of fraud?

Instead it just quietly gets discontinued and nobody ever thinks about it or brings it up. Meanwhile the Corporation pockets millions and millions in profits while providing absolutely no benefit to anybody. </TEXT>

I mean isn't the overriding philosophical approach in pretty much all corporate cultures across the nation and possibly even the world these days that the important thing is money money money, profits profits profits, and valuing people comes in a far far distant 17th or 18th in priority?

<TEXT> I hate this verse so much

It encapsulates exactly why I think this particular aspect of Paul's teachings was so destructive and misguided.

It sets up a war between the body and the spirit, a war you will never ever win. He basically makes an enemy of the body, disassociates from it ("it is no longer I do it, but sin that dwells within me"), and then demands that God rescue him from the horrible fate of living on planet earth with the human body.

Following this philosophy is setting yourself up for a lifetime of self-hatred and torment. This is exactly why Saints in the past have reverted to flagellating themselves when they could not overcome their sinful desires.

Paul has a lot of great things to say, but this particular teaching in my humble opinion is destructive and unproductive.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love your comment.

Basically Donald Trump continuously said and did crazy, malicious, idiotic things on a regular basis. So the media reported that.

Hillary Clinton did far far fewer crazy malicious idiotic things, so the media had fewer things like that to report about her

So people like you look at your feed and say "look how biased this is against Trump! They are trying to get Hillary elected!"

When in fact what you are seeing is an accurate reflection of the reality that Donald Trump said something insane every other day. The problem is that you couldn't accept the fact that the candidate you supported was and still is in TERRIBLE candidate for president </TEXT>

Let's get real. Things are most likely going to get very bad under Pres. Trump. Like really really really bad.

He just hired a fracking billionaire to destroy a whole series of environmental protection measures. He's literally going to wage war on the environment.

they're already talking about dismantling the economic pprotection measures set in place after the 2008 crash. they are setting us up for another crash guarantee.

Bannon is a whack job full of hate and chaos.

People are like "oh come on guys! Is not going to be that bad!"

<TEXT> it's no secret that the Republicans have long desired to slash or even cancel altogether any kind of tax credit for subsidies of solar wind and other clean energy sources.

Given the Republicans control all three branches of the government currently, it's safe to say clean energy subsidies are going to get reduced, big time.

How will companies like Tesla/spaceX/solar city survive this?

-----------------------------------------------------------


http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hy-musk-subsidies-20150531-story.html

Los Angeles entrepreneur Elon Musk has built a multibillion-dollar fortune running companies that make electric cars, sell solar panels and launch rockets into space.

And he's built those companies with the help of billions in government subsidies.

Tesla Motors Inc., SolarCity Corp. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp., known as SpaceX, together have benefited from an estimated $4.9 billion in government support, according to data compiled by The Times. The figure underscores a common theme running through his emerging empire: a public-private financing model underpinning long-shot start-ups.

**"He definitely goes where there is government money," said Dan Dolev, an analyst at Jefferies Equity Research. "That's a great strategy, but the government will cut you off one day."**

The figure compiled by The Times comprises a variety of government incentives, including grants, tax breaks, factory construction, discounted loans and environmental credits that Tesla can sell. It also includes tax credits and rebates to buyers of solar panels and electric cars. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Republicans have a nasty habit of crashing the economy very shortly after getting into power, and people either seem to forget this were never notice it in the first place.

Bush the first crashed the economy almost immediately after taking power. most forget that this was in part caused by a savings-and-loan scam enacted by none other than Neil Bush The president's own brother! that's right, a sitting president's own brother stole $1 billion, helped to crash the economy, and got away with it by paying a $50,000 fine.

http://rationalrevolution0.tripod.com/war/bush_family_and_the_s.htm

http://critcrim.org/potter.htm

the savings-and-loan scam only occurs because of sweeping DEREGULATION of the savings-and-loan industry under Ronald Reagan

Bill Clinton took office and the economy recovereed.

Bush the second took office and promptly crashed the economy in just six or seven years. This was in large part due to Guess what? DEREGULATION of the financial and banking industry under both Clinton and Bush the second.

Barack Obama and the Democrats took over 2008 and the economy recovered (sort of) 

So now we have more Republicans in power. I GUARANTEE you they will figure out how to crash this economy within four years. Mark my words is going to happen. Hell, most of the DEREGULATION they need is already in place!

Grab your nuts boys it's going to be a rough ride

Don't worry, Republicans will succeed in crashing the economy in record time. Bush the first crashed the economy immediately. Bush the second  crashed the economy in six or seven years. I'm sure Trump et al will crash it in his first term.

<TEXT> That's like 1/64 of the story. The ENTIRE media screwed Bernie Sanders.

While Bernie was trying to educate people about his actual platform that contain actual positions on actual issues, the media was busy circle jerking wall-to-wall 24 seven coverage of the Donald Trump Circus.

I remember in the run-up to the Nevada primary they were interviewing voters, and many of them didn't know who Bernie Sanders was or what he stood for. And then the more they became educated about his platform, the more favorable they looked at him. but there was too little coverage and too little education and ultimately the Sanders campaign failed their.

But the media basically REFUSED to make this entire campaign about the issues! the media wanted to make this a reality TV style circus in order to gather short-term ratings. They HATE issues because they're boring and they require actual intelligent people which the talking heads on TV are not

So this is what we get.

He is literally EVERYTHING these down-home rural voters you just described hate. He is literally the type of businessman that lives and breathes to screw these people over!

They've essentially divorced their abusive husband so they could marry their rapist

It's just too bad that they embraced a party that is hell-bent on raping them in the ass over and over and over and over and over and over again. Because that's what Republicans do every time they get in power They economically screw over their base.

See: Kansas.

so yeah good luck with Trump. I GUARANTEE you the economy will be in ruins in four years time </TEXT>

<TEXT> Several people have mentioned schizophrenia, and that's a possibility.

I know multiple people with schizophrenia and to be perfectly frank I think your sister is more likely suffering from some kind of extreme manic phase of bipolar disorder. But I am just an asshole on the Internet, she needs to be evaluated by Dr.

one thing I will say is this- People in this situation are IMMUNE to logic and reason. If you think you're going to sit down and explain to her that she's acting completely wacky and have her understand that and change, well Good luck to you.

The best thing you can do is to continue to tell your sister that you love and care for her and want what is best for her. Whatever you have to do to get her evaluated by a psychiatrist You do that. Whenever white lies or manipulations or this or that you have to do Do it.

Your sister is in danger. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Funny you should ask!

I was just listening to this fascinating interview from a man who was in a car accident and basically crushed. Nearly torn in half. His insides were essentially Jell-O, and even his spine was crushed. He has made merely a complete recovery.

At one point he only had 6 inches or so of his small intestines, and they're supposed to be like 15 feet long. The miracle is that he literally GREW several feet of small intestines which is scientifically impossible to do

Fast-forward to 1:10 (one hour 10 minutes) for the story about his intestines, but the whole interview is absolutely fascinating. He left his body, had a NDE, went through the tunnel of light, talked to God the whole 9 yards

<TEXT> I'm enraged. If I can't get the change I wanted the last 8 years, any change will do, for several reasons.

First of all you should not be getting down voted since your post is perfectly acceptable, although unpopular here

Secondly, what you said here is simply delusional. You will NOT get any kind of significant institutional change with Donald Trump as president. You will not.

Looking at his actual economic policies it's just more of the same right-wing Republican BS, cut taxes on the wealthy and screw the middle class that we've been seeing for decades from this party.

 He's not going to  "blow anything up" or cause the system to come crashing down or any of this other nonsensical ridiculous stuff you people believe is going to happen.

Trump will do what he always does, he will screw people over left and right and leave a wake of angry people in his path. Meanwhile with control of the House, Senate and presidency the Republicans will push through all of the truly awful horrible policies they've been salivating at the mouth to push through for years and years. and all of you Trump voters will get royally screwed bbecause this is what the Republicans ALWAYS do economically, they screw over their base.

I'm sorry but you people believe a lie. Which is exactly what this article is trying to explain to you and you just don't get it. </TEXT>

Theory

Arnold is not dead. Arnold faked his death, possibly using a robot body double, so that he could enter into the simulated world completely.

In fact, Arnold is Wyatt.

 Ford suspects something along these lines because he specifically asked Dolores when her last contact with Arnold was. Why would he ask her that if he knew there was no way there could be any more contact after Arnold's death?

<TEXT> the two movies share a nearly identical plot structure, and at least one nearly identical character

Observe

* a super evil big bad guy who wants to kill everybody/destroy the universe

beyond: check
guardians: check

* a weapon conveniently exists that will allow the super evil big bad guy to do exactly that

Beyond: check
guardians: check

* However! This weapon is missing one key element to make it fully functional. Super evil big bad guy must find this element so he can activate the weapon

Beyond: check
guardians: check

* a small group of good guys band together  to stop the super evil big bad guy from destroying the universe/killing everybody

Beyond: check
guardians: check

* An interspecies romance occurs involving Zoe Saldana

Beyond: check
guardians: check

* ample use of old-school pop rock music. Very unusual for a sci-fi movie.

Beyond: check
guardians: check

* Lots of high-powered action interspersed with lighthearted comedy

Beyond: check
guardians: check

* In the end the big evil bad guy finds the missing part of the weapon, puts the weapon together, and actually begins to deploy the weapon that will kill everybody/destroy the universe.

Beyond: check
guardians: check

* In the end of course the big evil bad guy and the lead actors/protagonist must face off mano a mano, alone, man-to-man. (in TV tropes this is called "alone with the psycho"). And of course the good guy wins, deactivates the weapon that's going to kill everybody/destroy the universe, and the big evil bad guy is destroyed.

I mean honestly movies these days or soooooooo formulaic, predictable,  and they all resemble each other.

Simon Pegg wrote this movie, and quite frankly he is a much better writer than this. I don't know what happened.

If you want to watch some absolutely great, original, fascinating sci-fi the check out HBO's Westworld. Sci-fi movies and superhero movies are basically now the same genre, and quite frankly it's kkind of boring.

<TEXT> getting a little tired of hearing about how "Republican Party is dying" on this website all the time

MOST of the governors of this country are Republican 

MOST of those state legislators are Republican dominated

The house is Republican majority and will stay that way for The next 10 to 20 years? I don't know

The Senate is currently Republican majority  and may or may not stay that way right now. Projections for 2018 show it will likely swing Republican either way

And thanks to gerrymandering, and the fact that poor white Americans consistently vote against their own best interests, this is likely to stay this way for the foreseeable future

The Republican Party is NOT dying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ah! Not necessarily true

Eschenbach's source is Kyot, a mysterious French poet who originally got the story from Muslim contacts and later traveled throughout Europe researching the tale

Eschenbach's version of the story is definitely Muslim influenced, and that's what sets his version apart from all the others which are amalgamations of Christian and pagan/Celtic myths

<TEXT> if you read the Wikipedia entries on the holy Grail, the Fisher King, Wolfram von Eschenbach, Robert DeBoron and Chrtien de Troyes that is a great start. I used to have multiple books on the holy Grail that I've lost most of them, so unfortunately I can't give you many book recommendations

the Grail and Camelot myths are the perfect synthesis of pagan/Celtic mythology and Christian mysticism. It really is equal parts both. To understand the Grail myth you really need to look and study Celtic myth, as well as Christian symbology

<TEXT> fun facts

In the very earliest telling of the holy Grail myth, the Grail is in fact NOT a cup! according to Wolfram von Eschenbach's telling of the story,  the Grail was a stone (called lapis exillis) that fell from Heaven that was associated with the neutral Angels. These were Angels that sided with neither heaven nor hell in Lucifer's rebellion.

in one telling of the tale the stone is referred to as a black stone. Which is fascinating because at the center of Islam's holiest place, the kabaa, sits a black stone.

The first mention of the Grail being a cup was by Chrtien de Troyes. In this telling of the myth the questing knight Perceval finally finds the Magic Castle where witnesses the sacred procession of the Grail King, also referred to as the Fisher King.

During this procession there are several sacred objects presented, including the spear that dealt the deathblow to Jesus on the cross. One of the sacred object is referred to as "a Grail", which meant a saucer or a cup.  Note that it says "A" Grail, NOT "the" Grail. At that point in the myth it was just one of several sacred objects associated with the Grail King.

It was only later that it became "the" Grail, and as the myth progressed the Grail became more prominent and gained more and more redemptive/transformative powers.

There is also a whole other myth regarding the Spear, but that's another story for another time.

<TEXT> I will preface this by saying yes OBVIOUSLY you consult with your doctor before taking any supplements

Having said that, there are supplements that have been shown to induce neurogenesis, which is the birth of new neurons is what you need to heal from a TBI

DHA/EPA-in omega-3 essential fatty acid that is absolutely CRITICAL for too many brain and nerve functions to mention. The best brand by far is Nordic naturals

B vitamins-get the methylated version, Jarrow brand is awesome.

Thiamine (vitamin B1)-on top of a multi-b you need extra vitamin B1. The best is allithiamine, which is a fat-soluble version of thiamine.

Lions mane mushroom - scientifically proven to stimulate new nerve growth. Google it.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23510212

DHEA - an over-the-counter readily available hormone that has been scientifically proven to stimulate neurogenesis. Best thing to do was ask your doctor for a blood test to see where your levels are now

those videos are pretty interesting actually. You should watch them.

This Democratic operative basically says "the Trump rally crowd is so full of unstable wing nuts that all we have to do to get some kind of violent conflagration to breakout is send somebody in with a Planned Parenthood T-shirt"

I mean they were definitely sending people to the rallies with the intention of causing trouble. It's just that the crowd is so full of crazy people it makes their job really easy.

Also that guy got fired the next day.

And fine They do good things! Great.

The point is that it is still a pay to play organization which allows foreign governments to pay bribes to the Secretary of State, soon to be president, of the United States of America. That's not okay. That is not a good thing.

The fact that they also happen to do good things is awesome, but it doesn't detract from my point.

However!

The Clinton foundation is possibly the most corrupt political entity in America. I am not joking. And no I am not a Donald "unhinged lunatic racist rapist" Trump supporter.

the Clinton foundation has taken bribery to the next level. It's made bribery international. Is just not pay to play for American corporations, now it's pay to play for international corporations and foreign governments!

Think about that! If Saudi Arabia wants a favor from Sec./President Clinton, all they have to do was make a nice juicy "donation" (i.e. bribe!) To the Clinton foundation and Voil! Suddenly they get a nice juicy favor

I mean  Qatar "gifted" Bill Clinton $1 million for his birthday (recent WikiLeaks). You think they did that out of the goodness of their heart? They expect a favor in return for that!

I'm telling you we are electing an extraordinarily corrupt president and things are not going to go well for us.

As the law currently exist right now all of that is perfectly and completely legal. does it indicate  that corruption is very likely going on? Of course. But you don't prosecute on "indicators"

In order for it to be treason they would need a document saying "here is $1 million payment to Bill Clinton. In exchange I fully expect the US government to do  ____________ for me and/or my organization and/or my government etc."

being close to a bomb blast, even if you suffer absolutely no physical injuries, begins a long slow process of literally turning your brain to mush. During this process you literally lose your mind, and right now there's absolutely nothing we can do about it.

People keep saying that us liberals are "condescending" towards Trump supporters, and we should try to be more understanding of where they're coming from.

But when these people keep saying and believing patently provably stupid things What am I supposed to think?

she is saying "Donald Trump acts like a emotionally disturbed child and that does not bother me"

I'm supposed to pretend that's not a fantastically stupid thing to believe and say? I'm condescending because I look at that and think "for the love of Thor! These dumb people scare the shit out of me!" </TEXT>

In reality these people love war. They love the thought of murdering lots of people in large numbers. Especially brown people, especially Muslim brown people.

If they had a chance to press a button and nuke Tehran, they would. In a heartbeat. And then they would slap themselves on the back in congratulations.

they are bloodthirsty, and scary. And Trump knows EXACTLY what he's doing by riling them up with warmongering braggadocious rhetoric </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, gobekli tepe is so far the most ancient evidence of an advanced civilization we have ever found

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe

One of the prominent features of the site are large stone circles, with carvings of animals like serpents and lions on them. But for some weird reason these circles were regularly buried and then built back on top of.

Why?


http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/06/gobekli-tepe/mann-text

For reasons yet unknown, the rings at Gbekli Tepe seem to have regularly lost their power, or at least their charm. Every few decades people buried the pillars and put up new stonesa second, smaller ring, inside the first. Sometimes, later, they installed a third. Then the whole assemblage would be filled in with debris, and an entirely new circle created nearby. The site may have been built, filled in, and built again for centuries.

Bewilderingly, the people at Gbekli Tepe got steadily worse at temple building. The earliest rings are the biggest and most sophisticated, technically and artistically. As time went by, the pillars became smaller, simpler, and were mounted with less and less care. Finally the effort seems to have petered out altogether by 8200 B.C. Gbekli Tepe was all fall and no rise. </TEXT>

oh right it also cost a few trillion dollars

and many people were perfectly willing to vote for Bush's brother for president.

Most people in America have no qualms killing people by the hundreds of thousands or even by the millions. It just doesn't bother them

These people FANTASIZE and MENTALLY MASTURBATE to the idea of using nuclear bombs on the people we currently dislike. This is an awesome idea to them!

There are literally no downsides. Remember, Muslims are essentially evil. They worship Satan and are going to hell anyway so why not send them their little bit sooner? 

You've never heard of these type of people say "let's turn Tehran into a glass parking lot!"? You think they're joking? They are not. They are serious.

My question to you is How the fuck could you be confused about this?

Bush Cheney enacted a psychopathic campaign of lies in order to start a war that killed 500,000 innocent men women and children and enriched Cheney's bank account. Most of these people have no problem with that war

That's how morally bankrupt they are.

<TEXT> Jesus Christ himself only gave one account of the judgment. And that was in the parable of the sheep and the goats.

The upshot of that parable is that if you are kind to other people, if you help other people when they are in need, if you go out of your way to provide assistance for those who need it, if you are NOT a completely narcissistic self absorbed douche bag Then you are going to heaven. It's that simple.

Yes I know a lot of  Christians disagree with me. I don't care. Jesus Christ himself said your fate after this lifetime is based on how you treat your fellow man, and it is NOT based on your belief system.

Your wife sounds like an absolutely wonderful human being. Unlike other people on this board, I am 100% convinced your wife is in heaven waiting for you and you will be reunited with her when you die. That's how I see it.

My condolences, I certainly hope you find comfort

Matthew 25

31 When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne. 32 All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 33 He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.

34 Then the King will say to those on his right, Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. 35 For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, 36 I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.

37 Then the righteous will answer him, Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? 38 When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? 39 When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?

40 The King will reply, Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.

41 Then he will say to those on his left, Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. 42 For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, 43 I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.

44 They also will answer, Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?

45 He will reply, Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.

46 Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life. </TEXT>

What, exactly, do these critics think would have happened? They need to answer the question, "What if we had done nothing?"

oh give me a break with this shit!

Saudi Arabia has been BOMBING Yemen for the last few weeks. Killing women and children and other innocent civilians. NOBODY in America or Europe has made a stink about it. Nobody.

You know why? Because they are our allies. So it's okay.

But when somebody we don't like does the exact same thing that is all of a sudden we start hyperventilating "OMG! We have to do something about this! Won't somebody think of the chiiiiiiiiiildren!" 

we don't care about children dying. We don't care about innocent civilians dying. We just care about the global sociopolitical chess game and how to get an upper hand in it.

Let's stop deluding ourselves about what we really care about

if you really want to know "What if we had done nothing?", Well then look at Yemen because we are doing nothing.

They did in Iran in the 1950s when they overthrew democratically elected government and set the stage for Islamic radicals to take over that country, they did it in Cambodia where they supported Pol Pot who turned out to be one of the worst people in the history of the universe. they did it in Chile in the 1970s when they assassinated Salvador allende and threw their support behind general Pinochet who just happened to prove himself to be one of the worst people in human history.

It was a foreign-policy disaster all the way around.

for those down voting me, this is from Col. Qaddafi's Wikipedia page

Supporters praised Gaddafi's administration for the creation of an almost classless society through domestic reform.[351] They stress the regime's achievements in combating homelessness and ensuring access to food and safe drinking water. Highlighting that under Gaddafi, all Libyans enjoyed free education to a university level, they point to the dramatic rise in literacy rates after the 1969 revolution.[351] Supporters have also applauded achievements in medical care, praising the universal free healthcare provided under the Gaddafist administration, with diseases like cholera and typhoid being contained and life expectancy raised.[351] Biographers Blundy and Lycett believed that under the first decade of Gaddafi's leadership, life for most Libyans "undoubtedly changed for the better" as material conditions and wealth drastically improved

From 1969 to 1973, the RCC introduced social welfare programs funded with oil money, which led to house-building projects and improved healthcare and education.[75] In doing so, they greatly expanded the public sector, providing employment for thousands.[75]

Compulsory education was expanded from 6 to 9 years old, while adult literacy programs and free university education were implemented; Beida University was founded, while Tripoli University and Benghazi University were expanded.[76] These early social programs proved popular within Libya.[77]

<TEXT> there's long been many conspiracy theories regarding pedophilia abuses and coverups by those in high levels of government, both in America and Europe and several other countries.

Interesting case here which revealed at least 61 former students from the 70s and 80s testifying regarding widespread sexual abuse of students at a prep school for the elite and rich in Rhode Island.

https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/09/01/stgeorges/4so7ElWQwjTsnDkv5eI3NJ/story.html

After a months-long investigation of sexual abuse at St. Georges School, a report released Thursday described the elite Rhode Island prep school in the 1970s and 80s as a cauldron of sexual exploitation of students.

Sixty-one alumni gave investigators first-hand accounts of the abuse they say they suffered, with 51 saying the abusers were faculty or staff and an additional 10 reporting abuse by classmates. Two staff members abused at least one student every year they worked at St. Georges.

The picture that emerges from this investigation is profoundly disturbing, wrote attorney Martin F. Murphy in a preface to the 390-page report. Murphy, a partner at the Boston firm Foley Hoag, was appointed in January by St. Georges and the victims group SGS for Healing to investigate sex abuse at the school in Middletown, R.I. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Pamela Hupp case just got even more bizarre. She's being charged with first-degree murder and an attempt to frame Russ Faria </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-24 04:27:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> for those who don't know Pamela  hupp, she is one of the most coldly calculating despicable people I've ever run across. And the worst part of it is that her main enablers and unwitting accomplices were her local police department.

Here is the background on her

https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/42b2l1/anybody_watch_dateline_last_night_i_swear_to_god/

TLDR: Russ Faria's wife is found murdered. Pamela was the last person to see her alive, and his wife recently changed her will to make Pamela the sole beneficiary.

Pamela pointed the finger at Ross, and the police ignored the mountain of evidence against Pamela and instead try to railroad this poor man for his own wife's murder which he was CLEARLY innocent of. A real tragedy, the kind of case that makes you want to punch the prosecutor in the face.

Anyway she's been recently arrested for first-degree murder.

http://www.nbcnews.com/dateline/prosecutor-charges-pam-hupp-1st-degree-murder-alleges-attempt-frame-n636841



Pam Hupp has been charged with first-degree murder and armed criminal action in the August 16 shooting death of Louis Gumpenberger, 33, a man she told police was burglarizing her O'Fallon, Missouri home when she killed him. The charges were announced Tuesday at a press conference with the O'Fallon Police Department and Prosecuting Attorney Tim Lohmar.
Dateline NBC

Hupp had been the state's key witness in the case against Russ Faria, who was convicted in 2013 of murdering his wife in 2011. Hupp was the last known person to see Betsy Faria alive before she was stabbed to death in her home in late December 2011. Four days before the murder, Hupp had become the beneficiary of a $150,000 life insurance policy that Betsy owned. It was a change that no other friend or family member knew about. Hupp uncorroborated allegations about Russ, who became the only suspect in the case. 

[Snip]

 But the prosecutor said there appears to be a connection between the Faria case and the charges Hupp now faces.

According to police, Hupp called 911 at 12:08 p.m. on August 16, to report an active break-in at her home. While on the phone, she told 911 that she had shot the intruder. Gumpenberger was pronounced dead at the scene. He was later identified by his fingerprints, as he had no identification on his person. However, $900 and a note were found in Gumpenberger's pant pockets. According to the probable cause statement, included with the charging document against Hupp, the note "appeared to be instructions for Gumpenberger to kidnap Hupp, get Russ's money from Hupp at her bank, and kill Hupp in order to collect the rest of the $10,000." The name Faria was also on the note, authorities said.

Search Resumes for Nazi Gold Train That Might Not Even Exist

By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSAUG. 16, 2016, 7:39 A.M. E.D.T.

WARSAW, Poland  Explorers in Poland began digging Tuesday for a legendary Nazi train said to be laden with treasure and armaments.

They're not dissuaded by decades of fruitless searches, a scientific determination that no train is there and warnings by historians that such a train might have never even existed.

The search in southwestern Poland attests to the power of a local legend claiming a Nazi "gold train" disappeared in a mountain tunnel as the Germans escaped the advancing Soviet army at the end of World War II. </TEXT>

<TEXT> holy crap I just can't stand it anymore!

I'm telling you right now there has NEVER been more quality TV shows to watch than there is right here right now. Never. I'm almost 50 years old. Let me tell you growing up we had three, maybe four options of things to watch on any given night and they were usually cheesy and stupid and dumb. 

Some stupid sitcom, or some horrible soap opera like Dallas, or a different god-awful sitcom, or some fantastically cheesy cop drama, or whatever. Lots and lots and lots of crap

Today? Incredible choices! One great show after another after another. Better call Saul, preacher, orphan black, banshee, Mr. robot, game of thrones, stranger things, etc. etc. so many great shows out there!

And yet what I see time after time are both critics and casual fans whining and bitching and moaning and complaining and nitpicking about all of these great shows.

"Well you know preacher started out good, then by the third episode it wasn't so great, but then one quarter of the way through the fourth episode started getting good again, but then 5/8 through the fourth episode I got to tell you it's that started dragging for me and I just don't think that it just didn't quite have the quality of the first 3/5 of the episode and bla bla bla bla......"

Good grief people! If I could take you whiny bitches and transport you back to the 80s and force you to watch primetime TV you would come back weeping and whaling, clutching my clothes, your entire world shaken to its core, promising never again to complain about TV quality today.

And Mr. Robot is still great! Second season is fantastic I love it and everybody who's whining and bitching about how it's too slow or whatever can kiss my ass!

<TITLE> Parabiosis (Young blood therapy) looks VERY promising. We are about 1015 years away from a legitimate viable rejuvenation therapy. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-10 18:13:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> parabiosis is using young blood to rejuvenate older organisms. Of all of the longevity therapies I've researched this one seems to have the most promise, as well as the most realistic actual science going on.

Studies done on mice and rats showed that when plasma is taken from young mice and injected into older mice, the older mice experienced a 400% increase in new neuron growth in the hippocampus area of the brain. These results were published in the journal nature

http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v20/n6/full/nm.3569.html

buoyed by results like these, the first human trial of young blood therapy is underway by a company called ambrosia. 

https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602080/the-next-health-fad-blood-transfusions-from-young-people/

Ambrosia is planning on giving 600 patients four rounds of weekly blood infusions coming from 16- to 25-year-olds. Ambrosia founder Jesse Karmazin, who went to Stanford Medical School, said in an e-mail that he was inundated with interview requests and unable to speak today.

The pay-to-play nature of Ambrosias trial has draw criticism from some researchers, according to Science, and is reminiscent of recent news highlighting the surge in unproven stem-cell clinics that require their patients to pay for clinical trials that may never see data published. The Ambrosia clinical trial lists over 100 blood biomarkers it plans to measure before and one month after the transfusions, but David Glass, executive director of aging research at Novartis, says that because the trial has no placebo control group, it will be impossible to decipher any benefits from it.

More info on that here

http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/peter-thiel-wants-to-inject-himself-with-young-peoples-blood

but realistically the best hope is not simply injecting Young blood into older people, but rather it's the proteins in the young blood.

This researcher here notes there are 700 proteins in blood. Several of those proteins have the ability to program the body to literally rejuvenate itself. Once those proteins identified they can then be filtered out and administered to older patients. This process is probably going to take 10 to 20 years.

https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/aug/04/can-we-reverse-ageing-process-young-blood-older-people

Wagers picked out one factor, known as GDF11, as a rejuvenating protein in young blood. In Villedas most recent paper, published in July 2015, he found a second factor, B2M, which peaks in the blood of old mice, as it does in old humans: when injected into young mice, B2M impairs their memories.

The studies all point in one direction. Among the hundreds of substances found in blood are proteins that keep tissues youthful, and proteins that make them more aged. Wyss-Coray has a hypothesis: when we are born, our blood is awash with proteins that help our tissues grow and heal. In adulthood, the levels of these proteins plummet. The tissues that secrete them might produce less because they get old and wear out, or the levels might be suppressed by an active genetic programme. Either way, as these pro-youthful proteins vanish from the blood, tissues around the body start to deteriorate. The body responds by releasing pro-inflammatory proteins, which build up in the blood, causing chronic inflammation that damages cells and accelerates ageing.

Alkahests ultimate goal  to identify the key proteins in plasma that rejuvenate or age human tissues and then manufacture a product that uses them  could take 10 to 15 years. In the near term, the company has another strategy. Earlier this year, the Spanish blood products firm, Grifols, pledged $37.5m for a 45% stake in Alkahest. With another $12.5m, the company will bankroll more research in exchange for rights to Alkahests first products. Over the next two years, Alkahest will take human plasma and divide it into fractions that are rich in different proteins. Each fraction will then be tested in mice to see if they boost brain function. Any that do will be swiftly introduced into human trials and developed into the first generation of products.

<TEXT> generally speaking I think we have too many people in prison in this country. Many of them for petty offenses.

But holy shit! This guy went on a multi-year break in and burglary spree which included holding a 19-year-old lady at gunpoint and also physically assaulting another homeowner. Judge notes that he had lots of positive support in his life and still did this

four years? That's it? That seems crazy to me

http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/crime-and-courts/madison-man-gets-years-prison-for-residential-burglary-spree/article_ef02f691-30eb-5458-96cc-acd7cbabdb58.html

A Madison man was sentenced Monday to four years in prison for a long series of residential break-ins that happened mostly on Madisons West Side in late 2014 and early 2015, including one in which a 90-year-old woman was held at gunpoint.

Dane County Circuit Judge David Flanagan told Jamal A. Scott, 22, that even if Scott could round up all of the stolen valuables and items that had sentimental value and return them to their owners, he couldnt change the enduring feeling of victimization that those people feel.

Some couldnt return to live in their homes again, Flanagan said, while others have said they still dont feel safe in them.

Flanagan also said that given the amount of positive support that Scott has had in his life, from family, clergy and community mentors, he couldnt understand how Scotts burglary spree continued unabated.

But it ended on April 3, 2015. That day, Scott and Jeffrey D. Harrison, 21, broke into the home of a 90-year-old woman. For a half-hour, Flanagan said, Scott rummaged through the womans home, looking for valuables, while Harrison held a gun toward her head in her bedroom.

There had been some dispute over which man held the gun, but the womans description of that man made it more likely that it was Harrison, who was much thinner than Scott. Flanagan said it didnt matter to him.

On some level, it must have bothered you to see a 90-year-old woman afraid in her bed, Flanagan said. But it didnt. You went out and did it again.

That day, Scott and Harrison broke into another home, where Harrison got into a struggle with the homeowner and was arrested. Scott fled but was arrested later.

Harrison was sentenced on July 1 to 8 years in prison.

Deputy District Attorney Matthew Moeser said he didnt believe Scott truly accepted responsibility for what he did, because he said he was high on Xanax at the time and didnt remember the crimes. He asked for a 14-year prison sentence. Scott insisted in court that he accepts responsibility, and that what he did was wrong. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Finally saw "Mulholland Drive" (David Lynch). Many (including Roger Ebert) consider it bizarre and ultimately inexplicable. I found it rather straightforward. What? </TITLE>

<TEXT> many consider David Lynch's Mulholland Drive to be completely mysterious and utterly inexplicable. This includes Roger Ebert who said

http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/lost-on-mulholland-drive
In short: "Mulholland Drive" resists, defies and finally defeats logical explanation. It is impossible to produce a consistent precis of the film that accounts for everything. And there is an admirable reason for this: Like a dream, it does not have to make sense.

personally I found it pretty straightforward.

There is a scene when Diane (Naomi Watts) is at dinner at the director's house. She is talking to the director's mother about her life. She explains that she's from a small town in Canada, moved to Hollywood, had a rich aunt who died and left her money, she tried to break into the movies, she really really wanted the lead part in a specific movie but instead went to Camilla.

After that Camilla helped her get smaller parts in various movies but ultimately she didn't have a lot of success.

In my opinion all of that is true. None of that is a dream. All of that happened in real life.

The other thing that happened in real life is that Diane and Camilla started a torrid sex affair. For Diane it was true love. For Camilla it was nothing but a good time. In fact Camilla took delight in flaunting her other relationships in Diane's face including her relationship with the director. This happens when her and the director here sitting in the car and the director demands the set to be cleared but Camilla insists Diane can stay. Camilla then begins making out with the director in front of Diane.

When Camilla and the director announced their engagement at the dinner, Diane has reached a breaking point. her career has failed, her aunt is dead, the only person she cares about treats her cruelly, and possibly she is a junkie. I'm unclear on that however.

So she hires a hitman to kill Camilla. The hitman shows her a blue key and says the blue key will show up at a specific place when the deed is done.

Again All of this happens in the real world.

Back in her apartment, Diane sees the blue key sitting on the table. She knows the deed is done.

Even though the movie is not edited this way, CHRONOLOGICALLY speaking this is when the first scene of the movie takes place with Camilla riding in the car and the men in the car attempting to kill her. THIS SCENE is a DREAM.

this is Diane's flight from reality, and the way in which she imagines she can be reunited with her true love Camilla who she has in the real world just had killed.

in the dream world Diane is named Betty. Everything in the dream world is reversed for her.

In the real world Diane is a failed actress. In the dream world Betty's aunt is not just rich, she is incredibly well-connected and these well-connected people pull strings to make sure that Betty becomes successful actress.

The entire sequence with Betty arriving in LA, encountering the two weird old people, moving into her hands apartment, encountering a amnesia stricken Camilla, the director being forced to cast Betty in the role, the cowboy, investigating Camilla's real identity etc. All of that is a dream.

Again in the real world Betty wants to be Camilla. In the dream world Camilla wants to be Betty and goes so far as to make up her face and get a way to look like Betty/Diane.

Ultimately the dream ends/collapses, and Diane kills herself. 

Again, I think the movie is pretty straightforward. I don't really see how it's "utterly inexplicable" like some people think.

<TITLE> Ball lightning is a bizarre phenomenon, and can Even float through walls. Scientists have struggled to explain it. Now a new theory says it's the result of lightning accelerating electrons to near light speed. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-25 00:42:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ball lightning has fascinated researchers for decades, although many scientists have insisted is nothing but an urban myth.

These balls of light, resembling plasma spheres, appear during thunderstorms and can slowly move through the landscape and even go through walls.

Wikipedia actually does a great job of explaining it. Below that part of an article which describes the latest theory on how ball lightning is formed 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_lightning

Ball lightning is an unexplained atmospheric electrical phenomenon. The term refers to reports of luminous, spherical objects which vary from pea-sized to several meters in diameter. Though usually associated with thunderstorms, it lasts considerably longer than the split-second flash of a lightning bolt. Many early reports say that the ball eventually explodes, sometimes with fatal consequences, leaving behind the odor of sulfur.[1][2]

Until the 1960s, most scientists argued that ball lightning was not a real phenomenon but an urban myth, despite numerous reports from throughout the world.[3] Laboratory experiments can produce effects that are visually similar to reports of ball lightning, but how these relate to the natural phenomenon remains unclear.

Scientists have proposed many hypotheses about ball lightning over the centuries. Scientific data on natural ball lightning are scarce, owing to its infrequency and unpredictability. The presumption of its existence depends on reported public sightings, and has therefore produced somewhat inconsistent findings. Due to inconsistencies and to the lack of reliable data, the true nature of ball lightning remains unknown.[4] The first ever optical spectrum of what appears to have been a ball-lightning event was published in January 2014 and included a video at high frame-rate.

http://www.skyvalleychronicle.com/BREAKING-NEWS/NEW-THEORY-EXPLAINING-RARE-PHENOMENON-OF-BALL-LIGHTNING-MAY-ACCOUNT-FOR-SOME-UFO-SIGHTINGS-2533765

(INTERNATIONAL) -- A new theory about how the rare phenomena of "ball lightning" forms, and the strange propetrties of movement and transformation it displays after formation, may account for some or many UFO sightings.

[snip]

Wu believes his theory has solved the question of how ball lightning forms, and why it exhibits some very unusual properties such as the ability to float through walls or to suddenly appear inside the cabin of a jetliner.

The theory states that ball lightning is formed when lightning strikes generate a "plasma bubble". The bubble is formed this way: as a "regular" lightning bolt reaches the ground, it accelerates electrons rapidly - close to the speed of light - and that causes them in turn to release intense microwave radiation which then "charges the air," resulting in a "spherical plasma bubble" that then traps the radiation for a period of time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Elliott is holding a bright red phone. Very unusual color for a phone to be. Not to mention it's an old school handset phone.

Old school handset phones remind me of the matrix.

notice how the phone call is Elliott reconnecting back into the virtual world, the real world so speak.

Anyway the red phone reminds me of the choice Neo has to make between the red pill and the blue pill. I think that scene is Elliott choosing the red pill

The red pill and its opposite, the blue pill, are popular culture symbols representing the choice between embracing the sometimes painful truth of reality (red pill) and the blissful ignorance of illusion (blue pill).

The terms, popularized in science fiction culture, are derived from the 1999 film The Matrix. In the film, the main character Neo is offered the choice between a red pill and a blue pill. The blue pill would allow him to remain in the fabricated reality of the Matrix, therefore living the "ignorance of illusion", while the red pill would lead to his escape from the Matrix and into the real world, therefore living the "truth of reality" even though it is a harsher, more difficult life. </TEXT>

so apparently several ancient Roman and Greek historians claimed that the Phoenicians, more specifically the Carthaginians, practiced institutionalized ritual infant sacrifice.

But many modern historians dismiss these claims as nothing but war propaganda.

In the video they interview 2 Harvard professors who claim that new archaeological evidence shows these sacrifices most likely did happen.

However, they also interviewed in Italian professor who was very very adamant that no human sacrifices ever occurred in the Phoenician culture and it's all just bad propaganda

http://www.nderf.org/NDERF/NDE_Experiences/bobby_r_nde.htm



 I was 4 years old.  As I recall it was in the summer or fall. I had been having difficulty breathing and in the evening I was taken to the emergency room by my mother and father. This wasn't unusual; I averaged a trip to the hospital at least once every two weeks. On one occasion I distinctly remember listening to a doctor advising my parents to stop caring for me and to let me die, telling that I was not worth taking care of due to the extremeness of my asthma and would be dead by the time I was age 9.

Anyway, I was laying on an examination table, my parents were to the left of me. The door to the room was closed and I was in extreme pain. Every breath felt like burning razors were tearing through my lungs and throat. I don't remember the moment, I stopped breathing; only, all of the pain stopped and I found myself in a vast place.

The air, if you could call it that, was filled with an unearthly white light. The place seemed to expand for all eternity.  I do remember a being of light, God, standing near me. It was looming over me like a great tower of strength, yet radiating only warmth and love. Its first words sent a shock through me, 'Bobby, I'm sorry for the pain this meeting will cause you. When I created the Universe, I put rules and limitations in place. Every time you come here, it changes you, because this is your second time here.  You will remember more than you're supposed to, and it will cause you more pain than you know. You will suffer as no one in your family ever has, and I can't change that.' As those words were spoken, if that's what you could call them, I caught glimpses of my life and felt pride, love, joy, and sadness, all pouring into me. Each images was of me, but from the standpoint of a being standing with me or looking on.

I remember the conversation going on for an eternity, but in reality it only lasted a minute or two at the most. I remember a white light that seemed to pulsate and understanding that it was some kind of extension of God.  It stored the moments of every moment and life.  It allowed a mortal to experience them. If I was to label this, I would call it the Book of Fate, that contains all that has, is, and will be.

Somehow I felt the light from that device and God merge to become one with me. I saw my life, all 128 years of it. I saw my mother die, and me being unable to do anything about it as I had moved away. I saw my sister struggling with depression and worse due to a rape she experienced in her mid 20's. I saw my father die a few years after my mother. I saw a home I'd built for my family, in a place halfway across the country,.  This home was far away from my home.  I also experienced the final moments of my mortal life. I was in a bed, I don't know where, my children and grandchildren were there with me. I remember thinking, 'It's finally done.' I remember feeling a horrible wave of sadness rip through me as I thought of my daughter who had died before me, and then I remember thinking of my wife. (Keep in mind I was 4 years old while experiencing the life experiences of an 128 year old man)  I remembered the night we were married, the room was dimly lit and she was standing in front of me getting undressed. I remember seeing a strand of gray in her hair and then looking back on that moment, realizing how in that moment I had been reborn and everything was worth it. Then I realized I'd be able to see her and my daughter again, and gave into death for the final time.

That wasn't the end though, I was shown the consequences of my life, thousands of people that I'd interacted with and felt what they felt about me, saw their life and how I had impacted them. Next I saw the consequences of my life and the influence of my actions. I saw people reading my books, teaching lessons to children that I had taught them.

I remember waking up confused and trying to deal with everything. For a long time afterwards I struggled to deal with what I saw, every time my mom got sick, I wondered if it was time for her to die. I tried to always be strong, and in time eventually came to blame myself for my mother's oncoming death and sister's oncoming rape. I couldn't deal with the things I had experienced and it took nearly 29 years after this before I could begin to stop blaming myself and accept that I had nothing to do with those things.

At the time of this writing, my sister was raped years ago, she got pregnant and then had a miscarriage. My mom had Alzheimer and stage 7 dementia, and is not expected to last another year. She entered the final stage about the same time I signed up with Teach For America and ended up half way across the country. My father is preparing for my mother's death and working on finding his final home, before it's his turn to die. As for me, I've been teaching for 14 years and have worked with nearly 10,000 children. I've also begun to write a book and the occasional article. I now live halfway across the country and have begun to consider dating.

(Further down the page as an answer to a question he posts this)

 I saw what humanity becomes, and my part in helping that to occur. All I'll say is that we don't go extinct, kill ourselves, or destroy ourselves. It still terrifies and feels me with joy, love and contentment. As a species, we're not remotely ready for that knowledge and I'll take it to my grave. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb 2 down the middle of the great street of the city. On each side of the river stood the tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations. 

Okay so the text says "the tree of life" (singular) stood on "each side" of the river. 

Does that mean a single tree was growing up above the River somehow roots on either side? Like the tree straddled the River?

or maybe in this context "the tree of life" could be thought of as a species of tree. And there could be many trees of life all of the same variety growing all over the new Jerusalem.

Also, I'm not a literalist. I fully understand that interpreting the book of the Revelation is challenging and I don't think anybody has an absolute solid 100% correct answer.

I would just like to hear what other people say about this, as I think it's fun to think about </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> the new Central Park is an awesome park but it's rather bland, and very much underutilized

My idea is to turn maybe one third of it into a miniature urban forest. This would be the part on the far end opposite the skate park (near Brearley Street).

You would plant trees, but with enough space in between the trees to walk and/or sit and/or have a picnic. The idea would be that as the trees mature eventually the canopies of the trees would all merge together.

 Perhaps have one  small clearing within the miniature forest, perfect for a picnic. All of the walking paths currently there would remain untouched.

What do you think?

<DATE> 2016-03-16 23:27:24 </DATE>

<TEXT> first of all this was a better movie than I thought it would be. Totally worth seeing!

Secondly the ending was a bit confusing to me, and perhaps I just missed something really obvious? I don't know. Feel free to point out if I am being an idiot

Two things about the ending

1. So these mimics are incredibly intelligent, with insane reaction speeds, and even seem to be able to affect time and space.

But when Tom Cruise drops a bunch of hand grenades on the Omega, it eats it up like it's a delicious snack. How stupid is that? Why doesn't it realize they are hand grenades and don't eat that?

2. At the very end Tom cruise goes back to being a major, and everybody acts very deferential to him. In this timeline is he considered a hero of the war? If so how could that be? 
I mean in the final timeline of the movie, was it known that Tom Cruise was the man who killed the chief mimic thingy and therefore won the war?

I guess I don't understand how we go from the scene where he kills the thing, is killed himself, the bad ass full metal chick is also killed, but suddenly he wakes up in the current timeline with the war being over? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> here's the latest on Pierce's grocery closing and the possibility of Willy Street opening up a third shop there

First of all Willy Street is THE ONLY interested party in that location at the moment.. There are no other suitors.

Secondly, the owner of that complex is notoriously cheap. Has been an issue for years. Will do anything he can to get out of upgrading and/or fixing glaring problems.

So Willy Street co-op made a demand that they will not rent that space unless the owner resurfaces the parking lot. Given that it currently looks like Falluja circa 2005 it's a completely reasonable demand.

so owner of the complex has been trying to get some kind of financial help from the city and/or a cheap loan or what have you to fix the parking lot.

So basically everything is still up in the air. Pierce's will be closed within the month either way regardless. </TEXT>

In November, I wrote about Peters plan to build a parking ramp above John Nolen Drive with a beautiful six acre park on top. The park would be paid with real estate impact fees. The city would borrow $12.5 million for the ramp, but Peters and his associates would pay it back by renting out the parking spaces at $140 a month. The cost to the taxpayer would be zero.

Oral beta-hydroxybutyrate supplementation in two patients with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia: monitoring of beta-hydroxybutyrate levels in blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and in the brain by in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy.


Plecko B1, Stoeckler-Ipsiroglu S, Schober E, Harrer G, Mlynarik V, Gruber S, Moser E, Moeslinger D, Silgoner H, Ipsiroglu O.



Abstract

In persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy, ketone body concentrations are abnormally low at times of hypoglycemia, depriving the brain of its most important alternative fuel. The neuroprotective effect of endogenous ketone bodies is evidenced by animal and human studies, but knowledge about exogenous supply is limited. Assuming that exogenous ketone body compounds as a dietetic food might replace this alternative energy source for the brain, we have monitored the fate of orally supplemented DL sodium beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) in two 6-mo-old infants with persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia for 5 and 7 mo, while on frequent tube-feedings and treatment with octreotide. Near total (95%) pancreatectomy had been ineffective in one patient and was refused in the other. In blood, concentrations of beta-OHB increased to levels comparable to a 16- to 24-h fast while on DL sodium beta-OHB 880 to 1000 mg/kg per day.

 ***In cerebrospinal fluid, concentrations of beta-OHB increased to levels comparable to a 24- to 40-h fast, after single dosages of 4 and 8 g, respectively.***

 High ratios of beta-OHB to acetoacetate indicated exogenous origin of beta-OHB. An increase of intracerebral concentrations of beta-OHB could be demonstrated by repetitive single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy by a clear doublet at 1.25 ppm. Oral DL sodium beta-OHB was tolerated without side effects. 

***This first report on oral supplementation of DL sodium beta-OHB in two patients with persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia demonstrates effective uptake across the blood-brain barrier and could provide the basis for further evaluation of the neuroprotective effect of beta-OHB in conditions with hypoketotic hypoglycemia.*** </TEXT>

<TEXT> if you Google "how long does it take to reach ketosis?" The accepted answer seems to be at least two days with no more than 20 g of carbohydrates

How precise is that?

Today the only sugar/carbs I consumed was a 7.5 ounce can of Coca-Cola which has 25 g of carbohydrates. so because I went slightly over that 20 carbohydrate number, the clock on reaching ketosis starts over?

<TEXT> dateline did an update on the Russell Faria case. He was originally convicted of killing his wife, then the conviction was overturned and he was exonerated

http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/russell-faria-s-wife-was-stabbed-times-but-was-he/article_dd93f262-594e-5b88-b53f-097fc10033c8.html

Here's my observations about the case

1. Pam Hupp is so obviously either the killer herself or arranged the murder. How anybody can't see that is beyond me. Her smirking face while being questioned is what evil looks like. Her lies upon lies upon lies became more ridiculous as the case went on.

2. The police blatantly lied about evidence that did not exist, and then suppressed evidence that would have been good for the defense. How can you sleep at night when you do that?

3. The judge hamstrung the defense and made what can only be described as bizarrely favorable rulings for the prosecution. Unreal. How is the defense not allowed to cross examine a prosecution witness?

4. The prosecution's own theory about how the murder took place was flat-out ridiculous and absurd. How and why the jury believed that I will never understand.

5. If you are a husband whose wife gets murdered God help you! The police WILL come for you. Overwhelming evidence of your innocence will be irrelevant.

6. the prosecution Implicating Russell's game night friends in the murder was unconscionable. Especially considering they had zero evidence to do so.

7. The defense's decision to forgo a jury trial the second time around and do a trial by judge was brilliant. Best decision they made.

overall it was a great episode. If you can watch it without commercials I highly recommend it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Badlands Texas" is a show on National Geographic about the murder of Glenn felts

http://www.outsideonline.com/1922521/murder-terlingua-texas

I previously posted about comments the jurors made after they voted to exonerate the man who had clearly committed murder

https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/3znx37/anybody_watching_badlands_texas_im_sorry_but_holy/

so as our story turns the jurors continue to be interviewed, and now two of them are saying The accused is 100% guilty and they regret having voted not guilty!

Apparently they are both now completely and totally convinced the accused is absolutely guilty. Why did they vote guilty? I still don't understand. They simply did not explain in any coherent semblance whatsoever why they voted not guilty.

one of the jurors actually sounded pretty guilty about the whole thing. Doesn't sound like he's sleeping well at night and whatnot. Another of the jurors had some kind of breakdown and had to get a hold of the judge in the case and have a counseling session with the judge which was weird. Something I've never heard of before.

Actually kind of feel bad for the jurors now.

the accused had to movehundreds of miles away to a completely different state because he was getting death threats.

The whole thing is so bizarre I don't even know what to make of it

Is this supposed to be like a diet restaurant? or like a low-carb place? never in my life have I seen a side so microscopically small

Bloodied boot tracksAll over the murder scene matched his boots. There was a whole host of other physical evidence that linked him to the crime including the fact that he himself admitted he got into a physical fight with the bar owner. He said the bar owner was alive when he left.

Anyway open and shut case right? Wrong.

SPOILERS!

Jury comes innocent. Town is in an uproar.

The interview the jurors.

Remember now this guy died from a brain aneurysm from his skull fracture. Juror says reason he voted not guilty with because there wasn't enough blood out in the sand. A skull fracture can be completely bloodless. No bleeding at all and you can still die from it. juror admitted there was quite a bit of blood around the body, but apparently it "wasn't enough". Wasn't enough for what? I have no clue

The blood on the accused boots? Apparently "it could've come from anywhere". And also "I don't know It just seemed like more stuff was going on you know?" What the fuck does that even mean?

and on and on it goes with one bizarre rationalization after another.

 these jurors were shockingly stupid and ignorant and obtuse. The crap they were saying wasn't even making any sense. Somehow the decided this guy didn't do it based on absurd fantasies in their own brains.

Dear God, if I ever commit murder I am going schedule it to do in Texas.

<TEXT> Would the holy Grail be considered a McGuffin?

What about Jason's Golden fleece?

What do you think the earliest example of a MacGuffin is?

In fiction, a MacGuffin (sometimes McGuffin or maguffin) is a plot device in the form of some goal, desired object, or other motivator that the protagonist pursues, often with little or no narrative explanation. The specific nature of a MacGuffin is typically unimportant to the overall plot.

Examples in film include: the meaning of "rosebud" in Citizen Kane (1941),[15] the priceless statue in The Maltese Falcon (1941), the NOC list in Mission: Impossible (1996) or the Rabbit's Foot in Mission: Impossible III (2006),[16][17] the briefcases in Pulp Fiction, several Coen brothers films, and Ronin, the rug in The Big Lebowski, the Heart of the Ocean necklace in Titanic,[18] the mineral unobtainium in Avatar (2009),[19] and the One Ring in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.[20] </TEXT>

<TEXT> James Jones is literally covered 100% of the time. All the time. There is never a time when he is on the field when he has broken coverage and is open. Ever.

The only time I can remember him being open the season was when he caught a touchdown against the Raiders and it was a total defensive breakdown and blown coverage.

I don't really see what value he brings to the team quite frankly. I do not want to see him on the team next year at all even for veterans minimum.

Janis, great on special teams, essentially sucks as a wide receiver. but I have to believe he would be open at least 15% of the time which is 15% more often than James Jones is.

that's my New Year's Eve grumpy rant.

Bah humbug, Go Pack,  and happy new year to you all!

<TITLE> This is what's wrong with the Packers passing offense this season. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-22 16:23:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> after Jordy went down, the Packers did not have a true number one receiver. Instead they had a few very green not ready for primetime receivers, and a couple of slow possession type receivers, and one quality slot receiver.

this offense is predicated on receivers being able to break man-to-man coverage, timing routes, and yards after the catch. With this wide receiver group you simply can't run that offense.

Adams was drafted to be James Jones' replacement. That's why Jones was cut as soon as Adams was drafted. Jones and Adams are both somewhat slow, possession type receivers. In the offense the Packers run your possession receiver is usually the quarterbacks third option. the Packers have repeatedly put 2 slow possession type receivers on the field at the same time. Doesn't work.

Think about this. Many times this season the Packers have had Jones, Adams, R. Rodgers and Randall Cobb on the field at the same time. Adams is already slow plus he's dealing with an ankle injury which makes him stupidly slow. Jones has always been slow and has even lost a step in old age. Richard Rogers is one of the slowest tight ends I have ever seen playing the game.

So you've got three stupidly slow receivers who can't break man-to-man coverage and can't get open on their own, plus you have one quality slot receiver. When defenses know you don't have a deep threat, safeties can cheat down and cover your slot receiver. That's why Randall Cobb has been shut down most of the season.

this is also why the Montgomery Injury was huge. Even though he is a rookie, and doesn't know the playbook, at least he has speed and he could break man-to-man coverage. I saw him break man-to-man coverage repeatedly earlier in the season.

watching Aaron Rodgers dropback, watching the O line give him awesome protection, and then seeing him with ABSOLUTELY NOBODY to throw to is just maddening. And that's what we've seen down after down, series after series, game after game this year.

I'm sorry to say but this is not a Super Bowl caliber passing offense right now.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> reminder: the down vote button is not a disagree button!

This is not a Super Bowl contending team. Right now it just isn't. It got manhandled by a legit Super Bowl contender who was the Carolina Panthers, and for three quarters it was manhandled by the Lyons completely until they decided to Lyons it up.

beyond that this team DESPERATELY needs help at both left tackle and right tackle.

Bulaga is a great player when healthy He's just never healthy! Let's get real. The guy just can't stay healthy for a full season, or even a half a season.

Bahktiari is probably a second string level talents to be honest. WAY too many penalties, and his run blocking is atrocious.

tackles are a very very valued commodity in the draft.

Personally I'd rather lose a few more games this year and for once draft at least in the middle of the first route instead of always drafting at the end of the first round. Let Ted address our glaring needs on offensive line, and come back next year strong and ready to compete for another Super Bowl ring

<TEXT> so I went to this restaurant over by target on the Eastside called the journey. It's a buffet style. They specialize in seafood and specifically sushi.

First off the sushi was NOT fresh. It sits on these plates under the warm lights and even though there is ice underneath the plates the plates are essentially warm because of the lights and the sushi basically stays warm for God knows how long.

I sampled a bunch of the different sushi rolls and the quality ranged from semi-okay to really not good at all. Several tasted just on the verge of going bad. I've had better sushi at Hyvee. 

but honestly how can you leave RAW fish under warm lights for hours at a time? How is this even legal?

some kind of stuffed crab dish also was off. Tasted like it been sitting out for the last seven or eight hours. Possibly was.

Did I just go at a bad time? It was Saturday afternoon and fairly busy

maybe things are better if I get there as soon as they open up?

Manna Caf: Excellent food, but serving size is occasionally ludicrously small. Ordered a brisket sandwich (small but delicious), the side of potato salad was literally 2 spoonfuls. Literally. Paid $12 for lunch (with tip), left hungry.

Generic Chinese restaurant: don't know the name, it's in the same complex as Manna. The tiny corncobs they put on taste like they spilled pesticides on them. Complained, was told it was taken care of. Ordered again a month later, same problem. Never again.

Wiggies: known drug dealing location. Often has sketchy weirdos hanging out in parking lot. No thank you.

Northside family restaurant: everything I've ever gotten here was slightly disgusting

QQ Chinese buffet: no longer in business. But when it was it had a rotting ceiling tiles, moldy carpet, food sitting in buffet for hours on end, and a completely indifferent staff

Benevenutos: perfectly good food, way way overpriced.

Coffee Gallerie: good coffee, terrible food

Habanero's: good Mexican food, no complaints.

Kavanaugh's Esquire Club: never actually been there, I think they turn you away If you are under 65 years old

Jim's meat market: darn good food, take out only. Seriously the best burger you'll get anywhere in Madison for $7. also, good fish fry.
 
I think that is literally every restaurant in the north side, aside from corporate chain restaurants like McDonald's or whatever.

I've been doing this for years and years. Let me tell you something Never ever ever ever have I seen these people freaking out like they are right now. I'm serious. If you've ever wanted to see an entire group of people totally and completely melt down now is your chance.

First it was the Confederate flag and how they're stealing our heritage and Are going to be coming for the American flag and how they're destroying the Constitution blah blah

Then it was Obama care. And how Obama care is part of some insanely diabolical left-wing conspiracy to give us all healthcare which will eventually result in some kind of totalitarian socialist communist nightmare

And now gay marriage. Holy shit! The rainbow colors on the official White House website are causing these people to absolutely flip their lids.

They're talking about gathering all their friends together and marching on Washington and finally "taking back the country." A phrase they repeat ad nauseam

I'm completely serious. These people are utterly and completely losing their ever loving minds

In a way it's funny. In a way it's entertaining. In another way it's just sad. I view all these things as social progress. They view Obama as literally Satan incarnate, and all these issues as the fall of the Roman Empire

I careen around high foot traffic area at crazy high speeds, narrowly missing demolishing children and pets because I'm special and have absolutely no regard for the safety or well-being of other human beings.

I dart in and out of traffic, sometimes causing cars to squeal to a stop, Potentially crashing, because the laws of traffic do not apply to me! Because I ride a fixie!

I am an arrogant douche nozzle and have absolutely no care or concern about how my actions affect other human beings.

<TITLE> Two-parter: Is the word assassin actually derived from the word hashish? Did Hassan-i Sabbh himself encourage his operatives (ie 'assassins') to use hashish? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-11 16:25:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Note: I asked this question last week and got no response. So I'm reposting it. Hopefully that's okay? Don't want to break any rules

1.

If you look at the Wikipedia entry for assassins, they make a strong case that the word is actually derived from the word hashish

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassins#Etymology[1]

But then it seems to contradict itself later on with this quote from a historian

The truth is different. According to texts that have come down to us from Alamut, Hassan-i Sabbah liked to call his disciples Asasiyun, meaning people who are faithful to the Ass, meaning "foundation" of the faith. This is the word, misunderstood by foreign travellers, that seemed similar to "hashish".[10]

so which is it? Is assassins derived from hashish? Or is it derived from Asas? 

2.

Hassan-i Sabbh, the man who founded the original assassin order, seemed to be VERY fervently religious. Is there any actual evidence to suggest that he encouraged his disciples and/or operatives to consume hashish?

Or is it possible this is a kind of historical urban legend with little or no substance to it? Or maybe it was part of a smear job by pro-Crusader historians?

<TEXT> in another thread people were arguing about zinc, and how much was lost with each ejaculation

So I found this study, which amasses data from many different studies  to detail exactly what is lost to ejaculation

http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2164/jandrol.04104/full


Note that its expressed in terms of  mg/100 mL. In other words you lose X mg of nutrient Y per 100 mL of semen.

You can also see that the different studies found different results, meaning you don't lose an exact perfect amount of nutrient X every time you ejaculate. Rather there's a ballpark on how much you lose

One subject that study did not look at was the hormones you lose to ejaculation. If somebody has that study please post it </TEXT>

How can I help him? What are his options?

Should he talk to an immigration attorney? Can anybody recommend an immigration attorney that they know of who is quality and does good work?

Should he contact a congressman? How do you go about doing that?

<TITLE> Everybody missed out on why this episode was called "Lost Horizon." It's pretty obvious once you see it </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-05-05 16:04:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> lost Horizon was originally a short novel by James Hilton (also wrote goodbye Mr. chips), then a movie (1937-great movie), and a remake (1973, Goofy movie)

The original movie was actually done by Frank Capra, famous for making it's a wonderful life and many other classics.

the story is about a small group of British diplomats escaping an uprising in India, who then get kidnapped by mysterious figures. They are brought to a secret city hidden away in the Himalayas called Shangri-La.

The city is perfect in every way. There is peace and harmony, everybody gets educated, and most noted people don't seem to age when they are there.

Long story short, the main character eventually decides to leave. It's only when he's left that he realizes how amazing it was and he tries so hard to get back but he can never get back. He's been kicked out of heaven and he can't get back in.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Horizon#Plot_summary

This episode is about the main characters being kicked out of Shangri-La - or in this case sterling Cooper -- and being thrown into the real world. And it's only once they are there in the real world do they realize how good they had it at sterling Cooper.

but here's the thing - once you leave Shangri-La you can never go back!

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> so I was told that the only way to make french fries (from raw fresh-cut potatoes) that are crisp on the outside and tender on the inside is that you have to blanch them in cold water first.

But I was watching diners drive-ins and dives the other day, and one of the restaurants was making fries with fresh cut potatoes. They deep-fried them for a little while, then remove them from the oil and let them rest, then they fried them some more. Allegedly this is a way of making crisp on the outside tender on the inside french fries .

 Does anybody know  if that technique works and how long you are supposed to cook them the first time and the second time and how long to let them cool/rest in between? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Monster of Florence: GREAT book about Italy's most notorious, unsolved, serial killer case. Highly recommended, fascinating read. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-20 18:04:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> if you are into unsolved mysteries, this book is right up your alley. The monster of Florence  is/was by far and away the most famous serial killer case in Italian history. To this day it, technically, remains unsolved.

I say "technically" because it's highly likely the authors of the book did in fact solve the murders - at least in my humble opinion. Unfortunately the Italian justice system doesn't see it that way.

It's also really interesting because this all ties into the Amanda Knox case. The prosecuting attorney in the Amanda Knox case is also the one that's currently handling the monster of Florence case. And this guy's a world-class nutcase. Once you realize just how crazy this guy is you understand that Amanda Knox was and is completely and totally innocent and was jailed in a grand miscarriage of justice.

You also get a  deep insight into the Italian criminal justice system, and let me tell you it's scary. They will jail you for five years just on suspicion of a crime alone, then when you have been found innocent they let you go after your life has been ruined.

anyway, GREAT book. Highly recommended.

<TEXT> so apparently these monkeys got their hands on magical guns. These magical guns never jammed, they didn't have any kind of a safety feature (brand-new guns always come with tthe safety on, and are always stored with the safety on), and most of all they had magical ammo clips that never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ran out of bullets and never ever ever ever need to be reloaded.

I'm sorry it's ridiculous!

If this was one small tiny part of the movie I would just overlook it.

**But the entire freaking movie turned on this one utterly ridiculous magical guns premise!**

there was that one ultra warrior monkey who, during the main battle, got on his horse with two fully automatic machine guns blazing away, and blazing away, and blazing away and blazing away

Whatever. Apparently not too many other people were bothered by this because I haven't read anything about it.

<DATE> 2015-02-03 22:36:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm not saying the show itself is bad, I'm saying the format is terrible and doesn't work and here's why.

1. One half of a 30 minute show is to short for a panel discussion

The nightly show seems to be following in the footsteps of the bill maher show and/or The Cycle on MSNBC. In other words a group of four or five people sitting around discussing the hot button issue of the day.

The problem is 4 different people can't throw out an opinion and then discuss that opinion in just a few short minutes. And one half of a 30 minute show is very short time.

For instance last night 4 people plus Larry were discussing obesity. all four were barely able to get one point across, and none of those points got really discussed in length at all. How could it? One half of a 30 minute show is what Maybe nine minutes in actual airtime?

It's too damn short for a panel discussion. That's all.

2. Everybody's too nice

So far they're getting together 4 enlightened liberal super nice super courteous people to discuss things.

There's not enough disagreement!

Last night somebody said obesity was a disability because most diets fail. Nobody bothered to call her out on her bull shit, because everybody's being courteous and nice and PC and accommodating.

You know what I call a discussion where nobody disagrees with each other? Boring!

So far the first half of the show has been okay, but the second half in my opinion has fallen flat and the format will not work. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Suggestion for those struggling with cover art - look at movie posters! </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> there's been multiple posts recently with people struggling with book cover art.

My suggestion for those is to look at movie posters. The people who design and create movie posters really know what they are doing. They have the whole thing down to a science.

they know how to grab your attention, and they know how to draw your attention to specific elements in the design, they know what good title placement is, they know where to put the title and what type of font and how big to make the title. Etc. etc.

Of course it's not exactly the same thing because movie posters want you to pay attention to it the actors themselves. Where is a book cover will not have that.

But the basic elements of design are the same. The use of negative space and the ability to draw your attention to this specific place or that specific place is all the same.

Anyway I thought some people might benefit from the suggestion.

sure he's a scumbag who threw his brother under the bus, and sure he sent in his lovely wife as bait for an assassin. But who among us has not done these things? and let's face it, his first wife kind of deserved it.

But he is ultimately the one who set the trap (literally) that led to Malvo's demise. I mean do you honestly believe Gus would've gotten the drop on Malvo at the cabin if Malvo had not been hindered by a bear trap wound? I seriously doubt it.

he does deserve some credit for taking down the most fearsome hitman east of the Rockies

<TEXT> okay

Windows 8 64-bit

I have added the printer. I have updated the driver.when I click "devices and printers" it shows my specific printer there. At one point it had a yellow triangle because I guess I didn't have the updated driver uploaded. Now the correct drivers uploaded. The yellow triangle is gone. (picture #4)

However!

When I go to actually print, it doesn't show that I have any printers available. (picture #1) Then when I select "find printer", it doesn't show that my printer is there and available to be selected (picture #2, 3,)

allegedly in 'printers and devices' you can right-click on the printer you want and then select to set it as your default printer. However! When I right-click on it does not give me that option as you can see picture number five

Any help would be appreciated

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Asus PC desktop computer with a Canon image class 3010 printer

The printer is plugged in in the proper port

I downloaded the driver directly from the Canon website

I cannot print from it. The computer simply doesn't recognize it at all. iin fact it says I have no printer connected to this computer at all.

I've used advanced printer setup and it still will not recognize the printer

Any ideas?

EDIT: in "devices and printers" the image class printer is listed there, but it has a yellow triangle with a exclamation point in it

So I'm assuming that's bad

EDIT:  so apparently the yellow triangle means you got an error code. Here's the weird thing, in my device manager it lists 2 printers - 'canon MF 3010', and 'MF 3010'.

one is listed as working fine, the others listed as not having a driver loaded. 

I tried to uninstall both of those thinking I would reinstall the correct driver. No luck. I have uninstalled them three times now and every time I start my computer there they are again. One listed is working fine the other listed is not working because it doesn't have a driver.

Meanwhile my computer does not list a printer option at all when I click print </TEXT>

<TITLE> Opinion: The 49ers are doing the RIGHT thing by firing Jim Harbaugh. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-25 17:47:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> You can call it being fired. You can call it being let go. You can call it refusing to renew his contract Whatever you want to call it.

The fact is he's probably gone.

I would say about 99% or more of the comments I've seen pretty much everywhere are people saying the 49ers are stupid and dumb for allowing him to walk. And given that they were crap before he got there, and he led them to quite a bit of success, that's a perfectly reasonable opinion.

But I disagree. Here's why.

**Personnel Decisions**

Imagine you work for a small company. There is one employee is just Incompetent. He doesn't really know what he's doing, he does most of his work half assed, and just generally isn't up to par. The problem is that he makes EVERYBODY ELSE have to work harder to make up for his crappy work.

Just for fun we will call this person "Roman". So everybody goes to the boss and says "you really have to fire Roman. He's incompetent and he's making everybody else's life more difficult."

And the boss ssays to you all "no! Absolutely not! He's my buddy!  No way I fire that guy!"

"Yes but He sucks! He doesn't do his job well! He's making everybody else's  job more difficult!"

"Tough shit! Too bad! Now shut up and do your jobs!"

Would you like to work for a man like that? Of course not. A person like that has no concept of what a tough and yet smart personnel decision really is all about.

In this little story "Roman" represents the 49ers offensive coordinator. He sucks. In case you're confused about the issue, look at the playcalling in the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl. You can make an argument he lost that Super Bowl for that team.

Nobody likes to fire their friend. Nobody likes to fire their little buddy.. But sometimes when you're an adult in a position of authority you have to make difficult choices and do the right thing and fire your little buddy.

Jim Harbaugh refuses to do that. It's indicative of a larger problem wherein Jim seems to act like a little tyrant and lack the maturity to do the right thing. I'm sure there are other cases that are hurting the team where he takes the same attitude.

 **Colin Kaepernick has REGRESSED under Harbaugh**

there is no position in the NFL more important than quarterback. The 49ers made the right decision by trading Alex Smith and going with Colin. However, under Jim Harbaugh's tutelage Colin has regressed in darn near every phase of the game.

Instead of looking at Collins game, emphasizing his strong points and making him a better quarterback, Jim has tried to be an authoritarian and force his own view of what a quarterback should do and how a quarterback should act down Colin's throat. It's been a miserable failure.

A good coach adapts to the players he has, he emphasizes their strengths and makes their weaknesses better. A bad coach tries to force players be something they are not. Jim Harbaugh right now is a bad coach for Colin Kaepernick.


and once again we see that he acts like a tyrant, a big boss nobody better question, somebody unable to be flexible and roll with the punches. That's just not a recipe for success.

****Inability to work well with others****

sounds kind of stupid perhaps? I mean he's the coach right? Shouldn't other people try to work with him instead of the other way around?

But the fact of the matter is EVERYBODY in a position of leadership must form cohesive relationships with other people in that organization in order for that organization to be successful.

Jim Harbaugh doesn't seem to be capable of doing this. He doesn't seem to be capable of having anybody else have any input or say so or control in any way shape or form.  He seems like a person who is incapable of taking any criticism from anybody.

Again, this is not how you become a long term success in ANY organization anywhere.

***In my personal opinion*** , even if Jim were retained beyond this year his success would likely be minimal. The 49ers have likely rode his coattails to as much success as he's going to have with that organization. Being passionate and intense and being a GREAT motivator (which he is), only gets you so far. Beyond that you need more qualities to remain a long-term success in this league and Jim Harbaugh does not have those qualities.

***In my personal opinion*** Jim Harbaugh should become a college coach. College coaches are encouraged to be tyrants. That's okay! People are actually fine with that. Players never are allowed to talk back to them. People treat them as virtual gods. That's what Jim Harbaugh needs. That's where he should go. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> can somebody explain in simple everyday terms what nerve growth factor does in the body? Or even if you have a link to a really simple straightforward article on it that would be great

trying to read the Wikipedia article on it and it has such sentences as this

NGF binds to high-affinity tyrosine kinase receptor TrkA. TrkA dimerizes and autophosphorylates its tyrosine kinase segment, which leads to the activation of PI 3-kinase, ras, and PLC signaling pathways. Alternatively, the p75NTR receptor can form a heterodimer with TrkA which has higher affinity and specificity for NGF.

Which means absolutely 100% nothing to me. I'm finding that for medical subjects Wikipedia is often written at a PhD level and is worthless for the average person

<TEXT> looking at 4k cameras and I notice a lot of people are complaining about a fixed pattern noise problem which is basically some kind of lines appearing on the video feed. Wondering if anybody's had that problem?

Also many people are complaining about weird image choppiness while panning with 4K cameras. Anybody have that issue?

somebody on Amazon describe the problem thusly

Because this is a 30p camcorder at 4K, panning or moving the camera from side to side, will produce choppy motions. This includes being in a playground capturing my daughter on a merry-go-round or just running around the house chasing her. This may seem tolerable when uploaded to YouTube or Vimeo since they are inherently a 30p streaming service, but this choppy motion gets magnified when burned on Blu-Ray which must now convert a 30p footage into 60p. The result is even worst. And this is using professional grade software such as Final Cut Pro X and Adobe Media Encoder CS6.

Thanks for any input. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [No Regrets]: If you don't feel bad 

it is one nightmare after another after another after another after another with these people.

I can't take it anymore. The latest round is me trying for two weeks just to get my doctor to call me back. One stupid freaking phone call. A phone call. Two weeks. They finally called me back today to set up an appointment for three days from now. This is just a simple follow-up phone call. It will literally take 3 to 5 minutes.

The entire VA system is perpetually criminally negligent of our veterans and I'm done. I've had enough. I fight these people, I argue with these people, I make complaints, I go to the patient advocate, I confront VA workers, I confront my doctors, etc. etc. etc. etc.

It does no good. No good whatsoever. Nobody at the VA gives a shit if I live or die. In fact I get the overwhelming impression they would rather see me dead so they wouldn't have to put up with my crap anymore. They prefer veterans who never complain, who roll over and take it in the ass without any lip.

the latest doctor I've seen literally doesn't know what the function of an x-ray is, what you can and cannot diagnose using just an x-ray, and is an all-around idiot. An actual bona fide complete total moron. in one 15 minute visit he told me three egregiously wrong things that were overwhelmingly proven incorrect by simple Google searches. I told another doctor what he said and that Dr. just sat there blinkin with a blank look on his face, and eventually acknowledge that perhaps the doctor had given out incorrect information.

I have fantasies about running him over with my wheelchair, again and again and again, as I shout "HAVE YOU FIGURED WHAT AN X-RAY IS YET YOU DUMB MOTHER FUCKER?" 

this is all just the tip of the iceberg. It's one story after another after another after another. The entire system is rife with incompetence stupidity and uncaring assholes.

somehow or another I swear to God I'm going to get together the money and get myself some private insurance and never ever ever go back to the VA again as long as I live.

<TEXT> I've used the 'Thai kitchen' brand red and green curry paste before that comes in a small bottle, it was nothing special although I guess it wasn't horrible.

I'm wondering if somebody can give me a recommendation for a good curry paste

I'm going to use it in making Thai coconut curry stews in my slow cooker

Thank you </TEXT>

<TITLE> How to make beef stew with super tender beef in a slow cooker? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I tried making beef stew in the slow cooker one time before and the beef ended up being really chewy which I absolutely despise

I would like to make beef stew in the slow cooker and I would like to have real nice super tender beef

 what's the trick? I can't remember specifically what the cut of beef was that I use previously, and there is a specific cut that works better?

Any tips?

by the way, for me beef stew is just your basic beef, carrots, potatoes, onions, peppers, etc. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Plants in my raised bed are dying due to waterlogged soil. What can I do? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-03 18:18:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've got tall raised bed gardens. They are 22 inches tall made of cedar. I'm planting mostly wheatgrass for juicing

Every time I plant the crop of grass it grows absolutely beautiful, but at some point (usually when the grass is 4  6 inches) after a few rains it develop some kind of slime at the very base of the plant by the soil, I'm assuming the slime develops in the root system and is climbing up. The slime eventually kills the grass


What can I do to address the situation?

I plant the grass very close together and thick. You think I should planted much thinner to give it better airflow?

maybe just drilling a whole series of holes along the base of the planter will be good enough?

Or maybe I need to take out all of the soil, lay down a layer of gravel on the bottom of the bed, put landscaping cloth on top of that, and then put my soil back on top of that. Would be a lot of work and expense but maybe that's the only way to deal with it? </TEXT>

Relit the pilot light, everything seems okay. Later that day no more hot water, go back to light the pilot light again, this time it will not light at all

What do you think? Thermocouple? Igniter? Seems like if it was just the igniter the pilot light wouldn't be going out like that in the first place

Also the little drain thing on the side is leaking just a bit suddenly today. Is that related?

plumbers want crazy amounts of money just to show up and diagnose the problem, if I pay them back, then I pay them to fix the problem I'm damn near paying what I would pay for entire new hot water heater!

The screen will freeze up, with a sort of strobe flashing. No ability to move mouse or anything, completely frozen.

I wait for a while, started up, and it starts up normally and works fine nothing has been lost nothing has been destroyed.

Seems to only happen after I've had it on for a while. A couple of times a sort of loud beeping has occurred, but not every time.

Is that overheating? What do I do about that? Do I need a new fan or something?

this is a gateway desktop running windows 7, Intel 3.3 GHz

Computer shows My hard disk drive has got 917 GB with 853 free

RAM showing 6 GB, 5.88 usable

 EDIT:

Well now it just did a weird thing. Screen froze up for one second, then the computer rebooted all by itself. I get the black and white screen that says the computer did not shut down normally and gives me three options to reboot

the computer had only been turned on about 10 minutes at that point. And had been shut down all night. I don't think you can overheat in 10 minutes right?

<TEXT> I am rated 80% disabled through the VA

I have an electric wheelchair issued by the VA.

The corrupt incompetent dumb ass subcontractor that the VA uses to fix my chair screwed my chair up majorly. Big time . So much so that now it doesn't work and nobody wants to work on it because they don't want get involved in the mass that he made

I'm beyond angry. I went to the patient advocate about the wheelchair so they are working on getting it fixed. Patient advocate says they're going to get on it I don't know if that's can happen or not. The person at the VA in charge of fixing the wheelchairs threatening to not fix it and basically take it away from me. I just went on a 20 minute rant with the patient advocate I'm not really sure if he's worth his salt or not. Quite frankly he didn't really seem like he cared that much.

My question is about the subcontractor. What can I do to make sure he doesn't get any more contracts? This asshole screwed me big time and I'm about ready to lose my mind.

 Wheelchair doesn't work I'm stuck in this house looking at these four walls losing my freaking mind

I swear to God I'm going to my Congressman If these asshole's don't fix this pretty soon. I'll bet if these fuckers had to sit in a house staring at the four walls for days and days on end they actually get off their ass and pretend like they care about doing their jobs

Mother Fokker

Sorry for the rant but I'm losing my freaking mind over here. I swear to God if something doesn't happen here pretty soon somebody's going to lose their freaking job over this

oh and by the way VA head of prosthetics (department in charge of fixing the wheelchair) just told me this is all my fault and then hung the phone up on me. Hung up on me!

<TITLE> Need advice re: marinating a steak. How long is too long? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> so I got me a nice 8 ounce ribeye steak. I want this to be as tender as I can possibly make it

So they tell me the way to do this is marinade

I've got some vinegar and some spices. Now what?

Do I just rub the spices On the steak and drop It in a bowl with some vinegar? Do I cover the entire state with the vinegar?

And most importantly How long should I do it for? How long is too long? Is 24 hours too long?

Thanks

found this

Don't ruin expensive steaks by marinating them; quality cuts like rib-eye, porterhouse, T-bone, filet mignon, and NY strip are great as they are don't need to be marinated.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> possibly the wrong sub forum, but the only other forums that might be more geared towards patent issues are completely dead.

Anyway, I'm having the darndest time trying to figure out if a specific product has a patent on it or not. I'm like 90% sure that the product was initially patented in 1971, and that the patents expired in the 90s.

However, it's possible that they tweaked the design and renewed the patent on it. I can't find that information.

There is no patent number listed on the product itself, or on its packaging. The company website does not claim the product is patented, nor does it claim is not patented. The company website has other products on it that It does claim to be patented.

searching for patents on .

http://www.uspto.gov/patents/process/search/

Brings up a lot of patents that are similar, but I can't find one that definitely fits the bill here.

Is my only choice here to pay $500 for an attorney to answer this question?

I mean, I like to save that money for prior art search, although I must say as time goes on and I keep searching and searching I'm sort of winding up doing my own prior art search.

Ideas? Thoughts?

could I just call the company (multinational Corporation) and ask?

But now mainstream publications like the LA Times are reporting that even the IPCC acknowledges this is a thing and are scrambling to try to explain it

Is there really a pause? Are climate scientists "scrambling to explain it"? Is this a monkeywrench in the accepted theory of man-made climate change?

Re:

http://www.latimes.com/science/la-sci-climate-change-uncertainty-20130923,0,791164.story

It's a climate puzzle that has vexed scientists for more than a decade and added fuel to the arguments of those who insist man-made global warming is a myth.

Since just before the start of the 21st century, the Earth's average global surface temperature has failed to rise despite soaring levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases and years of dire warnings from environmental advocates.

Now, as scientists with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change gather in Sweden this week to approve portions of the IPCC's fifth assessment report, they are finding themselves pressured to explain this glaring discrepancy. </TEXT>

I mean you can turn what were formerly lush green areas into deserts through clearcutting and soil degradation. So Can you do the reverse? 

Let's say you take a large land area Of New Mexico, plant massive amounts of trees, grasses, and other plants. The plants are going to draw water up from the ground, That water then is released into the sky through transpiration, which helps form clouds which may actually cause rain etc.

I mean is this feasible? if so, why don't we do it?

Most likely be taking mainly outside landscape shots, maybe a little bit of inside possibly lowlight shots

Do NOT care about zoom, if it has a nice zoom fine, if not fine

Price Range $200  $300 give or take

Considering the Olympus XZ 1. It's got a great f/1.8 aperture, but it only has 10 megapixels. How much will that limit me as far as blowing up the pictures?

 http://www.amazon.com/Olympus-Digital-Camera-3-Inch-Monitor/dp/B004G8QSTO

Also considering Nikon cool pix 310. Great aperture, great price, but apparently it has a small light sensor

<TEXT> for years and years my credit rating was crap, but finally I got It all cleaned up And squared away. Bought a house last year, and started stacking credit cards (that I haven't used) so that my available credit to actual credit used ratio is really good.

So Now what? Can I do anything really cool with my great credit rating?

I mean I already own house. Besides buying a bunch of stuff on credit (which I have no interest in doing) is there anyway I can use this credit rating to my advantage that I'm currently unaware of? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> so I'm reading through this study about the effects of thyme oil on aging rat brains and I come across this sentence

The proportion of 22 : 6n-3 in brain phospholipids, which declined
with age in control rats, was also significantly higher in rats given either supplement. This latter finding is particularly important as optimum levels of 22 : 6n-3 are required for normal brain function. 

What does that mean exactly? Here is the link for the study, PDF alert

<TEXT> Re:

http://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/greenhouse-gas-levels-highest-in-3m-years-20130428-2imrr.html

Carbon dioxide concentrations in the Earth's atmosphere are on the cusp of reaching 400 parts per million for the first time in 3 million years.

The daily CO2 level, measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, was 399.72 parts per million last Thursday, and a few hourly readings had risen to more than 400 parts per million.

''I wish it weren't true but it looks like the world is going to blow through the 400 ppm level without losing a beat,'' said Ralph Keeling, a geologist with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in the US, which operates the Hawaiian observatory.

''At this pace we'll hit 450 ppm within a few decades.''

<TEXT> so like I said I keep getting this error message over and over again, both when I'm watching movies and when I'm not. It gives me a choice to stop the script or not, sometimes when I stop the script everything is fine and I can continue on.

Unfortunately sometimes my computer freezes up completely and I have to open task manager and then I have to Select flash plug-in and end the process which then unfreezes my computer. Unfortunately it also crashes any movie or media that I happen to be watching at the moment.

Any ideas why I keep getting this error message? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Would you replace a 20-year-old furnace that's working great? Just got a home improvement loan I need to make this decision </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-01-25 19:17:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just found out I qualify for the five-year forgivable home-improvement loan of $7000. the money can only be used for very specific things.

I live in a very small house and about $3800 of the loan is going to go towards putting a new roof on.

My furnace is 23 years old and I'm considering spending $2200 on buying a newer more efficient model. However, the furnace repair Man told me the furnace looks great, the heat exchangers look great, it's not leaking any carbon monoxide whatsoever, and that he has seen this type of furnace last 30 or 35 years. it's also got a brand-new ignitor in it

Do you think I should spend the money to replace the furnace or spend it on other things like insulation, window glazing etc.? </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Obviously spoilers*

Both movies feature protagonists caught in some kind of time travel loop. Both protagonists are the only ones that ultimately see the truly tragic end of the current timeline.

Both of them work mightily and heroically to somehow alter tragic outcome of the actions of the various people around them, and both ultimately fail.

And ultimately both decide the only resolution to the conundrum is to essentially commit suicide.

Now obviously there's lots of specifics in each movie that are completely different. But if you boil it down to its core, both movies present protagonists with essentially the same problem and those two protagonists deal with, and ultimately solve, the problem in the same way

So there were 2 endings, the fake ending and the real one

The fake ending (massive shootout everybody dies) was by far and away the better ending, it was realistic and riveting, it was tragic and kind of romantic all same time. Very butch Cassidy

The real ending was absolute crap. All fluffy and colorful, everybody lives happily ever after, all of the bad guys get their comeuppance, all of the "good" guys ride off into perfectly picturesque sunset to have endless threesomes in some nondescript Third World country

Give me a break. Nobody has the balls to put up real ending on a movie anymore </TEXT>

<DATE> 2012-11-10 16:41:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Here is a rundown of all of the national polls on Monday, just 24 hours before the election. most of the polls that are regularly reported on CNN and Fox news ABC news etc. were wrong. Every single one of those polls was biased against Obama and towards Romney.

http://imgur.com/81NVw

Notice the average of all of the polls is +1.6 in favor of Obama

I don't have a conspiracy theory here. I'm not accusing anybody of anything. I'm simply pointing out that nearly every major national poll was wrong, and wrong in a way that favored Mitt Romney. I don't know how that happened but it did happen

CNN just reported he will almost certainly win the popular vote by more than 3%.

Here's more on that

http://www.examiner.com/article/obama-likely-to-win-popular-vote-by-more-than-3

In the future I'm going to pay more attention to the Washington Post/ABC polls because that one seems to have been the most accurate. the Rasmussen polls  Error rate is reported as either 3% or 4% depending. Interestingly enough they were wrong by EXACTLY 4%. But I'm sure that's just a big coincidence

Here is another look which clearly shows the overwhelming majority of Polls were heavily skewed in favor of Mr. Romney (thanks to jk 13)

<TEXT> I'd like to get a serious discussion going about using this plant as actual medicine, not just a way to get stoned. I think most people here have seen the video Rick Simpson where he makes the concentrated hemp oil and then uses it to treat all kinds of things including cancer

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nm7nqUigFA

Has anybody actually tried to make that concentrated substance? What kind of results did you have? What did you use it for? What was your method of distilling the THC? how much plant do you need to make a fair amount of the concentrated oil?

I'm really interested in making this myself however I'm having a very difficult time getting enough of the plant to make it. I would really love to hear some actual experience and testimonials with this

<TEXT> even if you think the invasion of Iraq wasn't mainly due to oil, you have to admit controlling the oil was at least one part of the motivation. If you think that oil had absolutely nothing to do with our invasion of Iraq, then I think you are a very nave and blind person.

And then there is project Ajax in 1953, wherein we overthrew a democratically elected government of Iran because that government had recently seized control of its own oil fields out of the hands of British Petroleum. That whole operation was all about oil.

that's just two examples of many many I could come up with.

we kill people to procure oil resources. It's really that simple

Is that somehow better or worse than killing people because they insulted our religion? sure we can make fun and mock and laugh at the stupid Muslims for getting upset about a YouTube video

But we kill people to steal their oil. Are we really any better? </TEXT>

So without the shockwave flash plug-in most videos don't work. if I want to watch a video I have to shut down completely Dragon, then enable the plug-in, then play the video. Then I have to go and disable the plug-in before I start up Dragon again, and keep it disable the whole time. If I forget and have them both at the same time it totally screws up Dragon and I have to restart my whole computer again

What can I do about this? I've contacted nuance (the maker of Dragon NaturallySpeaking) and their customer support is terrible

So you're supposed to use metal cookware. I used my Cuisinart nonstick frying pan, but it doesn't work. The cooktop keeps giving the error signal which indicates you are not using the proper cookware

That's what I'm using, which is metal and theoretically it should work.

I know they say that an iron skillet is the best, but I have severe arthritis in my hands and they are too heavy for me

Anybody have luck using some kind of nonstick cookware on an induction cooktop? in stainless steel the best option? </TEXT>

Call the Gateway tech support and it was the worst tech support in the history of the universe. Absolutely awful. Totally worthless.

Called up Best Buy tech support and he says that he thinks it's a software update issue. Like the Gateway need some kind of an update to recognize the Dell monitor. But since I only have the one monitor I don't know how I'm going to download any kind of software update onto the Gateway

In 2009, for the first time, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce surpassed both the Republican and Democratic National Committees on political spending; the following year, more than 90 percent of the Chamber's cash went to GOP candidates, many of whom deny the existence of global warming. 

Not long ago, the Chamber even filed a brief with the EPA urging the agency not to regulate carbon  should the world's scientists turn out to be right and the planet heats up, the Chamber advised, "populations can acclimatize to warmer climates via a range of behavioral, physiological and technological adaptations." As radical goes, demanding that we change our physiology seems right up there. </TEXT>

James Holmes, the detained shooter in our latest national mass murder tradegy, bought four guns from various retailers over the last two months.

[Snip]

**A high-volume drum magazine was attached to the rifle, making that rifle an assault weapon and allowing him to fire 50 to 60 rounds in under sixty seconds.**

Led by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Congress passed the Federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB) on September 13 1994 and signed into law by President Clinton the very same day. But the law expired on September 13, 2004. Despite numerous attempts by Senator Feinstein and others in the Democratic leadership, attempts to renew the AWB have all failed because of Republican opposition. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Due to a kidney condition it is very important I keep my sodium intake low. So I am always checking the sodium content on food labels.

I know what food taste like that has 500 mg of sodium and I know what food taste like that has 2000 mg sodium.

There are couple companies that I am close to 100% sure are blatantly and massively lying about the sodium content in their food. A very popular brand of frozen burrito's claims to have 500 mg of sodium in each burrito. Absolutely not. The taste of salt is overwhelming. I bet that it is closer to 2500 mg.

Is there anything I can do about this? Is a such thing as a home test kit for salt content in foods?

How can I bust these companies and make them be honest?

Yes I have tried calling and complaining and that has got me nowhere </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe this isn't right up the Reddit alley, but screw it I'm going to tell my story anyway.

It's 1999, about 11 PM. I'm standing on a cliff overlooking the Monterey Bay just south of Santa Cruz California. To my left I can see the city lights of  Monterey,  ahead of me is the Pacific Ocean.

I notice a plane flying slowly over the city of Monterey. It circles around the city and I wait for it to land at the airstrip just outside the city. Instead it starts to circle slowly outwards over the Monterey Bay. It circles very very slowly and when it gets about 1000 yards out over the ocean, it stops in midair 

Okay fine I guess it's not a plane it's a helicopter. 

It starts to emit colorful flashing lights, green blue red and white. It starts flying in very very slow kind of  loop d loops, getting closer to where I'm standing on the shore. The craft stops in midair again, and the white light gets very very bright and it starts sweeping the entire length of the   beach. It sweeps over me and pauses for a moment, it is EXTREMELY bright. I'm starting to kind of freak out now wondering what's going on. It continues to sweep down the beach.

I tried to get a good look at the craft. It's dark and I'm straining to see it, and for all the world it looks somewhat disk shaped. I can see no propellers, no engines, no blades. But again it's very dark and I can't really make out very clearly. It was completely silent. the closest it got to me was maybe 500 yards and I could hear no engine noise.

Suddenly it turns back towards the city of Monterey, accelerates REALLY quickly with absolutely no noise whatsoever, swoops down and flies over the entire city of Monterey, turns back over the ocean, flies out  over the middle of Monterey Bay, and then

And here's where it gets freaky

It flies INTO the ocean. Yes that's right, it flew INTO the ocean. I know what I saw and I saw that craft flying into the ocean. I just stood there stunned not knowing what to think. I turned to look around to see if anybody else saw it, and  there was one other guy maybe 30 yards from me. I walked over to him and asked if he'd seen it. He just looked at me with his mouth gaping open unable to speak. I looked back at the ocean trying to find the craft, when I turned back to find the guy again he was literally RUNNING for his car. He got in his car peeled out and took off like a bat out of hell.

Went home and for the next couple days was looking for news reports about an airplane that crashed into the bay. Nothing.

I still have no idea what the hell I saw. it did not look like it crashed into the ocean. It looked very much like it fully intended to fly into the Bay. I don't know.

TL;DR: saw a strange totally silent craft, that emitted multicolored lights, fly INTO the Monterey Bay. </TEXT>

They air old reruns from 1999 through 2003, late at night here. I ALWAYS laugh at them. Even when I'm tired and groggy. I can't help but laugh because well They're fucking hilarious!

This season I really WANT to laugh, I EXPECT to laugh, but mostly I just don't. I chuckle a little bit here and there but the comedy seems less incisive  or cutting to me. I'm just not feeling it.

Do you find South Park as funny as it's always been? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2012-02-16 18:45:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been reading studies which show the critical importance of the K/Na ratio in the human body. In most Americans, the ratio GREATLY favors sodium, but studies have shown when the ratio is equal or when K is favored, significant health benefits are experienced.

And yet, if you fry up some vegetables and season half with potassium chloride and the other half with sodium chloride, and do a taste test, close to 100% will be repulsed by the vegetables seasoned with potassium chloride and will gobble down the veggie seasoned with sodium chloride. 

WHY?

Why would we evolve to be repulsed by the taste of one electrolyte we really really need. And yet crave another electrolyte we also need? it just doesn't make sense to me.

Here's some of the stuff I've been reading. the first link is pretty dense with medical jargon, I provided a short excerpt from the second link.

http://cardiovascres.oxfordjournals.org/content/37/2/335.full

After 31 months, they found that compared to the homes which still used table salt (NaCl) in their kitchens, in the homes where a salt mixture with equal amounts of potassium and sodium had been substituted for NaCl, there was a statistically significant:

39% drop in cardiovascular disease
70% decrease in heart failure
50% decrease in cerebral vascular disease
and a 25% drop (though not statistically significant) in diabetes (which I had predicted in the 1980s).

An important aspect of this study is the fact that the K/Na ratio in the salt replacement was only 1/1.  In my book, "The High Blood Pressure Solution," you will find evidence that when the dietary K/Na ratio is above a threshold (between 2 and 4 - close to 3),  problems such as hypertension, become rare. </TEXT>
