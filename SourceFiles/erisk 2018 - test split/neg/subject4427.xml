<TEXT> I have been luck enough to travel through Europe a few times. I would recommend the Nikon 18-140mm for a general walk around lens. I would also take a 35mm f1.8 for indoor shots inside castles or  other buildings and walking around at night. I have been to most of the places you are planning to visit so if you have any questions, feel free to PM me. Have fun! </TEXT>

The next is to see how many shots are on the shutter. Take a [picture and upload](https://www.camerashuttercount.com/) to check.

<TEXT> Hello, I heard a heavy/ prog rock album playing at a music store. When I asked the guy working behind the counter what it was,  he told me the name of the band and showed me the cover. I thought to myself; "I'm smart, of course I'll remember the name." Well I didn't. I do remember the album cover had a Venetian doctor, I believe, in a dark circle, on it. I think it was a newer album (2013+). This might be a long shot but any guesses would be greatly appreciated! </TEXT>

The best of our leaders  think Abraham Lincoln  have been sure about the truth and uncertain about themselves. Trump is the opposite. His mind is uncluttered by creeds. He knows what he wants at any given moment, but it can bear little relation to the moment following. Who really believes that he would be sleepless if the wall were not built or if NAFTA ultimately survived? Who believes he would not be sleepless because of a nasty joke at his expense during a dinner party?"

<TEXT> I have shot with both the Tamron 10-24mm and the Sigma 10-20mm. The copy of the Sigma I had was not sharp and I was very unimpressed. I bought the Tamron and I have found it to be a very pleasing looking lens. Though, I will note that it looses some sharpness wide open, however  I feel that the Tamron has character.  I have not tried the Tokina 11-20mm but It seems to have some very good reviews and it is a little faster than the Tamron or the Sigma. It might also be worth looking into the Rokinon 14mm, which is a great lens for the price, if you don't mind manual focusing all the time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Take a look at the AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-140mm f/3.5-5.6G ED VR. It is a nice walk around lens with a useful zoom range. I have seen them refurbished for about $250.00. If your budget is small, then I would look at the D5000 series. It will take similar quality pictures to the D7000 series, but are smaller and less costly.  I almost always buy Nikon refurbished to save money and have never had a problem.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello student loan gurus, I previously used your services to help my girlfriend (now wife) make some headway on on her (now our) student loans. They are (all variable rates):

Navient (Public)- $55,000 total over 6 loans.
3 subsidized at 6.8% interest ($17,000) and 3 which are unsubsidized: (1.) $14,500 @ 6.8% (2.) $20,000 @ 6.8% (3.) $18,000 @ 5.625%

NJ Class Managed by HESAA (Private)- $69,000 Total over 6 loans. 2 loans currently in repayment totaling $13,200 @ 7.2%. 1 loan currently in repayment totaling $3,600 @ 6.74%. 2 loans currently in repayment totaling $28,400@ 6.5%. 1 loan currently in repayment totaling $23,700 @ 6.7%.

So in total we have $123,000 total owed. We recieved an offer from Navient to refinance and consolidate all of her loans at a fixed 4.65%. This reduces the payment from $1600 to $1300 per month and is a 10 year plan. This seems pretty good, however, she is currently working as postdoc at a state university and has an offer to stay on as a assistant professor. I know that some public loans can be forgiven, however, I am not sure that in 120 payments, there will be enough left on the loan to justify the higher interest rate. I am wondering if it makes more sense to consolidate everything or keep the public loans separate? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello I was hoping that you could help me with my girlfriends student loans. She pays over $700 a month on these loans but the balance remains the same! 

She has loans with:

Navient (Public)- $55,000 total over 6 loans.  
3 subsidized at 6.8% interest ($17,000) and 3 which are unsubsidized: 
(1.) $14,500 @ 6.8% 
(2.) $20,000 @ 6.8% 
(3.) $18,000 @ 5.625% 

NJ Class Managed by HESAA (Private)- $69,000 Total over 6 loans.
2 loans currently in repayment totaling $13,200 @ 7.2%.
1 loan currently in repayment totaling $3,600 @ 6.74%.
2 loans currently in deferment totaling $28,400@ 6.5%.
1 loan currently in deferment totaling $23,700 @ 6.7%.

All of the Navient loans are currently being differed because she is still in school.

She always pays $365 a month on her NJCLASS loans currently in repayment, and another $335 a month on the NJCLASS loans currently in deferment. Regarding the NJCLASS loans, the balance never seems to go down. She has tried to consolidate both public and private loans with NJ Class and SoFI but was told that she can not refinance while in school. The private loans are all undergraduate and the public loans are from undergrad and masters. She expects to graduate in September of this year. 

We would appreciate any advice you may be able to give us. Thank you so much for any recommendations you may have!

And sorry for the formatting I am not very good at this!

<TITLE> Rebuild transmission fails after multiple returns to shop. Warrantee expires this week! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-10-14 00:25:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello I could use your legal advice. 

I am from the state of New Jersey

On November 20, 2014 I paid a transmission shop to rebuild the automatic transmission in my 2000 Subaru Impreza with 100,000 miles. The car had a manufacturer defect, which causes the car not to go into drive. It is problem on virtually every Subaru from that era and the fix is well known. It is called delayed forward engagement.

The shop said that the rest of the transmission was in bad shape too and it needed to be rebuilt. They said that they worked on these all the time and I paid $1400 for the rebuild and an additional $400 for the timing belt, since it was due and I planned on keeping the car.  I am the type of person who does all scheduled maintenance. This included a 12-month, 12000 mile warrantee. 

Less then 24 hours after I had the transmission rebuilt, it would not go into gear and I nearly got hit after backing into traffic. I took it back and they claimed that it was fixed properly but the computer was remembering that there was a problem and was replicating it. They claimed to then replace the transmission computer. 

Less then a month later it was back. In fact I brought it back at least 2 more times (I have to look at my paperwork). Each time they said they made adjustments. They did not want to give me paperwork for each visit but I insisted. 

Eventually the car seemed to work for about 3 months. That was until this past week. The car stopped shifting and I had to abandon it. I brought the car to the shop with 10 days left on the warrantee (4 days ago).

Today I called and they said that they needed my original paperwork. I brought it over and they said that it was going to take them a while. They couldnt tell me what is wrong with the transmission but they needed my paperwork to send to their warrantee company to get money back on the parts that failed but they need an inspector to come and see if I abused the transmission (I went less then 8000 miles). They said they lost their paperwork on my car. 

A few things: I dont think they actually rebuilt the transmission in the first place. Each time I drop the car off it takes them over a week. They dont call me when its done. I have to keep calling them. Each time they have the car, they have it for a week and I do not have another vehicle. I have to get rides to work and to the shop. 
I have not paid more then the original $1800. Each fix has been under the warrantee.  What work I can see, was done poorly. This includes fluids spilled over the hood and sides of the car/engine compartment, missing bolts for the weather cover which was left to dangle and was dragging on the road, and the windshield washer tubing was removed and never put back. 

I really dont know what to do. Should I demand my money back? Can I? Should I take them to small claims court? Am I SOL? Please help!

TLDR: Paid $1800 for Rebuilt transmission and scheduled maintenance. Transmission never worked correctly after rebuild failed again this week after several returns to the shop. Warrantee is expiring this week. Shop says they need to hold on to the car to get it inspected from parts insurance adjuster. What should I do?

<TEXT> Story time: Several years ago I worked at a hardware store and there was a stock kid that was always bothering one of the cashiers. The stock kid was very obnoxious, he was the son of a local politician and ever sentence he spoke started with "my dad said". One of those people you just immediately want to punch in the face upon meeting them. Well one day the cashier had enough and she decided to pull a prank on him. Every 20 minutes or so this kid would go up to the front of the store, pull his mountain dew out of the mini fridge, drink it, and go talk to the cashier. She decided it would be a harmless prank to super glue the stock kids mountain dew lid so that he couldn't open it. So she superglued the lid and put it back in the mini fridge. Well we all learned that day that super glue doesn't cure when it's cold, at least not quickly. The stock kid went up and took his drink out of the fridge, opened it, and took a drink. The bottle immediately stuck to his lips, causing him to give a muffled yell as he run around the store, waving his arms in the air, with a mountain dew bottle attached to his mouth. After he pulled it off he claimed that he ended up with minor chemical burns and demand that the store fire the cashier. Even got his dad to complain but the store never did anything other than making the cashier write an apology letter. He didn't bother her again after that. It was glorious.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello r/Subaru I was hoping some of you could help me with my 2000 Impreza OBS (automatic) with about 105k. Here is my brief story:

About a year ago I noticed my car was taking a long time to shift into drive (initially 5-15sec). All other gears were fine and once it was in gear it was fine. Over time it got worse. I then researched the problem and saw that it was a common issue and I found the fixed site which recommended that you add Trans-X.
Trans-X fixed the problem for about 4 months before it came back with a vengeance. I was experiencing delays of 10+ minutes! So I took it to a local transmission shop and they recommended a full rebuild for $1400. This included a 1yr warranty and I was hopeful that this would fix the issue (even though at that price I was doubtful that they would fully rebuild the whole thing) so I had it done in November. Unfortunately thats where it gets frustrating.
After the initial rebuild I had to bring it back 3 times:
1.	After the rebuild the issue was worse than ever. Sometimes there was over a 30min delay into drive. I brought it back and they claimed they made some adjustments and that it was fixed.
2.	Of course it wasn't fixed. Same exact issue so I brought it back again. This time they claimed that the transmission was fixed but the transmission computer was "remembering that there was an issue and was replicating it so they replaced the transmission computer.
3.	Again not fixed so I brought it back and after a week of adjustments I got it back and it seemed to work! 
Well it worked for about 3 months (2k miles) and it is now starting to come back. Experiencing 3-10sec delays into drive (intermittent). I have brought the ATRA service bulletin to them and they claim to have seen it and stated that they see the Subaru 4-AT transmission all the time and know how to fix it.
Any suggestions on how I can get this fixed would be really helpful. Basically, what can I tell the shop to do since it is still under warranty (other than where to shove it)? I love my Subaru and other than this problem the car seems perfect. 
Thanks!
