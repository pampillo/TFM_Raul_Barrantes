<TEXT> I've read most of Golding's novels, and just finished Rites of Passage, which was awarded the Man Booker Prize in 1980.

Can anyone help me appreciate what's exceptional about Rites? Especially compared to his other novels, it was surprisingly forgettable for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tip for softcore - you gain a total of +45 all resist from the rescuing Anya quest in Act 5 (+15 for each difficulty you complete it on). When you die, there is a bug that causes you to lose this resist bonus and this is NOT displayed on your Character stats page.

This won't matter probably until Hell difficulty, but best to just leave and re-enter a game to restore the bonus/grab body. </TEXT>

If so I would make Enigma personally. I have limited time to play so I play Sorc exclusively pretty much just because of speed. Enigma would allow me to branch out more and still be fast, especially summonmancer is one of my favs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Iirc Roland kills an entire town full of people in the first 50 pages of original series, that gives you an idea of the mood of the series. They took a very dark and unique series and turned it into some generic YA sludge. Actually a great way to get a feel for the series if interested is google "Gunslinger novel illustrations" - all the originals were illustrated by great artists, Michael Whelan, David McKean etc. </TEXT>

But I'd go with NM Countess for medium/low rarity runes (Lore, Smoke, Spirit). Your problem with Spirit is the 4os shield, which you won't get until A5 NM/Hell. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's boring but basically every build benefits most from A2 Mercs.

Personally, I spec mine for max physical melee damage: Might Aura (NM merc) with Guiliarms Face, Treachery armor, and Reaper's Toll scythe. If you look up those items you'll see you get a kickass physical element merc at fairly low cost/rarity of items. The rarest drop is the elite scythe, I got mine while moating Hell Mephisto.

FYI I don't have an option to mod bnet Ladder runewords into my single player, so I play without Infinity, Spirit etc. But for Bliz, I don't think I'd change my merc even if I was on Ladder.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've found it really hard to get away from Sorc. I play self found single player, so no Enigma runes yet. It just saves you massive time. I'd recommend Bliz Sorc. If you really want to be able to kill Cold immunes you can swap to Meteorb Sorc but you need a lot of +skill to be efficient in Hell with dual element. Straight Bliz is probably more efficient, you just need to build up a badass merc. 

I won't seriously try any other class until I have an Enigma for tele.

My goal for SP is to get a char for /players8 MF, but as far as I know only Hdins can pull that off. </TEXT>

Personally, I believe any kind of drawing on toned paper is the best way to practice because you can directly draw both the darks and lights. It's faster and more straightforward. </TEXT>

He once lied to me 2-3 times over a couple hours to get me to pick up and transport something for him. I had a car full of people and I could tell he felt humiliated once it became obvious to everyone what was going on. But he'd do it again no question. It's a compulsive behavior, like other addictions. I think a lot of hoarders can't stop without serious intervention. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A suggestion on drawing practice, try starting out with a 'quantity over quality' approach, doing a lot of quick sketches. Trying to fully realize a drawing while your learning is likely to be frustrating and if you don't have a coach to help you it's kind of fruitless. Sketch until you start doing it well and then move on to more completed drawings, sort of like rungs on a ladder.

If you like that idea try vine charcoal. Tone the paper by rubbing in a medium value of vine charcoal, and then you can draw by both using the charcoal and by 'erasing out' the lighter shapes.

Also you'd do well to pick up a drawing instructional book. Most of them are complete garbage (How to Draw Dogs!) but something like Tony Ryder's Figure Drawing can really help you improve dramatically because he guides you in a systematic approach to drawing that you can use on any subject. That's the kind of drawing instruction you get in a good school or atelier. </TEXT>

But then I start trying to think how to at some point get back on track to meet my wife and recreate my kids, which seems impossible. Assuming I could find and seduce my wife (likely enough) wouldn't the kids be new and different mixtures of baby batter? Not worth it. I like these ones. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I definitely agree. I think practically all people use philosophy. It probably has more of a meaningful impact on the lives of those who didn't study it formally because they don't use it as a detached exercise, they use it to set and adjust their way of life. I just wish more people had a better grasp of the science of philosophy and reason, more tools in their box. Education and exposure to information doesn't really increase someone's capacity for thought, but it provides context and a broader horizon. For example, I've often found that people present well-worn ideas as an original thought of their own, just because they have no idea that it's 1,000 years old and not novel or unique to them. They'd be better off with more context, 'here's the first known proponent of that idea and here are 10 arguments in response to it.' Very likely they would have a richer and maybe even different view afterwards. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Speaking from the experience of growing up in the US in public school I think it has a lot to do with education. I can count on one hand the number of times in high school I was expected to really think rather than memorize and regurgitate data. 

Whether people are aware of it or not philosophy will always be hugely significant. Everyone forms philosophies constantly, but today most people don't have the tools to step back and evaluate how and why they think the way they do. I think for most people they never will develop that, it is difficult after all, if it isn't prioritized and trained from a young age. </TEXT>

Also, the next Garg will be summoned whenever 1 of them hits 50% health, so it's best to focus on 1 at a time to slow down the summons. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hard to beat Sorc's unique abilities, especially 'free' teleporting - but Hell is quite difficult without dual elements, and that requires pretty developed gear. Trapsin is slower but you don't need to worry about immunes, plus some excellent survivability skills. And it's less gear dependent. You'll be slow without good gear, but you can definitely clear Hell.

For straight MF, you can't beat Blizzard if you're starting fresh. Bliz can MF certain Hell area practically naked. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some thoughts on Trapsin for HC: fade's res all / hidden dmg reduction %, ability to put practically all points in health, 2 elements on 1 skill tree + corpse explosion, spamable stun and meatshield. All of NM can be cleared practically naked, and with minimal gear Hell. With a lower resist wand on switch you can sort of get the Infinity effect for cheap (minus immunity breaking of course). Only real downside imo is the lack of teliport, but again, staff works. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Main reasons for me are mediocre connection, temp banning, ability to pause game (I can never play without interruptions), and infinite shared stash ala GoMule. I was playing Ladder until recently. I've also noticed it's more satisfying for me to self-find (so far anyway) and find leveling strategies. The static maps someone mentioned above are also a big plus to take some of the grind off of MF runs.

I thought I would miss the Ladder runewords but actually I don't. I realized a lot of those mid-range RW are pretty overpowered. I enjoy sorting through all the uniques I never bothered with before. For example, my merc has 85% crushing blow because of some random uni yari Id never seen before. I have no high runes, but I can up that to an elite which will be nearly as good as some of the runewords. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm newly returned from D3 and new to trading but economy seems functional to me (US West Ladder). I started later in season with zero gear. I can get a lot of items fairly cheap with the 2-3 valuable drops I can get myself while high value items like Enigma still will take me awhile to trade up for, but it's attainable. I would still enjoy playing equally if I self-found everything but if bots are driving trade pricing down doesn't seem like a bad thing to me.

One of the reasons I dropped D3 for D2 is that even when you have BiS gear in everything D2 is still fun for me, while for me D3 endgame has no more rewards.

Isn't Ladder climbing more of an issue? Seems like that's the only really competitive component of online play. </TEXT>

<TEXT> D2 Norm-NM can be done with no real need for high-end gear with practically any 2 player team - even Hell if you plan your builds carefully to compliment each other. (I'm assuming here that you were an experienced player before). Why not try it? It's a pretty inexpensive experiment and folks on this subreddit are really helpful if you need advice on a strong 2 player team build. </TEXT>

Trapsin can apply 3 elements if you prioritize Firebomb (Lightning, Firebomb, and Physical from Corpse Explosion) and is less reliant on a strong merc for immunes. </TEXT>

Drops are meaningful, the focus is on builds and gameplay over gear, yet gear is important for endgame (whereas in D3 gear is where you begin the real game, nothing happens till you have a 6p set and a handful of key legendaries)...no crafting materials, ya f u for that D3 devs. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Recently returned to D2 after giving up on D3. I mainly played single player before and would cut out 'the grind' as much as I could via hero editor and just focus on trying different builds.

Playing exclusively on Bnet now. Is there a really basic guide anyone can give me on farming up? Like suggested target/difficulty/MF for socketables, runes, and high quality legendaries respectively? I vaguely understand that high MF isn't always good and that I need a balance of kill speed vs. MF.

For example, I have nothing basically so need everything, but mainly socketables and runes - I can kill NM Meph with a little difficulty. Should I bump up to Hell and farm in A1 for elite socketables and runes or would I be better off staying in NM and running a variety of routes/MF levels?

And trading is completely new for me - is there a current simple guide anywhere on ladder trading?

Edit: I'm playing a lvl 65 Trapsin with scraps for gear, but up to about 120 MF. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that whole thing is largely an effect of the almost total destruction of insulated cultures and communities. Today they are all becoming connected, so people are much much more than ever before coming into contact with alien and radically different ideas and perspectives. A lot of people find that overwhelming or just aren't interested in expanding their sympathy and empathy that far beyond what they're accustomed to - yet they're still confronted with those ideas, so they resent them. It's especially easy to resent a foreign idea that's introduced via media rather than by an actual acquaintance or friend. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a millennial and I agree. I mean it's the standard baby-boomer critique but it's true. Some of that culture however is what we were trained to expect. I think each generation has some trouble with both overcompensating for what was missing from their upbringing and also not knowing how to reproduce the virtues their parents/experiences gave them for their own kids. The same recipe never works quite the same 20 years later and not all the same ingredients are available.
At any rate, personally I feel like it's on me to identify the virtues my grandfathers and fathers had and figure out a recipe that works for me today and, somehow, one that will work for my sons.
But it doesn't do any good to just say 'you're not like we were, why are you such pansies.' It's always difficult to communicate across generational divides, but the rewards are huge for both generations if it's achieved. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The ancients had this, imho really difficult to translate conception of the inner self, that vague as it is, still seems a damn good model. The kardia was imagined to contain the will, the thoughts, the 'eternal spark' of the soul all sort of flowing in and out of each other, but also distinct to some degree... Any attitude that amputates a essential component of being human is an impoverished and distorted perspective. And living a life that deliberately atrophies part of your humanity deforms you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well I think we're all at least a little uncomfortable with the idea that all human behavior and relationships are self-interested. But unpleasant or not it's fascinating. Because even self-sacrifice is often surprisingly rewarding. A lot of people would say much more rewarding than self-serving behavior. So that raises that question of whether or not it's really that sacrificial after all. And on the other hand, self-serving behavior has its costs, whether that's social or in self-esteem. Maybe they are ultimately just strategies of fulfillment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm with you in skepticism towards any attitude that dismisses emotion and intuition and is worshipful toward logic with a capital L. But even the blind spots and conceited rationalizations themselves are examples of flawed reasoning. Any really careful thinker learns to distrust themselves and at least tries their best to stay vigilant against their own biases and motivated rationalizations. Anyone claiming to possess logic as a character trait is making a bit of a fool of themselves (me included since I'm definitely guilty of that). It's not a character trait, it's a method that's only as good as its application at the moment, and even at its best has limitations. In addition to that, reasoning is only as good as the "data" you're using, so even when we reason carefully we can trip over a mistaken assumption or a hidden premise. Reason in practice produces a humility about the whole enterprise reminiscent of the attitude you find in basic research scientists about their work. They know the task of completely unraveling even a small fragment of the universe is always beyond their grasp and the limitations of their instruments, but they just do the best they can with what they have knowing that though slow and imperfect their progress is real and based on a sound method. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since I was in college myself in early 2000's I've been discussing philosophy and religion with students continuously. It's striking how rare it is to find someone who's learned critical thinking. It's like an archaic lost language.
I can't judge how we compare to other generations, but I personally believe it's in part a symptom of a shift in the purpose of education away from liberal arts and 'learning to think and communicate clearly' to multiple choice exams and preparation to pursue a specific job or career. People maybe are learning to think critically in their field but it's compartmentalized and not a tool they use in a general way.
I think an aversion to labor, maybe especially intellectual labor, is part of human nature. If there isn't any effort made to highlight the general importance and value of rationality then the average person will tend to 'skip it', or leave it to others to do the thinking for them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> On LSD:
Started slow, first hallucination I remember was textures on surfaces moving (like wood grain moving like water for example). I remember the pupils in my two friends eyes looked like holes, and telling them I could see inside their heads. By that time we were driving around in a convertible at night, I remember a kind of similar effect to the eye thing where I had a kind of x-ray vision, I could see through houses and trees etc.
Later on it definitely messed with my judgment and made me less inhibited, kind of like alcohol. Did some stupid stuff involving an ex.
After that I had a kind of dream-state spirit quest kind of thing, but it was abstract, difficult to describe, although I could try if someone's really interested..
I didn't sleep at all. Towards morning I just sat and talked with my buddy for hours, no hallucinations by that time.
I didn't feel normal for a few days and ultimately decided not to ever do a hallucinogenic again. A. I liked it more than anything else I'd ever tried and didn't trust myself not to abuse it. B. It bothered me how long it took to wear off. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I definitely empathize.
My solution is greatshield + Estoc or Spears (Heide spear is good b/c they are weak to lightning). Focusing  on one at a time (turtling and using over-the-shield strikes when you can't get clean shots in safely) is important because whenever 1 garg is down to 50% health, a new garb will join the fight. It takes patience and usually a good stock of healing items but I kill them this way reliably every new play through, including a NG+ round for the +2 gold serpent ring for farming. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since a couple folks asked about toughness: For toughness options you have Endless Walk set, Garwulf+Zoey's, Unity/Elusive Ring, Perma Vengeance-Dark Heart (requires stacking CDR which sacrifices damage), Aquila, and a gem like Esoteric or Gizzard. You can actually use ALL of these at the same time for essentially infinite toughness. The top ranking players are dropping some of that ridiculous toughness for added damage. For example, using Vengeance on cooldown instead of permanent so you can add area damage etc. in place of CDR. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Recently became friends with a blind dude. He's been blind basically since birth. We haven't discussed sex yet but he showed me how he 'watches movies' - its a program that narrates all the visual info in real time with the film. Anyway, while I was listening to the movie with him I realized I was of course automatically visualizing it (I'm a visual artist). I asked him what he imagines when he hears it. He said he imagines sensations mostly. Like for example the scene we were hearing was in a snowy winter landscape. I realized I would never have thought about how that cold would have felt to the characters. It was actually really interesting but challenging to try to experience the story like he does without visualizing it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 
Pick a media: Obviously it's great to experiment with everything, but it's important IMO to pick a primary media and work on mastering it. Most of the time for now you want to be focusing on drawing without being surprised or distracted by what you're drawing with. Tried and true graphite on white paper is perfectly fine. One idea I'll also suggest is using toned paper with both black and white charcoal/conte pencils etc. This allows you apply highlights directly with the white on grey paper instead of subtractively (leaving an area blank or erasing it). It's faster and simpler media-wise, which again allows more focus on what you're doing.

Copying Photos: You can see yourself I'm sure how your realism improved from copying photos. That is a great way to get familiar with your materials and what they can do and practice basic technique. There are some problems you will get into if you work exclusively from photos and don't learn to draw from life but as long as you are aware of that it's no problem.

Drawing from Life: Every really excellent draftsman or painter trains from life. Period. There are countless ways to do it. Sketching people at a mall or busy street will improve your speed and teach you to capture a lot of info with a few marks... Portraits and figures are by far the best way to grow because they are the most challenging (I can go more into why if you want). Self-portraits are the best way to practice a portrait (because you can completely control the 'model', lighting etc with no time limits). 

The primary difference between excellent drawing and average is not technique or anything material, it's mental. Most 'how to draw' books/materials are useless because they usually don't teach you how to think properly about drawing. Check out Tony Ryder's book (I'll edit the title in when I get home). It covers those things really well and is full of inspiring examples of excellent figure drawing and portraits.

As you begin to master drawing from life, you will then begin to be able to draw much more convincingly from imagination, which for me anyway is the ultimate goal: to be able to draw anything I can imagine.

PM if you want any more info on some artists to check out or anything else. I love sharing what I've learned and I've been fortunate in having some great mentors. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As an undying being surrounded by mortal men in close confinement it is always being impressed on me: my luxury. I have a luxury that quite simply cannot be bought. In my lifetimes I've seen a seemingly infinite and sometimes horrifying variety of things exchanged for a coin - but no one can buy this luxury. There is no greater degree of indulgence and extravagance on earth than that which I possess - endless days...endless nights.

I allowed myself to be falsely accused, arrested and convicted on a lark. A diversion. An experiment. What was unexpected was that the burden of finite life lost weighing on the men around me would sharpen and enhance my own sensation of freedom. I have found a 'high' the like of which I've never known in my countless decades. </TEXT>

I discovered that layering different levels of hardness helps cut gloss too, kind of like layering oil paint - it's time consuming though, and at some point the paper tooth can get 'over-saturated' if you're not careful.

<TEXT> If you are new to DS2 (sounds like you are) I would suggest freely upgrading regular titanite weapons up to +6 and then stopping there to focus on 1-3 weapons to take to +10. You get access to infinite supply of mats for +1-6 relatively early on but on your first play-through chunks are more difficult to get a hold of. +6 is plenty high enough for testing!
Also FYI Longsword is one of the better weapons for PvP and a great weapon to start with to learn the game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Spears or Greatswords are good for countering opponents with fast light weapons because you outreach them but are still fast enough to recover from a wiff and dodge attacks. In a gank squad scenario something like a claymore would seem better because of it's wide angle attacks? I don't have a whole lot of experience being outnumbered though FYI. When I am I can usually spot the weaker link quickly and focus them down.

<TEXT> I tend to obsessively remake characters and play through up to 150 and then restart so some ideas to try: As melee: 1. Strength build 2. Dex build 3. Quality build (goal is to max both Str and Dex, some weapons benefit equally from both stats, also good way to explore a variety of weapons). To get familiar with different spell types you could do hybrid builds that use melee and casting, like for example a Dex/Int build that uses light weapons like rapier and katanas with sorcery. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not exactly held hostage but similar maybe: Once a friend and I were visiting another friend living on a US military base. Apparently some kids we ran into at the park on base accused us of threatening them with knives. About 10 black SUV's rolled up, split us up, searched and interrogated us for about an hour (me in particular). At one point they brought the ringleader kid by in a vehicle and had him confirm I was the one who threatened him. I was about 10% pissed that the kid was playing games with military security and the other 90% grateful I was in the US instead of a country where I would have been thrown in a hole somewhere, guilty until proven innocent. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's always going to be subjective of course. Examples of douchy behavior in my opinion: 1.Using Heal Spells/Estus in duels (no problem if invaded) unless your opponent has the same option (like dragon covenant etc.) 2. Starting a duel and then hiding etc. 3. A lot of people argue certain weapons/builds are unfair or OP but I try to just focus on learning to counter those tactics - most people who use cheap gimmicks will be rekt as soon as that 1 option fails. I find DS2 PvP overall is very balanced once you get the basics down and are familiar with most weapons capabilities. At this point I enjoy losing to a superior player more than defeating an average player. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been playing vanilla on PS3 since I bought the game about a year ago, co-op ranges from 'OK' to non-existent. I've been doing mostly SL150(1-3M SM) PvP on Iron Bridge last couple months with a little Arena (but screw Arena, douche central). 'Jolly Co-op' is harder to find than PvP in my experience. It's not terrible all the time though as most comments here on reddit suggest.
Edit: Btw, I have noticed that I am routinely paired with players who have DLC (I have none yet). I don't know if that means I'm being paired with SOTFS PS3 players or vanilla guys with DLC...or both. </TEXT>

Recently someone invaded me on a fresh char and gave me a +10 Zweinhander (an Invadebro lol) so I tried that and realized the 2H L2 can utilize the Leo ring buff for 1k+ hits, not a fan so much of the rest of its move-set though...

<TEXT> Some general advice that I picked up recently when I started focusing more on PvP: PvP success is mostly about timing, spacing, and knowledge/experience with your opponents weapons   techniques. What really helped me improve was focusing on using the same all-around effective weapons and improving those fundamentals and just getting used to different types of opponents. Oh and a quality build is a good first pick for dedicated PvP to use a test-pilot for various weapons. GL! </TEXT>

He also has high armor and HP, so you need a decently upgraded weapon - the longer the fight the more likely you are to make mistakes and get creamed.

I decided to GR with FoK Shadow which can easily reach mid-high 80's and is easy to gear and fun imo (actually very similar pull   nuke play to LoN). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Early in the season the best performing builds seemed to be ones using Karlei's Point and stacking area dmg, eventually people even dropped Seethe and combined Dark Heart and Aquila relying totally on Karlei's for resource. I never really enjoyed that build as much as FoK but no one thought FoK could compete - then I saw a 80GR clear with FoK and I jumped back in lol. It's hard to see how Karlei's can possibly compete now that Lord Greenstone's Fan has it's effect doubled but the high toughness may become required higher up?
Lightbeams 80 clear was the highest Shadow I found on Season board, and I've been told someone using Karlei version cleared as high as 81-82. If that means the two build were roughly tied the doubled boost for FoK should push it ahead for sure dmg-wise, but FoK relies almost totally on mobility for survival so that may become a problem. </TEXT>

I'm a casual of the family and job variety but I cleared a GR77 (currently #625) despite a very mediocre Fan (162/200 FoK boost) on PTR, I'm happy to do something if no one more qualified is interested?

Edit: Added a guide below, hopefully someone can do a better one soon!

<TEXT> Thanks a lot for replying!
- I have an Uhkapian, I was experimenting with stacking CDR, I'll try switching back.
- A lot of what I was unsure about was Leg. Gem choice: I just swapped out the gems I was using on my DH. Do PetDocs mostly use the standard Enforcer/Trapped/Powerful set?
- I didn't realize TGF would proc Trapped - Was about to experiment with Wave of Mutilation or Frozen P. Is it worth the loss of the Nado CC w/ no Flayer?
- I figured my Arcane ammy is going to be tough to beat unless I get very lucky, immunity to jailer is hard to let go for any reason.
- I'll try swapping the dog.
- I have never seen a SMK or Flayer, but I only put in about 200 para levels maining WD, guess I can ride WD lootshare for awhile and see if my luck hits. I don't see pushing too high into +30G without a dagger drop. I found a PetDoc in the top 40 solo leaderboard but he had SMK of course, he was at 34-35 I think... </TEXT>

<TEXT> - Reroll/recraft shoulder and armor + mojo for up to 45% dog dmg
- recraft bracer for fire% to match other elemental boosts

Beyond those tweaks you already have very good gear, nothing is going to give you a significant boost except for TnT. With that you should be able to easily farm T6. I have a near perfect TnT with worse rolls on everything else than you, plus I don't have Flayer, and I still farm T6 comfortably.

Gambling for TnT with a Wiz slightly improves your odds. You could also try Rift-It-Forward community to speed up gambling. </TEXT>

Kind of weird though about T5, I have trouble keeping FS up, I think because my dog is killing too fast to get many procs? I wonder if I'd be better off with Zuni when under T6... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Go with Lethorio's advice, you'll be stuck in low Torments using Quetz w/out Jade - entry level Pet doc will be stronger, and more fun in my experience. Keep gambling for Jeram, it's not difficult to get (actually more common than Quetz) </TEXT>

I know my damage is low, but still having a hard time imagining enjoying Jade more than Pets - I'm getting hit constantly by mobs, do Jade WD's stack toughness? Seems impossible to avoid taking lots of damage with the short range of harvest...

Please talk me into continuing Jade lol </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for the detailed response! What I'm taking away is that elemental is secondary to your basic damage stats (more so than I realized anyway) and that +damage/CC/CHD/AS should be the first priority, elemental will provide a secondary bonus to whatever skill set is chosen, with likelihood that fire is slightly better in T6 due to difficulty of keeping 15 FS up constantly. Sound right? </TEXT>
