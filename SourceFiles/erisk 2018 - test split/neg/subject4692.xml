<TEXT> [Here](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/column-psychology-behind-clowns-creep-us/) is a column by one of the authors of the McAndrew and Koehnke (2016) article "On the nature of creepiness" discussing the psychology behind why clowns creep us out.

He notes that

 The results are consistent with the hypothesis that being creeped out is an evolved adaptive emotional response to ambiguity about the presence of threat that enables us to maintain vigilance during times of uncertainty.

Essentially, clowns may disrupt some heuristic we have for how things are supposed to be.

He further notes that:

 This is perfectly consistent with my hypothesis that it is the inherent ambiguity surrounding clowns that make them creepy. They seem to be happy, but are they really? And theyre mischievous, which puts people constantly on guard. People interacting with a clown during one of his routines never know if they are about to get a pie in the face or be the victim of some other humiliating prank. The highly unusual physical characteristics of the clown (the wig, the big red nose, the makeup, the odd clothing) only magnify the uncertainty of what the clown might do next.

The article lists factors for creepiness (correlations in parentheses)- you can see that a lot of them can apply to clowns.

<TEXT> Hi there,

The peer-reviewed title for the first post is almost identical to the post title, and describes the finding of the research, so it is fine:

Meltzer, A. L. (2017). Wives with masculine husbands report increased marital satisfaction near peak fertility. *Evolutionary Behavioral Sciences*, *11*(2), 161-172. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/ebs0000083 

As for the second one, it slipped through and has since been removed. If you see anything (posts and comments) that you feel violates the sub rules, please report them so the mods can review it. 

As for this research, the paper can be found [here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886917303094). The NYMag title is considered clickbait because it doesn't tell the reader which Big 5 trait predicts domestic nudity - you have to "click" to learn which trait is it. The other problem is that the title focuses on the sexiest findings of the research, instead of describing the research fully (see the Highlights part in the abstract). The researchers explored Big Five associations with a large range of everyday behavioral acts as can be seen [here](http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/science/2017/05/04/04-big-five-personality.jpg). The abstract concludes that "findings may help ground trait scores in emblematic acts, and enrich understanding of mundane or common behavioral signatures of the Big Five" which is really the key takeaway.

<TEXT> **Abstract**

Different family composition and size inevitably make only-children different from non-only-children. Previous studies have focused on the differences in behaviors, such as cognitive function and personality traits, between the only-child and the non-only-child. However, there are few studies that have focused on the topic of whether different family environments influence childrens brain structural development and whether behavior differentially has its neural basis between only-child and non-only-child status. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the differences in cognition (e.g., intelligence and creativity) and personality and the anatomical structural differences of gray matter volume (GMV) using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) between only-children and non-only-children. The behavioral results revealed that only-children exhibited higher flexibility scores (a dimension of creativity) and lower agreeableness scores (a dimension of personality traits) than non-only-children. Most importantly, the GMV results revealed that there were significant differences in the GMV between only-children and non-only-children that occurred mainly in the brain regions of the supramarginal gyrus, which was positively correlated with flexibility scores; the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which was positively correlated with agreeableness scores; and the parahippocampal gyrus. These findings may suggest that family environment (i.e., only-child vs. non-only-child), may play important roles in the development of the behavior and brain structure of individuals.

<TEXT> This is interesting in light of research that shows that individuals who simply fantasize about a future success rather than plan for it tend to exert less effort and consequently have significantly lower rates of success (Holahan   Moos, 1986; Lengua   Sandler, 1996; Oettingen   Mayer, 2002; Ried, Dubow,   Carey, 1995). 

Also, it's sometimes the case that individuals who indulge in positive fantasies about future successes experience psychological enjoyment in the present which reduces their incentive to actively pursue the goal in the immediate future (McClelland, Koestner,   Weinberger, 1989; Oettingen   Mayer, 2002). 

I guess daydreaming could influence your creativity, but too much of it might have consequences for goal pursuit if it isn't really plan-focused. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Abstract**

A field experiment tested the effect of choosing a favorite role model on sense of fit in science among middle school girls. The girls participated in a 1-day science outreach event where they were exposed to multiple female role models. At the end of the event, participants were randomly assigned to choose and write about a favorite role model or to choose and write about their best friend. Girls in the role model choice condition experienced a significant increase in sense of fit in science, whereas girls in the control condition did not. Girls in the role model choice condition also tended to have stronger role model identification than girls in the control condition, and role model identification was correlated with sense of fit in science. Encouraging girls to actively choose and write about a favorite role model may help to maximize the impact of exposure to role models.

<TEXT> **Abstract**

Dogmatic intolerancedefined as a tendency to reject, and consider as inferior, any ideological belief that differs from ones ownis often assumed to be more prominent at the political right than at the political left. In the present study, we make two novel contributions to this perspective. First, we show that dogmatic intolerance is stronger among left- and right-wing extremists than moderates in both the European Union (Study 1) as well as the United States (Study 2). Second, in Study 3, participants were randomly assigned to describe a strong or a weak political belief that they hold. Results revealed that compared to weak beliefs, strong beliefs elicited stronger dogmatic intolerance, which in turn was associated with willingness to protest, denial of free speech, and support for antisocial behavior. We conclude that independent of content, extreme political beliefs predict dogmatic intolerance.

<TEXT> It wan't about missing data as u/Austion66 implied - they didn't analyze the data from those 14 Black participants because they weren't interested in intergroup perceptions (i.e., how Blacks perceive other Blacks) at that time (and didn't have a large enough n to do so anyway). Removing them from analyses effectively controls for the effect -whatever it may be. They addressed intergroup perceptions in Study 4 where they recruited equal #s of each race (Black, White) as well as gender (Male, Female). 

We conducted Study 4 as an exploratory investigation of whether the relationship between misperceptions of size and harm capability among Black and White targets would differ according to participants race. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That is an incorrect stereotype -- individuals with autism can read emotions and feel empathy. Here's an article that discusses the overlap between autism and alexithymia, a condition defined by a difficulty understanding and identifying ones own emotions. The authors found that:

 Individuals with autism but not alexithymia show typical levels of empathy, whereas people with alexithymia (regardless of whether they have autism) are less empathic. So autism is not associated with a lack of empathy, but alexithymia is.

We think these results, and the others we have found since, disprove the theory that autism impairs emotion recognition. If people assume that someone with autism lacks empathy, they will be wrong about half the time (because only half of individuals with autism have alexithymia).

<TEXT> The first survey is composed of 14 statements, the second is composed of 16 statements. Pts are asked to rate their agreement with each using a 5-pt Likert (1=strongly disagree, 5=strongly agree). The statements are messy in that there isn't correspondence between the surveys (e.g., words were added, removed), but there are a handful of statements where the only thing that changes is the subject. An example of one of these statement is: Survey 1: "I can related to my grade 12 school teachers"; Survey 2: "I can relate to the Program X mentors". Like you suggest, my plan was to present the results of these surveys descriptively... describing pts reflections on school, and then describing their reflections on the program. 

To me, they ultimately used a pre-post *design*, but not a measure that lends itself to pre-post analyses. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks so much for your thoughtful response. Yes, agree, it is a very weak design (wasn't mine - honest!). Cannot say anything about causality w/o random assignment. 

Actually, looking closer at the surveys, they did something else that is very strange. The first survey concerns pts reflections on their experiences in their regular classroom, while the second survey (6 wks later) asks them about their experiences in the program "alternative" classroom. So, I am not even sure if it is appropriate to do the t-test anymore since the questions are about different experiences. Does that make sense?

<TEXT> Hello: I am helping with some analyses and I am wondering what test I should be using for **unmatched** pre-post data. The same group of youth completed the pre and the post 6 wks apart, although fewer completed the post as some dropped out of the program.

From what I have read, a paired samples t-test is inappropriate because the data is unmatched, and an independent samples t-test would violate the assumption that the groups are independent. Should I just use an independent t-test and sacrifice the power? Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be fair, there is a substantial body of research critiquing the Big Five. Critiques concern issues with factor analysis and the unorthogonality of the factors (see [Musek, 2007](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656607000256)), inherent problems with lexical analysis (see [Trofimova, 2014](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0085677)), and the non-theoretical basis for the model (see [Eysenck, 1992](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/019188699290237J)), for example. [Musek (2007)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656607000256) discusses The Big One - what u/ieatbabiesftl was alluding to (I think), as well as u/hollth1 and u/PsychoPhilosopher.

Block outlines pretty compelling arguments in his [(1995)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7724687) and [(2010)](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10478401003596626) papers.

 The five-factor conceptualization of personality has been presented as all-embracing in understanding personality and has even received authoritative recommendation for understanding early development. I raise various concerns regarding this popular model. More specifically, (a) the atheoretical nature of the five-factors, their cloudy measurement, and their inappropriateness for studying early childhood are discussed; (b) the method (and morass) of factor analysis as the exclusive paradigm for conceptualizing personality is questioned and the continuing nonconsensual understandings of the five-factors is noted; (c) various unrecognized but successful efforts to specify aspects of character not subsumed by the catholic five-factors are brought forward; and (d) transformational developments in regard to inventory assessment of personality are mentioned. I conclude by suggesting that repeatedly observed higher order factors hierarchically above the proclaimed five may promise deeper biological understanding of the origins and implications of these superfactors.

<TEXT> The authors make no such claims (I can send you the paper if you want - or you could e-mail the author directly - he got back to me very quickly). As noted in the Abstract, they studied Jewish Israelis and Muslim Palestinians and that is it. The quote discussed above is from the Significance section - not the Abstract. Note the language that the authors used:

 "Beliefs about God **may** promote more equal valuation of human life regardless of religious identity, encouraging application of universal moral rules to believers and nonbelievers alike. "

This is a point that the authors likely brought up in the Discussion/Future Directions section(s) of the paper (it is standard for researchers to ponder the implications of their work in these sections... which usually end with "Future research is needed..."). They are not claiming anything beyond the scope of their research. 

I agree, though, it would be very interesting to conduct this study with different religious groups, and like you said, consider magnitudes of belief. The authors discuss this themselves in their Discussion section.

The authors were examining relations between Jewish Israelis and Muslim Palestinians only (their main DV was ingroup bias). To criticize the paper for making "proclamations about nonbelievers when they weren't included in the study in the first place" as tomrhod did simply means that s/he misinterpreted the meaning of 'nonbelievers' in the first place, and misinterpreted the point of the study.

 The Internet is now an integral, even inescapable part of many peoples daily lives; they turn to it to send messages, read news, conduct business and much more. But recent scientific reports have begun to focus on the preoccupation some people develop with certain aspects of the Internet, particularly online games. The gamers play compulsively, to the exclusion of other interests, and their persistent and recurrent online activity results in clinically significant impairment or distress. People with this condition endanger their academic or job functioning because of the amount of time they spend playing. They experience symptoms of withdrawal when kept from gaming. ... At this time, the criteria for this condition are limited to Internet gaming and do not include general use of the Internet, online gambling or social media. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree, the issue of stigma is an important one to address, and I discussed it elsewhere in the thread. There is definitely stigma attached to gaming, and people may (incorrectly) regard it as strange, odd, or even anti-social at times. I think that any activity that someone uses to distract themselves from properly coping/dealing with a psychological disorder, or an activity that causes someone to risk opportunities (e.g., employment) or relationships, or any of the other criteria, is typically not ideal. But, again, it all depends on the patient and their unique context. The Internet and gaming culture is relatively new (and isn't going away anytime soon), so scientists are playing a bit of catch up. The fact that these authors discuss the pros and cons of brain network hyperconnectivity suggests an important shift in discourse, though. 

Concerning the criteria, I found this recent [publication](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2014-57712-001/) that tested the reliability and validity of 4 survey instruments to measure IGD on the basis of the 9 criteria from the DSM5. Results:

 The psychometric properties of these scales were tested among a representative sample of 2,444 Dutch adolescents and adults, ages 1340 years. Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated that the structural validity (i.e., the dimensional structure) of all scales was satisfactory. Both types of assessment (polytomous and dichotomous) were also reliable (i.e., internally consistent) and showed good criterion-related validity, as indicated by positive correlations with time spent playing games, loneliness, and aggression and negative correlations with self-esteem, prosocial behavior, and life satisfaction. **The dichotomous 9-item IGD scale showed solid psychometric properties and was the most practical scale for diagnostic purposes**.

<TEXT> Your example, termed exercise addiction in some circles, falls under the 'behavioural addiction' umbrella term. Right now, gambling is the only behavioural (i.e., non-substance) addiction in the [DSM-5](http://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm/dsm-5). Research on behavioural addictions is certainly ongoing, with APA recognizing the need for further research (in the case of IGD). 

Another important thing to note is that with any behavioural addiction, there is often a significant degree of comorbidity with other diagnosable mental health disorders:

 About 86% of Internet addiction cases have some other DSM-IV diagnosis present. [source](http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.07101556)

What this means is that it is possible that an exercise disorder, or an Internet gaming disorder, may simply be a symptom of something else. It is clear that more research is needed, which is why APA listed IGD in [DSM-5](http://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm/dsm-5) Section III. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, some research does suggest that. I found [this](http://journals.lww.com/jonmd/Abstract/2005/04000/Gender_Differences_and_Related_Factors_Affecting.8.aspx):

 This study found that subjects who had previously played online games were predominantly male. Gender differences were also found in the severity of online gaming addiction and motives for playing. Older age, lower self-esteem, and lower satisfaction with daily life were associated with more severe addiction among males, but not among females. Special strategies accounting for gender differences must be implemented to prevent adolescents with risk factors from becoming addicted to online gaming.

As noted by APA,

 By listing Internet Gaming Disorder in DSM-5 Section III, APA hopes to encourage research to determine whether the condition should be added to the manual as a disorder.

Hopefully more research will be conducted that includes women to examine gender differences.

<TEXT> You're asking a lot of interesting questions, but I don't think that answering them would be constructive to the overall discussion. One thing to keep in mind is what the [DSM-5](http://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm/dsm-5) is used for. The DSM-5 is: 

 used by clinicians and researchers to diagnose and classify mental disorders. The criteria are concise and explicit, intended to facilitate an objective assessment of symptom presentations in a variety of clinical settingsinpatient, outpatient, partial hospital, consultation-liaison, clinical, private practice, and primary care. 

The criteria are a tool used to facilitate an objective assessment by a mental health professional. Such assessments always involve the consideration of specific, contextual factors unique to the patient in question.

Also keep in mind that these are proposed criteria:

 In the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), Internet Gaming Disorder is identified in Section III as a condition warranting more clinical research and experience before it might be considered for inclusion in the main book as a formal disorder.

Edit: I found this recent [publication](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2014-57712-001/) that tested the reliability and validity of 4 survey instruments to measure IGD on the basis of the 9 criteria from the DSM5. Results:

<TEXT> In this example, the difference is clinical. So, your motivations for gaming - as a seemingly well-adjusted person - would be different from the motivations of someone from a clinical population. As I understand it, your goal is to foster positive feelings, whereas their goal may be emotion regulation. And this isn't even discussing the addiction side of things.

<TEXT> I think IGD is the umbrella term proposed by APA, and includes offline video games as well. Your experiences of using gaming to 'escape' are very common. This is exactly why there is much discussion of whether IGD is caused by gaming itself (and related to impulse control disorder, compulsive gambling), or whether it is an effect of other personality disorders (like you mentioned, using gaming to 'escape'), or some combination of the two (this is most likely). Internet and gaming addiction are newly emergent disorders so research is ongoing. </TEXT>

There are severity modifiers for Internet Gaming Disorder: mild, moderate, or severe. These modifiers are based on how much time is spent playing the games, and how much they impact a persons overall functioning. The diagnostic criteria for Internet Gaming Disorder include:

Repetitive use of Internet-based games, often with other players, that leads to significant issues with functioning. Five of the following criteria must be met within one year:

1. Preoccupation or obsession with Internet games.
2. Withdrawal symptoms when not playing Internet games.
3. A build-up of tolerancemore time needs to be spent playing the games.
4. The person has tried to stop or curb playing Internet games, but has failed to do so.
5. The person has had a loss of interest in other life activities, such as hobbies.
6. A person has had continued overuse of Internet games even with the knowledge of how much they impact a persons life.
7. The person lied to others about his or her Internet game usage.
8. The person uses Internet games to relieve anxiety or guiltits a way to escape.
9. The person has lost or put at risk an opportunity or relationship because of Internet games.

Again, while Internet Gaming Disorder is not an 'official' disorder in the DSM-5, the APA is encouraging further research on the disorder for possible inclusion in future editions of the DSM. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you mean male *and* female? 

What's more, new technologies in DNA sequencing and cell biology are revealing that almost everyone is, to varying degrees, a patchwork of genetically distinct cells, some with a sex that might not match that of the rest of their body. Some studies even suggest that the sex of each cell drives its behaviour, through a complicated network of molecular interactions. I think there's much greater diversity within male or female, and there is certainly an area of overlap where some people can't easily define themselves within the binary structure, says John Achermann, who studies sex development and endocrinology at University College London's Institute of Child Health.

<TEXT> It shouldn't matter since a balanced within-subject design (for donors) was used, and the raters "assessed all collected paired samples from the 184 donors (i. e., 10, 16 and 16 pairs of pads across the first, second and third study, respectively)" (p. 7). 

Also, the authors controlled for this in their [analyses](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/283639383_Consumption_of_garlic_positively_affects_hedonic_perception_of_axillary_body_odour):

As our design was within-subjects, the mean ratings were subsequently compared using repeated-measures ANOVA with the time of day as a between subject factor (entered as a binominal variable). The data were analysed using mean subjects (raters) ratings as the unit of analysis to test possible changes in the perception of axillary odour sampled under different conditions. Each study was then analysed separately. Note that although raters, rather than donors, were used as the unit of analysis, the ratings explicitly incorporated a comparison between pairs of odour samples from the same donors. **Our experimental design and
analytical approach therefore produces results that should be generalizable across donors, while controlling for individual variability of raters olfactory perception** (p. 7). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am not a schizophrenia expert, but as far as I know, yes, [onset](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22380467) for schizophrenia is later in life (i.e., ~25 years for men and ~27 years for women). It looks like schizophrenia presents as a result of a [combination of genetic and environmental factors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19700006), so it is likely both. Neurological differences in schizophrenic brains (vs. non-clinical) have been [found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19700006), but it isn't always clear whether certain differences (e.g., brain volume) preexist prior to onset of symptoms or develop suddenly. Also from the same source:

The diagnosis of schizophrenia is associated with demonstrable alterations in brain structure and changes in dopamine neurotransmission, the latter being directly related to hallucinations and delusions. 

And like you suggested, this results from [this](http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/researchweek/ResearchWeek2015/All2015/291/) research provide evidence for a "double hit model of schizophrenia" (i.e., stress + genetic susceptibility):

In individuals with a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia it may be necessary for a precipitating event to occur, constituting a double hit, for symptoms of schizophrenia to appear.

<TEXT> "The [tongue](http://www.therabreath.com/articles/fresh-breath-happenings/why-cant-we-taste-anything-when-were-sick-34603/) has thousands of taste buds that identify the four primary tastes - salty, sweet, sour and bitter - while the olfactory receptor cells in the nasal cavity measure odors that provide the sumptuous flavors in our food. These cells, when stimulated, send signals to specific areas of the brain, which make us conscious of the perception of taste. In this way, the messages that process taste and smell converge, giving us a more rounded idea of what we consume. ... Meanwhile, odorants, or odor molecules, are identified by the specialized sensory neurons in a small patch of mucus membranes lining the roof of the nose. To get these flavors - whether savory or not so savory - the odorants get stimulated by smells or chemicals in food that initiate a pattern of activity sent to the olfactory bulb. After passing to the primary olfactory cortex at the part of the frontal lobe in the brain, the message is relayed to adjacent parts of the orbital cortex where the combination of odor and taste information helps create the perception of flavor. If mucus in your nasal passages turns too thick, molecules from the air and food can't reach your olfactory receptor cells. Therefore, your brain receives no signal identifying the odor, and everything you eat seems to taste the same. With that being said, you can still feel the texture and temperature of the food, since this information is processed on the tongue."

<TEXT> From the [abstract](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/350/6263/970):

We investigated associations between intestinal helminths and fertility in women, using 9 years of longitudinal data from 986 Bolivian forager-horticulturalists, experiencing natural fertility and 70% helminth prevalence. **We found that different species of helminth are associated with contrasting effects on fecundity**. Infection with roundworm (Ascaris lumbricoides) is associated with earlier first births and shortened interbirth intervals, whereas infection with hookworm is associated with delayed first pregnancy and extended interbirth intervals. Thus, helminths may have important effects on human fertility that reflect physiological and immunological consequences of infection.

<TEXT>  A child is most likely to be abused by a lone mother. 

It is so much more complicated than that. As outlined [here](https://aifs.gov.au/cfca/publications/who-abuses-children), "evidence suggests that a considerable amount of abuse and neglect goes undisclosed, making it difficult to develop an accurate picture of who may abuse or neglect children." 

From the article:

**Physical abuse**

"Research suggests that both mothers and fathers may physically abuse children. Findings from the ABS Personal Safety Survey (2005) indicated that of participants who had experienced physical abuse before the age of 15, 55.6% experienced abuse from their father/stepfather and 25.9% experienced abuse from their mother/stepmother. A further 13.7% experienced abuse from another known person and the remainder were family friends, other relatives, or strangers (ABS, 2005)."

"A British retrospective prevalence study of 2,869 young adults aged 18-24 (May-Chahal   Cawson, 2005) found that mothers were more likely than fathers to be responsible for physical abuse (49% of incidents compared to 40%). However, part of the difference may be explained by the greater time children spend with their mothers than fathers."

**Neglect**

"Evidence also suggests that mothers are more likely than fathers to be held responsible for child neglect. In a large representative study that examined the characteristics of perpetrators in substantiated cases of child abuse and neglect in the United States, neglect was the main type of abuse in 66% of cases involving a female caregiver, compared to 36% of cases involving a male caregiver (US DHHS, 2005). *This finding is consistent with the fact that mothers tend to be the primary caregiver and are usually held accountable for ensuring the safety of children even in two-parent families. In light of societal views on gender roles, it has been argued that this may constitute unreasonable mother blaming* (Allan, 2004; Jackson   Mannix, 2004)."

**Sexual abuse**

"Research focusing on perpetrators of child sexual abuse is extensive compared to other forms of abuse. Evidence overwhelmingly indicates that the majority of child sexual abuse is perpetrated by males (ABS, 2005; McCloskey   Raphael, 2005; Peter, 2009). In a US study examining the characteristics of perpetrators in substantiated cases of child abuse and neglect (US DHHS, 2005), 26% of all cases involving male perpetrators were associated with sexual abuse compared to just 2% of cases involving female perpetrators. Contrary to other types of abuse, research suggests that a far greater number of child sexual abuse offences are perpetrated by adults who are not in a caregiver role (ABS, 2005; US DHHS, 2005). Findings from the ABS Personal Safety Survey (2005) indicated that for participants who had experienced sexual abuse before the age of 15, only 13.5% identified that the abuse came from their father/stepfather, 30.2% was perpetrated by other male relative, 16.9% by family friend, 15.6% by acquaintance/neighbour, and 15.3% by other known person (ABS, 2005)."

**Emotional abuse**

"From the limited research that is available, emotional child abuse mainly comes from parents/caregivers and can come from both mothers and fathers."

**Domestic violence**

"Witnessing domestic violence is now widely recognised as a form of child abuse and neglect in its own right ... Violence between intimate partners with children is overwhelmingly a gendered issue with the vast majority of incidents involving a female victim and male perpetrator (ABS, 2005; Holt et al., 2008; Mulroney, 2003)."

**Fatal child abuse**

"... in a study examining 126 profiles of perpetrators of fatal assault in United States, found that males were three times more likely to fatally assault their children. The study also found that non-biological parents were 17 times more likely to commit a fatal assault toward a child than biological parents (Yampolskaya et al., 2009)."

<TEXT> Well, RCT stands for randomized control trials, and randomization and the inclusion of control group(s) are what make experimental methods experimental by definition. I dont agree with your suggestion that psychology researchers rely on observational data and care less about causality than economists, though (especially in the case of clinical, social, and cognitive programs of research). 

Many psychologists still use college students in their experiments through enrollment (sic) methods that aren't randomized at all."

Do you mean enrolment in university? This doesnt make sense. There are issues with generalizability that arise when using a heterogeneous sample (and psychology researchers will often be the first to acknowledge the limitations of using these samples of convenience), but this has nothing to do with the method - the participants are still randomly assigned. 

And Wikipedia is fine if youre linking to something quickly, like a definition, or a well-known topic. I cant link to a textbook, otherwise I would.

This is dead wrong. Quasi-experiments, aka natural experiments, occur completely outside of the researcher's control (they occur in "nature"). The data is non-experimental i.e. it is solely observational. The researcher has zero control.

I think this depends on your discipline. In psychology, some academics discuss differences between the two  as discussed [here]( http://markholah.com/what-is-the-difference-between-a-quasi-experiment-and-a-natural-experiment-1511.html).

Oh man, investopedia, you sure do know your disciplines.

No need to be snarky. Definitions are definitions, and I believe mine is more comprehensive.

"Those researchers are not psychologists nor are cognitive psychologists behavioral economists (economists care about markets, not individuals). Dan Ariely is not a behavioral economist no matter how much he claims to be one. He's a psychologist."

Wow, okay. Well, it seems like this is more of a personal opinion of yours, and I think I understand why we are butting heads a little bit more having read this last sentence. :P

What if people that eat grilled meat are more likely to smoke? We know that causes cancer, but in the context of this study it looks like the meat does. (I'm just using that as an example, I don't know if the study controlled for that)

Why are you commenting then? At least read the [abstract](http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/75/15_Supplement/836.short):

<TEXT> I don't mean to be rude, but if you can't even finish a well-written thought piece that is discussing the exact thing that you are doing, why are you even posting on here?

It is an article that discusses why the criticism that "XX study just proved the obvious" is problematic. The insufferable "questions" you speak of are examples of unobvious findings that the author is asking you to consider. By your logic, if we all just assumed that the obvious solution was always the truth (and it often is), no one would bother studying anything, and all the counterintuitive findings would never be discovered. It just doesn't make sense, and it isn't how science works. And don't ever forget that hingsight is 20/20 - the author notes: "[In fact, there is good evidence that most of us share a common cognitive bias in the form of the illusion of explanatory depth. This is that we mistake our familiarity with a situation for an understanding of how it works](https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-20/edition-2/isnt-it-all-just-obvious)."

The goal is to not to confuse something making intuitive sense to you with actually understanding it. There is a big difference. I really hope you read it. Even the last two sections.

<TEXT> I still do that as an adult :P

That's making a choice for the present vs. more distant future, though. Eating 2 bags of chips in one sitting likely has more to do with self-regulation rather than episodic foresight. The choice to continue the present bahviour (eating tasty chips) rather than regulate themselves to ensure their future self won't feel ill still suggests a focus on the present.

To link chip eating to this study, it's the same procedure as with the pretzels. You'd have to give the kids those 2 bags of chips to eat until their mouths hurt and they felt ill (not super ethical ;), then ask them if they would like chips (vs. water) tomorrow at the next session. It all has to do with how present states influence decisions about future preferences. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is a well-designed and executed study and a rather clever test of the hypothesis. Methodologically sloppy it is not (it simply wouldn't have been published if it were). With your videogame/ savings goals example, that seems to be more in the realm of self-regulation/ delay of gratification, which is a bit different. You are right though, young kids are able to delay gratification, like you did with your savings goal; ["4-year-olds typically choose the larger, delayed reward, exhibiting delay of gratification, whereas 3-year-olds typically choose the small, immediate reward"](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dev.21249/abstract). Studies on episodic foresight have more to do with current states influencing predictions about the future. I guess my question would then be... what are some alternative explanations for the results (i.e., kids overwhelmingly preferred pretzels to water at baseline, yet when thirsty, anticipated that their future selves would prefer the opposite. Even more, they switched back to thinking their future self would prefer pretzels after having a drink of water in the present, and were not at all aware that their "thirsty" state was what was driving their choices)? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is decision making, though, for a kid. The kids overwhelmingly preferred pretzels to water at baseline, yet preferred the opposite when thirsty. Even more, they switched back to preferring pretzels after having a drink of water, and were not at all aware that their "thirsty" state was what was driving their choices. This tells us that they are lacking in episodic foresight... that is, they can't discount their current state when making decisions about the future. They really can't think "hmm, I really enjoyed these pretzels today. Even though I had my fill and am thirsty now, I will surely enjoy them just as much tomorrow". This is actually a really clever design and a good test of the hypothesis. A bunch of [research](http://eden.rutgers.edu/~jprabhak/HudsonMayhewPrabhakar2011.pdf) has been done showing similar results using a variety of methodologies (some better than others). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really like how you phrased this... it reminds me a bit of Mark Twain's The Mysterious Stranger:

"For as much as a year Satan continued these visits, but at last he came less often, and then for a long time he did not come at all. This always made me lonely and melancholy. I felt that he was losing interest in our tiny world and might at any time abandon his visits entirely. When one day he finally came to me I was overjoyed, but only for a little while. He had come to say good-by, he told me, and for the last time. He had investigations and undertakings in other corners of the universe, he said, that would keep him busy for a longer period than I could wait for his return.

"And you are going away, and will not come back any more?"

"Yes," he said. "We have comraded long together, and it has been pleasant - pleasant for both; but I must go now, and we shall not see each other any more."

"In this life, Satan, but in another? We shall meet in another, surely?"

Then, all tranquilly and soberly, he made the strange answer, "There is no other."

A subtle influence blew upon my spirit from his, bringing with it a vague, dim, but blessed and hopeful feeling that the incredible words might be true - even must be true.

"Have you never suspected this, Theodor?"

"No. How could I? But if it can only be true -"

"It is true."

A gust of thankfulness rose in my breast, but a doubt checked it before it could issue in words, and I said, "But - but - we have seen that future life - seen it in its actuality, and so -"

"It was a vision - it had no existence."

I could hardly breathe for the great hope that was struggling in me. "A vision? - a vi -"

"Life itself is only a vision, a dream."

It was electrical. By God! I had had that very thought a thousand times in my musings!

"Nothing exists; all is a dream. God - man - the world - the sun, the moon, the wilderness of stars - a dream, all a dream; they have no existence. Nothing exists save empty space - and you!"

"I!"

"And you are not you - you have no body, no blood, no bones, you are but a thought. I myself have no existence; I am but a dream - your dream, creature of your imagination. In a moment you will have realized this, then you will banish me from your visions and I shall dissolve into the nothingness out of which you made me . . .

"I am perishing already - I am failing - I am passing away. In a little while you will be alone in shoreless space, to wander its limitless solitudes without friend or comrade forever - for you will remain a thought, the only existent thought, and by your nature inextinguishable, indestructible. But I, your poor servant, have revealed you to yourself and set you free. Dream other dreams, and better!

"Strange! that you should not have suspected years ago - centuries, ages, eons, ago! - for you have existed, companionless, through all the eternities.

Strange, indeed, that you should not have suspected that your universe and its contents were only dreams, visions, fiction! Strange, because they are so frankly and hysterically insane - like all dreams: a God who could make good children as easily as bad, yet preferred to make bad ones; who could have made every one of them happy, yet never made a single happy one; who made them prize their bitter life, yet stingily cut it short; who gave his angels eternal happiness unearned, yet required his other children to earn it; who gave his angels painless lives, yet cursed his other children with biting miseries and maladies of mind and body; who mouths justice and invented hell - mouths mercy and invented hell - mouths Golden Rules, and forgiveness multiplied by seventy times seven, and invented hell; who mouths morals to other people and has none himself; who frowns upon crimes, yet commits them all; who created man without invitation, then tries to shuffle the responsibility for man's acts upon man, instead of honorably placing it where it belongs, upon himself; and finally, with altogether divine obtuseness, invites this poor, abused slave to worship him! . . .

"You perceive, now, that these things are all impossible except in a dream. You perceive that they are pure and puerile insanities, the silly creations of an imagination that is not conscious of its freaks - in a word, that they are a dream, and you the maker of it. The dream-marks are all present; you should have recognized them earlier.

"It is true, that which I have revealed to you; there is no God, no universe, no human race, no earthly life, no heaven, no hell. It is all a dream - a grotesque and foolish dream. Nothing exists but you. And you are but a thought - a vagrant thought, a useless thought, a homeless thought, wandering forlorn among the empty eternities!"

He vanished, and left me appalled; for I knew, and realized, that all he had said was true.

I think it is important to share since many of the comments on the original TIL post were "well, I guess I'm fucked".

<TEXT> Yes... when all the data is averaged across a population, the trend is that night owls exhibit more of these traits (i.e., #s 2-4 in your list) than morning larks. You would be considered an outlier in that sense. But we cannot all be outliers... from a statistical standpoint, this is simply impossible :P... I see your point, though, which is - I think - that we are all complex and multi-faceted, and might not always fit neatly into categories. But this isn't synonymous with being an outlier. These types of statistical analyses take into account all of these individual nuances. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had pretty severe bacne when I was your age - considering the age, it is likely hormonal. I was prescribed 75mg/ day of Spironolactone by my dermatologist. I also began using a mild laundry detergent and wearing a new, clean T-shirt to bed every night (no exceptions). I also applied 5% benzoyl peroxide lotion (from drug store) every night before bed (tip: get white sleeping t-shirts as the peroxide can bleach fabric over time). In the mornings I washed the area with Spectro gel as my last shower step (to wash away any shampoo/ conditioner) and applied some benzoyl peroxide lotion. My back is completely clear now. Honestly, I think the back acne was mostly hormonal and the Spironolactone did most of the work. You/ your parents should book an appointment to see a dermatologist regardless. Best of luck :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> After buying a Japanese copy of Pokemon White, and trying (and failing) to breed a shiny Vulpix, I wanted to move on and MM for my favourite Pokemon, Pikachu. I caught a modest Japanese Ditto, traded it to my White game, and bred it - holding an Everstone - with my Raichu brought up from Diamond. After ~30 eggs, this little one hatched. It has a modest nature, and although it only has "decent" stats all around, it has "fantastic" potential for speed. I just finished EV training it in Special Attack and Speed, and let it evolve into a Pikachu (http://i.imgur.com/IkRvaGJ.jpg). Couldn't be happier! :oD </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know... I think that it has a great deal of significance to the movement. Every social media post/comment about those stories is: "Those damn meddling feminazis are making a fuss again!". The stories are about women and women's issues... ergo.... feminist. I personally hate how feminism has become such a bad thing with the worst connotations when it is so inherently good. The concept of feminism, the theory, all the history and evolution of the movement... all the different facets... is so misunderstood and lost on the average Jill and Joe. And that isn't entirely their fault. Without going to college or university, where do people learn about feminism (this is an actual question)? Should feminists do a better job of explaining feminism to the masses? Like Emma Watson did? Feminism shouldn't be so threatening to people... but it is. People have this knee-jerk reaction to it. Despite this connotation, I will never stop calling myself a feminist. I don't know where to go from here. Honestly. :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> For what it's worth, I was one of these overly attached children and turned out okay. But, the behaviour stems from insecurity. You should Google "attachment styles" - the child is exhibiting classic insecure attachment patterns and you should figure out where it is coming from. The best thing you and your girlfriend can do is provide a stable, nurturing environment for the child with a lot of routine. It is equally important for the parents to be regarded by the child as secure and stable themselves. This means no drama, excessive drinking/ drug use/ partying/ etc. Parents need to be parents. The child needs to learn that when they go to the sitter, it is only for a little while, and mom will be there at the end of the day. Be specific, firm - but loving - and make it a routine. The child will eventually get the hang of it. </TEXT>
