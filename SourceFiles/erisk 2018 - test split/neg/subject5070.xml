<TITLE> Greenlandic and Related Languages </TITLE>

<TEXT> **I already postet the exact same thing on r/greenlandic but maybe its helpful for some of you.**

It's not easy to distinguish the dialects of Kalaallisut/Inuvialuktun/Inuktitut/Inupiaq but I'll give my best, maybe this will help to get a better overview of the Inuit languages.

* **Greenlandic:**

**Kalaallisut** is the standart dialect of the greenlandic language and has it's origin in the western part of Greenland, it's virtually identical to the standart greenlandic. (50.000 native speakers)

**Tunumiisut** is spoken in east Greenland, some people see it as a distinct language but it's generally considered a divergent dialect of Greenlandic. (3000 native speakers)

**Inuktun** is spoken in the northernmost part of greenland (surroundings of Qaanaaq) and is a dialect of the Canadian Inuktitut and Kalaallisut. (800 native speakers)

* **Canadian Inuit languages:**
Unlike the languages spoken in Greenland most of the Canadian Inuit languages have in addition to the looped cursive Cree syllabics.

**Inuktitut** is by far the biggest language of the canadian Inuit languages, it has many dialects such as: Inuttitut, Inuktun, Qikiqtaaluk niginiani, Qikiqtaaluk uannanqani... (34.000 native speakers)

**Inuvialuktun** is sometimes considered as a dialect of Inuktitut and has several (sub)dialects such as: Siglutun, Inuinnaqtun, Natsilingmuitut, Kivallirmiutut... (2000 native speakers)

* **Alaskan Inuit languages:**

**Inupiaq** is distinguished in north Alaskan Inupiaq (Qawiaraq) and northwestern Inupiaq. (9000 native speakers) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Lifelong Emetophobia </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-17 00:03:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have had emetophobia since I can remember. But until today I never thought that this is actually something that has a name... Well now here I am writing to get myself calm. Some questions:

Whom of you knows why you have this irrational fear? I believe I have it thanks to a poisoning I had as little child and I guess seeing how my parents freaked out that I might die because a raw mushroom got me sick was the root cause. 

Whom of you got over it? Completely? I think I made progress myself. I for example dont care if someone next to me vomits as long as I know that its not contagious (eg Alcohol). Years back Id freak out If I even heard the sound or whatever, but even though thats a succes I feel like this phobia is going to follow me into my grave.

Currently I have little panic attacks at least once a week. And thats always when I try to sleep, always. 

I think that my stomach is actually very sensible which contributes to my emetophobia a lot. I have pyrosis way to often recently for example. 

Anyways I think that this sub is something I will keep an eye on. Because in real life I am very lonely with this fear. Trying to sleep now but I would be very happy if I get some responses. :)

<TITLE> Macbook Pro for 3D modelling / Applemouse charging </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-08 13:41:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I always wanted to get a MacBook Pro but I mainly use - other than office - Blender for 3D modelling and CAD+T for work. And I wonder how these programs would perform on a Macbook Pro? I always hear that the Apple software for video editing runs superb on MBP  but what about the programs I mentioned?

Another quick question: How is the Applemouse charged? Lightning or USB-C? Lightning would seem counterintuitive. 

TIA </TEXT>

**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?**

* No overclockig

**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

* 1TB HDD would actually be sufficient. If the budget allows it he would appreciate an SSD.

**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

<TEXT> I never had Carnivorous Plants before. How do I keep them Alive. How much light do they need? Can I just use Rainwater for Irrigation? How ofter do they need to be Irrigated? Should I replant these two soon?

The Sundew should be slightly red, is that true? I think that especially the Sundew is not in the best condition.

I live in Austria. Right now its raining frequently and has about 10  Celsius ( 50  Fahrenheit) Should I put them outside? The humidity in my House is i guess not good for these plants.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I live in Austria and I wanted to buy the 1070 but no matter where I buy it, the gtx will always cost me 500 which is about 550$. This seems unreasonably priced to me. I think gpu's are in generall more expensive in Austria compared to the us, but which graphics card will give me as much power as the 1070 for a cheaper price? </TEXT>

<TEXT> As an Austrian I would say that the time right before WWI has been a somewhat golden age for our country. During that time Vienna was next to Paris the center for Artists. People like Sigmund Freud, Alfred Adler, Stefan Zweig, Lenin, Hitler and (IIRC) Trotzki were living in Vienna around 1913. 

Edit: I just added Hitler to the list since it is interesting to know IMO. I dont think that he contributed very much for the Austrian Golden Age... </TEXT>

<TITLE> Upgrading my old Pc and getting a new monitor. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-21 20:15:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My current three year old Rig is:


Intel Core i7-4820K CPU @ 3.70GHz

GeForce GTX 660 Ti

X79A-GD45 Plus (MS-7760)

8 GB Ram

265 Gb SSD

1TB HDD

Sharkoon BD28


And I am going to replace my 660 with a 1080. Here comes the main question. Am I able to play on a 4k monitor games on highest settings? Or should I just get a 2560x1440 monitor? I have to confess that I dont really understand 4k... does playing on a 4k monitor mean that every game is going to be more demanding? Or could I just switch the resolution in the settings to something lower than 4k and play every game "normal"? What are the downsides of 4k monitors? Well these are the queestions. And last but not least I would be glad if someone could recommend me an awesome monitor - now that you know my rig- at a budget of 500 (570 $). 

TIA </TEXT>

8 GB Ram

Tower: Sharkoon BD28

Cooling: Corsair RM 650

My plan is to change my GPU with either a 1070 or 1080 and to overclock my CPU. As some of you recommended to me, but I need some further help since I don't now much about building a pc:

Why is the prize range on the 1080 so high, what is the big difference between a 1080 from EVGA and a 1080 from zotac (for example) ? What is the founders edition? Should I stay away from it? Which version of the 1080/1070 would fit best for my specs? Is it a good idea to purchase graphics cards from amazon?

Which grafics card would be the highest I could build into my pc? Will it overheat if I build a 1080 in? Or is a 1080 useless with my current CPU? Should I wait for the new Amd Flagship instead?

<TEXT> I wrote this for the greenlandic subreddit some time ago and I think it might be helpful in this regard:

It's not easy to distinguish the dialects of Kalaallisut/Inuvialuktun/Inuktitut/Inupiaq but I'll give my best, maybe this will help to get a better overview of the Inuit languages.
Greenlandic:


Kalaallisut is the standart dialect of the greenlandic language and has it's origin in the western part of Greenland, it's virtually identical to the standart greenlandic. (50.000 native speakers)


Tunumiisut is spoken in east Greenland, some people see it as a distinct language but it's generally considered a divergent dialect of Greenlandic. (3000 native speakers)


Inuktun is spoken in the northernmost part of greenland (surroundings of Qaanaaq) and is a dialect of the Canadian Inuktitut and Kalaallisut. (800 native speakers)


Canadian Inuit languages: Unlike the languages spoken in Greenland most of the Canadian Inuit languages have in addition to the looped cursive Cree syllabics.


Inuktitut is by far the biggest language of the canadian Inuit languages, it has many dialects such as: Inuttitut, Inuktun, Qikiqtaaluk niginiani, Qikiqtaaluk uannanqani... (34.000 native speakers)


Inuvialuktun is sometimes considered as a dialect of Inuktitut and has several (sub)dialects such as: Siglutun, Inuinnaqtun, Natsilingmuitut, Kivallirmiutut... (2000 native speakers)


Alaskan Inuit languages:


Inupiaq is distinguished in north Alaskan Inupiaq (Qawiaraq) and northwestern Inupiaq. (9000 native speakers)

<TITLE> Do you think Tripwire will manage to get new players on full release? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-31 15:59:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am just asking this because I've never witnessed a game going from early acces to full release and how it affected the average number of people playing. (Games like DayZ will never get out of ea I think...) 
You can see the player numbers for kf2 [here](http://steamcharts.com/app/232090) it's somewhat stable - isn't it? So if anyone knows a game that got succesfully out of ea please tell me it's name.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Greenlandic and related languages. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-25 15:41:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's not easy to distinguish the dialects of Kalaallisut/Inuvialuktun/Inuktitut/Inupiaq but I'll give my best, maybe this will help to get a better overview of the Inuit languages.

* **Greenlandic:**

**Kalaallisut** is the standart dialect of the greenlandic language and has it's origin in the western part of Greenland, it's virtually identical to the standart greenlandic. (50.000 native speakers)

**Tunumiisut** is spoken in east Greenland, some people see it as a distinct language but it's generally considered a divergent dialect of Greenlandic. (3000 native speakers)

**Inuktun** is spoken in the northernmost part of greenland (surroundings of Qaanaaq) and is a dialect of the Canadian Inuktitut and Kalaallisut. (800 native speakers)

* **Canadian Inuit languages:**
Unlike the languages spoken in Greenland most of the Canadian Inuit languages have in addition to the looped cursive Cree syllabics.

**Inuktitut** is by far the biggest language of the canadian Inuit languages, it has many dialects such as: Inuttitut, Inuktun, Qikiqtaaluk niginiani, Qikiqtaaluk uannanqani... (34.000 native speakers)

**Inuvialuktun** is sometimes considered as a dialect of Inuktitut and has several (sub)dialects such as: Siglutun, Inuinnaqtun, Natsilingmuitut, Kivallirmiutut... (2000 native speakers)

* **Alaskan Inuit languages:**

**Inupiaq** is distinguished in north Alaskan Inupiaq (Qawiaraq) and northwestern Inupiaq. (9000 native speakers)

<TEXT> Have you seen what's going on at [r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/) right now? Many people are uploading images showing the distribution of a certain country like [this](http://i.imgur.com/dA92oJp.png), which is very interesting to see IMO. So I tried to find such a heatmap for Greenland as well. But neither [nunagis.gl](http://en.nunagis.gl/) nor [Greenland Statistics](http://www.stat.gl/default.asp?lang=en) has such a map. Does anyone know where to find something like this and 
if not does someone know a program for making such heatmaps?

<TEXT> I know what you mean, and I read everything you wrote, the main question of this post was just about the dictionray which got answered very fast. And I just thought that I could use this opportunity to ask something else as well. It is true that I'm not very prepared, but as I said, this question was just a "Bonus" as I can't do my trip to GL very soon. And I'm not quite sure what you meant with fantasy get off Sub, do you think I try to be a Special Sowflake because of loving Greenland? And I can understand that you don't like the word Settlement, but as a not native Speaker the only other possibility I can think of is village or town and I decided to use mainly the word settlement since thats how every inhabited place in Greenland is called in Wikipedia, tell me how I should call it and why (would be much appreciated). </TEXT>

<TITLE> Kalaallisut dictionary and travelling to Greenland. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-06 20:40:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So as you might have noticed I am currently the only one posting on this subreddit, so I try to combine questions.

First question: Is there anywhere in the Internet a useful KL dictionary? I know [this one](https://de.glosbe.com/kl/de/) but it isn't very big.

Second Question: I am planning on travelling to Greenland and I would be happy to get some tips of ppl, who have already done that. Did you fly or go by ship? Which Settlements did you visit? Do you have to go with a group if you want to go hiking? Did you visit the national park? How expensive was it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me it doesn't matter what science says and proves and I am as open minded as you can get, but in the end I always come to God if I am anxious, I can't do anything about it wheter doubt it or not, I just fall into "Gods hands" when I'm in need. 

And is this what Kierkegaard said about religion? If anyone is familiar with his beliefs and could recommend me a book to understand him, I would be very happy.  </TEXT>
