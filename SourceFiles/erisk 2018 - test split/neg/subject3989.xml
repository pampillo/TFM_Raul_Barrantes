<TEXT> What this guy says, I would recommend going to the uni library or even a public one in your area to do whatever work you need to do if you can't get rid of all the distractions at home. 

In terms of getting yourself organised, I can send you a weekly planner I used to map out how much free time throughout the week I had which helps put things into perspective how much time in a day you actually have (I was pretty shit at time management but still managed above avg grades working 25hrs a week with a full-time study load). 

Just start getting organised - use a calendar to map out all your exams, assignments etc. Once you have it all broken down and know what you need to do to make it through it makes it so much easier. Goodluck man you can do this. PM me if you ever need anything </TEXT>

<TEXT> So far i've collected around 15 keys (I didn't screenshot everything but you can see my bank is starting to get cluttered) but It's late, work tomorrow signing off for the night.

Some tips:


- Collect rune talismans for the areas you're roaming (self explanatory why)

- Some of the best loots I've gotten is from searching upstairs where people are trying to hide and wait until their skull is gone, always check around there

- ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE INVENTORY ROOM. I've lost 5+ bank keys because they don't drop on the floor, i've lost atleast 5 keys from being stupid

Can't really think of anything else too important. Have fun boys :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess i'm sort of the stingy one here, I don't do it intentionally but I have always been really tight with my money and how I spend it. So when I'm out with my work friends I always get the bare minimum of water and the cheapest meal while they feast like kings. 

Now back to them spending too much, they almost never finish their meals so by the end of the meal I always end up taking the free drink there, a plate of chips here and an untouched dessert over in the corner. I could honestly not pay anything at all and be full but I won't stoop that low </TEXT>

Is he late to his WoW guild meeting? Is his pet turtle late to his vet appointment? 

No, most of the time they're just assholes. But I always give them a smile and wave if i have the chance just to fuck with them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think i'm in the 1% for this but I always try to avoid crowds the best I can. When I used to catch busses I would always either have to be at the very front of the line if not I would just wait and get on last to avoid the line. Same with any other sort of crowd i'd rather wait an extra 5 minutes to avoid being in the middle and walk freely, it doesn't have anything to do with anxiety just a personal preference I guess. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd say either your laptop can't play high bit-rate (quality) videos or it may have something to do with your SD card. Although VLC is known to play anything you throw at it, maybe try using windows media player. If you can record the clips in 720p and watch it fine then it's probably your laptop that can't handle playing it.
Also just check that the write speed on your SD card is fast enough to support the high quality recording (Samsung cards are usually fine especially if it's the one mentioned on the website)
Goodluck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> haha thanks :D it's better because you still get a 10 car garage, it's only like 270k or something which is cheaper than the 400k and theres not griefers always waiting outside your place to blow shit up etc.

<TITLE> Your favourite/best money making methods? </TITLE>

<TEXT> I know a lot of you guys won't want to give away your shooper shecret methods but I was just wondering what/how others people make their money or if they have any tips they want to share.
For me, the best I've found is doing the briefcase missions for martin, then storing the car that the guy is driving to sell to the Los Santos Customs after finishing/failing the mission. The only other decent way I've found is repeating 'Down the drain' races over and over, if you have 4+ people playing with you, if you win you can get up to 13.6k and even if you lose your still getting some decent money.

/thoughts? </TEXT>
