<TEXT> In high school, I would lower my head to tackle.  Boy did I annihilate anyone in my path and wreck my poor brain.  After a while, I realized I would end up paralyzed so I quit and just played baseball.  The only reason why I could hit with reckless abandon was the false sense of security that helmet and pads gave me.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have watched some playthroughs of "little nightmares," and it looked great! Spooky and great art style. I'd say it be more puzzle based but not too difficult.  After playing with her for a while I feel like she could get the hang of it. Again I haven't played the game myself but it is worth checking out on youtube at least! </TEXT>
