<TEXT> Try the reverse sear.  I like to take my meat out and put it on a plate/platter and salt and pepper both sides, cover with saran wrap and let sit on the counter for at least a couple hours.  This allows the salt to extract water, become a solution and re-absorb into the meat through osmosis.  Gives a nice salty flavor.  Then I go into the oven for a bit till it's gray, and then final sear in the pan.  You should look into a pan sauce.  I'm not very good at those though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I put Montreal steak seasoning on some beef ribs (they almost look like spare ribs they're not very long the way they were cut) and loaded them in a dutch oven on top of 1/8th sections of onions.  Put them in the oven @ 275 freedom degrees with aluminum foil helping to seal the lid.  Going to let it go for about 3 hours and then finish with Sweet Baby Rays' bbq sauce.  Does that sound good?  Any suggestions (especially on finishing, no grill available)? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, if doing thin burgers the grillmometer should be at least 350F.  Usually more like 450F.  For really thick burgers, you should have two zones, one hot and a safe zone so they don't get really burnt up on the outside. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it depends on how thick they are.  If they are thin, you can do them on high.  However, if they're frozen that would be bad on the grill.  If you are doing them big and thick, you're going to want to slow the process to get the inside cooked to an acceptable temp.  You should probably employ a thermometer.

edit: my father would flip the burger when the red juice from the inside came to the top for a regular sized (1/4lb) burger.  Thermometer suggestion is only for thick burgers, so you can tell where the inside is at.  Toppings:  Do you have a can of New Mexico green chile?  Pepper jack cheese?  Pickles?  Tomato? Saute'd mushroom? </TEXT>

The new MAF was from Amazon and genuine Delco.  Seriously, before that I thought the trans was going out again and it wouldn't hold 30 mph on the way up a mountain pass where the speed limit was 55. </TEXT>

It's amazing such a large machine can fit in a boggan afterwards, everything that wasn't metal or Kevlar (in the track) is gone. Right here they are looking at how the starter motor gear is still engaged to the drive clutch which probably cause the starter to catch fire. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Op could go to therapist and point out fear of driving. Therapist could recommend getting a bigger car. Op buys said bigger car and does feel better. Op has shown emotional distress that she was treated for with big car. Judge awards emotional treble damages: cost of therapy, all car costs (loss of value in old car + difference in price for new car), and pain and suffering.

No, he got fired or not. But it doesn't sound like Federal DOT became involved. But if they did become involved it would have been way worse for the driver of the truck. So, the whole part of whether the person responsible in this instance is whether the "damage" whether political or in reality is rising to the level of notice for the Federal DOT. </TEXT>

I didn't hear the horn blaring because I was in a diesel vehicle and didn't realize that I'd hit her or that I was even involved in an accident and that's why I didn't stop. I'd been having break issues and thought it was just my brakes acting up."

<TEXT> Yeah, I think somewhere in the 30-40 lb range for potatoes and corn. I'm thinking they should be equal. Probably better to have too much than not enough, there won't be anyone sober enough to go get more, and the cook can always not add it all.  Regarding sausage, you want a lot. Maybe 60 lbs? The trick is to have enough spice for all of that, but I guess someone else is responsible for that part. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I ate at a place that served crap Mexican on the UNM campus in ABQ the other day. That place has 5 stars on google and has expanded to take over the whole block. Parking is insane. Man, it was really good though. My regular Mexican place offers the rellenos 3 ways, and I they have really good salsa. I like to make stuff at home also, like a pork green chile stew. That's pretty awesome. I guess that Mexico has lots of styles because it's fairly large and you've got to find the ones you like, or find something you like that is in the style of the restaurant that you feel comfortable with. There's a new restaurant near me that is completely different from the others. I won't say it's better/worse, just different style. Also, I think Mexico City is doing a lot of new things which cost a lot and are taking Mexican food to new territory. </TEXT>

In New Mexico, there is a stuffed sopapilla which is a dinner entree stuffed with beans, meat, veg, etc. and probably sauced and cheesed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Typically at a steak house or other restaurant or your kitchen at home a steak used to be seared in a pan, and then finished in the oven for even cooking and no excessive burning on the outside.  
The reverse sear works better because it creates more rare or medium-rare beef.  Start in an oven to say rare (112-118f) and then finish with a fast sear in the pan on the stovetop to temp. </TEXT>

 With sardines, if you smush the fish up like tuna fish, you wouldn't really notice the innards and spine. They're soft and they mix right in.

I like the pickled herring.  In my store there's some (jarred in the fish section) with wine sauce and onion or sour cream and onion.  It would be great on bread, but I do Trisquit.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oops, I thought the problem was the sauce was too sweet. If it's the pork and the sauce, why you're going to the wrong place. You can just not touch the pork and put it in a slow cooker for 8 hours and it will come out tender and flavorful all by itself to make shredded pork.  Wherever you're getting pulled pork is trying to short-cut it because they don't want to cook it that long. There's a place like that near me, and I don't frequent it. They say they don't serve pulled pork, it's sliced. F that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let me tell you a story about a little ski resort in Colorado.  We have about 12 tracked vehicles that run 16 hours per night in the winter season. So, the tracks are rubber belting, grousers (cleats), backing plates, bolts and wheel guides.  I am pretty sure that we had a problem with something in the grousers and we're changing 4 broken grousers/machine/night for two seasons. Wow, what a problem, hopefully it's all fixed this season. We thought it might be operator error/abuse, but no it's bad aluminum, bad bolts, or something else IMHO. btw, rubber belting gets replaced every other year.  And that has worked for many years as regular maintenance. </TEXT>

Sometimes you just order a crankshaft and a couple cylinders, pistons, full gasket set, etc.  The cylinders are nikasil, so we can't fuck with those.  There's a rebuild program though for cranks and cylinders so you have to send back the bad ones. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One thing you could try is to get it thinner first.  And then apply the plastic spatula once it's in the pan.  A good way to do this is to take the sausage and lay it on a fairly big piece of saran wrap.  Then place an equally big piece of saran wrap over the top.  Use your rolling pin to roll it out into one big flat piece.  If it's too big for the pan, use two pans or do two batches and then combine into one after browning.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So we've had this loader for quite a while and for the last three years the fuel gauge hasn't worked properly. The story I got was that when it was full, fine, then as you ran the machine the gauge would stop going down and hold on 3/4th full. Well, we try to replace the fuel tank sender. Ordered the wrong part, sent back and try again (big job). Replace sender, nope doesn't work. Trace the wiring, determine it's the engine ECU. How about we replace the instrument cluster for the third time in three years? Nope, doesn't fix it. Order the engine ECU, receive the wrong one because engine S/N. Tape on the box says you can't return it. Order the correct ECU and finally that thing is fixed. Most expensive fuel gauge EVER! ($10,000 est.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> On a bus, there's a 5x5" plastic plate with grooves in it to form an x pattern from corner to corner. The legend says that to open door, smash plate and turn handle in emergency. About ten years ago the cost of the plastic plate went from $5 to $130. There had to be a lawsuit. To be fair, if you weren't careful pulling your hand back out of that in an emergency it would probably tear you up pretty good from the four points in the center. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It looks like you're using "country-style" ribs. It's a really tough cut of porcine goodness. I don't think there's any way to get that tender on a grill, low and slow in the oven maybe, but a grill is going to be difficult. So anyway, it's NOT YOUR FAULT! Edit: this cut contains multiple muscles some of which you can get to tender and tasty, and the loin portion is always a big fail for me that needs buckets of gravy or bbq sauce. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Try the mexican section of your store. In a cast iron dutch oven saute some diced onion, fresh seeded jalapeno (and/or serranno/pueblo) peppers, when onion is browning add minced/lean ground beef/turkey/chicken, add cayenne powder, cumin, s p, dried oregano, garlic powder to taste. Lower heat, add water/broth for a thickish mixture. Add refried beans (from a can). Add more water/broth as necessary, and simmer low for an hour stirring often. Don't let stuff burn on the bottom! Boom, big batch of Mexican burrito/taco filling. Package and freeze for up to 2 weeks in portion sizes. You can use this to fill an omelette, a taco, a burrito, a salad, add diced onion, rice, cheese, hot/or not sauces as needed. I left tomato out of the main and toppings deliberately as you don't like them, but they should be part of both. </TEXT>

When I got there, I realized what paying for an education meant and did real well. I could recommend that HS students go to community college for at least two maybe four semesters and then transfer to the big one. Work hard and do good. Also, if you have any math classes don't miss a day and do your homework every night. If you don't it will be a problem because every new lesson is based on what you learned the lesson b4. You will fall behind badly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Steak is kind of expensive and you might need a few tests to get it right. You could do the chicken with fancy potatoes. Get some of those baby red and yellow/yukon ones, slice to bite sized, toss w/olive oil, salt and pepper, herbs (parsley, thyme or rosemary), add a head of garlic cloves, skin removed, halved, and roast on a sheet pan in the oven turning halfway. Maybe 375f for 25 minutes.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> What does seem certain is that the word "brunch"that playful blend of "breakfast" and "lunch" first appeared in print in an 1895 Hunter's Weekly article. In "Brunch: A Plea," British author Guy Beringer suggested an alternative to the heavy, post-church Sunday meals in favor of lighter fare served late in the morning. ''Brunch is cheerful, sociable and inciting,'' Beringer says. ''It is talk-compelling. It puts you in a good temper, it makes you satisfied with yourself and your fellow beings, it sweeps away the worries and cobwebs of the week.'' Credit Smithsonianmag.com for the reference to Hunter's Weekly. Alton Brown used this explanation also on his show good eats, to which I couldn't find a link. </TEXT>

I will say that the Ford dealer that I deal with is awesome. They always give me the part number, my cost, and if there's any question they will fax the part breakdown. I wish they had a website, but I understand it's really hard. I really like the Caterpillar website for parts, but sometimes it's impossible and I have to call the dealer. And then they are having trouble, but we figure it out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, sometimes I can get a Ford re-man instrument cluster for a pickup. They require me to state the vin and mileage and return the old one due to US mileage faking laws. On certain Fords, if you need to buy the ignition switch you have to change the door locks also in order to keep it to one key. Or visa-versa. I wonder why they limited the odometer to 300,000 though. There are 9s in there somewhere. I've heard of similar stuff in computers, but usually those numbers are divisible by 8 or 24 or something logical. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That really reminds me of my first table when I was a waiter at a semi-fancy restaurant. Somehow it happened to be prom night, and my first table ever was an 6 top. I had actually had a bit of training, here's the computer, here's how you enter stuff to get a bill, here's the salads, here's the dressings, here's the desserts you're going to serve, here's the tall pepper grinders that you can offer during the salad, here's the fountain for drink re-fills, napkins, I don't know there was a lot of stuff. Like after your shift you have to make sure to do the carpet, and dust this and that. Important things like this is where the food comes from and this is where you turn your order in. Anyway, my first table I go out and bring the menus, receive and deliver the drinks, and then take the order. Well this is where IFU. I guess I was excited and I totally their appetizers. I must have run to the line and turned in their dinner orders and started hustling their drinks and salads and totally forgot the apps and all of that delay. I think I might have realized that when I presented the bill and apologized or mentioned that I didn't charge them and it all worked out. I think I worked there for a number of more months. oops, sorry prom dinner party. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Very interesting wheel bearing. I've never heard of one that uses ball bearings like the commenter on imgur states. Also, the race is smaller than the bearing which I guess is the way ball bearings work. I had to google the name, maybe Chevy should come out with those again instead of the Caprice. I really wanted to blame Fiat-Chrysler for this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've used lkq a few times with success. Twice specifically for a Ford 8.8 rear end on two '98 f150s. I guess my local shop couldn't repair it if the bearings spun in the housing. IDK, they tell me stuff's fubar get another, but in this case we did try to send it for repair. IMO those rear ends suck, we have a pretty good maintenance program and our f150s aren't high mileage or off road use.

<TEXT> So, I've had my Blazer since 2003 or so and replaced the LF door hinge pins and bushings once back about 6-7 years ago.  The hinges were badly wallered out, and of course the new bushings didn't hold up.  Now it's time to either do the same again or I noticed that Dorman has come out with replacement hinges for just this application.  #924-106 and 924-107.  http://www.dormanproducts.com/gsearch.aspx?type=parttype year=2000 make=Chevrolet model=Blazer parttype=Door%2520Hinge%2520Assembly origin=YMM

Wondering if anyone has experience with this whole hinge repair.  The problem is the current hinges are spot welded into place, and it may be required to remove the whole dash or something to get at the back side of the upper hinge to install the new hinge and backing plate.  Wat do? </TEXT>

One has two rings of raw onion, the other three.  Then we get to the bun.  I looks good, and if you made it yourself, congrats.  No one would buy it though.  Maybe next time try some egg wash or butter and sesame seeds for a more even finished look.  The only other things about it is the patties are too small and they look like Jimmy Dean sausage. </TEXT>

So, they weigh the investor, calculate the number of bungies, go to Utah, put him in a rig, jump off a bridge, and the bungies break. They have a boat below of course, but there happens to be another boat closer that goes into rescue mode. They get close and call out "wholly cow are you OK".

<TEXT> One of the guys at work.  His wifey is buying a Subaru Crosstrek.  She insists on a manual trans.  There are three coming into the state in 3 weeks.  My ex and I did the same thing with a 2006 Corolla back in the day kind of.  We bought it from the only dealer that had one.  Thankfully John Elway didn't add wheel locks.  Anyway, bought a set of steelies and winter tires mounted and balanced for under $600 iirc back then.  They were the Hakkipiletta with walnut shells or some such mixed into the rubber.  edit: added info about winter tires. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess the car I saw might have been older or the model above.  It wasn't the Diamante.  But the front grill stuck out an inch or so in the center, just around the logo.  The rear was pretty bad also, and the paint?  not grey not green, not silver.  STUPID. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, maybe the "news" inflates it.  I'm sure they do.  I heard on the "news" once or twice that your tires lose up to 10 psi every time the temperature drops below zero or something.  Complete B/S, it does that all winter long, every night even. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I run a lot of ski-doo (same company) snowmobiles and feel that they are really engineered well.  The Spyder does look weird though.  Never seen one on the freeway, how fast can they go?  I don't know, but I guess when you turn the handle bar the front wheels tilt into the turn.  The rear wheel looks widish.  I guess you have to ride it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I first started my job in the summer a H-D towing a trailer broke down on the highway right outside the shop.  Well, it turned out that the leaf spring for the trailer was welded directly to the axle.  He said he only had to make it to Santa Fe or something and someone welded it back on.  I think he gave the guy $100 or more. </TEXT>

<TITLE> So, I finally opened the bottle of Oy Vey teriyaki sauce </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-03 02:18:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's probably at least 6 years old, and there were a lot of solids right up near the top after I got the plastic and cap off.  Even though I shook it a bit.  So, I put the cap back on and shook the bottle harder and longer.  Well, that seemed to clear the neck of the bottle of those solids, but right away the liquid in the bottle started expanding and flowing out of the top of the bottle!  There's no stopping it, so I let some flow onto my salmon, got it stopped up and washed the outside of the bottle.  So, I cooked the salmon and ate it last night.  Am I going to die?  Also, can I eat the rest of the teriyaki sauce? </TEXT>
