<TEXT> I would have much preferred had they swapped the roles of the typhon around. 

I.e.: we got Phantoms early on, and mimics sprinkled through the early game with a larger focus on the mimicry the more you get into the game. They are by far the most interested and dangerous (mechanically) enemy in the game.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree. While for sure they also both hit kooky territory, both of them were foreshadowed by Star Lord. 

Particularly with Hasslehoff, he is a big part of Peters life. He told everyone that Michael Knight from Knight Rider was his dad, making total sense why Ego would morph into him to break Star Lords stride. 

And Pac Man eats all sorts of shit, from fruit, to ghosts, to hardcore pharmaceutical drugs. It's not unreasonable to think that he may be able to eat celestials too :P

Also, Yondu tells Peter to use his heart and not his head. Makes sense to me.  </TEXT>

100% agree with that statement.

to my original query, I just see a lot of instant dismissal of right wing views (not just on reddit) and I thought that's what I was looking at.

<TEXT> Yeah I noticed I was running around *way* more than my first couple of games. I got fourth on my second and third games in solo and then started charging around and ended up getting consistently 40-50 for about 20 matches. 

As soon as I start being a bit methodical about it I then get my first win. 

Edit: tip from a friend: if you don't mind camping whenever the white circle appears on the map, just head to a building near the centre and camp it, then do it again every time the circle moves. He consistently gets top ten but only one or two kills.  </TEXT>

It creates a bias seeing mods behave that way, and in Tysons case people feel like they can throw around the pikey term a lot around here. FYI using that word is the Romani equivalent to calling a black guy a ni***r.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Two root things:

Firstly, escapism. Playing a good single player game, whatever the genre allows me to forget about my problems, and visit distant worlds, and experience different stories. It also gives me a whole bunch of (usually) more interesting problems to solve than 'pay that bill' etc. 

Secondly, multiplayer games I see as having a game of golf or something but not needing to have to set aside half a day to do it. I can phone a mate, go online, and have a game of rocket league etc.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> We suffered from this too and while we were married five years before we understood what it was, we did get it resolved. 

If you can't go to a sexual therapist yourself, I can only tell you what we were instructed to do:

- Mutual massage three or four days a week. Not sexually at first, but massage everything. Toes, ears, butt cheeks, everything. Over a couple of weeks. Then try massaging each other's private areas with a view to orgasm. 

- while on your own, spend twenty minutes exploring your personal areas, again at least three times a week if possible. 

The goal here is to figure out what other areas you and your gf like having touched aside from your genitals. It's important not to rush this part. 

- then try working on penetration with other things than your penis. You can order dialators specifically for this (which are a really good idea). It might be an idea for her to do this herself at first, and later she can try it while you touch her in other places such as her breasts. 

- when you're ready to try actual penis penetration, we were told to try whatever position felt comfortable for the girl and work on only penetrating a little bit at a time. It's important not to get carried away here. For clarification what I mean is try spreading the lips of her vagina and pressing you glans onto them. Stop, then do other pleasurable things to get off.  Next time, go half an inch further. Girl on top is a really good one for this as it give the woman the most amount of control and she can feel when she is in pain and needs to reduce the deep ness. 


I can't tell you if this will work or not, only that it worked for us. It might also take months so don't get disheartened about it, and use LOTS OF LUBE. Liquid Silk was the only one we tried that didn't irritate my wife, so I would obviously recommend that one, but there are others that leave a tingling sensation etc. Experiment and see what one you guys like best. 

I hope this gets resolved quickly and easily for you, and I also hope that she is looking after your sexual needs while this is going on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Guildford, Surrey, England, UK

Historic old town being turned into a modern mess. It's interesting because buildings that are several hundred years old are being pulled down and replaced with futuristic messes which completely go against a town that has existed since the 11th century. It's interesting to see how town planners can cock up their job so badly. 

Besides that:

- It's one of the most expensive places to live outside of London
- It's been voted the best shopping town outside London many times
- Has many locations used in films to see in town and around the local area
- Lewis Carrol lived there
- it is the furthest point considered to be in the outer London built up area  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just a quick question for discussion. 

I don't recall any general members of staff commenting that they knew the Emporer was a Sith (or even Vader that matter) except for Vaders closest colleagues (who even comment on him being a Jedi in A New Hope). 

I just wondered if there was an in canon reason for them amount of people supporting and staffing the Empire. They can't all be evil surely? </TEXT>

<TEXT> You answer some of your questions here.

The party limit is there to balance the game. While I admit it's a lazy mechanic (Why not dynamically adjust encounters based to your party size), that's the primary reason it's there. Another reason would be to reduce the amount party chatter dialogue and needs to be implemented.

In regard to the xp loss, there are games where this is compensated for (only the player character has levels, and party members conform to that level), but these days I feel that developers use it as a reason to go out and grind XP and increase playtime for hardcore players. Some folks really enjoy that, which is why it's there but not entirely necessary to complete the game.

When it comes to party management of equipment and skills etc, that is the exact thing i **LOVE** about traditional RPG's. It allows me to attach myself mentally to the companions, as I get to know their strengths and weaknesses. It's an additional *role play* element, and a really powerful one. Baldur's Gate 2 would have been far more shallow had the player had all the abilities and all the NPC companions were there as flat DPS.

Hope that shed's some light on the other side of the coin for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hope they leave it alone for a long, long time, preferably after we've seen cyberpunk and perhaps another property from CDPR.

The three games form an *incredible* trilogy. Let them stand as the posted children of how to improve upon a product so well, in pretty much every way and how to deliver value for money in a market that is over flowing in cash grabs and junk.

Bring us back to the world, but not until the original games we've played feel like legends.


Even then, i'd like a plot to play something like:

You play as a young witcher and are sent out to deal with some monster. This leads to deeper more dangerous organised things and you are then sent ouut to find the legendary White Wolf. You search throughout the game solving several other related plotlines, but eventually you find the final resting place of Geralt and the game reveals to you that it is set some 500 years after the end of Witcher 3. This way, you can reference old characters as legends making the world feel familiar, but then makes it disconnected enough to feel fresh. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Further to /u/Ironturtle19 's comments, games you should check out would be:

**Top Tier**
- Werewolves Within 
- Until Dawn: Rush of Blood
- RIGS
- Batman
- Resident Evil 7 

( being games I consider must own)

**Good Games**
- Battlefront VR Mission (if you already have the game)
- EVE Valkyrie (multiplayer)
- Battlezone
- The Brookhaven Experiment
- Dirt VR
- Job Simulator 
- Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes (if you have local friends)

There are many, many more games and experiences available, but these I would say are the best value for money (for me). It absolutely is an early adopter device, but as we go further into its lifespan we will see more creative experiences and games. Keep an eye on Redemptions Guild and Farpoint. These two look like they will be good.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alien Isolation has very little fighting in it. In fact, instigating a fight in it is a good way to get the Alien to pay the scene a visit. While you can use that as a tactic in a way, you can summon the alien in less dangerous (to you) ways if you want some human troublemakers dealt with.

I haven't played SOMA but the game definitely is more hide and cower focused. Later in the game you are given an effective means to defend yourself from close encounters with the alien, but there are other threats that will basically ignore that weapon which imho are way scarier than the Alien itself.

If you're a fan of the original film, you should absolutely pick it up, but it is the opposite kind of horror game to Dead Space. Think Amnesia: The Dark Descent in the Alien universe. </TEXT>

This title makes it sound like Heath Ledger's, Jared Leto's, Cesar Romero's and Jack Nicholson's joker should all have the same music.

All four performances are different enough that honestly the only similarity is the name and the clownish attitude to an extent.

Why is that true for the Joker and not for Batman? Zimmer is not knocking Affleck like the title makes out, he's just saying he would find it incredibly difficult to write *new* music for a batman film that would be different to the nolan films as he is thinking about Bales performance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think thecis room for more, I mean, the game Alien: Isolation would have been the best plot line for another movie. 

I'd love to see more colonial marine action but aside from assaulting an alien home planet I can't think of anything that would remotely work very well. In saying that, the book 'The Female War' would have made an excellent alien 4.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think A LOT of this is down to Scotts original idea in that in the original ALIEN the xenomorph was not just killing people but harvesting them and morphing them into eggs, as seen in the deleted scenes of the original movie.

Personally I prefer James Camerons take in that they are like an ant colony, but I think they went with the black goo mutation thing to enable both styles of xenomorph reproduction to exist in the same canon. 

I strongly believe the reason why he is working  on 5 (!) new alien films is to try and straighten out this mess. And while I get new films should add something to the lore and mythology, this mess never needed straightening out in the first place. There is no need to radicalise the series so greatly with Prometheus.

Still, I don't want to be too quick to judge as Covenant could be great, but claiming that he's going to make another 5 alien movies does not excite me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> More power to you. You're entitled to your own opinions, and well done for standing your ground, and not being obnoxious about it.

I do greatly enjoy the game, as I said, Aloy is one of the best protagonists in recent memory, *not* because she's a woman. If that speaks to you more than me, cool. People are different, and debate and challenging opinions is what moves our society forward. 

If you liked her and having that kind of character speaks to you, you should also check out these games with interesting female lead characters:

Full Throttle (the supporting character Mo is great)
Final Fantasy X-2
Dreamfall
Mirrors Edge
Alice: The Madness Returns
Alien: Isolation

<TEXT> I read the discussion, I just don't like the fact that people need to be part of a political movement to accept that women are equal, which honestly has nothing to do with video games. It's not the rest of the discussion, but your admission that you're a feminist and that most female protagonists rely on men for motivation which I disagree with. I just feel that was irrelevant to your core point that Aloy is a great protagonist. Unless a game is a political commentary I find it annoying when people put a political spin on games. The way you describe Aloy is like her being female IS the defining factor of her. 

It's like Gone Home, it's a great little game but the way feminists and LGBT communities went crazy when it came out. The games story touched on themes uncommon in gaming, but the point I'm making is that there are games that deserve commentary on feminism, I just don't feel horizon has anything to do with it. 

Please don't take what I'm saying as an argumentative post, I'm not wanting to pick a fight. I just believe that entertainment products should not be scrutinised and made into political points unless that was the purpose or there was enough relevant material in that product.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree with your sentiment that Aloy is a victory for feminists. 

Aloy brilliantly depicts a human being. Complex. Motivated. Emotional. Capable of incredible feats of strength. Not all humans are like that, but it should not be championed just because she is a woman as her sex is entirely immaterial to the story. It should be championed as realistic writing, and an incredible performance has created the most human protagonist in recent memory. 

Aside from the feminist angle I wholeheartedly agree </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi folks,

We live in a rural area and have a pug that's allowed to roam around our premises at night (our business yard is next to our home) and last night we tied him up to his kennel as our gates are currently being repaired. 

Anyway, we were awoken early this morning to find him being attacked by an Akita who had wandered up into our complex. Currently our pug is at the vet and while I am of course concerned for him now and coming home, I also have young children.  

I have heard these dogs being discussed on the radio before and I hear that they have a bad reputation. Should I be concerned about it coming back? Are they dangerous? </TEXT>

It was her though as equipment, character model etc was exactly the same.  I couldn't retake quests I'd completed before etc. 

Initially I thought I'd been hacked but I still had about the amount of money I probably would have had, and Funcom when asked about it said they could prove no one else had logged into my account with IP address details. 

I have no idea what caused the problem but it was the complete washing of their hands of the situation that pissed me off. It was obvious something was wrong, but they wouldn't do anything to fix it.   </TEXT>

In my first example, the blood test scene in The Thing still stands IMHO as one of the most tense scenes in film. It's *exactly* why a good script, and cast, is all you need to make an incredible scene. 

In my second example, the first time I saw Saving Private Ryan, I had to pause the film after the first 15 minutes or so were over. That kind of filming had never been done before prior to that and honestly is the main reason why the film is so famous.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> While I agree with most of your points, what is going to sell a system is it's games. The PS4 is beating the Xbone in sales because it has far better exclusive games. 

Zelda is a great start to that and if Nintendo can pull off games of that quality from its first party line up of IPs, the switch will be a commercial success. Not Wii level of sales, but a success. 

Seriously though, I've been unimpressed with the switch so far, but if Mario Odyssey turns out to be good, and we see a new Metroid, and maybe the return of some other classics I'd consider getting one </TEXT>

So you'll find some companies quoting for 30m2 of underlay where the client will only need 20m2 of carpet, so I am seeing this trend go the complete opposite direction to what you're saying, although you are 100% correct. 

Seriously folks, it doesn't matter if your underlay is a million pieces. If it's under the carpet and fixed to the floor, it doesn't matter. Don't let pride and ignorance cost you more for waste than is fair.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whilst technically true, most people expect to see a 'new' roll of underlay being delivered to their home when carpet is being fitted. When I've gone into jobs with scraps, at least 50% of the time the customer has pulled me on it and asked why they aren't getting new underlay. 

So, in hindsight while people think it's shitty practice to sell you the same amount of underlaybas carpet, each roll is 15m2 standard. If your room is 13' x 13' (4m x 4m) that is 16m2 and I'm going to need to open a whole bag of underlay for a single square meter (very nearly), which potentially I may not be able to use unless I go to a job where I've been given the key so the client isn't there. 

I do not do this, but this is now why some companies are now charging underlay out *by the bag* instead of in m2.  </TEXT>

There are a handful of woven carpet manufacturers that still make a 12' wide roll, but where a roll of Wilton can take days to make, most tufting machines can produce multiple rolls of carpet in a day. 

Incidentally the reason why gauges etc are still measured in fractions of inches instead of metric is because tufting machines are an American piece of equipment is

Maybe there is an explanation for it, like perhaps it came from a classic facehugger who grabbed an engineer? I guess we'll ahe to see the movie to find out </TEXT>

This doesn't mean I don't value expert opinion as of course someone like you who's spent their life researching something is liable to know more about it than me, but to use your own analogy, it would be like a mathematician telling me 2x2 is 4 when an error here could alter the course of someone's life, and me wanting to verify that information with external sources and similar cases as people can and have made mistakes in the past.

<TEXT> I'm not saying i'm educated, i'm saying i'm surprised that people don't research this kind of thing before they stick needles in their kids is all.

M.D's *knew* smoking was a positive thing, M.D's (in the UK) *knew* Thalidomide was entirely safe to give pregnant women, and right now we *know* the MMR vaccine is entirely unconnected to autism.

The point i'm making isn't that people should not trust doctors, only that before undertaking **any** medical treatment, they should also check out the possible side effects and then once they've checked themselves (and educated themselves on that drug and it's pitfalls) can they then make an informed decision.

Why is that wrong? Why is me giving my daughter the vaccine in a different way wrong for that matter? </TEXT>

<TEXT> TBH the root of this problem has been caused by things like the Thalidomide disaster (yes I called it that) where a 'proven' medicine was later 'proven' to cause horrific defects in unborn children when a pregnant mother took the drug that was 'proven' to be safe for pregnant women.

Smoking was often touted as a medicinal health benefit for instance, and it's no good saying 'But look at what we know now!' because what we know in another 50 years may be different to what we know now and by that point it may be too late.

Just to be clear, I don't believe that vaccines cause autism etc, but you'd be a fool in todays day and age to trust everything you're told and not do your own research. For instances there is some slight controversy regarding the MMR vaccine in Britain that it may cause autism. After doing my own brief research online about it and speaking to doctors, the autism rate is far lower when the vaccines are applied separately and not in the single dose that the MMR is given as. I am happy because I have mitigated the small risk that there may be with the MMR vaccine, and by administering them seperatly my daughter is now immune.

The Anti Vaxxers just don't get that the tools are at their fingertips to make an educated decision instead of a panicky frightened one. </TEXT>

The Anti Vaxxers just don't get that the tools are at their fingertips to make an educated decision instead of a panicky frightened one.

<TEXT> I get it came out before, but for all intents and purposes SPR is the spinoff movie to Band of Brothers series.

The tone and quality is near identical, only the series story spans a far longer period. It's even produced by Spielberg and Tom Hanks.

And to iterate your point, Band of Brothers is still quite possibly the best piece of television ever made. </TEXT>

<TEXT> On a side note, this is the fungus that the infection in The Last of Us is based on.

Yes, it is a very real thing that also changes the behavior of the animal it infects. While it may not cause humans to become zombies if we ever contract a strain of it, it changes animals behaviour to maximise subsequent infections, such as making ants climb plants over colonies to die so when the spores from the fungus is released it maximises the amount of ants it infects.

Yes, nature is  as fuck, but this fungus is the most  of all. How the fuck can a fungus do that??? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is difficult to answer because even at the final encounter in the guest house she appears as firstly a little girl then as an old lady. 

My head canon is that she doesn't choose to appear as a little girl during the bulk of the game to you as she's sizing you up. She's only heard of you from Mia and wants to see if you're daddy material. 

Anyway I'm missing the point of my reply, technically Ethan must have already been infected before actually entering the house, as the flashback near the end of the game showing how eve was controlling Mia during the opening of the game, and Ethan didn't see her the whole time she was there.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reading through you're comments you are defined painting an unlikely picture. I just can't see a team of 32 pulling this off the way you're describing and having it be *good*. 

I hope I'm wrong because the glut of poor mmo's have stripped my enthusiasm for the genre, but some things *I* think you should take note of:

- Make a universe with minimal instant transportation. It really helps the sense of scale of it takes time to get places. WoW did this well with their flight paths in vanilla. 

- Encourage player interaction. Dungeon queues are handy and all that but having anything so instant really hurts the game imho. You could instead work the mechanic in where you could use a dungeon finder by finding a bar or tavern and not just being able to click a button on the UI. 

- Make crafting important. Even things as menial as food. Final Fantasy XV has a cooking mechanic where you get a buff. These buffs are huge though and make you want to have what equates to an additional 40% hp etc. Make armour and weapon crafters needed regularly by having *some* full loot pvp areas. You could have some sections of space as the 'outer rim' or something where there are no laws for instance where this could happen. 

- Don't be afraid to have same asymmetrical classes in your factions. It really helps with faction identity. For instance, the Draconis Combine could have a Dragoon tank class only found in that faction, while Greesian Alliance could have a Will-breaker debuffing healer. 

- Don't be scared of sticking to what works. Just do it better. The holy trinity for instance (tank, healer, dps) for PVE content works well, but maybe have it so these roles are exemplified in low scale pvp? I know companions have been done before, but a healer having a proper dps companion that they have to heal instead of dps'ing themselves, or a tank character having a support that needs to draw aggro from would help people learn their roles and be able to RP those styles when playing on their own. Also maybe have a choice for each faction of companions, but lock players to one where you can do quests for them and get to know them. 

Good luck, what you're doing sounds impressive but unlikely, and I hope you guys can pull it off. Does the project have a name so we can look out for it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> New characters with older characters supporting. It's never as scary when your character has faced the monsters before. 

What I'd like to see as the next game is for your main character to wake up in a big house or complex with a bunch of strangers, and for it to be flooded with monsters periodically. It could be revealed that the place is a testing facility for new BOW's and the main character and he others are there to be killed so testing data on the capability of the BOW's can be aquired. 

You could work old characters into the game by having some of the survivors contact outside for help and then have Leon or Jill or someone as a playable heavily armed character near the end of the game to go in and clean up and rescue the surviving civilians.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is an impossible conundrum where you can argue that a belief in science and a belief in god *in the purpose of creation* are exactly the same thing.

The big bang theory, is exactly that, we don't know for sure. It's assumed by scientific people who believe they've seen evidence of it in one form or another. The creation of the world as we know it by god was written in a book by a group of men inspired by another man who claimed to be the son/messenger of an alien. 

In both situations, none of us *know* for sure. I just wish people would respect other's choices in what they believe. Some people have a really condescending attitude to those of different faith (yes atheism is technically still faith that we are all a cosmic accident).

At the end the only thing we know that will ultimately bring joy to everyone is to abide by one rule: Don't be a dick.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I finished my first playthrough last night (on Normal) and played the game entirely in VR. I'll try and break my post into two elements, one for the game itself, the other for the VR seeing as a small number of people have the ability to use that at the moment. I'll also try to avoid spoilers as much as I can.

Firstly, I was really pleasantly surprised how good the game turned out to be. The demo (Beginning Hour) accurately showed how the majority of the game felt and the tension was present all the way through the game up to the final third when the game changes tempo. The presentation was brilliant, the sound design is probably the best i've seen in a recent game with random effects and doors closing nearby putting you on edge. It most definetly is Resident Evil too, with some fitting puzzles (they are pretty easy though) and a bit of campy dialogue here and there ("oh that's special" when seeing something really messed up).

The primary enemies were more interesting than I thought they would be, although I do feel they outstayed their welcome towards the end. All the enemies in the game save for the boss fights are one of three types of molded, and while the main type has a second variant, this one and the two remaining types of molded amount to about ten appearances throughout the entire game. That's one of the few things I felt was lacking from the game. 

The equipment on Normal was plentiful and to be honest while I felt I only had a little more than I needed while in the mansion, during the last third of the game you're given lots of ammo and a couple of new tools. One of those will instantly kill all of the basic molded save for one type in a single unit. The one that it doesn't kill instantly you can still despatch just as easily by predicting the very predicatble movement path of your pursuer and using a couple or three of these items. between these new items and the otherwise sudden abundance of ammo the game changed from a carefully constructed house of horrors into a mediocre run and gun action shooter. While I understand games may need a change of pace, they had the opportunity to do exactly this without altering the rest of the game during one of the flashbacks tapes but instead they give you lots of the new toys from the VHS when you return to the main game. It'd have been good if they'd have kept those for the VHS tape only.

The game left some unanswered questions (in a good way) and competently told it's story through files found around the game and some cutscenes for the main story beats. There were some contradictions though centering around some of the antagonists, and further to the ending which while I guess will be cleaned up in DLC, I think some of them (particularly the ending) may be best left till the next game.

Anyway, playing the game in VR was honestly one of the most spectacular things i've ever experienced and really elevated the game from a very good game, to and incredible one. The opening hour or so really felt amazing in VR and really showcased what a VR 'game' should feel like. It managed to really immerse you into the game without relying on motion control gimmicks (using the controller to turn items you were inspecting was a very nice touch though). I was *really* impressed with the amount of comfort controls available here too. I played the game with all the comfort controls turned off (incremental turns, reduced FOV when moving at high speed, no presence grid etc) and it was by far the best VR experience I've had. Aside from that me trying to eplain to you how good it is in VR is like trying to explain colour to a blind person. You have to try it to appreciate it. The closest I can say to it is instead of memorising a map in a game, I feel like I could walk around some part of the house now with my eyes closed. It feels like a real physical space i've walked through. 400 is a lot to pay for the game and the VR unit for PS4, but if you're flush with cash or in anyway interested in the tech, Resident Evil 7 VR is an incredible experience that anyone serious in games should try to catch at some point.

<TEXT> If we are talking broadly as a series, then yeah, the very first one most definitely was scary. Not in an OH MY GOD THIS IS TERRIFYING way, but in an unnerving, hair on the back of your neck way. That largely has been down to two things: The first game was intriguing because it was a brand new franchise, and I was fascinated with the setting and when you first come across the odd thing that doesn't fit into the mansion, I then wanted to see how deep the rabbit hole went. The second was that i'd never played a game that had proper jump scares in it, and 16 year old me had just heard the game was a gory great game before buying it. Only Resi 2 has come close to this and 3 in a slightly different way with the nemesis.

Every other game since then (6 is the only one I haven't played) has felt more like an action movie. Enjoyable games sure, but not what I would call *horror* games.

7 to me now sits second to the original (I may have some rose tinted glasses here) in terms of being a horror game. The opening hour playing in VR is some of the most intense things i've ever felt playing a game, although I do feel that is partially down to the tech and feel it wouldn't have had as big an impact as if i'd played it on PC. It did return to the unknown events / setting that the first one had, but felt less and less like a horror game as it went on. Everything prior to the second Marge fight was 100% horror focused, but then as soon as we started talking about Lucas, the game changed again into an action thriller.

Nice topic for discussion too, don't ever feel bad posting stuff like this. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  But its purpose isn't that. Its purpose is to ensure that our democratically elected legislature (parliament) agrees to what the executive (government) wants to do. That is a pretty damn standard check in any modern western democracy.

Your first point kinda also fights my answer to this one, but parliament had to agree to the government me request for the referendum. Having a second vote about the *outcome* of that just feels like a waste of time.

In any case we are in agreement that this whole thing is a shambles and that both campaigns did not relay anywhere near enough information.

When the minority has the power to change what the majority want to do, that is the very definition of the failure of this democracy. Sure parliament need to agree to this, but they already agreed to hold the referendum in the first place.

- I live close enough to London for people out of town to agree when I say i'm from London
- I live far enough out of London that I don't have London pricing (still 2nd most expensive county though)
- I was born into a decent family business
- Left school at 13 and went to work, so have 5-6 years cost free head start on saving
- My parents beat into my skull to buy a property ASAP (I paid 164,000 for a house in my hometown in 2005, and sold it in 2013 for 330,000)
- I then could afford to buy a plot of land, and am currently living in a mobile home on this plot while I build a house as I can afford it.

I appreciate that's a lot of info, but I just wanted to ram home that I am *extremely* lucky, and I am aware of that i'm like more lucky than**9**3% of the population. In any case, yeah I have a very unique position for a 36 year old man.

While I don't spend as much on me as I do my wife from time to time, I'll spend 200 np on a decent jumper. I have a penchant for Brora stuff at the minute (gotta love cashmere) and the last jumper I got from there was 315.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm in the UK and play usually after work 8pm-11pm when I do. I've never joined an empty table during these times so it seems there are plenty of players. I can't talk for daytime play though as I've never experienced it. 

As a game though even if you have lag it isn't like playing an fps game. Just switch server clusters to US and you'll be golden even if it turns out EU numbers are low during the day (although I don't think they are) </TEXT>

Post Prometheus, we have Guy Pearce playing 'Weyland', although ti could be a totally different Weyland, as Weyland-Yutani isn't a thing yet so it's still possible that Bishop was based on one of Peter Weyland's descendants. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What is most like to play in VR would be a full blown mechwarrior simulator, but I'm not sure how that would work on PS4. 

On PS4, resident evil is going to take some beating, but something in the Alien franchise would get a lot of notice from nom VR people I think. 

As far as mechanically, the London Heist honestly made into a 10-15 hour title would work amazingly. Also I have high hopes that Farpoint will be the major system seller here.  </TEXT>

Provided you learn how the game works and don't start eating a packet of crisps or start playing dubstep down your mic, folks are more than patient, and it's a great way to learn what different dialects there are and how many areas have little nuances in the language. 

You'll find you'll speak far more fluently far quicker than just hanging iut with people from the same town, and most likely meet someone who speaks the same native tongue as you who will be able to help you say the words you still don't know. It's a pretty diverse bunch of nationalities on there.  </TEXT>

Things I'm a little more concerned about is the effect on your eyes it may have looking at something that close up for extended periods, and having the pressure of the unit on your head for that time also. I do find even when trying to put the unit on as loosely as possible that after playing for thirty or fourth minutes I start to get a pressure headache.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **EVE Valkyrie** **6/10**
Fun for a short while as long as you don't burn out on it, but quickly supplanted by RiGS.

**RiGS** **8/10**
My favorite action game at the moment. Fast, with a high skill ceiling. The only drawback is that multiplayer matches often have bots.

**Werewolves Within** **10/10**
The absolute most fun i've had with my PS4. So much fun, after a couple of rounds it feels like the other players are mates and you're sat in a pub having a laugh.

**PSVR Worlds** **6/10**
Great as a demo disc or to introduce friends to VR when they come over. Ocean Descent is great for non gamers, and London Heist is awesome with move controllers and has the best gunplay yet on PSVR.

**Brookhaven Experiment** **6/10**
Again, a good demonstration for people when they come over. Has great mechanics but a smattering of content. Very decent gunplay.

**Until Dawn: Rush of Blood** **7/10**
Decent rail shooter with a surprising amount of replay value if you like to see different paths in games like this, and a good amount of collectibles. It is the cheapest method of getting replayability though. Second best gunplay on the system to London Heist. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While there definitely should be some little guards you can fit into the unit to protect the lenses included in the box when you buy PSVR, provided you stop the unit from being rammed onto your face when putting it on, you shouldn't have any problems.

I feel that there should be an update to the PS4 OS where when it detects the VR unit it reminds you not to place it as close to your eyes as possible, as it also helps to prevent fogging up the lenses. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand where you're coming from, but please remember this is technically year one tech. A glimpse if you like into home VR.

I also have two young children (10 weeks, and very nearly 4 years), so I know exactly what you mean about it being a production, but come on. It takes literally a minute to unbox the unit, and plug it into my PS4 in the evening when they go to bed. Hell, when my wife is out I even bring my sons cot into my study so I can play and with the sound down to about 50% I can easily hear him if he cries. There are games that while you can play a similar game with a regular computer or console, take on a whole different experience when in VR. There is really only 3 or 4 games I would say currently released that are actually full proper games and not 'experiences', which I guess may be part of your problem, but the system has been out what? Three months?

Werewolves Within is by far the greatest experience i've had in VR gaming since playing Xorex on the old W Industries machines in the very early ninties. Resident Evil is a prime candidate for this too. The game feels *totally* different in VR.

You are entitled to your opinion, but you say it yourself. Time will tell, and I don't think you gave VR enough time. Hopefully you'll get to try some more games in a few years when the tech has been embedded into the industry for a short while and we begin to see more games like Resi that can be played both ways, allowing VR users to get some proper games. </TEXT>

No, it isn't clearly a multiplayer game, and even that component still has some pretty major flaws. It's not a bad game, but considering its one of the most expensive games on the platform it is still pretty shy on content, that is why it gets a lot of shit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't speak directly for them as I'm a rom, but there are Irish down my road and at my kids school and nursery. 

Generally speaking from what I've seen is that the teachers will try at first and then give up on them somewhat when the mum starts rocking up to school in her nightdress and juicy couture pink dressing gown and basically using the place as day care. I want to be clear here that this is not a blanket statement. The parents that show engagement tend to help their kids in school and be proxy they perform better and then the teachers seem to be more helpful with them. It's the ones that fit the stereotype i see being left behind, and I believe that largely is due to those parents not wanting them to learn too much and risk being influenced by the gorgers. 

So in short the ones that show interest seem to get help, and the ones that fit the stereotype tend not to. This is just my personal observation though. 

As for promoting and supporting our cultures, we will learn our cultures via our families. If schools want to support us in that, truancy laws need to change.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's the only game I bought used, and I paid 25 for it which I feel is about the right price. I made a point of not buying it new so I could play it while CCP didn't get a whole bunch more money for another copy sold. While I do want to support the platform, I don't want to encourage this kind of behaviour from developers and publishers. The PSVR user base is older than the stock PS4 and rest of the console bunch, it'd be nice if the half ass production tactics didn't fly with us here on this platform. 

Many reviewers have said how light on content it is, and while the multiplayer is alright, I still prefer rigs as a multiplayer game.  </TEXT>

Give it time, this is the first time this tech has really existed for general home use and most developers are really only experimenting with VR at the moment. Let's see what happens over the next few years. 

Anyway, Resident evil is out in a few weeks and that really is the first real AAA title made with VR in mind. As you say you've been spoiled somewhat but bare with it. This is basically a new system launch.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tips I found:

- Keep the box and store your headset in it when not using it and not on one of those stands. Keeping the lenses free of dust is really important. 

- if you wear glasses try not to smoosh them to your face by sliding the unit all the way into your face as this can also severely damage the lenses. 

- although hard because when you get it you'll be itching to play it, try to start off with short play sessions first of like 20 minutes before taking a break. I never had an issue with motion sickness but several folks I have loaned the unit to have said that repeated short sessions really helped them play games like Scavengers Odyssey without throwing up by acclimatising themselves to it over a period of time. 

- There is a sale on right now IIRC on the PlayStation store. Get some games while you can. 

- While possible to play move games (motion controller) in a small space, you really need a 3m square area to flail around when playing games like Brookhaven Experiment.  </TEXT>

If the units are selling well, games should also sell well which will then promote more developers to make some VR games and push the envelope. I love playing VR games and I really don't want the medium to fail, so remember to buy your games new and not second hand ;) </TEXT>

<TEXT> The reward is the social interaction and the comedy that ensues. Honestly I've had more fun in the first few days of owning it than any other game in recent memory. 

You could indeed go play the game with friends, but then you'd get to know people's tells etc. Playing with new people everyday keeps the game fresh and engaging. Also having someone new face palm as they say at the start of a round 'I'm the saint, what do I do?" Is hilarious, particularly when it turns out they are the turncloak and it was all a sham :P </TEXT>

<TEXT> The only difference really is that the rear 60 degrees or so is difficult to aim at due to how PSVR camera detects the move controllers. This is solved quite neatly by being able to press the circle button to flip yourself 180 degrees and face back letting you quickly check behind you so it's slightly easier from that respect. 

Honestly though the game is definitely worth the 15, I'd only to watch your mates crap their pants on the first wave </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wouldn't skip any of the story content in FFXIV to be honest. 

While it isn't the greatest story in the series, Squenix seem to be focusing on one well told story per expansion instead of a single massive over arching storyline, and so far they've been pretty damn good. Plus, the way the game approaches classes (one character can do everything) there isn't a need to level up alts replaying the same story content over and over so it doesn't outstay its welcome. 

If you're remotely a Final Fantasy fan I would definitely recommended the game, as the bulk of the players I came across while playing shared my love of the series and it's good to chat with them. 

From a purely mmorpg perspective, it's very competent but is most definitely a theme park mmo (good or bad depending on your preference). The crafting system is fairly enjoyable too with a small mini game to play during crafting. 

As far as tips for a newcomer:

- Research what job you want to play before hand. The game has both classes and jobs, and a character becoming proficient in several classes opens up a job for your character (Summoner, Gladiator, Black Mage etc). This should be the number one tip as levelling classes takes time, and levelling one up that doesn't effect or cross class into your chosen job is annoying. Some classes have skills that can be slotted in other jobs too, you should look at what ones are available for each job. 

- When you get to flying mount zones the game requires you to travel around each zone and collect aether currents (basically forcing you to see the entire map before flying). It's ok collecting these while questing, but it's a pain getting them afterwards. Try not to miss them. 

- dungeons are often required to progress the story, queue for these asap as sometimes the wait for the less popular ones can be pretty lengthy.

<TEXT> To be honest, I agree with you.

I dip my toes in PVP in games like Destiny in small bite sized chunks. Every few months theres an event in Destiny that lasts a week that makes me thirst for the grind, but by the end of that week i'm so mind numbingly bored of it, I can't look at PVP for a few weeks, and then return to games like ESO or something.

What I really want from my next mmo though is a game where the focus is on the 'RP' of the mmorpg. Less stats, more getting a group together and *doing* something together that doesn't involved repeatedly running a twenty minute dungeon 5 millions times farming tokens.

I know people look at it with rose tinted goggles, but I really think the reason why UO was so popular was that while it had a dedicated PVP population, there was a large RP dynamic too. People hired other players to help them transport goods etc. They'd take over bridges and charge tolls etc. </TEXT>

She's basically just giving sass to Vader now. That also chimes with how angry sounding he is in that scene.

None of the characters had adequate backstory save for Jyn, and certainly none of them felt like they went through any kind of character arc. The movie felt like a bunch of action sequences with some exposition thrown in between and every now and then a bonk on the head "look! You're watching Star Wars! Here's another reference!!"

<TEXT> I was pretty underwhelmed. 

Maybe it's my fan goggles making it less of a movie than it really is but most of the characters were pretty throw away. I only felt that Jyn had adequate characterisation, and possibly Cassian. The rest could have been cut and not been missed. I feel the films biggest flaw was having too many main characters. Sure some are interesting (Chirrut and Baze), and K2S0 could have really done with more screen time seeing as he had some of the best lines in the film.

Everyone is cheering the CGI of Tarkin and honestly, it was terrible. Every time he's in a scene it just totally broke my immersion.

<TEXT> Alan Tudyk is todays Kevin Bacon.

He's a fantastic actor that doesn't get anywhere near as much praise for his work.

I can also recommend his own initially crowd funded show (I think it got picked up after its first season) 'Con Man' which is kinda like a self reference sitcom where he basically plays himself as an actor in a SciFi show who goes around different conventions. Nathan Fillion is also in it (and is equally amazing) </TEXT>

<TEXT> It does make her looks less feminine though and that doesn't mean she can't still be a strong female lead.

While this next bit isn't necessarily directed at you, I hate that people skate around this pseudo feminist bullshit, and the divide between your upvotes and /u/enjoytheloss2 's downvotes portray this well.

People can use words to be descriptive without being derogatory. It's very easy to guess that it is a male playing the guitar in the trailer prior to seeing Ellies face, and then you can see the feminine features of her face.

In a literal sense, she had a ponytail in the first game which is a hairstyle predominantly worn by females, the long flowing effect of a ponytail is feminine in that of itself anyway. Having far shorter hair is most definitely *less* feminine, it just doesn't make it masculine. </TEXT>

I've already been to a Doctor who has said for me to just wait it out, but my three week old son has terrible baby acne. Even googling images I can't find another image of a kid who has it as bad as he does.

Does anyone here have any experience with dealing with it? The pustules are now popping when he rubs his face and i'm scared he's going to get a nasty infection from it.

<TEXT> Locked preset builds I agree with, but I do feel that we should be able to fully customise aesthetically those titans. 

I.E: So, you have 3 titan classes, with each class having 3 models, and  each model with 3-4 preset loadouts. So you had *some* customisation where you had a choice of weaponry for that class of titan (you can't put a heavy rail gun on a light titan for instance), but you could then aesthetically unlock lots of heads arms legs and bodies for each class of titan, and colours and decals effectively giving you a set bunch of loadouts but lots of customisation for the player to identify themselves. 

They took a step in the right direction here, I just don't think they *quite* went far enough. It does give me high hopes for TF3 though  </TEXT>

I think the wait is because he is worried about what the internet will do. It doesn't matter how perfect the book is, there will be haters and if past form is to be used as a yard stick, they effect GRRM greatly. 

I think he is pulling a Valve software and is on damage limitation. The rage will be far less when not giving people the product in the first place, than it would be putting out a book that a small but very vocal minority hates. I can understand that too. The guy jus let wants to Netflix and chill, play with his action figures and retire, and after the lengthy career he's led, I can understand that. 

People rag on the show, but come on. It's *amazing* and will give people the ending that they have been waiting two decades for in under the next two years. He knows TV better than literature, he trusts D D with his apparent magnum opus, he has an escape route with Game of Thrones. It's the biggest TV show since Dallas, or well, ever. I think he's content knowing that his work gave birth to it.  </TEXT>

That statement literally sums up all the issues that I have with the game, which is a shame because with some balancing and some tuning to the movement and customisation, we could have had an amazing game instead of a pretty good one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, I feel that having griefers in an open world game like this is part of the fun. You're going to find some dicks out there in the wild who just want to watch your cobra burn.  While it's *incredibly* frustrating when it keeps happening (and to be fair your example was one of the most dick moves I've seen by any griefer), I do feel in moderation it enhances the sim experience. 

The problem is that there isn't any real way to properly balance those encounters. If you make it so people get punished for attacking unarmed ships, traders and shippers wouldn't have anything to worry about. There is no perfect system for this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't upvote this enough. There are some quite emotionally damaging things that can happen during sex, particularly with wedding night virgins. 

Being able to have a giggle about it would make something like vulvadynia or vaginismus far easier to deal with instead of compounding the problem, and take literally *years* off of sorting that kind of problem out. 

Edit: Thinking about it, not a lot of people know what Vaginismus is.  if sex is painful and super tight, it probably is that and it can be treated. Go to your doctor, or a specialist sexual therapist. It CAN be cured.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  A better one would be a building company selling timeshares (or something) in a property they were building that would be beside a stream in the country. Five months into building, the government decides to dam upstream, meaning that it dries up and there's no longer a stream beside your building. You move into it for your timeshare and see there's no stream, and blame the building company. You ignored or didn't see the letters sent to you by the company about the stream being dammed that's outside of their control and their lobbying efforts weren't successful, they offered a refund but you didn't avail of it (either through negligence or ignorance).

I have not got any emails detailing this, and it absolutely is false advertising to sell a product with a list of features on delivery. It's not unreasonable for people to be annoyed, although I'm not salty enough personally to ask for a refund. Sure the game is ok as it is, but it is NOT what was sold to me as. Using your analogy, it'd be like delivering the house with no windows, instead of them saying we couldn't pit the windows there can we move them to the other side of the house. They are just missing altogether. 

 If you pay for something two years in advance, the reasonable person would expect that there may be unforseen challenges or circumstances causing problems to that product in the timespan.

That's pretty insulting to be honest. The time factor is irrelevant and to be frank the business should be *more* inclined to deliver what was agreed instead of less when making a sale on extended delivery  terms (legally though that shouldn't make any difference). It didn't say: "These are features we hope to have in the game, but we reserve the right to change our minds" either.

Anyway it's clear your quite happy to make some pretty strong assumptions about me, maybe next time you reply I won't be bothered to read it through negligence or ignorance. 

tl;dr: I didn't buy Planetside, I bought Eternal Crusade when it said it was going to be open world, had 1000's of weapons and other features that are missing. Planetside has nothing to do with this discussion </TEXT>

When someone is selling something and tell me what features it has, if I know I'm not going to receive it until two years time, why shouldn't I expect to get what I was sold??

If you went and bought a sofa from a catalogue and was told you have to wait for an extended period of time and then the wrong sofa turned up you'd complain wouldn't you? If not, you can buy stuff from me anytime you want if you don't mind beijg given something different that what was sold to you.

I won't go into how good a game he made, most here will already know that. What is the achievement and what has proven a point is that you don't need to spend half a billion dollars developing a game to make it a success.


2. Cd Projekt Red. 

Again, there are too many others here posting this to go into details, but this is what happens when a professional outfit treat their product with the kind of care that Toby Fox gave undertale. 


3. Valve. 

People joke about it way too often, but aside from all their previous successes, refusing to put out a sub par Half Life 3, even when they know the game could be terrible and it would still sell a whole bunch proves to me again that Valve has their finger on the button.

Thought I'd make a thread about minor gripes with the interface and stuff that while doesn't effect the mechanics of the game, might be a bit of an annoyance. Hopefully someone from TC will see it and bring it up with the the folks who can make the changes. 


Please note: i'm hoping we can have some *constructive* suggestions on quality of life improvements for the game. This isn't a complaints thread, for instance don't post about packs themselves, but if you wanted to suggest changing to layout of the screen or something like that, this would be where to ask.  </TEXT>

I finished last night with 2000 credits in the bank. Do you start the game with credits already or something, as that just doesn't sound right.  </TEXT>

Edit: Destiny was made for consoles from the ground up making it a 'console shooter'. BF4, Overwatch etc were all made and released on PC meaning development was also made with PC in mind.

<TEXT> Yes, Destiny is this generations best console shooter. Honestly, I think that says more about the games industry in general at the moment more than anything else. 

Destiny is not a bad game and has great shooting mechanics,  it is also the poster child of why too many publisher fingers can ruin an otherwise great game. I'm more interested to see if half of the cut content makes it back into Destiny 2 next year seeing as they now won't be supporting last gen consoles, and are in fact bringing it to PC (rumour).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can have a government organisation look at a business, what it does, the image of the company and who it has hired to deem if it is fair or not. 

If there is some kind of discrepancy, that business should be looked at in a case by case situation to assess if it's being unfair, or if the discrepancy is appropriate for the business itself, or its image. 

I.E. if you had business selling feminine hygiene products you'd think it'd be acceptable for there to be very few or any men at all to be working there. So if a man complained he was turned down for that job because he was a man, in this case it would sort of be acceptable, because some clientele may be uncomfortable with discussing their needs with a member of the opposite sex. 

I know what I'm going to say next is an unpopular opinion here as Reddit has a 'stick it to the man' attitude to business, but the needs of the business should be primary concern. When quotas cause a detriment to the business meaning it may earn less money because of it, people seem to forget that if the business fails, then more than the one person who wasn't hired will be out of a job.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not against sexually explicit images at all, I don't understand how you get that when I said how diverse the body is, all i'm saying is that nude art in the case of photography (IMHO) should be more about the composition of the image, the lines created by the body or absract creations using it. This gallery doesn't do that for me, particularly seeing as it's titled thighs and the focus on most of the images is the crotch. Fingers are lifting the edges of skirts etc, they are just way more erotic than the nature of the gallery leads us to beleive

To answer your question more directly, this is a gallery, not just one image </TEXT>

<TEXT> Porn isn't creepy because it's porn. It becomes creepy when it's trying to pass itself off as something that it isn't. This is the thing though, art is so subjective. I saw a clip of a woman who was putting paint up her vagina and squirting it out from like ten feet in the air and saying the mess was 'art'. Did she *need* to squirt it out of her vagina to make it art? To her it was, but to me she could have dropped the paint from her hand and produced the same result, making the sexual organ part irrelevant to the art.

You could argue the *Act* of doing it was art, but I wouldn't say that applies to photography, where the person admiring the art is not going to see how the image was taken. </TEXT>

I had no idea that he'd been accused of sexual crimes but I guess I can see that being probable, I hope for his and his models sakes though the impression I get from his work is wrong.

Generally I would say that nudity where it is not what makes the image interesting is art. You shouldn't need a nipple or an ass in an image to make someone look at it. The human body is an incredibly diverse, interesting thing. Many photographers can shoot an image where the focus is absolutely about the image and not the subject. </TEXT>

Having a model put stickers of your face on their nipples for a shoot for instance is absolutely creepy in my book. (Emily Ratajkowski is the model i'm talking about if you want to google the images)

I'm not saying you're wrong (the majority of Yuria's images imho I would consider art, but there are some that do have a creepy vibe), but just putting it out there that it is no way an absolute statement of fact that having permission prevents creepy photos from being creepy. </TEXT>

He said he doesn't feel bad about it, as technically he didn't do anything wrong. While he *did* feel a bit inadequate about it at first after he sat and digested it he just said that he wanted her to be happy after spending so long together, even if it meant her leaving him. 

I know this doesn't sound like a happy ending for him but this happened 4 years ago, and he moved in two years ago with his new girlfriend and has taken up cribbage and cocktail making. So yeah he seems pretty comfortable now hahahaha

It's going to feel pretty shit for a while but it will get better.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, I can't really give you a good answer to this.

Just over a year ago I would've said hands down Wlad, but after seeing Fury out box him (yes, people said it was boring, but it was a *boxing* match after all) i'm on the fence.

Fury has shown he's capable and deserves the current title of World Champ, but that still doesn't mean that he technically is as skilled a boxer generally speaking *right now*. He still has years left of his career though, and I have high hopes for him. If he can keep his ego in check while training and fighting, and use it to demoralize his competition, he has the potential to be legendary. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is the reason why i'm looking forward to the NES Classic.

I was going to splurge on a proper console after spending some money on the WiiU virtual console store, but to get those games and a working NES i'd be spending well over 600. I can now get the NES Classic which I can plug into my current TV set without having to either get an adapter or an old TV set and play all those games for a tenth of the price.

I really don't understand why more companies don't do this as a matter of routine with their older games consoles. I'd seriously pay 200 no problem for a working current TV compatible system and a batch of it's best games with a few rarities thrown in.

Imagine getting to play all those old N64 games again on holiday whenever you want and only need to carry around an item as big as a pint of milk? </TEXT>

It was only really since FF8 where they've attempted to get some realistic characters in there and maybe the battle graphics of FF7.

Edit: yes I know chibi is a particular art style, however they both look the same to me. If you think that the old sprites in the 8 and 16 bit games didn't have big heads and eyes, go back and look again.  </TEXT>

1) She wanted to help her friend stick to her morals.
2) She didn't really do anything bitchy to justify the way she died, making her tragic.
3) She really *really* reminds me of poindexter from the Revenge of the Nerds films.

Other than that though the nostalgia alone is enough. Shes a way over the top characture of everything I remember about the average teenage girl growing up in the eighties. THOSE JEANS. Omg. Nostalgia overload. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is less pressure on DPS classes to know mechanics for fights etc, and ranged DPS tend to take less damage so that makes Hunters and Mages your go to classes. Technically Druids can be ranged too, and also can Tank or Heal so if you're not sure how you want to play, whilst tricky to learn they might be a good bet long term. 

The other three way hybrid class would be Paladin but they are melee. 

Don't be afraid of rolling a known ranking or healing class though, they all have DPS specs for you to use, and also mean you can try other roles without having to refill another toon. Just remember if you do well as DPS and start doing Heroic and Mythic dungeons to start at the bottom teir normal dungeons if you decide to try a different role and that you have the relevant stat gear. IE: I play a Restoration Shamen as a healer, but when I get bored or want to chill because Elemental Shamen use Intellect as their primary stat as well as Restoration Shamen, I don't need to switch out so much gear. 

Another interesting feature is that you can now right click on your character portrait and select what kind of loot you want. So, you can quest and dungeon your heart out as a healer and then any loot you find can be selected to drop as tank gear for your class if you wish it. 

The best piece of advice for a new player though honestly would be just read through all the descriptions, and see what takes your fancy. If you live out your fantasy as a knight in shining armour you'll enjoy the game far more than you would playing a heretic Warlock you picked because it sounded easy to play for instance.  </TEXT>

If you haven't already do the early quest that gets you a disguise. Once complete you get to keep it and use it at any point. 

Also the inconspicuous baskets you see littered about? Mobs swagger if you're in one and you can reapply the disguise if you're inside one.  </TEXT>

I guess we'll have to wait and see. I hope that it would be technically possible to melee your way through the game without getting bored. There is a real lack of melee centric first person games around. 

On a side note, if you like that kind of gameplay you should try Chivalry. It's multiplayer but has a really good melee system.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I helped organise the 40 man raids in Vanilla WoW for a semi top tier Horde guild on our server (EU Bloodscalp) and while there were some *incredible* moments, it was painful too.

I mean, trying to organise and keep that many people focused for 4-5 hours a time is almost impossible. Back then as well I feel that the bog standard difficulty was kinda in between heroic/mythic (at least it feels like it today), you're tanks would need very specific gear, which would tank several weeks to acquire for one of them.

Trying to organise (IIRC) 8 groups on the Core Hound Packs before fighting Magmadar (again IIRC, its been a while), was incredibly difficult, but the first time we beat them and then took Magmadar down after like 2 tries was amazing and way up there with my fondest mmo memories.

But basically, the more difficult it is, the better the payoff afterwards. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's certainly been the least problematic, but I honestly believe that is largely down to the fact that Blizzard flat refused to merge servers and have cross realm phasing now. So, if WoW is at 50% of its peak subscriber base now and they still have all the server infastructure in place to cope with the numbers at their peak, and they also basically have the means to instantly load people to any server they see fit as and when demand dictates, i'm really not surprised. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I mained a rogue from vanilla to wotlk because I wanted to do the best DPS. Hell, the game manual said in it that Rogues were undisputed kings of DPS. Then they actually re-wrote the class description from that when Rogue were caught up by mages and other classes. Why take a Rogue when you could take a Warrior who is also melee DPS in two of its three specs, and will also absorb less damage?

But again to argue your point, why would they then give hunters a melee spec???

Thanks for a proper response though </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I think it's pretty easy to say that people are enjoying the new Outlaw spec for rogues, but IMHO the other two specs still feel pretty similar to each other. 

What would people say about dropping the assassination spec and replacing it with a 'Gunslinger' spec, giving Rogues a ranged spec, and basically doing for hunters what Survival has done for them?

There isn't anything really resembling an old west kind of characterisation in Warcraft anyway so it may be against the lore or something, but I think it'd be a pleasant change for Rogues.  </TEXT>

-Creating Board Games

-Angry Video Game Reviews
-Angry Movie Reviews
-Crossover videos

This is alongside all of the things normal people like to do. Frankly I'm amazed he puts out as many videos as he does. 

Yes I would love for there to be an Angry Video Game Review once or twice a week, but these obviously take A LOT more time, thought and resources to put together than a movie review consisting of three guys sitting facing a camera and discussing what they did and didn't like about it. People shat on him when he did the rapid fire reviews which aside from him being on camera is essentially the same thing as the movie reviews, which to be honest were fine. We'd still have gotten the angry reviews on the bigger titles.  

I'd rather have 8 reviews per month where he gives his thoughts and jokes on a game than one a month where we get to see him play dress up.  </TEXT>

I resubbed a little while back and went there but during my travels I couldn't hear the vocal element to the music. Did they change it? I have the soundtrack on .mp3 and in sounds fine when playing it in iTunes or playing a video of it via YouTube, but the vocal part just seems to be missing when actually in the game.

Anyone else notice this? Do I have the game audio settings messed up? and if so how do I change it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I thought about this before. I'd like for there to be a set of poses/emotes for each zone dependant of class.

For instance, if you left a Druid in Ungoro Crater, when you logged in you'd see them tending to some of the plantlife there. While if you selected a hunter who was logged there, they could be shown stalking a dinosaur.

You could have a Rogue logged at Stranglethorn where the login screen would be your character in the tavern at Booty Bay flipping a heathstone board and pulling a pistol on their opponent.

There are loads of possibilities like this, but I don't see Blizz putting in the time to implement this when there isn't really going to be any financial gain from it. I've never heard anyone say "I'm not subbing to that game, have you seen how bad the login screen is?!" </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mission 4 is probably the true start of the game where you have a decent selection of tools and the game throws the majority of its problems at you for you to tackle. 

In any case, the best piece of advice I can give you is not to use the same sort of tool or method to get around the alien all the time. There is only one of them and he learns fast and will soon ignore them and come look to see where that flare was thrown from etc. 

If you're really stuck, aliens don't like fire and a well placed Molotov can really save you're skin. 

You might find like I did that the working joes are a bigger problem. Emps work wonders on them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a fat kid, I can tell you now, do not under any circumstances MAKE him go training. He will hate the whole time he is there, and resent it and when it comes to lifting, as you will probably know, trying to lift weights when you aren't trying very hard is a pretty pointless and possibly dangerous thing to do. 

I didn't start training until I was 30, and by that point 157kg (350lbs approx). Do you want to know what got me interested in training? Arnold Schwarzeneggers life story, Total Recall (an awesome read for anyone tbh). Reading that book and his determination, what he did to get where he was (he was a millionaire way before he started movies), was all started by his lifting. That was the catalyst that got me in there. 

The next part was keeping me in there, which was taking my iPad, buying a tv series or game I could play, and then watch said series, or play the game when I was on the reclined bike or some other machine. I went three days a week, and kept pushing until 45 minutes of the walking dead had finished. It was hard for like a month, and sooner or later Id continue cycling or on the vario for another 15-20 mins before finishing. Then it became a chore to watch something while working out. A month after that I was in the studio, doing classes, and a month after that I would go in the gym early in the morning to use the studio on my own and put my own circuits together. 

Anyway, what I'm trying to say is, if he was anything like me the very idea of going to the gym was a pain in the ass. It was the thought of me spending time in the gym when I could be gaming (even at 30 years old) if I'm honest was the biggest turn off. Fix that, and you stand a shot and may fix your sons motivation. Ask him to train with you sure, but ultimately if you want him to enjoy it, he needs to *want* to be there.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ever since the U.K. Olympics cycling event, EVERY damn weekend my local area is overrun with cyclists.

I live in Surrey and the main route went right across the top of my road and now it takes literally four times longer to get anywhere by car during daylight hours.  I'm talking 20 minutes to get somewhere that would normally take like 6. 

I now have to ensure we are fully stocked of tea and bourbons on Fridays, otherwise if starve while on route for the emergency trip to my local spar shop </TEXT>

<TEXT> The game was always marketed as B2P with a small cash shop with nothing P2W in it, and that as it was a B2P game it would never get P2W features. Since launch:

- The starting cash shop items give pretty large advantages over people who don't spend. Particularly the pets and ghille suit.

- More items were added to it later increasing this disparity.

- The creators/publishers of the game added an NPC that sells end game gear for ingame silver.

- The most recent change means that people can now buy cash shop items and then sell them on the marketplace for ingame silver, meaning anyone prepared to drop a couple of hundred bucks can get endgame gear really quick making a B2P game have a very P2W cash shop.

Nearly everyone I know who was playing has left the game in the last few weeks and many of them have asked their card suppliers for charge backs or raised payment disputes with Pay Pal claiming false advertising, which to be honest I can kinda agree with.

People are leaving this game in droves, and I believe it'll go F2P within the next couple of months. </TEXT>

I'll let you know if I find any more.

EDIT:

Seems it was a promotion he did in 2009 where over a weekend he put forward for screening and discussion a bunch of films. I'm kicking myself that I missed it all:

I literally yesterday was discussing with my wife how awesome it would be if each year Sky Movies had a weekly film slot dedicated to a famous actor/director/writer discussing a favourite movie, giving it their critique and then screening it. She asked who I would most want to do that, and I said QT.

Like him or not, his knowledge and love of film is unparalleled and I'd love to hear his thoughts on many movies, even those that i'm not a particular fan of, just because he has the power to change my perception of them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, if I understand it correctly:

Imagine you have 16 cookie jars, each with a different flavour cookie, but without knowing what flavour is in each.

This tech basically allows you to have your hand in each cookie jar at the same time, and once you try one cookie, you'll know whats in another jar. So, what traditionally would have taken a minute or so to find out what all the cookies tasted like, now you could find out in a fraction of the time, all without making your hand move faster.

<TEXT> Legitimate ways, selling EPP mods is IMHO the largest single hit income, but as others have said the most reliable way is farming, or looting and selling weapons etc. Farming and cooking is by far the safest way. I can recommend fish pie which is fairly easy (1 raw fish + 1 mashed potato). With some perseverance you can spawn an npc who sells the fish with a colony deed making it far easier to make the food. 

Illegitimate is another thing entirely, but I'm not sure if I can talk about that without getting banned from the sub. 

Edit: why downvote? Because I know *how* to cheat? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah i'd love to see that also, but I don't see anything on the horizon doing both the source game justice, and being an outstanding movie, unless the game could have been a movie anyway.

For example, people rave that they want a The Last of Us movie, which could work if the story beats could be condensed to make a 10 hour games journey with a pair of characters be as impactful at the end as a 2 hour films journey would be, I just don't see people becoming as attached to the characters over that smaller period of time.

The opposite of that and what I don't see could ever work as a game (**SPOILERS** if you've never played it) would be **Undertale**. It'd be impossible to have the same kind of effect as a film due to it being impossible for a film to react to you and your decisions.

Like you though, Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotillard and Brendan Gleeson all seem to have a knack for picking good projects to work with (or maybe it's just their screen presence!) and I also am quietly confident about Assassins Creed being a very good movie in it's own right. As a *video game* movie though? I'm not so sure. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Early Game tips thread </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-24 19:33:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> EDIT: Guys, remember this is supposed to be 'Early' Tips, half the fun of the game is discovery so try not to spoil 2nd/3rd tier stuff etc.

Thought I'd post some tips that I would've found useful for the early game. 

- To upgrade your workbenches, open them, then mouse over the top button that says UPGRADE to get a tooltip telling you what you need to upgrade it.

- Food goes off if left long enough, however wheat *never* goes off until you process it, so it's a good thing to stockpile early in the game until you can get refrigerators. 

- Farm lots of wood and plant material and craft lots of Wood Platforms for your excavation trips and make mine shafts with them as you dig.  You can't teleport out of the underground, and being able to get to the surface quick is REALLY handy. I find it works better than ropes because if you fall you won't take fall damage of you do it right. 

- You can remove the back panels of dirt underground and if you are high enough (highest background graphics only) you *can* teleport to your ship while underground. 

- Escort quests are a pain but really lucrative. MAKE SURE you remove any floor spikes you anything your charge can walk though and hurt themselves with, it's almost instant death for them. 

- Hunting spears are a great early game weapon, which also causes animals to have a much higher chance to drop meat, and are really easy to craft. 

- don't make a base on your ship, but instead make a small holding on your starter planet. You pretty much have to farm for food in this game, and having a place where you can grow potatoes and wheat is really helpful early on. 

- You can cook food at a station on the ground floor of the first Outpost town you come to. This was a life saver as eating cooked food reduced your hunger far more than eating raw food. 

- Be careful when looting random towns on other planets. Dismantling furniture and walls etc will make the local populace hostile to you although you can take things out of cupboards etc pretty freely. 

- Get your first tech upgrades ASAP. The professor looking guy in the middle of the middle floor in the Outpost can give you the quests to get them. They are really quick and being able to double jump is a god send. 

- Be sure to explore the surface of other planets too. You might find abandoned research stations, temples and other oddities. 

- Flags (Human Flag etc) allow you to teleport from your ship to whatever exact point you place it at. Use these to travel to your home base easily, or whenever you find somewhere you want to come back to (a settlement, etc).

Added by /u/ Zafis

- In early game you'll want to get Lantern Stick for back slot, or mining helmet as soon as possible. Easier to mine with portable light that's always on. Later on you can add light augment to your environment suit.

- Good to know thing about stats is that your armor also boosts your damage. So always get the highest when you can.

- Spike sphere for head slot tech should possibly be your first purchase. It makes climbing up mountain walls easy and fun. (and is also awesomely metroidesque!)

Added by /u/Sivuden

- For first time players, keep going past the second portal at the space station-- that's where the main quest progression lies.

Added by /u/Captain_Midnight

- Tungsten is actually not present on the starting planet. This is by design. You have to visit another planet to find it. Unfortunately, the game also doesn't do a great job of explaining stellar navigation. There are actually a number of other planets in your starting solar system. But you'll never see them unless you sit down in the captain's chair of your ship and click on the magnifying glass icon in the upper-left of the map.

Added by /u/24hsifyppols

- Holding Rightclick and release for bows secondary volley attack (and many other weapons!)

Added by /u/AbrahamsterLincoln

- Press 'x' to switch between your first and second hotbar. You can have up to 12 slots this way.

Added by /u/Ysida

- You don't have to make house at first planet just pickup campfire with you.

- Stack healing at begin 20 x salve would be enough.

- Get first workstations.

- Try to spam special attack if your weapon have one and kite your enemies if you have to.

- If you see big hole don't try to jump you will prob die by fall damage.

- Always have 75%+ your health shit happens.

- At boss fights try to not force damage when you are low. (escape kite get on safe zone whatever)

- Triple jump TECH is very good for people that don't like gravity

- One hand means that you can grab something else with your hand. 2x onehands | one hand + shield | one hand + with rope

- Don't be afraid to use torchs ( i know that flashlight is awesome)

- Later you upgrade your manipulator to scan objects act like flashlight.

-Remember to have rope/platforms |healing source at your hotbar

-Use each item at your inventory to survive. throws stimpacks everything.



I'll add more here as I think of them or if you have any tips I'll edit them into this one if you reply here.

<TEXT> This. When I first bought the game at the beginning of EA, it really felt like Terraria in space. Now, after a break of like a year (I only racked up like 20 hours in EA anyway) this game now feels different enough to hopefully not be passed off as a copy/paste job. 

I just hope that they provide post release content updates. It's a REALLY effective way of extending your player base.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My opinion:

It was a below average movie, but a terrible *Ghostbusters* movie. I feel after the backlash and the accusations of sexism, this will get artificially high marks.

There was literally nothing in this film save the logo and a few references that connected it to the franchise in any meaningful way. It honestly felt like a Ghostbusters/Bridesmades cross over. Maybe due to the furor prior to this the female toilet jokes just seemed stupid and only to say 'LOOK!! WE'RE WOMEN', rather than being funny. I mean, the whole 'That was from the front' gag set the tone for the whole film. 

Not only that, but so many scenes reminded me of the famous spaceship roll scene in Prometheus. So many things happened that most people would just not do. The police not arresting them after the Bill Murray cameo for instance.

Anyway, there WERE some good jokes in there, and some solid action sequences. It just baffles me why they needed to put the Ghostbusters name to it, save for the name drop to get bums on seats. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a shame really because they've made a mistake planning the job and thats why the floor doesn't line up, and even so, the discrepancy between the two types of plastic tiling could have been minimised to the eye had they started fitting the wood from the middle instead of the side under the kitchen plynth.

Had they done this, the floor would not visually seem to be so far out as it does. You notice how those grout lines in the wood effect floor don't line up properly? Not only is that fixable anyway, but even if it wasn't, starting the install from the center would have prevent it looking like it runs out so much overall. We can't see the left hand wall in the phot, but if the entire floor increasingly runs out form left to right, I bet it's pretty bad. However bad that is, starting in the middle would have made the worst part of that floor only 50% as bad as this floor.

If i've explained that right :P

Edit: wow downvotes because I'm pointing out that it's possible to fit the job better? I had no idea folks were that easily pleased by poor workmanship.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its a mistake in the planning of the tiles I believe. It looks like LVT to me (plastic tiling) which for this design is most likely custom cut by the manufacturer. Most likely that the imitation wood section having grout lines/feature strip was never mentioned to the manufacturer so thats why each line runs out 3-5mm.

Secondly, this could have been minimised had the fitters started from the middle of the floor and not from the side. Currently the floor runs out from right to left and we can't see how much of it runs out due to it, but had they started in the middle the absolute worst it could be would be 50% of however bad that left side is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the install was botched. Irrespective of it being LVT or ceramic, if the fitters installed the wood section starting from the middle like you should, the fact that the width of the wood   grout/strip is actually slightly bigger than the width of the tile   grout/strip could have been made less apparent. I guarantee this floor will continue running out the further left you go. You can't see the left hand wall, and common sense says that it will be worse there.

Had they started from the beginning in the middle, the maximum it would run out would only be 50% of however far it now runs out on the left side. </TEXT>

If you've been in the flooring trade you will know there are customers who want what they want and no amount of advice will dissuade them :P

Also where do ceramic tiles last forever? They crack and its a pain in the ass to replace them. LVT can be heated up and a single tile be replaced in minutes if need be. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, but I discussed this with Neil from Karndean when I did the installation course with them some time back so it can be done, and re bevelling a cut tile is really simple to do. Karndean actually sell a small tool specifically designed for it, but I use a mouse plane (what you'd usually use for trimming weld rod on safety flooring). Resting one edge on the sub floor and one edge on the side of the tile you want to bevel you can very easily get a perfect edge in a few seconds.

If you've never done it, I highly recommend you do the installation courses. It's incredible what can be done with these kinds of floors.

<TEXT> This looks like LVT to me (Luxury Vinyl Tiles) a product more widely known as Karndean or Amtico although I can't tell the brand that has been used here.

It's a shame really because they've made a mistake planning the job and thats why the floor doesn't line up, and even so, the discrepancy between the two types of plastic tiling could have been minimised to the eye had they started fitting the wood from the middle instead of the side under the kitchen plynth. I'm pretty confident that the design strip (the stuff that looks like grout on the wood) was either decided to be used after the floor was planned, or folks forgot that it would increase the size of the width of the plank making it run out. Most manufacturers such as Karndean can provide a custom cutting service for an additional cost so had it been discussed with the supplier this could have been sorted pretty easily.

Here's a similar hexagon floor on Karndeans blog, only without the strip and with less critical cuts meaning you can more easily put different designs next to it: http://www.karndean.com/en-gb/commercial-flooring/our-blog/2016/may/cdw-review

If you're not familiar with the product, have a flick through their website for a bit. It's a brilliant floor covering and very easy to live with, and incredibly easy to customise. Motifs and borderwork is all relatively easy to do once you grasp how to actually plan for it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually, I think you're both sort of wrong and right at the same time.

It looks like LVT or Karndean to me which put simply is vinyl tiles. You can see he's made a mistake laying it because they have started the wood portion from the side of the room instead of the center to minimise the fact that the wood strip is not designed to have design strip (plastic grout lines). This product is pre manufactured and designed to be put together a specific way, and had they fitted the wood without it, it would line up properly anyway.

Even if it had been custom cut by the manufacturer (companies like Karndean can, but they will do this for a premium), the end user probably put the wood strip next to it as an afterthought as if it had been discussed with the manufacturer how they were planning to do it, the hexagons could have been cut ever so slightly smaller to suit.

<TEXT> Someone spoiled the end of the movie, specifically how they defeat the big bad. This movie just sounds like a girl power movie using a Ghostbusters skin as a launch pad. 

I'll go see it I'm sure, but it already makes me think it's a political tool movie instead of just a movie.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I regret buying the game. It isn't a massive mmo style shooter anymore. It isn't teh idea that was sold to me any more. Sure it's fun if you have a decent team but it kinda feels like Battlefield: WH40K right now, where I was expecting more of a planetside game where you could walk into different zones etc.

If I had bought the game after release, and had been expecting the game it currently is I probably wouldn't have taken any notice, but between this, Starbound and Star Citizen I doubt I will be greenlight/early access funding anything anymore

<TEXT> The fact that Ramsey makes his wife fuck his dogs, and that he makes Reek perform cunnilingus on her before he consummates the marriage.

Many book readers (inc me) were pretty terrified in the episode where Ramsey marries then subsequently rapes Sansa. It sounds awful, but there was a sort of sigh of relief at that disturbing sight. It should have been doggedly worse if we were following book plots to the letter. Excuse the pun, I can't help myself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> --Frodo Baggins-- *Grammostola pulchra* **Brazilian Black Tarantula**

Kind tempered, good looking and not afraid of feats of endurance, these guys are capable of fasting for months when the need calls for it.


--Samwise Gamgee-- *Grammostola rosea* **Chilean Rose Tarantula**

Basically the same as the Brazilian Black, only not as pretty, more lethargic and well, 'rounder'.


--Gimli, Son of Gloin-- *Sicarius hahni* **Six-Eyed Sand Spider**

This rather odd looking specimen hides underground ready to pounce with AND MY AXE like fangs on unsuspecting prey. Also, dirt and bits of sand seem to cling to it making it look dirty all the time and it has a terrible sense of direction.


--Boromir of Gondor-- *Portia fimbriata* **Fringed Jumping Spider**

This guy is a famous hunter to its peers, and happens to mimic movements of its prey, making it feel like the spider wants to be it's bro. SPOILERS It then takes the opportunity when it presents itself and stabs it's prey in the back and chows down on it's meal which happens to be other spiders. So yeah, this is the kind of spider you think is your mate who then really fucks up your day.


--Legolas, Son of Thranduil-- *Bagheera kiplingi* **Mexican Bagheera** (IIRC this name is correct)

This jumping spider is famed not just because of it's speed and lethality, but also because it actually doesn't want to kill stuff. It's quite happy munching on plant fibres normally used in the symbiotic relationship between the Acacia and Acacia Ants, resorting to predation only when it truly needs to. If there was such a thing as a vegan spider, this would be it.


--Gandalf the Grey-- *Maratus volans* **Peacock Spider**

What is there to say about this species, other than it is the coolest spider species i've ever seen and just looks amazeballs and every other spider wishes it was it. It doesn't come back from the dead though like the wizard unfortunately.


--Peregrin Took-- *Pholcus phalangioides* **Cellar Spider**

These guys are stupid looking, annoying and downright clumsy. Not to mention that they ALWAYS get in places where you don't want them. You could also say this is the cousin Eddy of spiders. It'll empty it's shitter right in front of people like it doesn't care either leaving lovely carcasses of its prey all underneath its web.


--Meriadoc Brandybuck-- *Isopeda villosa* **New South Wales Huntsman**

The NSW huntsman wants to be your bro. It'll take care of the things you want kept out of your house if you'll have it around, and if you throw it out it'll forgive you every time and keep coming back, usually with a gift of some kind of bug largely more irritating that itself. Ultimately though, it's got your back.


EDIT: I'm not a spider expert, I just wanted to accept the challenge :P </TEXT>

<TEXT> Looks a lot like Zelotes Duplex to me, a pretty common ground spider and found in many places throughout the world. They usually hunt a bit like huntsmen and don't usually spin webs except for breeding purposes, instead being quick little blighters and physically stalking and chasing down their prey. If these guys were movie characters, these guys would be Strider from Lord of the Rings. Keeping itself to itself but more than capable of taking on nasty things when it needs to :)

Here's an American cousin for comparison although I am not certain that it is the same strain or not:

<TEXT>  hen again, he doesn't have to... But that's gonna screw him hard

That's just it though. It's his channel and he can do what he likes with it.

From a business perspective I can understand why he's doing it, you tubing is most likely not going to be a long term business so he's getting as much money for the least expense as he can. Angry reviews cost a lot more to produce that a couple of cinema tickets for a film review, or when he's paid directly to showcase as specific product. 

SMart short term business to be honest, I just don't expect he'll be around in any major capacity in a few years which IMHO is a shame. Hopefully when YouTube goes tits up (it will eventually, no way Google will permanently host YouTube all the while it isn't profitable for them), he still has enough credibility to get hired by some other site or has enough money to start his own venture.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys,

Anyone else get weird minor graphical glitches with the ingame HUD?

For instance, around the ultimate meter parts of the white circle that surrounds the icon may intermittently disappear and reappear and random points on the screen. I may be the little 'q' key symbol broken up around my crosshairs, or if i'm playing mercy I might get healing bars broken up all over the screen.

I've tried reinstalling the game, display drivers, changing resolutions and display qualities and nothing seems to alter it. When I first installed the game it was fine but ever since the McCree nerf I have had these graphical glitches.

I currently use a pretty decent rig (I can run the game at 4k at 60fps +) and never have any issues at all, let alone remotely like this in any other game. Does anyone else have a similar issue and know how to fix it?? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey folks,

I'm from the UK and wanted to know if anyone else feels like the game lags a lot. I mean, it *looks* like you're connecting with shots, but it just doesn't seem to count. I really struggle trying to hit people with Bolters of any kind.

This goes for melee too, i've swung at an opponent three times before they spin around and one shot me, and then the death stat readout says the enemy has loads of health (last one I had was 86%) when I clearly hit the enemy at least twice (they started moving on the third swing).



Is this lag? Or do I just suck that badly and like making excuses :P </TEXT>

<TEXT> Apologies of this is not allowed (I didn't notice anything in the rules but some subs rule against this) but CDkeys.com is selling Doom preorders at 23.99 including DLC (not the season pass, just skins etc) and steam is 39.99. 

Seems like a very good deal and thought it'd interest you folks.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Trying to remember a 1980's military arcade game </TITLE>

<TEXT> Hey guys,

I used to play a game in my local sports centre as a kid and wanted some help finding out what it was.

You could play two players simultaneously, and it was against each other, where each player would control a soldier in training. One stage would have your joystick moving a cursor around the screen shooting targets, another would have you spamming your buttons to crawl faster under barbed wire etc. The game could have had proper combat levels, but I don't think I ever got past the second stage.

It would have been late 80's (it was 1987 when I started Karate at the sports centre), as I seem to remember the game looking possibly 16-bit. If I remember rightly it was made by Bally Midway, but I could be wrong about that. I remember they had Xybots and Gauntlet next to it so again, that should give some indication of timeframe.

Does this spring to mind for anybody? I'd appreciate any help finding out what it was.

Thanks </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, we are pretty much as confirmed as we can be that Brother Clegane is going to be appearing in some capacity in Season 6. While this solidifies the gravedigger theory from probable to almost certain, it in no way makes the hype machine that is Cleganebowl ^^^^TM any more real than time travelling babies.

I can see that season 6 is shaping up to be great (and not just because we are starting to head into uncharted territory post ADWD), but don't let the butthurt of no Cleganebowl ^^^^TM put a downer on what could be a stellar season.

Sorry to get all parental on /r/asoiaf but it needed to be said. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey /r/music

I've fairly recently been listening to lots of Carpenter Bru, Perturbator, Vangelis, MegaDrive and others, but aside from lucking out on youtube and finding videos, and the odd game or movie that has that kind of soundtrack (Hotline Miami, Drive), where can I find more music like this, or can you recommend any other artists for me to listen to?

For those unfamiliar with the style i'm talking about, here are some links to some of my favorite tunes:

Carpeter Bru - Turbo Killer  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=er416Ad3R1g

<TEXT> Hey guys,

I just wondered if anyone had run into any bugs with cooking. I've been messing around (its more fun that way) with cooking but after agges i bit the bullet and looked up some simple looking recipes.

Making fried fish, beer, boiled eggs and a few others, I tried making meat pies with the following ingredients and after looking it up it seems I should have got the discovery.

Lamb x6
Potato Dough x6
Sugar x6
Deep Frying Oil x6

I since got the quest from Olivia and made the boiled eggs, but the next quest is impossible because I can't make Fried Vegetables. (im at cooking beginner lv.9)


Anyone else have this bug? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey fellow Commanders,

I just had this really weird bug on the final mission where aliens would literally do nothing their entire turn. Even finding pods wouldn't cause them to run for cover as they usually do when you find them.

While to be frank that's kinda nice in a weird way when I was just keen to find out what happens at the end, but I've just started Iron Man mode and even though it's a fresh game I still have the same bug.

Does anyone have any other info on this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> ...and that includes Harrison Ford presumably in a Solo flashback, there are two contexts I can see that happening.

1) As Luke discusses with Rey regarding Kylos origins at his academy, the film flashes back to those events and Solo is there with a young Ben.

2) Rey gets another force induced hallucination, where it's revealed or hinted at that she is in fact also Han and Leias daughter, meaning she and Ben are brothers, further compounding the family theme of the Star Wars saga?

Can anyone else put a different spin on this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember playing this game and really enjoying it although I never finished it and wondered if anyone knew of anything similar but more recent.

For those who don't know, its a Strategy/RPG hybrid where the player controls a team of mech pilots and their crews that help operate their mechs, in an alternate world war 2 setting.

Imagine the movie Fury, with mechs and you'll get the feel of the game's setting and mood.

Anyway, if anyone knows of something like it, or a sequel or something could you let me know?

Heres a video of a review so you can see the kind of game it was:

<TITLE> (Spoilers All) [Discussion] Robert Baratheons character is the most human story in ASOIAF </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-09-23 20:03:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I see people talk about Robert Baratheon and how he is a drunk lecherous idiot, but I see a man who has lost his sense of purpose. 

Imagine you loved a woman so deeply who was promised to you, you were prepared to go to war to get her back when she was 'kidnapped'. Read that again like this: you'd be prepared to start a *national civil war* to save her. He didn't grab his best friend Eddard Stark and a few men and go looking for her, he had the *entire country* backing his cause, at the expense of thousands of lives. 

Now imagine working out as this man that the woman you loved who you never got to see alive again was apparently in love with her captor and went willingly. You win the war, and the crown only to have the previous hand of the Kings daughter thrust onto you. At your wedding, you see your bride and wish it was your love. At court your wife speaks but you hear your dead loves voice. 

Robert Baratheon is a man who did everything to get what he wanted only to have it stolen (in his eyes) at the final hurdle with Lyannas death. Think about that for a moment. 

Would you really care if the wife you don't know hates you? Would you care if you beggared the crown anymore? Would you care about fathering untold bastards if you thought a night with a whore might take the pain away, even for just a moment?

You have everything a man could ever want except the person he wanted to share it with. 

Going back to Ned, Robert was supposedly his best friend. Seeing the temperament of Ned and his honourable moral compass do you think he'd associate with a drunken whoring oaf that would tarnish his own honour by association? This makes me think that Robert was an entirely different person when Lyanna was alive. 

I don't see Robert Baratheon as a drunk imbecile, I see a depressed man who has lost his purpose in life, and while his actions towards the end of his life were abhorrent to the outsiders eyes, they are at least somewhat understandable. At least to me. 

So /r/asoiaf, I think Robert is one of the most tragic human characters in the whole of ASOIAF. What do you think about him? Do you disagree?

<TITLE> Recording games via Steam? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I keep seeing such an increase on people recording games as they are playing etc, and while screenshots have been a mainstay of PC gaming for decades, I wonder why Steam has not got some kind of video recording system now available in it. It seems odd that both the current gen of cosoles have this seemingly basic feature, and Steam doesn't.

More and more often we are seeing people using Fraps and other utilities to record games, I just wondered if people would rather use an inbuilt video recorder in the Steam platform? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry folks I know tis is probably the wrong sub but I can't think of another that would be better to ask the question, but:

What's a good 32" 4k smart tv that's suitable for use as a monitor for 4k gaming?

I have a decent pc which I recently finished (thanks to you guys!) and want a single screen that I can hook up my PC to as well as my PS4 and XBoxOne. I understand that the LG 34UM95 is pretty good, but are there any other options that would be suitable?

If there is another sub that would be better suited to this question please let me know.

It was never released in Europe (UK at least) and I had to import a copy from the States and get my playstation chipped so I could play it, but it still to this day is my favorite Square RPG.

Seeing as we are getting a new FF7, does anyone think we might see a HD re-release? </TEXT>

Seeing as the show has seemingly spoiled that Stannis will lose the battle at winterfell, I think they might have something to do with the liberation of the Stark lands.

I just resubbed today from a lengthy break (I stopped just after The Den of Wolves was released) and was wondering if there is anything I need to know before jumping into Heavensward.

I know there was a housing update, but is there anything else I should know before jumping back in? Or even somewhere that shows a list of all the updates?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> ###Build Help/Ready:

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)**

Please answer here.

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

Primarily gaming, but I do some heavy photography too. Most gaming rigs should be able to handle some extensive photoshop too, so I don't think I need to specialize towards that.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**

1. Longevity/Upgradability
2. Oculus or similar capable

Of course like most I want the highest quality my budget allows for, but if I had to choose, i'm keener on effects as opposed to resolution. I am considering getting a 4K TV to hook it up to along with my Xboxone and PS4, so it'd be nice to exploit that with my PC if it's capable.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

I've been looking at PCs from Overclockers between 1500-2000, not dissimilar to: https://www.overclockers.co.uk/showproduct.php?prodid=FS-432-OE groupid=43 catid=2475 subcat=2487

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

England, UK

**Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please). [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp)**

Not sure how effeective these parts are, as it's been probably a decade since I built a PC last:

i7 4790K
16GB DDR4 @ 3kMhz
Nvidia GTX 980
500GB SSD -Gaming/Working photography storage
120GB SSD -Operating system
2TB HDD -Generic

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

Any help offered would be great in terms of actual components and where to buy from, and I havent got a clue what motherboard I should get :P

Thanks /r/buildapc! </TEXT>

Essentially the guy "finds" a huntsman spider (what on earth would eat the legs and not the spider) and over a few months feeds the spider and it grows its legs back after a molt! I'm very impressed this is even possible over such a short space of time, and thought you 'bro watchers would like to see them also:

<DATE> 2015-01-28 12:19:53 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Some of you younger truegamers may not remembner it, but Shareware was a word used for games that essentially had a 'try before you buy' mantra where a portion of the game was entirely free (like a demo) and you paid for the rest of the game. Doom for instance was probably the first game I remember playing with a shareware version, although i'm sure that the model is older than that.

In any case, the model disappeared a while back and it seems recently that it is kind of making a comeback if this article is correct:
http://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-investigating-free-to-start-console-games/1100-6424933/

I think that if you need to push *that* hard, you're lifting too heavy, but after showing some guys at my gym two of them were saying that he should be applauded for giving it 110%.

This can't be healthy surely?

I just accepted a bulletin board mission where it asked me to claim 4 bounties in the system. After cruising about for a bit I found an unidentified signal source which dropped me at an npc who said they'd make it worth my while to abandon the mission.  Being the noble soul I am I looked for a way to tell the npc to "stuff it" in the menus but there was no option for that, so I opened fire and killed the scum who was clearly a pirate by his communication log entries. When scanning him though he came up clean.

This netted me a 9200 credit bounty on my head which meant I needed a loan to pay it off when I died. 

What did I do wrong??? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just had a thought while looking at another thread about the Starks, but what if the Stark words literally mean a person called "Winter" is coming? As if prophesizing someone with the name "Winter"s arrival?

Bastards in the books assume their last names from the lands where they are from, so Snow, Stone, Woods, Rivers etc, so what if people from the Lands of Always Winter's bastards are called Winter?

<TEXT> Everyone is crying about what just happened with the Thunderstruck tree prices and the fall in Archeum costs. As I also understand it, fishing will be nerfed soon too.

All this will do is make the best way of attaining gold being long range trade runs. This will promote in game travel over teleporting (as people will have to carry packs), which in turn will create more pvp confrontations in the world. This also means global gold production will drop making the value of each gold piece rise.

While this is happening, seeing as Archeum is now farmable fairly cheaply compared to how it was two days ago, crafting materials will drop in cost reducing the amount of gold required for high end crafting of armour and weapons. This will not only cause more people to try crafting (increase in typical farm produce sales such as pelts) but will also make buying bought gear more attractive than just grinding Hasla for tokens.

The drawbacks to this is the small amount players that "cashed out" in the last few says will be super rich in a few months if they hold onto their gold, and the larger amount of people who thought they had 1000's of gold worth of items in their bank, but just had that price crash.

For me though, it is a small price to pay for increased world pvp encounters and proper trading, which is what attracted me to the game in the first place. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Howdy,

I notice there isn't *really* a tutorial of sorts showing you how the mechanics of the game work. The thing that bugged me about it was that there are these little power boxes where you can re-route power to other systems like speakers or air vents. I don't see how these work and don't recall anything explaining it in game, so perhaps we should make a thread about tactics and how you passed certain situations, not just with the alien? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Howdy peeps.

I bought into the hype early on somewhat mainly because the impression I got from Bungie was that this was going to be verging on an MMOFPS. 

You could go round, meet up with some randoms, do a few quests, move on and find another few people in the world and do some more quests. While in a way, it's true, it's also pretty difficult to do it.

I need to invite people to a group to interact with them. When I do that, it takes me back out into orbit where I then have to start anew and get back to where we were.

I haven't got that far in it yet to find out for myself, but apparently you can only do some of the harder content with people you have listed as Friends outside of the game. This will severely limit the amount of people playing those missions, as people will have to pre arrange to do those parts of the game, and not just be able to login and find people to play with.

Don't get me wrong, the game is a LOT of fun, it's just it went from being what I think could have been revolutionary and forge a new niche in the genre, into Borderlands with a Halo skin.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-08-22 13:29:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Howdy people,

I might be over reacting about this, but my gym group (not at my specific 'home' gym though) have introduced in many of their locations that there are designated 'womens' sections. In these sections only women may enter, yet there is no mens section where women can't go.

I would understand it if they had some new premesis that women could join as a "female only" gym, but is it discriminating against men that there are these sections for women with equipment that isn't in the rest of the gym where a man can use it?

EDIT: Just to make myself clear, I do think that women should have 'Women only' gyms, as it's a legitimate business and if you want to limit your client base thats down to the business owner. What i'm on about is a man and a woman paying the same fee to the gym, but not being able to use the same equipment. </TEXT>

Many times through my life I have felt like ending it, never more so than these last 12-18 months. Without going into details about *my* situation, has anyone else here thought about it but couldn't do it for the pain it would cause your loved ones?

Part of me feels that it would liberate my family and allow my wife time to find someone else who could support her better than I can, and find a suitable father figure for my daughter before she's too old. Then again though, I can't help but think what a selfish thing it would be for me to do.

<TEXT> A kinda pointless post, but just wanted to say thanks for all the great info and stories here.

My nephew who is nearly two has just been diagnosed with autism and not knowing much about it, and only having met a couple of people with it who have drastic cases, instantly thought the worst. Coming here, and reading peoples stories and experiences with it has completely changed my perspective on autism. So, thanks for not only educating me, but also making me feel that all is not lost for my nephew.

TL;DR: People in the uk clearly need to be educated about autism, because there are people like me who clearly have the wrong idea about it.

<TEXT> Howdy,

I played from release heavily up until WotlK, which I played through, albeit casually. My guild is long gone, but I still have all my toons on Bloodscalp EU.

I'm interested in playing on an RP server instead of a normal PVP one, and wanted to know if anyone can suggest/point me where I can find, a decent EU RPPVP realm if there still are any.

Also, how fundamental are the changes WoW has gone through these last 4 years or so?? </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Suggestion] Replacement for Zombies?? How about we remove humanoids altogether and research items? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-14 15:44:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The modern stuff is way, way too easily found imho. It's easy to kill a zombie (I can kill normal and black ones with just a rock) and for the best loot to drop from them just seems too easy. Not to mention that DayZ is zombie survival, and I like the tone of Rust because it isn't DayZ.

So, remove all the zombies, and add more animals. That should help with the newer players not getting food very easily. Then, have the best blueprints in locked 'safes' in random buildings (not just in rad towns) which can be opened with either explosives (but at 75% chance to destroy whats inside), or a safe cracking tool, which could be crafted with a new material, Medium Quality Metal, which would take maybe 20 low quality metal to make, and therefore make them valuable. Safes like this should be rare, maybe only having 1 spawned on the server at a time, and then if the print was for something like an M4, it should be split into parts such as "Blueprint: M4 Barrel", which you learn and make each piece. If items are rare and hard to make it' might encourage trading and bartering amongst players.

Low-fi items (pipe bombs, makeshift armours etc) should be able to be researched by players using a craftable 'research desk'. That could work by selecting the type of item you are trying to create (armour/gun/tool/melee weapon etc), then selecting the components you want to use in the research, one at a time in a step by step process. ie:

I want to try and make leather armour. 

So, step one of research, I want to click on type and select Armour.

Step Two: Choose base item. So i'd pick leather, and add maybe 5 pieces in.

Step Three: Choose Supplement. I'm going to need something to tie it all together, so lets add some thread (thread could be made from cloth). Lets add 10 pieces of thread.

Step Four: Choose Catalyst. I'm going to toughen that leather up. So lets throw some salt in there too. 20x of that added.


Step Five: Research. Hit the research button, and lets see what happens. it's a relatively small item, so could take maybe 30 seconds to research.

Step Six: Result. Ok, research failed to produce a new item. However, it would say something like this:

Research Failed. 

Was not large enough.
Was tight enough.
Was not tough enough.

This would give players an idea of what worked, what didn't and if enough of said resource was used to make an item (players should not know how much of something is needed to make an item, it should be discovered, and be different quantities for each player to a degree to prevent wiki's listing research quotas).

Well? What do you think? You could even have upgradable research desks (and workbenches) where you could add tools for recipes that need them. </TEXT>

He planted C4 twice on a wall, then shot me 3 times with a p250 (all three shots were fired in less than a second and all hit me even though I was a good distance away and strafing a lot.

So, I spawn in the bigger house i'm trying to build next door, and I hear his hatchet rapidly bashing my storage. Again, way way too fast for it to be regular swings. It almost sounded as fast as an uzi firing.

Anyone else come across this?? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Advice on stopping the snacking? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-08-28 11:42:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey fellow Loser-buddies (that sounds so great and so awful at the same time),

I started my journey about 10 months ago (October) at 157.6kg. I joined the gym, and then lost 12kg in around two months but after my wife had our first baby in January, i've not managed to lose anymore, only hover around the 145-147kg mark this last 5-6 months. I still go to the gym 3-4 times a week and have personal training once a week included in that, so it can only be the snacking thats stopping me lose weight.

It's awkward as I know my problem and I snack on the wrong stuff way too much, even though I eat really well most meal times (we eat home prepared an cooked food at home, never ready meals, and we eat out 1-2 times a week at proper restaurants, and never eat fast food.) 

What I want to know, is what can I do to stop myself from snacking? It's really annoying that I can go most of the day on just my meals, and then 10 minutes of binging and thats the day ruined :P

I'd appreciate any advice guys/gals </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey chaps/chapettes,

I started playing a week or two ago and am enjoying the game although I'm only running agent security missions and a little mining until I get a mining barge (to pay for PVP) properly. 

My question is am I going to need to wait a week or two until I'm skilled up enough to start flying cruisers or some other combat ship more capable than a frigate or destroyer? Or should I just head for low sec and get shot. A lot. 

I'm currently in amarr noob zones (Deepari and surrounding systems) and don't even know what direction to head out in when I'm ready to go :p

Oh another thing. When I make the transition from high to low sec and find where I want to head out to, should I sell everythingi have, buy a shuttle and then rebuy stuff when I get out there? I hear there are plenty of 'bubble traps' around 0.5/0.4 gates so beware shipping stuff through those.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi guys,

I was talking to someone about Quentin Tarantino wanting to quit film making due to the digital age, and was trying to explain to him why I think he felt that.

I'm a dSLR shooter, and have never shot film. Now i've been working as a photographer professionally for a while, I have a whole new appreciation for film shooters. If I under or over expose an image, I can fix that in post in a few seconds. However, as a film shooter that is going to be very difficult. Since realising this some time ago, I have a whole new appreciation for film shooters, and try to be triple sure I get the shot right in camera instead of thinking thats alright I can fix that later.

Whilst two shooters, one with film the other with digital can come up with the same finished image, it takes far more skill to get it right on film, and I can understand now why alot of film shooters rue people like me who shoot on dSLR's.

However, now things iike Instagram and the Lytro are happening, people with no training or experience can create decent images, and I now feel a bit like that towards those types of people. Whist tech cannot replace skill, it certainly makes a solid substitute.

TL;DR: art is art whatever process is used to make it, however, the older ways are more difficult and technology opens that field of people capable of making a good standard of art far wider. 

Anyway, how do you guys feel about tech and photography </TEXT>

I waited, I emailed apple, I emailed AMC asking them several times (never even got an answer, not so much as even acknowledging my question) and nobody can tell me why walking dead season 3 is available everywhere else in the world but not on uk iTunes. I've bought the previous two seasons and wanted the entire series saved to my iTunes library, and now that doesn't look like happening. 

So two questions. 

1, where can I see season 3? Anyone have any ideas? I'd prefer to buy it if I'm honest so if anyone know any online retailers I can download it from I'd be grateful. 

2, does anyone know what the problem is with home release in the UK for season 3? </TEXT>

(FYI the scene where you can point a gun or badger a guy in a ticket stall for a ticket, one option ends up with you getting stabbed in the hand, and Elizabeth applies a bandage which stays on your characters model for the rest of the game)

I see that some think that this Elizabeth isn't the same one we went through the game with, (makes sense seeing how remorseful she seems before she lets you go through the door to the baptism, and then how cold she is after), but doesn't that also mean that the Booker here isn't the same one we played as?

<TEXT> Hi guys!

Long time lurker to this subreddit, and thanks to everyone of you to helping me motivate myself to getting this bulk shifted.

About me:
I'm male, 6'3'', 32 years old, married and have one 2 month old kid. I weigh 148.9kg's / 327.5lbs today and need to get things under control. I've always had a weight problem and have tried lots of diets (atkins, cambridge etc) which usually work for the most part, but when I come off the diet I always put on weight after (eating pretty healthily) and then I lose faith and start eating the crap again, and I usually end up heavier than I started. 

I am a pretty broad guy too, so i'm lucky in so far that I don't look as heavy as I actually am, and that in turn should mean I will have less loose skin than I might have had if I'd be of a more slight frame. If I continue to gain weight I will more than likely need surgery to remove the excess skin, however my personal trainer assures me that provided I stick to the plan and keep it off for a few years, my skin will be almost like I'd never been (dare I say it) fat, save for the stretchmarks on my stomach.

I actually started this in November, but the birth of our first baby and a recent back injury kinda stopped my momentum. I was 154.6kgs then, got down to 144.4kgs and have increased (again mainly through eating crap and not being able to get to the gym due to baby/wife health worries - all fine now) to about halfway. Anyway:

My plan:
Work out at the gym 3 days a week, with an additional session with my personal trainer one day a week. I have a pretty active job anyway, and that coupled with walking the dog almost everyday I hope will be enough.

I also plan to NOT go "on" a diet (weight loss program like before) and instead change my diet (regular day to day eating habits). I don't care if it takes five times longer to get results, I'd lile to think i'm more likely to keep the weight off if I haven't got to "come off" a diet. I don't even want to keep a food diary this time, I want to try and keep it as "normal" and make as small of a deal of it as possible. I also found when I did that, i'd read though it and make myself hungry after :P

I have also set fitness goals. I intend to run Spartan Race in August, which considering where I started will be a feat. I still have 5 months to train for it, so I am confident I can complete the race provided I put in the effort before hand with both weight loss and fitness.

What I'd like from you guys:

If you have any tips at all about keeping the weight off after I get to a comfortable size, please let me know! Also, anything you can think of to help me lose the weight that wouldn't be common sense would be great.

Thanks in advance, and your stories have motivated me to make the change!

I've seen the first two seasons and have put off watching season 3 on the tv as I like to buy the episodes on iTunes and watch it down the gym while I bust out some cycling or cross training. 

The thing is, normally each episode is available as it airs on tv, but there is nothing for season 3 on uk iTunes. It is however available on the US and Australia stores.

Does anyone know why this is or know when it will come to the uk store? I asked apple and they said they didn't know.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Possible spoilers] What do people think of Jamie. Is he an ass or a good guy? </TITLE>

<TEXT> After reading several threads about season 3 and what people are looking forward to, a lot talk about being excited to see Jamie's story milestone at the end of the season, and I got the impression that people really hate him, yet warm to him after the events of ASOS. 

What do you guys think of him really?

I don't see him as that bad a guy, just he feels a bit miffed that people ridicule him for killing the king he was supposed to protect, when said king was making his people suffer. 

I think because of this he doesn't care what people think of him as he's already disliked by most, which leads him to act like a bit of a prat.

I just finished my first RPG. It's just a quick test of the software really so don't expect much, the whole thing doesn't last more than half hour or so, less if you're quick. The NSFW tag is used as theres a little swearing in it, and yes the girl with green hair is supposed to be annoying.

I just thought it was impressive that I put the whole thing together in a couple of hours, and that was it.

Let me know what you think, i'll start working on a full game soon! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Uk season 3 on iTunes?? </TITLE>

<TEXT> Hi guys,

I see that season three is available on iTunes in the USA but currently nothing is available in the UK even though its aired here. Anyone have any idea when it's coming?

I'd download it to my iPad and watch it in the gym and now I've finished season 2 I have to see who the guy with the sword is :p


Thanks </TEXT>

<TITLE> Grade of challenge for a 339lb man? </TITLE>

<TEXT> Hey guys!

I recently joined a gym, got a personal trainer and started on the long road to slimness. 

Now a couple months down the road and about 20lb down, my trainer is so impressed with the level of fitness increase he wants me to think about running in a spartan race with him. 

What I'd like to know is obviously there is some intense challenge there what what chance do I have of finishing one or all the three races? I live in the uk so the next one isn't until the middle of next year so I have about seven months to train for it, but what's the deal? Are you pitted against everyone else? Does it work like ironman where the goal is simply to finish in your own time? And most importantly, I'm on some medical steroids and will be for some time, I know that they inhibit weight loss, but will they be dangerous for that level of activity?

Thanks Spartans!

Ps, if I go and finish, I'll change my net name to subject1298 Prime haha! </TEXT>
