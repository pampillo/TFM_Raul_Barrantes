<TEXT> I am and know a few people who could have been registered Republicans in the 90s but now will never, ever vote for a Republican again after the past few years and especially the past few months.  If there are as many of us as I think there are, that could affect the first poll a bit.  

I'm not comfortable calling myself a Democrat because I'm not thrilled with them either, but centrists have lost a place at the table, and it increasingly feels like a choice between the old-style frustrating, corrupt and ineffectual politicians and the pants-on-headers.

I was never really comfortable with the dichotomy in the first place, if I'm being honest.  Especially now.  It punishes critical thought to actively participate in either group.  It feels like one has to believe all of the same things for all of the same reasons now in either group.  Screw that.

<TEXT> Sorry, I didn't mean to delete this. I'm awkward.  Posting it again from memory, not that it probably matters at this point.

Since DeVos came up nationally there's been a huge amount of shoddy reporting about my hometown seeing as her last name is all over the place here.  From some of the stuff I've read you'd think everyone here was a mindless robot with Amway stamped on our asses.  

I'm not sure why I'm defending them here, but Spectrum Health is the second or third largest hospital system in Michigan.  It's certainly *not* a "DeVos family business." DeVos isn't even in control over Spectrum. He's got an emeritus position on the board, that's it.  He's not the chairman like the article says.  I think he might've been at one point, but name a major hospital chain that doesn't have at least one local philanthro-fatcat on its board.

I'm not saying nothing's here, just that it's not a slam dunk like the article implies.

I want Trump gone yesterday along with everyone involved in this putrescent boil of an administration.  I really do.  But I think this one warrants caution.  Let's not forget that mischaracterizing things to make them more dramatic is one of the things that sent the other guys so far down the rabbit hole.

Yeah, we do.  [It's pretty...existent.]  (http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2015/09/is_this_grand_rapids_flag_one.html) We actually have two, but no one cares about the official one.

Urban Renewal, man.  Some might not know about this dark period in American history where dozens of US cities razed their downtowns in favor of "forward thinking" brutalist monstrosities and fields of useless concrete.  

During this time our city demolished [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=old+grand+rapids+city+hall source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ved=0ahUKEwiL4sSL9vfRAhWk24MKHUTTBZ4Q_AUICCgB biw=1366 bih=672), replaced it with a steel box and commissioned Alexander Calder to build [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Grande_Vitesse) to liven up the "plaza" in front of it.  

The Powers That Be were mighty proud of this purchase, and pretty soon our official city emblem was just the image of the Calder (we literally just call it the Calder now) in front of the Grand River, shown flowing free instead of blocked off behind walls of more concrete, with a big yellow circle ("the sun rising," because of course) behind it.

These days it's mostly referred to in some variation of Pac Man, as In "Bloody Sabertooth Pac Man" or "Walk of Shame Ms. Pac Man."   </TEXT>

For some bizarre reason we have a [Freddy's](https://freddysusa.com/menu/).  I am weirded out by them choosing GR first instead of starting out by you like literally everyone else does.

<TEXT> **If you're from the east side: Grand Rapids**

I'm going to see pushback for this, so I'll be a bit long-winded.

GR is a typical second city in that, if people in the larger metro think of it at all, they tend to think of it as backwards.  It's underrepresented in statewide media and it has a reputation for being exactly the wrong sort of Christian.  

We came by the reputation for conservatism honestly.  GR's main two cultural forces have both been white but insular--the Dutch Calvinists and Polish Catholics--who were still treating themselves as immigrant minorities decades after they eclipsed everything else.  It's not a good look, especially considering both groups were deeply religious.  

Things have become much more open and pluralistic around here.  Irrespective of whether that's a factor or *the* factor, there's a certain sense of momentum around here. Some are now calling it *overrated* because the locals are so outspoken about the positive change we've been experiencing.

I'm not going to go into the beer scene or whatnot, TL;DR: my entire life I wanted to leave GR for someplace bigger and more cosmopolitan, but the past 5-10 have made me rethink that.  Grand Rapids is, in fact, growing up.
___
**If you're from anywhere else in Michigan, and you aren't an ignorant idiot about Detroit: Kalamazoo**

Similarly to above, If Kazoo is on anyone's radar at all, it either seems to be typecast as another failed industrial town or as a place where wild college parties happen.

Ehh...yeah, both are still true to a degree, but it's also making huge inroads, and it's an awesome town steeped in history with a good local culture and some of the best beer (the artistic kind, not the beer pong kind) you'll find anywhere.  It's the only smaller-than-GR town that I'm familiar with in the entire US that I'd move to without hesitation.

_______
**If you're from out-of-state: Detroit**

You've probably heard both sides of this one *ad nauseam* by now.  Suffice it to say that you won't truly understand Detroit, or why it's so worth fighting for, until you spend some real quality time there. </TEXT>

A bit later he admits to not having seen any TNG, at which point Stewart invites him over to see a few eps and Nimoy calls him out gently on feeling sore that TNG existed in the first place while it was running, something he apparently got over since. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lot of people make the mistake of looking at healthcare policy (well, any policy) as a question of how it's going to affect them directly, as if they were not only one data point in (in our case) 320 million.  In your case, you're comparing your own costs with those of another middle class person in the US.  This doesn't work, because our system is way more expensive, before or after insurance, and everyone pays for things differently.  It's a classic question of forest vs trees.

The main point of comparison is actually how much money each potential patient is able to contribute to the system vs what they are able to take out.  Under our system, even after the ACA which was supposed to address this, healthcare costs are being inflated by poor people's inability to contribute to their healthcare costs, even as they are being bankrupted by it, which has an additional effect on our economy.  You don't have that problem (as much) in Canada.  

I'm not going to get into the vagaries of adapting your system to fit ours, but the above is one of the main drivers for looking at the positive points of a system like yours when looking to improve ours.

<TEXT> ^ This is your answer in a nutshell.  As a Michigander I hear a lot of people talking about Canadian policy in general as a source of ideas for improvement of American policy, mostly owing to the cultural and economic similarities between us (many Michiganders view Ontario practically as if it were another neighboring state, to give you an idea of what I'm talking about).

I work in the healthcare administration field, and the three systems I most often hear people saying we should emulate are Canada by a country mile, then Australia, then Germany. </TEXT>

In general, former frontier areas will have more weird names, and older areas will have more names from people or other places.   Sandwich, MA was named for Sandwich, Kent, but no one was thinking of their birthplace when they named Meat Mountain in Alaska (well, as far as we know).

* A personal favorite is [Lake Chaubunagungamaug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Chaubunagungamaug) in Massachusetts, sometimes stylized as Chargoggagoggmanchauggagoggchaubunagungamaugg.

* Someone already mentioned Hell, Michigan.  It's about 300 mi (483 km) from Paradise, Michigan, which itself is about 100 (161 km) from Christmas, MI, making Hell about 400 mi (644 km) from Christmas via Paradise (yes, things actually get that far apart in Michigan)

* I keep hearing people say Kalamazoo is a weird name.  I grew up too close to it to have an opinion.

* Walla Walla, WA is another funny-sounding one where enough people actually live that people might forget it's a bit off.

* Normal, Illinois, yet another of these, is aptly named for the most part, but still...

* I've heard there's a town in Washington named Humptulips.  I don't want to know.

* Canuck bonus (they also have many): Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha!, Quebec.

<TEXT> Not sure if I'm supposed to be the dipshit or if the author is (affirmative on the former, no idea on the latter), but:

I kinda felt like the gist (this is only my take, mind) of the author's point was a bit more nuanced than that.  Anyone is going to have preconceived notions.  Anyone is going to let their own personal standpoint/worldview/bias/banana preference influence their thinking.  This is a human thing.  I get that the whole coastal-elite-vs-"real murican" thing is a sore spot for a lot of people, but I do think there's a discussion to be had around the fact that we're allowing our media to consolidate to six or seven coastal cities where people don't have the in-the-trenches perspective that a local journalist would.  

It's not really Washington or New York's fault.  I live in the secondary region of my state, and I'm damned sick of statewide media completely forgetting my 1.5-million-person metro exists just because there's a 4-million-person metro a hundred miles away.  There are people in this very thread from KC complaining that this is a St. Louisan's perspective.  I see what the author is highlighting here as being a sign of the same thing writ large.

That said, there are stories to be told about the context that led to the riot after the incident, and the question I have is, if it's necessary, who will report on it?

Take [this article](http://www.citylab.com/crime/2016/08/half-of-wisconsins-black-neighborhoods-are-jails/495152/), for instance.

I reckon you've never been out of the extended D Metro. That's less than a third of the state.  And a good chunk of the Rust Belt looks like that, not just that part of Michigan.

[Flint doesn't have much more of a leaded pipe problem than any other large-ish city of age](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/sticker-shock-fixing-flints-lead-problem-hints-colossal/story?id=38869062). It was a horribly mishandled changeover in water sources (from Detroit's good water, mind) that created the crisis, not any uniqueness of Flint's infrastructure.

I get that you aren't being entirely serious, but as has been stated in this sub before, Flint is a sore spot when held up as an example of our state.  You don't hear me cracking about Florida Man. I know why *that's* unfair. 

Besides, I was merely pointing out how media coverage, etc. may color the perception of a place just as much for an out-of-stater as it would for a foreigner. </TEXT>

Define Ghetto.  Do you mean neighborhoods that look like something out of "The Wire?" Then yes, but the picture is more complex.

I'm writing this comment right now in a low-income neighborhood of GR (lower Creston for those in the know) with a lot of those markers (petty crime, vandalism, rich people don't come here), which is actually predominantly white.

Are you talking about slums and areas of high poverty? [Here is a tool from the Urban Institute](http://www.urban.org/urban-wire/poverty-race-and-place-map-your-metro) which actually maps poverty by race.  It's worth pointing out, though, that it focuses on the top ~60 metro areas whereas the [highest rates of white, and in fact *all* poverty](http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/rural-economy-population/rural-poverty-well-being/poverty-demographics.aspx) in the United States are found in rural areas. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not OP but Janeway's character was, in many people's eyes, handled poorly and people said the network squandered an opportunity for her to be a good role model by characterizing her inconsistently.  Part of this was because they brought in Seven for the sake of sex appeal, pushing Kes out, and shifted the focus of the ensemble.  It created a lot of BTS drama, especially between Mulgrew and Ryan. </TEXT>

<TEXT> According to Memory Alpha this puts the show's start in 2255.  Kirk started his five-year officer training in 2252 according to TOS "Shore Leave," making Lieutenant in '55 but not finishing the program until '57 according to "Obsession."  Could this have something to do with the officer training program / Starfleet Academy?  "Lt. Cmdr with caveats" sounds like she could be a cadet, but I think she might be over-ranked then.

It really feels to me like, failing that, it will be more of a Lower Decks series. </TEXT>

I don't believe in "bests" but Hideout (GR only?) has a hazelnut stout that is way better than it deserves to be.  I also second Expedition.  Bell's Kalamazoo stout is popular, but it's not my absolute favorite.  I am crazy about their cherry stout, but I'm not sure it's made anymore.

As far as stouts go, more will obviously become available as the weather chills.  If you're in any place with a plurality of local brewers, you're going to find a lot of hyperlocal variety in stouts, porters and scotches. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Huh.  It's important to note that the whole purpose of a formal IQ test is psychological, and every professional I know uses it for ADHD diagnoses.  

A normal or better score on the WAIS/WISC (most common IQ tests) rules out low IQ as the source of impairment, thereby indicating something more complicated is going on.  To put a more accurate point on it: the higher a person's IQ, the easier it is to put one's finger on a disorder.

This is part of the reason that some say ADHD correlates with high IQ, because a lot of people who have been formally diagnosed have also been administered the test and found to not be below-average.

This is so central to my concept of ADHD diagnosis and treatment that the idea that a psychologist/psychiatrist would rule out ADHD *because* of intelligence makes me wonder what that person is doing in the profession at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If anything, Michigan politics have shown a great amount of back-and-forth.  Michigan hasn't had a Democratic legislature and governor since the early days of the Reagan administration, and four of the last six governors have been Republicans (RRDRDR).  Flint's decline started during the tenure of the first of those six governors.

Edit: just to be clear, I'm not placing this at the feet of Republicans, I'm saying it's absurd to place it solely at the feet of *either* party. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hmm. 

Last time Michigan Democrats controlled both houses, Michael Jackson's *Thriller* was tearing up the charts. Granholm was only our second Democratic governor since 1961 (our last six were RRDRDR). I'd hardly call ours a Democratic run state for the balance of Flint's troubles.

Speaking as a Michigan voter, your part about a Republican bringing back manufacturing jobs was *exactly* what Snyder ran on. Things went downhill (not for the first time) under Engler, and Granholm talked the talk about making things better, but proved herself laughably misguided. That was he political climate that elected Snyder.  

We've now had three two-term governors in a row who started out being loved and ended being hated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Strategic supplies aren't necessarily for war.  Since the depression, a lot of them have been maintained for emergencies and humanitarian relief efforts both home and abroad.  They are also handy for keeping commodity prices low in times of trouble.  In this case, I believe we were maintaining it for the purpose of artificially deflating (yay!) the price of helium, so it would be cheaper to use it for research.  Also, the rocket part I mentioned is more NASA than DOD.

<TEXT> A phosphate was an old kind of pop (*cough* soda/coke/whatever) so named by [the method of making it fizzy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate_soda).  This was the kind served at soda fountains, as opposed to today's carbonic acid stuff.

I'm favorable to the idea that the full name is "soda-pop" and both usages are just contractions, and Coke is of course a [proprietary eponym](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/proprietary_eponym).  No harm done in using any of them.

<TEXT> We are talking right past each other.  I was arguing to expose the limitedness of *anyone's* experience, whereas you appear to be hung up on the idea that a well-traveled or simply European set of experiences should magically be exempt from any sense of humility in this matter.

Your initial argument, dialectically speaking, had nothing to do with the American educational system or media.  You stated that Europeans know more about us than we do them.  I never argued that point, I merely attempted to soften its clear subtext by pointing out there are good reasons for that.  You then implied that Americans were ignorant, using the European (for lack of a better moniker) operant definition of ignorance that I took issue with.

You retorted by flaunting your *bona fides*, apparently thinking them more relevant than they are, and countered my anecdote with one of your own, without knowing a single thing about where I've been or what I've learnt in my life.  So I tried to clarify my point in a friendly manner.

Twice you've pivoted to topics not at hand in my arguments: the state of the American media, and the state of the American Educational system, and now you are acting like that was the basis of the whole discussion. I also lack the willfully blind "MURICA"-ness that you are apparently attributing to me and my argument (I mean, no one else is around...). You're lighting straw men.

The *attitude* of unexamined "we know what learned is" is cultural imperialism, not the refusal to acknowledge the problems of our educational system, a refusal I *never came close to making.*  My reply to the assertion that the media is a mess was that it was all many of us have had access to until recently.  That is also not disagreement, but an attempt to make you see that it's arrogant to think that Americans should have drawn information from any other source.  I then attempted to head you off by pointing out that the Internet is too recent for our society to fully embrace its informative potential, and you argued that you'd never said that.  Not the point.


Please note that I went back and edited "saying the Internet..." to "thinking the Internet..." to better reflect my thought, which was merely to anticipate the response of, "but we live in an Information age," that I so frequently hear from people carrying the torch you hold.  You appear to have not gotten the point while affirming the reason I wrote that in the first place.  People don't change the patterns they're accustomed to that quickly.  It's not an American trait.

At any rate, I'm done here. You should know that your attitude, not the content of your position, is the reason why everyone else downvoted you.  Have a good day, and in the future please try to temper your European friends' opinions with the knowledge that they are just as flawed as us 'dumb' Americans. </TEXT>

<TEXT> it's not particularly useful at understanding entire populations of people.

Not in the way you apparently think I meant it, at least.  

I'm arguing the guy was ironically narrow-minded for judging me provincial because I didn't learn *his* language.  That's a human mistake, not a French or American one.

Your "honest criticism" is itself taken from a limited set of cultural experiences and assumes one culture should be learning the same things another does if it is to be "not ignorant / a dolt."  That's flat-out cultural imperialism.  And, more often than not, to be frank, it's offered as an insult, not friendly admonishment.

Learning a foreign language was used merely as an example here.  I think everyone should learn as many as possible.  That said, it's good for the skill set when you live 200 kilometers from where the language originated.  Not so much when the nearest foreign language starts being spoken over 2000 km away.

I live ~215 miles from Chicago and ~160 from Detroit.  I'm hearing news from both places *all the time* that I wouldn't expect someone in Paris to know about, but I'd be aghast if someone in Antwerp didn't know anything about what was happening in Paris. The scale of the person's locus of awareness is the same in either case.

Let's not forget that the American experience has until recently been limited to learning about goings-on from those sorts of media you are being so harsh about.  Thinking the Internet should have flipped a switch and changed that for everyone is presentism, and a higher standard than the one many in Europe are holding themselves to.

America is culturally, economically, and militarily dominant, for better or worse.  This means a people's exposure to American things will be disproportionate to the foreign things an American is exposed to.  America is also far enough away that one has to seek information out, even in this age, if one is to learn about things outside our borders.  That's just how things are right now.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> NH's main urban center is Boston.  Most of their population lives in relatively-well-off Boston suburbs. This skews their numbers.

New Hampshire is the [seventh state for millionaires per capita](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/20/these-states-have-the-highest-density-of-millionaires.html), at 6.8%.  Kentucky is third from the last at just under 4.25%.  That's a 60% difference.  New Hampshire has a *third* as many households as Kentucky, but only *half* as many rich households by this metric.  Thus I hope you don't mind if I extrapolate that the population density of rich people is *much* lower in Kentucky, which means that police, civil services and social services have a smaller tax base to pull from, irrespective of the politics of the area.  It also indicates that there is less money being made and spent per capita, which leads to a weaker economy.  This can be easily seen by looking at whether a company believes it can make money in an area.  Just an example: [Kentucky has eleven Targets](http://www.target.com/store-locator/find-stores?address=Lexington%20KY capabilities=), New Hampshire has [Nine](http://www.target.com/store-locator/find-stores?address=concord%20nh capabilities=), in a state less than a quarter the size by area with a third of Kentucky's population.


 nbsp;

New Hampshire [also has the lowest poverty rate of any state, while Kentucky comes in at 39th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_poverty_rate).  Kentucky's poverty rate is more than twice that of New Hampshire's.  There are [*eight times* as many impoverished people](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2014/demo/p60-251.pdf) in Kentucky as in New Hampshire.  

TL;DR: Actually, if we were just going on economics, there *is* that big of a difference.  In fact, Kentucky's doing pretty well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never disagreed with you that there are socioeconomic factors.

That's not *all* I said, though.  Sorry, the original person I replied to said murder rate and I didn't realize you were two different people.  I thought you were cherry picking my argument for the sake of a straw man. I'm getting in too many arguments here lately so I guess my hackles go up to quickly.  I apologize. :/

 nbsp;

You keep acting like this is a factor in gun crime, it isn't.

I didn't say population was a deciding factor, I said it was a *confounding* factor. I.E. A state with higher population indicates more urbanized areas, more demographic diversity, etc., whereas the bulk of NH's population density comes from the [Boston suburbs](http://www.nh.gov/oep/data-center/census/documents/census-populations.pdf) (PDF Warning).

Population density, IMHO, is not a good measurement in this instance because it doesn't take into account that the urban center associated with most of NH's population and density is in Massachusetts.  It would be like measuring Chicagoland's gun crime by the north end/suburbs instead of the south. Of *course* there's less need for Illinois' strict gun laws on the Gold Coast or in Winnetka.

Along those lines I'd argue that gun laws don't appear in a vacuum.  Laws, misguided or not, are pretty much always developed in reaction to a perceived need.  New Hampshire, under this model, would have fewer gun laws simply because they *have* fewer shootings, not the other way around. </TEXT>

New Hampshire is fifth among states by per capita income. South Carolina is 43rd and Kentucky is 45th.  You literally just picked the fifth richest state and compared it to two of the poorest.

New Hampshire is also a fraction of the size of either by both area and population. You'd be hard pressed to find a more disparate comparison on a demographic level, too.

~~I'm not much for accusations but your ignorance of the economic side of my earlier comment along with the choice of a different metric and state than the one I mentioned doesn't exactly look intellectually honest.~~ EDIT: I'm a moron who needs to look closer at his phone screen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> (I didn't downvote you but here's why I disagree)

My point was that people have more immediate access to know about us than we do about them.

I had a guy say something to me in French once.  When I told him I didn't understand, he said "typical American, never bothering to look outside his borders."

The question arises: When the hell would I use *French?*  I took seven years of Spanish, but then I had good reason: people actually *speak* that around here.

It's not willful ignorance. For most of us it's lack of exposure.  Indianapolis is the nearest state capitol that isn't my own.  It's about the same distance from me as London is from Paris.  They don't speak much French in Indy, so far as I know.  I'd have to drive *much* further than that to visit a place with a different language and culture.  Canada just doesn't count. </TEXT>

* Oregon/Idaho: I hit a rock again.

* Florida: IT WAS TOTALLY THE OTHER FUCKING GUYS FUCKING FAULT HOW FUCKING DARE HE ONLY FUCKING GO TEN FUCKING OVER IN FRONT OF ME. FUCK.

* Utah: I'm a great driver, I just forgot how to Freeway.

* SoCal again/Miami/Urban TX (note most of our business was in CA and TX): I ran daddy's expensive car up a pole. I was just going out for ice cream, honest.  Drag racing? How dare you!

* Minnesota/Dakotas/Wyoming/Nebraska: I hit another deer.  You shoulda seen that fucker fly.

* Connecticut: America's hit and run King.

* New Jersey: For a state that gets this much flak, you'd be surprised how mundane our accidents are.

* Kansas or Oklahoma: We measure our hailstones in fruit 'round here.  This one was a watermelon.

* (North) Texas or Oklahoma: My car's on top of the barn again.  It missed the target we painted after last time, though.

* Gulf Coast: See we was having this party and a fight broke out.  My car was parked right there.  It's totaled.

* El Paso: Car's gone.  Cartels took it.  Yeah, that was it.

Is Reddit *more* pro-American than other social outlets in your experience?  If so I'd have to ask if it's more pro-American because of all the Americans here as you hypothesize, or if it's just that there are more people accustomed to it here, warts and all, so there's less circlejerk (ugh).

I've spent between a week and six months in each of the following: Mexico, Cuba, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua.  I have a college degree in Spanish that focused heavily on Latin American culture, history and literature.  

The first thing that popped into my mind when I read your question was how the US government stuck its nose in where it didn't belong to split Panama off from you so they could build the canal.

I'm afraid that aside from knowing you were part of *Gran* Colombia, and that you have the Galapagos, there isn't much on my radar.

You haven't produced any authors of Garca Mrquez or Borges' quality that I can think of off the top of my head.  I can't think of a single Ecuadorean dish that isn't shared with someone else. I can't even think of an Ecuadorian telenovela or singer.

Maybe this is a good thing, though.  You wouldn't want to have the same kind of history with us that, say, Nicaragua had, right?

<TEXT> You don't have flair so I don't know which suburbs you speak of. I'm guessing you mean Chicago? The market I was talking about was the Schaumburg one near their library. 

I remember seeing trucks from out my way (Benton Harbor, Hudsonville, etc.) but the quality, selection and price were nowhere near as good as West Michigan.  

All of our farms have signs showing their location. There's very little produce from outside the area,  and I've never seen one from so far away as the quad cities. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The thing with the trucks and farmers is still the case here, except our participants usually set aside some stock to be sold at one of the (literally dozens of) markets in this side of the state.  

Then there are a few organic/specialty growers, bakers, jam makers, coffee roasters, et al, that really only (or at least primarily) sell stuff through these markets.  The stock is generally a bit more expensive if you go to one of the bigger markets, but the extra stuff gets sold on the cheap at farm stores or roadside stands out in the country.  Also, the big markets take and incentivize WIC.

Agritourism is huge out here, too. Usually those farm stores in the country are attached to apple barns and / or U-pick operations that will offer different kinds of produce depending on season. This is where you'll find the best savings. My wife and I got six quarts of cherries for ten bucks a few weeks ago. Now we're on to blueberries and raspberries. Peaches are next.

And I should say that I know that this is the case to a large extent all over the place. What I've been talking about is that the popularity and wide variety available mean many people simply don't buy produce from a grocery store at this time of year.  Haven't seen it in that magnitude anywhere else. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, look, Dutch jokes are a Michigan thing, too! The more you know.

Yes, Western Michigan is home to the largest concentration of people of Dutch descent outside the Netherlands.  This is a tightly-knit community that until surprisingly recently still had a first-or-second generation minority immigrant mentality.  The most common stereotype for these people is that they're cheap.  A big piece of that culture is Calvinism, which calls for a simple, non-materialistic life.  A lot of them have farming in their roots, too, and the depression mentality hasn't quite worn off.

I'm a seventh-generation member of this community and I'm one-sixteenth bohemian.  Think about that for a second.  Some part of my family's been in West Michigan for over *150 years* and I'm still 15/16 Frisian in descent.  This is part of the reason the community gets ragged on. </TEXT>

It's been growing for a few years now but back when I was in college (whippersnappers, all of you) it felt like I explained what a farmer's market was way too many times.  I tried to go to one in suburban Chicago last year and it was mostly expensive arts/crafts, soap, and the like.  Where was all the fruit?

I should probably point out this may be more of a West Michigan thing than an all-Michigan thing.  I had a coworker move from Saginaw who had no idea that Michigan grows strawberries.

<TEXT> Many others have made very good points, but I wanted to add that the US is so big that we also have tons of names from outside English, and many of those follow the same patterns.

We have [a lot of French names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_place_names_of_French_origin_in_the_United_States), especially here in Michigan--Detroit is named after its river, *le dtroit du lac ri,* "Lake Erie's strait".  Even Grand Rapids has a French name, both words just happen to be [cognates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognate) (Same with Lake Superior and dozens more).  

Other places have [Spanish names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_place_names_of_Spanish_origin_in_the_United_States), and every state has lots of [local native names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_place_names_in_the_United_States_of_Native_American_origin).  Chicago is famously a bad French pronunciation of a Miami-Illinois word meaning "wild onion," and Lake Michigan's name in Ojibwa is *mishigamaa*.

Then of course there's [Lake Chargoggagoggmanchauggagoggchaubunagungamaugg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Chaubunagungamaug).  On second thought, let's not go there.  It's a silly place. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [The CDC keeps track of this stuff pretty closely](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/access-to-health-care.htm).  Data from the [National Health Interview Survey](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db208.htm) shows that a lot of the assertions being made here are at least weaker than they seem when filtered through people's personal anger on the subject.

[Here's a report made for my state government](http://www.rockinst.org/ACA/states/Michigan/2014-12-Michigan_Baseline_Report.pdf) (PDF Warning) which calls it a mixed bag but does say it's helping people (then goes on to point out problems like yours) Look at section 4.1.

Finally, I work in a low-income health center.  I know this is basically anecdotal, too, but we have a ton of patients (I can think of at least 50) who were in critical health but are now on the mend because we were able to get them insurance and then see them.  These people were going to the ER 3-4 times a year, now they have a doctor.

And I'm not saying you would (how would I know?) but just in case: please don't go all "CDC has a bias" on me.  I've already been downvoted in this thread for linking to them.  It's their job to get this stuff right.  And I'll remind you Michigan has a Republican governor and legislature. </TEXT>

I'm sorry for your situation--I really am.  But you are not 300 million people.  You aren't qualified to say it's helping no one.

And FYI, the deductible and the fees you describe go to the doctor, not the insurance company.

<TEXT> Interesting.  Can't say as I've ever been accused of obfuscating my political leanings before.  Wouldn't be commenting so much in this thread if it were the case.

I went back and edited out a particularly bitter sounding part of my comment. I apologize for making it.

I think you need to take a step back and realize that this is far more than red team vs blue team.  Democrats and Republicans are not natural enemies, and most who say otherwise have something to gain from there being a fight.

As for me, I'm not some slithering snake come to whisper in your ear about the goodness of social programs.  What I am is someone who has to work with the ACA--both its good and bad parts--every day, so I'm plenty sick of all of the misinformation and bickering.  It makes my job that much harder.  It also makes the ACA's problems that much harder to fix.

Seriously, take a step back and look at how you sound.  Then go out and smell a flower or something.  This kind of vitriol isn't doing anyone, especially you, any good. </TEXT>

The consolidation and loss of smaller hospitals is a symptom of a larger and older problem the ACA is meant to allay, not one that was caused by it.  For instance, [hospitals in states that did not expand Medicaid are worse off in this measurement](http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/the-rural-hospital-closure-crisis-15-key-findings-and-trends.html) and ones in states that did are better off. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Michigan, Ohio, Indiana(?), Illinois, Wisconsin, probably Minnesota.  Chicago or Cleveland for our new capitol (tryna start a fight here).  MAYBE Missouri. Pennsylvania and New York are welcome to come too.  Well, at least Pittsburgh, Buffalo, Rochester and surrounding areas (Anything near the Lakes) are.

This is basically the "Rust Belt." Very similar culture, very similar mix of industry and agriculture.  I can also see a slight chance of Michigan, Wisconsin, northern New York and Minnesota joining Canada, Minnesota and Missouri joining the Plains states, and Indiana not wanting anything to do with its more liberal neighbors.

Missouri depends on Kansas City's vote. I think St. Louis would rather go with Illinois judging solely by my St. Louis aunt and uncle's views, but KC also has strong industrial ties to Detroit and Chicago.

Trash talking aside, the Southeast part of Michigan has way too much in common with Ohio to leave them behind.  We are also so close with Ontario that I can't rule out the possibility of us trying to join Canada.  I'm only guessing that could also be the case with the other areas.

If we're talking about parts of states (and we really should be), I have a hard time believing my part (West) of Michigan would want to economically separate from either Detroit or Chicago.  Forced to choose, though, it'd be Chicago all the way.  If states split, Northwest Indiana becomes part of Illinois for the same reason (it's already suburban Chicago).  Northwestern New York and Pittsburgh are Rust Belt areas, too.  Hard to say where  they'd go. </TEXT>

You call it recency bias to believe the above then say "there's a reason TOS was rebooted into films" as if that was some choice between TOS and several series that didn't exist yet when the wildly popular film series started, not a result of the popularity of movies that themselves were developed after a TV reboot (Phase II) failed to get off the ground.

The TOS movies had a better box office track record and better brand recognition.  These are the people who gave us *Into Darkness.* I seriously doubt they chose TOS because they wisely saw it was higher in quality.

<TEXT> Its common name is *Pomp and Circumstance*.  It's an excerpt, usually referred to as "Land of Hope and Glory," of the first march from a series of them which is named *The Pomp and Circumstance Marches*.  

The series is by British composer Edward Elgar.  The story goes that a professor at Yale was a friend of Elgar's, and he arranged for the piece to be played in his honor at a graduation at which Elgar accepted an honorary doctorate.  It became a tradition from there.

So TL;DR, they're actually the same piece.

---
EDIT: As for the second part, *America The Beautiful*, dude's talking up his sleeve.  Katherine Bates of Massachusetts wrote the poem that comprises the lyrics.  The most common music used for the song is the hymn, [*O Mother Dear, Jerusalem*](https://www.loc.gov/item/ihas.100010615/) by Samuel Ward of New Jersey.  Just because the tune has a similar meter to *Auld Lang Syne*, which is what I assume he's referring to, does not mean they are related in any way.

Both sets of lyrics are set in something called Common Meter.  It's worth noting that *Amazing Grace*, the Gilligan's Island theme song, *Advance Australia Fair* (Australia's national anthem), *The House of the Rising Sun*, *The Rains of Castamere*, and even the Pokemon theme song also use similar meter.  Just try singing the Pokemon song to the tune of America the Beautiful.  It actually works. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fuji, gala and red delicious aren't popular with consumers so much as they are with *growers and grocery stores*.  They are cheaper to grow, ship better, bruise less easily, look good on a shelf and keep well. They're big business apples.  The decline in popularity of the red delicious wasn't reacted to fast enough largely for those reasons.

Also, I'm mostly just doing some friendly ribbing (take a wild guess what the most grown cultivar is in Michigan), but I'd like to point out that the comment you replied to asserted that Michigan grows the *best* apples, not the ones Wal Mart and McDonald's are most likely to buy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Delicious):
In the 1980s, 'Red Delicious' represented three-quarters of the harvest in Washington state. A decade later, reliance on 'Red Delicious' had helped to push Washington state's apple industry "to the edge" of collapse.[5] In 2000, Congress approved and President Bill Clinton signed a bill to bail out the apple industry, after apple growers had lost $760 million since 1997.[6] By 2000, this cultivar made up less than one half of the Washington state output, and in 2003, the crop had shrunk to 37 percent of the state's harvest, which totaled 103 million boxes. Although Red Delicious still remained the single largest variety produced in the state in 2005, others were growing in popularity, notably the 'Fuji' and 'Gala' varieties.

Your apple industry almost collapsed because it got addicted to the Kim Kardashian of apples.  You've now swapped a good portion of that production effort for...Fuji and Gala.  Nice work there.  Let us know when you've learned how to grow an apple that tastes like something. :p

<TEXT> * Michigan was the first state to abolish the death penalty, making it the first English-speaking government body to do so.

* Michigan was the first state to put the establishment and maintenance of public libraries in its constitution.

* The Wal-Mart/Super Target -type department/grocery store was invented in Grand Rapids.  The first one was designed to be easily converted into a car dealership should the idea fail.

* In addition to having the second longest coastline in the US, Michigan has the longest freshwater coastline of any state or province in the world.

* Michigan has more lighthouses than any other state.

* Kellogg's and Post are in Battle Creek.  Breakfast cereal is basically a Michigan invention.

* We almost went to war with Ohio that one time over Toledo.  Congress gave us the UP instead.  Joke's on them; there was a ton of lumber and iron up there, and the largest commercial deposit of copper ever found is up there, too.


* Woodward Ave in Detroit was the first (concrete) paved road in the world (defined as more than one contiguous mile).

* Woodward, at the corner of Michigan, also sported the world's first four-way green/yellow/red stoplight.  It was invented by a DPD officer.

* MSU was the first higher learning establishment to teach agricultural science.

* The Detroit-Windsor tunnel is the first international car tunnel in the world.

* The first international *railroad* tunnel was built in Port Huron.

* Detroit was the first city to use telephone numbers.

* Our state police were the first to use a radio system.

* Vernors is the first soda pop made in the US.

* The total area of farmland in Michigan is half again as big as the entirety of Maryland, or roughly three times the size of Connecticut.  If it were a country, it would be slightly smaller than Swaziland and slightly larger than East Timor.

* Michigan is the second-most agriculturally diverse state.  We grow about 70% of all cherries produced in the US (which is the second largest producer of cherries, period, behind Turkey), and are first in production of beans, asparagus, blueberries, cucumbers, lowfat ice cream mix (don't know what this is but I keep hearing it), easter lilies, hanging flower baskets, impatiens, petunias, and geraniums.  We are second for apples, squash and carrots. 85% of this is grown in the western half of the lower peninsula.

* Grand Rapids was the first city to add fluoride to drinking water.

* If you are in Michigan, you are never more than six miles from a body of water.

<TEXT> The affiliates aren't necessarily as closely linked to the networks as they are to the companies that own them.  For instance, our local Fox affiliate is owned by Tribune Media (WGN).  It's nothing like Fox News, but pretty frequently shares news content with its parent.

I know it seems off topic, but I thought I'd point it out as the station's news department is based on its parent independent station in all but branding and the "affiliate" part only means that it buys primetime programming from the network. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So get this: 

Grand Rapids and Flint were both officially settled roughly around 1820 (this is not including native villages), but GR hit the industrial revolution just right with its furniture industry and grew much faster at first.  Grand Rapids passed a hundred thousand people sometime just after the turn of the 20th century.  At this time Flint only had 13,000 people.  

By 1960, Grand Rapids had experienced some pretty good population growth considering it had lost the industry that put it on the map, and was up to 177,000 people.  Flint had roughly 200,000 and had taken over as the second largest city in Michigan at this point.  

Poor Flint started losing people in the late sixties. This turned to a flood in the seventies and never stopped.  Flint dropped behind the capitol, Ann Arbor and two Detroit suburbs (Warren and Sterling Heights), and is now seventh largest in the state.  

It was estimated that Flint dropped below 100K last year.  At this rate it is entirely possible that Wyoming, Grand Rapids' most populous suburb (which is growing like the weed that it is), will have a larger population than Flint by 2025.

In other words, in sixty years Flint grew by more than the entire 1960 population of Grand Rapids, and will have lost more than half of that growth in the sixty after that.  It's now on track to be passed by a suburb of the city it once eclipsed.

I, for one, do not welcome a world where Wyoming is larger than Flint. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Counterpoint: 

* "Plan 9 From Outer Space" for an example of film that "echoes through time" precisely because it sucked.

* Saturday morning cartoons for an example of media that merely coast through the public consciousness retaining goodwill through pure nostalgia.

I'd argue that the assertion, "something which resonated with a portion of the public across a protracted period = can't be something bad" is based on an *ad populum*.

I, for one, am on the "why did people even like this" wagon for "Clerks", fwiw.  I found it puerile, did not relate with it one bit, and couldn't stand the characters.  If sucking is a subjective quality then not sucking can be too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is definitely an old possibly-industrial wheel or mill of some kind. Judging by the quality of the wood and the lack of wear I wonder if it was made to be mostly ornamental, or at least for something soft...as mentioned before, like flour.  Shot in the dark, but MC 21676 could be the craftsman's initials and the date of of creation.

The side of the small part in picture seven probably fit into the larger part, and there is evidence of wear from a now-missing grind plate that fit into the part shown in the first and second-to-last pictures.  the side of the small part shown in picture eight looks a lot like an old industrial wheel, so it probably hooked up to some sort of machinery on that side or had something else attached to it.

Edit: On second thought, I wonder if these pieces were part of the same machine or if they were just bought and refurbed together.  Do they fit together? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It might have something to do with the fact that they opened their donut shop down the street from a bunch of homeless shelters in the first place.  

They moved into an area where a problem has existed for decades, then blamed the problem for their closure.  It's not the homeless people's fault that the area didn't gentrify as fast as the owner wanted, and it's not like they have anyplace better to go.

I would also argue that they are exaggerating the problem.  I'm not saying it isn't bad, but it's certainly not Times Square in the 70s bad like they make it sound.  It's not even as bad as it was 20 years ago.

Propaganda lost a founding partner awhile ago, the brains of the operation, who was replaced by the daughter of the building owner (the other partner).  Some said he was pushed out by the owner, but that's neither here nor there.  The quality of the donuts has declined quite a bit, but they are still grossly overpriced (literally 4x) compared to the local competition.  The store has also been open less and less of late.  Clearly something else was wrong.

Said building owner is currently trying to keep one of the shelters from expanding nearby.  It really, really looks like he's trying to use the business' failure as political leverage by blaming the homeless people.

<TEXT> I have a second-standard-deviation IQ and second-standard-deviation ADHD (there's no bell curve for ADHD severity but shaddup, I'm making a point here). It's not a good mix.  

Imagine dropping a 400hp V8 into a rusted-out Ford Festiva.  Doesn't work, right? You've got great potential power but no way to safely apply it to pavement.  That's my brain.  Sometimes I think it's worse that I'm smart because I can't escape a deep understanding of exactly how broken I am.

I struggled academically, even with good help.  I had a compulsive need for more knowledge (still do), but school often felt specifically designed to thwart me. I spent a lot of free time teaching myself things I missed in class.  I spent much more disappointing my teachers and trying to make up for it.

I had emotion control issues and was never any good socially, and never had any friends.  I went to a school with mostly richer kids who took every opportunity to make me feel lesser-than.  It got to the point where I would stay in during recess to avoid the other kids.  I was a full-blown misanthrope before I even knew what the word meant.

I don't recall exactly how it was that we ended up tuning into our CBS affiliate one Saturday night, but the episode was a rerun of "The Measure of A Man."  Here we had an entertaining show that was also smart on several levels, presented in a whole-cloth representation of everything I wished the universe could be.  Optimism and hope just oozed out of the thing.  We also had an emotionally stunted outsider as the hero of the story--being defended fiercely by his friends, to boot.

I took it on myself to learn everything about Trek.  I set the VCR to record it whenever it was on, whether I'd seen that episode or not.  I practically memorized the Star Trek Encyclopedia when it came out.  There was a point where I had read every TNG novel (and most of the TOS ones) and companion book in publication.  I'm rusty, but I can still usually get the season and episode title just from the first few minutes of an episode.  I lived and breathed Star Trek.  I didn't know it at the time, but it also gave me an intellectual outlet that helped me handle school, as I could use it to escape the stress,  process the world my way, and rethink things.

I don't consider it too dramatic to say that Star Trek saved my childhood.

Several years on, I still had some trouble with social skills. I was 24 and I'd never kissed a girl.  I did have friends, though, and all of them were Trekkies.  They pushed me to put up a profile on OKCupid.  Someone responded, and we started dating.  Knowing the stereotypes around Trek, I waited awhile before mentioning my love for Star Trek.  Turns out she owned Spock ears and had built a model of the Enterprise D.  She'd had a rough childhood (early divorce, alcoholic father) but had also found solace in the Star Trek universe.  I'm going to avoid being sappy, but we've been married almost seven years and have a four-year-old Trekkie.  I never thought I'd be here.

TL;DR Special needs kid.  Star Trek was my only friend, and one of the things that brought me together with my wife. </TEXT>

I remember being concerned about how hot my friend's new smaller one was compared to mine.  I also found [this post](http://psx-scene.com/forums/f20/best-ps2-version-62714/) of people taking the question very seriously indeed.

That said, early PS2s had DVD problems, but other than that they're all pretty solid.  Nothing to worry about on an X360 level. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Has anyone spoken with the mods of /r/offmychest to see what their rationale is?  OP, I've been banned by a bot before but a calm note to the mods overturned it without fuss.

Also, I have to point out that guilt by association is a valid means of policing a subreddits when another subreddit has a well-established history of leaking trolls if not outright brigading.  As a website administrator,  sometimes I have to block entire foreign ISPs to stop people from attacking it or otherwise injecting inappropriate content. This is the same thing.  It might be extreme but it might also be easily seen as necessary.

EDIT: I also find it important to point out that *your right to free speech does not extend beyond action of the government*.  You can't be jailed for it.  Individual people can still ostracize you for it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the US we usually have states divided up into counties or parishes (same thing, different terminology), then each of those is divided into townships (again, terminology may vary), and addresses are counted off in numbers (roughly analogous to Cartesian coordinates) from an arbitrary point within the most populous township or the middle of the county seat (capitol).  These numbers rise all the way out to the county line.  Counties can be big, and this point is almost never dead center, so the numbers can get pretty high. 

Exceptions are sometimes made in more aged areas for addresses that predated this system, but it's more common that some time ago the local government actually changed the numbers on buildings to better fit this system.  This still happens from time to time.

In Kent County, MI, where I live, Grand Rapids is the county seat.  This city is divided into quadrants (NE,SE,SW,NW) by a North-South baseline road (Fulton St) and an East-West one (Division Ave) with 0,0 for the county being the intersection of both (even though this is in the corner of the county).  In addition to this, nearly every street in GR is platted as "something Avenue" of it runs north-south and "something Street" if it's east-west (some exceptions being made for old Ottawa tribe roads).

After that each 100 addresses is 3/5ths of a mile from the previous, with the address of the house being its distance in 1/800s (math?) of a mile from the baseline road most perpendicular to that street.  Because of this our blocks (and numbered streets) are actually numbered in 800s, not 1000s.  For example, 28th street (technically 28th St SE or SW depending on which side of Division Ave you're on) is a major road here, and itsname name designates it as baseline 28 or 2800 south.

<TEXT> Sorry, this is for both PC and console, it is applied to both.

I was referring to the thread generated by my top-level comment.

Yes it comes off snobbish

There are dozens of ways to approach this without doing so.  I actually considered mentioning PCs in my original comment, but didn't because I feel like I shouldn't have to justify not having a roided-out PC (Edit: FWIW, current machine is a Haswell i7 laptop without a dedicated card.  It'll run Borderlands 2 on max, but not happily) nearly every time I mention owning a console around here.  So far that is not an exaggeration--it really has been nearly every time.  Personal preference be damned, that is super annoying.

<TEXT> You are asking this question in a thread about a game that is being released on consoles.  In this context, can you see how it would be interpreted as snobbish to suggest someone just buy a PC when no one asked a question even tangentially related to that? 

Do you have any idea how many times people have replied to me with some iteration of "just buy a PC?" It's not that simple of an equation. I didn't ask anyone's opinion on what machine to get (what in the hell do these people think I'm typing this on?), but there it is being shoved in my face AGAIN.  It's frustrating.

When I went into Gamestop many years ago to pick up a PS2, I had to fend off the manager--THE MANAGER--trying to convince me that I shouldn't bother because the original Xbox was soooooo much better and you got to play Halo.  This is the same exact thing.  Dude didn't know a thing about me or my gaming preferences. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You might be surprised to hear that I agree with you.  Might be even more surprised to learn I'm approaching 500 games in my Steam library.  

The main reason I'm even getting the Xbox is for exclusive games (Forza and Ori, which I can't run on my laptop).  That said, you are probably running Windows, and might've only had the choice to buy one of your games on Origin or Steam.  Exclusivity isn't just a console thing.

That doesn't mean I'm not sick to death of hearing people act like buying a PC is some kind of obvious choice I must've overlooked while stumbling from my one brain cell to the other.  I'm sorry if I opened up on you too quickly there, but you aren't the first person to point this out to me and I am REALLY sick of the PCMR snobbery I see around Reddit.  I just wanna play some games after work. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nothing in your comment does anything to address whether the statement on the sign is correct or holds theological water.  You're doing mental jumping jacks to keep a certain modern worldview attached to your Christianity that has very little to do with it.

Put simply, being homosexual is less of a barrier to being a good Christian than a lot of things the developed world takes for granted on a daily basis, but we don't like to look too closely at the inequality, the injustice, the poverty, or our own complicity in these things, do we? So we blame the "other."

Homosexuality has absolutely nothing to do with the core principles of Christianity.  It's a wedge issue, a fire stoked by politicians who wanted to make a fast point in the polls on the backs of people's hate and fear.  And you're letting them do it.

Christ wanted us to love one another above everything save our love for God.  He wanted us to take the plank out of our eye before addressing the sawdust in our brother's.  He wanted us to turn the other cheek when we are wronged.  He wanted us to give towards the goal of a restored world until it hurt, then keep giving.  That is the core of Christian principles.  You have to know that somewhere deep inside.

So cut it out.  You know that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.  You are no exception.  This whole silly issue is the work of the devil, and he's doing a fine job of distracting you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Before I write this long thing that maybe no one will read, I want you to know that I'm a lapsed Christian who grew up in a very religious household which put a lot of emphasis on good theological thought.  I'm not a pro at this, and I don't take all of it without at least a bit of skepticism.

I think the concept of sin is a really misunderstood one.  At least in the denomination I was raised in, sin is an outcropping of how broken we are.  When we talk about a cheesecake being sinful, it's getting closer to this concept, because what we are saying is that we know we are doing wrong by ourselves.

Think of sin as being anything that separates us from an ideal state of godliness, what's good for us according to God.  This ideal state, as repeated over and over in the bible, includes a happy, close marriage that produces well-adjusted children.  I'm not saying I endorse this viewpoint, but you can certainly see that being the case in the first century AD, no? The concept of homosexuality precludes the happy marriage above, at least in the mind of someone writing within a few hundred years of Jesus.

Anyway, sin encompasses all of the things that make us lesser than this ideal. Everything that brings us away from God is sin or the result of it.  It's an unfortunate result of a broken world which is best avoided, both for our sakes and our children's, not some cosmic balance sheet.

And that's where we get to another thing: it's important to also realize that not all lines of Christianity read the Bible with our intellectual hands tied.  Mine taught us to understand the historical viewpoints and biases that may have filtered to the paper through the hands that God chose to write his word.  

It creates a situation where learning to read the text with an educated eye is absolutely crucial, and therein lies the biggest problem in the study of the bible.  The upside of this is that if something gets repeated thematically over and over, turned over and ruminated on by multiple authors, then it's pretty safe to say that it was a major point that God was trying to get across.

So, what's perhaps the biggest one of these points in the new testament? Something repeated over and over again, quoted by Jesus in multiple sources, and discussed ad nauseam? You got it:  We are supposed to be good to each other, especially when it hurts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He was overreaching a bit with "equals."  The bible is basically saying that wishing someone dead isn't necessarily better than killing them, not that the two are equal.  Christians and non-Christians alike (especially Catholics, the Protestants would say) have had quite a bit of trouble with the idea of sin as a demerit.  It's more an expression of how broken we are.  It's like a Heroin addiction.  Is the person really to blame? Perhaps not, but it isn't helping them live a healthy life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lapsed Calvinist here.  It's because being a Christian isn't about not sinning.  We're taught that we all sin, and it's only through God's grace we are redeemed, and because we *are* redeemed we're supposed to pay it back through loving and helping those around us.  

One of them is an example of how we fall short of God's standards, but that's okay as long as we try to better ourselves.  The other is an example of acting contrary to the very word Christian--which means "little Christ," i.e. someone who seeks to be like him. </TEXT>

Not saying he should have jumped to correct OP though. What OP said is exactly correct in the States, too (well, in most of them).

BTW: do you not see the irony in looking down your nose at the guy above you by calling him an American, associating that with arrogance and jumping to conclusions, without yourself knowing his country of origin? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Liability by definition is the state of being legally responsible for something, and *all* insurance is liability insurance in some form.

 If your tree falls on the neighbors' house, your homeowners insurance covers it, because their job is to allay the risk of legal (monetary) responsibility from something like that happening.

This is the case even with medical insurance, which covers your debt to the doctor, thereby eliminating your legal responsibility.

Lawsuits are not supposed to punish by default. Their purpose is to allow the plaintiff to recover reimbursement for damages from the person who caused them. Insurance is doing what it's supposed to do if it gets involved in that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pricing isn't based on when it's "right" to lower the cost of a game.  A company bases the price of an older game on several factors, but overall it's a question of maximizing profit.  If the company believes they will continue to see acceptable sales rates at $30, why drop it to $10?  The real problem here is the number of people who still go out and buy the new one at $60, thereby emboldening them to believe they have a "premium" product.

Like many other people I've skipped over Nintendo this generation, so I don't have recent experience, but from Wii on back, first-party Nintendo games hardly ever dropped below $20.  This is because Ninty knows people will pay a premium price for Nintendo polish. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I keep scratching my head wondering where all of this extra tax money you keep mentioning is going to come from. You do realize that the very word "nonprofit" implies that all of an organization's surplus revenue goes right back into the cause, right? 

Sure, some people are overpaid (not nearly so in comparison to a similar job in the private sector, by the way), but I think you'll find the actual surplus across all organizations isn't nearly as much as you think. My executive director is a better example of someone at the helm of one of these groups than the head of the Red Cross is. Again, I'm afraid you're letting a few dramatic examples overshadow a chorus of more sensible ones. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Income percentages as a measure of a nonprofit's useful-to-evil ratio is one of Reddit's favorite chestnuts.

We're a doctor's office, so our administrative costs are incredibly high because of licensing, insurance, etc.  That doesn't mean we're less effective than a food pantry and our finances shouldn't be held to the same standard.

Moreover, the internal mechanisms of any organizations are far too complicated to reduce to a simple pie chart. It may surprise you to learn that, for instance, the majority of our funding for cancer testing and prevention comes from Susan G Komen's literally-hitler "awareness" effort.

Oh, and anyone who thinks we aren't already subject to lots of scrutiny from the government is out of their minds.  We're submitting to an external audit right now, in fact. It's something we do every year under Michigan law. No biggie, part of doing business. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a low income clinic, we are strongly in favor of anything that helps us fulfill our mission. Obamacare isn't perfect but it's truly stunning how helpful it's been for our patients.  We don't support political or religious organizations, but you'd better believe the governor got an earful from us and others when he dragged his feet on keeping our state's Medicaid expansion.

That is technically lobbying. I think maybe you're hung up on the idea that it's always a bad thing, but it's not. As a group working day after day in direct contact with these people, we have a duty to speak up for them when we have the opportunity and we know they will be left behind without our help.

The thing is, no lobbyist is going to tell you different. They all feel like the government needs to hear their side of their pet topic. Black and white has nothing to do with this. It's nowhere near simple enough to reduce it to that.

Edit: also, "render unto Caesar" means you should submit to the authority of  Government and to God in their own respective deserved ways. The whole thing with the taxes was only the example Jesus used to get his point across (the coin is Caesar's, made in his image, so if he's owed it he should get it. Mankind has God's image, so...) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I work at a 501(c)(3).  We are a small (20 employees) private primary care clinic that seeks to provide high-quality medical care to those who can't afford it.  In doing so we serve the public good by keeping these people from entering the hospital, via ER, without a way to pay.  
We help people sign up for insurance if they don't have it. We teach them how to take care of themselves.  We work in the community to try to keep our neighbors from being ruined by their medical bills. 
We also seek to be a doctor's office...you know, like the one you have...instead of one of those dingy free clinics with the bullet proof window between you and the receptionist.  You'd be surprised how big of a deal that is.

Trust me, we do this for peanuts.  Our Executive Director drives a ten-year-old Sentra and makes less each year than my wife, even though both are RNs.

Would you really throw us out with the bathwater?

<TEXT> Oh really, don't get me started.

I think a lot of the other posters explained this very well, but here goes.

My other comment in this same thread:
 Speaking as a former auto adjuster, Los Angeles is the only place in the entire country where people act like it's understandable that they got in a multi-car pileup because it started to *drizzle*.

 I once had the singular experience of driving from Indiana to O'Hare during rush hour, getting on a plane to LAX, then driving from LAX to Tujunga...during rush hour. Chicago drivers: I may not always like you, but I respect many of you. LA drivers: Fuck every last one of you.

 The food scene really is pathetic. I'd put Grand Rapids' food scene above LA's. I'm not saying this lightly; I really would. You know you're in for a great time when a freaking fast food place is at the top of that many travel "must eat" lists. And you know what? In-n-Out isn't actually that good. There, I said it.

Also: 

* How did they let traffic get that bad, and then worse? Don't they remember what mass transit looks like?  EDIT: Actually I have an answer to this, in the actual words of an actual Angelino: "Eeew... only, like, *poor* people take the bus!"
* How is it possible that the most cynical, stereotypical portrayals of Hollywood types I've seen in mass media somehow fell short of the mark?    
* EVEN THE FREAKING PALM TREES AREN'T GENUINE ^((they're imported from Florida)^)
* Hollywood itself is one of the most abrupt cases of expectation vs reality I've ever seen.  It's somehow both pretentious and slummy.
* Seriously, where's the good food?
* The air is third-world quality.  I've lived in Tegucigalpa and spent a good bit of time in Mexico City. I know third-world quality.
* Tell me where the urban planner touched you, LA.
* One of my least favorite places on earth is the never-ending, culture-free, soul-choking, concrete-worshiping sprawl around Detroit.  Take that, supersize it and add palm trees and self-absorbed people.  BAM, you've described most of the Basin.

<TEXT> Speaking as a former auto adjuster, Los Angeles is the only place in the entire country where people act like it's understandable that they got in a multi-car pileup because it started to *drizzle*.

I once had the singular experience of driving from Indiana to O'Hare during rush hour, getting on a plane to LAX, then driving from LAX to Tujunga...during rush hour. Chicago drivers: I may not always like you, but I respect many of you.  LA drivers: Fuck every last one of you.

The food scene really is pathetic.  I'd put Grand Rapids' food scene above LA's.  I'm not saying this lightly; I really would.  You know you're in for a great time when a freaking fast food place is at the top of that many travel "must eat" lists. And you know what? In-n-Out *isn't actually that good.* There, I said it.

<TEXT> Usually nonjudgmental Midwesterner here. I've spent over a week in each of the top six US cities by population.  TBH Philly was my least favorite one until I visited LA.  

Seriously, one week in LA and it took a backseat to a town that smells like dog piss four months of the year. I tried to like LA, I really did, but fuck everything about that place.

...Except the Queen Mary and Magic Mountain, but do those even count?

Sincerely, someone who lives within a day's drive of ***DETROIT***, and who has an UP-sized chip on his shoulder against the D Metro, but would still chose it over L.A.

<TEXT> Actually it's spot on. Look at the top few comments--they all reject the question out of hand. It's not an unamerican question in the sense of us finding the question odious. It's because, to our ears, it's a bit like asking which drop of a lake is the lakiest. Our motto is *e pluribus unum*--out of many, one. The idea that one state would be more American than others goes against our very concept of what makes the States United in the first place: that they represent, at least ideally, a pluralistic unity of diverse interests. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I literally had zero opinion, good or bad, of Mormons until I spent two weeks in SLC with a family of them, and TBH it was hard to not let myself come away with a negative opinion.

The wife of the family was an old friend of my wife, and we were out there to visit them. I'd never met this family before, but they were our age and we spent some time in their social circles. We talked a lot about our respective religious backgrounds (I was brought up in a very conservative Calvinist community), and they felt welcome to do more than their share of proselytizing, both of their religion and of their Fox News-infused world views.

The way the family and others around them acted, while simultaneously being very nice to us and clearly good people overall, reminded me of the worst members of a community I'd turned my back on: nice, generous, but possessing a dangerous mix of being closed-minded, cloistered and way too self-assured. Exhibiting a passive aggressive boastfulness about their lives while acting as if different ways of life were obviously inferior, and anyone who dissented was simply, exasperatingly wrong. Completely unaware that certain tenets of their religion or culture, presented bluntly and as fact, could be taken as deeply offensive or even personally insulting by outsiders.  Way too eager to act as if any negative interaction they had with outsiders was more evidence of a concerted campaign of oppression against God's own chosen people--a people who, to a man, should be held completely blameless in any conflict, no matter what the cause.

Full disclaimer: the above applied pretty directly to me in high school. I know it's not exclusive to the LDS Church. That said, as a person who knows he hurt people back then, who has worked hard to grow away from it (here I feel like I'm patting myself on the back too much, if so I apologize), it was very frustrating to see those behaviors from grown people my age on that scale.  It's easy for me to see how someone could get a very negative image of LDS people if their interactions had been anything like mine.

TL;DR I don't begrudge people their anti-Mormon sentiment, even though I can see they are largely good people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Westsider here.  I feel like that was reductionist and insulting.  

I know a lot of people who feel like the Detroit area has too much influence and people there are too dismissive of us and too happy to let GR/Kzoo/Muskegon be ignored and left out in the cold.  I also know a bunch who feel like (suburban) Detroiters are culturally very different and "weird" (i.e. selfish, materialistic, complicit in urban sprawl and inequality, willing zombies in "what's wrong with America," whatever that means), and blame Detroit and Flint for letting what happened to them slide (I'm talking about things like the white flight, corporate greed, and a relative lack of philanthropy) and taking us into the mud with them.

**I'm not saying all or any of this is correct,** (*I edited this just to bold it--I don't buy a lot of it, but I wrote it to illustrate things I hear that have nothing to do with the racism of the speaker*) but there is some smoke to support the idea of a fire.  EMU gets better funding than GVSU, for instance, and there's a lot of grumbling over how that shouldn't be so.  I also know people who question why the freeway to Saginaw is "nicer" than the one going through downtown GR.  Little things, yes, but they're there.  And yes, I myself feel like a Canadian having to explain he's not an American to outsiders sometimes--no I don't live near any urban ruins, no people don't randomly shoot others around here, stop asking.

Then there's the fact that people apparently think we're all racist/hick/bible thumpers/teapartiers whatever over here.  We know we have a rep. We know how people talk about us and we don't like it.

But how is this different than anywhere else? It's not uncommon for there to be stereotypes and animosity between the larger and not-so-larger parts of any state.

And for the record, I was shocked at the casual racism--directed towards Detroit, no less--I saw in Clinton Township the first time I visited. I'd never seen anything on that level in Grand Rapids.  Not saying racism isn't a problem here, just that I was shocked, and it happened there, not here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's been awhile and it turns out the storyboard artists get a lot more credit than I thought, but here's a few points:

* Po originally lived with his mom and had a mean boss who was a goose.
* Tigress was originally going to be the chosen one and Po was going to land on her causing a sitcom-y mistaken identity thingy.

* Po's original characterization was much more abrasive and less self-aware. The change was credited to Jack Black, though.
* Apparently I was wrong, because they actually  *do* state that the studio's notes made them go back and make Tai Lung scarier and more deserving of his imprisonment because the execs felt he was too sympathetic and Shifu looked like the bad guy.
* They frequently talk about scenes being reworked multiple times and changes "being better for the story." what this means is open to interpretation but I read it as there being outside influence.
* The scroll was originally a dragon sword, then something in a mysterious box. It took them awhile to come up with the idea of it just being a reflection.
* The final battle is full of really great callbacks to Po's journey and the things he learned.  Originally it was going to start in a volcano and "last for weeks" across mountains. They reworked it to actually tie into the rest of the movie.  In fact, a lot of the call backs magically came in late in the process.
* Instead of "Skidoosh!" we almost got Po belly-bouncing Tai Lung through 15 buildings until he landed in Po's bedroom, where he would look around and be confused by all of the memorabilia.  The Wuxi Finger Hold was in there, it just had had no payoff. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually have a second one, but it's not mine.  Someone in the IT department at one of the big three hospitals here in town apparently ran a script last weekend to delete all users who had been inactive for six months.  They didn't do it quite right.  It deleted everyone who'd been inactive for *six minutes*.  On a Saturday.  Next thing you know, they're going out buying reams of paper and clipboards because no one can get into EPIC and nobody at the hospital has used paper charts in years. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am an AmeriCorps VISTA who redid my small nonprofit's website, picking up where some other volunteers (who didn't document *anything*) had left off two years earlier.  The site's hosting had since changed from the registrar to a new company, but no one updated the DNS, so I couldn't get in to add a new database before I uploaded my site.  

SOOO once i figured this out, I pointed the DNS to the current host and went home.

The next day I came into work and the Executive Director was on the line with Microsoft Support.  Our Office365 had gone toes-up some point in the middle of the night...right around when the DNS change propagated.  Neither she nor they had *any* clue what the problem was.  


The MX records hadn't been moved either.  


Look at my flair.  Why, yes; I'm the idiot who didn't even know what an MX record was at the time.

It's incredible the amount of havoc one can wreak by missing the transfer of one little value.

Several MVA courses later, I'm now in charge of our entire network infrastructure.  Keep in mind there's no one else available to do it.  What'll I break next? It keeps me up at night. </TEXT>

I believe the inner numbered streets ~~were on Campau's plan and the outer ones~~ were on Lyon's original plan for the city (edit:whoops, should have reread that article; it's been awhile).  At any rate, the outer ones start at the absolute southern border of GR from ~1925 until the last few outer regions of town got annexed starting in the fifties. </TEXT>

I just got one and haven't tried it yet, but my older LTE phone was still sipping data off AT T's towers in Ludington a week ago (well after the expansion).  Some phones will become Band 12 capable once they are updated to 6.0.1, if I'm not mistaken, but otherwise if your phone isn't [on this list](https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phones.lte-band-twelve.html), you are probably out of luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Irrespective of this deal,  I just wanted to  share this warning. 

A few months ago this same site had Batman Arkham Origins for the same price.   I pulled the trigger and had them do an in-store pickup at one of the stores near me in Grand Rapids,  Michigan.   The next day I got an email saying it was ready to pick up... in Fresno,  California.  I called the store near me and they didn't  have my reservation... But they did have one from Kentucky and another from Florida. 

I called customer support and at first they flat out refused to believe me or acknowledge there was any problem.   Once I finally got two or three supervisors up,  they said they couldn't  help and I needed to call their eBay department.  The eBay department sent me back to the first support  number. 

This went on for a few hours,  every  successive rep making me hate humanity just a bit more than the last,  until finally I found someone who could cancel my order. They then attempted to place another order,  and charged me twice in the process.   They did not acknowledge there was any issue with their systems the entire time, even after the manager of my local store got involved and confirmed what they were seeing on their end. 

TL;DR don't be surprised if you reassess your definition of incompetence when ordering through this site.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's only true outside of Michigan. A's insurance doesn't get involved in B's damage at all at first.  B's insurance doesn't have a deductible for not-at-fault accidents under broad form, so there technically isn't a deductible to be paid.

Minitort can be used to collect a deductible reimbursement up to $1000 from the party at fault, but it happens less often than you would think.

Edit: the reason I state it this way is because, unlike other states, minitort is not automatic or guaranteed to work out. In another state, A rearends B, and after a short investigation A's insurance pays for B's damage. 

Under No Fault, B claims it all on his own insurance then submits paperwork to A's insurance company. This can be a long process, and if A's insurance finds a reason to deny B's claim, then B has to take A to small claims court. This is why some people don't follow through on the mini tort part. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1) Exchange information for purposes of a police report.  Both parties pay their deductible, unless B has a "broad form" collision policy.

2) Exchange information for purposes of a police report.  Vehicle A pays own deductible, Vehicle B is screwed.  Certain situations may call for a small "mini-tort" to be paid out to vehicle B, but don't hold your breath.

3) See #2, but Vehicle B might be in deep trouble if the cops show up.

4) (not asked but heading off a question): None of the above applies in a vehicle-vs-parked vehicle, object or pedestrian situation.  Then it's just like other states where A's insurance handles it. </TEXT>

The PS4's brand newish (TLOU bundle, got it three weeks ago), and it's happened since I got it.  I've gone back to the PS3 because of this (and the lack of a good media remote, not that this is Netflix's problem!). </TEXT>

<TEXT> They put a $15.99 hold on your card when you sign up to make sure they can bill the first month. My guess is that they don't allow you to sign up with a prepaid card because they automatically debit the account each month after the trial ends. A lot of subscriptions don't allow prepaid cards for this reason.  </TEXT>

* This is the property where Land and Company famously decided to evict everyone one day because they wanted to sell it to a developer. It's the same one that came up during Land's campaign. It's sat there for something like ten years without anyone developing it.
* It's not hard to see why given its location hidden behind a gas station and motel in what could easily be called the seediest part of Grandville.
* In this case "conveniently located near freeway access" means the property is bordered on one side by a double on-ramp.
* The "underutilized" gravel pit that makes up most of the rest of the border isn't exactly Versluis Lake, and has some serious heavy industry wasteland on the other side of it.
* Is there really a need for any project of this density in Grandville?
* Have I mentioned this is the worst part of Grandville? Seriously, it's downwind from the sewage treatment plant more often than not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Caffeine is something neurologists call a "partial agonist" to a lot of ADHD stimulants' target receptors, which long story short means it's going to fight for dominance with them and interfere with their effectiveness.  

This also makes it a rougher stimulant than anything used to treat the disorder (hence the prescriptions existing in the first place), so if anything your side-effect-to-efficacy ratio is going to actually be *worse* should you regularly use the amount of caffeine necessary to have a similar effect.

Talk to your doctor about switching to a Methylphenidate-type drug, maybe?  I am not a doctor. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm really struggling to reply to this in a civilized fashion.

If you want to have a constructive discussion about ADHD I suggest you not do so by posting an article that asserts that the disorder is "bullshit" within the first two sentences.

I have a disorder that's been dogging me my whole life.  Every damn day it is the greatest source of frustration in my life.  It's responsible for two depressive episodes.  It's driven me to attempt suicide.  It's caused me to delay having children on the chance that  they would go through the same things I did.  

Do you have any idea what it's like to live day to day with something like this and *then* have to deal with people acting like it's some sort of house of cards, and by proxy I must be a sucker to have lived my life like this?

None of the points in this article are novel, and all of them have been discussed for years, at length, by the ADHD community.  If you want to have a point-by-point discussion I'm game, but for now I need to get my kid to day care and frankly I'm too pissed off to go into detail.

It's easy to be an armchair expert on things on the Internet, and it's great fun to find sources that claim to provide some counter-intuitive "this is what's really happening" view of complex situations, but please be aware of the actual people caught in the middle of these things.  ADHD is a really fucking hard thing to deal with, and shit like this doesn't make it any easier. </TEXT>

I know you don't have any reason to believe some random guy on the internet, but I am a former employee of theirs and went from a frequent customer to never wanting to give another penny to those scoundrels because of having worked there. 


Just one of many examples: I one found a box of board books (toddler books with thick cardboard pages) that had been chewed into and filled with rat feces. I asked my manager what to do about it thinking we'd return them to the publisher or something. The owner was nearby, and he exploded at me, screaming at me asking what I meant by what should I do, and that I was not to throw any of his books away and if I valued my job I would shut up and immediately wipe them off and get then out to the stores. Toddlers chew on these things. He didn't even want me to try to disinfect them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My most extensive interaction with Floridians has been through the insurance company I used to work for. This is all anecdotal, of course, but it hasn't positively shaped my opinion of Florida.

I once filed a Florida auto claim where seven cars were damaged because a fight broke out at a children's Halloween party.

I once had a ~35 year old Floridian woman whining to me over the phone like a teenager.  Her house "wasn't livable" (a distinction of emergency we save for, say, having sewage pour out the front door) because it was 58 degrees outside.  

Also, I'd have to say Florida takes the cake for people causing accidents out of blatant stupidity then having the gall to curse out the *other guy* for being in the way.  I once had a rear-end accident where the person at fault insisted we file a claim with the other company's insurance.  His reason? "Douchebag was going five under."

I also once had a six car accident (HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN ON DRY PAVEMENT?) where the person at fault was texting, crossed the lane divider, and tried to flee the scene.  She kept trying to tell me it wasn't her fault and it was OK to leave--both because it was an important text message.

Yes, there are idiots everywhere (No other city gets in pileups when it rains, LA, stop acting like that's normal!), but there definitely seemed to be a high concentration of WTF with our Floridian customers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just looking at that from Google Maps I can tell it's absolutely a VOR station. They aren't necessarily all right next to the airport--the one at my closest major airport is about ~~three~~ (EDIT:nine!) miles away from it and all of the smaller airports' VORs within ~60 miles are used for navigation to this airport, too.  This one could have served Fairfax, Charles B Wheeler and/or KCI easily, and given the large number of airfields and history of aircraft production in the area I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't the only abandoned/ repurposed one in the area.  I'd say you can mark this solved. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Wikipedia says](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_International_Airport) Kansas City International was built after flooding in 1951 wrecked two other airports in the area.  Could this have been close to one of them?

Edit: Is this anywhere near the GM Fairfax Plant? That was built on the site of [one of those airports](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfax_Municipal_Airport), and The [Charles B Wheeler Airport](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_B._Wheeler_Downtown_Airport) is the second.

Edit 2: There's also [a former air force base 17 miles south of town](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richards-Gebaur_Air_Force_Base) and a former [Naval Air Station outside of Olathe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Air_Station_Olathe).  KC isn't lacking in this sort of place given its WWII manufacturing history.  

The first airport in the area was also about [9063 E. Gregory Blvd in Raytown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richards_Field) (though I wonder if this was closed too early to have its own VOR station).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This brings up another problem with two-dimensional maps and borders: 

Let's use [this map](http://www.chartgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/star-trek-map1.jpeg) for reference another time in this discussion.  The Federation is of course made up of member worlds and colonies, and not supposed to be an area of conquest like we would see using modern Earth's paradigm of "controlled" land. Say Bajor wants to join the Federation, but the Kobliads and whoever lives in the Regulon system don't want any part of it.  Do they redraw the map to include those systems anyway? Couldn't there be examples of systems where one planet is Federation and another isn't? An accurate map should color code member systems/planets and heat map areas of coverage/total membership.  

...Wait a sec... given the inevitability of some border overlap in an area as large as a galaxy (say the Regulon system belongs to Cardassia), why the heck did the colonists near Cardassia need to move around anyway?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ritalin doesn't build up like some other meds do.  It either turns on a light bulb or it doesn't.  It may be helping in subtle ways you don't notice yet (in which case staying on it will help you cope better), but it's very possible you need a bigger dosage. Call your psychiatrist's office and ask what they think. 

The single most annoying part of medication for ADHD is that it's trial and error.  Concerta or OG Ritalin (or, who knows? Adderall?) may also help better--everyone's different. You might not know what works for you until you've tried a few different things. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is on the doorway of the Meijer (Grocery/merch store like Wal-Mart without most of the suckage) store at 1997 East Beltline NE in Grand Rapids, MI.

All I've been able to find is it has something to do with a public TV series in the Netherlands about the labor movement over there. This area has a strong but traditionally conservative/anti-labor Dutch population, and the Meijer chain was started about 20 miles from this point by a member of that community during the Depression (there are maybe three Meijers closer to the actual birthplace), but beyond that I can't find any connection at all. No one I've talked to at the store knows a thing about it.  

Anyone additional information would be much appreciated. </TEXT>

- The Bissell Pavilion at the top of the hill/end of the funicular at the zoo is a much less creeper-ish option and it offers a similar view.

- Belknap park, natch.

- This is a weird one: the parking lot of the Showcase Cinemas on Alpine is a good spot for this too.

<TEXT> It's...complicated. Taste isn't a factor so much as aversion to food is.  I seem to remember^[citation ^needed] that appetite suppression has been linked to the patient's genetics, so YMMV. This stuff is used to treat eating disorders, though, so that gives you an idea of how powerful it is in this respect.

The effect only lasts so long as you are actually on the meds, so breakfast (and probably dinner) shouldn't be affected at all.  Methylphenidate already has a rough comedown, though, and low blood sugar makes it much worse, so it's not a good idea to let yourself have two meals.

Speaking personally: sometimes it's a simple matter of the MPD turning my focus into a freight train that barrels right past the feeding cue station and does not want to stop.  It honestly doesn't occur to me to eat, and I receive none of the classic hunger cues from my body except for my blood sugar inevitably crashing.  

SOMETIMES though it causes revulsion to the thought of food. I liken it to that feeling you get when you've eaten too much and someone offers you more food.  My body finds it hard to *believe* that it could need sustenance, and my brain doesn't appreciate being taken off hyperfocus mode to do something it doesn't think it needs to do.  

Pushing past this can be tricky but there are always things I can find that my body will be OK with.  I'm not a picky eater, but MPD makes me one.  Little snacks help but it's better to bite the bullet and eat a full meal on schedule.  I also have unrelated colitis, so this may be a factor in my case.

Honestly, the comedown from MPD is the biggest problem for me.  I turn into a big bearded diva if I'm not careful, so I NEED to remember to have lunch. This will seem unmanageable at first but go easy on yourself in the late afternoon (taking a 5 mg ritalin at around 2:30 also helps soften the down curve for some), and it will subside after awhile

Was the doctor putting you on *both* atomoxetine and MPD though?  As I said Strattera would be the bigger concern for me with the things you listed.

PS: Yeah, people can negative about this med.  I keep coming back to it though, and recently went back on after 2-3 years without anything.  People have cause to be negative about all of the meds, though.  Nothing is going to be 100% take-the-good-leave-the-bad.  It's a matter of finding what works best for you.  Adderall, for instance, is not something I want to touch ever again.  Other people on this sub will tell you the opposite, but that's just what works for our individual brains. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Obligatory disclaimer: Everyone reacts differently, and side effects scale with dosage.

I went on the stuff when it came out, went back and forth over the years trying many other meds and no medication, and here I am back on the 54. It's the devil I know at this point.

The lack of appetite is likely going to be the big one for you.  I've never really found balance beyond remembering to eat on schedule as if it were a chore. The good news is this only happens when you are on a dose.  Note also I am on a high dose, and it's not really a problem for me at lower doses.

As for sleep, I haven't had a problem with that since high school-just do your best to stay on a routine. Avoid caffeine. Seriously, don't even cheat a little. It will mess with the efficacy anyway.

No version of methylphenidate has ever done anything noteworthy with my BP, and honestly I wouldn't worry one bit about exercising on it. 

Strattera, on the other hand, makes me sweat like I'm melting. I thought you should know this happens to a lot of people.

<TEXT> WARNING:long.

I have to weigh in on "show them how to X *instead of medicating them*."  One of the cornerstones of something being a medical disorder instead of a habit is maladaptivity--medically, CAN'T ADAPT.  As in, no amount of applying head to wall is going to create a hole. 

Medication is supposed to help with this by, among other things, helping the person cope with exactly the same frustration/inability to relax that you describe--something they may have a drastically reduced ability to do for themselves until something is there to help them do it first.

You are advocating an authoritative approach to teaching coping mechanisms.  This is great.  If it could replace medication, don't you think doctors would be prescribing a lot less?  No one really likes giving kids these side effects.

I've never met a good doctor that says that medication is the only solution.  But for some ADHD patients it is absolutely the foundation of the solution, and it's a bit dangerous to say otherwise.

I don't like meds. Let me be clear on that.  I've been on most of them, hated 90% of it, and would rather never see a pill again.  I get why people are reluctant to give this stuff to their kids.  But I've become a published expert on the disorder in my twenty-four years of being treated for it, and some days I know I need a Concerta in the morning, and I'm damn glad my parents knew it too.

I'm commenting because I've experienced way too many people who think ADHD can be taught away, and frankly that's a pet peeve of mine because it feeds into something horrifying: many parents have trouble accepting that ADHD (and a probable need for medication to allay it) is a part of who their child is, and therefore have trouble accepting their child for who s/he is before the ADHD is 'fixed.'  I'm not suggesting this is anywhere near where you are coming from, but anti-medication stigma and "learning not to be disabled" are big parts of what enable people to think that way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [Vibranium in the comics](http://marvel-movies.wikia.com/wiki/Vibranium) comes from Wakanda, and they aren't keen on sharing it. In Cap 1 Howard Stark says that the shield is made from all of the stuff they have found, and that of course gets iced with Cap. Stark apparently worked on synthesizing it and couldn't, so he hid his notes for Tony to try again once technology was sufficiently advanced. Also note that it isn't explicitly stated in screen that the element was Vibranium, though apparently it was in the novelization.

<TEXT> As with everything, the insurance company will only pay for so much, but usually that's enough.  The key word above is BMW.  Dealership/body shop labor costs typically bump the ceiling of what an insurance company is willing to pay (most dealers farm it out to a glass company whose labor rates are acceptable though), and premium shops smash right through it with their insistence on use of OEM parts sourced through their own supplier with their own markups. 

I've had more than one BMW shop rep flat-out tell my insured right in front of me that I was trying to screw him/her--This while quoting a $2000 price for the part when I was looking right at the NAGS list and it said $4-500.  

A lot of high-end places won't even go through insurance channels because they don't expect to come to any reconciliation on price.  Doesn't mean the insurance company isn't going to fully pay for the family glass company down the street to install a quality windshield and back it to the hilt.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't know where you are of course  OP, but California law states that an insurance company has to replace parts with ones of equal or greater value, OEM or not.
 Thanks in part to common law (and a dozen or so regulations) this means most windshields available through insurance in the US are of close enough quality that no one cares about depreciation unless they're dealing with a snooty premium dealership who thinks every part of the car should be treated like an organic grass-feed golden goose pooped it out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't think of an (North American) insurance company that would change a person's rates after one windshield replacement. Most allow one or two a year per vehicle before they raise an eyebrow. Also if the shop happens to be network, the insured gets a lifetime warranty on most cases. This is maybe the one one situation where I advise people to claim it without a second thought. </TEXT>

I'd guess any incompatibility is a digital version vs. hard copy thing rather than a Plus/non Plus thing. [Here is a CAG thread](http://www.cheapassgamer.com/topic/302105-retail-to-digital-save-compatibility-list-for-retail-games-on-psn/) listing most or all of the games that should work if so.

<TEXT> Try to think about this medically. A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who treats disorders of the brain. Being a neurological disorder, ADHD fits the bill for that. Medically speaking you're visiting a specialist just as you would if you needed a consult with a hand surgeon after a car accident. This is not, NOT about being crazy or emotionally disturbed. Banish that thought from your mind. There is hard medical science behind the diagnosis and treatment of this disorder and they aren't going to toss antidepressants or what-have-you at you without a good medical reason.

That said some antidepressants are used in treatment of certain types of ADHD, and there's nothing wrong with taking them. There's a lot of stigma surrounding psychiatry and psychopharmacology and for the most part, as you are expanding firsthand, that's all hurtful bullshit to those thinking they may need help from meds. It's just medicine. You aren't any less of a person on Ritalin or strattera than someone with myopia would be wearing glasses.

Most importantly, though, share your concerns with your psychiatrist and be honest and upfront with him or her. This person's job is to help you, and they need you to be open with them for them to do their job. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Recently retired my old HTC G2 for T-Mobile's LTE version of the Galaxy S3. It was the most economical upgrade available to me (wanted an HTC One tbh), and i  have to say I was expecting more positives out of the upgrade. 

I love the screen, the speed, the camera, even many of the tacked-on features of Samsung's rendition of Jelly Bean (as compared with my Nexus 7), but I could swear sound fidelity over earphones is nowhere near as good in the low range and after the aluminum-lined tank that my old phone was I feel like this thing is going to snap in half in my hand. Also, the G2 ran two days on a charge under normal use. Yeah. </TEXT>
