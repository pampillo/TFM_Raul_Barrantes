<TEXT> This is a story that ive never really considered sharing because I have no idea on in what way it would help me. I just became a decently active reader on r/nosleep and I figured that it might feel better after I shared it with this community. Since english is not my native language, please grammar and spelling faculties.

Maybe I give you some insight of my background, Im 33 years old, owning a decent apartment that is just enough for me and working currently for a company called Pfizer and sitting at a desk most of my time. May not be the most exciting occupation, but still its good money. I spent most my spare cash on a beefy computer that Im writing on currently because Im pretty much of a gaming addict and it made me a bit overweight a couple months ago so I got motivation for starting to gym more often. I got a dog that I named Orisa, some of you can confirm now that Im addicted for gaming.

Anyhow, before I worked for Pfizer, I worked with cars, fixing them when people needed them to be repaired from a recent car crash or maybe just get a new paint job. But I quit this job for one experience that I had and it starts with a client.

At 09:00 I was assigned to open up the workshop by my boss and start the day. I only needed to be there in the morning because there was a newcomer coming that was going to work with the stuff that I usually take care of, so after opening, I could return home and come back at around noon. This was great because then I got more time than usual to do my hobby and gym before needing to be back.

At 11:15 I just got out of the shower to get ready for the workshop, dressed on a pretty shitty shirt that once were white but has now turned grey, baggy jeans that had gotten padded several times around the knees.
Got in my volvo V70 and drove to work.

Getting there, the newcomer was just going to leave and a co-worker called Nic was showing him out. I walk over to Nic and ask:

How was he?

I dont know man, he seems odd

Why?

Nic freezes for a bit and then gives me a wooden answer

Nah im probably just being paranoid

Haha, alrig-

Before I can finish talking he just turns around and walks towards the exit and says facing away, while walking: 


Imma grab lunch, see you

This shocked me more than most people probably would be from this occasion, because Nic is the person in this workshop that is the most social, most people get annoyed because he talks way too much and ive never seen him this way, so quiet. He might just had a very bad day?

13:00 - Nic hasnt come back from his lunch yet, which bothers me a little, since he always attends to his works hours. Im overthinking it, gotta get back to work.

Just as I finish the thought, I hear my boss voice in my walkie talkie:

We got a customer coming in with a pretty wrecked car, can you take care of it Patrick?

Yep I responded and headed for the car entrance.

When I get there I see the car, and yes it is pretty wrecked, the hood has been smashed in at least 1 decimeter towards the glass, which is all shattered and smoke seeping out from most corners around the whole vehicle. Its a pretty nice car, an Audi RS7 I think, Id be depressed if I had that nice of a car and then wreck it like that. I walk up to him but he doesnt even look the least depressed, a bit worried at its maximum. Coming closer I can hear him swear silently: 

..fucking bitch why?

Pretending like I didnt hear him, I say casually:

Now thats kind of a wreck isnt it? 

He nods.

What happened to it?, I asked.

No answer, hes just staring at the car.

Uhm, for fixing the whole car and adding some replacements itll cost around $1000 I continue awkwardly.

Still being quiet, but seems to have heard me at least. Reaches down in his pocket and pulls out a dusty wallet, takes out a bunch $100 bills and hands them over to me. I count it up to 10 and say: 


Thank yo...u? I studder when I notice, he had already left, whats the deal today? Do I smell bad?

We didnt have many customers that day, so me and another guy called Taemin stayed late to finish the car that the weird man wanted repaired. At around 21:00  there was only me and Taemin left in the workshop. Then he gets a call, the alarm had went off in his house and so he rushed home from the workshop. Now there was only me in the workshop, glimmering light from a weak light bulb and maybe some flies circulating around the only source of light.

22:30 I was just about to finish the car, attaching the last strip that would hold up the last piece of window that had been cracked before.
Thats when I hear the sound, like a rusty table being dragged across a stone floor. I recognize the sound, it comes from the gate which needs to be opened in order for the cars to enter.

Walking out to check who opened the gate I get struck to terror, there is the man, blood stains over the neck dripping down over his shirt. He never looked me in the eyes before, a shudder spreads down my spine when I see it, he had no pupil, his eyes were covered in white, no feelings,  dead inside, he stares at me, a feeling like hes gripping my soul with his look. As he approaches me I feel like I cant move, I cant scream, I want to look away from those eyes.
He is so close I can feel his breath in my face, and then It all goes black.

In a pool of sweat i feel my heart beating 200 and i turn on my nightlight to check the my alarm.
As the light fills the room i get struck with terror, hes standing in the corner. the white eyes.

<TEXT> It was a regular evening in a swedish summer and the clock started to tick towards 5, so my friends and I decided to go by the local supermarket and buy some grill compartments, things like sausages and buns with ketchup etc and some soda. We were really prepared for this evening just like every other in summer break.

We were heading for the pier to set up a fireplace and make some delicious sausages and maybe take a few jumps from the tree that is hanging over the still water reflecting the sunset.

After eating our sausages and taken a swim in the lukewarm water we sat there around the fire with swim clothes on and wrapped in towels, it started to be dark and we discussed whether we would all go home to respective houses or if we would change our clothes, dry up and do something teenagery.

The result ended up being that most of the party left because they were cold and tired.
In the aftermath there was only me and my closest 2 friends, Dan and Carlson.
We had come to a conclusion that we would do something, but exactly what, we had no clue on what to do.
Standing clueless for a couple of minutes Dan comes up to the idea of that we could take our skateboards over to Aspudden (another area close to Mlarhjden), and this place is quite known for being a slum area and the sun had just set so that didnt really make the safety improve.

For being as stupid as we were, we decided why not bring some spray cans and practice our graffiti skills while we were on the go.

All of us splitted up to our homes to get our skateboards and get changed to a bit darker clothes so that it would be harder to bust if someone caught us spraying graffiti over walls. We decided to meet in 10 minutes again at the local supermarket.

When getting there 2 minutes late I see that only carlson is standing there with his skateboard and backpack, arriving close to him I ask where Dan is and he says he got a call from him and Dan said that his mom needed help with some things and that he couldnt join us.
Being bad friends or caring friends we thought it was maybe for the best, Dan isnt exactly the fastest of them all when it comes to running away from people.

We dropped our boards on the ground and kicked it towards Aspudden.

After rolling in a slight downhill for like 15 minutes we finally see the familiar buildings of a hairdressers salon, tobacco business and a chinese restaurant. There was not many people on the street at this time, which was good regarding our practicing.

We went to an alley that is created from an empty space between a store and an apartment.
It was famous for the walls were completely covered in spray paint from top to bottom in all the colors that you could think of. The ground is wet from beer remains and other scents that I cant identify. You could really feel the weird atmosphere sleeping in that alley.

We pulled out some white and black and started to do some basic tags, representing that we were here and warming up our wrists while waking up our artistic senses as Carlson said.

In the end of the alley there is a staircase deep in close to a wall which goes as a spiral up until you reach the roof, up there, there is not as much graffiti because of the huge metal cage that surrounds the bottom of the stairs, only way to access this staircase is to try to climb this huge cage or trying to get the steel door open.

We didnt want to waste time on a single lock that would probably never open if we used force with only our bare hands, so we decided to try and climb the cage.
Me being most fit in this story, I am going to try to get over this fence first. Carlson sits down on his knees and ready to boost me up next to the metal. I run towards the cage and manages to grapple the cages edge and is now hanging, I find Carlsons hand and I place my foot on it so he pushes me up. When I get up, carlson throws up his backpack, I catch it and I drag him up to me on the cage.

From the top of the cage there is a thin opening where you can squeeze through and get to the stairs. We get through and start to walk up the spiral stairs and finally reaches the rooftop.

Its beautiful, seeing the street lights and empty roads from this height. It gives a feeling like you could overcome all the problems that youd ever face.
On the roof, people have managed to drag up old couches, tables and there is a fireplace on the top that seems has to been recently put out. We dont think much about it and starts to unpack our spray cans and getting ready to make art.

Midway through our work, I hear a small thud sound. I look over to Carlson to see if he noticed it too, and  yes, there he is standing like frozen, listening for more incoming sounds. No more sounds are coming, so we tip-toe over to the edge to look down to the staircase to see if someone was coming. But the staircase is empty, not a soul is moving in the alley.

We figure it mightve come from one of the rooms in the apartment that we actually are standing right above so continue with our work. After 5 about 5 minutes we hear a chatter that we really notice is extremely close to us, we walk over to the staircase but see nothing, still the chatter continues. Were confused of that we hear the chatter but still cant identify where it is coming from. We search the whole roof and checks over the other edge of the building down to the road and there we see it.

There is an old man across the street, standing on his balcony, looking at us with a phone in the hand. We freak out and swiftly gather all our cans and throws them down in the backpack and rushes towards the staircase. We hurry down the stairs feeling like every step is an eternity. We start to hear sirens - the man on the balcony mustve called the police. This sets our adrenaline to an even intense state, frustratingly taking step after step downwards. Thats when Carlsson loses it of stress. He tells me that it takes too slow and he skips over the fence and jumps down to the ground from at least 3 meters down. On impact he gives a painful sound before disappearing into the woods defining Aspudden from the forest.

When I finally get down I hear the sirens are extremely close so I start taking pace into the forest.
Running through feeling like an eternity but then finally seeing the square of Mlarhjden, takes up my phone and sends Carlsson a message, lol. </TEXT>
