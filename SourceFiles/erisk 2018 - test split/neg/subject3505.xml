<TEXT> It will definitely speak to the modem/router interaction. If there is a difference, a possible cause might be the cable connecting them. It is rare, but I have  seen instances where a cable worked well with one setup, but not so well with another. 

If you discover a difference, the cable hypothesis can be easily tested by trying another cable between modem   router. If the difference persists, then you are down to sorting out a peculiar interaction between modem   router. This can be difficult to resolve.  </TEXT>

This falls into the category of "what do you watch after you cut the cord?" When the show returns I expect it to be available for streaming on Hulu. That's how I watched the most recent group of episodes last year.

<TEXT> Trapped is excellent! I watched all 10 episodes in one long binge. I enjoyed it a lot. However, Trapped does not stream on Netflix in the US. You can get it from Netflix USA on DVD.

Right now the only place in the US to stream Trapped is 

https://www.viceland.com/en_us/show/trapped

Requires paid cable/satellite subscription authorization.

An excellent 10-part mini-series.

<TEXT> Have you considered a cord shaving solution like switching to the Dish Flex Pack? That gets you 50 channels for $30/month. You can add various theme packs (locals, variety, family, etc) for $10 each. Since you have locals from your antenna, you might find the $30 Flex works for you. It includes most major channels.

<TEXT> OK. Looks like you have the major network affiliates coming from towers about 50 miles away at about 310 degrees magnetic. PBS   ABC  are High-VHF, that is probably the biggest reception challenge with the GE antenna. 

I suggest you try the new antenna in the attic pointed at 310 degrees and see how it goes. If you have issues, mounting the antenna outdoors should get at least another 3db of signal and might save the day. </TEXT>

If you are lucky enough to have good broadband you have many other options including SVOD (Netflix, Amazon, etc) and linear streaming services (SlingTV, Vue, etc.).

And don't forget that Netflix still has DVD by mail plans.

<TEXT> Looks like you should get an excellent signal on all major channels with an outside antenna (Hi-VHF/UHF) pointed about 220 degrees magnetic.

You might want check the signal with a TV near the antenna to make sure there are no specific problems before you run an extended cable to your room. Sometimes an older antenna may have a problem with the heritage hardware or existing cable attached to the antenna. In my experience that is not common, but it does happen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Believe it or not, the classic cable TV channel guide is patented! The patent holder charges a hefty fee to have a guide in that style.

https://www.google.com/patents/US5585866

Some companies pay, others try an alternative presentation.

The legal fight about the legitimacy of the patent has gone back   forth in the courts for years. In recent years the patents have suffered some setbacks. However, using the classic format without paying a license fee is still likely to wind up in court.

<TEXT> Lots of folks have a DBS satellite TV dish on the top of their RVs. When they park at a destination they need to orient the dish for their specific longitude   latitude; then they can watch TV. 

A satellite Internet installation demands even more precision in aiming the dish than TV. The dish is not only receiving signals, it is sending microwave signals to a satellite 22,300 miles above the equator. This is not something you easily could do through glass. And it would be impossible from a moving vehicle.

If you seek a broadband connection from a moving vehicle, cell phone technology is the only practical method.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Latency depends on the distance the signal has to travel between the satellite and the ground. All geostationary communications satellites are in an orbit approximately 22,300 miles (35,786 km) above the equator. The time it takes for signals to travel 22,300 miles round trip is 240-280 mS, depending on location on the ground.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit

The proposed satellites will be in a much lower orbit at an altitude between 1,150 Km and 1,275 Km. Since radio waves travel at the speed of light which is 300,000 km per second, the round trip latency would be about 7.6 mS. This is a lot shorter than traditional satellite broadband.

The low orbit means that these satellites will not be geostationary, will need significant on-board fuel to maintain their orbits, and will have to be replaced on a regular basis. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Streaming linear TV channels are less expensive than those same channels on cable, but it is still linear TV. Aside from live events   news, video on demand is my strong preference for how I consume content. 

The one very useful thing I get from linear TV channels is content curation. So I find a lot of interesting old films via Turner Classic Movies. That said, I really want to watch that content (including the TCM introductions) in a Netflix-like environment. I don't want to hunt through a month worth of program guide info to set a recording timer so I can watch a film at my convenience.

I used to imagine a utopian future where I could subscribe to TCM a la carte. Not anymore. Now my utopian wish is for TCM as Netflix.

<TEXT> PVR = DVR. The term PVR (personal video recorder) predates the shift to digital video. Somewhere around the house I still have an old PVR PC card that I used to record analog OTA broadcasts back in the day. 

I use both terms to refer to devices that record digital video data streams from cable, satellite, or OTA broadcast sources. The preferred modern acronym for such a gizmo is DVR. 

Check out the link I posted to see what's on offer these days in off-the-shelf DVRs.

<TEXT> Given your TV Fool report I don't think an indoor antenna would be a good fit for you. However, you might want to get one from a retailer that has a good return policy (Walmart, Best Buy, etc.) and see what you can receive.

I would suggest a Hi-VHF/UHF outdoor antenna like the Channel Master Cm-2018. Should run $65+, depending on where you buy it. Install it on a 15ft+ mast pointed at 122 degrees magnetic and you should be all set. </TEXT>

You essentially have 2 inexpensive choices for a tuner. Check out the Mediasonic HW-150PVR HomeWorx and the iView. They are basic tuners   VCR-like recorders that use the program information that stations include with the ATSC signal.

http://www.tvfool.com/?option=com_wrapper Itemid=29 q=id%3ddfaf088120958d

Point almost any outdoor antenna due south (177 degrees) and you should have great reception. 

KPRC NBC identifies itself as channel 2. It is actually broadcasting on channel 35; it is a UHF signal. Channels 8, 11, and 13 in Houston are VHF signals actually broadcasting on 8, 11, and 13. You will need an antenna that is VHF capable to get an optimum picture in most locations. </TEXT>

According to TVFOOL.COM KFFV is 4.8 miles from your location at 145 degrees while KVOS is 78 miles away at 343 degrees. You will need a very substantial outdoor antenna pointed almost due north to pick up KVOS. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are correct, but in fact most Social Security recipients have too much income to qualify. 

Only those 65+ who qualify for SSI are eligible for the Charter discount. SSI is not social security; it is a separate safety net program established in 1935 for the blind, the permanently    totally disabled, and the elderly. To get SSI benefits a senior who is not blind or disabled must have no more than $9k/year in combined wages   social security benefits. You have to be nearly indigent to qualify for SSI   Charter broadband. The SSI benefit is reduced for every dollar you get from wages or Social Security and goes to zero when you hit the approximately $9k threshold.

For those interested you can read the many details here:

I'm sure similar items are on offer at Best Buy, Amazon   the other usual venues.

You will have much better picture   sound than with an old standard def  CRT TV.

<TEXT> I have Ooma and like it a lot. 

Came to it after trying several other inexpensive VOIP solutions that did not work all that well. The Ooma, on the other hand, has been great.

I get billed by Ooma about $4/month through my credit card for various taxes and fees (e.g. local 911 support). That's the only continuing cost. I paid $100 (on sale) a couple of years ago for the box.

"Connects to Cable or Antenna"

"The TiVo BOLT isn't just for cable subscribers. It also lets cord-cutters connect their over-the-air antenna so they can maximize their free local channels with TiVo's advanced control and recording features." 

Tivo is making a public presentation in Dallas tomorrow, so there may be more reporting or product brochures to shed light on this.

Put in your zip code and select the "Broadcast Stations" channel lineup. You will see the 88 channels available in Houston and their programming. While there are many specialty channels (religion, shopping, languages other than English) there are a lot of channels with broad appeal.

If what you see appeals to you, install an outside antenna and run antenna cable to your TVs. If you don't like commercials consider adding a Tablo, Channel Master or Tivo DVR so you can time-shift programming and skip commercials. The antenna   DVR will pay for themselves in less than a year.

Remember to check TVFool.com for specifics about signal quality   where to point your antenna.

<TEXT> Yes   no. The poles are put up under a government license because they use the public right of way. As such they are subject to a lot of regulation. 

Local governments want to encourage competition. Access to poles is part of that. Naturally, the incumbent utility usually is not eager to share poles, so access for a reasonable rent is a requirement imposed by the licensing government. 

Governments also do not want a forest of poles set up by multiple utilities. Getting the competition on existing poles is part of that. 

It is also economically much more efficient to have multiple utilities on one set of poles. The various utilities can share capital costs   maintenance.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exactly! You want to put the antenna on the roof and run RG6 or better coax down to the basement. In most situations that means the cable goes down the outside of the house and gets into the basement via a small hole drilled through the wall. If this is something you are not comfortable doing, find an antenna installer in your community to do the work.

Of course, if you already have coax cable going to the basement from previous satellite or cable service, you can certainly make use of that.

<TEXT> Since you don't have access to cable or broadband and your OTA stations are very limited, you might want to consider satellite TV.

If that does not appeal to you, you could try contacting a local antenna installer to put up a tower antenna. Getting the antenna 30 feet off the ground significantly improves the signal for your zip code, according to TVFOOL.

<TEXT> I take your point that comsats are a tangible asset that can be sold to another company. But it should be noted that they are depreciating assets. 

Modern spacecraft have a useful orbital life of about 15 years. This is dictated by the amount of station-keeping fuel on board at launch. Communications satellites in Clarke Belt orbits are above the equator at an altitude of about 22,300 miles. They are subject to microgravitational forces that tend to move the satellite into an inclined orbit that moves it above   below the equitorial plane. The fuel is expended to maintain stability with the equitorial plane so the signal can be easily handled by downlink antennas. The birds are adjusted every few weeks by active control from ground stations. When the onboard fuel is nearly exhausted (in about 15 years) the remaining fuel is used to move the satellite into a higher (graveyard) orbit to clear the slot for a replacement satellite. 

My point is that a comsat has a finite, approximately 15-year useful life. If some way to refuel orbiting satellites is devised, then most satellites could be used longer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> RetroTV is broadcast on KUVM-CD on channel 34.4. Very much UHF. The transmitter is in the Missouri City tower farm, broadcasting with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 11,000 watts. It is a low power signal. By contrast, KPRC on real channel 35 broadcasts from that same tower complex with 1 million watts ERP.

Two suggestions to troubleshoot your problem.

1. Check your TV setup to make sure that you have it configured to receive over-the-air ANTENNA signals (as opposed to CABLE signals). A TV misconfigured for cable will receive some, but not all, broadcast frequencies. I have made this mistake on at least one occasion.

2. If your TV is properly configured for OTA signals and moving the antenna to a few alternate locations does not improve your results, it is time to head to a big box store: Home Depot, Lowes, Best Buy, etc. Buy a different, well reviewed antenna   keep your receipt. Try it out and see what happens. If it doesn't work you can take it back and try another antenna. If nothing does the trick you should call the station to see if they can offer advice.

<TEXT> If you live in or near a city of 50K or more you should be able to get a lot of what you want for free OTA with an antenna. Use TVFool.com to find out what is receivable in your area.

See the /r/ota subreddit to inform your antenna decision. If you use a DVR you can watch what you want, when you want, and skip the commercials.

Many of us no longer think in terms of channels. We focus on on specific content and watch via streaming-on-demand or from our DVR as our interests lead us. 

If you add a set top box (STB) like a Roku you watch a lot of interesting content for free or a modest fee. The Roku now has over 2500 "channels" of content. Among all that you should be able to find 20-30 that interest you or members of your household.

If you absolutely need cable-like programming, you can subscribe to Sling TV for $20/month and get a lot of the more popular channels streamed through your Roku or other STB.

Recording OTA is a great way to get content, but you should check local availability (TVFool.com) if you haven't already done so.

Also, I agree with Tessaray. You should consider a dedicated DVR like Tablo. Great way to manage   distribute OTA stuff around your home.

<TEXT> There is no getting around the high latency when using geostationary satellites. Physics. Phone conversations would be difficult at best. 

But many application are not much affected by latency. For instance uploading or downloading files, streaming video, web surfing, texting, email, etc.

Spectrum could be used very efficiently by relying on frequencies in Ka band or above and having lots of spot beams. The same frequencies could be used over   over (similar to cell phones) with good design of the spot beam configuration. A satellite with a CONUS slot could have a combined downlink footprint with coast-to-coast coverage all the way from the Yukon to the Yucatan.  

The data cap issue is a separate concern. That may be a function of the power generation capacity of orbital assets and the cost of getting some very big   expensive satellites into orbit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a deal like that back when there was still subscription programming on C-band satellite. I think it was "pick any 15 channels for $20/month". Additional (non-premium) selections were $2/month each. If you paid for an entire year at a time you got one month free. Not a bad deal. Of course, you had to have several thousand dollars worth of satellite TVRO equipment to be able to do that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You could use a Roku 1.  It has an AV composite out option.

https://www.roku.com/products/roku-1

However, since it sounds like your TV only has a coax rf input, you will need to run the Roku output through a modulator to give you a channel 3 or 4 signal. You can still find rf modulators on sale at many places. Here is one from Amazon.

<TEXT> This is an extra charge for retransmission rights for signals that are broadcast free to air. These are signals that many of us can   do get for free by using an antenna.

One potential problem with retran fees is that they introduce a perverse incentive for broadcasters. If they run the transmitter at the lowest power allowed by their license they can reduce operating costs and the propagation of the broadcast signal. That might cause the station to be unwatchable for many households in the DMA. If they get cable so they can watch the station they will now be paying an extra $60/year for the "free" signal. That money goes directly to the broadcasters   their networks.  </TEXT>

This is where one or two antennas are placed at an optimal location on the roof of an apartment building and the signal is distributed by coax cable to all apartments. This is generally an undertaking by the building management group.

You can see an image of such a system here:

<TEXT> I think that the labor costs to support a la carte will be about the same as what they are now. Much of the process can be automated with back office   customer-facing web software.

The big savings will be in reduced programming fees for content that is currently bundled. For example, in the US ESPN is contractually bundled into almost every cable   satellite package. That is an estimated $7/month ($84/yr) per customer that the cable company has to pay ESPN. In an a la carte world every customer that did not select ESPN would be $7/month less that the cable company has to pay ESPN. I see that as a cost reduction. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The thing is it actually costs cable companies more money to provide everybody with 20 channels (or whatever) of their choice than it does to provide all 200 channels to everybody. There is no cost savings involved, so I can never understand why people think a la carte will be cheaper for the average person. 

Why do you say that it would cost more?

<TEXT> Your antenna will not stop working in 6 months. It will be fine. The CSR is delusional. You will not need a "box" for your antenna.

You might want to buy a DVR for your antenna channels. You can use it to time shift programs and nuke commercials. But you don't need one to get programming from an antenna.

Read about antennas using the links in the Cordcutter Guide box on the right side of this page.

Run your location through the TVFool.com web site to see what kind of antenna might be required for your area.

<TEXT> It is one of those shocking bureaucratic decisions that defies logic. 

As I understand it, the cable industry got themselves a law which says that it is presumed that cable does business in a competitive environment, so there is no need for local jurisdictions to regulate basic cable. (A Bush era law previously took away the ability of local communities to regulate cable offerings beyond basic.) 

If a community thinks that there is no competition in their market they have to petition the FCC to get permission to regulate the basic service tier by rebutting the presumption of competition. In this instance a community's petition to regulate the local TWC system was denied because the FCC said the community did not offer convincing evidence that there was not adequate competition. 

Kind of takes your breath away!

I tried it. It works. Beyond that I don't know anything about it.

I don't watch Fox or any cable news services except BBC, DW, France 24, and Bloomberg. Just trying to be a good citizen   respond to the OP. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You may want to consider this Monoprice HDMI switcher with digital audio output.

http://www.amazon.com/Monoprice-TOSlink-Digital-Coaxial-Channel/dp/B005E2XLI2

Switches 4 HDMI inputs into one HDMI output and also gives an optical audio output from the active input. I use one of these to switch a Roku3, Blueray player, home theater PC,   satellite receiver into a single HDMI going to my TV. The digital audio output goes to my a/v receiver for surround sound.

I really like mine. Works great.

<TEXT> Interesting results. I would be more confident about the findings if they had reported the sampling method, sample size, and margin of error. 

From context we can guess that the interviews were conducted in July - August 2015. But we don't know if it is a US national sample or international. Indeed, we don't know for sure that it was a probability sample, nor do we know sample size. It is very hard to interpret survey results without those parameters. </TEXT>

http://www.amazon.com/Ookla-Speedtest-net-Mobile-Speed-Test/dp/B00F9F1G4U

Then you could try connecting the stick via an HDMI extension cable to see if moving the stick to a slightly different position increases bandwidth. Sometimes something as simple as getting a device out from behind a TV can make a big difference in a Wi-Fi connection.

<TEXT> It is worth putting up a roof mounted antenna and seeing what you can get from the north. That said, you might have better luck with a roof mounted antenna pointed to the southwest. Depending of course on the terrain. TVFool documents a significant number of channels from the southwest.

You are going to have to do a bit of experimenting with an outside antenna to find usable signals. If you are not able to get up on the roof yourself, call an antenna company to come out   do the install. Remind yourself that you have no monthly fees after the initial investment in a good antenna. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A very interesting read!

I'm all for getting rid of retran fees. If a station wants the free use of public spectrum to broadcast, the signal should be available to all within the DMA for free under a compulsory "must carry" rule.

You could get the content from an OTA antenna, or free as part of a cable or satellite service.

If you allow retran fees it creates a perverse incentive. Stations find it in their financial interest to broadcast a lousy signal in order to get citizens to sign up for cable or satellite and pay carriage fees for a broadcast signal. </TEXT>

As you can see, you have access to a substantial number of broadcast signals. An outdoor antenna pointed at 50 deg true north would get you all major networks, PBS (WNET) and a bunch of independents. Add an OTA DVR and you are set to watch a lot of content   skip commercials if you desire.

My favorite set top box is a Roku because it is simple to use and has the most programming choices, but many of the newer STBs should do what you want.

Video   audio podcasts are a major source of content for many cord cutters. You can watch or listen to what your want, when you want it, on whatever device you prefer.

It is interesting   significant when traditional media (e.g. NPR) embrace podcasting.

<TEXT> Sadly, ReplayTV is essentially useless. I owned one that I sent to recycling a few years ago. The device has an analog (NTSC) tuner. US broadcast signals have been digital (ATSC) since 2009.

Also, the DVR uses data from an Electronic Program Guide for most operations. However, the guide ceased distribution back in 2011.

I did salvage the 160 GB hard drive from my unit before I recycled it.

<TEXT> No. Buy a proper reflector   LNBF.

Besides the fact that FTA is linear polarization   DBS is circular there are two additional problems.

1) DBS LNBs are designed to receive frequencies that are just above the Ku band. They don't work well for Ku frequencies. You would need a Ku LNBF.

2) The reflector is too small (18x20). DBS birds have higher powered downlink signals and can work with smaller reflectors. Ku signals are lower powered and generally require a 30 inch or larger reflector in order to produce a usable signal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Airbox is a service broadcasting 8 channels of Starz   Showtime content in mp4 using ATSC digital sub-channel bandwidth. It requires a proprietary receiver/dvr. It provides a program guide   dvr for all regular OTA broadcast channels in addition to Starz   Showtime. 

Key thing is that it is all based on broadcast spectrum. No broadband service is involved.

Also, these are linear channel streams. No VOD, which makes the DVR service very useful.

<TEXT> I can say from personal experience that some SD video looks bad on some HDTVs.

My old 55" Philips HDTV turned most SD content into something resembling bad VHS. Some SD content looked up-converted, but OK.

My newer Sharp 60" HDTV does a MUCH better job. Almost all up-converted SD content looks quite OK.

<TEXT> Sounds like the second TV is configured for cable reception. 

Most TVs have a set-up menu that allows you to configure the TV's tuner for either OTA antenna or cable connection. The cable configuration remaps the channels and puts a lot of mid-band frequencies where you would be expecting UHF signals from an antenna. Find the configuration menu on the TV and see if you can reconfigure it for use with a broadcast antenna signal. That should fix the problem. </TEXT>

Two of my favorite services are Acorn ($5/month, try if free for a month https://acorn.tv/featured) and MHz (free, http://www.mhznetworks.org/). Acorn has non-US programs in English, MHz has world news services in English and crime/mystery shows in various European languages with English subtitles. No commercial interruptions with either Acorn or MHz.

<TEXT> If you want Comcast SportstNet and live in one of their DMAs, I think you will have to buy a cable subscription from Comcast. If you do not reside in a Comcast market you won't be able to subscribe.

In most metro areas you can get a lot of other sports content with an antenna. You can also pay for a variety of sport specific streaming services delivered over the Internet.

"Comcast SportsNet HD is a high definition simulcast of select programs from Comcast SportsNet including live sports and series. Each regional channel has its own separate HD feed (many also have an alternate HD feed as well) and decides what will be broadcast in HD."

I presume that Cablevision may offer some kind of special HBO Now offer to their broadband customers, e.g. only $10/month instead of $15/month from some "outside" provider. Otherwise, the only reason to choose Cablevision would be the convenience of having everything on the same billing statement. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This post doesn't mention it, but using an antenna with a DVR to record OTA TV and play it back without commercials can make a huge difference in being a successful cord cutter. 

About 1/3 of the content I watch is recorded via my antenna from the approximately 70 channels broadcasting in my community. This consumes no broadband data, is generally of very high quality, and lets me skip all those annoying commercials when I watch a program. Plus, you will save a lot of time. It's a real treat to watch a 1 hour program in 42 minutes and eliminate 18 minutes wasted on commercials.

<TEXT> From a consumer's point of view this could be either good or bad news. Depends on what the Downloadable Security Technology Advisory Committee (DSTAC) comes up with. Potentially, they might define a standard that would allow a person to buy an advanced STB from Best Buy or Amazon that could function as a traditional cable box, Roku, and DVR all-in-one. 

That said, I'm not very optimistic about the outcome. There are a lot of incumbent players looking to avoid competition.

<TEXT> If we pause to consider a tax on "infringing" satellites, the big problem is: what is up there that could be taxed? Answer, not much.

All the standard communications satellites are in a Clarke Belt orbit 22,300 miles above the equator. They are not over anything north or south of the equator.

They only birds that might show up over a US state would be spy satellites, weather   earth observatory satellites, some satellite phone infrastructure, and the GPS fleet.

Slim pickings.

<TEXT> I have no doubt that this service will be well received by many. But I will not be a subscriber. For me there are 2 problems. 

1) ESPN is bundled into the package. If it were an option, I might be happy to sign up minus ESPN. The ESPN channel is the most expensive item on basic cable. About $5/month in carriage fees paid by the largest cable companies. That means everyone who subscribes to the Dish service is paying at least $60/year for ESPN. I don't watch ESPN   I'm not the least bit interested in paying $60/yr for something I don't watch. If customers could subscribe to the service without ESPN for $15/month I might be on board.  

2) But that brings me to my other problem with the Dish service: no DVR capability so I could watch on-demand and skip commercials. Right now I almost never watch live TV. I record programs, watch them when convenient, and skip the commercials. In addition to avoiding a lot of very annoying commercials this lets me watch a 1 hour program in 43 minutes. I don't want a system that would compel me to watch commercials and cost me an extra 17 minutes for every show I watched.

I'm happy Dish is introducing this OTT service,   I hope it does well. But I'm going to wait for more a la carte granularity and DVR functionality before I dump my current satellite service. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Interesting! It never occurred to me that Google Fiber would not be covered by the FCC attachment fee rules. Google provides broadband and subscription TV services to households. Why wouldn't they be treated just like a cable company? 

Telco   cable companies pay these fees to whatever entity owns the poles. They must be allowed access (at fair market rates) to hang their wire/fiber unless the pole has no unused capacity. In modern distribution systems there is almost always unused capacity. 

It's been a few years since I looked at this, but typical attachment fees were running about $9-$12/year per pole under the FCC formula.

The series is a favorite of mine   I look forward to re-watching all the episodes over the next few months.

<TEXT> I like this idea. Using an $85 outdoor antenna, I get more than 70 programming channels over the air for free from local broadcast signals. I might be interested in supplementing that with an inexpensive selection of cable TV channels. I am NOT interested in paying retran fees to local stations for broadcast signals I can receive over the air. Making OTA broadcast services a streaming option for those who can't get a broadcast signal is the right approach. </TEXT>
