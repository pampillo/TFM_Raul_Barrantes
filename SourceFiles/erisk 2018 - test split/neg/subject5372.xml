<TITLE> [Question] Why does only one of my imgur links work on tableau public? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-09 02:24:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a workbook in which I am trying to detail a recent trip to Gettysburg. I have pictures on imgur that link back to a map, but I haven't been able to get the pictures to load. It loads the first one, but it doesn't load any of the others. 

Is there an issue with tableau public I don't know about regarding this? It seems to work fine in the workbook.

Note: I have only uploaded day one pictures. That is why the URL is blank for the other fields.

I have included the link below. The workbook is available for download.

<TEXT> Source: General Social Survey

Tool: Tableau

The data from this visualization comes from the General Social Survey (GSS). The survey is an interviewer based survey that is conducted biannually by NORC at the University of Chicago. If you would like to learn more about NORC and the GSS you can find their webpage at [http://gss.norc.org/](http://gss.norc.org/).

I was able to gather the data from GSS Data Explorer, which allows you to access all the data gathered by the GSS since 1972. This question is variable, relpersn which was gathered in 1998 and then from 2006  2016.

Once the data was gathered I used Tableau to visualize it. I used the WTSSALL variable to weight the data. I excluded the data from 1998 because I thought it was too far removed from the rest of the time series. If you have any questions, comment or tweet at us using the links below. </TEXT>

Tool: Tableau

In this data visualization, we use Tableau to determine if there is a relationship between political party preference and educational attainment. I gathered data from Wikipedia about partisanship and used the Cook Partisan Voting Index to represent political party preference numerically. I then gathered information on educational attainment from the Census Bureaus API for the 2015 American Community Survey. More detailed information is available in the data visualization. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It seems that there has been some confusion about the graphic and I am sorry about that I wanted to provide some info on most of the comments I am getting.

This picture is a portion of a data visualization I created yesterday that looks at the how often people attend religious services. I then attached a filter to let people see the results by the respondents confidence that there is a god. This image only shows how often people go to church that don't believe in God.

It seems that my title, filter, and logo have been confusing. I hope this helps straighten things out. If you want to see the whole data visualization, which I probably should have just linked, [you can find it here.](http://overflow.solutions/uncategorized/how-often-do-americans-go-to-church/)

Sorry again for the confusion. </TEXT>

I made a data visualization yesterday that shows how often Americans go to church. [[Link]](http://overflow.solutions/uncategorized/how-often-do-americans-go-to-church/) Part of that visualization was a filter that let you look at the results based on how confident the respondent was in the existence of God. I thought it was interesting how often people that don't believe in God go to church so I decided to share that here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wanted to take a look at marital status in the US at a fairly local level, so I used 2011-2015 ACS 5 Year data from the U.S. Census Bureau to create this visualization. I downloaded the data from American Factfinder. It was located in table DP02 under Marital Status. I edited out the rows I needed in Excel and then created the visualization in Tableau.

It is worth pointing out that these figures include only people that have the current marital status of Divorced. Someone that was divorced and remarried or someone that was divorced, remarried, and then widowed would not be captured in these totals. </TEXT>

I gathered the data for this tool from the Census Bureaus geography data that provided data on the total land area of each of the congressional districts. I then used Excel to clean the data and Tableau to visualize it. Since there have been changes to congressional districts boundaries in 4 states since the last population estimates were put out, I went ahead and built the visualization on the premise that the population of all the congressional districts are the same even though there are some differences. Since this is the case, the percentage of the population estimate should be treated as a rough, but decent estimate of the population. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Source: US Census Bureau, 2015 American Community Survey PUMS
Tool: Tableau

To create this visualization I used data published by the American Community Survey, a product of the US Census Bureau. I utilized the 2015 One Year Estimates Public Use Microdata Sample. The data can be found on the ACS Website. Once I had the data, I used Tableau to visualize the data. I grouped the Wages variable into the groups I wanted, formatted it, and published the visualization on Tableau Public.

It is worth pointing out that two major variables we are missing are length of time working at a job or in your field and a variable for the occupation of these workers. The ACS doesnt capture information about how long someone has worked in a given field. It would have been nice to have added the occupational data, but there a hundreds of occupation codes and we decided that was too daunting of a task to incorporate here, but hope to do so in the future.

Creating a perfect analysis of this would be nearly impossible, but for the most part, this data visualization seems to support the findings that on average women make less than men. You have to interpret these results based on the limitations we mentioned though.

<TEXT> I was playing around with using Google Sheets to import xml data and came up with this. It represents what are the most popular domains on r/dataisbeautiful for all posts with more than 10K karma. The way I have it set up, it will not auto update so this is as of 8:00pm 4/4/2017. [If you want to access the sheet you can find it here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iV8b6xhMevu7RGjpMWsayCz4oPLwTQr8W0mdITSjQ34/edit?usp=sharing)

After I had the data I used Tableau to create the tree map and the bubble chart. The tree map represents each individual post, and the bubble chart shows the total for each domain. You can change the size to be either the number of posts or the karma received. </TEXT>

I have moved a lot and the reasons for moving are very interesting to me so I created this visualization to get a better idea of why people move. I got this data from a tabulation done by the U.S. Census Bureau using Current Population Survey data. Once I had the data in a usable form I used Tableau to create the visualization. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its not quite an even split any more. The most recent estimate from the Census has it at about [80% urban - 20% rural.](http://www.citylab.com/housing/2012/03/us-urban-population-what-does-urban-really-mean/1589/)

This data is 5 years later than the 2010 Census, is only people 25 and older, and the NBER methodology might be slightly different so I was okay with the proportion being around a 85 -15 split. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 2011-2015 ACS
Tool: Tableau

I wanted to create a visualization that showed how educational attainment compared between rural and urban areas. To gather the data for this visualization, I utilized the Census Bureaus API to create a custom table for myself. I decided to use the ACS 5 Year Estimates for 2011-2015 so I could get data on all counties since rural counties usually have small populations. I used the html address below to pull the data. You will need a free API Key to pull data from their site.

http://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs5/profile?get=NAME,DP02_0058E,DP02_0059E,DP02_0060E,DP02_0061E,DP02_0062E,DP02_0063E,DP02_0064E,DP02_0065E for=county:* key=

I then needed to come up with a measure of what is a urban and rural county. I decided to use a crosswalk the NBER has for putting counties into the metro areas that they are assigned. The documentation for this table states that blank entries for metro areas can be considered to be rural so that is what I used for my measure.

Once I had the data in a usable form, I used Tableau to create the visualization. If you would like to alter or adjust the visualization, you can download the workbook using the toolbar below the visualization. </TEXT>

Tool: Tableau 

Last year, I created a graphic showing the number of Americans married last year by age using data published by the American Community Survey. Since then, new data has been published for the Census Bureau so I updated my initial visualization.

I used the 2015 One Year Estimates Public Use Microdata Sample to create this visualization. The data can be found on the ACS Website. I then utilized Tableau to visualize the data. This newer version allows you to break down the results by the number of times someone is married. You can look at the proportions of that total

<TEXT> A few weeks ago, I created a [visualization on how home value compares to income in each US county](http://overflow.solutions/demographic-data/how-home-value-compares-to-income-in-the-us/). That visualization mapped the data so I could see the geographic trends. It looked like all the places with higher ratios were focused around metro area so I made this visualization. It shows the ratio for the number of years worth of median income it would take to equal the median value of homes in that metro area.The dataviz starts by showing the 25 metro areas with the largest populations, but the filters can be used to adjust it.

To create this data visualization I gathered data from the American Community Survey. I used the 2015 ACS 1 years estimates from Table B25064, B25077, and B25071 on American FactFinder. I then manipulated the data in excel and used Tableau to visualize the data. If you are interested in the data used for this visualization you can find more data like it in [my post the compare these points on a scatter plot.](http://overflow.solutions/demographic-data/how-does-income-compare-to-home-value-in-u-s-metro-areas/) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Last year, I created a graphic showing the marital status of Americans by age using data published by the American Community Survey. Since then, new data has been published for the Census Bureau so I updated my initial visualization.

I used the 2015 One Year Estimates Public Use Microdata Sample to create this visualization. The data can be found on the ACS Website. I then utilized Tableau to visualize the data. If you are interested in more data like this be sure to check out my How Americans Differ by Age dataviz. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was interested in seeing if there was a good source for predicting the Super Bowl winner. I figured that the Vegas line would be a good source. While the spread is used to make betting more interesting, I thought all the work that goes into it would make it a good source for determining a projected winner. As you can see, it isnt always right, but it doesnt do a bad job.

There is some good news for Falcons fans though. Even though the Patriots are the current favorite by 3.5, when the spread is that small, the favorite has only won 8 out of 15 times. That goes down to 7 and 14 if you take away the toss up game between Seattle and New England that we gave to Vegas as a gimme.

To create this visualization, I gathered information on who the favorite was to win the Super Bowl from Wikipedia. I used Excel to enter the data and Tableau to create the visualization. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wanted to create a visualization showing the time that Americans say they arrive at their work place, so I gathered data from the American Community Survey. I used Tableau to create the visualization and excel to help me with some of the data editing. The data comes from the 2015 ACS 1 Year Public Use Microdata Sample which can be found on the ACS Website..

I decided to use ACS PUMS instead of the published data tables because the published tables have unequal time intervals that I think are meant to show fairly similar group sizes. The PUMS data though has this variable broken out into 5 minute time intervals except for three instances where it is a 10 minute interval. I went ahead and combined the data into 15 minute intervals using the Tableaus calculated field option, some excel functions, and the ACS PUMS Data Dictionary. I also did some work with some other variables so that you can filter the data by state of residency, sex, and the class of worker. The result of this work is shown in the visualization.

That is when I decided to make this graphic which shows the differences.
I used American Community Survey data which is compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau for my dataset. I gathered the 2011-2015 estimates from Table B01001 which can be found at American FactFinder. I then used Tableau to create the visualization. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was inspired by u/iturki27's post of the "Worldwide Human Sex Ratio" to create one of the states and counties in the Continental U.S. I used American Community Survey Data which is compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau. I gathered the 2011-2015 estimates from Table B01001 which can be found at American FactFinder. I then used Tableau to create the visualization.

Edit: I created an [interactive version](http://overflow.solutions/demographic-data/what-is-the-the-sex-ratio-of-each-state-and-county-in-the-u-s/) that lets you look at the rate by age group and filter down by state. There are also tool tips which explain the dot size so hopefully that helps clarify the confusion about the size of the dots. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Last week, I created a graphic showing the age at which woman gave birth according to the data published by the American Community Survey. I decided to create another visualization that shows how it differs by marital status. I did this using my initial visualization and splitting it into two groups, those that are currently married and another I classified as single which includes woman that are widowed, separated, divorced, and have never married.
I used the 2015 One Year Estimates Public Use Microdata Sample to create this visualization. The data can be found on the ACS Website. I then utilized Tableau to visualize the data. </TEXT>

Its worth mentioning that this is not representative of the woman that gave birth in the last 12 months from today, or even 2015. The question which is shown in the post asks this question.

<TEXT> I'm going to have to quibble with you on it being useless on mobile. I was able to find [San Francisco](http://i.imgur.com/F6lzJqY.png) quickly by just clicking on the points. Then again I am the creator so my opinion is 100% biased

As for the median rent, the Census Bureau reports that the median rent is around 1,500. I know there have been a lot of stories about the rent being that high lately, and I can't say how they come to that number.

I can tell you though that this data is from a five year sample so that could have something to do with it. It also includes all household sizes so maybe there are a lot of studios that bring down the number. Finally, it is self reported data, maybe a lot of people only report their portion of the rent when they should be reporting it for the whole household. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ill admit, I was a little confused by this as well. These are three separate variables that the Census Bureau publishes so that likely has something to do with it. The best explanation I could find was from socialexplorer.com.

"This measure divides the gross rent as a percentage of household income distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median gross rent as a percentage of household income and one- half above the median. Median gross rent as a percentage of household income is computed on the basis of a standard distribution. (See the "Standard Distributions" section in Appendix A.) Median gross rent as a percentage of household income is rounded to the nearest tenth. (For more information on medians, see "Derived Measures.")"

It doesn't say much, but it has got to be something about how they calculate it. </TEXT>

The best way I could figure out to do this was to use data from the American Community Survey. This Census Bureau program collects data that can be used to look into how many times people of certain age group get married. I used the 2015 One Year Estimates Public Use Microdata Sample, which can be found on the ACS Website. I then used Tableau to visualize the data. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The U.S. Census Bureau recently reported that the American Community Survey (ACS) estimates that 9.4% of Americans dont have health insurance coverage. This is an all time low because of the passage of the ACA. Like other statistics though, different groups have a different percentage of people that are uninsured. This visualization lets you explore the number of people that are uninsured for a number of different populations.
To create this data visualization I gathered data from the ACS on American Fact Finder. I used Table B27001 from 2010 to 2015. I then used Tableau to visualize the data.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> After completing a post on the unemployment rate in each state, u/Kotebiya asked I publish the interactive tool to explore the data. This tool lets you see the unemployment rate in each county, state, division, and region in the US for the last 26 years. I used the latest 2015 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to make this visualization. The data was cleaned in Excel and then Tableau was used to create the timeline. The data published by BLS is the average unemployment rate for the year. I then strung them together to make the timeline. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Given the size of mobile screens and the differences in them, no, i don't think that it is possible for the whole visualization to fit. When you look at most screen sizes the bar chart does fit in the full screen which is what I think is most important.  As for the advertising I think there is an appropriate amount and haven't heard any other complaints.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nope, Tableau Public is free. There is a row limit and a space limit, but you have to have a farily large data set to run against them. The row limit is around 25 million I think and the total space is like 10gbs but Tableau puts the data in their format so it is fairly small.

No problem. I really appreciate the advice I get in r/dataisbeautiful so I always try to respond when I can.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah I get what your saying. I think it may have to do with legality across states. While some states you have certain labor laws that allow this, in other states it isn't legal.

<TEXT> The way the Census currently asks this question they ask for whether or not you have Hispanic origins and then ask your race. They do it this way because there used to be more of a distinction, but people don't look at it that way anymore. If you are interested in learning more about changes to this [Pew published a story about it](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/06/18/census-considers-new-approach-to-asking-about-race-by-not-using-the-term-at-all/).

Since the data is collected this way it is tough to create a visualization that incorporates this. That is why I have a Hispanic filter on the visualization, but it is not worked into the race variable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Over the last few months, I have done some work creating various age distributions that show different demographic traits. I wanted to create something though that was able to show age distributions with multiple demographic traits all in one place. This graphic is my attempt at making this tool.

In the data visualization above you are able to take various demographic traits and apply them to the population pyramid of the U.S. You can then use the filters below to adjust the pyramid to only show certain populations. If you want the visual to only show one characteristic or exclude a trait, simply click it in the legend and keep or remove it.

The data for this tool comes from the Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) published by the American Community Survey.  It then utilizes Tableau to display the data.You can find information about the ACS PUMS at the Census Bureaus website. On the site there is information about the survey, summary level data, and how to use the PUMS data.

I plan on updating this tool throughout the year. If there are any traits that you are interested in seeing, let me know and I would be happy to set it up. Also, since this is an ongoing project, any suggestions you have on how to make the visualization better are welcome.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For this visualization I categorized people 15 to 34 years old are as Millennials. I found that almost 27% of people in the US fall into this age group. While Most states did not significantly differ from this I found that their were a lot of variation in the counties, especially smaller counties. This visualization lets you explore that with the ability to filter by gender and highlight by geography.The data used in this visualization is compiled by the US Census Bureau. I used Table PEPAGESEX from American FactFinder to determine population counts by age. Once I had the data and the age groups I was going to use, I cleaned the data with Excel and used Tableau to create the visualization.

In addition to using Tableau and Excel, the website Codepen is used to host custom CSS and JS coding. The idea to do this came from Ben Sullins website. In a recent blog post, he explains how to use this coding and Tableau to create 50 state maps. I used this same idea to create the maps for how many Millennials are in each states.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> ABC News recently published a story where they detailed the various laws and statements from government officials about taking pictures of your ballot. I decided that this story would be a cool data visualization.

To make the visualization I went through the article and assigned each state a status as well as copied the quote from the article about this status. This was done in excel. I then used Tableau to create this data visualization. The hexagon map is something that I came across that on Sir Viz-A-Lots blog. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The idea for this post came from one I completed a few months ago about what the unemployment rate has been in each county in the US for the last 25 years. I used this data and the latest 2015 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to make this visualization. The data was cleaned in Excel and then Tableau was used to create the timeline. The data published by BLS is the average unemployment rate for the year. I then strung them together to make the timeline.

In addition to using Tableau and Excel, the website Codepen is used to host custom CSS and JS coding. The idea to do this came from Ben Sullins website. In a recent blog post, he explains how to use this coding and Tableau to create 50 state maps. I used this same idea to create timelines for each states unemeployment rate. Be sure to check out his site for more great ideas on using Tableau, CSS, and JS. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ABC News recently published a story where they detailed the various laws and statements from government officials about taking pictures of your ballot. I decided that this story would be a cool data visualization.

To make the visualization I went through the article and assigned each state a status as well as copied the quote from the article about this status. This was done in excel. I then used Tableau to create this data visualization. The hexagon map is something that I came across that on Sir Viz-A-Lots blog. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that you are right that if you use too many filters it can get too small to make sense. I just think it is better to provide users with the entire interface and let them decide what makes sense and what is drilling in too far.

I can't think of a way to allow to drill in for each of the variables without presenting them all. I am also looking into ways to improve this for future visualizations such as including margin of error or using the 5 year ACS dataset.

<TEXT> The data for this visualization comes from the American Community Survey which is completed by the US Census Bureau. I used the 2014 One Year Estimates Public Use Microdata Sample which can be found on the ACS Website.

The visualization takes advantage of the numerous amounts of data collected by the ACS. You are able to look at an age group comparison of nine different demographic traits. you can also look at the data by state. </TEXT>

For this question, respondents have 5 responses that they can choose from. Only respondents that are 15 years or older have there responses tallied in this total. Since the question is set up this way it is worth pointing out that this likely is only individuals that current relationship status is divorced. If someone was divorced, but remarried, they would likely choose to say that they were married. A screenshot of the question has been included in the post </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I realized it wasn't something interacting with the Census in Tableau I started researching it a little more. This tool you have is amazing. You did a really great job with it.

I understand how the API works, but had no idea how to create a program that could pull it straight in.I was resorting to using the API to create excel files. Which isn't much of an improvement off American Fact Finder. Using this WDC is much better than anything I have been using.

I will definitely reach out to you in the future. I plan on using this with some of the data visualization I create. I want to make sure to give you credit and point people towards your blog for creating this awesome tool.

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tableau is pretty cool, but you are right there is a learning curve. I really don't do much data manipulation in it though. The only time I do is when it is something I will be coming back to. It uses an sql type language which isn't tough, but it doesn't do anything to the original data. all the data manipulations apply to tableau. 

I will say though that I find the tableau interface much more intuitive than the excel graphics and easier to manage.

The visualization groups individuals into 3 groups: those who arent at a different address than the one they had 12 months, those who have moved within the country to a new address 12 months ago, and those who have moved from another country 12 months ago. Children that are under 12 months old are not included in the data because they hadnt been born a year ago. A picture of the survey question has been included in the post. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So the Census looks at Hispanic as an origin and not a race. I was thinking about that yesterday as I was developing this and I will prob find a way to work it in in future visualizations, but I wasn't able to here. 

[Here is some more information about the way the census approaches Hispanic Origin.](http://www.census.gov/population/hispanic/) </TEXT>

<TEXT>  It would be cool to see this broken down by gender

I'm guessing you saw the mobile version. Be sure to come back on your desktop when you have a chance. There is a gender filter that you can use to play with the data. Tableau, just isn't as mobile friendly so I only include the static image. 

Thanks for your insight!

<TEXT> A few months ago I created a visualization that allowed users to compare age distributions for various topics and another one that showed marital status by age range. I decided that I wanted to take a closer look at marital status and I thought this tool would give me a good base to start from. This visualization uses Tableau to show the marital status for every age.

The data for this visualization comes from the American Community Survey which is completed by the US Census Bureau. I used the 2014 One Year Estimates Public Use Microdata Sample which can be found on the ACS Website. In the post, I have provided examples of the questions that are asked to create this data. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The data for this visualization comes from the American Community Survey which is conducted by the US Census Bureau. The data was downloaded from [American Fact Finder](http://factfinder.census.gov/). It is found under Table S2701, of the 2014 1 Year Estimates. It is important to note that the numbers do not total to the population because a person can have more than 1 type of insurance.

After the data was acquired, it was cleaned in excel. The visualization was then created in Tableau.

<TEXT> I was surprised at first too, but when I started looking at some of the data for it state it started to make sense. 

That states with higher "wireless only" numbers are states with younger median ages and states where there is more poverty.  I would guess younger people are more likely to have mobile only and more impoverished people are most likely getting subsidies for wireless phones that they can't get for landlines. 

In the Northeast you have a wealthier and older population. They are more likely to be able to afford both or because they are older they just have the landline. 

That's my guess only using basic demographic assumptions. </TEXT>

I think that this exists though at least in the mind of some reporters. It may even help add fuel to the fire that more profit driven members of the MSM are hoping for.

I am curious about some of the results, especially with Mormons. It is weird that Mormons are so accepting of animal cloning, but not cloning humans. My guess is that it has to do with the fact that Mormons believe some people will eventually be given the power to create life, but I am wondering if methodology may be swaying the numbers.

If this is just a simple yes no than that result is the result, but if it is done with a likert scale there may be a story this visualization doesn't show. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Facebook portrays trending as a computer modeling of what is going on in the world. We know now that it isn't the case now.

If people found out that Facebook was suppressing Bernie Sanders stories, this would be the most upvoted story on reddit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am not exactly sure why this is. My theory is that it is a weighting issue with the public microdata that the Census provides. 

Since their are privacy concerns, the Census only provides a partial sample of the data they collect in the micro data. They then apply a weight to each case so you can create national estimates. With small groups though there are issues with that though. Small groups can have issues where the estimate does not reflect what is actually occurring. I am sure the census tests some groups to make sure they are extremely accurate, but I don't think they looked at the population of 94 year olds.  

Since I am not certain about it I decided to go ahead and publish the visualization as is.

<TEXT> Edit: I posted this but I think it wasn't sent as a reply. If it was my bad.

I called it a custom tab because I put it together using the 10 years of ACS data so it doesn't match exactly because the PUMs data isn't an exact replica of ACS data. You can't see all ten years of data because of the tableau public row limit though. I didn't use the tables because I find it a pain to combine each year now that I have them combined Housing PUMs.

 I do have some SAS experience and that is what initially turned me on to WPS. I have only used it for about three weeks because it's a trial, but it seems to get the job done. It seems like their are some project options that are better than SAS if you want to do a large project, but I haven't gotten a chance to explore them.

My biggest complaint is the performance time and the cost. It seems to run a lot slower than SAS. That may be my computers fault compared to what I have at work. The cost I got quoted was 1300 ish a year which wouldn't be bad if I was trying to replace SAS, but for my on the side data visuals there is no way I can afford that.

<TEXT> It's nicer, but they aren't as mutually exclusive as you would think. Lodi separates itself from Stockton by maintaining "greenbelt" compriesed of farmland and the zoo. What ends up happening though is that Lodi doesn't have very much recreation or large businesses so you have to go to Stockton. Also, the community college is in Stockton so you either have to drive or make a bus trip that is nearly undo-able due to the length and regularity of the bus system. Crime from Stockton has started to creep up into Lodi.

TLDR: Lodi is a lot nicer than Stockton, but they aren't as separated as you would think. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well if you want the data here it is...

Median Household Income 

US Average - $53,482

White - $56,900

Black or African American - $35,600

American Indian and Alaska Native $37,170

Asian - $73,244

Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander - $53,370

Some other race - $40,300

Two or more races - $47,621

Hispanic or Latino - $42,396

I'm too lazy to write up all the educational attainment info for each race because it is on different data tables, but 18.3% of the total population has a bachelor's degree and 11% has a graduate degree. About 29.7% of Asian Americans have a bachelor's degree and 21.8% have earned a graduate or professional degree
All of this data is published by the US Census Bureau on americanfactfinder.gov . The income info is on Table S1903 and the educational data is table B15002d and S1501.

<TEXT> If the GOP had half a brain they could pick some one else and then explain that Trump and Cruz had no chance of beating HRC. 

But I think can see your argument. The RNC may just decide it is better to lose this one then to fracture a portion of their party off into another one.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are exactly right u/rakajj. I am going to try and work on some more data involving the geography that better shows it. This visualization doesn't because I wanted to highlight some of the other characteristics that can have an effect on commute time.

Those are even affected by geography though. Federal workers have the longest commutes, but it is because most are located in DC. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for asking u/billclintonsbrother those questions. 

So the survey is a household based survey so all the data is coded where a person lives. So like what you were saying about DC. Commute times inside DC won't seem as long even though the commutes from the surrounding counties are some of the longest in the nation.

I started to play with the county data last night and it does a much better job of showing some of the geographical trends that you were mentioning. I didn't do that with this because the county data isn't available and it could be a visualization all on its own.

When I finish up the geographical look I would be happy to send it to you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I support the petition and am willing to say that to other members of the Lds church. I don't want to sign it because I don't want to give the website my street address. 

I don't know about the particulars of what is happening here, but I do believe the honor code office shouldn't get involved. It's more important that rape victims report the crime than knit picking the honor code.  A church the cherishes eternal justice should be ok with it some people abuse this clause since the cases that it is true are so important. 

Ldsbc actually moved to the KSL building on north temple and west temple. It is actually a pretty cool building as well. Just different.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> To gather the data for this visualization I transcribed the data from Wikipedia. I did this in a by year fashion. I used the logic that I would use the governor that was in office for the majority of the year to code that year. In some cases, certain short term or temporary governors were left out, but party control was almost never exchanged in this instance.

After transcribing the data, Microsoft Excel and Tableau were used to create this visualization. If you have any questions go ahead and leave me a comment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just a tip I have like is making the counties into the dots and having the size linked to the population size. It helps give a little more meaning to it. For example LA county has almost a million more people then it did, but counties the gained 10,000 look to have an enormous amount of population growth. Your map shows relative size, but you could show relative and nominal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> o gather the data for this visualization I transcribed the data from Wikipedia. I did this in a by year fashion. I used the logic that I would use the governor that was in office for the majority of the year to code that year. In some cases, certain short term or temporary governors were left out, but party control was almost never exchanged in this instance.

After transcribing the data, Microsoft Excel and Tableau were used to create this visualization. If you have any questions go ahead and leave me a comment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This definitely true about the unemployment statistic that is quoted in the news each month. This data is a little different though in the fact that it does not rely only on immediate data. It uses a few sources to pull it together. You can some of the [info here].(http://www.bls.gov/lau/lauov.htm)

You are definitely right though about it not being a perfect statistic. From what I can tell this does nothing to show underemployment which is important. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't want to give the custody of every unborn child to the US government. I never said that and your making a broad assumption. In the case of a mother that wants to have an abortion, she is no longer acting in the interest of the child. That is why the government has some right to become involved. They would do the same if a child was being abused.

Again, their you go dabbling in slippery slope arguments that have no baring on what is occurring here with your talk about euthanasia.

<TEXT> The reason it become a political issue is at what point does a fetus become a human and have rights that a supposed to be protected by the government.

The biggest issue is that people don't agree on when this change occurs. I believe it is early than most of the people here do it would seem.

I will concede that republicans do a horrible job of making this argument. They fall into the easy(/stupid) fallacy that everyone should believe their religion knows best. 

They should instead focus on pointing out that science shows that their are certain milestones that even a fetus goes through and that at some point it  becomes a person and has rights. Science shows that this point seems to be getting earlier than we used to believe. </TEXT>

If he can win next week that would be awesome and he could win the whole thing or at least broker the convention. I just don't know if it could happen. 

The only way I see him staying in after next week if he loses is to try and win California. I think he has the best shot their and I think that would give him some sway. I just don't know how his campaign sees it. </TEXT>
