<TEXT> I thought that since it talks about mythological topics and the such, it would have some relatable territory to Rick Riordan. Except it being for adults rather than kids, for instance your example. But I'm pretty sure from these responses I was wrong. However I think that I might be able to sneak this by them though. I just won't bring up the vagina monster. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been wanting to read the book by Neil Gaiman, but my parents are very religious. They believe that the book is sort of anti religious towards Christianity. When I was younger I read the Percy Jackson series, and they seemed fine with that. If these two series are similar, then I'm pretty sure they'll let me read it. If you have read from both of these series, could you give me your opinion? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This may seem like a stupid question but the reason I'm asking is because I recommended a cool shirt design that got approved by upper management. The only problem with it was that it wasn't professional enough. When I came up with the idea I thought of something trendy that not just employees were forced to wear, but also something that customers might want to purchase for themselves (kind of like Torchy's Tacos). Everyone that has seen it says that they would wear it, but now I won't be put through because it's unprofessional (in other words doesn't have a collar and is made with Cotten instead of polyester). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello everyone, I asked this question in a different sub, but it's probably better for this sub Reddit. Recently I have been invited to a LAN party. I'm able to go but I'm currently having issues with my hardware. Unfortunately I can only play a selected amount of games. My question is which would you rather choose, Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen or Rise of the Tomb Raider? Thanks for the reading and possibly replying. </TEXT>
