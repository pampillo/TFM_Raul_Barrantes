<TEXT> Ya that actually makes me suspicious. Bots dont do things they arent programmed to do. Why would this bot be accepting mod invites from random subs? And then suddenly remove themselves. Apprentice bot might not be just a bot... </TEXT>

<TEXT> The first post is from a user added on the first night. He didnt speak english very well so he didnt really participate. I checked his post history at one point and he exclusively posted in /r/newsokur. Im guessing that post is him explaining to his friends what happened.

The next two are my posts. Night Mind is a youtuber I watch who specializes in investigating creepy stuff. He doesnt have the most active sub but i thought it was worth a shot to post it there. 

The /r/creepy thread is probably what got me purged since it got some moderate attention. I recommend checking the comments on that post. There are a few people whove had similar experiences to us. Theres at least a couple "purging" subs according to them.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> If it resonates with you then power to you my friend! Its your art after all :)

 I see what you were going for now that you mention it. I actually have similar experiences as a kid. Just curling up into a ball transfixed at some scary story. Too scared to do anything but stare.

Personally, I still think you could exaggerate that pose a little more. Really sell that hes transfixed by the story. But you know what that's so nitpicky at this point that im just gonna chalk it up to differences in approach lol

Your art is fantastic and nothing i said should detract from that!   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really love this piece! The story is great, the atmoshpere is amazing. 

I have an extremely minor critique though. I would try to exagerate the kids reaction a bit more. Hes pretty static and boxy and really doesnt look like hes responding to the dad. 

 A story is told through action and reaction. Often reactions tell us more about the action then the action itself does. How the child reacts to the story the dad is telling is how your audience infers what the story is about. If he is excited we may infer its a happy story, if hes acting scared we'll more likely infer that its a scary story. 

Its very minor in the grand scheme of your work (i love all the little details in this piece) but i think keeping reaction in mind when trying to tell a story would go a long way!     </TEXT>

Story:
On Tuesday, May 2nd, around 12:00 am I recieved a message that i had become an approved poster on a subreddit called /r/vZEk9sCzqbi154p. The message: http://imgur.com/a/Gbyjq

Intrigued, i followed the link and it led me to a freshly made subreddit. There were only 4-5 posts on there total. Two of which were stickied posts from the admin, a user named /u/ApprenticeBot. The two stickied posts looked like this: http://imgur.com/a/2d6lP

I was more than curious at this point. Some of the later users likened it to the beginning of a horror movie and i definitely got that vibe too. Every user had a number from 1-25 flaired to their account. I was #19 in the beginning.

I commented on one of the posts and made my own trying to find out some more info. Only text posts are allowed and there are no rules to posting. Only a couple users were active. So i didn't really get any answers. I decided to check back later.

I check back in an hour and the stickied posts have changed: http://imgur.com/a/wBky7

There were 19 added and purged when i was approved. There were 13 after that purge. It looked like the remaining users list jumped from 6 to 12 as well.

A select few users continued making periodic posts. Mostly shitposting, speculating, and jokes. The stuff you expect to get when you give a bunch of random users control of a sub with no direction.

The third purge came an hour after the second. Sometime around the third purge I compiled my observations into this post: http://imgur.com/a/wazzm

Any user who posted as much as one comment is added to the remaining users list and survives the purges. Users who do not post anything are removed in an hour. New users are added at the same time as others are purged. This system ran like clockwork for 12 hours straight. The few active users and I kept glued to the screen. There were maybe 4-5 people making random posts and comments hoping not to be purged. Waiting to see what would happened when all 25 slots were taken up. Some examples of the posts: http://imgur.com/a/BXCTE

Well by around noon the next day we had our 25 users. I was now number #11. Users who are purged lose their spot and the remaining users get their numbers moved up to the next highest available slot. I waited anxiously until the next hour to see if we would finally learn what this is about. The time came and the current stickies were removed and replaced with one that read: http://imgur.com/a/L6hNM

So absolutely no answers. Great. These non-purges continued for another 12 hours. Each one the exact same message but still different posts. As the 24 hour mark inched closer i predicted there would be a purge of non-active users. 

Midnight came, marking 24 hours of the subs existence. And no change at all. The last sticky post just stayed up and continued to be up for 6+ hours. No other sticky had been up for over an hour up until now. Eventually the purge came, and it removed all users who hadn't posted in over 24 hours. I checked each of their accounts to verify.

Hourly purges began again for a little bit, recycling a lot of acounts. Right now it's acting a little weird, the list of purged users has been up for 6 hours, whereas a single new user was added two hours ago. I'm not sure what that means.

Basically thats all I know so far. The subs really quiet right now, nobodies quite sure what to do. I'm currently #4. Some users theorize that the sub is a sort of social experiment. One posited that this could be one of many such subreddits. I think it could just be somebody testing a bot of some sort. Either way nobody really knows why this sub exists.

If anyone out there has cryptographic experience, I'd really like to know if the title of the subreddit is just jibberish or if it could potentially have meaning.

I hope you guys found that intriguing. If you like this post i will provide updates if and when there are any. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know a guy like this too. Ive never personally seen his antics but i have a mutual friend who told me some stories and showed me some of the aftermath. Apparently, every weekend he would go out to bars and start shit with random people. Usually with bigger guys, often while piss drunk, and almost always for very little reason. Sometimes he would win, other times he would lose terribly. Hes been knocked out mulitiple times, hes broken teeth, he roped one of his friends into it who ended up suffering a pretty bad knockout. 

The guy wasnt dissuaded by any of the loses though. He couldnt help himself i guess. Anyway, he did his usual shit one weekend. Picked a fight with some dude over nothing. Except this time someone called the cops on him. 

Now perhaps your thinking that this was the wake up call he needed. Maybe this time he'll realize things had gone too far. Surely one would at least question themselves at this point. 

Nope. He tried to fight the cops and assaulted them. 

Hes got a few felonies hanging over his head now. Plus the cops didnt take too kindly to getting assaulted so he got fucked up as well. As far as i know he doesnt start as many fights now. So maybe it was what needed to happen unfortunately. I still dont think ill ever understand the thought proccess (or lack thereof) behind these people.  </TEXT>

It would be pretty hard to get a conviction out of this even if the statute of limitations wasnt up (which it might not be depending on the state this occured in). Even if she says she did it in her book, she can say she was lying or made it up for publicity, and it would be the prosecuters job to prove that the incident even took place.  </TEXT>

My message i guess is that life hasnt given up on you. Regardless of where youve been its never too late to create something wonderful. I hope these 35 days leads you to a lifetime of happiness. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know they can replace certain parts of the skull with 3d printed implants. A youtuber i watch recently had a new forehead put in after a terrible bmx accident. His original frontal bone was removed surgically however, so it was a way more straight forward procdeure. No idea if they can do something similar here with that level of damage. There have also been fairly successful face transplants so that might be an option (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2121185/Richard-Lee-Norris-face-transplant-Gun-accident-victim-given-amazing-operation-US-doctors.html) 

The least they could do would be to pinch the hole closed like the before picture in that article. Though, that seems easier said then done </TEXT>

<TEXT> I believe this falls into the category of felony* murder. Basically felony* murder means you are responsible for any deaths that occur as the result of you commiting a crime. Doesn't matter if they are accidental, or if the person was involved or not. Intent doesn't actually play into it as far as i know, because its a technical charge separate to a regular murder charge.        </TEXT>

<TEXT> I watched an interesting piece about alcohol smuggling in Nunavut from Vice (if I'm remembering right). The sale of alcohol is banned in a few communities up there and requires direct permission from a committee in others. So naturally people have taken to smuggling alcohol into these communities for profit. The demand coupled with the already high cost of getting goods makes it so cheap smuggled alcohol can sell for over $600 a bottle. </TEXT>

So every good looking, fit, well dressed guy is automatically a douchebag asshole to him. Regardless of whether he knows them or not. Or if they're good people. His criteria is simply "look at him, he looks like an asshole" when all these guys have done is taken better care of themselves than he has. 

It's pretty sad because if a guy is doing better than you its time to take notes. Not try to cut him down to your standard.

I get protests are supposed to inconvenience people and I'm probably more sympathetic than I should be sometimes (vehemently disagree with blocking a highway/ambulance though). But how the hell is anyone who gets stopped by this or sees it in the news going to be sympathetic when the leader doesn't even think it's worth really fighting for.

<TEXT> Watching something like The First 48 really made me realize how much old school detective work goes into solving murders. If there aren't great witnesses and no motive within the people that know the victim, it can be almost impossible to get a lead. Cicumstantial evidence only goes so far in some cases. 

From what I remember though, truly random murders are relatively rare. Not every case that goes unsolved means it was committed by an unmotivated stranger, lack of evidence can play a big part as well.  </TEXT>

For his wife had his balls affixed to a chain 

And cry as he might, at any perceived slight 

She would never release his manhood 



Now Growing blue from the build up of splooge

It drew Steve of shives into madness anew 

Throwing his world into a feminist stew 

Where his only release is banning all but a few 



This is where Steve is resigned to stay 

Living out the remaining dregs of his days 

And what more else is there to possibly say? 

His wife gets fucked while he watches in vain   </TEXT>

<TEXT> My experience (which is just as valid as pauls) is that it's largely personality driven. In my elementary school the kid who got picked on the most was a scrawny weird kind of kid. He wasn't a pussy but he was kind of small and had a lot of anti-social behaviour which means he was easy picking for bullies.The biggest bully in the school? Some fat kid a year above me with a gaggle of smaller friends. They would pick on anyone they could get away with. He was just a mean guy and the mean guys gravitated together to pick on people.


So in my experience bullies just bully anyone for anything they can. You aren't special because you got bullied over being fat, no more than I'm special for being bullied about my parents divorce. You also can't say that any fat person was bullied. It's just as likely that they could be the bully (if we're going by anecdotes).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Insurance contracts generally have a common clause called a force majeure clause. This removes liability from both parties in the event of an extraordinary event or circumstance outside of either parties control. Things like riots, war, strikes, or "acts of god" like hurricanes, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions. Generally these clauses don't entirely remove the obligation of either party to fulfill the agreement. Only suspend it until the event is over.

Your specific contract will likely have one of these clauses but the level to which liability is diminished can vary. Read your contract if you're curious, it probably has some force majeure provisions.  

IANAL btw.    </TEXT>

If its a close friend then i would suggest starting a dialogue. Maybe try to figure out what they like about the comic. It could be that this is the only one they've seen and they just liked it. Or they could be a big fan but perhaps an outside perspective may make them question the comics messages. You know the person better than me so you'll have to figure out the best way to approach this, and determine whether or not they'll be receptive to your opinion. If that's what you decide to do. 


If it's just an aquaintance then the hassle probably isn't worth getting into. Let them share their shit and move on. Or troll them. Your choice honestly.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hospitals are obligated to save your life if you are going to die regardless of your ability to pay. At least in emergency situations. Even in the US. If someone shows up at the ER with life threatening injuries or some life threatening medical condition (heart attack, pneumonia, etc) the hospital has to get you into a stable condition. Insurance is only brought up after the fact.

<TEXT> I actually experienced this situation unfortunately. Two of my cats were brothers, same situation as yours, never been apart before and they were very close to each other. A little over a year ago one of them was hit by a car and was dead by the time we found him. 

The surviving brother was pretty distraught for a bit. I'm fairly certain he knew his brother was dead because he never really went looking for him. He was just kind of lost and depressed for a couple weeks. He would wander the house meowing, calling out for someone, not sure what to do. My family and i supported him a lot during that time and made sure he knew he was well loved and that we were there for him. Today he's still the same playful/affectionate cat he was before. Every now and then though, I feel like I need to pick him up and let him know it's all OK and that he's not alone. 

I hope your cats have long healthy lives my friend. It really does suck when they go. 

RIP Summer, we're taking good care of your brother little buddy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally I think if you're going to have the death sentence it should have the strictest criteria possible to prevent innocent deaths. To me that would mean both a unanimous jury decision and judge approval and if both can't be met they get life. I don't like the idea of a judge unilaterally being able to sentence you to death, its too much power for one person in my opinion. I'm not even a US citizen though so my opinion might not count for much.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My understanding is at that point they just treat the symptoms individually because a primary cause can't be established. Pain meds for pain, seizure meds for seizures, etc. So the treatment can work in that it can relieve symptoms and make it easier to deal with but it doesn't work in that it will cure or stop the problem entirely because the underlying issue is unknown. 

Not a doctor, but have some personal experience with chronic illness for what that's worth.  </TEXT>

You've given me a lot to think about here and I appreciate that. I'm already questioning my relationship with alcohol and I'm not sure what to make of it. So far I've struck what I think is a decent balance but how long will that last? I don't have any of the symptoms you listed, but it does feel like playing with fire a bit. I've got a lot of thinking to do about this it seems.

<TEXT> Glad to hear that you're beating it! Both my parents are former alcoholics and they've been sober for 25+ years each now. 

I'm just curious as to what the early warning signs of alcoholism are? If there are any. Since it runs in my family I'm a little worried that I might be predisposed to it (if that's possible). So far I only drink on the weekends and I don't have trouble managing it but I know that's how a lot of people start out. So are there any signs or symptoms I should be watching out for? </TEXT>

<TEXT> If men go to prison when they're actually the victim, "they can handle it better" than if even one woman is falsely accused.

So men are tougher than women and therefore not complete equals? Women are too weak to handle prison but men are strong and capable and will handle it better? 

Interesting how the sexism goes full circle whenever it benefits them.

Only problem I can think of at the moment is that anyone with any in-depth knowledge of the situation would be incriminating themselves to a certain degree by coming foreward. The peasants could offer immunity from a civil suit as well as cash to balance that. Not sure what would happen if the courts decide to pursue criminal charges though. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  *If* the politics pushed at these institutions objectively prevent them from effectively doing their jobs

My only sticking point is that "if", i guess. Has anyone proved that, let's say a business graduate, from one of these places is objectively worse at their job? 

I do agree that a "be aware this is what goes on at this university" type message to HR would be fine though. I was more against instantly throwing the resumes out if they even had anything to do with feminism or SJW'S, like the OP had suggested. Not even meeting the person face to face just throwing out their resume because they might have some opinions that are aggravating. In that scenario they don't even try to see if the person shits where they eat. 

I'll fully admit that it may not be practical to vet every candidate this way. It would be far more cost effective to tell them to kick rocks. My opposition is largely a philosophical one stemming from the source of this thread. Which is us getting angry at an institution for banning someone for their ideas. While we call for bans on people from certain schools and who hold certain ideas. It really should be okay to do it or not, for everybody, in my opinion. Not just okay when we do it.  

One more thing, hypothetically would a liberal leaning company be in the right for banning conservatives or anyone who comes from a conservative leaning school?

<TEXT> But we don't punish those who may have went to the same school as kidnappers and we don't punish those who have the same opinions as them either. We punish people who have actually committed acts or crimes. 

I said in another comment that I'm probably being too philosophical and not pragmatic enough. I just don't think we can really claim to be better than them if we act like them. And if we aren't better than them than where does our authority to judge their acts of exclusion (i.e banning milo) come from? If ours are just as bad, we don't really have ground to say theirs is worse and should be punished.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not really sure where i stand on this because i see your point, and i think as a business operator/owner you should have the right to pick employees that fit your company. I'm not saying that you have to hire crazy SJW's or increase your workforce diversity. Just that a blanket ban or increased scrutiny on anyone who attends certain schools or holds certain opinions seems so similar to what we are against on this sub. It feels anti-meritocratic, that people aren't being judged on their ability to do the job but on their opinions. 

Perhaps I'm being too philosophical and not pragmatic enough but the concept irks me the same way banning Milo for his opinion does. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ya I knew a guy who was unbelievably far up his own ass. I hung out with him for a bit and literally everything we did had to revolve around him. He also would only message me if he wanted something and wouldnt respond to my messages unless he felt he could get something out of it.

Stopped talking to him pretty quickly, so did my other friends (we knew him from HS). Kid couldn't understand why people weren't bending over backwards to talk to him. Narcissist men usually end up lonely in my experience.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was working a temp job recently with a guy who got laid off from the oil fields. He was making $85/hr as a general laborer. He blew it all on expensive trips abroad. So when the price of oil dipped, he got laid off and had nothing to show for it. 

Now hes working minimum wage jobs with me and complaining about not having any money. Nice guy in all fairness, and a good worker, but I can't understand how he thought that the oil market would always stay as high as it did. 

Edit: Wasn't trying to imply that travel is an inherent waste of money. The guy described it to me as him wasting his money traveling because he thought he'd always be working at the oil field.

<TEXT> From my understanding a lot of US military equipment nowadays is made regardless of need. There are tanks sitting in depots somewhere in the US that will never see action but were still built because they need to justify the budget.

<TEXT> EDIT: Though perhaps her matching Kylo is still problematic. He was already injured when she dueled him, and it could be argued that his mental instability detracts from his mental force capability, but it's still questionable, I'll admit.

Remember how they showed off Chewbacca's bowcaster? They had multiple small moments of Han using the bowcaster to blast away stormtroopers. One shot was him killing 3-4 with one bolt. I think they did that because they were trying to establish how much damage it can do to the average person. So that later on when Chewbacca uses it to injure Kylo, we know that it's a fatal wound to anyone else. 

IMO that injury was probably meant to be way more damaging than it looked. I don't think they executed it properly though, because it did seem weird that she had that level of ability against him even with the injury. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I find this to be the absolute saddest and most infuriating consequence of the SJ movement.* They've cheapened the terms for racism and sexism. Being called a "racist" doesn't mean shit when it can literally mean anything from "beaten and murdered for having a different skin color" to "this made a rich black person uncomfortable". 

Imagine if "murderer" could also mean "someone looking at me angrily on the subway". How much weight would that term now carry? How useful from a legal or language perspective would this term be? How insane is that SJW's are actively doing this with terms like: "rape", "harassment", "sexist", "oppression", "misogyny", and many others? 

They're actually throwing useful terms under the bus and it's so rage-inducing. 

*Edit: Upon further thought, this is second to false rape claims, as those have more direct and immediate consequences. </TEXT>

If you get a video flagged for copyright u basically have to wait for the claim to lapse (90 days of unmonetization) or get the other party to give up on it. YouTube won't step in unless you make a big enough shitstorm on 
twitter (look up the youtuber "I hate everything" and his situation). An MCN will give you a direct line to YouTube to deal with this stuff quickly, saving the content creator money and time.

<TEXT> I feel that it's like approaching the speed of light in concept. The closer they get towards the heart of masculinity, the less and less it can be influenced sociologically. You can't argue oppression with a y-chromosome, it isn't listening. So they will experience diminishing returns for increased effort the farther along they go down this rabbit hole IMO. 

It should also be noted that repression generally leads to rebellion and i feel that all this push to end masculinity will end in a push in the opposite direction. I don't think the anti-masculinity crowd has any control beyond social shame and if you push men out of society then you lose that control. Basically i'm not worried because in my eye's they are digging their own grave as we speak.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The argument makes a smidgen more sense since it happened in France. The french language is gendered, and in physics most of the forces are masculine words and most of the things that are acted upon are feminine IIRC. So i think it was more of a semantic argument against the use of gendered words, and not an argument against objective reality. 

However, the things they argue about never ceases to amaze me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My mom had the second of our cats declawed when we spayed her (3-4 months old? Not sure, she was a stray, but she was under a year). We got lucky and she still loves us but my mom regrets it and won't do it to any other of our cats. She's a very sweet cat and we spoil the shit out of her. Though, I do feel bad every time i think about what we did to her.

Through a remarriage my family now has 5 cats (used to be 6 :C), and the declawed one isn't even on the bottom wrung of the totem pole. She can't fight back as well but if she's attacked she'll make the most godawful noises, so the others tend to leave her alone.

I guess what i'm getting at is that even if you're lucky and it works out like my cat, it's still a horrible thing to do and if you empathize with your pets at all, you should avoid it. </TEXT>

It's a law of probability not content. It doesn't make the comparison wrong.

Edit: "Godwin's law does not claim to articulate a fallacy; it is instead framed as a memetic tool to reduce the incidence of inappropriate hyperbolic comparisons. "Although deliberately framed as if it were a law of nature or of mathematics, its purpose has always been rhetorical and pedagogical: I wanted folks who glibly compared someone else to Hitler or to Nazis to think a bit harder about the Holocaust", Godwin has written." </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was a similar situation. Chinese workers were brought over, paid about a dollar a day and died very frequently. It wasn't necessarily slavery or indentured servitude but it was extremely dangerous and the workers weren't compensated very well at all. 

Canadian history footnote: The Canadian rail road system is actually partly responsible for Canada entering into confederation. The first railway was built in 1836 but by 1860 the local governments had pretty much run out of money building more. There was also the issue of western Canada being essentially cutoff from the east due to the sheer distance involved (Toronto to Vancouver is ~4,300 Km). So the promises of more regulated funding and an intercontinental railway were used to help unify the separate colonies.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Switzerland has more lax gun laws

I know this doesn't represent all of the US but you can legally buy a gun in Florida with only a drivers license so long as you aren't on public property. No background checks, no notifying the state, no registry, nothing. Just a drivers license and you have a gun. I don't know if you can get more lax than that. Also Florida alone has twice the population of Switzerland, which is one reason it's hard to apply Swiss-style laws to America. 320 million people is a different animal than 8 million people.

<TEXT> "Singer" is not really mutually exclusive from musician, that's kind of like saying "he's not a musician, he's a guitarist". Singer refers to his instrumentation, musician refers to his career.

The definition of musician is "a person who makes music a profession, especially as a performer of music." ([source](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/musician)) So even if Nicki Minaj had no hand in writing anything, by virtue of her career as performing music, she is by definition a musician. 

I also edited my earlier comment to highlight some things.

[Songs Recorded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_recorded_by_Frank_Sinatra)

[Songs Written or Co-written](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Songs_written_by_Frank_Sinatra)

Out of 1200 released commercial recordings, he had a hand in writing 7.

edit: Funny enough Nicki Minaj has written or co-written 99 of her own tracks https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Songs_written_by_Nicki_Minaj

By this standard Nicki Minaj has more of a claim to musicianship than Frank Sinatra.

Also wouldn't something like the London Philharmonic Orchestra not be musicians then because they largely play classical pieces written by someone else? </TEXT>

Though that doesn't help if you get pulled over somewhere secluded or something. Plus in some places you can't record without permission, for example California bans audio recordings without consent IIRC. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We may be using the word "animal" differently. Perhaps a more accurate word is "monster"? I'm using animal as a scientific classification, we are included in that. So we are animals, even just technically. Honestly though, i think we agree each other, i'm just kind of being pedantic and insisting on technicalities. 

I agree that we should strive for betterment, and continue to learn how to control our instincts. But i think we need to at least acknowledge that they are present as a motivating factor. We still want the same things instinctively that we did 200,000 years ago but the way we're allowed to express those instincts is radically different. It does us no favors to deny what is there. I think we're really going to have to work at it but i also think we're capable.

"Maybe we are still animals, maybe we do not deserve what we have made for ourselves. I have to believe, however that what we have made for ourselves, what we have done since we started to walk upright was not all in vain so we could continue to slaughter one another and continue to act like the barbarians we once were. Death is a necessity, we should not flaunt it."

Agree completely. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like to approach it from the angle that we're all animals and therefore all have the ability to become like them. I think it makes it easier to empathize if we accept that at the heart of us we are all still animals, with animal instincts. I know it's mostly semantics, but that's my (unsolicited) two cents. Also empathy doesn't equal sympathy, I can empathize with their situation, but i don't feel they deserve any mercy outside of a swift death. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So if you own a cat, and know that it isn't true, why did you assume i was being truthful? Cats are more aloof and solitary than dogs, the joke is then that they are less caring towards their owners and so they are likely to eat them faster. There is a running gag on the internet about cats being evil masterminds as well. The fact that it's not true is the joke.

<TEXT> High treason and petty treason originate from 14th century England. Petty treason was the murder of a superior by a subordinate. So a servant killing their master/mistress or a wife killing her husband. High treason was attempted (or planned) murder, murder, and levying war against the sovereignty. That included the king and his companions, and statesman (treasurer, justices). Most places don't have separate types of treason, as far as i know. England got rid of petty treason  a while ago. Canada has high treason and treason but the criteria for both historically falls under the former.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Provigil (modafinil) is an alertness agent so it will keep you awake but it doesn't really give you much in the way of energy. The upside is it doesn't work on the central nervous system so many of the classical side effects of standard stimulants aren't present. My fatigue isn't that bad any more and so I find it does what I need.  I personally don't notice much of a crash but you're mileage may vary. From what I've heard Nuvigil (armodafinil) has more of a cognitive effect than Provigil but I can't speak from experience.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Part of it, I think, Is what you said about education. My friends (and me) were all told that pot is just as impairing as alcohol. We all knew this to be untrue right away and add to that all the other lies we were told we ended up not taking it very seriously. We've grown up and realized how retarded of a justification it is but I can't help but wonder if we were told the truth about this stuff we might have given it the level of respect it deserves. Pot makes you sleepy, distracted, and slows reaction times. Saying that is far more effective than lying about it's effect.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Rambling often stumbles upon truth believe it or not.

I get the sense that you're a very poetic and introspective person. I really didn't think your concern with appearance was a shallow one given how you write and the feelings you were describing. 


So let's accept that there is an aspect of you going unfulfilled. That aspect as you say is stuck and it's trying to manifest itself through your appearance. The issue being you don't feel confident or secure enough to fully explore that expression. Let's also accept that it's a part of who you are and that conflict arises when it can't express properly.  

I deal with a lot of social anxiety myself, largely stemming from my relationship with my father. So I'm not going to simply tell you to get over it. However, it is causing you to be unhappy and even self-loathe so we must concede that it is in fact an issue that needs to be addressed.


So what do you know about this aspect? Is it yearning for any kind of expression? Or only physical appearance? What are it's motivations and what do you think would sate it's desires?

Also let me know if I've gone astray in my reasoning, I only know what you've told me here so it's very likely I've missed something.

<TEXT> How about string theory? That's one of the most mystical things I've ever heard, but i think they're looking for a different kind of mysticism. The kind that's not predicated on chalkboard wide equations, and can be justified simply by "feeling" that its true. 

I'm actually not sure why it seems to attract house spouses more. My layman theory would be that household work isn't rewarding in a broad sense because one cannot see improvements or a finished project since there really is no great end goal to accomplish. You repeat the same things pretty much day-to-day without ever reaching a satisfying conclusion. Construction workers are supposedly the most happy workers for this reason, that at the end of a project they can stand back, look at it, and say "i did that". House spouses don't really have that, despite working hard. I can understand how someone in that position might feel unaccomplished, or useless to those around them, because they can't necessarily point to anything tangible to validate themselves.  


This is where Oz and his secret knowledge come in. He promises change, he promises health, he promises the world, and all it takes is a few pills, maybe some oils, maybe a book. A small price to pay for something bigger than yourself right? They can be a part of a movement that the majority of people reject, which i think would make it appealing to someone looking for validation. Now there's something they can use to try to help their friends and family, or themselves, and since the benefits are largely intangible they can easily justify that it's working. Instead of just doing mundane but necessary things like laundry and dishes, now they are helping to save everyone from the evils of modern medicine and to show them the light of Oz. 

Also some are probably just not that bright, i'm not sure we can discount that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Might as well jump on the armchair psychology wagon. I think it has to do with how the information is perceived in those around them. Something like quantum physics, or nanotechnology, doesn't contain the mysticism (purposefully so) that these other "alternatives" do.


I also think some are trying to find their new religion. Their actions just remind me of a certain brand of religious person, the gnostic who has secret knowledge and is willing to share it with you to save your soul. You get the same sort of defensive reaction if you try to argue with them. Perhaps its just a certain personality that's attracted to so called "secret knowledge" and if you peddle it, they will come. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wouldnt women starting their own league just further cement the stigma that women just arent as good as men at video games? Women arent physically disadvantaged like in tennis, so a womens league just looks like they cant handle the pressure. And the thing is that there probably is more pressure on women in e-sports. However, lowering the bar isnt going to make them look any more competent. 

I guess it comes down to whether you just want more women competing or if you want women to be more respected. I think that if the women currently in e-sports can prove that they have it what it takes to compete on the same level it would go a lot more towards fostering a competive scene where women are commonplace. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, you'd still wear the band tshirts you have? And keep the posters up? you would't care at all about the publics perception of you as a person when you wear such clothing
 
Yes, yes, and why should i care what the public's perception is? I don't think what an artist does now erases the merit of the art in the past, or my appreciation of said art. I still have (and wear) a Megadeth t-shirt even though i disagree with Dave Mustaine in general, i still rep a Metallica wallet even though they're total douchecanoes now, i still enjoy my favorite As I Lay Dying tracks even though Tim Lambesis tried to hire a hitman on his wife. I like what i consider good art and im not afraid to express my like for it. This is why i prefaced my statement with "I don't know if i'm alone in this" because i legitimately wasn't sure how mainstream this opinion of art is.

Sure, but would you display his artwork proudly for everyone to see with his name on it going "Yep, that's my Hitler painting, isn't it just lovely?".

Absolutely.
 
That being said, I do agree that Hitler drew some nice landscape pictures, he wasn't amazing at all, but they were decent.

Ya they're nothing really special, i think they're decent though. 

Although this is less relevant as Hitler is dead (hopefully!), A better analogy would be if Hitler was alive and well today and still making art, would you buy his new art, funding him and his opinions?

I will concede here, i can't justify supporting something that hurts another person. This is my own fault for escalating it to Hitler levels. I would still support a band i disagree with politically, socially, or personally because i feel an artist should be compensated for good art. So long as they aren't hurting anyone but that wasn't the original point made, so good show. However, if somebody, let's say Charles Manson (because why not), were to put out a good thrash metal album. I'd still like that album, i just wouldn't support it financially. </TEXT>

If it was good art before they changed their political views I just don't see how it somehow stops being good art after the fact. In other words I think Hitler can be a good painter regardless of his stance on Jews, and to like a painting by Hitler is not agreeing with Hitlers message. At least in my opinion. </TEXT>

However, whos to say if Galbrush was written and portrayed in the same way Guybrush was (and from what i hear monkey island is considered good game) it wouldnt be recieved well by female gamers as a whole. Its an interesting discussion honestly. 

So what do you think contributes to the lack of female protagonists? Do you feel there is a lack?  Do you think there is a lack of well written characters in general as well? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I listened to the creators of South Park talk about how much difficulty they had with the MPAA with regards to their independent movie "Orgasmo". Apparently when you submit a cut of your movie the MPAA can rate it whatever they want but they cant tell you why they rated it that way (or what to cut to get a lower rating), "because then they would be a censorship organization" (the words Matt and Trey). So in Orgasmos case it got an NC-17, and the solution the MPAA gave Matt and Trey was to send in more cuts, but since this was before South Park, it wasnt monetarily feasible for them. They eventually got the rating they wanted but couldnt believe the stuff they could leave in and the stuff they needed to cut, apparently its super arbitrary. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They did add first-person, which by all accounts that ive heard, does make it more visceral and brutal. But i doubt they knew that so it seems oppurtunistic to me. They just went for the big fish even if it isnt any different (content wise) from last year. GTA is just too much of an easy and gigantic target (no pun intended) to not go after it, everyone already associates GTA with violence and stuff your grandma wont like so they barely have to argue to the moral panic crowd.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>   I understand where you're coming from but when i talk about forgiveness I don't mean everyone says sorry, and goes on happily, i really mean accepting the past as it is and trying as best as u can to move on. Forgiveness might not be best word for it, but i honestly don't know what else to call it. 

  I don't know your situation, and im not saying i do, but in my case my dad doesn't feel bad, doesn't show remorse and probably believes that me and my mom are the actual problem. We don't talk or have a relationship but i've done my best to forgive him, for my own sake, and regardless of what he feels to be reality. It's very hard to live for the now when you have one foot in the past waiting for things to change or waiting for an apology that may never come (thats my own personal experience, im not saying thats what you're doing)

Basically my point is, what's done is done, but you can choose how to go on from now, so whatever you choose best of luck man, and I hope you come to terms with this (whatever that means for you) </TEXT>

Yep, but it's called misanthropy, the hatred of humans in general. I'd say it's more apt than misogyny, because he did hate both, perhaps not equally, but he clearly disliked humanity and human sexuality overall. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm honestly not sure if prison will help or hinder him at this point. Essentially my thinking is that since he's basically a child, prison would just surround him with the type of people he's already (mistakenly) looking up to; other killers and criminals. Prison certainly isn't a walk in the park, but I have to wonder if putting him with these people would have the opposite effect of teaching him a lesson and would instead just cement him into the life of being a criminal. However, there's also the severity of the crime and the necessity of some form of punishment that has to be factored in. But if it's at the cost of creating another career criminal then whats the point?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh I'm well aware it was both an economic and cultural mainstay of the time, and had been for centuries prior. Racism was more of a justification than a motivator, they needed/wanted slaves and the Africans were easy targets or already enslaved and for sale. It was the dehumanization of the slaves that allowed people to sit idle while it happened. Hitler did much the same with Jews (although his motivations are different).

Of course not, well maybe some, but if they cared you would imagine they'd do something. I personally think they're just being elitist under the guise of being pro-equality. Think about it, they ask you to earn the privilege to even associate with them, they constantly demonize "the other", and they will completely break from reality before actually admitting their constant bitching does nothing. Being an SJW is being part of something exclusive and cutting edge and if they let anyone associate with them they wouldn't be precious little snowflakes anymore. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you find a good chiropractor it can be really amazing. The one I go to is strictly about clinical research and what has been proven to help, and honestly he has done wonders for my life. None of this crystal bullshit, he's explained the medicine behind what he does and it actually makes a ton of sense coming from someone invested in the scientific method. Of all the alternative medicines, chiropractic looks the most promising, and as a profession they're really pushing to separate from their pseudo-scientific beginnings. 

It's also worth noting i'm in Canada, chiropractors here are certified and can actually use the title of "doctor", since it takes ~10 years of medical school to become one here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In first world countries the discrimination generally comes from the zeitgeist, not the law. The law is against women in the middle east, they're basically second class citizens. Old cultural holdouts is what they are against in countries where they are equal under the law, just ignorant opinions and people. That mentality is dying out luckily, but culture changes slowly over time. These are attitudes people have held for centuries, it's going to take more than ~60 years of social progress to fully move on from it. </TEXT>

My mom isn't here right now to fill in the details, but the kid was pretty young and had somehow wandered behind the car as the dad was backing up. Died later in, or on the way to, the hospital. The dad was never really the same, despite it being an accident. I think he may have even ended up killing himself later on but i'm not sure. I hope the dad in this article can find a way to keep going, it's not going to be easy, but hopefully he'll find some sort of closure. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mob mentality helps as well, and this one had already gained momentum from previous lynchings. On an individual level it's much harder for them to justify these things but when you get hundreds of like-minded people together they just reaffirm for each other that what their doing is right. As a collective they can rationalize anything. Tie in that these people were raised thinking black people are sub-human, and the fact that law enforcement was either powerless or indifferent and you have a recipe for extreme sadism. 

Don't get me wrong though, this is absolutely disgusting and each and every person involved has their own special place in hell. The power of mob mentality and collective rationalization is simply terrifying though, and shouldn't be underestimated.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The whole "same amount of chemicals" argument is just a distortion of biology. All biological organisms are made of chemicals, hundreds to thousands generally. I'm actually fairly certain marijuana has *more* "chemicals" than tobacco. However, tobacco has rat poison, and formaldehyde, among other things, mixed into the leaves and paper for added flavor, burning smoothness, preservation etc. I'm not saying marijuana doesn't have carcinogenic properties and the tar can be just as bad (if you smoke a joint, it's different with a bong or especially a vape) but simply saying they have the same amounts of chemicals isn't really an indicator of anything but the amount of chemicals in them. </TEXT>

I think [this](http://www.theweedblog.com/the-difference-between-indica-and-sativa-marijuana-plants/) explains the differences between sativa and indica quite nicely. It also explains the medical benefits of both, its a good read. Anyway if you have any more questions feel free to pm me, ill answer what i can.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its no trouble at all, theres a lot more to it then first glance, and i know having someone experienced get me started helped a lot. About your bud, what does it smell like? Is it skunky? Or does it have a sweeter fruity kind of smell? Does it have no distinct smell at all? How strong would you say it smells? Is it dry to the touch? Does it grind up powdery or more in a clump? Do your fingers get a lot of chrystal like dust on them if you touch it? Or is it really sticky and dense? What color is it? Dark green, bright green, brown (hopefully not)? Can you see little red hairs on it? 

Sorry for all the questions but i can probably guess roughly what strain and quality it is from that info. I could be wrong but there are some things that heavily hint towards how good your weed is, and also these are questions you want to ask yourself when you buy pot. I can explain more with whatever answers you give me, if you want of course. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Again dont know much about vape brands and such but if you paid ~$100 or more its probably decent. You may want to adjust the temp manually if you can,  but im not quite sure what the ideal temp is (ive heard ~320f but im not % 100,  /r/trees probably knows aha). 

How many times have you smoked? Most people dont feel very much their first couple of times, some dont feel anything, so thats a factor. Quality of your weed also matters, you said it was ditch weed, which doesnt necessarily mean low thc/high cbd, it  could just have low of both. There are three major strains in the cannabis family, *cannabis indica* (lower thc, higher cbd, ie "body high"), *cannabis sativa* (higher thc, lower cbd, ie "head high"), and *cannabis ruderalis* which is hemp and has very low of both and really isnt sold. Now each strain is hard  to distinguish on sight and almost doesnt matter if it isnt properly grown dried and cured, but in general quality bud will be 1.) Smelly, it means its cured properly 2.) Not wet, it should be dry or dense and sticky but not damp and  3.) It will have lots kief or chrystal on it, its the powdery stuff  you get from grinding it. Theres more but thats the big 3 i can think of right now. If you are an MMJ patient i suggest asking for indica strains, if your not then selection isnt always an option unless youve got a good dealer.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You want to get it deep into your lungs, think about taking a big breath before jumping into a pool. You want to get as much air in as you can. Do the same with a vape except nice and slow, hold it for a couple seconds, then let out gently. It may take a little to get right. Also the quality of your vape matters, like a lot usually, a cheap one will not be effective, and if its handheld, it barely works in my experience. Vapes are more complicated then a bong or pipe, which use the basic principles of pressure to operate. Vapes need to be precise in their temperature, too hot and the pot burns and makes smoke, too little and the concentration wont be enough to work. If you want info on what kind to buy, im not much help, since im primarily a bong guy. If you make a thread on /r/trees explaining your situation im sure they would be more than happy to point you in the right direction. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I meant feminists as in, first world tumblr style feminists, that's the reason i specified them. They have nothing to fight for, because they refuse to acknowledge the things you've outlined. Personally I'm for egalitarianism, I don't deny that inequalities exist but it's no longer a fight for women to simply be recognized as equal legally, they won that (again in the 1st world), it's more nuanced now as you say. 

why are women still considered to be the "primary" caregivers?

[Tender Years Doctrine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tender_years_doctrine), feminists wanted to be considered primary caregivers. (It made sense at the time, Women had very little rights, and even though it has been abolished, it's the main reason women get preferential custody in the US)

I'm sorry that you seem to believe no one is actually out there fighting for people who aren't of their own gender

Where do you get that from? I never denied that people are fighting for equality, I just denied that tumblr feminists have anything to fight for, If they want to address the issues you outlined they would have to acknowledge the inequality men face. Which they won't. Please read my comment before replying, right after the quote you use at the top I specify I mean tumblr feminists, for the very reason that I know people out there are actually fighting for things. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree that overall men have it better, but that's why I specified *1st world tumblr-style* feminists and not feminists as a whole. I'm not stupid enough to try to claim women are equal everywhere, that's just plain not true, as Saudi Arabia and the like kindly demonstrate on a regular basis. There are definitely still things that need to be changed in this world. I also agree that passive aggressive taunts at feminism does jack shit, but does that mean that men should be met with violence every time they want to talk about things? I personally think feminism and MRA's are misguided, I side with egalitarianism and humanism. However, i don't think either of these groups should be prevented from discussing what they want simply because I either disagree or because it gets nothing done. Just because MRA's are mostly talk does not mean they should be met with hostility, although it's a completely valid criticism of the movement. 

Frankly, I agree with everything you just said, neither tumblr feminism nor MRA's are changing anything. And those are absolutely valid critiques of both movements. However, neither deserves to be outright prevented from discussing their opinions and thoughts simply because it doesn't change the world. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In a lot places 16 year olds can consent (Canada, Scandinavia, etc) and even if they can't most places have legislature that outlines the acceptable difference in age. I.E I think here (Canada) it's 3 years(?) so that if a couple are 15 and 17, and one of them turns 18, or if a 14 and a 15 year old do it, it's not automatically statutory rape. There is a lower cut off point though i think, where they cannot consent no matter what. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why are people so afraid of having men talk about their own issues? Personally, I think it points to a bigger problem; feminists have nothing to fight for. Or at least 1st world tumblr-style feminists don't. They can vote, they can drive, they can fuck who they want, go where they please, they have tons of scholarships dedicated solely to women (while all others are unisex i believe), and businesses are actively encouraged to hire women. All the fighting has already been done by the much stronger and more equality driven feminists of old. 


So what do modern feminists have left? Nothing really, they've won for the most part, and they're now trying to push for female supremacy. Evidence of which is their outright hostility towards men even thinking to address their half of the populations problems. How do you make sure your ideology goes unchallenged? Silence any and all dissent, something that would be (rightfully) denounced as oppression in a heartbeat if it were to happen to them. To me it seems like they really want to be the oppressors, while at the same time being the victims. Which are obviously two very contradictory positions. (sorry that got a little long.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's assumed, however, I will give her the benefit of the doubt on that, since I can't confirm whether she was actually drunk or not. The police will likely make a statement about it in the following weeks. All news sources are basically unanimous on the fact that she was driving on the wrong side of the road before she struck and killed 2 other people though. If some drug wasn't involved i'd be surprised, although stranger things have happened. </TEXT>

You know the ones she hit while driving the *wrong way* down a freeway, they're trying to say they had a hand in being hit by her and dying. As if they were somehow responsible for hitting the car flying at them from the wrong fucking direction. The nerve of these people is astounding, I hope she's never allowed to drive a car again, sopmeone this dumb should be chipped and monitored. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So based on your article the solution would be to standardize an amount for each portion size, not ban 16 ounce drinks outright. The problem it outlined is that different establishments have different definitions of "large" and "regular" and people react differently to different labels. So having 16 ounces as regular means people drink more than if it was labelled "extra large". The actual amount didn't really matter it's just how it was presented that changed peoples behavior towards it. 

I think one should have the choice to get a 16 ounce drink if they want to but restaurants have to label them large or extra large and not have them as the regular size. I'm not one of those people who would get a 16 oz, I drink very little soda but it just seems kind of ridiculous to try to prevent adults from having certain amounts of a soft drink. Especially when they can go buy enough booze and cigarettes to kill themselves if they so desire. Just seems excessive and misguided to me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Things outside of the realm of science generally fall into this, not to say science is infallible, just that science acknowledges it's fallibility and actively works to correct it. Scientific facts aren't ones that can be argued from emotion, or really from lenses other than the scientific method. SJW's hate this because they've been taught how to think through the lens of feminist and post-modernist critique. These lenses have their uses but they can't be applied to scientific fact because science doesn't give a damn whether it considers women or not. The natural world is unfair, it's harsh, things are rarely equal, and it's not because white men say it is but because humans have observed these phenomena and written them down. Trying to argue that fat has no negative health consequences because it makes you *feel bad* is ridiculous, it's like trying to argue the speed of light is privileged because it is faster than other waveforms and therefore oppressing them (yes someone argued this). All these people need is evidence and a good argument to disprove these basic biological concepts but they won't find any because they'd rather complain about how it makes them sad. </TEXT>

Please don't try to twist my words.


Honestly I don't listen to a7x, besides the occasional song, you don't need to try to convince me about heavy metal. I completely agree that metalcore in general is horrible and watered down garbage but that's all opinion, music is all opinion, and your opinion is no more valid than mine.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hell if I knew them I would get them the best strain I could find. Sourcing may be the problem though actually, finding someone who is very likely outside their social circle to sell them illegal substances in a trustworthy manner is not a small task. It's very possible that they don't have stoners in their social circles, and finding someone who can provide a product that not only is the right strain but safe and reliable is not exactly simple. Ya there's lots of dealers out there but a lot of them aren't upstanding citizens, and would just as happily rip you off, or maybe rob you if their really nuts. So I can understand being very hesitant with not only buying but giving unregulated things you got off the street to your children. Again, we understand pot is never really messed with (it's not cost effective to lace it with more expensive drugs) plus a lot of dealers are genuinely great people but they don't know that, and if they don't have someone to show them the ropes, they're going to be extremely cautious.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well in WW1 Britain declared war for us in 1914 (we didn't have control over foreign affairs at the time), then America joined in 1917. In WW2 Canada declared war on Germany a few days after Britain in 1939, America joined in 1942. We we're both in the Korean war so there's that. We weren't in Vietnam, or Iraq 1, but we were part of the coalition for Iraq 2. Canada tends to do peacekeeping missions instead of invasions or wars (we have a standing army of like 60,000, what do you expect?) So in reality we haven't really gone to war in tandem, like ever, it would be more accurate to say Canada has rode shotgun with Britain in every single war. That being said, you Americans do your own thing, always have, and we'll gladly share a beer with ya whenever buddy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In a way he's right, a spanking without follow up can end up teaching the child nothing, especially if the spanking doesn't happen right after whatever incident incited it. If you just randomly pull the kid aside and spank them, there's little guarantee they will figure out what they did wrong (depending on the age and the intelligence of the child). That being said reserving a decent spanking for the serious stuff and a good talk afterwards about why it happened and what they did wrong is pretty effective, at least in my experience. </TEXT>

It can be hard to separate the illness from the person though, because in a way mental illness is part of who we are. It doesn't necessarily define us but it does have an effect on how we act, the choices we make, and the thoughts we think (in highly varying ways from person to person). It's a tough character trait to pull off correctly without some experience in it and it can be easy for someone unfamiliar to paint it in strokes of black and white. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a person who lives with mental illness i think it's a good thing to expose people to mental illness, good or bad. I feel it humanizes it, and brings the reality of both the good and evil parts of it into the light instead of ignoring that aspect of humanity entirely. When we push things into the realm of no discussion, we dehumanize it, we put it outside our reality, which makes it hard to understand. 

Not that every show/movie/book/game needs a mentally ill character or even that all mentally ill characters are necessary. However, I take no offense to an evil character who suffers from depression, it makes the villain human to me, and not just a character who's sole purpose is being evil. I just think characters without flaws are boring, and don't really represent how humans actually think or act. </TEXT>

They've never explained how thin people in anyway fit this description. They just say that we're oppressing them and provide this definition as if it proves some innate fact. Seriously though, has anyone even attempted to explain how thin people are not only one homogenous group of unified belief but also how they have access to social power by virtue of having less mass. I mean it, I want to know, in detail, how exactly are they being systematically oppressed and how exactly do they know it's by thin people specifically. Things like paying more for more material, paying more for taking up more space, being called fat, not being happy about yourself, and not having special accommodations made for you are not systemic oppression but consequences of your weight.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>    When i was younger I was really unashamed, and not self conscious at all. I would say anything, do anything, and wasn't really scared of what people thought of me. Unfortunately, I contracted Chronic Fatigue Syndrome at around 11 years old. This caused me to miss lots of school and I managed to gain a lot of weight as well. Due to me not being there I missed lots of what I think were key social milestones. Now about 6 years later I'm pretty socially withdrawn, i've developed some rather annoying anxieties, and my self-confidence is shot to hell. I managed to lose all the weight I had amassed and i'm even pretty jacked at this point but I still can't seem to get a grasp on my head. I'm in largely the same boat as you, I hate the way my brain makes assumptions, I hate not being able to confidently look at girls even though I know I'm not unattractive, I hate not being able to make sense of any of this. I'm seeking therapeutic help, and am slowly learning how to accept my flaws and be happy with the cards i've been dealt. It's hard though, and I think most people will tell you the same, changing things that seem almost hard coded into your personality is not a task to be undertaken lightly. 


  So I guess my point is that what you're experiencing is not wholly unique to you. There are others who have felt and overcame what we both go through, probably not in the exact same contexts, but overcome nonetheless. It's just always easier said than done. However, you deserve a better life, one unburdened by anxieties, and that life is in your hands to create. It will require action on your part, you are going to have to overthrow this and if you don't know how, therapy is probably your best bet. Just remember you are always worth it, you and your life are worth all the effort in the world. It may not seem like it at times but you as a person is the most valuable thing you will ever have.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> At 18 it's not likely he's going to grow out of anything, his habits are just going to become more and more concrete. Unless he has some epiphany, or you somehow manage to get through to him, he's just going to continue to be the adult he turned in to. I don't blame your mom for thinking of him as her baby (all moms are varying levels of crazy), but he's an adult, what he does is of his own volition and is his responsibility.

Edit: Ok, i didnt think this through before posting. People can change, it was stupid of me to assume he wouldnt.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I honestly think it started as justification for keeping the slaves. I'm not a historian by any means so my opinion should be taken for next to worthless on this subject but I don't think racism was the huge driving force behind slavery. Slavery was a fact of the time, has been for longer than naught, it was just an easy source of free labor. It's also inhumane and horrible, so there wasn't much way to justify it morally to the populace. Unless the people you were enslaving are less than human, or not worthy of humane treatment. It's much easier to justify enslaving a dehumanized entity then one who thinks and feels the same way we do. It's what Hitler did to the Jews, made them out to be sub-human, something dangerous and worthy of destruction. It was easier to convince white Europeans and Americans that Black people were subhuman because they were physiologically different, came from a more primitive country, and couldn't communicate with the populace (at first, they learned eventually). Over hundreds of years, this justification turned into a more innate social racism as children were taught that black people deserved to be treated in such a way. People grew up knowing no different, they were taught racism and so racism festered. Until people who were not taught such things saw how disgusting it was and decided it needed to be ended. Again, I'm not historian and this opinion may be woefully wrong in regards to the real historical context so make what you will of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well this dates back to the Greeks, who were possibly the most comfortable society has ever been with nudity. They took pride in the male form (sometimes to crazy extents) and saw no need to exaggerate the size of genitalia. They also, as a culture, celebrated youthfulness, nature, and the use of brain as the ultimate sign of masculinity. So if a Greek sculpture or artist created a man with a ridiculous schlong, not only would everyone call bullshit (because everyone was naked at least part of the time) they wouldn't have found it attractive or appealing since that isn't what their society deemed desirable. It would have been seen as a barbaric simpleton and not a learned Greek warrior. 

Renaissance era artists like Michelangelo were referencing the Greek artistic style when creating things like the Statue of David, or the Sistine Chapel (small dongs on that too). Today's culture is actually extremely prudish in comparison to the Greeks. We shame nature, nudity, and sex. So is it really any surprise that when what comes naturally is shamed, we come up with unnatural and unrealistic expectations of it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's odd because I have feeling people like this would be quick to call us racist if we had to point out the color of accomplished people as proof of some innate racial superiority. Bringing race up at every chance only further serves to make it an issue, which is probably what some people want (so they can continue to use the race card). Seriously, it will stop being such a big problem when people stop injecting it into every goddamn conversation and issue. Sometimes arbitrary melanin count just isn't part of the issue and it's really ironic because these people (SJW's and such) are supposedly against racism when they themselves seem to think that race is a big deal when it comes to dealing with people. </TEXT>

Not that it isn't deserved in some cases, it's just that I always advocate for the use of proper legal channels since the likelihood of the internet misfiring and jumping on innocents is pretty high (I guess i just don't support vigilantism in general). This though, this seems like a community letting these fuckers know that their bullshit has consequences. And I'm pretty conflicted as to whether that's better than vigilantism or not. </TEXT>

Where did you get that from? I said that if cops can anally probe a guy over nothing, then them searching phone contents isn't all that unlikely.

<TEXT> I rolled over on to my right side, seeking optimal comfort under the oppressive softness and warmth of my heavy comforter. Letting out a sigh of content I curled up tighter, trying to squeeze every bit of warmth from this unforgiving room. Winter nights have always been the worst in this house. The draft that permeated the upper floors was almost unbearable at times, prompting the purchase of the extra thick bedsheets. One would think that there must be some sort of problem with the top floor, perhaps a lack of insulation, or improperly laid venting. The problem here is that I've had the house inspected several times by various different people. From furnace and duct work specialists to general contractors and so far no one has found anything of note. It was frustrating to say the least but luckily everything else about the house is great. I should probably just invest in a space heater and stop complaining to be honest. 


As the thoughts of of my house slowly wound down into peaceful nothingness, the hands of the sandman carefully wrapped around me, dragging me ever more quickly into his realm of slumber. Biology seemed to have a different idea though, and with my consciousness waning my bladder made a desperate plea. "Seriously?" I thought to myself "Always at the worst times, I swear". I grumbled audibly as I tentatively removed myself from my wonderful cocoon and stepped into the frigid landscape that was my bedroom. I grabbed a sweater that hung from the door and slipped it on, already shivering in the pale moonlight. Glancing at my alarm told me it was 12:26 am. I had been tossing and turning for nearly 2 hours. I've suffered from mild insomnia for years, so this wasn't anything new to me. However it didn't make it any more easy to leave my thermal sanctuary. 


As if sensing what I was doing my bladder let out an even more desperate cry, forcing me to nearly duck waddle as I made my way down the dark hallway to the bathroom. I flicked the light switch on, blinding myself in the process. Through squinted eyes I was able to make out the toilet and begin my business. My eyes had adjusted by the time I was finished, so I took a moment to inspect my face in the mirror as I washed my hands. My eye's were those of a man who was far too tired and cold, nearly dead in their stare. If I they weren't mine I'd probably be scared of eyes like this. I took a second to inspect the thin scar that ran across the bridge of my nose, a remnant of my childhood. I had apparently done battle with a coffee table when I was 5 and the coffee table won. "I got a cool scar out of it at least" I thought to myself.


I finished my hands and flushed the toilet. This is my least favorite part of late night wanderings. I stood in the doorway, took a deep breath and turned off the bathroom light. Now I'm not a superstitious person, I'm not paranoid, I'm not one to jump at shadows. For some reason though, standing in total darkness waiting for my eyes to adjust, has always terrified me, even in my own home. When i was younger It was a real problem. I'd never go to the bathroom at night unless i absolutely had to, to the point where wetting the bed was a more preferred outcome. As I became older it did get better but even now at 23 i still get freaked out about late night lavatory visits. They say that the fear of the dark is simply the fear of the unknown and i believe that holds true. I'd imagine it's a primeval thing, dating back to when a shadow in the dark was likely a predator trying to eat you. The lack of predators in the urban sprawl doesn't comfort me though. When my eyes finally came into focus I started to make my retreat towards my downy fortress.


My eyes deceived me though and i managed to stub my pinky toe, on the unseen door to the laundry room, which had been left slightly open. The pain was bad but i was too tired to do anything but grumble and shuffle back to my room. Slipping the sweater off, I crawled back into bed. I was beginning to drift off again when i heard it. A single muffled bump. Normally this wouldn't have really bothered me but I was already on edge from my recent expedition. I decided It was probably nothing until I heard another one a minute or so later. It was strange but likely just an animal on the roof. But it continued and my sleep deprived mind went to thoughts of Jeremy. This is what got me out of bed. Slowly standing up, I donned my sweater once more and stepped into the dim hallway for a second time. 


I made my way slowly down the hall, my eyes already keen in the darkness. I didn't want to turn on any lights lest I lose what night vision I had. I made it to the bathroom and listened. I heard the bump again, it definitely wasn't on the roof like I had previously thought. It seemed to be coming from downstairs. My stomach jumped into my chest. I lost all sense of self preservation and ran downstairs not caring who was listening. I made it to the second door on the left and swung it open, flicking on the light as i did so. 


What greeted me was extremely relieving. "What are you doing Jeremy? Whats the matter?" I asked. My son looked at me, a rather terrified and confused look on his face and then he ran over and hugged my leg. I picked him up, and held him tightly as he tried his best to explain what was wrong. He was a decent speaker for 3 but he seemed to be trying to say a couple different things at once. I calmed him down and eventually found out that he had heard a monster making noise upstairs. He said he didn't want to go up there so he tried banging on his wall to get attention. I smiled at that, which prompted and even more quizzical look from my son. "Don't worry I was just up there, and If there were any monsters they must have run away scared". Jeremy seemed relieved at that, but still seemed a bit shaken up. "Do you want to sleep in our bed tonight?" I asked , i got a small nod in answer. I carried him upstairs, showing him the lack of monsters firsthand, which calmed him down immensely. By the time i laid him in between my wife and I, he was already sound asleep. My wife rolled over a gave me a look, to which i responded "Don't worry about it, just dealing with some monsters". I climbed into bed pecked my wife and son on the cheek and drifted off.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly I'm surprised China even had a somewhat valid argument for the women, heels really are not good driving shoes. I actually would have expected a more Saudi Arabian approach, in that they would just say women are inferior drivers for being women and that they can't drive cars because it hurts their uterus (although sitting in the passenger seat doesn't effect it for some reason?). Have to give credit to China for at least trying to have an actual reason and in a country where female babies are still considered inherently inferior, it counts for something i think.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I watched as the streetlight flickered above me, a dancing flame in the cool night. I observed, as it illuminated the darkness for a brief second and then stole it away, only to bath the recesses in light another time. My mind tried to grasp at a pattern in the intermittent flashing of the dying bulb, but there was none to be seen. I continued to search for repetition or some way to predict what would come next. It was fruitless though, some things follow no pattern. Yet, I find myself searching for these illusive sequences in everything i do. Most of the time I don't even realize it's happening. Until someone asks why I've been staring at a dripping faucet for 5 minutes. If I had to guess I'd say it's a fear of the unknown if anything. I just feel comfortable in routine, in predictability, leaving things to chance has never sat well with me. 


"Yo Danny, what's good my man?" A voice from behind me said, breaking me from my trance. I felt a hand pat my shoulder a few times. 


"It's all good Spence, how you been?" I said standing up and turning around to greet the reason I was sitting on the curb at nearly half past 10 on a Wednesday.


"I'm doin good bro, making flow. Been pretty quiet around here lately"


I looked around at the deserted houses, detritus strewn along their yards and spilling on to the street. The colors were faded, the windows broken, graffiti was on nearly every available spot. It was sad more than anything. Those houses once held families, they were once places of comfort to many people. Now they're either deserted or used as drug dens. Watching this street die was painful but thinking about the lives involved is even worse to me.


"Ya it's a real ghost town around here" I said focusing back onto Spencer. "We should probably hurry this up before we get some unwanted attention" 


"Relax man, no ones gonna bug us" Spencer said looking from one end of the street to the other. "You want your regular I'm guessing?"


"You know it" 


I pulled some cash out of my wallet, the last I had to be honest, and handed it over. What I got in return was a small plastic dime-bag. 


"Thanks dude, take er easy. I'll probably hit you up tomorrow" I said fist bumping Spence and taking my leave. 


I could hardly contain myself as i left the deal, I nearly ran back to my apartment. Clutching my prize the entire time, as if it would fly away if I weren't careful. I went up the 2 flights of stairs to my room and quickly went in and locked the door behind me. There was trash littering the floor, old pizza boxes, bills, and candy wrappers for the most part. It didn't bother me though, I just walked around it or kicked it out of the way as I went to my bedroom. The bedroom was no better than the rest of the apartment. The bed smelled and was unmade, the sheets were stained and grimy. Again didn't bother me, although i should wash the sheets soon. I sat on the edge of my bed and pulled out something from under it. It was an old cigar box, dark red and about the size of a football. It had my father's initials engraved on the top as well as some fancy design or something. It was one of the few things of his that I kept after he died. It had once housed a couple of Cuban cigars that my dad would puff on every once in a while. Usually for a celebration of some sort. Now it held a tourniquet, spoon, lighter and a few fresh hypodermic needles. 


My hands made deaf work of the spoils, quickly heating it and getting it prepped. Though, even with practiced hands I couldn't go quick enough to stop the shakes, and by the time I had found a vein they had started to become quite violent. I finally managed to get it in after a few failed attempts, injecting it gently into my bloodstream as the shakes continued to worsen. I removed the needle and laid back in my bed, the opiate quickly speeding through my body. I closed my eyes and let it happen, basking in the drug induced glow and contemplating my situation. 


This is one pattern i can reasonably predict. My penchant for substance abuse. I'm aware of what it's doing to me, it's effect on my health both mental and physical. The drain on my finances, my relationships and yet I find it hard to care. Because in this moment as my high begins, as the shakes wear down, as the struggles of the day to day shrug off me like many heavy chains; I am home.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm all for the CC doing good things and adapting and all that but i don't think we should start giving out tons of brownie points to the pope or the church for being decent human beings. Don't get me wrong I don't unconditionally hate the CC (i do admittedly dislike it though) it's just helping the poor and being humble are things they've been preaching for centuries. I don't feel the pope should be praised for doing things they have been telling others to do for close to 2000 years. Again progress is good, i'm happy that they're at least trying to move forward but they still have lots of ground to cover in my eyes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well that's different you see. Men don't have sex because they enjoy the company of women they do it because they hate women and want to rape them. So heterosexual males are all misogynistic and because of that any sex they have is really just violent rape. This is different to a glorious woman hating the people who imprison her, that's her right and being attracted to men means they are just oppressing her super hard. Therefore the only real misandrist's are the women who have realized they are being horribly oppressed and have opened up their true free lesbian as it is meant to be.

<TEXT> You're a little off, It's entirely debatable and actually would be pretty easy to disprove. It's part of the beauty of science, any and all theories can be challenged or argued and it's necessary that they are. When we start claiming there's no arguing with the current explanation we create dogma. The only thing evolution deniers need is evidence, a fossil in the wrong spot from the wrong time period or a transitional species that doesn't fit the current model, anything besides belief to prove their position. If they find one of those, write a peer reviewed study on it and can argue it effectively then we'd have no reason but to consider their position. The fact that they've found none of those in the hundred years or so the theory has been around is pretty telling however. We just need to keep in mind that it's possible for science to be wrong, and not shirk away from admitting it when it happens, something that religion might never do, and part of why science consistently gets results. </TEXT>

If the debtor isn't paying or the creditor wants a more structured payment plan (enforceable under the law) he/she can file for an examination hearing which examines the debtors finances and ability to pay. After examination the judge can then order the debtor to pay on certain dates if he see's fit. If the debtor does not pay, then there are 2 options left, garnishment of wages and seizure of land and property. Both require further paperwork and fee's, plus the seizure process is quite long and complicated. Basically if it's a relatively small amount and you have a really stubborn debtor it can very well end up costing more than the settlement itself.  </TEXT>

But repeating the same mistake (or even less likely, different mistakes that cause the same outcome) consistently is just not likely in the slightest. 

  It'd be like a sports team that get's a penalty or something. The first one can be blamed on the ref, or an accident, or anything. The second and third could still be accidents, or the ref just doesn't like them. However, if this team is getting 2-3 penalties (assuming that's not ordinary for that sport) every game regardless of the refs, the blame almost certainly falls on the team itself, or more specifically it's management.  </TEXT>

Again very happy that you got out and that you've found some stability.

<TEXT> Reminds me of a debate i saw with Hitchens, Dawkings, and Grayling (IIRC) on the topic of "Is religion bad for society". Dawkings (or Grayling) spoke first for the atheist and brought up historical and current examples of theocratic evil, listing only places that start with the letter "b". His argument basically pointed out that religion has had hundreds of chances to be good for society and has failed (rather horribly in some cases) almost every time. 

The speaker directly after him was a Rabbi who's entire argument was "My synagogue does charity work, and we're all really good people, and there's no bad that comes from religion because my congregation does good things so that's proof that religion only does good things." Pure feelsy anecdotes to counter Dawkins exposition about the very real things religion has done when it has power. She essentially undermined the entire position with her little sermon about feels and ignoring larger contexts in favor of happy anecdotes.  </TEXT>

I dont have the book on me atm but to summarize it said much the same thing: complex carbs, low fat but also all good fat from things like yogurt and nuts, plenty of protein from lean meats (and nuts again), high fiber, tons of vegetables (leafy greens especially), fruit but not a lot. 

The book really stood out to me because its incredibly sensible in its principles and 
extremely comprehensive. Its really worth a read now that im thinking about it. The approach it gave me to eating and exercise is really great. When i get it back ill read over it and refresh my memory see if anything else might help people. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Diet and CFS </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-10-18 17:50:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So /u/Kromulent thinks my choice of diet is deserving of a post here. Now i can't take credit for this diet plan, as it's tenants were outlined to me in a book called *The New Abs Diet* by David Zinczenko (editor-in-chief of men's health). The book has nothing relating to CFS in it but the diet it set forth produced interesting results for me. 


Basically eating healthy is obvious for most of us. Good food = more nutrients and essentials = good functioning body. What surprised me was that the strictness of times for eating had the most impact. The way the diet is setup is as follows.


You eat 6 times a day, 3 meals (400-500 cal), and 3 snacks (200-300 cal) at specific times. An example of what this might look like (starting time should be just after you wake up) is: 8 am meal, 11 am snack, 1 pm meal, 4 pm snack, 6 pm meal, 9pm snack. The goal is too have 3 hours between a meal and a snack and 2 hours between a snack and a meal. 


It seems pretty anal, and it really is but I noticed that my body adapted really quickly and I'm at a point where I'm almost only hungry at the times I'm used to eating at. The interesting thing though, is that my energy is more stable and constant than before, i crash less frequently and not as severely. I find keeping a level amount of food in the body prevents energy spikes and subsequent troughs, or at least lessens their impact. The routine part of it also allows for the better planning of meals and i find it's a good framework for other pre-planned daily tasks, it just feels less stressful when you know when to do certain things.


I'm not sure how this will effect other people but i've had success with it and it's not a pill or anything drastic. Which means anyone can give it a shot and i'd say it's worth a try at the least. I wish the best of luck to everyone, i hope this helps in some way. </TEXT>

I just see these as common factors (at least one) in all FPS's. 

1.) Confirmation Bias

This is a big one and very common in TiTP and other people who believe in "fat oppression". Confirmation bias is when one harbors a preconceived notion and in turn looks for confirmation of it in everything they do. A great example is fatties who get offended when a skinny person looks better in a dress. With the bias the fatty doesn't see a skinny person with a nice dress because they feel like wearing it, or want to look good. No they see a skinny person *trying to show them up*. In their mind they've already come to the conclusion that you are oppressing them and thus will grasp at any straw no matter how thin and then take it the most offensive way possible. They then hold up their delusion as fact of their oppression.

2.) Self Victimization

It's hard to tell what is a bias and what is "Playing the victim". Porkers always seem ready to spin a tale so that they are the ones being hurt. I think that playing the victim is simply a means to an end though. I believe that it's necessary for them to maintain their bias, their delusion. If they were in the wrong, then they aren't being oppressed. They've already confirmed in their minds that they are oppressed and therefore the story in their head takes shape as them in the right. Every. Time. Now it could also be the inability to accept personal responsibility and in which case they aren't playing the victim, they legitimately think they *are* the victim. It could also simply be a condition of their psyche, some people get off to being a victim. I think in most cases though it's a reaffirmation of an already made up mind.


3.) Protagonist delusion (delusions of grandeur/entitlement)

There's probably a word for this but I'm going to call it "Protagonist Delusion". It's a personal delusion in which ones self is considered to be the main character of the story that is life. That one is more important than another because in their mind the story was written for them. This is a universally human delusion that i feel effects everyone to a certain degree. My theory is it's because you can only experience your own life. You have no possible way of feeling through the eyes of another person. You have no reference point but yourself, and other people aren't you. Critical thinking and empathy would dictate that another life is just as valuable (or invaluable depending on your thoughts of the species) as your own. Those lacking these skills though, may dismiss everyone else as "background characters" thus leading to a sense of entitlement. A good example is Hammies thinking that everyone should be attracted to them, or that they should get special treatment, or just that general air about them, that they think they are better than you. It may stem from a need for attention, it may also stem from a disconnect from reality. I don't know the cause but the effect is there.

4.) Self esteem and confidence

Or the reason HAES is so popular. Gas giants would like you to think they are unaffected by society or biology and it's bias towards health. For some they probably aren't, but most i feel at some level know they are being disgusting. I think this leads to a lot of the lashing out that planets seem to do. They are hurting a lot but instead of trying to get over it they blame others and internalize it. It also causes them to seek out constant self-reassurance in their delusions. If that takes the form a 50 year-old outdated and dis-proven study than so be it, it supports their reality. 

5.) Rejection from society (real or imagined) 

I have no doubts that bullying of fat people exists. It's just that the root factor is more than likely not their weight. See bullies don't care who or what you are if you have any kind of weakness, anything about you that might be embarrassing. They will find it and they will exploit it. They make fun of weight not because they hate fat people (most of the time, im sure there are some people who just hate fatties) but because it hurts you. If they couldn't draw a reaction from it they'd stop it and move on to something that will. Now it could also be that the person is just an asshole and people are mean to them because they are just genuinely unlikeable. Regardless, a person who's bullied (or feels they are) is in a very vulnerable state of mind. It would be fairly easy for them or someone else to convince them it's not *them* but their *weight*.  It's comforting to think it's just some stupid superficial thing and not that they don't like you or that somethings wrong with you.  I think this thinking leads to a confirmation bias, and ultimately to fat logic.

Let me know what you guys think. Do you think im close with some? Or is the beetus actin up again and makin me write nonsense? </TEXT>

<TEXT> First, pics:

[Before](http://imgur.com/xPAjqDj) 6' (183 cm), 230lbs (104kg), mostly fat (not the best pic but the best one i had right before i started losing weight)

[After](http://imgur.com/VIFgWII) 6', 172lbs (78kg), mostly muscle

I suffer from a condition called [Chronic Fatigue Syndrome](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/chronicfatiguesyndrome.html) so for a while i considered exercise too strenuous. It took too much of a toll on my body. The outcome of such a mentality (coupled with my eating habits) is no surprise; I became fairly overweight. I ballooned up to my highest of ~230lbs right around the age of 14-15, I.E the beginning of high school. So i spent most of my first year trying to hide my body, generally feeling uncomfortable in any clothes i wear and scared of social situations. That summer though everything just kind of clicked. I decided i was going to do something about it. 

I got my mom to help teach me about nutrition and I started scouring the web for information and a workout routine. I started with some generic bodyweight/light dumbbell circuit training and i began restricting calories and food. As you can imagine it was a bitch at first, as is common. However, as the months went by my body became more and more adapt to exercise. I still ached and felt like crap a lot but i was seeing results and goddamnit i wasn't giving up now. Around the 5-6 month mark i had hit my initial goal of 195lbs. I could have stopped there, goal accomplished, and it would have still been a success. I found a love in fitness though, I wanted to see just how far i could make it. Another 3 or 4 months later i was at 170 lbs, almost under weight, something i never thought would happen.

Since that time more than a year ago, i've been adding muscle+definition, and working on my cardio (which i admittedly  neglected for most of my weight loss). I've changed routines lots of times but i've returned to a circuit training routine for the last couple months to get rid of any and all excess fat. 

More important than my weight loss though is the skills i've learned while doing it, things i never knew that i had in me. Discipline, self-control, self-motivation, self-determination, structure, routine, organization and more. These are things that are desperately needed to survive with a chronic illness and i'm thankful everyday that i decided to change myself. I really feel that fitness has saved my life or at least certainly enhanced my ability to enjoy it. 

For those wondering my weekly routine as of now goes like this

Monday: Full body circuit training with an ab circuit to begin

Ab circuit: Upper abs (Crunches), Lower Abs (Pulse Ups), Obliques (Side crunches), Transverse abdominis (Plank), Lower Back (Seated Good Mornings) 

Full body circuit: Squat, Bench Press, Pulldown, Military Press, Bent Over Row, Tricep Pulldowns, Leg Extensions, Bicep Curls, Leg Curls. 

Tuesday: 3km interval style run

Wednesday: Ab circuit with different exercises to hit the same body parts. Then same full body workout as Monday. 

Thursday: 3km interval style run

Friday: Leg day, no ab circuit but a slightly different full body circuit.

Leg day circuit: Deadlifts, Bench Press, Pulldown, Weighted Lunges, Military Press, Bent Over Row, Weighted step-ups, Tricep Pulldowns, Leg Extensions, Bicep Curls, Leg Curls. And i sometimes go for a run after.

Saturday: Ab circuit

Sunday: Off

I'll answer any questions to the best of my ability. If this isn't the place to put this let me know and thanks for reading!

<TITLE> F2F - How I prevented the genesis of a Hamplanet </TITLE>

<TEXT> EDIT:Very sorry for being an idiot and not reading the posting guide. All further posts will fall in line with those rules, again my apologies.
TL;DR I lost lot's of weight after i got fed up with myself.
Greetings my fellow whale watchers. I'm new to this site and FPS is by far my favorite subreddit since i started reading a couple days ago. I have seen several stories of people who were motivated from this site. I'm not one of them, but perhaps I can serve as an inspiration. For you see i've been on the magical journey towards fitness and have been quite successful (IMO). So perhaps my story might resonate with some of you lusciously curvy individuals out there. 

So to begin some back story is needed. I grew up in a mid-sized Canadian town. In school i was an average kid, weight and height wise, until about Grade 3 (9 or 10 years old) when i started showing symptoms of what would later by diagnosed as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome). To complicate things I had a major growth spurt the year after, i shot up to 5''8' or so which took a toll on me. My eating and exercise habits up to this point had peen poor at best. Lot's of quick meals, lot's of snacks, no real control on portions and the CFS made exercise harder since i never felt like i had the energy to do it. Add that all together and I was a Hamplanet in the making. 

Fast forward to Grade 9. I was just under 6'', 230lbs+ and gaining. I had started playing football the year before to try and combat it (I was pretty good, surprisingly, but it always took a lot out of me). I played in high school and noticed moderate improvement on my cardio and lung capacity but I was still gaining weight. During that season i suffered further injury to an already bad shoulder to the point where i had to quit because i could cause lifelong injuries. So here i am, overweight, self-conscious, and now without my only source of exercise. The hammy cosmos were rejoicing that day, having made preparations to admit me into the Interstellar Hamplanet society. 

Now here's the part where most people get lost. That summer, coupled with the new social hierarchy posed by HS, my self esteem was at an all time low. I wasn't the fattest but i had really unsightly rolls, man tits, stretchmarks, and like most overweight people i never felt comfortable in or out of clothes. One day (couldn't tell you which) i decided to change myself. This is where people have a hard time. "But subject1493 what do you mean nothing inspired you to lose weight?", "It can't be that simple subject1493" Oh but is. It just clicked one day, I'm doing this to myself. I had blamed my circumstance in the past. My genetics, my condition, but i realized that I wasn't exactly doing anything to help myself. I had been sitting on my butt upset with myself for years because nothing was changing, but what the hell was i doing to change it? This is where my real journey began.

My mom has been overweight my whole life. Not hamplanet size, more of a small moon but not a fit person. However she learned a lot about health and fitness because of her medical job. 
So she was making efforts to be healthy, and took full responsibility for the way her body looked, there was no fat logic to be found (sorry guys). This is where i learned the fundamentals of a healthy diet, which admittedly she had been trying to teach me for years but i never listened. As for exercise i just looked up some random full body MMA circuit workout. Thus began my transformation. In the months following i struggled to get a routine in order. I worked out 2-3 times a week, and began to restrict what and how much i ate. My goal was to be 195lbs, i would be more than content to be 35lbs lighter. Nothing much happened at first but i began to see minor weight loss, a few pounds or so, enough that it could be chocked up to a loss in water weight. I took it as a sign to try harder, lo and behold a month or so later i was down 10 lbs. Couldn't blame that on water, I was seeing success! 

I kept this pace for around 8 months. Improving my workout and diet as often as possible. It wasn't easy, a lot of days i had to force myself, others i was just physically incapable, I never stopped completely though. I would do something small, anything, my motto during that time was simply "something is better than nothing". 10 push-ups is better than none etc. I couldn't believe what had happened though. Nobody really could. As the dust settled my feeble goal of 195lbs had been shattered beyond recognition. I was 170lbs, I had lost 60, over %25 of my body mass. I honestly couldn't believe it, I still barely can. The only reminder i have of my former self is the stretch marks that litter my body, slowly fading as my skin readjusts. The boost to both my confidence and self-esteem in that moment was palpable, it was as if i was going Super Saiyan.

Since then my fitness efforts have only increased. I've gained around 10 lbs of muscle in the year and a bit since i lost the weight. Old friends couldn't believe their eye's, I had a near constant smile for the first few months until the euphoria wore off. For someone who had not been comfortable with themselves since they were 11, being able to take my shirt off with confidence is just indescribable. My entire life has changed, things look so much better for me. CFS no longer tolls me the way it did since I fined tuned myself, I can play soccer or something with friends without stopping to catch my breath every 5 minutes. Plus my new favorite activity is running, which I consider a big f-u to my former immobile chunky self. 

Thanks for reading everyone and I really hope this doesn't sound like me bragging. I'll answer any questions to the best of my ability. If this is the wrong place to post this let me know. </TEXT>
