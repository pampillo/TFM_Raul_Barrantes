<TEXT> I'm not sure why people are so upset/up-in-arms about this.  FBI Director Comey wasn't personally investigating Trump.  He was delivering briefs about the FBI's investigation.  Also, the investigation is really spear-headed by the Deputy Attorney General who took over when new Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself due to his possible connections to the Russians while involved in Trump's election campaign.

The thing we should be most concerned about is the termination of Attorney General Sally Yates...  Since she warned people of multiple people compromised by Russian intel services, and was repeatedly ignored.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a lot of stuff not **guaranteed** by the constitution.  But then again, the US Constitution was written before our healthcare system was run by for profit corporations and big pharmaceutical companies were overcharging US consumers for medications.

Also, any time an uninsured person (legally in the country or not) goes to a hospital, and the hospital provides services, the costs are passed on to you, the tax payer and adequately insured person.

Technically, neither the ACA nor the AHCA actually provide or guarantee medical services, but rather insurance for coverage should you need it.  And for most healthy people, that's a big **IF**.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The patient was involved in a bad car accident after being shot in the past.  He's really paralyzed from the waist down, legitimately, and unable to walk.

I brought this up to my coworker's attention.  They tried to justify it by saying they had the observation logs labeled incorrectly, and were looking at the wrong log/person.

I reviewed all of the logs, and every log stated someone was walking at some point.  They were unable to show me which log they thought belonged to the paralyzed patient...

So... we'll see how this goes when the supervisors and ethics board find out.  I hate being the one known for snitching on coworkers, but damn.  I ain't about to get sued or fired for knowing some shit and not reporting it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The fact you're biased against cops you've never met makes about as much sense as anyone for being racist or biased against someone due to the color of their skin.

Fortunately,law enforcement officers being intentionally targeted, murdered, or feloniously killed in the line of duty at a very low/rare rate.  Therefore, there is not a very large sample of incidents on which to do a case study.  And considering this was done for only one year makes the sample even smaller.

The fact command staff was interviewed does not take away from "study" aspect of this, as this study does include data/facts as well as suspect statements as to why they did whatever they did.  This is in addition to any anecdotal information provided by command staff or officers who were interviewed.

But thanks for resorting to personal insults and showing me how smart you are. </TEXT>

I also know many people are biased against law enforcement with little to no regard for the law enforcement officer as an individual.  You, obviously, are biased against me without knowing anything about me, except that I portrayed myself to be a police officer (which may or may not actually be true), and may not even be current information. </TEXT>

Everyone in the history of ever has some bias regarding something.  Many can put those biases to the side while they evaluate facts, listen to opinions, and come up with their own decision.  Some people, unfortunately, cannot be open minded, and refuse to reevaluate their own positions despite being presented with new facts. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I don't think that is what a good day is, you did your best and helped someone and that is awesome. But good days aren't days you find out that one wrong move on your part might have ended in someone else's suicide.


Hearing that someone didn't commit suicide because of what you personally made an effort to do doesn't make for a good day?  You have some ultra high standards there, pal.

One wrong move on my part wouldn't have ended up with someone committing suicide unless that wrong move was saying, "hey fuck it man.  We're better off without you.  Here's a gun and a shit load of vodka."

People thinking like this keeps them from helping out sometimes.... ANd that's counterproductive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> All of these could be objective signs of depression, rather than a suicidal person.  There are lots of people who are depressed, but not all of whom are suicidal.

Many times, suicidal people fly under the radar.  Sometimes, they are the person you described who suddenly becomes happy, starts giving away their things, starts speaking in terms of "after they're gone," and so forth.

A *HUGE* contributing factor is alcohol, and a big red flag is sudden withdrawal from an otherwise normal life or from hobbies you know the person used to love. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The story is I did a ride along with a police officer as part of an entry to criminal justice/admin justice course I was taking in college.  During the ride along, the officer tried to stop a car, and got into a high speed chase.

During the chase, the cop followed the suspect through a stop sign and hit a car with some people in it.  At the time, they all said they weren't injured and refused medical treatment.  

Now, a year later, they're apparently suing the department saying the officer was driving like 100mph, no lights or sirens, and never offered them medical attention.

I've been called in as a witness by the police department to say the officer requested an ambulance, and they said they didn't want it.  Also that the officer had his lights and sirens on. </TEXT>

I had only just gained consent to search the vehicle from the driver and sole occupant.

The defense lawyer argued the way my backup officer arrived on scene created a 'coercive environment,' and scared the suspect into consenting due to fear of retaliation.

The judge agreed, and almost threw it out.  Fortunately, I also included in my report, and the DA presented evidence of, the driver was on county probation with a mandatory search/seizure condition, and had lied about it.

The DA and I were able to get everything admitted under the "inevitable discovery" rule.  But ya, almost ruined the entire case because someone wanted to show off for their civilian ride along. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So you're saying that you believe that child is better off never having been born? That's a crappy, judgemental way to think  

If you had seen the things I have, I'm sure you would agree with me.   I was a paramedic when I responded to a sick baby call.

Turns out, the waste of a human life mother bottle fed her baby drano and clorox bleach because she thought the baby was dirty and possessed by evil spirits.  The baby died.   The pathologist who performed the autopsy later described it as the single most horrific autopsy of his 25 year career. 

She also had another two kids chained up in the basement, whom she regularly beat with carpet track strips.

So yes. I think *sometimes*, in some situations the children would have been much better off not being born. 

Although, I'm not saying that about my niece.  She's only 7, but she has told me sometimes she wishes she'd never been born.  I'm more involved than sitting back judging my sister in law.

But to think abortion is murder while seeing examples like these, I have a hard time thinking a fair and just God would punish someone for aborting a fetus before any conscious life even exists.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> . Sure, the legal theory is the police officer is doing a quick pat down, for the officer's safety, to make sure you don't have a weapon. Everyone with any knowledge of what's happening, knows they are looking for drugs. 

Except the pat down its only for weapons and only areas where weapons are readily accessible.  Also, officers are not legally allowed to reach into or remove items from from pockets or closed containers without a warrant, probable cause, or consent. 

So even if a police officer feels what they believe might be drugs in someone's pocket, they cannot legally retrieve it without the aforementioned legal authority. 

Also, I don't know what judges, lawyers, etc, you're yakking to.   All the ones I know do not use the term stop and frisk.   They all use the legal term Terry stop or terry search. 

I've only heard the teem term on tv.  It might be a regional/geographical thing.

That's because as you burn fat, you're building muscle.   Muscle is denser than fat, and weighs more while taking up less space.   That's why your pants don't fit while at the same time you're not losing weight. 

If you're trying to lose weight, stop bulking and doing heavy weights.  Do lighter weights, more reps, and a shit ton of cardio.

That's not true.  "Stop and frisk" was a term coined in areas high in gang and drug crimes.  It's a clever name, nothing more.   It's not made legal by any city council or police department policy. 

It's based on a US Supreme Court decision: Terry vs Ohio.  Terry stops, Terry searches are what the media call frisks.  It's legal everywhere, provided the law officers can well articulate what led to reasonable suspicion, abs ultimately probable cause.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We know drug use isn't higher for African Americans.

Actually, in many areas it is.   Most disadvantaged people of color (blacks predominantly) grow up in "the hood," where criminal violence and sexual assault are rampant.  Growing up witnessing and experiencing these things causes a great deal of PTSD, which often goes undiagnosed and/or untreated.

The most common coping method then becomes self medication with alcohol and drugs.

People on college campuses, as you mentioned, have far less collateral damage caused by their drug use, which is often at a lower rate to start with.   The college kids aren't out shooting up street corners on a regular basis.  They're also not out burglarizing homes or cars to support their habit.  

Thus the target of most drug enforcement becomes controlling the symptoms (shootings, burgs, etc) by targeting the drug users themselves while trying to work up the chain to the dealers.  Sometimes this works, but most organized drug traffic organizations do a fantastic job of protecting the top level people, just like corporations.  The worker bees get screwed.

There's a new book out, and the author just did an AMA yesterday.   The book is titled Narconomics.  And does a phenomenal job explaining that, due to the corporate like structure of Nevin drug cartels (and organized crime), the war on drugs will never really succeed. 

The war on drugs is more like cancer treatment than a cure.   Some areas (people) may have great results and live with cancer/drug problems in remission fir years.   Others may never see any results at all.  </TEXT>

I also visually check people through closed doors/clear windows before opening the back door of the patrol car.  If I can see they're no longer handcuffed, or have moved their cuffs to the front, I let the jail staff know, and they send out a team of people to help prevent escape or attacks on officers.

I haven't added any charges to my arrestees who did that enroute to the jail.  I have added it to people who did something to/with their handcuffs while sitting in houses, sidewalks, etc before transports. </TEXT>

I even have a video I recorded of an inmate showing me how to pick handcuff locks open with a plastic comb.  Handcuffs are only temporary restraint devices that can easily be escaped from.  That's part of the reason a search incident to arrest is not only legal, but a life saving precaution.

EDIT:  To answer the OP's question... Just moving handcuffs to the front, or removing them partially/completely... Is it a violation of the law/can it be considered an escape?  Just like anything else, we can arrest someone for it, and articulate why we believe it's a violation of the law... But still up to the prosecutor's office to determine if they want to file charges in court, and up to a judge and/or jury to determine if it is, in fact, a violation of the law. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I mean, okay? You never had to give the police your ID to begin with, you could just say no. Can they still demand ID for like reports and traffic stops?

The US Supreme Court has ruled no one has to answer identifying questions.  There's also local state laws that have been overturned that previously required presenting ID to an officer during some, but not all, encounters.

For example, California law states you MUST *PRESENT FOR INSPECTION* a valid driver's license if you are stopped for vehicle code violations.  Failure to sufficiently identify yourself during a cite-release/ticket incident falls under CA Vehicle Sections 12951 and CVC 40302.

If a police officer talks to someone and has no legal authority to detain them or arrest them, the subject/suspect in question has no legal requirement to identify themselves.  However, intentionally providing false information does become a crimes, so it's best to just say nothing or, "I decline to identify myself" (or something similar).

<TEXT>  They are not manipulated.

Crime statistics are reported by police departments to city council, the public, researchers, etc.  When I say stats can be manipulated, the easiest way would be to classify certain things either as no crime, or a more minor crime that it really is.  For example, there's a local police department near me that's being accused of doing it pretty routinely.  

For example, shooting into a house that people live in, whether or not they are home, is a violation of California Penal Code 246, and is a felony.  The police department in question has been accused of reclassifying this as a misdemeanor negligent discharge of a firearm (CA PC 246.3) if they either a) believe no one was home at the time, or b) do not have anyone that can corroborate an allegation the house was shot intentionally (even if the house was shot multiple times).

There are a lot of other ways to reduce crime stats as well... So my assertion that "stats can be manipulated" is because I have seen first hand that it does happen.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Correct me if I'm wrong but I'd imagine areas with dispensaries are being policed to avoid a rise in other drugs being sold. Nobody wants an open drug market.  If that is the case, do you really think homeless people will congregate in those areas just because weed is available ? 

This is not necessarily true.  Many of the "upper class" cities near me enacted strict "no medicinal marijuana dispensary" city ordinances as a proactive/preventative measure.  As such, they do not have the issues I'm inquiring about.

On the flip side, I've worked street patrol in some of our lower socioeconomic cities (aka the 'hood).  While there are some legal medicinal dispensaries in these areas, there is also a "normal" black market for drugs, including marijuana.

The other thing that seems to hold true is there are more homeless people living in the "hood" areas, or the lower socioeconomic areas.  Again, this could be due to the fact much of our US law enforcement budget stems from property taxes, and lower property taxes means lower budgets for law enforcement (among other things), which leads to less police presence.  Also, the "homeless problem" is more ignored in these areas because there are other, higher priority, crimes being committed...


Do you think homeless people will travel there because of this availability 

SOme of them do.  I've encountered many homeless/transient people in my small areas who have come from all over.  Some had drug abuse problems before they arrived, but not all.  Many of those who did stated they wanted to find cheaper, more readily accessible drugs.  Some moved to get away, but ended up in an area with an incredibly high supply of drugs.

do you think they are actually using the dispensaries ? In Ireland we have a massive issue with homelessness and heroin and obviously there are correlations between habitual drug addicts and marijuana use but here weed is much more expensive and probably not the first thing a drug addict is going to go spend money on.

I work in a large (both geographically and density) county.  SOme of our cities have a lot of money.  Some are incredibly low income areas.  The higher echelon areas have different drug abuse/addiction problems.  Many teenagers in the well-to-do areas think it's fun to have "Pharm" parties, and they steal prescription drugs from their parents.

Many get addicted to prescription narcotic medications either through sports injuries, or because their parents had them, adn they stole them.  Once they can no longer get their legal supply of prescription narcotic medications (frequently Oxycodone), they purchase those narcotic medications on the street.  However, once they no longer can afford those medications, they end up turning to heroin, which i'm sure you're all too familiar with.

Crystal methamphetamine is a *HUGE* problem here.  There is a large presence of Mexican drug cartel dealers/suppliers in this area.  They supply more crystal methamphetamine than anything else, but can also supply large amounts of heroin, marijuana, cocaine, etc.


Basically, of all the homeless people I've met, talked to, and helped, an overwhelming majority of them abuse street drugs in some way.  But this isn't a surprise.  Many homeless people also have undiagnosed or untreated mental health issues.  The American mental health system is in utter shambles, and always overwhelmed.  Not to mention our medical insurance system is completely fucked up.  This leads people to be unable to obtain the correct medication at a reasonable price, if at all.  They then use illegal street drugs to self medicate.

<TEXT>  As far as a prejudice towards the homeless you seem to have just thrown them in because the topic was drug related.

If you ever encounter a homeless person in the US who doesn't have a drug or alcohol addiction, you've found a unicorn.  I live in the San Francisco/Oakland Bay Area of California, and frequently travel through Berkeley, CA.  There are many homeless people in all of these areas from all over the USA.  The reasons they arrive here are as numerous as the people themselves.  However, there is a common theme many of them have stated when I've asked them "What brought you to this city?"  The answer, frequently, is the prevalence and ease of access to drugs, which includes low prices.

Based on my experience having worked in law enforcement and emergency medical systems for almost 20 years, and the fact I have personally been assigned to homeless outreach programs, I know cities with higher availability of drugs almost universally coincides with a higher homeless population.  I know correlation is not causation.  

My question regarding the homeless wasn't just "throwing them in because the topic is drug related."  It's because I'm honestly curious if there is an increase in the homeless population because Colorado is one of the few, if not the first state, to completely legalize marijuana for recreational use.

Even in California, marijuana is legal to possess for recreational use.   However, there are no dispensaries that can legally sell it to anyone without a physician's recommendation for medicinal marijuana.  Meaning the only dispensaries in the state are for medical users only.  There is no way to legally buy marijuana, even though it's recreationally legal.  And there won't be until some time in 2018.

However, it is legal to give less than one ounce (28 grams) to someone.  It's legal to grow it, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Sweeping assumptions and a prejudice towards the homeless, exactly what you want in a deputy sheriff.

Sweeping assumptions huh?  I guess I could have stated that "I imagine all the other bullshit increased" a bit better.  In California, several recent propositions passed which reduced many felony crimes to misdemeanors (mainly drug related crimes), as well as allowing for early release of inmates.  Both of which have led to an increase in crimes of all sorts.  This coincided with the legalization of recreational marijuana... so it's difficult to say which of these things, if any, contributed more than others.


I'm still trying to figure out where you got that I have a prejudice towards the homeless... 

Do some research.

I'm trying.  Talking to people, asking questions of those with first hand experience is generally called "interviewing."  If you don't think that's a valid form of research, you're pretty odd. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  the majority of the general public supports it being criminalized and people caught smoking weed being heavily penalized, especially the police (which evidently from this post is still the case).

I don't think it should be heavily penalized.  I think there needs to be more information put out to the public regarding the psychotropic effects of it.  The way the "legalize marijuana" movements have been going is somewhat similar to the tobacco issues in the first half of the 1900s.  It wasn't until years later people began suing the tobacco companies for misleading the public related to the dangers.

Then again, the same is true for all advertisements of prescription medication.  I would imagine at some point in the next 20-40 years, our kids and grandkids will think we were horrible ignorant to allow such widespread marketing/advertisement of dangerous prescription medications. </TEXT>

Your point was horribly incorrect.  At least on a broad sense.  It may not be addictive for you.  But that doesn't mean it's not addictive.  Many people are able to consume alcohol without being alcoholics.  Some people cannot drink a single drink without consuming a whole six or 12 pack.  Many of these people cannot go into a bar without falling apart and drinking.... For them, alcohol is incredibly addictive.

Other people can go into a bar, order one beer, drink part of it, and walk away. </TEXT>

I'm well aware that benzos are a class of medication, and pretty much everything else listed is a specific medication name.  It was a bit redundant.  You're right.

As a sidenote, people legally use alcohol recreationally - purely recreationally really. Is it any surprise they use benzos recreationally too? At least a massive benzo overdose will max out GABA receptors before lethality occurs, massive ethanol overdose will kill you.

Which is one of the leading reasons people have attempted to prohibit alcohol, with little success.. Once something is legal, it's virtually impossible to outlaw it.

Alcohol causes more death and damage than most drugs.  More specifically, it's a more widespread problem as opposed to an acute one.  A major factor in that is the fact it's socially acceptable and legal. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Pornography addiction is not a physical addiction.

Read the title of the link you posted.  It specifically says "Physical dependence."  Again, this is very different than "addiction."

First of all, just because a substance is in your body doesn't mean is crosses the blood-brain barrier.  Second, just because a substance is in your body, doesn't mean you're physically addicted to it.

If you're "physically addicted" to something, you're actually dependent on it.  Thus, I attempted to draw a distinction between addiction and dependence.

When people say they're "addicted" to something, typically they're addicted to their body's response to it.  Our brains naturally have a pleasure/reward system in place in which dopamine is released after some event.  Imagine when you were a kid, and you knew your birthday was coming up.  On your birthday, you opened a present, and it was exactly what you wanted.  Your brain releases dopamine, which makes you feel happy.

Another example, imagine you're a high school baseball player.  You have to work hard to make yourself physically ready to perform/play the game.  You hit a home run, and the crowd cheers.  Your brain releases dopamine, and you feel happy or elated.

Drugs and chemicals (caffeine, sugar, cocaine, etc) have the ability to make our brains release dopamine without having to put in a lot of effort.  This is what makes chemicals (or sometimes actions such as sex, food, gambling, video games) so easy to binge on.  Our brain's pleasure-reward system becomes hijacked, or short circuited, and we realize we've found a shortcut that allows us to enjoy the "high" (release of dopamine) without having to do the hard work that used to be required. 

This is where the addiction comes it.  We start to binge, or over indulge (i.e. compulsory behavior) on things such as alcohol, video games, pornography, methamphetamine, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  While I appreciate your knowledge on the issue, as someone that smoked marijuana for years before becoming The Man, I disagree that marijuana is any more addictive than coffee or tea. 

I never said marijuana was any more (or less) addictive than anything else, let alone coffee or tea.  I just said it was addictive.

And to correct your later assertion that marijuana use mimics brain damage; 

That wasn't my assertion, just something quoted from an article I linked to.  It was also stated that it was temporary, which can be said for any Central Nervous System (CNS) depressant.

I have known many highly intelligent, open minded, and self aware people that have used or currently use marijuana.

Many highly intelligent people also consume alcohol.  When they're drunk, do you think they're as highly intelligent as when they're sober?  The same would be true for marijuana.

The thing is, every person is affected differently by any given substance (i.e. caffeine, nicotine, sugar, alcohol, marijuana, crack, whatever).  There are no two people who have exactly the same effects, or even to the same degree as anyone else.

To be clear, I never said/stated/implied anyone who smokes marijuana will have permanent, lasting effects from it.  However, there are studies showing smoking marijuana before a certain age can be a contributing factor to psychosis later in life. </TEXT>

You clearly missed the portion of my post that described the difference between addiction and dependence.

There's a reason we have a type of person called an adrenaline junkie.  They're addicted to the highs produced by high risk activities (i.e. sky diving, extreme sports, etc).  If you think weed isn't addictive just because you don't have physical withdrawal symptoms, you're wrong.

The world has pornography addicts, sex addicts, gambling addicts, etc.  These are just a few examples of physical addictions that don't have withdrawal symptoms.  There's a difference, subtle, but it's there.  Weed is addictive... Just like caffeine, nicotine, sugar, alcohol, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pot isn't a narcotic, but it listed on the federal Schedule 1 drug list.  Marijuana itself has a lot of useful medicinal properties.  However, almost all of those medicinal properties are lost when marijuana is heated up to it's burning point.

Burning marijuana actually activates most of it's psychotropic properties.  This, coupled with the fact, most indoor grown "medicinal" marijuana has been selectively bred/engineered to be more psychotropic than the marijuana used by humans throughout history.

Many people throughout history who have used marijuana for medicinal purposes, or even religious/ceremonial ones, ingested marijuana by eating it (without cooking it), or brewed as a tea.  This ingestion method highlights the medicinal properties of marijuana, while minimizing the psychotropic properties of it.

If anyone is confused as to what "psychotropic" medications are, what they're used for, or why this is a big problem for "recreational" use, answer this:

Would you use any of the following in a recreational way:
Adderall, Abilify, Ambien, Buspar, Benzodiazepines, Cymbalta, Haldol, Klonopin, Paxil, Prozac, Lithium, Seroquel, etc.

I'm not saying people don't use these in a recreational way, but they're controlled because they are all highly addictive and seriously alter brain chemistry.  If anyone thinks marijuana isn't addictive, I would love to speak with you and see if I can change your mind.

Just remember, there's a difference between "addiction" and "dependence."  Opiate narcotics, for example, create a physiological dependence, meaning there are physical withdrawal symptoms associated with their use/abuse.  Alcohol also creates physical dependence.

Many other drugs hijack the brain's dopamine/pleasure/reward system, which creates an addiction, but don't have the same "dependence" problems.  Marijuana certainly is no different. </TEXT>

Sometimes allowing smaller countries to have civil wars without anyone else interceding isn't the worst option.

This is the reason so many citizens who don't have a clue think cops have no business asking them to take their hands out of pockets, stop moving, sit down, or do any of another list of things to remain in control as much as possible. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I ran warrants for a year. No one ever fought. I got into it wanting action, I was sorely disappointed

When the entire warrant unit shows up, people either run or give up.  Not a lot of people actually fight in that situation.  They realize their day has come.

Finding someone on the street who's got a warrant is a whole different situation. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Domestic violence. Hands down. Everytime we had one wed roll two just because of how often you end up getting physical.
 When people are mad or stupid enough to hurt and attack their own family, what's a little violence against police.


This.  So important.  Our department policy (approx 600-700 sworn), is to always have at least 2 responding officers.  We don't have a policy yet mandating 2 officers (or more) actually show up, so as long as the dispatch logs show two responding you're within policy.

The two times I got there before my partner and did not wait resulted in me getting into physical fights with intoxicated people.  More officers are injured or killed responding to DV calls than other call types.

<TEXT> A t-score is used in California by the Police Officer Standards and Training (CA-POST), and can be used in lieu of many agencies in-house written tests.

I've sat on oral boards for interviews/applicants multiple times.  From my experience, you need to balance high test scores (book knowledge) with common sense/street knowledge/life experience.  No one wants a brainy cop who can't talk to people on the street, or who lacks common sense.

Life experience can only be learned through making mistakes, whether they're yours or someone else's that you learned from doesn't matter as much as the fact you learned something and can explain what you've learned.  

Some agencies/departments like to see some sort of volunteer service, as that's one of the cornerstones of all law enforcement agencies.  I have seen a large shift in many law enforcement agencies near me.  Many of them are really revamping and embracing the "community policing" model.  This means they're looking more for community service based models of service, as opposed to proactive/aggressive street level enforcement.

If you want to stand out, make sure you know how you've already helped your community and those around you, as opposed to just helping yourself.  Going to college is great, but make sure you know how to explain how that helps you help others. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  but a lot of "worried well" people with mild anxiety or depression really need friends and lifestyle changes more than anything else. 

This is super important, and often overlooked.  This goes to a bigger picture that shows the stigma attached to mental health.  Also, a lot of people who have mental health issues/problems/illnesses want to find someone/something to blame the problem on, and refuse to accept any responsibility themselves.  They refuse to change their lifestyle or habits (i.e. withdrawing/secluding, alcohol consumption, etc) which exacerbate the problems.

A therapist is only meant to be a temporary solution. 

True.  Too many people want to avoid any sort of therapy because they think they'll be doing it for the rest of their lives.  This leads me to the next part:

The rest of society has to be supportive to welcome them back to normality after they're done with therapy/treatment and the quick fix attitude of our culture is not helpful.

Speaking from the perspective of a North American male adult, our culture is increasingly more fragmented and solitary.  We no longer know our neighbors, and they no longer know us.  We stick to ourselves at work, and avoid being close to too many people.  We make ourselves too busy to know anything about anyone else.

We also are ourselves afraid of being labeled as a mental health "basket case," and avoid addressing the problem because we can then pretend it doesn't exist.

Also, people are more and more unwilling and/or unable to have difficult conversations.  We're no longer comfortable with our feelings and emotions.  We don't want to hear other people's problems because they remind us of our own.  The old family/social structure where neighbors helped neighbors is gone.  We're more and more becoming a "video game/instant gratification" society that's used to pushing a reset button (or going to a game completely) when things don't work out.

Ok. So she's avoiding problems in order to remain comfortable.  She has daddy issues, she left without telling you anything... After seeing this, and realizing these were the reasons your relationship ended, you seriously still think things are your fault? 

It sucks things didn't work out.  I get it.   I've been through my share of breakups, getting dumped, etc. It's never easy.   But, how would things be now if you stayed together for years?  Had kids, a house, shared property that has to be fought over in court? 

Either way, shit, I miss her, but I know she's never speaking to me again. I feel like shit for fucking things up. 

Again, we all know breakups are hard.  But the things that make them hard is no matter how shitty things were, you had some good times.   Remember what you liked, and didn't like.  The next round will be better, you'll be stronger, and you won't let yourself get walked all over.

<TEXT> When most people think of "resisting arrest" charges, the laws are typically written to include resisting, obstructing, or delaying law enforcement officers engaged in performance of lawful duties.

The crime title is often shortened to make it easier to write, but includes more than simply resisting arrest. 

Read california penal code 148 for more information.

US Supreme Court law says police officers can use "objectively reasonable force" in different situations.   One of them being to overcome resistance to lawful authority. 

If a cop asks or tells you to move/come with them, and you refuse they can legally grab you.   If you pull away, you are now resisting.**  More force can reasonably be applied.  But only what's reasonable to another officer with similar training and experience, and only basing decisions on facts known to the officer at the time. 

Granted, cops can't just take off and club people like baby seals, but any new level of resistance can legally justify new higher/increased levels of force used.  

** I understand the laws of arrest... just for the sake of this argument let's assume the officer has the authority to ask you to come with them or force you to do should you refuse. 

Yes, technically you can resist unlawful actions by law enforcement.   BUT most people are not legally trained to know whether they can legally refuse or not, and that's best left determined in court to avoid unnecessary physical or lethal situations.  </TEXT>

No.  Not necessarily true.  If they have (or think they have) exigent circumstances, they can go in with or without consent or a warrant.

<TEXT> After watching a lot of the LCS/MLG/etc matches, and now the worlds group stage games... I cannot help but notice two things:

1) Almost all players buy at least a few wards throughout the early/mid game, if not throughout the entire game...

2) Lots of Bronze/Silver players I encounter talk about watching these matches... but fail to notice that warding is not "the support's job."

I'm sure we can all agree vision can win games, or at least set your team up for success...  Sure buying wards can delay certain items... but increased vision can prevent ganks, or unnecessary deaths.  This means the enemy team either wastes times on ganks that fail, or at the very least you deny them gold from kills.  So the tradeoff is actually in your favor for warding.

What can we do to increase people's understanding of the correlation between warding and increasing your team's chance to win? </TEXT>

<TEXT> From LoL Wiki: Gold equal to 50% of the amount the killer receives is put in a pot which is split equally among all champions who scored an assist.

So, unless it's a decent amount for shutdown, the cost of the ward would generally offset the amount of gold given for an assist.  Given this fact, and anyone who has to roam to drop a ward to get the assist would lose more than they would gain due to not getting the CS... The whole situation naturally deters people from spamming wards and warding to get sight ward assist gold anyway... Unless I'm missing something... </TEXT>

As far as people "spamming wards" during a team fight.. if they're there already, they're already going to get an assist, as well as the gold that goes with it.

If you think giving an assist and usual amount of gold for a ward assist is a problem it could be lowered, I guess... But... I play support almost exclusively...   And I can tell you that I get assists for something as simple as throwing a thresh lantern onto someone just before they get a last hit on a champ... The shield doesn't have to do anything... But gives me an assist.

The same is true for any support ability that hits any champ just before they get a kill, no matter how insignificant it actually was in the fight overall. </TEXT>

Garen's spin and auto attacks don't deal much damage at all.  His ulti is dangerous to low health people, which again, is why i think Kayle is my favorite counter to Garen.

Garen's Ulti:
------------
Cooldown: 160 / 120 / 80
Magic Damage: 175 / 350 / 525 (+ 29 / 33 / 40% of target's missing health) 

Kayle's Ulti:
------------

He'll naturally push the lane towards your tower, thus giving your mid and/or jungler (assuming your have one) a chance to gank him when he's over-extended.  Pretty soon he'll stop, or you'll all get fed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't even count the times people have bullied others into picking certain champs because "d00d, ryze counters fizz soooo hard.  easy win bro."  The problem is, the guy picking Ryze has never played him, has little to no idea the mechanics of ryze, or how to engage/disengage, CS, or poke properly.  Counter picking doesn't mean shit if you don't know the reason one champ is weak against another champ.

For example, Caitlyn counters Ez and Draven very well.  But that doesn't mean a certain win.  If you have no idea that for Cait to counter Ez it's about harass, rather than pure damage... and in order to do that you need to stand in minion waves so Ez's Q can't hit you, and his AA range is shorter than yours... Then it's pointless.  If you don't know that as Cait you're supposed to be dropping traps on Draven's spinning axe marked locations, then you're probably going to lose.

The same is true with supports.  I've beaten so many Jannas as Leona because people don't know how to anticipate my engages.  Or they don't ward properly... or they simply don't know how to use Janna's tornadoes properly.  Many lane match-ups aren't just an all in fest.  It's a waiting game to see who makes the first mistake... usually it's the person who gets bored and over eager first.  They waste their stun/initiate on my ADC, I go in and stun/engage on their ADC.  By the time their ADC is out of the CC combos, my ADC has already landed a few abilities or AAs and disengages.  The same is true for top/mid lane.   Anticipate when someones going to try to CS.  Poke them when they CS, and then back off.  They either return the trade with you, and miss the CS, or they take the CS and the damage you put out, but they cant return it.  Either way, youre giving yourself a tiny advantage.  Those advantages start adding up, but its slow.  However, they can be thrown away in an instant.

The best way to move up is to be patient.  Don't force fights that don't need to happen.  Think things through.  Why are you going for an engage/fight? Can you kill the other person?  If not, you shouldn't be fighting.  Poking/harassing is different.  If you can get a few small shots off on them, and then move away, you won the trade.  Win a few trades and they have to base.  

Even if you don't kill the opposing laner, you forced them out of the lane which means:
1) They lose CS (meaning money and exp) and you get ahead in both.  Making you stronger than them. 
2) you can force your minion wave to their tower, meaning they lose more money, and you can roam to help another lane and help your teammates.
3) You can take their tower.  This is an objective based game.  I'm sure we all have had games in which our team was "winning" in terms of kills, but we still lost.  We won all the team fights, but no one took towers or objectives after team fights.

Just be patient, think through your actions.  And  take responsibility for your mistakes.  Learn from them, and make sure they dont happen often, or at all.  Once you identify a leak in your game, you can fix it.  Pretty soon youll be movin on up.

<TEXT> One of the things i've learned, and still have a hard time applying, is everyone (yes, even you), makes mistakes.  You might be be the BestMidLane/BestADCNA, but if you're 10/0/2, you don't need to get to 20 kills, or 15, to show how awesome you are.  The best thing to do is start letting your teammates get some kills.  Otherwise, you'll be the only person with gold and items, and you will most likely be nuked down instantly in team fights, leaving your already fallen behind team at a huge disadvantage.

TL;DR: Remember, this is a team game.  It is very difficult to win 1vs5.   If you're ahead, pull your team up with you, don't leave them in the dust showing how good you are. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Thresh FPS/Lag bug back? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-06-08 19:33:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Has anyone else had performance problems when playing against a thresh, or any other champ?  I just played 4 games in a row, two of which had a thresh in them on the enemy team.  In each of the thresh games, I had severe problems with what appeared to be lag.  

The weird thing was, I was listening to Pandora at the time, and not once did pandora lag.  Also, my latency in game never seemed to go above 35ms.  My FPS seemed to stay steady at 60.  However, my chat, ability and item use, and even movement was delayed and extremely sluggish whenever thresh was near, even near but in Fog of war.

Has anyone else noticed this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to play Nami support in ranked matches almost exclusively, and at one point had over 60% win rate with her.  I'm not the best player, and I'm still learning, so I could very well be wrong on some of the things I say...

One thing I have learned about nami is she is very much a poke oriented champ, like Lulu.  Given the fact Nami's ranged, and her W will either damage two opponents, and heal once, or Damage once, heal twice, AND her Q does damage... you can see she's designed to be played aggressively.  But this means you need to be playing with an ADC who is also aggressive.

Her Q is hard to land when you first start playing her, and is easy to dodge by some champs (Ezreal, Graves, Vayne, etc)... thus making her more difficult to play than someone with a target-based stun (Taric, etc).  However, when you do land your Q, you deal some damage, and if you're good with quick autoattacks, you can deal just a bit more poke... 

The biggest problem I faced when playing support initially was CCing when the ADC was not able to follow up.  There were times I was mad the ADC was "useless," and only farmed, but I slowly realized at least part of the blame was mine.  If you're going to play support, you must learn not to CC or overextend when your ADC mate is not able to follow up.  Theoretically, the higher ELO/rank people get, the more they're paying attention and anticipate and will position themselves to follow up.

Also, keep in mind Nami's Ultimate is slow and easy to dodge if people are close to the edges already, or have flash/ghost up.  The best way to cast it, then, is from fog of war, bushes, or further back so people aren't looking directly at you.  One item I build on Nami frequently is Kage's pick into Twin Shadows.  Just use the twin shadows to slow, then Ulti (which also slows), and then Q on the mfor the hard CC.  But again, don't do it unless you have backup and people to followup.

As for playing other support champs, don't play the "popular" ones just because they're popular.  However, they are popular for a reason... You should learn why, for each champ, and practice.  Taric used to be a pick and win champ, but not so much any more since his passive changed.  Taric is still good, but if you play nami well, you'll soon realize Nami is a great counter to Taric, and in my opinion, a better pick than taric now.

<TITLE> Why nerf/balance/tweak all champs? </TITLE>

<TEXT> I don't play dominion.  I don't play twisted treeline.  I play ARAM, and I play 5v5 Summoner's Rift.  That being said... there are some items only available on the Crystal Scar.  There are some items only available on Twisted treeline.... And there are some items only available on Summoner's Rift.... Then there are items available on any combination of the above...

So... why are all champions balanced across all three game types and maps?  Why not have some champs available on Twisted Treeline (3v3), or Crystal Scar (Dominion), or Summoner's Rift (5vs5)....  Why nerf/edit/buff/change/tweak/balance a champ across all maps simply because it is over(used/powered/banned/played) on any given map/game? </TEXT>

<TITLE> MSVCP80.dll missing? WTF? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-02-02 06:20:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After eagerly awaiting the NA servers to come online today, I finally managed to get in and play.... I played one ranked game, and lost.  The second ranked game I queued for I had three people claim top, and lock in TP/flash toplane champs (wukong, riven, and darius).... I dodged... And went to -3 LP.  After taking a break for a few hours, cooking dinner for my family, I came back to play... Downloaded another patch, and tried to queue for ranked...  Went through champ select no problem, and as soon as the match started, I got an error message saying I couldn't load the game.

Messages says "League of Legends.exe"  The program can't start because MSVCP80.dll is missing from your computer.  Try re-installing the program to fix this problem.

WTF. Running repair option from the login screen, but there's no way I will connect before the match is lost, or even started.  I can log in just fine... and when I do I get the window saying I left a game in progress, and have the "reconnect" button to click... which produces the same error message.

EDIT:  Fixed it.  Found an old thread on the LoL NA forums:  Basically

Go to C:\Riot Games\League of Legends\RADS\solutions\lol_game_client_sln\releases   (or wherever your install location is), and delete the folder 0.0.0.209 (or whatever the most recent one is).  Should be the file/folder with today's current date.  Playing (level 1 while everyone else is 10 or 11..  Best support NA time...

Dafuq?  Now I get to lose more league points, and fuck over my team. GG Riot. </TEXT>

People have to learn to play... Some bad players play bots...some 5s, some ranked.... Either way...  I was bad at some point....worse than I am now... I didn't get reported then, and I refuse to report now...

Either way..... It was funny...  i've been on both sides...and still haven't reported people for it....  Just laugh, lose 20 minutes of your day, and move on... If you can't afford to lose 30 minutes of your day due to someone fucking up your video game experience, perhaps you shouldn't play online-multiplayer games...  Try Tetris.  Or angry birds. </TEXT>
