<TEXT> Yeah man I got flawless using it on my at the time 420 cp Magsorc, (first try I'll add). I didn't really have a choice tho, didn't have ANY illam or groth shoulders. But hey, free 10k shield with near 100% uptime. Put some cp into bastion if you do go this route.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> "SB" was found written on my door frame at my apt, about the same height as the dead bolt. The letters are around 1" high, written in pencil.
  
Theory 1- SB stands for the initials of a maintenance person. After checking out hvac + sprinkler heads.
  
Theory 2- SB stands for single blond. 
  
What do you folks think. Should I be alarmed?
  
I'm not the blond but my gf is, obvs not single but if it was a casing of the place I could have been absent, but her present. </TEXT>

Full divines necropotence, gold mats to gold it
More gold mats
More gold mats
Around 1000 spell power pots
A ton of tanking gear, dragon armor/weps, werewolf hide
Inventory space for all Alts and bank
Guild raffles
  
I bought an extra 30 rosin or so to sell after morrowind drops, I have a feeling more staves/traits will be viable and rosin will get a hike in price. Could be wrong, since it's the cheapest gold mat </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some tips for dungeon healing - at your stage in the game, chances are your group DPS will be pretty low, so instead of full on healing- do dps! Templars have a great spammable that is an area come that also heals you. It's almost god mode while hitting targets, use this to help your group clear mobs and bosses. As for heals- drop your area heals and heals over time, then do DPS, reapplying those heals of the group needs them. Use honor the dead or breath of life for the harder bosses, or when a group mate takes a huge hit. This is your strongest heal. You should be able to get thru any group dungeon with sweeps, harness magic, and breath/honor. Pro tip- 2-3 sweeps then reapply all your dots/hots. This is your rotation. When you get into harder content you can become a full blown healer, but having dps early on in the game will help you immensely. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey!
  
Looking to break 40k Dps on the skeleton. I'm bouncing btwn julianos and md w/ groth as well as BSW, md, and groth. My highest is with BSW at 38.1k, but I am more consistent with juli at around 37k. Rotation is empower heavy trap spear wall swap reflective sweep sweep purifying swap spear wall ritual swap. I swap on purifies and (ritual or trap, alternating). Meteor for ult right before first bar swap. So pretty much 2 sweeps and dots til around 30% and then execute light weave. LAs throughout each skill, am high elf, maxed out gear with undaunted (except infused shoulder :/.)
  
I have someone giving me synergies for MD and ele drain. 
  
Any suggestions? Any gameclips? I can post mine when I leave work and record a new one, if anyone would like to crit the clip. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally, I'd go with BSW or spinners. Spinners would be better. SM 2-4 piece bonuses aren't as good as BSW or Spinners. Plus, you get more upfront damage with spinners, no proc necessary. BSW procs for me when I don't want it and when I want it it hardly does, so I'm not a fan of it in PVP unless it's on a magdk. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are 4, twelve man trials, with normal and hard mode (veteran) and an extra hard mode for the last boss on vet. That and the DLC HM Vet dungeons are considered the "end-game" in PVE. There is also VMA if you're into solo leaderboards. A lot of content for end-game, huge learning curve, huge gear grind- taking place in trials for BiS gear, as well as vanilla dungeons.
  
I encourage you to check out veteran HM trial clears on YouTube, to get a sense of what the combat and gameplay is like. It's incredibly fun- I'm still captivated by vMoL, and the craglorn trials.

Use force pulse not crushing. Get moondancer or IA jewelry. USE ALL DIVINES, thief mundus. If you're always using the pet, get daedric prey morph and front bar it(swap cancel this when switching bars), back bar execute. On your back bar hit the pet ability when you swap back to the front.
  
Watch Alcast's 2 sorc build videos for homestead. Particularly when he's fighting the dummy.

It may have been because we all had our tin-foil hats on tight- audio off, quest markers/compasses off, no combat text, no name plates, polymorphs on, etc.

<TEXT> Yeah I had a hard time reading that rhetoric as well. Exhibit A would have to be how the Germans treated partisans on the eastern front. Essentially hitler created a decree by which if a partisan is behind enemy lines, they were fair game, to death. With their lightning fast advances, everything could be behind their lines.
  
Also to note- what the Germans did to partisans and Russians provoked the Russians I into giving payback. It was a horrible war for downward spirals of payback. </TEXT>

If you want to maximize dps you will have alchemy maxed out for the laboratory passive, increases potion length. If you do everything I listed and really get your rotation down you could push some serious dps. Also get sharpened VMA daggers. There are a few videos online by alcast to max alchemy fast and get your rotations down. YouTube him and check out his content </TEXT>

<TEXT> A few things I noticed: you can take off either SA or rapid strikes, pick one. If you're running solo content then drop the Rapids.  You can also drop camo hunter and flying blade, use weapon power/crit pots. They aren't as expensive now that you can get satchels with telvar and a lot of "free water" in the alliance bases in imp sewers.
  
Now with those 3 skills off your bars you can add rearming trap, blood craze(or other morph), and poison injection. The trap and poison are nonnegotiable. The blood craze can swap to steel nado.
  
I'd probably front bar Rend (DW ulti) and slot incap strike on back bar. Use incap when boss is close to 25% health.
  
This change should up your deeps significantly, and provide more survivability with HOTs like rend and blood craze.
  
Also look up a popular and up to date build and copy their CP. don't know mine offhand </TEXT>

<TEXT> Originally AVA was designed to have many more hundreds of players participating. They've scaled it back due to performance issues, but didn't scale the map size back. I agree there isn't much incentive on the peripheral POIs, if there was more interest, maybe that would deal with Zerg balls. But as it is, people see 1 big battle and go to it, the other battles are a 30 min ride across the map (exaggeration but it's very far). If the map was smaller and denser, there would be more fights throughout, more entropy, and more places to go! I know it seems counter-intuitive, but I think it could work better, smaller. Then again it might just turn into 3 zerged at Alesia and nothing changes except riding times.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Looking at picking up a PC copy of ESO. A few friends and I decided to give PC a whirl, as Xbox has let us down a few times now. Theres around 12 of us, all have completed vMOL and a few, not myself, are quite high up in PVP greatness (if thats a thing.) 
  
Anyway, I'm about to download it, was thinking Steam. Any issues there? 
  
Also, a few other random questions:
Any not-so-well-known add ons you like?
Can anyone craft me training gear at 10-15 level intervals?
What are some great PVP and PVE guilds? Who to connect with?

  
Anything else, just let me know!
  
Thanks all.

Make sure you enchant all gear. If you're stam use hundings, magic use julianos. There are other options but that'll get you started on gear progression.

I had someone in my raid group last night urging me to not run Noxious, as it overrides Pierce Armor. Can anyone shed some light on this so I don't have to test it later? This was the only time I've heard this.
  
I've heard of similar debuff skill stacking issues, with ele drain/pierce armor. 
  
Regardless, your thoughts and expert opinions are appreciated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love ESO. It's an amazing game. I've been playing since its launch in Xbox and have learned so much, made tons of friends, and really progressed in this game and all of its difficult content.
  
The day before the patch that broke minor slayer and vMOL I almost had my first complete with my group. Brought the twins down to 3% and shortly after a few more tries, we called it a night.
  
Please fix this soon. It is absurd this hasn't been addressed (really addressed, not just telling us 'soon') we bought the game, we are subbed, we purchased the content and the content is broken. Fix it please. Should have been fixed over a month ago. Why hasn't it?
  
Sorry if this has already been asked, there are already over 350 comments at this point.

<TEXT> I'm personally on the fence about it. I see both of your points and totally agree that melee should absolutely pull more dps than ranged. 10-20% more IMO. That being said I do think a nerf was warranted, keeping in mind the TG patch where flurry cast time was reduced, the weapons weren't compensated accordingly. Now I do think this nerf was a tad heavy-handed but like you said, in the end it will still be on top.

<TEXT> They are essentially worthless for trading after the time window... So why would you even charge? Maybe a tip sure... But if you didn't need it then what's the point?
  
That's what I don't understand about bop trading. If you don't need it, and someone else wants it, give it to them. Otherwise it's not ever being used in your bank.
  
I understand selling the item only if you actually need it for a toon. I sold a precise moon dancer sword for 100k because I legitimately wanted it for my Templar alt, but a group mate needed it for his main to complete the set. I still think I overcharged him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah my stam sorc is dot heavy in PVP. Dual axes, hurricane, blade clock, tendon. Slashes, bloodthirst, poison inject, and arrow barrage, flawless DB, steel tornado. It's awesome.... Catch a ton of people off guard by the rolling dot ticks. In 1vx situations it performs quite well with barrage, hurri and steel tornado. It's inherently tanky as you have major resistances up always, minors too with bound arms, and bloodthirst keeping your health topped off. 
  
VMA axes are critical for the build to really shine.
  
5 hundings impen, 5 VO, 2 VMA. Could run this with agility/endurance and skoria instead of VO but the speed and sustain from vicious in Zerg fights is pretty exceptional  </TEXT>

Then head over to orsinium public dungeons. This is great for alt characters, since you'll be low on skill points. Orsinium spots are also great for champ point grinding.
  
Also keep in mind there is a huge bonus on the activity finder once a day, get a group of four THEN start queue. And do all of the normal/vet dungeons for skill points and undaunted xp.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> All I said was healing springs. There are many cases where, if you want to live, you need to be in healing springs. You took that and ran with it ridiculously far. And you were being a dick about it. Bow/bow just doesn't work. Read through the comments throughout your thread and that illustrates why this is the case. Like you said, you need to be x far away for bow to be on par with wrecking blow. That's outside of healing springs, you're a liability in most end game trial content for that reason. You're a liability because your dps is shit. You're also toxic to be around so fuck it you're a liability in that regard. Thank you, good day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Haven't had any viscous O drops since my luck is shit but 3 agility, 5 tbs, mael dagger precise and axe sharp, I swap in either Mephala or bloodspawn occasionally. (This is for maelstrom). Bars- DW: venom claw, bloodthirst, bloodcraze, igneous, vigor, flawless DB. Bow: rearming, poison inject, endless hail, flappy wings, noxious breath, standard. My high score on VMA is 480k. Just got thru vSO last week also. Not sure how else I can optimize my rotations- should I be light/heavy weaving thru literally everything? 
  
Stamblade is essentially the same setup, with killers blade, siphoning, and relentless in place of the dk skills. Same gear and weaps.  Seem to have more survivability issues with him though, as I have to eat all the damage rather than reflect/shield it. Any suggestions on staying alive better with him? Blur/shuffle? Or just gitgud and roll dodge more/defense harder?

I realize you're aiming for pvp, in which case it would be different, however, dark elf magblade is good shit for min/maxing in pve. Weaving and ele blockade, shooting star... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Planning my next stam char. The sorc would be a khajiit and the stamplar probably redguard. What would you all recommend and why? I have all the endgame gear already (just not viscous ophidian jewelry.) already have a stamdk and stamblade. Only have 1 char slot left if I don't delete a toon. ;) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dominion bow is a 3 piece set. It's really only used for the unresistable damage enchant. Not the set bonuses. Vice cannon seemed cool at first but it's subpar in pvp as everything is cut in half as far as dam and healing </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah that's my build pretty much. I stopped running DW unless it's for trials. Normally I'll run resto back bar or destro/destro (for the spell damage enchant). Sometimes I'll off heal trials with resto too. Lots of flexibility.
  
Some good sets to look into-
TBS-thief and shadow
Julianos
Scathing mage(must be all divines)
Kena(always proc, light attack weave always)
Nerienth
  
Important things to keep in mind. Flame damage!!!!! Get an inferno mael staff sharpened or precise. Shooting star is your main ultimate. Soul harvest back bar for executes.
  
Typical bars- merciless resolve, swallow soul, impale, inner light, ele blockade, shooting star, soul harvest sap essence, harness magicka, siphoning attacks, rapid regen, healing ward, reapers mark, refreshing path(twisting if you use scathing) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good direction for both. I'd probably use 5 hundings- 5 marksman with a dominion/pact/covenant bow for the unresistable enchant for pvp. Head shoulders jewelry marksman, rest hundings. I use that setup but with the mael bow, and it's really well balanced as far as sustain/damage output. Try using a 2h in PVP as well, that helps a good bit (and less expensive). 
  
Pve looks good. I'd probably put rearming trap on the DW bar for passive dam increase </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are still skill points from the main quest line in each zone. The xp gain isn't negligible, contrary to what others said. The items drops are though. Keep doing the daily pledges, hold onto all your keys til cp160. Keep leveling mages and fighters guilds and don't worry about over leveling too much for your zone. Some like to power level and disregard quests, others do 'completionism' on one character and grind the rest. Lots of freedom already with how you want to play. One Tamriel is still a ways out so no reason to wait til then IMO. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just tested this out on my stam dk on console - live. Molten armaments, camo hunter, heavy bow attack in pvp immediately followed by a poison injection will kill most things instantly. Very viable. Instead of using it always as part of rotation I use it to begin a fight from stealth, stampede in and dos to finish it off if the initial burst doesn't work. Works great with gank dk builds, but I find this to shine in pvp as it completely sets classes off balance and puts them on the defense right off the bat, if it doesn't insta-kill them. 
  
I recommend not using HA in combat outside of animation cancelling or cleaning up someone else's fight from far away when the pressure isn't on you. </TEXT>

5 julianos
2 kena
1 torugs (in lieu of maelstrom)

Destro/resto

Fight- buff merciless resolve, structured entropy(or sap essence.) Medium attack weave swallow soul/ funnel health (twice), then two consecutive light attacks for kena proc. Then structured entropy for empower buff (might of the guild passive in mages guild) then spectral bow proc from merciless. Consistently hits between 32-40k depending on buffs from group mates.
  
Alternatively you can do the same buffs, proc kena, proc empower, then drop a meteor on some unlucky soul.
  
So, essentially, minor brutality, major sorcery, kena, empower, meteor/spectral bow, repeat </TEXT>

<TEXT> Man I've had a hard time finding the right group for vICP farming. Best we've gone was bringing Ibomez down to 10% before the flesh enrages. Xbone. 
  
I agree about the traits on end game gear. To some extent that is how it's done, I think. I haven't gotten a training spc piece or anything like that. I do think that ZOS wants us to sprint around everywhere though. Everything is well-fitted. This game and its development boggles me man.

<TEXT> You're going to want to level as dps before going full on tank. Tank 1-VR16 would take ages. We don't want dis. Level tanks skills up while you're dps-leveling. And when you're ready for some mid-end-game content respec a few skills and Passives to focus on tanking. Say VR3 or so? Depends on player. As for race/class/build- all are viable. Some better than others for endgame...also depends on if you want full on tank, tank with some dps, dps with some tank, heals with tank yadayada...PVP?PVE? NB tanks are great for dps tanking and are very capable for end game content. DKs are the assumed tank class. Sorcs are less seen as tanks but are very,very, capable. Temps are heal tanks.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey again. I've experimented with both. Right now it's the ranged version as dps and tank. If I'm not currently engaged but I can summon the shade it will spawn on me and not begin attacking until I initiate. The teleport ability is quite nice in some boss mechanics and adds a layer of mobility that is really fun and intriguing to play around with. The teleport works from quite far away too, and I think is available for the majority of the ability's duration (only 1 teleport per summon).  In pvp it's also quite fun. As I like to 1vx, when say 3 reds pile on me I'll teleport off 20 yards or so and completely confuse them. Regain my composure and reinitiate my smackdown. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Been trying to acquire spell power cure and brands of imperium sets. RNG hates me. What would be more efficient, play on vet 16 for 16 gear at higher rates but lower completion time or normal 16 for 15 gear, lower drop rates and faster completion time? We finish it very quickly on normal. Done it around 20 times recently - 3 spell power drops and 2 imperium drops. For some reason it's also almost always well fitted. This game is fxking ridiculous with RNG. Plenty of harvest dirks and lost hatchets tho! </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is true. They both work great though. Do what you feel is best for your personal enjoyment and growth. I respeced my stamblade at vet9 to a nightblade Magicka tank. And the best part is? I can respec back whenever I want. Just need around 13k gold which is easy to come by. Just do you homie. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The main intent of fire sprinkler design ( or any life safety feature) is  limiting the time it takes for the fire to spread, therefore increasing the time for evac. Not to extinguish. Corridor fireproofing isn't necessary (tmk) unless is is explicitly part of the egress enclosure. 
  
This fire shouldn't have spread the way it did. This building type is non combustible IA construction. There must have been a significant problem with fireblocking and insulation type. One that would allow it to jump levels as quickly as it did. There really aren't that many combustible materials in this structure, crazy how fast it was all engulfed.

Ninja edit- sprinklers are req'd. Adding sprinklers allows for building height and area modifications. Ex- non sprinklered 3a construction (light wood) is maxed out at 65' high, 4 stories, and an area I can't remember off hand. With sprinklers it is allowable at 6 stories and 85' in height. Same concept applies to tall IA structures. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great post man, just the person I wanted to talk to.
  
I hear you on hist bark. I've been debating and testing it compared to mirage and I think you're right. It was nice having another slot for a skill, but better can be achieved.
  
Pariah is an interesting concept, I like it so far but the general consensus is what you illustrated. It's better than what most are saying but the root of the idea at 100% isn't great at all. I have a feeling they might up the 100% mitigation to proc at 60% health in future updates. Still the principle argument remains.
  
Juggernaut is what I'm working towards acquiring to test out next. Already have a few pieces. There aren't any jewelry drops for this right? 
  
Whitestrakes is pretty good, I tried it before going hist bark and think I'll go back. Maybe compare with jug and see what's up.
  
Leveling up resto right now. What are your go to skills/morphs? General advice? Haven't touched or even thought about going this path until about a month ago when I realized the potential utility.
  
Such a fun class/ play style. Was greatly surprised at how much fun it was when I respeced from a glass cannon stamblade. Now I can tank anything. Haven't tried it on prison yet though ;).
  
I appreciate your input/thoughts my friend. You wouldn't happen to be on AD NA Xbox? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good read. Makes my brain hurt with all this math you threw at me but I'm embracing the beauty of the numbers. The OP is quite talented in his breakdowns. Biggest thing I found out is infused on the 3 large pieces with the rest divines is the way to go depending on Mundus stones. 
  
I'm about to start crafting V16 gear for my NB sap tank. Wanted to figure this out before I start upgrading things to gold ;). Y'all have thoughts on 5 hist bark 5 pariah and 2 bloodspawn/malubeth? I've seen some flak over the pariah set but after trying it out in a huge group of ~20 adds it seems to work really well. Might pair well with orgnums scales also. </TEXT>

<TEXT> People want to cheese bosses when farming for the engine guardian set (or other sets for that matter) in order to speed up the process. So more tries to get the monster helm in a shorter time frame. Kind of a dick move to disband the group over the principle of cheesing, but to each is own... I will say that the group finder tool isn't ideal for farming monster helms. For obvious reasons. </TEXT>

<TEXT> YouTube/Google the sap mania 2.0 build. It's the basis of my khajiit Magicka tank build. First and foremost I have to say that I LOVE playing with this build. Very active, powerful, and rewarding. My build began as a Stam blade glass cannon til vet 8 when I respec'd to Magicka tank. So happy I did. Sap essence, swallow soul, siphoning attacks, caltrops, twisting path, puncture armor, inner fire, mirage, and the twin blade and blunt passive of dual wield (swords) are typically on my bars. Right now I'm using 5 piece seducer and 3 piece Magnus and 3 piece willpower in jewelry. PM me if you ever have questions about nightblade sap tank builds. I'm vet 11 and can tank almost everything. Save imp prison-wgt. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Khajiit here,

Vet 8 stamina nightblade - Bow, DW, 2H.
  
I like to PVP and run vet pledges.
  
Was wondering what is a good benchmark for things like weapon dmg, Stam recovery, max health and max Stam. Phys. and spell resist too.
  
Your expert thoughts are highly appreciated. Xbone NA if that matters, probably doesn't.

<TEXT> khajiit stamblade here. I found for PVP and PVE that 2h and bow work incredibly well. I tried 1h and shield prior to vet levels and think it's better for tanking moreso than typical night blade builds. 
  
My bars-
2h: rally, vigor, killer's blade, wrecking blow, brawler(or critical charge or ambush)

Bow- poison injection, focused aim, bombard (or reapers mark) camo hunter(or double take) siphoning strikes(or dark cloak)
  
I change up the skills depending on the situation(PVP,PVE,boss,adds) just depends.
  
Ults- veil or blades/soul assault
  
I'm leveling up DW to replace 2h currently.
  
Edit: check out the spectre on Deltias gaming. Basically the same build but he uses a couple different skills </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with all the other comments- grids in lumion are distracting, fenestration at the front a little heavy-handed, way too much of it and without any environmental controls other than the mulls and sashes themselves.  More context in the renders would help understand scale as well as how successful the project is from the get go.
  
IMO the rear elevation( facing pool, courtyard) would probably be best as the front elevation, still with a little tweaking though, on both. This would aid in privacy, as well as environmental controls. Program arrangement seems ok, a floor plan would be nice but I understand this was a rendering/modeling exercise. 
  
Office oriented towards courtyard at the rear would also be a good call, most likely.
  
Take what I say with a grain of salt. Just graduated from arch. school. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Back in HS- I stayed home from school to play hookie( COD4 ). After my morning shower I put on a bathrobe. TWO MOTHERFUCKEN WASPS inside it. Bit/stung like crazy, ditched to robe and bolted around the house buck-nekkid. Didn't know they were wasps until I investigated the robe and was promptly hit by them a couple more times. I then killt them.
  
After this encounter, went over to Le Home Depot for TWO CANS OF WASP KILLER. These cans had raaaaange I tell ya. 12 feet accurately. 
  
Went onto the roof and had a blast, one can in each hand. Must have killed a couple dozen outside my room and on the roof. Eventually ran out of juice, with a couple stragglers floating around in despair. So I flipped the can over for dramatic effect, swatted the wasp onto the ground and CURB STOMPED THE SHIT OUT OF THE WASP.

TL;DR - FUCK WASPS, call me if you got a problem </TEXT>

Brooklyn, NY. Great for understanding diversity, urbanity, and the collective whole of a community. Bad for crazy people, nature is pretty distant (Appalachia). Always something to do.
  
Lake Tahoe, NY/CA. Great for nature, backyard was a mountain. Lack of diversity, both in race and $$. Beautiful mountains and beaches. Lots of outdoor activity and happy, chill people. May dump 4ft of snow overnight. School still in session.
  
Atlanta, GA. A mix of both worlds. Great people, urban feel(still sprawled) but with a huge density of foliage and trees. And chic-fil-a. Bad for the occasional racism. Shitty suburban cops. No beaches. Great pools.
  
About to head back to one of those three for a professional career. Guess which. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sounds like part of a joke.

I have 2 inch diameter EMT aluminum and am attempting to adhere/attach it somehow to the face of stained plywood. Inserting globe lights inside. 
  
Suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
  
I was planning on cutting a sort of notch in the face of the wood to give more surface area for gorilla glue(?) to do its work. Depth 1/8" and enough of an opening to grip the tube. Pipes will be around 3" long so not much of a cantilever.


I'm basically creating a marquee letter in the shape of the letter A. This is my second one so I'm trying out the pipe method rather than sheathing 6" flashing around the edges- finishing this method with the letter k currently. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey Mr. Hawk, huge fan of your skating, games, and movies. Particularly THPS2 and the Bones brigade. 
  

Probably had a better question for you when I was 12 (22 now) but here it goes:
  
  
If you were to choose any sport to be exceptional at, like Tiger is to golf or Tony is to skating, what would it be? 
  
  
How do your conversations with Rodney Mullen go? Creativity is skateboarding as a focus.
  

PS I sat behind your family at boom boom huck jam in NY  back in the early 2000's. Unbelievably awesome show. Social D!

<TEXT> Very well put together response sir, you've already been immensely helpful. The particle board was an arbitrarily made decision(10$ cheaper than MDF) and that under layer is only to provide some stability to the thin 1/4" walnut ply. The reason why I didn't use another walnut ply is to be economical as it is the underside of the table. The glass will either be held in place by its own static friction or may use silicone at the corners to raise it slightly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks bud. A quality aesthetic is absolutely a requirement, I'll post the the updated iterations of the legs once I get to rendering this weekend. The technical drawings and programming are critical, but the tolerance may be problematic with the seasonal expansions. 
The table is as follows:
1/4" walnut veneered plywood and 1/4" inch cherry(inset)
5/8" particle board

What kind of expansion can I expect to see? How to alter design with this in mind? Any tips on laminating/connecting walnut plywood to particle board to structure of table?

Thanks again everyone!

<TEXT> It is bold, I like bold. I'll elaborate-the majority of furniture designs I've seen that are heavy on the CNC router are focused on flat-packing or complete CNC fabrication. The process of cutting out a pattern and fitting it with its infill counterpart isn't seen as much(in the scope of CNC routing furniture). The overall process of pattern/infill in furniture design has been around for ages; what makes this special is the tolerance of the CNC's measure- something like a 10,000th of an inch? </TEXT>

<TEXT> There will be glass in those portions. I acknowledge your gut reaction of it being 'too busy,' but I like it so, and respectfully disregard it (happens pretty often in design conversation) The figure ground between pattern and wood type is what makes the project, how the pattern is created and infilled using a CNC router is also something not really done before... Ever.

<TEXT> This render is from about 3 weeks ago. The pattern in plan has changed very slightly, and the legs are now less bulky and taper to a square at the bottom. The outline in the pattern is 1/4" walnut plywood and the infill panels are cherry. The legs are walnut and the stringers(beams) between them are cherry. 
    
The panels, infill and pattern, are CNC routed, the connections to the legs are all mortise and tenon.
