<TEXT> Yeah, a bit of a dead giveaway.

But honestly, I know a shit-ton of people that if they received a PM in Linkedin, conversed with the person would most likely not even notice this.  

Not everyone is tech savvy enough to look at the address bar unfortunately. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This was actual PMs within the Linkedin messaging interface.

I reached out to the guy and his linkedin account had indeed been compromised.

Just a heads-up that it isn't just automated phishing scams nowadays.  Good ol' fashion manual manipulation is at play here too. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Something fishy going on with Linkedin messages? </TITLE>

<TEXT> So I got a PM on Linkedin from someone in my network.  It was worded just like some of the GoogleDoc exploits that went around a week or so ago.  

So I PM'ed the guy back and said "this smells fishy were you hacked?" and low an behold I got a response from him telling me "no, the link is good".  So I clicked it and it brings up a clear ripoff/phishing page.

Has anyone run into this?  The actual response from the contact threw me.  Did they maybe hack his Linkedin account and are manually sending these to his contact list or is there something more sophisticated going on here.

When I help people or do giveaways here I always check the requester's comment history.  No history or jerky history, no help.

I think my sin here was allowing myself to become emotionally invested in the young man and further to do anything in the physical world now just repulses me.  It is so much easier to not get involved emotionally when it's words on a screen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I had already had several conversations with the sheriff when we first started helping the boy so that if anything came up with him the sheriff knew to call me so I could help try to resolve it.

I called him and told him that the boy wasn't working for me or being mentored by me any longer.  I didn't see fit to get the kid in any more trouble.  

I did take my license plate and also withheld his last paycheck until he returned by chainsaw and other tools.

When I called the sheriff he said it right - No good deed goes unpunished. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I like helping others here but now I could really just use some advice and a "buck-up" </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-08 20:02:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi there.

I have frequented this sub for a while and enjoy helping out those that just need a little financial help, a laptop, or just something to make their life a little easier.

But I really could use some advice from the other "givers" here.

I've been very successful in life and, as my father taught me, I have always wanted to give back - or "pay it forward".  

That said, my job has caused me to emotionally detach from direct involvement with helping people.  I find it easier and less emotional to just help people without ever really getting to know them.  That way I have no expectations of whether they are or aren't a good person and whether or not I am being "scammed".  You just help someone and move on.

Well, I recently broke my golden rule and I'm paying for it emotionally.  My wife and I met a young man that had gotten himself into some legal troubles.  My gut said he was a good kid that just had been dealt a tough hand.  He was living with his girlfriend and their 4yo son in a shoddy trailer getting by on $200/wk.  He was too proud to take welfare and I respected that.

I hired him to work around our place doing yard and barn chores during the week and working with me on the weekend - so that I could have an extra pair of hands but more importantly so that I could teach him some handyman skills and maybe act as a good role model for him (he never had a father figure other than the one that tied him up and beat him as a kid).  

Everyone this kid knows has ended up in prison.  My wife and I got him a lawyer (we paid for it but had him pay it back through weekly deductions from his checks.  As a result he is out of direct danger but is on probation for the next year.  Any mess ups and he is going to jail for a couple of years.

So over the past 8 months we have gotten to know this kid.  It has been a challenge just trying to get through his young, know-it-all head - but we felt like we were making progress.

There were a few times that I caught him in lies - nothing serious but I made it clear to him that a man keeps his word and never lies.  And in the case where in the heat of the moment, out of fear, you lie - well you need to quickly correct that and, as my father drilled into us, "Accept the consequence of your actions".

Over the past holidays we gave him our old truck that was in superb condition.  We had a new one and didn't need it.  He had an unreliable car and with just one half-running car is fiance could not get a job.

Anyway, last weekend we found out that he had lied about getting the truck registration changed to his name.  He had shown me the "new plates" he got several months ago and I hadn't thought about it since.  Then my wife saw my old plates on the truck and took a picture.  I guess he realized he forgot to swap the plates before he came to work.  A few minutes later when I went to confront him the truck had different plates on it.  Rather than fess up he stuck to his lie and suddenly I realized that he wasn't just lying he was trying to continue with the deception.

I felt like I had no choice but to fire him.  Stupid me expected him to apologize and try to make it right but he went an entire different direction.  He left and began sending nasty, threatening text messages.  Then I realized that he had stolen several of my tools including a chainsaw.

Long story short - he just totally destroyed the relationship and in the process has made my wife and I question why we even put ourselves out there like that.  

The money we provided to help them is irrelevant to us.  The fact that people can be someone so different than what they portray has just shattered our confidence (again) in why we even try.

Have any of you had situations where the emotional damage of real-live relationships in assisting people caused you to take stock of why you help?

Have you found that just helping virtually protects your sanity and emotional well being?

This kid just has me in a really bad place.  I find myself still worrying about what will happen to his little boy but I also realize that we did everything we could... </TEXT>

<TEXT> You know I, as I'm sure you have, searched the internet high and low for my symptoms and possible causes.

I removed as many as I could - stress (stepping aside from my job), caffeine.  But never did I run across anything that indicated that magnesium was something I should look at.

Heck, back when the hand clinching started I of course started taking potassium - because that's what everyone always says causes cramping.

Anyway, I really will be thinking of you.  I hope things go well for you.  

My best advice (even though I couldn't follow it) is just try to keep positive.  

I did an amazing amount of soul searching and estate planning.  That's about the only positive I have from the experience so far.  And until the doctors clear me 100% in three months I'll probably always keep a bit of concern going in the back of my mind. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I see where you are coming from on the first part.  I questioned the same things.  It didn't feel like he started out as someone with extensive experience as "a warrior".  That felt odd. 

I think I got over these concerns as the show moved forward but granted - it was a weird start.

As for the brutality, I didn't think it was nearly as brutal as say DD is.  

Thanks for your thoughts. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Okay. I finally finished Iron Fist last night. Why has there been so much hate on this show? [US] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-05 16:46:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm a 53yo comic nerd but I can't say I ever read an Iron Fist comic or had any special interest in the character. I'm sure I read a few of is appearances in other comics over the years but that's about it.

I went into this show with no preconceived notions other than lowered expectations from reading various online reviews that said it was the worst Marvel show on Netflix.

Was the show perfect? Far from it. But overall it was a pretty good series I thought. Finn Jones had the right physical look. I liked how they had little nods to the Iron Fist costume but didn't go there (yet). I liked some of the easter eggs and tie-ins to the other Defenders. I thought the fights got better as the series went along - not nearly as well choreographed as DD, but reasonable.

My biggest complaints would be that some of the acting was a little weak/hammy (Looking at you Harold!). The Hand was really "downgraded" I thought and portrayed as nothing more than junior martial arts students. That can be explained away though simply as they are being recruited as the local "soldiers" - not the real Ninja warriors that The Hand are.

I also had a problem with Danny's seeming lack of ability to control his emotions. After 15 years of becoming a living weapon - a warrior - he sure seemed to break down in tears a lot and/or lose his temper. But again, I excused this by the end of the series as character development. He left before he learned how to truly be the Iron Fist. He has the power but has yet to learn how to harness it and his emotions. So as a first tale of Danny coming into his own I thought it worked well.

If you hated the show I would really like to hear what specifically about the show you felt didn't work and rates it as the worst of the Marvel shows on Netflix.

Thanks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for checking up on me.  I really appreciate it.

While this response will probably never be viewed by anyone but you I feel it's worth leaving here in case someone in my same situation happens upon it.  Maybe it will give them some encouragement and ideas on how to move forward.

So, in brief the answer is yes -- sort of.  The jury is out but it feels like we have the cause.

So first, after I posted this original query things got much worse - in symptoms, potential diagnosis, and most importantly mentally.

My symptoms progressed and expanded.  My right eye began "pulsing" and twitching.  I began having back spasms that became so painful I was barely getting a few hours of sleep a night.

My weight plummeted to 152.  I am a very muscular "stocky" guy.  I haven't seen 152 since my mid-20's.  My strength just evaporated.

Then the migraines started.  My god.  I have never had a migraine.  It was just crushing.  When one would hit I would simply want to die.  It would generally end in pain so bad that I would start vomiting.  My migraines increased to where I was having them literally daily.

I began having episodes of what could best be described as "panic attacks".  I would just randomly start crying wildly.  Now the logic in my brain said "why are you crying?" but I couldn't stop.  My wife wrote it off to me having a mortality crisis or just the fear of the unknown.  But I can tell you that wasn't it.  It was just something in side of me would suddenly feel like every emotion at once was crushing in on me.

After MRIs and cat-scans at the neurologist I was seeing they ruled out the first wave of things - brain tumor, MS, and a few others.  They told me that I needed to be referred to the Emory Institute for Brain Disease, specifically to a specialist in "degenerative neuro-muscular disease".  Now just the name alone scared the shit out of me - and only made my anxiety worse.

Then the wait.  The neurologist at Emory that I was referred to is well known and respected.  My appointment was set 2 months away.  So, yeah... the wait.  

I had to stop driving entirely.  I am the CEO of a large software company.  I couldn't travel anymore which was a big part of my job.  So I went to my board and asked to step down.  They were very understanding but wouldn't let me do that.  We just shifted some duties until we could know more.  And we elevated the president to Co-CEO allowing me to just focus on internal business and work from home.

I finally got in to see him.  They scheduled a variety of additional tests.  He said he had some "suspicions" but didn't want to say anything until after he reviewed the test results.  These included a different type of MRI, some that I can't remember the names of, and a nerve conduction test.

They put me on sumatriptan, nortriptyline, and an anti-nausea drug.  These seemed to help.  My migraines slowed to one every 2-3 days.  My tremors reduced substantially.  Smaller and the violent leg kicks stopped almost entirely.

On my return visit I got the good news that my tests were clean for the things he was leaning toward.  So he prescribed one more thing.  Magnesium.  MAGNESIUM.

Now if you are like me, I've never thought once about magnesium as it relates to human health.  Google it and you will be surprised. 
 Right there were all of my symptoms listed associated with magnesium deficiency.  It is available over the counter so I bought it and started taking it.  And almost immediately my migraines stopped.  My tremors, that were already light, stopped all together.  My back tremors, hand tremors, leg kicks, eye twitches, and hand cramps - everything!

I'm sleeping again.  My weight is back up to 170.  I'm still weak but getting stronger by the day.

So I guess the moral of the story is the medical profession is really an art more than a science.  We as laymen just assume that the day we get sick a doctor will know what is wrong and cure us.  The months of waiting and guessing become the worst aspect.

And in the end, after you fear the worst, and prepare for the worst - it might just be something as simple as magnesium.  FUCKING MAGNESIUM! </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I went to college, like many students, I had no idea what I wanted to do for a career.

I was on probation after the first year with a 1.75GPA.

I got that pulled up to a 2.5 by the end of my junior year.

I finally had to apply myself senior year and got straight A's in closing out a BA in Economics and then proceed to take one more semester and summer classes in programming.

I graduated with a 2.8 or so but on my resume I showed "Cumulative GPA: 2.8" and "Senior Year GPA: 3.7" and highlighted in interviews that this demonstrated that I had grown up.

Seemed to have worked.  I got a job with a F500 in the IT department.

Today, I'm 53 and CEO of the third software company that I have founded.  I've also been President of one public company and Division CEO of another.

Morale of the story is don't let your unfocused "party years" hold you back.  Tell the story the way you want people to understand it. </TEXT>

I can understand some of the "triggering" talk because it is a very disturbing and haunting show.  But what no one is saying is the important part.

Teenagers, who by definition are in a very awkward and emotional phase of life, SHOULD NOT WATCH THIS SHOW ALONE.  Where are the parents?

We found the show opened great lines of conversation with our son.  If it is used as a family learning and discussion tool it is wonderful.

But as a troubled teenager, watching this show alone, I could see where this would not result in anything good.  </TEXT>

Everyone wants something from you.  Everyone has a motive.

If you make your money a bit later in life you already have your friends and so basically you just shut down that part of your life and don't attempt to make new friends.

I feel sorry for those that get rich young before they realize how crappy most people are. </TEXT>

I won't be installing them until Nov/Dec so they will have about 6 months to dry.

Of course if I screw up (which is highly likely) and the pine logs fail to stay straight I'll be cutting some more and trying to get them somewhat dry before winter. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The roof is closed - the model had a removable ceiling so you could see inside.

I'm going to stop calling it a hobbit house (even though that is my wife's pet name for it) and call it a "beaver lodge" because that is the feeling I'm going for.  It will be lots and lots of wood.

The front will have a hobbit door but that's about it.

The house is underground only to the roof - so the walls are underground.  The roof has a main beam and two "ribs" off of that - so six triangle roof sections in total. 

My plan is once I get the superstructure in place I will attach purlins across between each beam/rib to the next.

I'm hoping to go with solar shingles but if they aren't available commercially by the time I need them I'll probably shift gears and just finish the roof in tin first and then cover it with regular solar panels.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Supposedly (note - supposedly) depending on internal stressors in the log once cut it can bow.

Now I'm not really buying it.  It seems that any bowing of board lumber - sure - that makes sense.  When it was milled the internal structure of the rings are compromised and you would expect you might get bowing, cupping, etc.

But a tree that is growing straight on level land it would seem there would not be any internal stress built up in the tree.  Leaving the internal structure untouched it doesn't make sense to me that the tree would "warp".

Good news is - I'm open for learning.  So if the ones I've cut start bowing during the drying process I'll just rethink things, cuts some more, and try again.

Re: debarking - how do you go about this?  I bought a curved draw shave (I think that's what it's called).  I also bought a curved hand planer.  I was leaning against debarking assuming it will all fall off as the tree dries.  I know it does that with pine.  Do you know if oak bark will fall off in the drying process as well? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cinderblock makes a ton of sense.  

My only concern is that I heard you need to turn them ever week or so.  To do that if I have them on another log perpendicular I should be able to role them pretty easy.  Do you rotate yours or was I mislead on that been a requirement?

As for the splitting I assume you are using your logs for milling.  In my case I cut the logs 5-10' longer than needed and I will be cutting them to size so some cracking on the ends would be fine I think. </TEXT>

I know with Pine does but haven't done Oak before.

What is the purpose of the wax?

I do know that I need to get them elevated off the ground.  I am planning to use some other crappy logs that I have cut with a 2x6 of yellow wood between the two.  I heard that would discourage pests from traveling up to the good log.

<TEXT> This weekend was for finding and cutting the trees that will be the main beam and ribs of the superstructure.

Oh, and I *really* need to stop calling this a hobbit house before I get too far along or people are going to be disappointed when it isn't a true earthen hobbit house.  Beaver Lodge just feels more accurate for what I'm envisioning.

http://imgur.com/a/kXOQm

So after looking at the pictures anyone with advice or experience drying large logs please chime in.   

I'm assuming since they were straight standing and grown on flat land - they should not bow during drying since they will not have their internal structure compromised.  Can anyone confirm that for me? </TEXT>

<TEXT> side by side.  One on each side of the spine.

I'm fused from C2-T1 so I get stiff in the upper back between the shoulderblades.  And of course I have the lower back problems everyone gets as they get older.

So I start by laying down on the floor with a pillow under my head.  I put one ball in each hand and "insert" them about even with my shoulder blades - one on each side.

Start them rolling slowly down your spine by pushing with your feet.  Then when you find a spot that needs some more attention you can rock back and forth with your feet to work the spot.

When you get to your buttocks you can simply grab the balls and put them back at the starting point and repeat.

I usually go down my spine two or three times and then I put the balls on each hip - not the small of the back - but down on the top of the buttocks right below the hip bone.  This is where the sciatic nerve runs.  Just resting on it there relieves the pain and I get ongoing relief for the rest of the night generally.

Hope that helps. </TEXT>

What I am building here is not for everyone.  I love DIY projects and over time when you build things they require maintenance.

Right now while I am still relatively young (53) and have my health I enjoy the building part.

Once everything is built out I'll enjoy the "maintenance mode" when I can't do as much physically.  

That said, I am currently building large stables for my wife and once those are done we are going to start searching for a live-in barn manager and groundskeeper that can help me with ongoing maintenance around the farm. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's happened to me twice now.

In 2010 I took my oldest son (16 at the time) Washington for the Stewart/Cobert  Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear.  Everyone was encouraged to dress up and make funny signs.  We painted ourselves blue with pond dye and went as Na'vi from Avatar with messages on our shirts.

A couple of years ago someone posted a link to a slideshow from that rally.  I was going through the slideshow remembering a lot of the crowd shots when what shows up - but a picture of my son and me.  Was so random it made me laugh.

The other is more recent.  I was asked to do the spokesman part for a web commercial that our company did.  I knew it would be used in email campaigns but didn't expect it to be used in Google Ads.  

One day I was reading an article about SpaceX and about halfway through the article my ugly mug showed up on the page.  At first I was confused.  Then just horrified.  Eventually I started seeing the damn thing just about everywhere. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not planning to mill the timbers at all, hence my question.

I will cut the best straight pines I can locate and then elevate them as they dry.  The bark will be removed (or will fall off) as the log dries but I will not do any milling of the logs.

The logs are all growing on flat land.

So with that information, do you believe they will stay straight?

I'm thinking I will just cut more than needed just in case there is some bowing that occurs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am building a "hobbit house" and planning to harvest pine logs from my property for the super structure beams.  Some will be as long as 45'

If I cut trees that are straight while standing and lay them out elevated from the ground for drying will the log stay straight or will it bow as it dries?

I've always assumed the twisting and bowing of dimensional lumber comes from the fact that the log was milled breaking the internal structure of the timber that holds it straight.

Anyone know or have an opinion? </TEXT>

I do plan to put ventilation in the hidden room.  My thought is that I will bury 2 4" PVC pipes and have them surface just inside the tree line.  I would put an inline fan on one as the inflow.

So given the whole house is really one large room with a loft it sounds like having windows in the loft that open as well as the front door should suffice.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks.  I live in the south so no freeze to worry about.

So for the front facing logs that will be exposed to the elements (north facing) is there a preferred way to protect the wood against pests?

I intend to pour a heavy footer with a metal bracket at the base of every log to bolt to.  There should be no direct contact with earth - just wood to concrete.

So if I cut these from my property do I need to do any type of curing on the wood?  Since I will not be cutting them in anyway (just removing the bark) my understanding is that since the grain is not compromised as it would be when milled that the log should maintain it's form - i.e. if the tree is straight while standing the log will remain straight when cut.  Is that correct? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi there.  I'm in the early stages of building a "hobbit house".  I hesitate to call it that as it is not a classic "earthen" hobbit house but that's what my wife calls it so I'll go with it for now (I prefer Beaver Lodge).

Anyway, I have done the general excavation and will be putting up a /r/DIYinprogress album for feedback as I go.

But first, I need a little guidance on the logs that I will be using for the main superstructure.  

I built a 1/12 scale model.  Here's a pic: http://imgur.com/a/kXOQm

The main beam is the largest - 18-24" - 45' long.  The next two ribs on each side need to be 40' and a bit smaller diameter.   The front two (that support the main beam) and the cross beam between those two needs to be 12-16" - 30' long.  So 7 logs total.

I have straight pine on my property that I can use.  I'm just wondering about the longevity of using pine for the superstructure.  Thoughts?

I am considering using oak logs but I would have to buy those and have them shipped.  Any idea what cut unfinished logs like that run?

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> LOVE IT!  It can't come fast enough.

I just posted a month ago on here that my last movie attended in a theatre would be the 2/3rds of Logan that I got to see before leaving because of the crappy people behind me with little kids, on their phones, and ignoring my pleas to please be quiet.

Although I LOVE Marvel movies I've just committed to myself that I will wait to see them when they come out on VOD. But I would have happily paid to $50 to see Logan (to the end) at home in peace and quiet.

They don't mention it in the article - but the accepted (bad) behavior of patrons is a big reason that people don't want to go to movies any more. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really just looked at the wild grove next door - liked the height - seems to top out at about 15-20'.  

I am on a large horse farm and this is planted on the back side of a hill that I've put a viewing patio on top of.  180 degrees where I planted the bamboo backs up to one of our hay fields that is cut 3-4 times a year so just like at my neighbors I expect that side to be controlled from the cutting.

On top of the hill is where I'm guessing I will have my work - if it starts coming over the top of the hill it could undermine the patio I've put up there.

But I really like the idea of a bamboo "curtain" on the hill and don't mind the ongoing maintenance really.  Just a lot of people REALLY hating on Bamboo has me a bit concerned. </TEXT>

The reason I am asking is that I took some cuttings and planted them around one side of a 20' raised hill that I have - http://imgur.com/cgEYrZM

When I posted my project on /r/diy everyone was freaking out and telling me to rip it out immediately.

I realize it can be invasive an you have to manage it but I there were so many comments against bamboo I thought I should come here and see if I could get a little more information. </TEXT>

So I build something.  Learn something.  Adapt it if possible or tear it apart and try for something better.

Sounds like you have built quite the system there.  Got any pics?

Thanks again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow!  Thanks.  Quite the setup you have.

First - I don't know the head pressure (sounds NSFW to me :P).  Seriously I did look at it when I was determining the right pump but I don't recall because I didn't really understand it - I just looked on the chart that told me which one.  My plan has been to add additional inline pumps once everything has been running for a while.

On the biofilter I think you are talking about something I have on my 300 gallon aquarium.  Basically they are called "bioballs" and you buy them by the mesh sack.  Each sack is filled with little plastic balls with something inside (seeder bacteria maybe?).  Anyway sounds like what you are suggesting is adding an upsized version of that.  Would you put it down at the cistern (inflow) end or just in front of where the water comes out of the waterfall?

Cattails I am definitely not getting rid of.  They are something I have always wanted and I'll fight whatever battles I need for them.

The bamboo was an after thought.  I am trying to find out what type of bamboo it is - running or clumping - before I decide if I need to pull it.  Normally one or two wackos telling me that something will kill me I can ignore.  But there was quite the cacophony of "KILL BAMBOO!!!!" going on in this thread that has me worried.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just made it up.  I knew I needed an enclosed clear space for the pump and I wanted several layers of filter in front of that.

I just picked up a used 330 gallon plastic cistern.  They are used frequently on farms and people are always trying to get ride of them.

I cut a whole in the top with a sawzall.  Built a basket out of 2x2s and enclosed it (except for the top) with bonded wire.

Just fill the basket with barley hay, add the microfiber aquatic filter and you are good to go. </TEXT>

<TEXT> LOL!  My only advice - don't become a CEO.  Anyone that ever tells me they want to become a CEO on day I have concluded is saying that just because of the money they have heard is involved.

No one in their right mind would WANT to be a CEO.  I have been CEO at multiple companies, private and public, and have hated every moment of it.  But when you found the companies you end up in the corner office most of the time whether you like it or not.

I'm fortunate enough to have a great president that we are promoting to CEO and that is letting me slip into the background and do what I love to do - design software.  But even that will only be for a few more years at most. 

Then I can focus full time on building crazy things. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well first - permits if you need them.  We don't where we live but check with your DOR.  

It would be easiest, cheapest, and best to put your pond where you have either a small creek or spring.  That wasn't an option for where I wanted to place this thus the additional expense for the deep well.

Advice for getting started?  Get started.  The problem everyone has is they "dream" about what they want to do and then keep delaying by "planning" for every as a way to procrastinate.

You want a pond, start digging.  Figure it out as you go.  At least that's my motto. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't say it's better.  I've mixed enough wet mortar in my days.  I didn't like the idea of mixing it and moving every stone to mortar it in.

So I tried this method and it worked really well.  Remember this isn't like mortaring brick.  The only objective was to get the stones "set" so they don't move when you push up against them while swimming.

Saved me a ton a time and seems to have accomplished the objective. </TEXT>

We helped a young man that was going down the wrong path in life get straight and I had high hopes he would reach up and snatch the opportunity but I can see he isn't going to be reliable long-term.

The problem is finding someone that a) loves manual labor b) loves working outdoors c) loves learning new things and trying new things d) is loyal and reliable.

Once I have the caretaker cabin built - it will be a cute 1,200 sq ft 2 bed / 2 bath house - I'll start seriously looking for and vetting people until I can find someone that wants to help take care of this place with me and ultimately can manage it when my wife and I are off on other adventures. </TEXT>

I do think I almost pushed her over the edge with my lake house build that I did by offering to barter a camper we had in exchange for construction labor and I found two guys from MI on craigslist and invited them to drive down, live in the trailer on the property while we built it, and then take the trailer when they left.

With this pond my maintenance is basically once ever week or so I pull the microfilter and hose it off.  Weeding the sand beach is probably the most ongoing labor but I enjoy that at night.  I find it therapeutic to walk around in my bare feet pulling up little straggler grass.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh my.  That was the worst DIY abortion I have ever done.

First, I bought 4'x8' sheets of plexiglass mirrors that I found on Craigslist.  They come with a protective covering that you remove after installation.

So I build the damn thing, hung the mirrors, and then removed the coating - only to find that they a) are not clear like a glass mirror - more cloudy, less crisp but more importantly b) ANY slight variation in the underlying plywood transfers to the mirror so you end up with a funhouse effect.  

It was horrible.  I enjoyed the day I tore that back down. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can get the liner in any size you want custom. I just searched craigslist and found a place in FL.  Ordered it and they delivered to my door (well, yard).

I did consider not using a liner.  I did a seep test since we have deep red GA clay.  But ultimately I decided to spend the money to minimize the seep that I would have to deal with.

I would always prefer to have a ground spring or creek run-in but that just wasn't in the cards for where I wanted to build this.

Bobcat - yes I have an LS170 New Holland.  I bought it used on craigslist.  Best investment I've ever made.  You should be able to rent one for a weekend for about $200.

Protip here - find a rental place closed on Sunday.  They will generally rent you the equipment for the full weekend for a one day rental rate.  If they don't advertise it, just ask.  Equipment sitting in the yard isn't making them any money. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When our older kids left for college we said we were getting the hell out of the Atlanta area.  We searched FL, TN, SC, and AL.

In the end, we stumbled across this place and fell in love with the land.  It had been in the same family since before the Civil War (there is actually a small cemetery on the grounds).

It has been everything we dreamed of having. </TEXT>

The water hyacinth is locally available - even if it is "invasive" in that it grows really fast.

I think the one people have been pointing out is the one I brought back from FL to GA. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1) I have put in a deep-well - 425 feet.  Not only does this service the pond but provided a secondary well to service the house in case we ever have an issue with the primary well.

2) First, do the excavation yourself.  Now that I tried and (and liked it!) I rent an excavator every few months when I have thought of enough uses for the weekend).  I would *not* have tried the pumping design without finding a human to talk to or email with.  I just didn't understand some basics and didn't get any hints from the online sources I used.  Had I had a /r/DIYdiaries to consult with and get advice I might have skipped a lot of $$ and headaches. </TEXT>

I had it in my last farm pond and while it grows *like crazy* it is an amazing active filter. </TEXT>

I started out looking to build a traditional "hobbit house".  The more I have gotten into it I've taken to calling it a "beaver lodge".

It is underground - cut into the side of a hill overlooking our active beaver pond.   But it won't have an earthen roof.  

I'm actually planning to do a Tesla powerwall and *hopefully* (if availability/timing works) go with Tesla solar shingles on the south facing side so it can be off grid. </TEXT>

At our last property I did my first farm pond which was "meh" and a little koi pond.  That's what this is most like - just kind of supersized.

Really the key to clear water is just keeping it active and ensuring there is no "run-in" where dirt can make it back into the water.

And realize that at different times of the year it will be clearer than others. </TEXT>

- 70 tons sand ($100/ton) = 7k
- 65 tons rocks ($100/ton) = 6.5k
- Deep well drilled and pump installed = 5k
- Pond Liner = 4k
- Initial Excavation = 2.8k
- Equipment rentals = 1.2k
- Pump and PVC = 2k
- Mortar, Landscaping, misc = 2-3k </TEXT>

<TEXT> As the title says, about 30k total - spread over 3 years.

The cost is all in the natural materials so if you have access to cheap river rocks and sand you could probably knock 15k off of that.  

The only other major costs are the pump (1k), the liner (4k), and the deep-well (5k). </TEXT>

There are many frogs, toads, and lizards that call the pond home.

Additionally there isn't stagnant water as it is always circulating (the same reason you don't breed mosquitos in an active swimming pool). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Already stocked with fish.  Too many frogs to mention (wonderfully loud on a summer night).  We really have had no mosquito issues.

As for the algae - I use barley hay in the one of the filters which is a natural algae-cide.  I also have grass carp in the pond which as they mature should keep any troublesome aquatic growth under control.

Thanks for the feedback. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of the great things about not living in a city or the suburbs anymore.

We have no permitting at all out here. 

We are actually in the process of building 4 additional "staycation" homes on the property - a house on our lake, a hobbit house overlooking our beaver pond, a "tree house" that overlooks a natural waterfall with rocks as large as semis, and a caretaker cabin.  Also mid-build on new stables (that old white barn was just a fixer-upper until I could build what my wife really wanted).

The plan is to market to the Atlanta area as a weekend getaway - bring your horses (six miles of trails!) and fishing pole.  Pick one of the unique house you want to stay in and enjoy your stay.

We'll see how that works out. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> See, that's the problem right there.

People are happy to spend 30k on an inground pool and finance it into their mortgage.  They'll do that in a minute.

But this effectively cost me less than $1,000 a month over three years.  Sure it was usually in larger slugs but when I had some free cash flow I would buy a load or two of stones and have another month or so of work.  

In our "McDonald's Era" of immediate gratification people just aren't willing to wait 3 years to have something.

I've found that the journey to build something is just as (and sometimes more) gratifying as enjoying the end result. </TEXT>

I usually cast net some small fry to bring up.  The bass get most of them but a few survive.  

Over time I can easily cull if I get some breeders and I move those back down to the large lake. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Live in the country on several hundred acres.  

For a long time I kept "waiting" thinking I wanted to buy a large tractor combo with all the implements.  

If finally broke down and figured why not get a skid steer first because much of what I need to do it could handle and I already have a neighbor that will bushhog for me.

So I started watching Craigslist and very quickly found a perfect fit - a New Holland LS170.  I bought it from a guy that owns a landscaping company.  It was used mostly on site to do a little grading and then to fork in the pallets of stone needed for the job.  The skidsteer only had about 700 hours on it.

I got the skidsteer plus the a transport trailer for $12,000 which was WAY less than I was expecting to pay.  I absolutely love it.  Small, doesn't take up much space - but literally does everything I need it to do.

I don't know your exact situation but I can't say enough great things about having a skidsteer.  It's saved my back a million times and I'm always inventing new ways to use it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes it pretty much maintains itself.

The only thing I really do is in the cistern that houses the pump I have a large cage made out of bonded wire that I keep filled with barley hay which is a nature algae-cide.  In front of there are thick microfiber filters.  About one every couple weeks I pull the one filter out and replace it with the spare then hose off the dirty one and it's ready to go the next time need to swap them.

I have a third filtration layer between the swim pond and the natural pond comprised of several tons of pea gravel.  This is actual the first filtration encountered by the water and allows collection of any larger sediment such as leaves, twigs, etc.  Very easy to remove from that area by hand or with a rake. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No.  I have drilled a deep well because we wanted a second one on the property anyway. 

With the two waterfalls what happens is the swim end always stays at the same water level but the natural pond end can be raised and lowered for different effects.  I have a bed of pea gravel between the two and if I lower the water level then I get an active stream that runs between the two.  If I raise it then I have a little shallow area that the minnows like to hang out in to avoid the bass.

On the far end of the natural pond section I have buried a 330 gallon cistern and the pump is inside that.  So as the water flows down over the waterfalls into the natural end it continues to feed the cistern which in turn pumps the water at 18,000 gallons per hour back to the top of the waterfall via a buried 3" PVC line. </TEXT>

So I have a bilge tank that is 30 gallons behind the wall which is in the closet of our master bedroom.  I plumbed a water line to it so when I need to add water I just turn on the faucet and add water in the bilge tank up to a line marked on it.  Makes it so easy to maintain.  The tank also has my filters and bio-balls in there and then the pump sends water back up in the aquarium.  Really low maintenance.  

One of these days I plan to add a ballcock float so like a toilet so that it will add water itself when needed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My god the comments here are doom and gloom.

First, question - is the pond spring or creek fed?  Or is it a seasonal pond?  With a spring or creek fed you don't really have much to worry about - including the guy warning you about cottonmouth and snapping turtles.  Take it from a guy that pretty much lives in our small lake - and yes swims (and catches) the snakes and snapping turtles.  They will not attack you and frankly you rarely see them because they will head the opposite direction from you as soon as they see you.

As a side note, I also have built a 100,000 gallon natural swim pond in my yard that has fish in the natural end and a large waterfall feeding into the swim end.  It is fed from a deep well and circulates via high-volume submersible pump through three levels of natural and artificial filter systems.  

I still haven't put up a DIY project on this but will once the landscaping fully comes in this spring.  Three years into this build so far: http://imgur.com/a/zhfyv

EDIT:  A couple more pics as I realized from that angle (above the waterfall) you couldn't really see the full pond.  http://imgur.com/a/soSPI </TEXT>

Nearly the same - 1967 built.  Rehabbing and expanding.

I initially put in bat insulation and just like you - it was a waste.  Even with strapping the insulation sags between the straps.

I had foam insulation put in the walls and roof when I put in the addition and wish I had done the same with the floor.

I also just had foam put in a new outbuilding with my office and workshop.

Having it done twice now I am considering having them come back and do the crawl space to solve things once and for all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One morning we were driving down a busy road near our house when a small movement near a privacy fence caught my eye.

The privacy fence ran along the perimeter of a housing development.  I turned the car around in the entrance and went back to look.  We found an injured dog laying up against the fence.  it had obviously been hit by a car and pulled itself 30-40 feet to the fence.  There was no collar on the dog.

I wrapped the dog in my coat and carried it to the car.  While I was putting it in the back seat with the kids my wife called to me that she had found something.  It was a dog collar laying by the side of the road.  There was no ID but there was a rabies tag from Texas.

We took the dog to the vet and while they were working on it I searched around on the web to find out how to track down a rabies tag.  I can't recall what department I ended up getting but they were able to give me the number of the vet's office that had issued the tag.

I called the number and got the vet.  I explained what had happened and described the dog.  The vet immediately knew who's dog it was and said that the owner had just moved to the Atlanta area where we lived. 

He got in touch with the owner and had them call me.  It turned out that they lived in the housing development that the privacy fence was around.  Apparently the dog had gotten out of their yard and found it's way out to the road.  

It ended happy enough.  The dog lived and the lady made chocolate chip cookies for my kids.

<TEXT> Great question. Hopefully I'll have an answer for you soon. 

I am currently building a cabin on our lake. We like this floor so much we are thinking we're going to do the same thing in the great room down there. 

However my wife also feels that it's very cold so I am thinking of doing radiant heating at the cabin which I've been meaning to take a shot at for a while now.  Seems like the perfect time to try it.

<TEXT> So let's see.  First things first, yes you would need to pull up the base boards but those are pretty easy to remove and replace (if you are careful pulling them off).

The crack scares me a bit.  There is obviously stress on the slab at that point and some foundation movement.  My concern would be that the SLC would be very thin and I think any further movement might lead to a crack for you.

But yes, I think it would be nice in a living area.  In fact I am building a cabin on our lake right now and I think we are going to do this same thing there in the great room.  

For the electrical outlets that shouldn't really be an issue.  Just remove the outlet cover and use some cardboard to make a little raise form around the area.  You should be able to use a riser plate cover to bring the outlet up the 1/4" or so.

Some comments have indicated concerns about longevity but I have not experienced anything that leads me to believe that I will have issues.  The Sika is polymer-based and seems extremely resilient not to mention the epoxy finish on top adding quite a bit of protection.  And frankly if I ever did have an issue - so be it - I'll redo the now perfectly leveled floor with tile.    </TEXT>

I didn't see any wicking to the drywall.  It's only about 1/4 inch deep and the drywall is slightly elevated from contact with the base slab.

It sets up fairly fast so wicking shouldn't really be an issue even if there is a lot of contact with the drywall. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let me clarify.  The 1 minute between pours is when I was doing smaller 1-2 gallon pours out of a 5 gallon mix.

When I did the larger room we initially tried using my electric cement mixer but it just didn't do as good of a job mixing it as the mud paddle.

So for the larger room there was more like 5 minutes between each pour.

One other tip - you will get some small "clumps" on occasion in mixture.  This seemed to be where maybe a small amount of moisture had clumped and hardened in the bag before it was even bought.  Anyway, if you have any of these just pick them out and the mix will settle in where it was.  If you have any small area where one pour doesn't self-level fully to the prior one I would just smooth it with my hand to nudge it together.  That would leave some very cool little marks in the finish that add some additional character/marbling to it. </TEXT>

If you are getting moisture in the slab itself I'm not sure how you would handle that but the epoxy finish I think would sure the purpose of "sealing" it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes.  I would mix it in a five gallon bucket.  For the larger area I would dump the full bucket - sometimes walking along creating a "line" that would spread back and touch the prior pour.  Sometimes just dumping in one place that would spread and create a circle.

For smaller area I still mixed it in a 5 gallon bucket but I would transfer it to a smaller 2 gallon bucket or just pour a smaller amount, wait a minute or 2, then pour another small amount (maybe a gallon at a time). </TEXT>

<TEXT> All in $2.50 sq ft.  I think that's pretty reasonable.

Especially given the fact that when I started this project is was really supposed to just be used to get the floor level before finishing it with tile or something.

We ended up liking how it looks so much that we decided just to go ahead and make it the finish floor.

Edit: Oh, and the work compared to other finishes was a breeze.  I'm used to back breaking work putting down tile or hardwoods.  This was literally a standing up job.  Very easy on the back and knees. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I can't give a straightforward answer because of the mistakes I made.

But the office is 450 sq ft.  The bathroom is about 80 sq ft.

The bathroom would be the best way to get to a price since I had figured things out by then.

I used 5 bags of self-leveling concrete at about $22 per bag.  This is the brand I used: http://www.homedepot.com/p/Sika-50-lb-Self-Leveling-Underlayment-517004/207086698  So $110 for concrete.

One box of the garage finish epoxy like this: http://www.homedepot.com/p/Rust-Oleum-EpoxyShield-240-oz-Gray-High-Gloss-2-5-Car-Garage-Floor-Kit-301355/206479008 - This is not the exact one but same maker.  I bought the clear gloss finish.  $90

So total of $200 for 80 sq ft or $2.5 / sq ft is a good target. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just poured.

A couple (hard) lessons learned:

- Use MORE water than the package says.  My first attempt I followed the directions exactly and it was a disaster.  It was too thick and would not "self-level".
- Mix it in small batches using a "mud paddle" bit.  Once I got comfortable with the amount of water I wanted added I used a 5 gallon bucket and marked a water line on it.  I would add the water first and then slowly add the concrete mixing as I went.  
- The THINNER you make it the lighter the floor comes out.  If you make it too thin then you end up with a bit of white coloring (caulk) on the top.  This sweeps off / buffs off very easy.
- The bathroom I am very happy with.  This was the last one I have done.  I really like the dark color which came from finding just the right level of water (a bit thicker than what I did in the office).

EDIT: I forgot one other tip.  How much marbling you want will dictate the bucket size for applying it.  The large office I used full 5 gallon buckets.  Just pour it out in an non uniform design - sometimes go in long flowing swoops.  other times more of a large puddle/circle.  When doing smaller areas like the bathroom I used a small 2 gallon bucket so that there was more marbling. </TEXT>

The purpose of this post I hope is that somewhere somebody starts to see this frequent situation before theatres become the same as drive-ins - a blast-from-the-past oddity that people go to once or twice in their lives to say they did it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow.  Not quite the response I expected but everyone is entitled to their opinion.

All I know is that for decades management seemed to control the theatres just fine.  There were active ushers standing in the front at different times to deal with people that were talking or clowning around.  So theatres can deal with it if they wanted to.  There were 7 employees sitting in the lobby at a table laughing and having a good time.  So clearly it wasn't a priority to management to ensure the patrons were following the rules.

Anyway, you won't have to worry about the old guy with his family just sitting there quietly anymore.  With the old fuddy-duddy gone you will be able to have an enjoyable MST3k experience.

I hope you have fun arranging your day to go to showings that are "less frequented".  Most people don't have that luxury. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Theatre owners,

Hello old friend.  Wow how we have grown old together.  I'm 52 now but I remember riding my bike to the theatre to see Star Wars.  I grew up with ritual dates every other weekend to see a new movie.

Marriage and kids came next.  While that may have changed the types of movies I went to I still came to see you several times a month.  Luckily I got to raise kids in the Pixar era when the "kids" movies really weren't that bad and had enough fun for adults that it wasn't torture to watch.

Now I have moved into middle-life and with the comic books of my youth now projected up on the big screen I find that I'm the one dragging my kids - who frankly would rather not go to a theatre.

That's right you are losing (or have already lost) the next generation.

Well guess what?  Your inability to control your theatres to provide an enjoyable experience in this age of "me-first", inconsiderate patrons has now cost you one life-long viewer.

I took my wife and youngest son to see Logan this weekend.  Behind us sat a family of 5 - mother and four kids, the youngest about 2 years old.  In an R rated movie.  The rest ranged in age from 8ish to maybe 15.  They constantly talked even after I turned around and asked them several times to please be quiet.  The mother on her phone texting and didn't seem to care one way or the other.

Finally I couldn't handle it any more so I simply left.  The "manager" who looked like he was about 12 offered us "free movie passes" but I told him no thank you.  Maybe the 7 workers sitting at the tables laughing should have been ushering (you know - like the good ol' days?) ensuring that your guests are able to watch the movie they pay for uninterrupted.

So you have lost the next generation to the convenience of digital entertainment at home.

Now you have lost this life-time moviegoer.  $50 for three people to go to a movie where the only thing we can hear is the other people that paid $50 talking and joking around?

Nope.  Thanks.  I'll wait for it to come out on Amazon or Netflix.

And I sure hope the Entertainment Industry starts realizing that theatres are getting ready to go the way of the drive-in and start releasing new movies directly to PPV.  I would have gladly paid $50 to Amazon to watch Logan at home where I would actually have been able to hear the dialog and know how the movie ends.

<TEXT> I'm the CEO of an enterprise SaaS HRIS vendor.  Prior life I have been developer, a consultant in the space and Director of HRIS at a F500.

First question - do you enjoy working with computers?  If not don't even think about a career in HRIS.

Further, what are your interests with regard to HRIS?  You can approach it from a variety of angles ranging from:

- Corporate user.  You learn and use the HRIS that a company has in place.  If it is a legacy on-premise system like PeopleSoft or SAP you will learn one specific system and a client-specific set of processes.  If it is SaaS based you will have less access to the tech but you will be tasked with more "configuration" of the rules to implement your employer's processes.

- Consultant.  Hooking on with one of the many consulting firms in a junior position is always a good starting place if you enjoy fast paced and ever changing environments.  You move from client to client - each with differing HRIS systems and requirements.  You learn a broad range of skills applicable to many facets of corporate life - negotiating deliverables, efficient meeting management, crisis management, etc.  If you have dreams of becoming and executive one day this is a *great* path to go through.

- Vendor side.  Going to the vendor side is as close as you can get to the technology aspects.  It is daunting and painful.  The systems you have a hand in designing are *mission critical* to the customers that buy them - especially if the solution includes payroll.  

I've sat in each of the seats above and can honestly say that everyone is very different and has pros and cons.  The direction you pick is really based on our personal goals and personality.

Best of luck to you!

<TEXT> Honestly it really depends on the employer.

Larger companies are so tied to their processes they can't see the forest through the trees.

My company has no problem promoting people directly based on their skills.

When I started this company I hired a 22yo with a finance degree.  Nothing but intern experience.  He was stellar!  So within 2 years I had him as my Director of Finance managing people twice his age.  He stayed with us for 4 years and was amazing before it was time for him to spread his wings. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not sure of your age but I can share with you my personal story.

I was raised to believe that you work hard and you will be rewarded.  That was from my father's generation when companies were loyal and everyone had a pension.  Jobs were for life.

When I graduated college in 1986 I took my first job with a Fortune 500 company and started doing what my father had taught me.  I worked hard, long hours.  All of the things you mentioned you did.  But when I finally asked about a raise/promotion I was told "you don't have enough grey hair".  

The next time I saw my father I literally cried as I told him that I couldn't play by those rules.  And he gave me the advice that would change my life.  He said "son, times are different.  You still have to work hard and you should give an employer your all but if they don't reciprocate then you have to find the right employer that will".

I left the corporate cubicle world.  I became a consultant getting paid multiples over what I was paid as an employee to do the same job basically.  And as a consultant somehow people would actually listen to me regardless of my hair color.

After a few years, that got old.  Sure the money was great but the travel was killing me (and my first marriage).  For all the money I was making I realized that the firm I worked for was making *way* more off of me.  

When you realize that you are a commodity and profits are simply based on how many hours you can bill it becomes clear that there is a firm cap to the amount of money you can make - i.e. how many hours are you willing to work/bill?

So I quit and started my own software company.  I built and sold that one, founded another one.  Built and sold that one.  Founded another one.  

This third (7 years in) will be my last because now I'm 52 and want to relax a bit and enjoy the fruits of my labor.

Moral of the story is it takes two to tango.  Work hard and if you aren't rewarded move on.

But I have had too many hires in the past couple years of youngsters talking a big game and then when you put them in they are over their head.  Earn your right to sit in a chair people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I moved into my new office!

I have been building it for over a year now.  I still have a little bit of trim work and clean up to do.

Since I started working from home full time about six months ago I have been working in my bed with a laptop on my lap.

I just decided enough is enough.  Start working in your new office and you'll feel like a new man.  

So far, so good. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> A willingness to work hard to earn promotions/raises.

There seems to be a sense of "well, if you pay me more then I will do more".

We were taught to do the job you want not the one you have.  Exceed expectations and show what you can do and the promotions/raises will come behind it.

Today's generation seems to want the pay and title first before proving they really can deliver on what they say they can.

<TEXT> Well that leads to another funny story. When I was younger and a lot stupider I loaded up a lot of hardwood flooring in the bed of my truck and didn't strap it in. When I pulled out at a light the entire load ended up in the middle of the intersection and I had to reload it all with the help of strangers. Pretty humiliating.

So now the pendulum has swung the other way and I am concerned about everything I'm doing when I'm coming home from Home Depot.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> I am positive they are now putting up roadblocks and searching every car in GA. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So Saturday morning I needed to make my Home Depot run at a [5].  I live in rural GA so it's one stop down the interstate about 10 miles.

I bought some 16' lumber, loaded it in my truck and started back home.  I was feeling pretty happy and I always get a bit nervous when I am carrying lumber so I decided I would go on the back roads home rather than take the interstate.

As I came up to the main street stoplight in our little town I thought "man, it's busy today".  Cars were backed up at the light which is very unusual.  I finally got to the front and did a right-on-red when there was a break in the cars going through.

Wow.  I can't get over how busy it is today.  Well, hopefully this will thin out in a minute when we get out of downtown.

But as we get out of town nothing changes.  The road is very winding so I can only see 5 or 6 cars in front of me but the traffic is only moving at about 30 miles per hour.  What the hell?  Must be an accident or something up ahead.

This goes on for several miles until I finally get to a straightaway where I can see up ahead for a mile.  I see just a stead stream of slow moving cars and... what's this... a cop car is about six cars in front of me and he has his lights on.  Oh he must be pulling someone over or going to whatever accident is ahead.

The car line keeps moving.  Slowly.  Now the paranoia sets in.  That cop isn't jumping the line to get to an accident.  What is he doing?  It's almost like he's keeping us in line.  Oh my god!  There must be a roadblock ahead.  Oh shit!  Trump must have issued an executive order to stop all cars and search them!

Now I'm passing a farmer that was working on his fence.  He has stopped working and is watching the parade of cars heading into the greatest roadblock/drug search of all time!  You smug bastard!

Here it comes.  Around the next corner there are two more cop cars blocking the road with their lights on.  They are corralling all of the cars into... into... what?... the Baptist Church parking lot?  Why would they search us there?

Guys, I am so stupid.  It literally took me until I saw the cars directly in front of me get motioned around the cop cars that I realized I was in a frickin' funeral procession.

Holy shit that was an intense trip to Home Depot.

TL;DR - I joined a funeral procession without knowing it and spent 15 minutes thinking I was be herded into a police drug/alcohol search point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The other thing that is hard, especially when posting on reddit with your DIY projects is that it doesn't take much ignorance or lack of detail for "experts" to jump in and tell you what you did wrong.

For instance, I have done extensive research on pouring concrete slabs as I have needed to do several now for an office/garage and horse barn.  

Everyone will tell you that you need to use rebar no matter what.  However I have found (and learned from the farmers around me that have been doing this for a looonnnngggg time) that if you get 5,000 DOT mix with fiber mixed in you don't need rebar.  I have now poured some very large pours like this and have not had one crack.  

It's a case were what was probably "standard practice" years ago or in one area of the country (northern with frost heave) dictates how certain people approach what they HAVE to do with a project.

So again, listen, learn, try.  Go with what you believe is the best approach.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just need to repeat that important warning - you are not going to find a consensus on just about anything so look for the important points and separate those from the "opinion" points and even then know there will always be people that disagree and deride you work (assuming you post your projects here).

Just use your head and have a thick skin.

EDIT:  ALSO don't be afraid to make mistakes.  They happen.  Learn from them and apply the learnings to your next project. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are welcome!

And here's the most IMPORTANT DIY tip I can give you.  If you don't know how to do something look on Youtube.  I can't tell you how many times a YT video has saved my skin.

Sure you might watch 5 videos and all will tell you something different but across the group you will get the jist of the main things you HAVE TO GET RIGHT and the "optional" things that everyone has a personal opinion on.

I rented an excavator a while back and succeeded at throwing a track.  Without Youtube I would have been done for the weekend.  But 5 minutes later I knew what I had to do - it just took me another hour to fix it. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recently finished the floor of my office which had originally been planned to be a garage and so the concrete pour was very rough finish.

I used self-leveling underlayment/concrete and after a few hit-or-miss learning tries I ended up with what looks a bit like marble.  Then I finished it with an epoxy sealer.

Very happy with the results.  I'll be posting a DIY project album on it soon but here's a quick pic: http://imgur.com/a/6zrZb </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nice explanation.  I'll add to it from the tax perspective.

Sole proprietor files the taxes for the business via a Schedule C on their personal taxes.  The business can take deduct legitimate expenses and pay normal salary to the owner (taxed normally - i.e. W2 income).  Any profit of the business is subject to a roughly 15% self-employment tax and then taxed at normal rates on the owner's 1040.

LLC profits are dispersed to all members prorata via a K-1 statement at tax time.

Corps come in two flavors - C and S. S  also pays out profits on K-1 to shareholders.  C corp pays corporate taxes on any profits before dispersing via dividends to shareholders which are then taxed on the dividends.

<TEXT> The short answer is "no" but the longer-answer is I'm still trying to figure it out.

I mean, I was a "forgainst" vote.  I don't really care for Hillary but I voted for her because Trump scares me.

I detest his ego.  His racism.  His misogyny.   His overall flippant and dangerous personality.

But then I've watched what he has done since becoming President-elect.  Almost every announcement I am initially in shock.  But then I think, you know what - maybe he is literally mentally unstable but he plays it with such hubris that people think he is a genius.  Not crazy but maybe crazy like a fox.

Now I'm starting to wonder just how bad could this be?  Maybe a total shitstorm is what American politics needs.  

Republicans for 8 years have predicted Obama's policies would be THE END OF THE WORLD.  Know what?  It hasn't happened.

Maybe the screaming about Trump will turn out to be the same.  Will he cause some damage?  Surely (Obama made some bone-headed mistakes in my opinion - all presidents do).  But will the world end?  Will America become a third world country?  No it will not.  

But maybe the shitshow will be sufficient to wake people up and scare some sense into the politicians. 

The first time the Republican congress goes against Trump and he starts tweeting shit about them the curtain will be dropped and the public will see all of the lies and machinations that are Washington.

Maybe this presidency is exactly what America needs to get up off its fat, crybaby ass and start acting like adults. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am in GA.  Roughly same weather as SC.

I just finished my 500 sq ft stand-alone office using spray foam.  I also used spray foam two years ago in the master BR addition I built onto our main house.

While it was more expensive I am VERY pleased with the results.  When they are done there is not a pinhole where air gets in.

I installed a 14,000 BTU AC/Heat combo unit.  It hardly runs.  The room holds the heat or the cold pretty nicely.

My two cents would be it is worth it if you can afford the additional.

BTW - you can do this yourself.  I do most DIY myself but this one just seemed like something not worth the rental, mess, and learning curve for. </TEXT>

I am building my home office and have one wall that will be a moving partition made up of four 4'x8' panels.

I am looking for a set of panels from an older (70's or before) Cap comic that contains 4 comic panels with the first being Cap throwing throwing his shield and the next three being the shield hitting bad guys - bouncing from one to the next.

I know I've seen panels like this many times over the years but short of going through every old Cap comic I have I was hoping someone here might be able to point to some issues where this was shown. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay.  Just trying to narrow down where you are on this.

So if someone is actively accepting money from the government they shouldn't be able to vote, correct?

You said "welfare".  I assume you mean just poverty related social programs like SNAP or WIC?  What about Medicaid?  How about Medicare?  That is used by retirees who are not contributing to the economy.  Should retirees be able to vote?  

Back to my suggestion.  If you really want to only reward certain citizens with right to vote (setting aside the Constitutional issues that raises) shouldn't you reward those that are contributing the most by letting them have the most votes?  Why should the hamburger flipping "socialist" get as many votes as I do.  I'm a "job creator".  I make a lot of money.  I should get a bigger say in things.

If you think I am being sarcastic, you are right.  If you simply follow this logic to its conclusion the dreaded 1% (of which I am part) will control all aspects of society and will determine how you lowly peasants of the 99% live.

Be careful when you start alienating groups that you look down on because there will always be a different group looking down on you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, I don't.  

I agree with you that both candidates knew the rules of the game as it is currently played and someone won fair and square.  I have no issues with that.

I just think that everything else in America has evolved over 240 years.  Our laws are always changing to reflect the reality of our changing world.  Why should this be sacrosanct?

I appreciate that Clinton has refrained from being a sore loser.  I appreciate that she quickly conceded and has fought the prodding of others to open up a can of worms this country doesn't need.

That said, we have had popular vote winners lose two of the last four elections.  It just seems like the right time to have a reasoned intelligent discussion of what options could exist to make our voting system the best it can be.

The problem is we are past the point of rational, friendly discussion - which in my opinion is the first step to seeing America fall from its perch. </TEXT>

I live in GA.  Clinton got 46% of the vote but because the electoral votes are "winner-take-all" my vote, along with the votes of 46% of the citizens of GA mean nothing.

States shouldn't be "Blue" or "Red".  They should all be different shades of Purple. </TEXT>

Trump has his victory and unlike the people that are/were Obama-haters that couldn't "come together" to support the legitimate winner of two terms I will support our president because that's what we are supposed to do as Americans.

Look - I'm 52, white and wealthy.  It makes no difference in my small life whether the country is run by righties or lefties (I'm an independent).  But it does matter to me that all citizens have their votes count.

<TEXT> Yes they would.  And at this point with state "winner-take-all" electoral votes there is no point in voting if you live in a state that is heavily red or heavily blue.  

The current system is unfair to *all* voters it just depends on the outcome of a specific election as to who is disenfranchised at that time.

If every vote counts maybe people would feel more engaged.  I know several people that didn't vote because "it won't matter - I live in GA".

I've always fought this mindset but when 2.6 million more people vote for a candidate and they still lose something is horribly wrong with the system. </TEXT>

My thinking is this - removing first the specter of voter fraud via the recounts - the issue could be narrowed to a real and present issue that will continue to affect our country's elections.  However, if the attempt was to overturn/challenge the current election that would be too divisive to the country.  (I can't believe I am saying this - I hate Trump!)

But could a lawsuit be brought simply to deal with the longer-term issue while accepting the injustice of the current situation? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh after seeing this reply I realize the comment was asking about "roof water".

As I clarified in another comment this isn't really a traditional "hobbit house" - i.e. it will not be earthen on the top.  It will actually be solar panels on the south facing side and off grid.

My wife started calling it "the hobbit house" and it stuck.  I prefer "the beaver lodge" because I am building it on a hill overlooking a small pond I have been building with my beaver.  He does most of the work but I help him out sometimes with some clearing and a few strategically placed berms.  :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Water service?  I have already run water from one of my wells about 600 feet away (as well as 100 amp service - although this well be all solar with a Powerwall once I am done with construction and the grid will just be backup).

If you meant water as in moisture I am using a french drain around the foundation and it is on the top of hill so I don't foresee any ground water issues.

In this picture you can see the electric and water on the left side.  Right side you see the septic outflow (I still need to dig and put in the leaching field)  http://imgur.com/a/ZbMz3 </TEXT>

<TEXT> LOL.  You. have. no. idea.

If it wasn't raining Sunday when I did this I was honestly planning on finding 2" saplings to do it in wood. 

I hate that I used PVC but it is serving the purpose to get length and angles for the beams. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Awesome.  I hesitate to call what I'm building "a hobbit house" but that was what my wife started calling and it stuck.

It is really more of a "lodge with a hobbit door".  

It overlooks a pond I have been building with my beaver so I have taken to calling it "The Beaver Lodge".  :) </TEXT>

I did the rough excavation using my bobcat until I hit granite then rented an excavator to get through that.  Flying the drone to get pics I can see where I am several feet out of round on the left side but next step is to find the exact center and mark out the 32' circle.  I am generally already over that size so other than a little clean up once I pour the foundation it will mostly be backfill </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am excavated down 8' at the top of the hill (back of the hobbit house).  At the front the slope of the hill brings that down to 4'.

The walls will all be poured concrete.  I am toying with lining the forms with tree bark to give the walls some texture.  If I don't like that I'll have to come up with a better interior finish.

Current plan is:

-Pour the floor in the round with all plumbing embedded in the floor (I have already dug for the septic outflow)
- embed vertical rebar around the perimeter during the pour
- Form the walls in 4' sections and pour them one at a time using rebar to connect/reinforce each section to the next.  I intend to include 2' conduit in the walls to allow for running of the electric in wall.
- Using pine from my property I will harvest 2' diameter logs varying from 25' to 45'.  Stripped of bark.
- Pour "block" post anchors 1 cubic yard
- Custom welded "anchor brackets" embedded in each block
- Calculate angles.  Recalculate angles.  Once again for good measure.

I am still not sure on how I want to connect the beams.  I was thinking mortis and tenon but I just don't see that working given there are 7 large beams coming together at one spot.  I think I am going to have to come up with a custom bracket to fit them in.  We'll see as we get closer. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not sure.  Works on mine.

Her issue was that I took it a little too far.

After I did the excavation I used a drone to take aerial photos.  Then I took physical measurements including topography so I would have the slope of the hill to include in my ciphering.

I put together the superstructure with PVC to get a feel for the skeleton and get lengths for the logs and angles for the joints.  But of course I was having fun so had to go ahead and the interior touches to get a visual.

Although the model is rough I am very pleased because it has finally taken a design that was stuck in my head and made it concrete so now I can think through were maybe I should adjust the design a bit more.

BTW - this is 1/12 scale.  32' diameter </TEXT>

<TEXT> The morning was still but the children awoke restless. "Can we please go outside today? Please daddy!" Three little faces, young and excited to see the world and all of its wonders.

"Kids, I wish you could go out and play like you used to but for the time being that's not really something we can do" I replied, with my most knowing fatherly grin. "Soon" I confidently added knowing in my heart how much I hate lying to them.

It's been a long four years since "The Revolution" that swept President Trump into power. Amazing in hindsight that none of us saw it coming. Of course until it was too late. We're a republic. The greatest of the great. The world's only true super power. Surely the checks and balances of our great constitution will ensure that no one man can destroy what our fore fathers built.

But Trump tapped into something inside of us that most didn't even know was there. A primal hatred. A pent-up anger against anything and everything "different". We watched the world shift, evolve, and grow for 50 plus years. Never once did we see that our old prejudices weren't fading away. They were just moving deeper into our core - away from view. Away from any ability to understand and address the root of those frustrations. Until it was too late.
Trump swept into power on what initially felt like a minority point of view. But once in office the depth of our country's hatred rapidly boiled to the surface.

At first the changes seemed ugly but manageable - a banning of Muslims from entering our country, a growing Police State to "secure and protect" us all from the ongoing random acts of terror that were plaguing the country.

Oh, and the wall. Don't get me started on the wall. What was the final bill, $4 trillion? And by god, he sure did get Mexico to pay for it. Amazing what fear does to people. Trump was right in the end. With unhinged threats and a finger on the nuclear "option" people tend to fall in line.

My daughter's nuzzling under my chin brings me back to the present. Her eyes pleading with me once more - "Please Daddy?? We just want to go outside and play!"

But this day would be just like so many before. All of us stuck here in this small hidden room. Quiet. Waiting. Worrying if - when - we may be found out. Hiding in our own country for fear that our "differences" were just too much for a citizenry bent on ensuring conformity to "their norm". </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think a big part of how people handle aging has to do with their *true* feelings on religion.  

Those that are honestly 100% believers in an afterlife I think can have a reasonable approach to death however it can affect their outlook on life negatively.  With eternity awaiting you, the need to truly enjoy each and every day is not as important.

Atheists (of which I am one) have a very healthy positive outlook on life and death.  I know I will die and I know that it could be any day from now until a few decades from now.  But it is coming.  And since I don't believe in an afterlife I spend every single day enjoying the day - knowing that I only have a limited number to enjoy.

The people that I think have it the worst are the people that outwardly say they are religious and believe in an afterlife but secret harbor doubts.  It must be scary to live everyday not knowing if you have eternity waiting for you or dust. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's an interesting perspective.

While I do not know the man (never met or seen him in person) two of my partners know him personally (and are in his "economic strata") and they basically say he's nothing but a cheap con-man.  Take that for what it's worth as it is second-hand.

Another one I don't understand is W Bush.  I have always felt he came off as a bumbling idiot (think Gerald Ford / Chevy Chase) but people that have spent a lot of time with him tell me he is one of the smartest people they have ever met.  Go figure.

<TEXT> Awesome!  I have some amazing memories of that computer.

Short story time: When I was a teenager I had a passbook savings account (most kids did at the time).  You would go make a deposit and the bank would stamp a little book that looked like a passport.

I was a big science nerd and saw the ad for the sinclair in probably Popular Science.  Without telling my parents I withdrew all of my money (mostly birthday and christmas deposits) and bought the sinclair.

When it arrived my parents were furious and sent me to my room.  They only made one mistake.  They left the boxes in my room. :)

Nearly 40 years later I have built and sold 2 software companies and am currently on my third.

Best grounding ever.  Little did my parents know that one random punishment would make their lives much easier in retirement.  :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Umm... yep.  I always said that.  Always supported the President that America supported even if I didn't vote for them.

Funny thing though. Somewhere about the time that a congressman decided to yell "YOU LIE!" to the sitting President during the State of the Union address I realized something had changed in my country.

Instead of people eating crow quietly and outwardly providing at least an image of civility and support we had decided to roll around in the mud.

For eight years we have watched a Republican party intent on making their dislike for the sitting President abundantly clear via personal and baseless attacks.

Now you ask us suddenly when they are in power to just act like we did act as a country for decades before their little tirade?

I was not a Hillary fan but I voted for her as my only viable choice to prevent this misogynistic, racist, serial-liar from become President.  I failed.  

And while I will not complain further about the new President I most certainly will not support him.

Bill Clinton denigrated the office of the President.
Republicans furthered the process of devaluing bipartisan support of the sitting President.

Now all that is left is to keep quiet, make some popcorn, and watch this disaster unfold. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Me: 52M - 5'7" 180 Caucasian

I have had 3 cervical fusions and am now fused C2-T1. One surgery resulted in a MRSA infection (fun!). Last surgery was 2 years ago.

Six months ago I started noticing random twitches in my right arm and leg. I also noticed a tremor in my hand (isolated to the fingers - ring finger being the most active).

My hand has started "clenching"/cramping into weird painful positions every few days.

The leg and arm spasms have increased in frequency and strength. They generally happen when I am in a relaxed state (sitting/laying down) but can happen when standing if I am not resting weight on the right leg. I can stare at the extremity and concentrate and the spasm will generally stop until I start focusing on something else.

The spasms are also initiated by a loud sound, bright light, or rapid movement that my eyes detect.

I have just visited a neurologist and am being scheduled for a brain scan. I'm a little freaked out because she said my symptoms didn't fit the normal things she sees.

Am I worrying for nothing or does this sound familiar?

Thanks in advance for any ideas you might have. </TEXT>

This has been a major red flag with Trump from the beginning when he said he wouldn't put his business in a blind trust.

And he won't release his tax returns?

Good luck finding out exactly how and when this guy games the system.  

The country got exactly what it asked for and now all we can do is sit back and watch the shitshow. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You asked a question and then you try with every response to tell the commenter why they are wrong.

You asked why people are full of doom and gloom and they are answering you.

Based on what Trump has said himself - the positions he has said he supports - we as a country can expect a variety of changes under his presidency that many find un-American and harmful to the country.  You might not agree but that fear is why people are all doomy and gloomy.

- Unwinding climate change initiatives
- Reverting to fossil fuels and defocusing from renewables
- Woman's rights, especially as it pertains to abortions
- LBGT rights 
- Withdrawal from free trade agreements

There are more but these the ones most frequently sited.  And note many of these will happen simply because Trump will fill the SCOTUS vacancy with a hard right conservative ensuring that the court stays right leaning.

Out of all the doom and gloom my biggest fear now is that one of the remaining liberal justices passes away in the next four years and my children are stuck with a hard right SCOTUS for the next few decades. </TEXT>

Any other ideas on where to advertise or post that someone in my general area might have a trailer and be open to renting it for a few days?

I'm not even interested in driving it - they can bring it, set it up, and take it away to reduce travel liability.

<TEXT> Oh as a surviving entrepreneur of the dotbomb days I wholeheartedly agree.

A tech founder should never turn their company over to an outsider.  If a capital partner is pushing that then run the other way.  You want a partner that believes in the business you have built and respects your abilities enough to help mentor your growth as a CEO.

In my case however, I never wanted to be a CEO.  But when you found a company it becomes very hard to step back into the tech role that you really want to be in.

My first company, I held the company back because I wasn't an experienced enough business man.  We still did well and sold on the other side of the dotcom implosion when many didn't make it that far.

The next one I founded I said right up front "I don't want to be the CEO.  About a year in we did a search and hired an outside CEO.  It was a disaster.  It was my money but I didn't really try to keep an eye on things.  I just wanted to develop great software.  He was forced out after spending a shit-ton of my money and putting the company in a deep debt hole (including not paying IRS withholdings - that I as primary owner was on the hook for).  I like to say the day he left is the day I became a good CEO.  We built that company, learned a lot, and finally sold it to a public company.

Now on my third, I have sadly gotten so far from the technology and it moves so fast that I can't even think of going back to what I love.  BUT, I have laid out my path to get out of the CEO position.  The board just let me promote the President to Co-CEO and with in a year or so I am hoping to step back and down into doing the fun stuff again - designing software even if I can't code it anymore.  :)

<TEXT> I was looking to rent a trailer to help with overflow sleeping for Thanksgiving this year.  

I use VRBO a lot for rental homes and figured something like that had to exist for trailers.  A quick google search found RVShare.  Had looked a bit further down the search page I would have seen the "F" rating from the BBB - alas I didn't.

So I put in my trailer search criteria in and find two trailers that look like good fits.  I fill out the rental request form and send emails to them asking about availability.  One nice lady (Cindy) replied and we exchanged a series of email and everything lined up great.

So then I get an email from Cindy with a contract and an invoice for the rental - so I pay it through the website.  Then the fun starts.

I start getting weird emails that don't make sense.  Questions I have already answered.  An insurance rider pulling the trailer (I'm having it delivered and not moving it).

After much confusion I realize there TWO different people (both named Cindy) talking to me.  It turns out that RVShare takes your search request and somehow makes it available to its other "renters".  So out of the blue this "second" Cindy just injected herself and sent me a contract - which I paid for.

The trailer I rented is fine - I'm not picky - but it was very confusing, felt like I was being scammed, and ultimately - while trying to figure out what the hell was going on THERE IS NO WAY TO CONTACT RVSHARE other than email - which they haven't responded to.

So unless you are interested in a frustrating, confusing rental with a ting of "what the hell?  you shared my rental request with other people?!?" with a vendor that has provides 0% customer support I would suggest you avoid RVShare.com </TEXT>

Sure Single-Payer Healthcare is a possible solution as is reworking the existing law in a bipartisan way to fix the deficiencies.

<TEXT> First of all it clearly states that this is not a Marketplace plan and you will get no help with the premium but if you go to the healthcare.gov and enroll in a plan that is covered under the federal marketplace you might have a better outcome.

Healthcare isn't free.  It isn't for working people that get insurance through employers.  It surely isn't through ACA.  But it can and is affordable for those that can't afford it.  BTW - total premiums through an employer cost around $2,000 a month (or more) but the employer covers the majority of that for the employee (I know I'm an employer).

Oh wait - I see you are in GA.  With a Republican governor who refuses to accept the Medicaid federal funds that would help lower the premium for those that don't make enough.

<TEXT> I would suggest just changing the cabinet doors.  It's a lot cheaper and the results can be amazing.

We had an old house that had simple plywood cabinet doors.  We removed the doors, sanded the cabinets and used a blue paint/stain on them.  

Then we measured and ordered the custom wood cabinet doors from Home Depot.  Totally transformed the kitchen on the cheap.

My only additional advice is if I had to do it again I wouldn't use Home Depot.  While it was convenient and easy it was more expensive than if you just do a little internet research these days and order them direct.

Edit: went back and looked at your picture.  One other thing we did that you might want to consider is swapping out the counter top with something more durable like Corian.  It will probably cost you a couple thousand but for all in of about $2,500 you can have a sweet kitchen. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   I can't recall ever being insecure about my height. I wrestled in low weight classes in high school and college and I guess I felt that my height and weight we're actually advantages.   I definitely did not see them as disadvantages. 

 By the way  I went to college with a former NBA center that was 7'1". We used to walk to class together which was quite the sight.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> would it be viable to use Verizon phones as hotspots for our household internet access? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-14 20:43:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I posted the other day asking for opinions on Hughsnet to get out of my Windstream hell.  Y'all quickly talked me out of that so here's my new stupid question - could I realistically just use my Verizon phone(s) as hotspots?

There are three people in the household.  My wife and I work from home and are on all day - she is low bandwidth writing code.  I'm on voice Skype calls most of the day.  We have a 12yo that games on his desktop (mostly Ark Survival right now).  We generally only watch one hour of TV per day - Netflix or Amazon.

I called Windstream to find out what our historical monthly usage is but they say they don't track it (cough*bullshit*cough).

Looks like I could get a Verizon plan with 70G a month or so.  Realistically what would the above scenario be pulling a month best guess?

Thoughts? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not a writer but I'll give it a shot:

The morning was still but the children awoke restless.  "Can we please go outside today? Please daddy!"  Three little faces, young and excited to see the world and all of its wonders.

"Kids, I wish you could go out and play like you used to but for the time being that's not really something we can do" I replied, with my most knowing fatherly grin.  "Soon" I confidently added knowing in my heart how much I hate lying to them.

It's been a long four years since "The Revolution" that swept President Trump into power.  Amazing in hindsight that none of us saw it coming.  Of course until it was too late.  We're a republic.  The greatest of the great.  The world's only true super power. Surely the checks and balances of our great constitution will ensure that no one man can destroy what our fore fathers built. 

But Trump tapped into something inside of us that most didn't even know was there.  A primal hatred.  A pent-up anger against anything and everything "different".  We watched the world shift, evolve, and grow for 50 plus years.  Never once did we see that our old prejudices weren't fading away.  They were just moving deeper into our core - away from view.  Away from any ability to understand and address the root of those frustrations.  Until it was too late.

Trump swept into power on what initially felt like a minority point of view.  But once in office the depth of our country's hatred rapidly boiled to the surface.  

At first the changes seemed ugly but manageable - a banning of Muslims from entering our country, a growing Police State to "secure and protect" us all from the ongoing random acts of terror that were plaguing the country.  

Oh, and the wall.  Don't get me started on the wall.  What was the final bill, $4 trillion?  And by god, he sure did get Mexico to pay for it.  Amazing what fear does to people.  Trump was right in the end.  With unhinged threats and a finger on the nuclear "option" people tend to fall in line.

My daughter's nuzzling under my chin brings me back to the present.  Her eyes pleading with me once more - "Please Daddy??  We just want to go outside and play!"

But this day would be just like so many before.  All of us stuck here in this small hidden room.  Quiet.  Waiting.  Worrying if - when - we may be found out.  Hiding in our own country for fear that our "differences" were just too much for a citizenry bent on ensuring conformity to "their norm". </TEXT>

He fixed the problem (so far) and told my wife the problem was that they (Windstream) miscalculated the distance to the substation.  They just went from the substation our address at the road.  But our house is set pretty far back in and they didn't include that distance in their calculation and something about wrong pins or something.  All foreign to me but we'll see how it holds this time. </TEXT>

It is slow but at least keeps us working partially.  Since they are business accounts any data overage is covered by my employer.

I just really, really want the 21st century to arrive faster.  I need reliable broadband and it seems silly in today's day and age, in the U.S. no less, that we can't have open markets so that there is *some* competition to at least keep these providers honest. </TEXT>

No, we are very limited in availability here.  Windstream is effectively the only "hard-wired" solution available.

Which I guess speaks to why their service can be so terrible but customers don't leave.

I would give my left nut to have some form of reliable over-the-air broadband but it doesn't sound like Hughesnet is necessarily the answer.  :( </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-10-12 16:03:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi.  We live in rural GA and are currently using Windstream which is a nightmare.  It goes out frequently and takes days for a service call.

I am considering changing over to a satellite provider and Hughesnet seems to be the most prominent one.

We cut the cord over a year ago and love it other than the interruptions in Internet service that basically take us off the grid.  Both my wife and I work from home so we need consistent access.  We don't really watch much TV - a little Netflix and Amazon but that's about it.  

Has anyone used Hughesnet?  How consistent is the service?  What do the average speeds look like?  The highest plan says "up to" 10MB.  Windstream currently charges us for "up to 25MB" - they should just go for broke and say "up to 100MB" because they never are faster than 15MB when I speed test the connection.

Thanks for any answers in advance </TEXT>

 When you are young and engaged in your career it can be fun living in the city. Obviously there is a lot of culture and nightlife which is exciting when you're in your 20s maybe early 30s. However once you have a family and are far enough in your life that you want to get away from those things living in the country provide you the ability to not have to deal with the people that you cant stand that you used to live with in the city.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One year for Guys-Weekend-Out we went to Mazatlan.

We were looking for something fun to do and this local told us he could take us to an island with a bar and lots of cool things to do.  Sounded like a good time, so we went down to the marina and loaded up on a little boat and went to the island.

A good time was had by all until we were a bit drunk and ready to go back to the mainland and couldn't find the guy with the boat that brought us there.

That's when someone saw a taxi pull up and asked a guy that worked at the bar "how big is this island that you have taxis?"  The bartender said "oh this isn't an island.... more of a ... penisula."

We basically took a boat ride down the beach. </TEXT>

Funny how protestors don't really care any more about what really happened.  If police shoot someone they just start protesting regardless of the situation.

<TEXT> I posted this before on an AskReddit but seemed appropriate to repost again here:

This was toward the end of the year 2000. I was the CEO of a company I had founded in the software industry.

At this time I had never raised capital before. I had received lots of "scam" emails before and they were very easy to spot and ignore. But around this time I received an email from a representative of a supposed "Arab prince" wanting to invest in our company. I ignored it. The guy was persistent and even called my office from London. It just didn't smell right but I was pretty naive. I listened to the man's pitch - he represented an Arab prince that was looking to invest in tech companies - minority investments, no active involvement, yada, yada.

It all sounded too good to be true. So after our call I didn't do anything. The guy persisted. He gave me the name of the Prince (I don't recall it exactly but it had "bin Aziz" in it. I honestly figured it was one of my buddies pulling a prank on me. Finally, it got the best of me. Luckily one of my wife's brothers works for The Company (if you know what I mean). I called him and asked him if he could look into the guy for me and see if it was legit. I sent him the email trails, phone number, names, etc. A day or two later he called me back and said that - yep, this guy was real. He just cautioned me to be careful but said it was at least not a scam. Now I was really kind of freaked out.

I talked with the guy further and we agreed that this prince would invest $3m into my company for a minority stake. Paperwork was drafted up. I was using a very prominent law firm. Everything seemed to be on the up and up.

When the time came to fund, he told me that the prince was going to be in London and if I was willing to fly over it would be a great gesture and I could meet him and sign the papers live. Shit! I had never really been out of the country (Canada and Mexico excepted). I went to my father-in-law who spent many years in Saudi and was fluent with their language and customs. He gave me lots of tips on does and don'ts.

So the time comes and I fly to London. The guy comes to meet me at my hotel to pick me up. He is carrying a large aluminum suitcase like you see in the movies. He informs me that the prince's jet has had an issue and he is not going to be able to meet with me. He asks if I have a private place we can go to execute the agreement. Now this is freaky at this point and just SO OUT of what my life had ever been to this point. I tell him that we can go up to my suite and we do. Once there, he produces multiple copies of the agreement to be signed. As I am starting to review the agreements he opens the suitcase and it is filled with stacks of $100 bills! I almost freaked out. I said "what the hell is that?" He said "this is the prince's $3m investment. I also have an additional suitcase down in my car that the prince asked me to give to you after we have closed the deal that contains another $3m that is personally for you in hopes that you will watch over the prince's investment closely." Of course my first response was "are you crazy??! I can't take CASH. I can't carry money like that back to the US?" He argued with me a bit (in a very nice, low tone) but I just had to say NO WAY and I was really scared by now that something really bad was going to happen. After some tense discussion with me making it clear that I would NOT take cash he left with the suitcase a bit angry.

I returned to the US mostly in shock I guess. When I got back I called my brother-in-law to tell him what happened. He said he wanted to check with some colleagues and call me back. When he did he said I could have very legally taken that cash. And declared it and although there would have been questions I would have probably been fine. He also said I could have opened an account in London (although I don't see how you do that with that much CASH and not raise an eyebrow or two). But then he said, I am glad you didn't. Because what would have happened next is that a few months down the road, you would have heard from the guy again and he would inform you that the prince wanted to invest more. And it would have kept coming until one day a federal marshal would have shown up on your door.

Turns out this is one of the ways (back then - can't speak for now) illicit oil money was getting laundered. The Arabs sell oil outside of OPEC in all cash deals (mostly with China) and then try to buy stakes in small legitimate businesses with rubes like me that will fall for it (that's what the extra $3m was for - to make me say HELL YEAH).

So like I said, not exactly a "scam" but something strange and with scam like feel to it. Good news is we didn't get taken and eventually sold the company in 2001.

TL;DR A real Saudi prince tried to "invest" $3m in cash in my company if I would only carry it back to the US for him. </TEXT>

I'm planning to use DOT5k mix with fiber which dries really fast. 

How long do you think I should let a 8' vertical by 4' horizontal slab x 6" thick sit to ensure no deformation when I remove the form? </TEXT>

<TEXT> What type of business did you engage in?  Computer Software

When did you set up your business?  I founded my first software company in 1998 (sold in 2001), next 2002 (sold in 2007), and current founded in 2009.

Were there other similar businesses when you set up your business?  yes.

What problem did you have to face during the initial years of your business?  For the first company it was the financial difficulties of getting started.  It is capital intensive to get going. 
 
How did you solve this/these problem/s?  I funded my first company personally and did not take pay for 3 years.

How is your business doing now?  Current business is growing fast and with that a whole new set of issues to solve.  :) </TEXT>

In kindergarten my mom was brought in as a substitute teacher.  At first I was excited because, well, it was mommy.

<TEXT> I think what OP is aiming for here is something along the lines of Joss Whedon's super-PAC and anti-trump PSA yesterday.

Let's say you *love* RDJ.  Absolutely love him.  Oh, and you are a huge Trump supporter.  Are you offended when someone you really love as an actor and respect for publicly rebuffs essentially your core political (and possibly religious) beliefs.  

Are you able to separate the art from the perceived slight from someone famous that you really like?

At least that's my take on OP's question.

EDIT: I thought of some examples that might clarify - Jane Fonda and The Dixie Chicks.  When someone that is a fixture in pop culture comes out forcefully against something that you might support how do you reconcile that you still like the artist?  In the two examples provided both parties paid handsomely for having views that were contrary to their core audience. </TEXT>

That one humanized the situation for me because in Caracus the slums on the hills are simply overwhelming.  Unbelievable people have to live in that squalor and the higher up the hill you are the more "successful" you are because we all know what rolls downhill. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 52yo here just to state my opinion.

When I was younger I fell into the "credit" trap and it is even worse today.  "Oh, you need credit so that you can develop a credit score".  Bullshit.  

Once you have credit history and a credit score all that does is drive more offers of credit that drive you deeper and deeper in debt.

"Oh but I'm very conservative and I always pay it off every month".  Until you don't.  "Just this once I can let it roll over because I have out of the ordinary expenses this month for x".  Before you can blink you will *always* have debt - and more debt.

I realize that when you are young you need that bit of help it feels like to get things "greased" and moving in the right direction.  We have all done it.

But the sooner you realize that debt is the devil, PAY IT OFF! and then never do it again.

"If you can't pay cash for it, don't buy it."  My dad told me this but I didn't listen.  Finally once it sunk in I got out of the hole and we never used credit for anything ever again.

Amazing how much stress that relieves from your life.

Advice is worth what you paid for it. :) </TEXT>

- She says her son didn't ding the door but clearly her son admits it and even points to where on the door he hit it.
- She does say OP yelled at her before recording but would love to hear OP's side of that.  I find it a little hard to believe that OP was flying off the handle one minute and then calmly dealing with the situation for the next six.
- She screams obscenities in front of her children as well as making multiple racist statements about OP and his family.

My wild guess is that her boy dinged the door and OP said something about it.  She got belligerent and started screaming and making a scene and that's when OP decided to call the police not to report the damage specifically but also to deal with the unhinged woman.

That said, this is the list of ALL 4-star generals, past and present: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Army_four-star_generals

Now for my apology.  I was incorrect.  I went to the link above expecting to find my Uncle Tom and he was not there.  A quick google showed that I was incorrect.  He was a 3-star general.  Here's his wiki entry: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tackaberry

Regardless, I did confirm the total number of "living" stars in the family is correct at 11.

<TEXT> Oh at every family get-together there are always some very interesting discussions and that's pretty much what I distilled here.

Those that are older see the military through rose-colored 1940's glasses.  They don't seem to understand the world is much different than it was back in the WWII days.  Conversations always turn to the sacrifice that was made and thus the solemn duty to provide world-class pensions and health-care.  While I appreciate people's service they chose the military just as anyone chooses a job.  And while they should have good benefits they shouldn't somehow have something beyond what the rest of America has.  

Then for the younger crowd there is still a defense of military culture but you can sense from them that they do not agree with the endless wars and engagements that are driving so many out of the service and they do believe that the military needs to be re-invented for the 21st century.

Of course they want bigger budgets, larger pensions, and better healthcare.   They just don't seem to understand that nowadays NO ONE other than government employees have a pension and healthcare costs are skyrocketing for everyone else. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 4 star general in the family and a total of 11 stars.  I'm not one of them.

The waste and fraud in the military is not a reason to keep throwing more money at the military.  Especially when you consider that the reason we are wasting so much money is on unnecessary wars and "outsourcing" of military work to for-profit companies.  Companies like Haliburton.

Which was run by who?  I can't remember but seems it was someone that just might have had some influence into starting these wars in the first place and then outsourcing the vast majority of support operations to a company he was the former CEO of.   /s 

Edit: Also, retired military are worried first and foremost about their pensions and healthcare and ensuring that those are protected and growing benefits for them. </TEXT>

If there is a venue clause and he files against someone in, say, NY state and he can find a way through his "irreparable damage" clause to create an inflated claim over $75k he gets this filed in Federal Court.

The defendant (most likely out of state) has to answer the complaint.  To do that will most likely require either NY counsel directly or two lawyers - one in the defendants local access area and an attorney licensed in NY to server as "local counsel".

When you are the defendant there is no such thing as getting an attorney to take a case on "contingency".  That means defendant will have to fork over a retainer fee that will most likely be north of 10k.  And that's before a finger is lifted.

And it only gets uglier from there and without "loser pays" tort reform even if it is eventually thrown out the defendant is not going to get their attorney fees back. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can tell you from experience it makes no matter whether or not a court would uphold his side.  

Our legal system, when used by the wealthy is basically just a big bully enabler.  He can ruin anyone that he wants simply by suing them and they are immediately going to be financially damaged.

Further, I didn't read the whole thing but is there a venue clause int here they are agreeing to?  I would suspect there is.  These unwitting people that volunteer and sign this have no understanding that if he wants to sue them over something, and the venue is set (bet it's NY) the defendant will most likely be out of state and will have to hire NY counsel to even try to defend themselves - which will be very, very expensive. </TEXT>

Until my mid-thirties I could recall the most minor detail of any meeting that I ever had.  I could tell you who attended a business meeting, where they sat, what each person said, etc.  It was a very useful tool in my line of work.

Now 52 and while people still comment on how great my memory is I find that the details are just not there anymore. 

Sometimes I don't even remember a meeting that happened.  And if I do remember it now it all seems "fuzzy".  The context is still there and the overall recollection of what was decided but the "visual" step-by-step, detailed memory simply isn't there any more. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some years ago I became friends with a couple of co-workers and we started going to lunch together.  One was a woman that I had a crush on (now my wife of nearly 20 years :P) and a guy slightly younger than me.  He was really cool to hang out with and a good conversationalist.  We all got along great and enjoyed hanging out after work sometimes too.

One day it was just the guy and me having lunch.  I noticed a gay couple at the next table and they were kissing.  I must have made a face or something because he asked me if I had an issue with it.  I told him that I didn't but seeing them kissing in public made me uncomfortable for some reason.

I guess the timing seemed right so he dropped on me that he was gay.  I told him that it didn't bother me and he was my friend and his revelation didn't change him in my eyes at all.

Then he said "If we are going to be absolutely honest with each other, I think you are really handsome and I have a huge crush on you".

Being kinda of a nerdy computer guy that was never popular with women I was actually beyond flattered that someone of either sex would say that to me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It actually is very easy and inexpensive.

The flat LED round fixtures (large) are about $70 at THD or Lowes.  Dimmer is $15.  You can basically do a room for $100.

It is also very easy for the DIY'er.  You really don't have to know much about electricity to do it right.  

1) turn on the light
2) turn off the breaker and make sure the light went out
3) remove the old fixture.  In most cases you will just see two coated wires and the ground.  If you see more than that it might be beyond your abilities unless you have a little knowledge of electrical work.
4) rewire the new fixture matching to the existing wires
5) pull the switch.  If there are just the two coated wires and ground you are good to replace it with your dimmer.  As with the fixture, if there are other wires you need to do a little more work with a voltage meter to know what you are dealing with. </TEXT>

Another example is light-fixtures.  We went through the house and removed all light fixtures.  Light fixtures always seem to become "dated" as tastes change.  We went with flat round LEDs for all ceiling fixtures.

The are plain, low-profile and really light a room up.  We put them all on dimmers so that light level can be controlled to the occasion.

We use other furniture, rugs, and wall hangings that are easily moved/replaced to provide the color and character that we want in a room. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That is so cool!

We have been building out our dream house for the past few years and are constantly asking the question "why do we have to do it that way?".  

It just seems like there are so many building "norms" that people just become accustomed to so they never think of a different way to do things.

For instance, I love your drain.  No stopper.  We removed stoppers from our bathroom sinks because once we thought about my wife and I could not think of one time in 30 years that we ever filled up a bathroom sink.  But you know what?  Over thirty years I have had to clean those damn things out over and over.  Why have them?

That's just one of many "norms" in houses that if you are willing to think outside the box and create something that works for you and you are happy with - Go for it!

Dare to be different.  :)

Great work OP! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Question about using whole pine logs as beams. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-15 23:38:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi.  I recently found this sub and love it.  You guys are a wealth of information.

So I am currently building a "hobbit house".  I have completed the excavation and I am starting to think through the superstructure.

I have been clearing a different area where I am building a lake cabin and from that work I have probably a dozen extremely straight pine logs that I have cut to 30-35'.  They are anywhere from 12-24" in diameter.  I also have some random oaks that I took down - not sure what I'm doing with those yet.

The roof will sort of a low-slung A-frame.  My thought right now is to have the largest of the pine logs act as the main center beam and then have "ribs" coming into that with mortise and tenon joints.

So question - what's the best way to remove the bark from a pine log efficiently?

Since I am not cutting the logs I assume I don't have too much to worry about with regard to twisting, correct?

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They are called "horse shows".  I call them "f***ing horse shows" because they are so expensive. :)

My daughter rode her whole life to so me and the boys would go along to the shows when they had them to watch my daughter.  But now that they are grown it is *strictly* my wife's thing.

And once she tried to "train me".  1 day, 1 ride, 2 sore balls - nope this sport is not for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Point taken.  

I think your example works for a couple that likes to hike or cycle together - something like that.

But what I was trying to convey is that something that is *important* to you and that you spend an adequate amount of time pursuing is what you should do separately.  If you have some "hobby" that you do once or twice a year that might not give you the "me time" needed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> How thick of a layer of epoxy does this provide? 

I am finishing an office in my detached garage and still trying to figure out what I want to do with the floor.  

I want to do something unique so I've been wondering if there was a way to put down material (like I've seen someone use pennies) and then cover it with like a 1/4 of epoxy. 

Is that doable? </TEXT>

Horses are a very labor/time intensive hobby but then so is motorbiking so as long as you guys organized your "me time" to occur on the same days I would have thought that would be a match made in heaven.

I have a lake and get out there bass fishing when I can in the evenings.  Always nice to see my wife ride by on a horse and wave to her.  We're both having fun and then we regroup up at the house for a Mount Gay and Coke later to "debrief". :)

Sorry things didn't work out for you man.  You had the right idea but the wrong girl.  :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sounds like my first wife (note: now ex-wife).

When your hobby is "spending time with your partner" you are setting yourself up for a co-dependent relationship.

My second (and final!) wife was 180 degrees different.  We love to spend time together but we also both enjoy our "separate lives".  She has her horsey friends she hangs out with.  Me?  I'm more of a loner so I really don't want people around me when I'm having "me time".  But I do go on "Guys Weekend Outs" a couple times a year with my old college buddies and she actually gets excited for when we are going and to hear the stories when I get back.  

Hope it works out for you but hopefully you can get her to understand "me time". </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great point on the internet but honestly I don't want to be stuck inside even with the internet.  I live to be outside building something, fishing, or just wandering around the woods.  When I can't physically do that I hate the idea of just wasting away.

I work just because it is hard to unplug in my job.  You get sucked in and before you know it 7 years has gone by (at my current job).

But like I said, several things in the past couple of months have started to make me take stock.  I have never been one to care about money and "keeping up with the Jones" so that makes it a lot easier to think about the next stage of my life.

I won't ever need to worry about money so I really need to start worrying about ensuring I enjoy every minute and every day I have left.  For a long time that had been my motto but lately I've found myself too focused and stressed about things that are out of my control (the election for instance) and I just need to take this opportunity to step back from my job and find a better balance.

Thanks for listening.

Amazing what one hour with a stranger can do to help crystalize your life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks.  He really was a nice guy but I have to tell you this conversation along with several others lately are really making me start to take stock of my life.

This guy had happy vibrant life.  He was born and raised in rural GA but when he was younger he lived in Atlanta and was a construction manager.  He told me many stories about their lives and there were a lot of parallels to mine.

I was born in a small farming town, lived a fairly happy young life, grew up, moved to cities for work, and then 20 years ago began a shift to the suburbs, and then 4 years ago - to our dream place - a large horse farm in the country.  I'm 52 with the medical problems of a 70yo.  Too many surgeries and damage from my younger, carefree years.

But I'm still commuting to ATL for work.  I putting in 4 hour daily commutes plus long work days.  For what?  I've made my money.  I have all I need.

Now I look at this man and see someone that had a similar trajectory and now is tired, broken, and in pain.  Living his life pretty much locked inside his house.  What kind of life is that?

So I guess in my rambling way I'm saying "is this what we all have to look forward to?" and if it is then I DAMN WELL want to make the most of my next 20 years before that is my fate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your *main* hobby.  To be married for a long time and have a happy marriage it is important that each partner has something that is "theirs".  It's fine to have shared hobbies but everyone needs something that they can call their own.

Definitely show interest in your partner's hobby but because it is not something you have a deep focus on that allows you to ask questions and learn while your partner feels more "in control" and owns that conversation.

Obviously you will have the same situation in reverse for your favorite hobby.

For instance, my wife breeds and rides horses.  I hate them.  But I enjoy hearing about the fun she had with her horses in the evening.

I love comic books and fishing.  She enjoys hearing my stories about the things I am passionate about. </TEXT>

<TEXT> LOL. That was a rollercoaster.

So I agreed to drive up to meet the guy on Saturday morning. He sounded pretty old so I figured it might be better for me to go visit him to see if he had anything good rather than wait for him to come to my place with the books in tow for a trade.

We agreed to meet in the parking lot of a small grocery store near where he lived. I saw an old man sitting in the black Ford Explorer that he described and pulled in next to him.

We made small talk. I didn't want to appear too anxious so we just chit-chatted. He was 74 and in failing health from a work place injury that had broken his back and the subsequent surgeries. He had trouble getting out of his car and needed a cane to walk.

It was clear he didn't get out much and relished talking to a stranger. We talked about life's trials and tribulations for about 20 minutes. I was getting anxious when he finally mentioned the comics.

I asked him how he came to have the comic books. He told me these were his personal books he bought when he was a kid (OH SHIT). He said that he had always tried to get his kids and later his grandkids into them but they never did (ME TOO!).

At this point I was stoked. A cache of comics from the 50-70's that this guy bought and kept his whole life. Then the doubts started creeping in.

He said that the tote were all he had left. He told me when he and his wife moved from NC to GA 20+ years ago he wasn't really caring anymore on the comics. He had two long boxes with all of his favorites along with this tote. Then to add insult to injury he told me that some months after they moved his wife said "what did you do with those boxes of old comics?" That was when he said it hit him that they never loaded the long boxes and he had left them in their old house (NOOOOOOO!!!!!).

I'm worried but, hey who knows. Let's get a look in that tote. We go around to the back of his Explorer and pop the back. Big blue tote with a plastic lid. I slide it forward, hold my breath, and open it.

That was when I felt the crushing feeling. The first thing I see is an old 10 cent Walt Disney missing its cover and a stack of the smaller Archie "digests". I move those out of the way and start pulling out stacks of books - most in fairly ragged shape, a few in plastic. Mostly DC - almost entirely 70's (.15-.20 covers).

I leafed through as we continued to discuss our mutual love of comics. I found a few that I had copies of and when I would find one I would show him and we would talk about the comic.

Ultimately there was nothing in that box worth keeping but as we shook hands to leave I could just see that this tired, beaten down man actually spent an hour talking passionately about something that had, at one point, been a very important part of his life. And now in the end game, he was, I think, just happy to spend a few minutes with a stranger remembering younger, happier times.

I haven't touched my books in 15 years. I'm just getting to a point in life where I have a bit more time to look back and them and remember simpler times. And now I realize that I better enjoy them for what they mean to me and start to think about finding someone that will care for them and enjoy them when I no longer can or want to.

TL;DR: Old guy lost his passion for comics when life beat him down. Spent an hour talking with him about comics and I think he had the best day he has had in a long time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was a freshman in high school in the early 80's I was really into science and excited to start taking biology and physics classes.

Early in the semester the biology teacher stated that ALL LIFE requires sun light to exist.

I questioned that and said given the limited definition of "life" that we have from only what we know on earth today isn't it possible that there are forms of life that don't require sunlight anywhere in their life chain?

Her answer: "Go to the principals office.  You are disrupting my class."

I never took another science class again in my life.  I turned my attention to learning how to program computers and that worked out in life.  :)

<TEXT> This is not correct.

Before the Iranian Revolution of 1979, Iran and the US had entered into an agreement to sell weapons to Iran.  Iran put down a deposit of $400m - basically in escrow.

After the revolution the funds were frozen and never returned.  

Iran "sued" (went to an international arbitration) asking for their $400m back plus interest for the past 45 years that the money was held by the US.  That total, if awarded by the arbitrators, would have been A LOT MORE than $1.7b.

The dispute was settled for this lower sum - $400m plus $1.3b in interest. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So this is a weird story and I'm not sure how it ends yet.

I live in rural georgia.  I have a large stack of roofing tin that I bought 4 years ago and didn't use much of it.  My wife has been bugging me to get rid of it.

So for shits and giggles I put it up on the barter section of craigslist and said I would trade it for old comics from the 60-70s preferably Marvel.  I figured old Georgia farmers probably have comics stuck somewhere in their grandma's attic that they don't need but they do need farm building tin.  I expected no response.

I have had a bunch of other offers so far - from a 2000 car with 40k miles on it to a bunch of new construction materials (doors windows etc.)

I was to the point of starting to think about which offer would be best when I got the call last night.  An old farmer called me and said he had a "big tote" of old comics.  He mentioned a few titles (Sgt Rock for example) that let me know they are most likely silver age.  He mentioned Superman and Batman which I told him were DC then I ticked off some Marvel books and he said "yeah, those are in here too".

So today he is bringing his "tote" for me to look at the books and see if I want to trade him for the tin.

Last night I was like a kid at Christmas waiting to open presents.  I am just dreaming of what cool books might be in there!

But I'm just worried that when I open my presents I'm not going to get the GI Joe with the Kung-Fu Grip but some damn Hot Wheels instead.

I'll keep you guys posted.  Wish me luck.

Edit1: Just heard from the guy and wouldn't you know it his truck broke down on the way so we agreed I will go to his farm tomorrow to look at the books.  He said it's a 22gallon tote full.  Now I have to go another night without sleep. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> CGC is the firm that evaluates and rates comics.

You send them your comic and their experts review it for a variety of things such as spin roll, edge trim, page coloration, etc.

They assign a value from 1.0 to 10.0.  There are also several "types" identified by the color strip on the rating, for instance "restored", "original", etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well let's take those questions separately.

"what do they do during the other times?"  Their real jobs.  Being on a board of directors is not a "job".  It involves several times a year (more when the company is having trouble less when things are flying nicely) meeting to provide insight and apply your specific business knowledge and thought processes to the helping a company develop and evolve its business strategy.  

What other responsibilities do they have? A director also is used outside of board meetings as a conduit to meet other people/companies that may be of value to the company for which the person is a director.  The director may also act as a sounding board for the CEO in one-on-one phone calls or lunch meetings when the CEO just needs someone to bounce things off of.  Directors can be paid in a variety of ways - anywhere from receiving an equity grant that vests over their term on the board or a cash stipend for attending each meeting - which can be anywhere from a few thousand to tens of thousands.

How is the board actually chosen?  That depends on if the company is public or private.  In a public company the board is nominated and voted on by the shareholders.  As a general rule the nominees presented by the company are almost always "rubber-stamped" and elected mostly because very few people actually vote their shares on board issues.

In a private company, to board is usually made up of the major shareholders and CEO.  If there is a person that one of the board members feels could join the board and add substantial value the board members discuss it and vote during a board meeting.  If they agree to add the person a resolution is passed and the individual is added as "an outside director". </TEXT>

<TEXT> Half of my executive team are woman.

Honestly having done this for 30+ years now I can tell you - raw skill for skill - women make better executives in general.  

I personally feel the reason that is so is two fold.  First, women just have a better ability to work through a problem *rationally*.  They use their head and heart which is a great place to lead from.  Men generally use their head and their penis (well - testosterone).  They bully their way to where they are going where women tend to navigate their way there.

Secondly, women have a gender chip on their shoulder and feel they have something to prove.  Men on the other hand (particularly white males) have a sense of entitlement and can be extremely territorial and political.

I realize these are broad characterizations but I've gleaned them from many years of interacting with a wide assortment of executives. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As /u/DrKobbe states a company controlled and directed by its board of directors.  The board of directors meets on some frequency (usually quarterly but sometimes as rarely as annually).  During this meeting the Chairman of the Board leads the board through its discussion as it sets broad strategy, reviews results, and adjusts trajectory as needed.

The Chairman can be either "Executive" Chairman or "Non-Executive" Chairman - the distinction is whether or not the Chairman has an active role in the day-to-day operations of the business.

The CEO generally always a member of the board of directors.  His/Her job is to execute on the directives of the board.  He/She effectively is the active leader of the company.  A good rule of thumb I use is that the CEO should dedicate 80% of their time "working ON the company" and 20% "working IN the company".  Basically the CEO spends most of their time focused on engaging outside the company to help develop its business model.

Not all company have the President role.  It is sometimes combined with the CEO role and other times it is combined with the COO (Chief Operating Officer) role.  Generally a President is in charge of ensuring the company is operating efficiently on a day-to-day basis implementing the CEO's initiatives (which are granular echoes of the board of director's directives.  A good rule of thumb I use is that the President should dedicate 80% of their time "working IN the company" and 20% "working ON the company".

<TEXT> Hi there.  So I have finally joined the rest of humanity and succeeded in finally breaking the screen on one of my Apple products and so I've been forced to upgrade to a new iPad Pro.

I have had this iPad2 (32gig) since it was released about 5 years ago and I have been using it for my work the whole time.  It works perfectly. It also has a Zagg2 bluetooth keyboard and case.  Here's a picture of it:  http://imgur.com/a/Tdi2Z

However last weekend I dropped it on a stone floor and..well... Now it has a lovely spiderweb screen.  It hit on the top left corner of the screen so the only part that has a lot of cracks is mostly that quadrant of the screen although some cracks run the whole way across.  It doesn't really affect the use of the tablet.  Of course someone could replace the screen for about $100 bucks if it really bothered them.

So I would like to help someone out that is in need of a tablet.  I want it to go to a child in need that could use this iPad to help better themselves in school and in life.

In the comments please indicate who you would like to gift the iPad to.  Must be a child/student.  The requester must be an adult guardian of the intended recipient.

Rules:

- Requester must have +1000 combined Karma
- Requester must have been a redditor for more than a year
- Recipient must be an Honor Roll Student (provide proof via PM)
- No PMs will be responded to

All requests received by midnight Friday will be considered and a winner will be selected over the weekend.  Winner will be posted here and contacted via PM for shipping information.

If your request seems sincere be aware I will review your post history.  If your post history does not show that you are a generally good person I can tell you now you won't be selected. 

All I ask is that the winner acknowledge that in the future, when circumstances permit, they will do one nice thing for someone else.  Pay It Forward.

Good luck to all.

EDIT1: Awesome news!  /u/Piyrate has generously offered a white iPad2 that they have as well so I'll be selecting two winners and you will each receive a PM from one of us.  Also, /u/Piyrate made a good point I didn't think to mention.  Both iPads have built-in 4g internet access but obviously to use that you would have to sign-up for a data plan vs. just using free wifi at a hotspot.  I was using AT T on mine which has a $30/mo data plan. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My wife, son, and I frequent a local chain that has two words in it's name both ending in "E". :)

The three of us go every Sat/Sun morning for breakfast.  I also go by myself 3 days during the week when I work from home.

My problem is that I used to work in a restaurant when I was younger and know how hard and unappreciated the work can be so I always like to tip servers really well generally between 80-100% (not like I'm a big spender - weekends the tab is usually $20-25).

Anyway, we have been going there for years and as the staff turns and there are new servers we see some really crappy behavior now - servers aggressively trying to get us to sit in their section, bad mouthing other servers, etc.  

It's just really weird.  I'm just trying to enjoy my breakfast and maybe help someone out a little.  I'm not there for the drama.

What do you consider "acceptable" behavior in trying to "snag" a regular?

For the record, the best servers that were always pleasant, on top of table needs, and friendly seem to have gotten drummed out by the infighting and drama so it might be time to break this habit. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Has anyone ever worked with Lighter Knot? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-18 19:20:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Earlier this year I found an awesome piece of pine lighter knot and made it into a towel rack (album here: http://imgur.com/a/oIQC2).

So flash forward a few months and I found this killer piece that is 21 feet long: http://i.imgur.com/qIx9gPW.jpg

The towel rack didn't take much cutting except getting it flush for the wall.  I want to use this piece as a full base for a long countertop/bar in a hobbit house that I am building.

I've studied the piece enough now to see the generally orientation.  I will be cutting back a fair portion to get to a flat part on the far end that can be finished out as an exposed center grain top, carving out in the center for a stone sink, and then cutting off flat on the last 8 feet closest in the picture and installing a stone countertop on that part.

My question is has anyone ever worked with lighter knot like this? Because of the hardness and high-resin content just doing the rough cut with a chainsaw is hard enough.  I am wondering how the sanding and finishing is done with so much resin in the wood?  I am guessing the friction from sanding will cause the resin to soften and "ball up".

Anyone with experience or pointers on using this type of wood?

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TITLE> How interested are HR Generalists in moving to the HCM software vendor side? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-07 19:40:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi.  If this is the wrong place to post this mods please just let me know.

I have seen posts here on occasion where HR practitioners have asked about how to make the move to the software vendor side of the market with their skills.  I have personally responded to several of those.

So now I have a reverse question.  The company I work for is a provider an enterprise suite of HCM solutions from recruiting through payroll.

We are currently hiring for a variety of positions - implementation, product management, client service to name a few.

We have a lot of senior employees with vast industry experience.  Now we are looking to bring in some more "entry-level" people.  By "entry-level" I mean new to the software vendor market.  Our preference is to get people with backgrounds in corporate HR, Benefits, or Payroll at mid-market sized companies.

So the question - does anyone have any ideas of the best place that we could/should advertise that will get seen by HR Generalists?  

We advertise on a variety of job boards and do get some quality candidates but they are mostly senior folks with extensive vendor side experience.  

How can we find top-notch HR Generalists that want to make the move from corporate side to vendor side?   Do they exist?

Thanks in advance for your thoughts. </TEXT>

<TITLE> This is a long-shot but does anyone know any filming details of the Henry Fonda movie "My Name is Nobody"? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-30 16:57:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So as I get older and important lesson I have learned is "what is important as a memory to you most likely didn't even register with your parents".

When I was nine I remember my father taking me and my brother to watch scenes being filmed for My Name is Nobody.  I remember it was a Western.  I remember seeing Henry Fonda (although I didn't know who he was really.  I remember them asking if we wanted to dress up and be extras.

So I recently mentioned this to my parents and they looked at me like I was from another planet.  No recall at all!

So I went to IMDB to see what I could find.  We traveled a lot as a family during the summer vacations from school.  New Orleans was one of the filming locations and a place we went to fairly frequently because my parents had family and friends there.  But several other locations are possible - Arizona, Colorado - as we did a summer trip out west.

Does anyone have any additional knowledge about the timeframes these various locations were shooting?  What scenes, etc?

As I recall the scenes we were at were kind of that dusty saloon western main street scene filmed outside.

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

- Must be a redditor of at least 1 year
- Must be an ACTIVE redditor with at least 1,000 link and comment karma combined
- Must have a paypal account 
- Must have a *small* realistic monetary need
- NO PMs will be read or accepted

If you meet ALL of the criteria above please post your request as a comment here in TL;DR format.

Hope I can help some of you out today and brighten your day.

Edit: BTW - I only will be on for another 30 minutes.

Edit2:  Wow, no one really needed help today.  Two people asked for a little help but failed to send me Paypal info.  Oh well I guess that is a good thing that everyone is doing well today.  I have to run but I'll try another time.  Peace. </TEXT>

<TITLE> x-post from r/solar - sent here for some guidance on DIY solar work I am looking to do. Details in comments. Thanks in advance. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-06 22:49:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So a bit about my situation that I feel will affect the input people might be able to offer:

I live in rural GA.

I am building a "hobbit house" that will be about 800-1000 sq ft when completed. The house will be underground except for the roof. It sits on the top of a hill with clear view of the sky in all directions. The house is round more or less.

The front will be facing north. 180 degrees of the south face will be available for solar panels. Essentially three large roof sections that are "triangle" shaped that meet at the peak (think of three sides of a pyramid splayed out to only cover 180 degrees.
This will only be a guest house so really just designed for 2 people to live in.

Water is pump driven from a deep well on the propery. This pump will remain on grid.

I am not concerned really about price or ROI.

So - with all this said:
Is there a resource that can pinpoint by GPS the absolute best angle to locate the solar panels?

Are solar panels available in any shape other than square? I was hoping to cover all three "triangle" sections of the roof uniformly instead of in lines of squares/rectangles that don't get full coverage.

How hard is this as a DIY project?

What can I roughly expect to spend?

Are there special considerations required if you are going to have any 220 appliances? (I'm expecting the answer is "yes" and I'll probably try to refrain from having any).

Can a Tesla powerwall be used as a storage device or are there better ways to store and deliver electricity? I want this totally off grid if possible.

Are there resources to estimate the amount of storage needed to operate off grid? A place where you can enter a list of all expected electrical devices and it estimates your usage needs matched against your location and expected solar generation to determine battery needs?

Sorry for the million questions just trying to do a little homework before I embark on this one.

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TITLE> So... will we ever get the Goliath storyline??? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-09 20:49:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I loved Civil War and by far my favorite was the appearance of Giant-man.  The only thing that could have made it better is if the whole Ant-man story line had been with Pym instead of Lang.

But that said, what are the odds we get to the Goliath story-line?  Maybe as an outcome of Infinity War?  They have set it up in line with the comics (somewhat) that growing is strenuous on the body and can make Lang pass out.  And obviously this was the first time (other than in the lab) that he tried this.  In the comics it took a while for the growing/shrinking to take its toll on Pym's body.

If we do get the story do we get the awesome blue/gold Goliath costume?  Can Rudd handle a weighty story like that?  Right now he is positioned as comic relief. </TEXT>

<TITLE> How best to find and hire someone for post-production </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-20 19:09:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm not sure if this is the right sub or not (other suggested subs please if you know them).

My company is trying to have two web commercials produced.  Each will be about 2:00-2:30 minutes.  The second just has a different opening and closing with the same central content and would end up maybe :30 seconds longer.

We have already scripted them out and have recorded all of the video and audio components at a professional studio (with green screen for those shots).  

Now we are trying to locate someone to do the post-production and editing.  We have gotten one quote from a local firm that seemed really high.  We found a website called fiverr that seems to be on the other end of the spectrum in price - so low that it seems like they aren't going to deliver a quality product.

Can someone offer some guidance on where the best place is to find reputable, quality post-production?

Thanks in advance for thoughts or links.

EDIT: Also some of the shots are "product shots" where we had planned to simple record the application being used with screen grab video.  But the local quote said it would be better to "animate" the application which doesn't make sense to me.  Is there a reason to "animate" an application as opposed to using screen grabbed video. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Anyone need a laptop? I have 10 to give away. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-05 19:37:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> FINAL EDIT:  Okay.  The 10 laptops have been awarded.  You can check comments below to see who they went to if you are interested.  I have PM'ed each recipient and asked for mailing addresses so I hope to get them all in the mail over the next couple of days.  If you didn't get one, keep watching.  We upgrade laptops all the time in waves so next time I see a stack sitting around in IT...   Be well all.

Hi.  We recently upgraded some employee laptops at my company and offer the old ones for people to give their kids or donate them.  After all takers there are still 10 left.  They are in good working order and would be good for a student.  Here's a pic: http://imgur.com/g99RrX3

These are all Dells of differing size and models.  IT wiped them back to original Windows 7.  They should have a version of Office (2003, 2007, 2010)on them (OEM), and a version of Adobe standard.

THEY DO NOT HAVE POWER BRICKS.  But you can buy one on Amazon for $15-25 bucks.

So does anyone have a student in need of a clean, solid laptop?  Let me know.

Preference will be given to requests:

- From an adult
- With a reddit account over a year old
- I will review your comment history so if you are a racist or asshole don't bother applying

Thanks for reading.  Hope this could help a few people out.

EDIT:  Must be in the US
           Must have at least 300 Karma
           Post request directly in this thread - Do not PM as initial request
(thanks for the tips /u/rhubey )

EDIT2:  I am glad that this seems to be something that a bunch of people could use.  Make sure you include as much detail as you are comfortable with regarding why you need the laptop and for who.  If you just said "can I have one?" you might want to edit your comment and add some context.  I'll be reviewing the posts in the morning and the 10 I select I will add a reply comment for you and I will PM you for your address.  It will take me a few days to get these mailed out to everyone.

EDIT3: /u/funky_bbq suggested I get some specs so here's what IT had to say: 

All should be windows 7 Professional.  And patched to current as of a month ago.
4GB of memory, 
CPU - 2.53 gigahertz Intel Core2 Duo or 2.53 gigahertz Intel Core i5 M 540
Disk should be 250GB.   300GB

Most of them have a version of Office on the.  A version of Adobe Standard on them.  It depended on when they were bought, what OEM came with it.
These licenses are only for that particular machine and cannot be moved. 

Some of them may have dead batteries.  But they will run if plugged in. 

EDIT4: /u/rhubey to the rescue again.   I have updated EDIT1 to reflect the following:  If you are selected I will post a reply comment so there is transparency on the people that get selected.  I will then PM you for your address information.  NO DIRECT PM's will be responded to. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So we were eating at a Waffle House this weekend.  The booths are supposed to be for 2 or more.  

While we waited for a table to open up there was a table that had 1 guy sitting at it.  He was working on his computer drinking coffee while at least 3 families waited for a table.

My favorite waitress stopped by to say hi (it was her table).  She said the guy had been there over an hour already and had already closed out his tab and gave her a $2 tip. 

We were finally seated, ordered, eat our breakfast, paid, and as we left he was still there there.

It was incredibly rude of this guy.  The waitresses only have a couple tables and obviously live for their tips.

I tipped the waitress just because that guy was being a jerk and suggested I should say something to him - to which she begged me not to.  I asked her if there was something the manager could do.  She said they were not allowed to "speed up" a customer.

I find this so frickin' wrong.  What would happen if you went to get a haircut and after they were done you just said "no, I like this chair - I'm want to sit here and finish my book".  

How do you guys deal with this?  Would it upset you if a customer took it into their own hands to point out to another customer how rude they are being?

Thanks in advance for your thoughts on this issue.

<TEXT> Hi. We are recent "cord-cutters" and have been enjoying life within the walls of Netflix and AmazonPrime Video.
But can anyone tell me if there is a resource for Netflix that let's you know when new seasons of a series that is currently still in broadcast are going to be added?
Arrow only has 3 seasons and I believe the 4th season is being broadcast right now on CW. Do they add seasons after they are complete?

<TEXT> So valuable life lesson.  Never 1-click shop on Amazon on your iPhone at [7].

My wife and I were hanging out enjoying some trees when our trusty old acrylic water bong (12") finally tapped out.  So I whip out my iPhone, Amazon app, water bong, see one that looks about the same and 1-click buy.  Then of course forget about it.

Jump two Prime days forward to yesterday.  My wife walks into my home office with a tiny little box that says "Acrylic" in large letters down the side.  Since I do a lot of home improvement projects my first thought was "oh I wonder what project she wants me to do that needs liquid acrylic applied".

She throws it to me and I open the box to find a 4" water bong.  Seriously.  4" high.  We both started laughing.

So we made lemonade.  Hit it and watched this video. :)

<TEXT> Hi.  I am interested in getting an oil on canvas painting commissioned.  I'm interested in something in this style: http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Signed-Original-Modern-Palette-Knife-HORSE-Oil-Painting-Impressionist-Art-no-framed/1884297832.html?spm=2114.40010508.4.102.omBMwP

It would be of three horses - one on each panel measuring 5' (vertical) x 18" hung with a 3" gap between the panels.  The color palette would be a little different.

The website in the link above seemed interesting as it looks like they do custom work but I wasn't real comfortable with the company as the website seems pretty funky.

Is this the right place (or other subreddit) to try to talk to artists that might want to look at doing a commissioned work? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I am building a master bedroom / bathroom addition.  I decided I wanted a bidet.  I had used one a few years ago while traveling abroad and liked it (It was the old fashioned type that is separate from the toilet - think Crocodile Dundee's hotel in NYC).

I bought the new type that is integrated into the toilet seat.  Here's a quick one minute video of how it works:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sj8nCyrZbY

I strongly recommend if you are doing a bathroom remodel you consider putting one of these in.  

As a smart man once said "If someone ran up to you and smeared shit on your arm would you think it sufficient to just wipe it of with a tissue?"  I think not!

If you have any questions I'll try to answer them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First, I want to thank everyone that submitted nominations.  I read each and every one of your comments and PMs.

There were a lot of deserving people and I am sorry I can't help all of you.  I do have to pick just one.  

I am selecting the nomination that I thought most fully fit with what inspired me to make the post in the first place.

The winner is /u/darthchubby!  Darthchubby nominated his son Tommy.  Tommy has nearly straight A's (dude - a B in economics?  really? I expect you to fix that now!) and is taking AP classes.  Darthchubby has been a long-term redditor and a review of his post history shows him to be a great and motivational human being.  

A personal message to Tommy:  Tommy, you have clearly been a big help to your parents and very supportive of them as they go through some of life's struggles.  Keep being the great young man that you are.  And remember, live is a series of ups and downs.  Never let the "ups" go to your head and never let the "downs" keep you down.  My children had to go through hard times when life wasn't being very nice to my wife and me (yes, I survived MRSA too).  But now as adults they tell me that seeing those hard times as a child helped them understand the world so much more.  It helped them to learn to take the good with the bad and find a way through.   I hope this laptop helps you as you finish up your high school year and hopefully helps you on your way to college.

Darthchubby - please PM me your personals so that I can get the laptop to you for Tommy.  

Also some bonuses for Tommy from other great redditors!

Please PM /u/FauxBoDo  he/she has offered to send Tommy a new HP printer

Please PM /u/discordkitty he/she has offered to reset the warranty to the day Tommy receives the laptop so it will be covered for 2 full years

Finally, I want to thank /u/iamjustjenna and all of the great redditors that helped her make the holidays special for her son Drew.  If you would be willing to PM me your personals as well I would love to send a little something to Drew.  He seems to be a very special boy!

Remember, life is short.  Be a good person.  Pay it forward when you can! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi there.  I just saw this inspiring post by /u/iamjustjenna over on /r/videos:  https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/4204zp/generous_redditors_donate_ps_vita_plus_other/

And I realized how crazy it is to have this thing sitting around my house doing nothing when I am sure there is someone out there who's life it can help brighten.  http://i.imgur.com/TJIy5cO.jpg

I was given this as a "thank you" maybe six months ago for at a speaking engagement that I did.  I brought it home to my son thinking he might want it but he didn't.  Since then it has been sitting on the counter gathering dust.

Time to find it a home.  Here's the ground rules.  I am taking my inspiration from the video link above.  This needs to go to help a great kid who's parents have maybe fallen on hard times.  

1) Must be for a teenager that is in school and getting good grades. (IM redacted report card or other proof)
2) You must have been an active reddit account for at least a year so that I can check your post history to make sure you are on the up-and-up.
3) Must be in the U.S.

Tell me about your child and why your child deserves this laptop.  Requests need to be received by 7:00 ET tomorrow morning (1/22/2016).  I will review all requests tomorrow morning and select a recipient.  I will mail it to you, the parent, and you can make the gift to your child.  No need to tell him/her how or why.  Just make your kid happy.

And finally, once you are back on your feet you must promise to "pay it forward" by doing something nice for a stranger when you are able.  

Deal? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am looking to build a murphy bed on one wall of a room I am building.

Most times when you see a murphy bed in the "closed" position on the wall it is built to look like a cabinet or shelves.

I am curious if it would be possible to have a built-in TV so when the bed is closed the TV is on the wall.  When you open the murphy bed and fold it down the TV would basically end up under the bed - screen facing down to the floor.

Obviously there would need to be all types of thought given to insuring the bed is not "vigorously used" or that at least there is a separate suspension for the bed that isolates movement on the mattress and does not transfer it to the TV.

But would the TV electronics be damaged by being in that position?  I would expect the bed to be very seldomly used (guests basically).

Interesting idea or disaster waiting to happen?

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Because Snoke will be CGI could they have created a "fake" CGI skin/design for the character to be changed at the last minute to prevent any leaks? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So question here.  I am not very familiar with the process for generating movie CGI other than the general process - reference dots, motion capture, and then... magic.

It seems that when the animators are developing the "skin" for the character couldn't they fairly easily use an entirely different "skin" during development and testing of the footage and then "swap" it out at the very end to a DJJ skin?

If the voice is being done differently (under the theory that JJ's original voice was a disguise) they could have near complete footage with a totally different character design for Snoke that gets switched out late in the game to help maintain the secrecy.

Anyone versed in the CGI process?  Is this viable? </TEXT>

<TITLE> CEO and business man here to support this theory strictly from an economic perspective. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-02 16:06:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi there.  

So I happened upon this theory when it was first posted to /r/bestof but before it got the wind under its wings.

I'm a 51yo successful business man.  I've founded, built, and sold three companies.  Currently CEO of a software company.  Casual Star Wars fan. 

I enjoyed the original trilogy as a teenager.  I can't say it was "life-changing" but I enjoyed it.  (I was more of a Star Trek guy).  But just like any parent of the OT generation I lined up with my little boys and their friends for the prequels. Man was I disappointed and no disappointment flowed more than from watching that wretched Jar Jar Binks.

My boys grew up thinking the prequels were amazing (along with Clone Wars).  I personally just couldn't give two craps.

But then this theory.  It totally floored me.  Not because of the SW minutia.  I get many of you live and breath Star Wars.  But I think there is a large population out there like me.  We remember it fondly and yet believe the prequels were silly, badly acted movies.

Enter Disney.  Now if I am anything, it is a huge comic nerd.  Make Mine Marvel.  I've watched with glee as Disney has transformed my childhood dreams into fantastic movies exactly as I imagined them.  

And then they bought Lucasfilm.  As a business man I simply looked at the price and thought, damn - that's going to be a very nice deal for them.  I had seen how they could exploit acquired IP with Marvel.  So the real question here was how could they exploit the existing library of content while deriving future value by creating new content.

Everyone has been focused on the future - new SW movies every other year with anthology releases between.  Awesome!

But now this theory uncovers a scheme so brilliant that even the Emperor would bow to it.

I don't yet believe that this theory is something that Lucas truly dreamed up in depth.  I think there are kernels of truth to his original plans to make Jar Jar something bigger in the prequels.  But the big, big bad?  I'm not sold that Lucas really thought that far ahead, planned it, abandoned it, and then never spoke of it ever again.

Disney?  That's a different story.  So I just bought 4b worth of IP.  The OT is gold - mined over and over in every possible format.  The prequels are the red-headed stepchild.  How do you make more money from them?

If this theory turns out to be correct Disney will have successfully turned one of the most historic franchises ever into a multi-decade "The Sixth Sense".  Everyone with even a passing interest in SW will go back and watch from the beginning to see how they could have possible missed this.

Investment tip: Buy Disney (DIS).  On its own it is a nice long-term stock to hold.  But imagine if this theory is correct.  A booked asset they they hold will rapidly rise in value.  Not a very risky bet to make. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Can someone help with some questions I have about 4" PVC drainage pipe? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-10-29 14:17:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am building a large natural swim pond.  I have made some mistakes along the way and am learning as I go.

I am in the process of "reversing" my pump system because I didn't really understand the limits of "pushing water" vs. "pulling water".

I have a very high-capacity waterfall pump (17,500GPH).  I buried 4" PVC drainage pipe below the water level from one end of the pond back around behind the waterfall on the other end.   I immediately saw the flaw in my logic because when I started the pump it almost immediately became "water starved".  Effectively it was pushing water more quickly from the holding cistern than the 4" input pipe could supply more water.  Well shit!

So now I am going to need to reverse my thought process and run 220v to the other end and move the cistern down there so that water is pumped from the main pond down to the other end to run the waterfall.

Here's my question.  The pipe I buried is 4" PVC drainage pipe that is stamped "not for pressure".  Since I was using it to "pull" or "draft" water before I didn't see this as an issue.  The outflow from the pump is 3" PVC.  So reversed the pump will outflow at 3" with a ball valve.  Then it will expand to the 4".

Now when I reverse it, I still don't believe there will be "pressure" since the pipe is not constrained - it runs along the pond and then is open at the end feeding the waterfall.  The only pressure would be caused by the 10' climb to the waterfall head.

So my questions:

- Does anyone see a "pressure" issue that I should be concerned about regarding the integrity of this pipe?
- I do have two 90 degree turns along the pipe path.  Pushing water through those turns now do you think that would cause me any pipe integrity issues?

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello /r/assistance[1] . I've always enjoyed this sub and have tried to help as many people as I can. Now I need your help!

Trey Mills is 4 years old. He was born with a rare overgrowth syndrome called Proteus. There have been only 200 known cases of Proteus Syndrome in the world. The overgrowth can cause differences in the appearance and growth rate of various body parts and is typically asymmetrical, meaning it does not affect corresponding body parts similarly. In Treys case, it has affected the entire left side of his body  inside and out. Because of this,Trey has had both his left leg and left ring finger amputated.

In his short lifetime, Trey has endured over 400 doctor appointments, 16 sedations and nine surgeries. Every three to four months, Trey undergoes a complete internal MRI to determine if his internal organs are growing. In July, Trey was diagnosed with severe lung disease and is currently waiting to go on the double lung transplant list in Missouri. - A link to his facebook account for those that want to follow: https://www.facebook.com/HopeForTrey?fref=nf[2]

We are working with Scarborough   Friends Foundation to sponsor a charity golf tournament with all proceeds going to Trey and his family. If you happen to live in the Atlanta area and would like to field a team, please follow the link at the bottom of this page.
On that page you can also donate directly to Trey's cause using the Donate button.

Additionally, we are raffling off a custom Hulk Chopper (http://i.imgur.com/W59mHmL.jpg [3] ). You can purchase raffle tickets from the web page as well.
Thanks in advance for your generosity and support!

<TITLE> Can anyone help me figure out what issue of the Incredible Hulk I am thinking of? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-20 20:14:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Background: I was born in 1964.  When I was young my dad would take my brother and me to the barber to get our hair cut.  The barber had some old comics.  Those were the first comics I ever read.  I can't tell you how old I was but it had to have been in the early 70's.  I know that I was into comics by the mid-70's because I distinctly remember buying the Uncanny X-men when it relaunched in 1975-6.

I don't think the image I am remembering was a cover - I have looked through a library of hulk covers and don't see anything like it - so I think it was most likely an opening inside "splash page".

It had bruce banner washing up on an ocean shore obviously recovering from a transformation from the hulk.  I can't remember much more but I remember him on his hands and knees crawling from the surf.

Any big Hulk fans out there that might know which issue I am thinking of?  I would like to find this issue and add it to my collection since it was the first comic I ever remember.

Bonus: I also recall back-bin comics from a drug store where they would cut off half of the front cover and sell them for a nickel.  There was a daredevil one where he is throwing away his sunglasses (or something else  - I can't remember) in a trash can.  I didn't know who Daredevil was at the time so I didn't realize he was blind.  I just remember his sunglasses I thought were cool.  I would love help finding that one too if anyone recalls it.

Thanks. </TEXT>

<TITLE> What is the best way to level a warped slab of walnut? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-29 20:39:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I purchased a 12 x 2.5 ft slab of walnut that is about 3 inches thick.  I am planning to use it as a vanity top in my master bath.

It was aged outside in a free-air stack under about 5 other layers of slabs.

Now that I have had it for a month or so laying in my addition I notice that it has a slight warp across the depth of the slab - no more than 1/4 inch.

What is going to be the easiest way for me to level the side that will be up?  The cabinets will be custom built so I figure I can adjust the top of the cabinets to accommodate the warp on the bottom side.  But on the top side - how can I level it?  Would it be better to sand this or plane it?  Any other ideas? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see a lot of scams in business but this one was a bit too well done in my opinion.  I could easily see a smaller company that doesn't have good financial controls in place falling for this.

With sites like linkedin it is pretty easy today to figure out who an authorized executive is at a company and who runs finance.  A little legwork will get you the naming convention for the email addresses.

This email was sent to our director of finance yesterday: http://i.imgur.com/7Nwn9gt.png

It was was spoofed to look like it came from the president and included a mocked up chain of emails where he agrees to a wire apparently.

Luckily we have procedures that require the wire be signed off on by an executive or I could easily see a wire flying out the door. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-02-17 20:39:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello.

I had some beams from an 1840's cotton mill cut into planks that I plan to use on my outside porch ceilings. 

These porches are covered so they are not directly exposed to sun nor rain.

I have the same boards down throughout the house for flooring and those are being finished with just wax to highlight the grain and color.  I would like the outside ceiling to do the same but I am concerned that even out of the elements it might need a more substantial finish but I really want it to be as natural as possible.

Anyone have experience finishing heart pine in this or a similar situation?

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's the /r/bestof linked post: http://np.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/2uo1cf/update_on_the_hulk_chopper_i_won_in_a_charity/

The charity is Scarborough and Friends. http://scarboroughfoundation.org/

I have always enjoyed donating to charities where you know that every penny is going to help people. Sam's transparency let's you see exactly who is in need of help and how your donation is changing their lives.

That said, when Sam brought the chopper to my office he let me know that he and his wife are ending the foundation after this year. Here's an article in the local newspaper about it: http://imgur.com/mDIUXFj 

The reason they are ending the foundation is that with a charity this closely focused on the actual recipients the emotional toll was just becoming too great. They lost a sweet little 5-year-old girl this past November and it hit them very hard.

I have tried to talk to him about continuing the foundation but stepping back enough to not get so emotionally attached - because you are going to lose a few. It's just the odds.
More important I think is looking at how many people you are helping overall.

If you guys could, please visit the foundation's website above. Even if you can't donate it would be great if you could hit the "contact us" button and send Sam a nice note letting know what a great job he is doing and encourage him to keep going!

Thanks for listening. Hug him gently Reddit! :) </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-01-16 15:27:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have perused the interwebs and see quite a few horror stories.

Here's my situation, and first of all I am not a "woodsmith".  I am a "learn as you go" kind of guy and I am more than willing and happy to make mistakes and learn.

That said, I am wanting to do a 12' vanity top in the master bathroom I am building.  I want it to be done from a single slab of wood about 4" deep with a live edge.  The plan would be to carve or router out the two basins directly in the wood as shallow sinks that will drain directly down a throat through the bottom down to the U trap.

I have a lot of land and some very large trees to pick from.  Species I have that would be large enough are pine, oak, poplar, sweet gum, and *possibly* maple (although I haven't seen one big enough yet while walking the woods - I might find one).

The sweet gum wood I've seen is very beautiful and I'm really leaning that way over the oak.  The poplar and pine are just too soft I'm thinking.  

Has anyone ever slabbed a 4" or larger slab from a sweet gum?  Can you share your experiences if so?

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My daughter is getting married in Cancun Mexico on October 4th and I have charted a large catamaran for the day before for a fun day in the sun. There's an open bar, lunch on the beach at Isla Mujeres, snorkeling, etc. The wedding party is all going but its a big boat and there is room for a few cool, interesting redditors that might happen to be in Cancun at that time that want to enjoy the day us.  Everyone is generally couples in their 20's other than my wife and me (and our youngest son who is 10).

So, do you want to go sailing with us?  If so, PM me. </TEXT>

<TITLE> What is the safest way to empty an external propane tank? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-20 19:47:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We have a large propane tank in the yard that used to be used for the house.  We switched over everything to electric and called the gas company to come pick up the tank - fully expecting that they would credit us back for the remaining propane in the tank. 

Instead they told us they can't take back propane but charge $85/hour to empty the tank.  If I didn't know better I would say they are a subsidiary of Comcast.

What is the safest way for me to vent/release the gas myself?  Is there a safe way to do it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> My daughter is getting married in Cancun in October.  I have chartered a large catamaran for the day before to have some fun.  Open bar all day, snorkeling, and a beach lunch on Isla Mujeres.

It's a big boat and there are only 20 or so people going so I thought it might be fun to try to find a few redditors that might be in Cancun then that might like to enjoy with us.

EDIT: to be clear, yes this is serious - I guess I should have put a tag on it.  [Here's a pic of the catamaran we'll be taking out that day](http://i.imgur.com/wEGkhCv.png) </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been a software developer, entrepreneur, and CEO. All have pluses and minuses.

Developer - pros: mentally challenging, fun, good pay, work freedom, dress and appearance not too important. cons: you build it and someone makes a mint from it but it's not you. Not a great deal of upward mobility.

Entrepreneur - pros: total control of your work life, exciting, broad painful learning experiences, chance to make a mint. Cons: requires lots of sacrifice (work and personal) to be successful, work for little to no pay for quite a while, hard to get back into the corporate world (mentally) if your venture fails.

CEO - Pros: Good pay. Total control. Cons: Never "off the clock", hard to have life/work balance, immensely stressful as every decision affects the company's success and your employees' futures. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-02-14 21:09:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My father turns 85 on March 8th. My mother, all of the children (5 of us), 12 grandchildren, and 3 great-grandchildren are throwing a surprise birthday party for him on Feb 28th. 

We created an album for him of old pictures through his life and each child wrote a personal note to him here's a redacted copy of mine that I posted in response to an Askreddit question about [how old is too old to have children](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1xijy9/how_old_is_too_old_for_having_kids_serious/cfburz8?context=3)

When I was posting this comment it dawned on me that I have seen Reddit do some amazing things and maybe, just maybe, it could help me out with something.

You see, my father has had an amazing life. He grew up in the Great Depression in the heart of the Dust Bowl. His parents both died when he was very young. His siblings were split up. He was raised by his Aunt Mimmee. From that humble beginning he picked himself up, joined the Army, later got a job as a deckhand on a barge, and stayed with that same company his entire life. He has been married to his sweetheart for over 60 years. He succeeded in raising 5 children and sending us all to college. He was my best man at my wedding. 

Several years ago when my oldest boy was getting really deep into music I would write lyrics (I'm a bit challenged musically - but I tried). He would record the songs with his little band and it was kind of fun.
But I wrote one set of lyrics that I never gave to him. It was the story of my father's life. Now seems like the perfect time to see if someone could make it into a song that I could give him a recording of. My father was raised on country music. When I hear these lyrics in my head they are much like a Johnny Cash song. You know how he would not so much sing as he would talk?

So here's the request - does anyone have (or know of someone who has) the musical talent to put these lyrics to music? Maybe just with an acoustic guitar? You can even change some of the lyrics if they don't work (again - I'm kinda challenged musically).

Here are the lyrics if anyone can help. Thanks in advance. It's called "Ode to Billy"

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have had four people that I have known die of cancer.  One died within weeks of being diagnosed with stomach cancer.  The other three however went through the torturous multi-year process of fighting the disease.  In each case, there were times when the person looked literally near death - frail, tired, unresponsive.  Just not themselves.  Then in each case a few weeks before they finally died they suddenly perked up.  Not a little.  A lot.  They got color, energy, and seem excited about the future.  If you didn't know it you would bet these were healthy happy people planning to live a long prosperous life.  And then, the downfall comes fast and furious and in a matter of days they are gone.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi fellow redditors.  I am building a natural swim pond and have no idea how to do it.  I am learning as I go and so far it has been fun.  If it comes out half as good as I have in my head I will be happy.

So far I have put up two other posts [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/aquaponics/comments/1vv2lf/im_building_a_natural_swim_pond_and_was_wondering/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/aquaponics/comments/1wnf1a/building_a_natural_swim_pond_first_update_details/)

Several folks have asked me to provide updates as I go so I think I will just start an Imgur album and add pictures there each time I provide an update so as the project progresses people can see back though each step.  Do you think that makes sense to do?

So the [picture here](http://imgur.com/nNFfq8D) shows the completed excavation.  I have added some text to show the rough design but it is evolving as I go.  I am really interested in making this an interactive learning exercise for all of us if you guys are up for it.  

Please provide design and engineering ideas and tips as I go and I will attempt to incorporate the ones that the supervisor approves (my wife :)) and I'm sure from replies to my prior posts there will be some great engineering tips/ideas to keep me from any big whopper errors.

My next big decision I need some votes on is whether or not to put in a liner.  The three choices are a) no liner b) liner on bottom only or c) full liner up and over the edges of the pond.  See my prior posts.  There is very low seepage as this is deep Georgia red clay.  My personal leaning is toward (b) but please convince me otherwise if you have reason to believe that won't work.  I do want to maintain fairly clear to very clear water and their will be some fish in the pond (a few bass and some bluegill).  I will be seeding the waterfall with crawfish fry and tadpoles in the bio mass shelves.

Let's do this!

Credits for submitted assistance so far:

/u/momma_dukes directed me to some great books to learn the basics

<TITLE> What is the best way to control water flow rates remotely? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-23 16:38:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am building a natural swim pond and I am planning to have a large waterfall on one end.  It will be circulating water from the pond via a PVC pipe from the other end of the pond using a high-volume pump.

What I want to do is be able to control the waterfall flow rate.  I've found any number of remote controlled water values but they only allow for on/off (really look to be used to remotely turn off the water main to a house when a pipe breaks).

Does anyone know how I could best accomplish this?  Ideally it would operate similar to a dimmer switch on a light fixture allowing me to increase or decrease the water flow remotely.

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Reddit military and China (Ming Dynasty) historians - Help please with this cannon please </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-07-05 19:39:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My father-in-law recently gifted us a Ming dynasty cannon from the Great Wall of China that has been in  his family for many years.  Here is the history as he related it:

"My grandfather (mother's side) Reynolds J Burt (USMA Class 1896) commanded the 15th Infantry Regiment (The Can Do Regiment) in China just before he retired in 1937.  I am guessing that he went to China in 1934.  He traveled and hunted a lot while he was there.  He told me that on one of his trips he visited the Great Wall of China and showed some interest in two identical cannons.  His hosts gave them to him and I first saw them at his retirement home. He subsequently gave them to his son, R J Burt Jr USMA Class 1920.  They  have been passed down in the family until they were given to me.  I gave one of them to the Fort Jackson Military Museum when I was in command there.  The museum showed me pictures of such cannons in China and dated them around the time of construction of the Great Wall.  They could not determine the actual date of the cannon hence the date range on the plaque.  The museum's data showed that the cannons actually had no recoil, in that the powder backed behind the ball when ignited blew the ball out the front and let the force of the blast escape to the rear.  Hence no need for a strong superstructure.  The pictures the museum also indicated that the elevation mechanism could provide almost no height to the shot and the cannon must have been aimed at targets at a lower elevation. The assumption was that they must have been placed on the wall and fired downward at enemies outside. "

[Here are two pictures of the cannon and the plague](http://imgur.com/J4ZZG76,8iJpOWI#0)

I would like to find out any information you guys might have about this cannon.

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> background: I was in a little fender bender recently and needed a replacement bumper for my truck.  I found one on Craigslist.  I called the guy and he seemed like a nice guy on the phone.  He said he had to take his son to an appointment so if I needed the bumper he would send me his address and leave it on the porch for me and I could put the money under the mat.  He offered this to a random person responding to a Craigslist ad.  I asked him if he had a PayPal and he said he did.  So I sent him the $50 for the bumper.  He told me he had to come into town every week for his son's medical appointments and he would call me the next time so we could arrange to meet for me to get the bumper.  

He called me last night and it turned out his son's appointment was at Children's Hospital about 1 mile from my office.  I met him there for the exchange.  While talking with him he told me with a bit of emotion that his 17-year-old son had cancer.  From some comments he made I could tell that money was tight for him and his family.  As we left, I offered him all of the cash in my pocket.  He refused.  Pride is a dangerous thing.

So I PayPal'ed him when I got back to the office and told him to buy something for his son to keep his spirits up and to pay it forward someday to brighten someone else's day (note in comments)

Think how bright this world would be if we all could just pay-forward just the smallest amounts to brighten other people's days.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> my son actually recorded this one and it was by far my favorite he did before he left for college - I called it "Shake" - he called it "Tsunami" and fixed some of my crappy lyrics. See what you can do with it. I've uploaded his version here: (http://picosong.com/FrM2)


Shake it up Shake it up Shake, shake, Shake it up
Now... knock it down!!!
(Kick ass solo or fat bass line here)
Sometimes the world's Gotta change overnight
Shake itself free from This human cancer - that's right
There I said it and you should too We're all rapists its just different victims we do
Some rape the flesh And some rape the mind But we all rape the planet From time to time
So I say
Shake it up Shake it up Shake, shake, Shake it up
Now... Drown it out!!!
(short very drum solo)
Bring the holy water To wash away our sins And with nothing left standing Mother Nature wins (Background yell: water attack, super effective!)
Now Burn what remains Make the world pure
How do you kill a cancer? Use a radiation cure
So I say
Shake it up Shake it up Shake, shake, Shake it up
Now finish the job man... Radiate us all!!!
(Big guitar solo)
Burn baby burn Burn baby burn Burn baby burn Burn baby burn
Hell on Earth baby WE ALL NEED TO BURN! </TEXT>

But you leave me no choice
You're tearing me down
With your belittling voice

Don't need to reach the speed of light
Just the speed of sound
I'll escape your droning
If I just hold my ground

I can't hear you
I'm already mach+1
Just out of earshot
A man on the run
You lost control of me
at mach+1

Push on that pedal
Ass to the sun
Need to outrun
Your sonic gun

Your words are your weapons
You taunt me for fun
My only defense
Is mach+1

I can't hear you
I'm already mach+1
Just out of earshot
A man on the run
You lost control of me
at mach+1

I hope you heard
My sonic boom
I just passed mach
And I'm running on fumes

Held out of reach by this
God damn gravity

I see the stars
Up in the sky
Flashing lights of
dreams gone by 

Oh, Left to right
Oh, Left to right
Left to right
I'll follow these stars tonight

Across the branches
of my life
From deep in my roots
These dreams take flight

Into the night
Up in the sky
Fleeting lights of
dreams gone by 

Oh, Left to right
Oh, Left to right
Left to right
I'll follow these stars tonight 

My tattered dreams
Sit high on your shelve
Still beautiful after
All this pain

But still no closer
Still out of my reach
I can't make them mine
Just this useless rhyme

Now I'm Left to write,
Oh, I'm left to write
I'm left to write
This mournful song
Tonight

It wasn't right
The way that you left
A crushing blow
Your thoughtless theft

My fears they roost
close to home
You stole my dreams
And left me all alone

Oh, Left to right
Oh, Left to right
Left to right
I'll follow these stars tonight

Now I'm Left to write,
Oh, I'm left to write
I'm left to write
This mournful song
Tonight

You left me right
You left me right
You left me right
On the razor's edge 
Tonight

Advertising and the internet seem to be enabling obese people to be "okay" with themselves.  

Isn't this ultimately perpetuating the problem and just making it worse? </TEXT>
