<TEXT> I think Vox really should drop the 'Young millenial lecturing you poor, uneducated savages on how the real world works.' By that, I mean where the anchor is sitting there and telling you their slant.  It really comes off as [talking down to your audience.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FUqj6z_E_I) Seriously, get Ezra off the camera.  He is awful and condescending, which is what triggers the die-hard Alt-Right, but also makes Vox look like hardcore Liberal to the Centrist.

This works only a couple of times, in my opinion.  Mainly when they use people like Carlos Maza, who has a bit of personality and throws in some [Daily Show-esque charm into the video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFCPdVtB8gI) He has only a few videos like this, and they're much more engaging and fun than Vox's more serious stuff.  It also works as an interview format.  I show their [hip-hop video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWveXdj6oZU) to people all the time.

When Vox wants to do serious, they should just cut the sitting man/woman all together and just do voice over.  Their best work is when they do that. [Their gun violence one in particular, no matter how you feel on the issue, is very slick.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bX4qUsgHa4Y) Mind you, this still triggers the Alt-Right, but at a sheer presentation value, I think style has a lot more reach then their sitting lecture style.

<TEXT> This seems to be going for a more unsettling atmosphere than your typical, 'Terrorists have taken over the bank!  Go kill em'!'

The imagery of that violent gore, the fetish club, a dead kid, a school shooting, religious cult(?), and human trafficking are not something you'd usually see in these types of games.  There's usually a more jingoistic approach to these scenarios, and what violence innocents suffer seem detached from the rest of the game.  This seems to be nose diving into those uncomfortable realities.  I'm genuinely curious how you guys are going to approach this subject matter.

Seeing as how the devs are in this thread, are you trying to approach this genre with some form of commentary about crime/policing and the glorification of what these men and women go through? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you pay the 1,600 a month yourself, or do you share that with roommates?  Because I, making 55,000 a year at 28, couldn't possibly afford that rent by myself. That's just over a pay period's paycheck.  I live and work in the city as well, so I need a roommate.  

And according to this: http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/05/11/are-you-in-the-american-middle-class/ I'm considered middle class.  

I'm also paying around 600 a month in student loans, which is also a huge factor in deciding how I want to invest this money.  Though I have a very stable job in the field I enjoy, I don't want to make any long-term plans with a home unless I have the ability to be more flexible with it.  And while getting two month's rent back from taxes sounds nice, in the long run it doesn't make sense to me right now.

I guess what I'm saying is that everyone's personal experience is different, but Adam's videos are usually backed by statistics rather than personal anecdote.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> This video doesn't really go into the fact that there are also Anti-Ballistic missiles that are probably positioned all over South Korea and Japan, plus any number of submarines in the sea.  I'm betting there's round the clock surveillance of NK, so the moment these sites detect a launch, the ballistic missile has shot the Nuke out of the air, and North Korea has become glass...

North Korea may have the ability to launch nukes, but I doubt they have the numbers to overwhelm American defense or have the technology to counter the Anti-Ballistic missiles we'd shoot the nukes down with.

I think part of the real reason we're hesitating is that we're trying to figure out how to deal with NK without a huge loss of civilian life.  The North Korean government is not the people's fault, and how would it look to bomb an NK concentration camp filled with innocent people?  It's a humanitarian issue on top of a rogue nation issue.

This video is a very 'war game' approach to diplomacy, which is fine, but like China told Trump, this shit is complicated...

<TEXT> Sorry, but you should look at the stats.  The Russians faced the brunt of that war.  Their experience was beyond what an American could comprehend at that time.  Sure, War is hell on all fronts...  But the Soviets were in a deeper part of hell.  Stalingrad is a good example.  

That battle was fought for 6+ months, and they lost just under 500,000 people.  The Germans lost 700,000 too.  Those are numbers so outside the American experience of both WW1 and 2. 

The most lost in an American battle during the war was the Battle of the Bulge, which was just under 20,000.  Despite what the media presents, Soviet blood won that war. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think people put too much relation on the law as the morally right thing to do.  Laws are created by politicians, and sometimes what they want is not really the morally right thing.  For example, I think arresting people for marijuana possession is morally wrong, but it is illegal.  You can recognize the law and also have your morality placed against it too.

When he got punched the first time I was like, "Yeah, that makes sense.  That was bound to happen." I felt it appropriate and also recognized that it was technically assault.  Punching that dude was illegal, but yeah...  Assholes like him deserved to be punched.  But you got to know that you're committing a crime, and be willing to face the consequences of that.  That's why he was wearing all black, covered his face, and ran away, lol </TEXT>

Yeah, I remember that mod!  It made everyone look more gritty and worn down, and it added a bunch of environmental stuff that made certain narrative scenes stand out more.

What I'm curious about is if they can rework the lipsync to be better...  From what I've been reading, the dialogue runs on an algorithm that creates accurate lipsync to match what's being said.  I don't know much about code, but is that a simple fix or something that'd need a LOT of work and testing?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> You should probably visit Washington D.C. for the 4th.  That's America's Independence Day, so there's probably going to be a lot of fireworks and excessive patriotism during that evening.  Also, if you like Museums, D.C. has a BUNCH of free ones all next to each other.

I'm from Atlanta, so I'd recommend my city for more trendy, foody kind of stuff, but we're lacking in major attractions.  Savannah, Georgia is a really cool look at the American south, and you'll get a lot of history not only in museums but in the architecture too.  

Just be mindful that the U.S. is a HUGE place, and you probably won't be able to do a ton within your time frame.  have you thought about limiting your trip to one coastline? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I've played a few hours and I think that the start is fine.  Not great, not terrible, just fine...  I'm hoping it'll pick up when things open up with the open worlds.  Look at it like a rough pilot for a possible good series and that may sway you a bit later.  It took the Expanse an episode or two to get going...  Maybe Mass Effect needs room to breathe before it gets good.

I don't really think the writing and voice work is that bad.  There's a scene getting tossed around where Ryder tells two people something about his/her family.  Yeah, that scene could have been better, but it didn't make me scoff and laugh.  Male Ryder has been pretty good.  I like how relaxed he sounds compared to Male Shep.  Liam and Cora are fine I guess, but when have the human companions ever been interesting.

I mean, let's face it...  Faces look like butt.  Yet everything else in the game looks amazing.  Armor, effects, environments...  It all looks pretty rad.  You get over a cringe curve after a while with the faces where you get used to it, though.

Hopping around and jetting like an insane person is actually really fun.  I've had no qualms with the movement so far, like others have.  Shooting feels a bit spongey, but I think that's cause I put the difficulty at hardcore.  I really wanna see what abilities I can open up.

I think my thing is that I don't expect 2001: A Space Oddesey when I play Mass Effect...  I expect goofy shit like Star Wars, Firefly, or old Star trek.  Getting SERIOUS Trek vibes with all the scanning.  I read somewhere that people were expecting some kind of Lovecraftian existential horror monsters with the Kett.  They aren't that AT ALL.  Empire Strikes Back music basically starts playing when they show up on screen.  It's classic, campy ass sci-fi. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But see, what you're missing from the video you posted is the body expression and movement.  Shepherd is leaning against some crates when he talks to Liara, and Liara's head isn't twitching, trying to focus on him like she's PROGRAMED to do.  She's facing forward because she knows Shepherd is there and can hear her.  Like a person would...

That one girl they show Ryder talking to seemed like she was trying to snap her neck to look at him.  And her eyes weren't even looking up at him, they were pointed towards space somewhere.  Thankfully the aliens seem to have some emotion to them, and that's probably because they're so outside the natural valley that it can work even with little animation.

Regardless if you think these look better than the original series, with games like The Witcher 3 having some of the most realistic looking faces in video games, it really is no excuse for a giant like EA not to compete with that.  I'm one of those people who believe that yeah, Poland set the bar THAT high, and you got to compete now.  Gameplay looks great, exploring looks great, RPG elements look great, these faces do not.  And it's a damn shame, because you know Witcher 3 and others have taken influence from the drama that ME brought to the table with its dialogue system.

This is really unacceptable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm trying to stay positive about the game, BUT JESUS THOSE FACIAL ANIMATIONS. They're so stiff too... It's like they're not even trying.

It really isn't ok to have characters looking that dead inside, especially since it's the crew conversations, where we're supposed to get the real characterization of each crew mate. I can understand facial animation taking a back seat for meaningless side quests, but what the fuck man... The original ME series had better facial animation than this. Where Shepherd gives a wry smile to Garrus talking about 'popping the heat sink,' Tali fidgeting nervously revealing her crush, Wrex smacking his hands together in a wicked blood thirsty smile. Thane crossing his fingers together in melancholy retrospect.

You got a lot more personality from their subtle movements and facial quicks, despite how dated it may look now.  I REALLY hope this is from a previous build, because this looks just plain bad.  I'd expect this kind of work from a Focus Interactive game, not Bioware. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really love the intro, because it shows the stuff that we're arguing about today is so distant and over with, but they still had lasting ramifications.  The ignorance to Global Warming is shown in the first two shots of the intro, where it shows the Arctic sea melting away, and the Statue of Liberty becoming engulfed in water.  I love when they show New York, and just have it surrounded by a gigantic sea wall.  They treat it with nonchalance, going, "Yeah, that's what is going to happen.  It's not relevant to these characters, but this WILL happen." </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Expanse!

It's on Sy-Fy, but it probably has the best budget out of all their programs.  The show is based on a series of books by James S.A. Corey.  The books aren't like Game of Thrones, but Sy-Fy is trying to make the show like a Sci-Fi version of it.

It takes place hundreds of years in the future, where generations have been born and have grown up in zero gravity or on space.  The factions are divided between three peoples...  Earthers, Martians and people who live in space, known as Belters.  The story revolves around a crew of an ice-hauler who stumble upon a huge, world-shaking conspiracy.  Give it a shot! </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, one of the things that isn't often mentioned about this game is that it's a perfect time sink.  Akin to games like Eurotruck or Elite: Dangerous, you never feel pressured to go anywhere with a story or sidequests.  You honestly can just play as much as you want, quit, start a new character, or play on the super nifty Azezel mode. (Hope I spelled that right.)

Azezel mode allows you to ghost jump when you die to either a squadmate or another random person on the map.  With each jump, I'd always craft little stories in my head as I played, giving motivation to my character's fleeting lives.

One arc involved the military.  I spawned as a commander of a patrol of three, and we set out on this long stretch of road.  We came upon a band of bandits that laid waste to us, having the height advantage of a bridge to mow us easily down.  One soldier was left, after struggling to kill the rest of the bandits off.  So, I decided to make him a bitter drunk mourning the loss of his squad.  Every bottle of Cossack's vodka I could find, I downed, storming into small bases of innocent STALKERS or other factions and killing them without mercy.

Surprisingly, luck was on my side, and my drunken soldier was finding himself continually winning with odds stacked against him.  He would charge into battle, hoping to die and join his comrades, only to find himself looking for vodka on the bodies of the dead.  Eventually, I found a military squad holed up inside a warehouse, under attack by swarming bandits and STALKERS.  I had stripped myself of all weapons at that point and was charging into battles with a knife.  That is where I finally met my death along the side of the warehouse.

BUT, I had added a couple of men to my squad.  And I warped to another soldier.  For some reason, the military really wanted to hold this warehouse deep in the zone, so I killed what bandits came, and guarded the warehouse.  I assigned myself body disposal detail and began dragging the corpses of the slain soldiers and bandits to a ditch.  Included in the heap, was my previous self, stripped of his vodka and left to rot amongst bandits and soldiers alike.

I let my character become enraged of what became of his men, of his unit, so I organized a force to attack the bandit base that resided nearby.  We would devastate this scourge to the zone.  BUT, thanks to that Dynamic factions mod, as I was in the base planning my surprise attack, the bandits and military declared a truce over the radio.  Just at they did, I came upon my first bandit.  We both pointed our weapons at each other, unsure of what to do, when we finally said, "Fuck the rules, these guys die." We laid waste to their base, with notifications that my standing within the Military was growing worse.  I was becoming reviled even by my own association.  I stood amongst the bodies, collected what I could, and moved on...

Until I was sniped by some bandit out in the wastes.

This is the kind of story that Racyevick is talking about, and my God does he nail it.  The moment to moment gameplay of CoC is really something to be seen.  Give it a try, seriously... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Airsoft abides by an honor system, so unless you're a huge dick, it's never really an issue when people are hit.  They just call it out.

Airsoft is also more realistic I guess?  I know there are some paintball guns that look real, but airsoft really has cornered that market. </TEXT>

If anything, it's established that Chuck resented how people liked and doted on Jimmy despite being a scamp, and that led him to pushing back against Jimmy's wishes to follow his brother into law.

Chuck is also right about how Jimmy is going to get people hurt, as he already did in Episode 2.  One of these days, the way Jimmy shrugs off corruption is going to fuck up everything...  His career, his relationship with Kim, and his friendships. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Call of Chernobyl is a mod for S.T.A.L.K.E.R Call of Pripyat: http://www.moddb.com/mods/call-of-chernobyl

After reading about CoC being the top mod of the year in 2016 for ModDB, I reinstalled Call of Pripyat to see what all of the fuss was about.  I was surprised to find a fun, immersive, and engaging time sink of a game that randomly spawns you in the Zone with whichever alliance you want, and then lets you off the leash.  

You basically decide how you want to live your life in the zone from that point...  I personally have been taking on assassination contracts from whomever will pay.  There's not much depth to it, and the story (if you wish to follow it) is light, but there's something about just wandering the Zone which really scratches an itch I've been missing that only the Stalker games seem to satisfy...  You get these moments of emergent story that can only happen with how the AI behaves and how you interact with its systems.

I've installed a couple other Quality of Life mods too, and it makes the game a lot better.  First off: http://www.moddb.com/mods/call-of-chernobyl/addons/original-weapon-renewal-3 

This mod reskins and changes all the weapons in the game, and it makes gunplay a lot more fun.  I haven't tried the Arsenal Addon yet, seeing as how I think it conflicts with OWR.

Seriously, if you've been missing STALKER like I have, this mod is worth checking out...  It combines all the areas from the three games into one, traversable open world separated by loading screens.  It makes me really wish for STALKER 2... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, so this is getting ridiculous...

I didn't like Rogue One that much either, but there seems to be a lot of venom coming from RLM that their attributing to 'rabid fanboys' and 'paid reviewers.'  Mike, Jay, Rich...  Seriously, not everyone who liked the movie is being paid off.  Saying things like 'Star Wars fans aren't true fans..." or whatever they were trying to imply in earlier videos is elitist and really immature.  I know this is 'satire' but they're sending a very clear message with it, and with the amount of content they're putting out, they're trying to make it seem like there's a fight that just isn't...  There...

And it's not even like Rogue One was horrible enough to justify all this.  They all kind of agreed it was ok, but now that they've been challenged it seems like they're jumping into the batch that say Rogue One was completely awful.  It's like the backlash is warping their opinions a bit.

In my opinion, the one video was enough.  I agreed with most of their points on the movie, and it doesn't bother me that others liked it more, but to get this worked up about it is just childish and bitter.  I've would have liked an ACTUAL podcast discussing other films. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I've argued about this, but the 'Holocaust' in a historical sense was distinctly the deaths of the 6 million jews, gypsies and homosexuals.  The Russian deaths were grouped into the general war crimes statistic of 'civilian deaths,' even though the Russian Civilian death count surpasses every other nation who participated in the war.

I think the reasoning of this is because the Russian death count is hard to measure...  There's no way of knowing how many of those were deaths by their own government.  I think that the 10 million or so Russian Civilians should be grouped in with the Jewish losses of the Holocaust, and they should bring the number up to the 16-20 million mark.  

Hitler's 'living space' plan was in part based around anti-semitism, so those people died as a result of the anti-jewish rhetoric of the Third Reich just as the Jewish populace of places like Germany and Poland. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It looked REALLY bad... And I know it's popular to rag on CGI, but this felt nearly as bad as the prequel's overuse of them. I thought we established with Superman Returns that, no matter how good technology is at the time, CGI use of an actor's face is destined to look bad years from now...

[Tarkin and Leia really took me out of the film. I really don't see why they couldn't have recasted Peter Cushing's character with someone else, like they did with Mon Mothma. Hell, Charles Dance (Tywin Lannister) would have been PERFECT as Tarkin, but they instead choose to go with this shitty Shrek tier CGI that is gonna make people laugh at this film years from now. If it looks bad NOW, it isn't going to look good later. Plus, I for one believe that using a dead actor's face without their living permission is a really low way to go... Disney should know better.
Overall, I found Rogue One to be a competent film, but held back by some really dumb choices and pacing problems...](#spoiler) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm glad the election is over so she can focus more on the issues and politics of this new administration.  I love watching Full Frontal, but at times she seemed to lean to hard into her pro-Hillary bias.  I am reminded of the ONE instance where Bernie shut down Hillary during a primary debate, when Bernie didn't let Hillary interrupt him, and Bee skewed it in such a way to make it look like Bernie was talking down to her.  Stuff like that was incredibly frustrating, because I do believe that Samantha Bee's show is fantastic and she's one of the best female comedians working today.

I also think ALL of these parody shows need to scale back on the 'man-on-the-street' interviews that they continually do to point out the stupidity of the Trump Supporter at the rally believing everything the man says.  It has such a mocking, arrogant tone at times, despite the opportunities for genuine comedy out of these responses.  The focus should be more on the man and his actions, not the people.  Grouping all Trump supporters into the people who go to rallies and yell OBAMA IS A MUSLIM is not representative of his base, and the people who don't believe the more extreme shite that spews out Trump's mouth feel as if these shows are targeting them as well.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's so weird seeing Fassbender and Cotillard in this.  They are in their prime of their acting career, and they have to know what a risk video game movies are.  Christ, they were in Macbeth only a year ago together, and that was something comparable yet wholly different from this in terms of tone.  

That scene of the buggy chase was actually pretty intense though, and the shots set in Spain look fantastically rich.  I'm super curious to see if this will be the video game movie to break the cycle.  It would be hilarious, seeing as how the Assassin's Creed franchise is associated with a yearly release cycle reminiscent of a product over art.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-11-23 04:29:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It is not often we see a new games media site with significant support appear.  Vice is a huge media company, and it seems that in its slowly building empire, it wants to divert resources into specific journalistic areas.  That's all great and all, but we're in the middle of this 'death of traditional games media' phase.  Many people now get their games information from Twitch streamers, youtube reviewers, or by general word of mouth.  In this transitional age of independent games journalism, continuous questions of integrity and streamer culture, can a site like Waypoint truly thrive?  Or is it doomed?

It has very prominent names behind it, like Giant Bomb vets Austin Walker and Patrick Klepek, but is that enough to raise the site to the heights of say a Polygon, Gamespot or IGN?  And are those names even relevant anymore?

I'd love to hear what you all think.

I personally love them and find myself on the edge of my seat with every attempt.  I don't even mind failure.  It's an immersive experience that the devs didn't have to put it, but still did.

On the other hand, it is very anti-consumer...  People who wanted to wait to buy the game when all 6 episodes released are SOL.  But...  I dunno, I'm just not that mad about it.  It's a weird, interesting idea within a format that makes sense. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm actually very apprehensive about this trailer.

I'm sick of reapers and big bads.  If I want another super human villain looking to destroy all life in the galaxy, I'll watch a Marvel movie or play the original Mass Effect Trilogy.  I've seen this before!  This is just a new Saren.  Is it going to be another retread of the old games?

The themes of this game should be more frontiersy, more about exploration, politics, interacting with races above or below your comprehension.  I think a little bit of existentialism is good, but not for the main quest...  The quest should be more personal.  About finding a home.  

Granted, this is just another vague trailer that the team has been releasing over and over, but I am kind of tuning out if this is what tone they want to go for. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was in Japan last month, and while I didn't run into Yakuza, I got to see how they affected a city like Osaka.

The most memorable experience was my friend driving through a district called Tobita Shinchi.  The area is a legal grey area where prostitution is practiced out in the open.  Prostitution is illegal in Japan, but here it was very in your face.  The way it was presented was disturbingly surreal.  We drove slowly through the small, sidewalk-street the Japanese have that work as alleys.  Every building had an open garage type door, with a girl sitting on a pillow and blasted with strong lights.  They had really strong makeup on, and were dressed from everything to a Cowgirl to a School Girl.  The moment you see them, they see you...  And their eyes are locked on yours as they smile and try to urge you to pay for their services.  Each girl is also flanked by an old woman, called a Mama-San who acts as the pimp.  I also noticed young guys posted up on each corner leading out of the area...  It was a weird and unsettling experience.

I also saw a large number of police suiting up for a raid.  Dozens upon Dozens of unarmed men were lining up on a crosswalk to start moving out to some unknown area.  My friend said that two organizations in Osaka were currently at war, but who knows how true that is.  It seems like in Osaka, the Yakuza influence is a lot more prevalent. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I very much disagree.  Good writing isn't lambasting the audience with your 'satire' (Which honestly hasn't been that funny since GTA 3) and then having your protagonist tell the audience what's wrong with what's going on in a matter reminiscent of a Shakespearean soliloquy.  

For example...  The torture scene in GTA V was really well done.  The brutality of Trevor's sadism contrasted with the sort of guess work the FIB use to spot the terrorist was fantastic commentary on the war on terror.  That is until Trevor decides to drive the victim to the airport, and spout off Houser's- I mean Trevor's rhetoric about how torture doesn't gain any real information.  I put my face in my hands during that...  They ruined a perfectly good scene that had a lot to say by continuing to beat the audience's head with the 'message'.  I'm not saying that what they're writing and setting up is bad...  It's just that they write to much, and it ruins what they have.  They turn good work into shit work.  The story between Michael, Trevor and Franklin was very compelling, emotional and believable, but there ALWAYS has to be Houser commentary in the background, and they sully any impact the original scribe has.

It's as if during a Godzilla movie, every character was going, "Hm, this whole situation with this monster is bad.  It reminds me of a sort of analogy for the dangers of Nuclear weapons."

As all writers will say...  SHOW DON'T TELL.  Dan Houser doesn't get that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not saying they have to force progressiveness into a time where progressiveness wasn't a priority, but to say 'There were no female outlaws/gunslingers' is just naive.  Plus, the majority of men were at home raising cattle.  Outlaws are the fringes of society, which means that all groups of people who feel like outsiders can flock to that group...  There are plenty of stories of female outlaws, black gangs, Mexican gangs, multi-cultural gangs, etc.  Plus this game is set in a fictional place, where countless people are gunned down in a matter of hours.  The most famous shoot out in all of Western History was the shootout at OK Coral.  Only like a few people died in that, but it's definitely not the hundreds Marston lays to waste in RDR.  It's not like Red Dead is a prime example of Historical Accuracy. </TEXT>

In fact, most of my friends seem to think they use the N-Word far too much, and it comes off as forced a lot of the time.

<TEXT> I believe that it'd be historically accurate for the time if this is indeed a gang in the wild west.  Wild West gangs were very diverse, and if the game really is one where you're switching between all 7 characters, then I think it would make sense that one or two of those wouldn't be white.  Didn't Dutch ally himself with a Native American gang in the mountains anyway?  Plus, I just feel as if that Rockstar needs to put a female playable character in their game...  It's been decades, and we have had one dude after another.  I'm not saying the lead HAS to be a woman, but if you're going to do a game with 7 characters, then why can't one be a lady?  

Granted, these 7 men may have nothing to do with the plot.  Then I'll look silly, but ATM I'm fine with bringing this up as a discussion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I seriously hope it isn't the Housers writing again...  I am convinced they have no idea how to write in a subtle fashion, and let their political commentary get in the way of telling good stories.  GTA V was really bad about this.  I was invested in the weird dynamic between Trevor, Michael and Franklin, and how Michael's past betrayal influenced that, but a good portion of the game was dedicated to this GOD AWFUL Agency vs Agency plot that just pulled me right out of the story...  Shit, even Red Dead 1 had Marston break off from good story telling to rant about the federal government.

Rockstar is amazing at crafting deep, immersive worlds, atmosphere, and reliable gameplay...  But they can't write a game worth a damn.  Hire some new writers...  Please...

Edit - They also ruined Max Payne. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, for the last few weeks, I've been having an issue when I go into downtown Boston. Before when I had this issue, I had about 120 mods installed. The game worked alright, until I got towards Diamond City. Then it seemed the game was collapsing piece by piece. Long, crash-worthy freezes, CTD, mipmaps never going back to high res, corrupt saves.

I also had this installed: http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/332/?

It was originally set to 10,000 Ram Usage, seeing as how I have 4 GB VRAM and 16 GB of RAM I didn't think of it as an issue. But once I get into Boston, I have this problem where mipmaps go low res and stay that way. They never rise back to high res, even when reloading the game.

I have tried numerous options to try and get this game working with mods, but I still have this issue with a fresh install and very few mods installed. And in just starting a new game, I have LOOONG freezes and mipmaps glitching out right as I leave Sanctuary. This is making the game unplayable, and I have no idea how to fix this issue. Can someone please help me?

I'd appreciate it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Battlefield has NEVER had good Campaigns, but this seems to be making all the right decisions when it comes to tone and storytelling.

I'm getting a very serious anti-war vibe for all the media they've released around the Campaign.  From this clip, to the intro mission where you are consistently dying to what seems like a fruitless mission, to the trailer which had a soaring Oscar-Bait tone you'd see in films like Atonement or similar.  I REALLY want this to do something cool and different, and with stuff like this, it seems like Battlefield 1 is on the right track.

I mean...  Could you have EVER seen a game like Battlefield honoring the carrier pigeons who at times saved hundreds to thousands of lives?  This is different.  And I hope it continues to surprise me.

By the way, [this is a better video where the player isn't being a twat.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLW4k0a2G8A) </TEXT>

Now they have to step it up, with Cyberpunk being their main future competition. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like Fallout 4 was finally the straw that broke the camel's back.  NO ONE, and I mean, NO ONE liked the new dialog system.  I remember 'HATE NEWSPAPERS' and 'SARCASTIC' being mocked before the game even came out.  I think the lukewarm reaction fallout 4 got critically was a wakeup call for a lot of people creatively at Bethesda.  It always seems like they take two steps forward and then three back...  So hopefully this will create some creative reflecting about what they're doing wrong.  I know one thing for sure...  People are not going to tolerate a usual broken Bethesda game ever again...

Settlement Building, Weapon and Armor Modification, better shooting, and thought-out companions were great steps forward, but then they yanked out RPG elements, introduce a shitty dialog system, and streamlined a lot of stuff that didn't need to be.  It blows my mind that they didn't look at what Obsidian did with New Vegas and go, "Oh, we're fucking morons.  We need to ADD stuff, not take away." 

Perhaps its just trying to get the greater market into Fallout.  New Vegas was a great game, but I feel like it's for a more niche audience than the main-line Fallout games. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, but they want to.  They're just afraid to take that leap.

Look at the launch trailer for Fallout, and tell me what kind of tone you get from it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5aJfebzkrM

In fact, the whole reason they introduced a new voiced protagonist was to create more drama for the player.  They just didn't go far enough.  Fallout 4 was stuck tonally, like a lot of games, between the serious and the silly.  Grand Theft Auto IV suffered from this too.  They need to be able to tell a compelling story with enough going on that silly elements won't detract from it.  Witcher 3 is a great example of doing this right...  Going partying with a ghost inhabiting your body is SUPER silly, but the Witcher 3 is smart enough to still tell a compelling story even within that idea. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gopher is one of my favorite Youtube Personalities.  His mod videos are great, and he focuses on the mods that make Fallout or Skyrim more Immersive.

He has a great point about playing a vault dweller over someone who is currently in the wasteland, in that it has a great opportunity to tell a fish out of water story.  Someone who has never played Fallout can jump into any of the games and be as naive as the main character.

Unfortunately, I feel as if Bethesda squandered the opportunity of Fallout 4's protagonist.  They could have told a really heartbreaking, dramatic story about a man/woman out of time, the loss of their spouse, and how the world has changed so much.  Instead it was forced into this schlocky tone where your protagonist was too busy dressing like a bear and taunting robots into suicide to go look for his son.  

I think that's why the casual approach to main quests works so well in New Vegas.  Yeah, you are out for revenge, but you don't ever feel rushed.  Fallout needs to encourage exploration, and you feel guilty in 4 when you're exploring because your son could be in danger. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hm, so lots to unpack here:

1. The perspective change between soldiers is interesting.  This harkens back to the old school, jumping between soldiers of the Battlefield 2 Console game.  Now, it felt like this was an aesthetic choice for the beginning of the game rather than actual gameplay.  It seemed to show the futility of it all, and how frequent the loss of life was...  I'm curious about how a video game that glorifies war is going to take an anti-war stance, but I'm open to seeing what they can do.

2. Whelp...  That sure is a lot of automatic weaponry for a game that is set in a bolt-action time.  I was glad to see a bolt-action rifle during one of the instances, but this seems like it's definitely going to take more liberties with the time frame.  Though, this makes it kind of weird when they have all these bumps at the beginning going, "This game is set 100 years ago..." 

K...

3. I couldn't really tell seeing as how every player and piece of the environment was a dirty grey, but it looked as if all the player characters were on the British side.  I was hoping it would bounce around more, but this is just the first mission.

4. I saw noticeable framerate drops during that play through...  I hope that isn't representative of the final release, but seeing as how it seems they are pushing the power of consoles as hard as they can go in this, I wouldn't be surprised.  Let's hope there's a day one patch or something along those lines.

5. It felt like, while that level seemed to try and look open-ended, the camera was transporting to each soldier in their specific zones.  I'm wondering if it'll ever open up like one of the multiplayer maps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would say to play it vanilla and find specific things that bother you about the game.  If they bother you enough, then start seeking out mods.

For example, do you, like many people, hate the dialog system?  There's a mod to fix that and to find out what you are exactly saying when you press, 'Sarcastic.'

Or what if you spend a LOT of time in the settlement builder?  There's some mods to increase the budget you can place in a area, to extend power lines, to allow you to place things anywhere, or to add other simple fixes that make building more enjoyable.

What if you really LOVE survival mode, but hate how the saving system works?  There is a mod for that too.  But I'd say before you go crazy installing body mods, weapon mods, or mods that give you pet Deathclaws...  You should find the simple things that have easy fixes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like many people, I use my companions as pack mules for the junk and extra equipment I need to carry.  I was thinking of a way to save time, and I wondered if there was a mod that spurred companions to drop off their junk into the main workbench as soon as they entered the settlement.  They wouldn't have to even approach the bench, there could just be a notification that your companion has dropped off his/her junk into the main bench.

I was also wondering if anyone could make a more immersive mod to find your companions that didn't involve the console...  Like a radio where you can call them in to meet you somewhere, or to check in and give their general location in the form of a quest.  I've lost DogMeat again, and I hate using the console for anything because it takes me out of the experience.

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been installing a bunch of mods on my fresh install, and I have been loading up weapon mods willy nilly without really thinking about it.

I have the DOOM Merged Set, Millenia's new gun, a bunch of the top files on the Nexus, and so on...  Thing is, I wonder if I'm cheapening the Fallout atmosphere by installing all these modern guns.

My rationale is that Fallout: New Vegas had a modern M4 in its vanilla roster, so all other modern guns can technically be canon too...

http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Assault_carbine

I also wonder about balancing these mods.  I have issues where a lot of Raiders will only be carrying one mod weapon that I've installed (The M14) and I'm wondering if there's a way to make that more diverse. </TEXT>

When the idea that selling your vacations is considered normal business behavior, you know something is wrong.

You're expected to have a job 6 months out of college in Japan, or you are already a disappointment.

The work ethic is definitely something to be admired in Japan, but it seems like, to me, that the cost is a unhappy populace.  It's why you are seeing birthrates declining, less marriages...  Go on a subway train at 8 AM on a weekday in Japan, and tell me that these people look happy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey all,

I was wondering what weird or interesting dinner places, besides Robot Restaurant, are cool to see in Tokyo?  I have been wanting to see Robot Restaurant, but I'm hearing that it's pricey, as well as crowded due to growing popularity with tourists.  Plus I heard they toned it down a bit, which sounds like it isn't what I have been seeing in the videos...

What are some cool, weird restaurants or clubs that we can visit to really experience the weirder side of Tokyo? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It blows my mind how effective 9/11 was in creating a spiral of fear in this country.  In the grand scale of things, we only lost three thousand people...  More people die from Natural Disasters, car wrecks, or other such everyday hazards every day, but those three thousand changed the world as we know it.  It was tragic, but I am saddened that the terrorists pretty much succeeded in what they were trying to do.  And it has generated this cycle of violence that has gotten completely out of control in the middle east... </TEXT>

<TITLE> Sumo Wrestling Tournament questions! </TITLE>

<TEXT> Hey guys,

So, I don't know if you all know, but there is a Sumo Wrestling Tournament going on from September 11th onwards.  Besides that, I know next to nothing about it!  But I'm going to be in Japan during that time, and I'd love to be able to catch a match.

So, my questions are:

1. Do we have to reserve seating for a match?  And if so, what site?

2. How much does it cost?  I got the impression that there are three tiers of seating, each varying in price.

3. Anyone wanna go see it together? :) My friend and I are interested, but it may be cool to get a small group together to see a match. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going to Japan in September, and I'm going to be spending a day or two in Osaka, visiting a friend and exploring a bit...  Thing is, I'm going on the trip with another friend, and he has no interest in seeing Osaka.  

It's fine!  We don't care about being glued to the hip or anything, but he's more interested in Japan at the geeky/weird angle.  He wants to see all the arcades, maid cafes and other things in Tokyo.  So, I was wondering...  What is there to do in Osaka that may satiate his desire for weird, geeky stuff?  Is there something I could use to try and convince him to come along? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It still hurts.  I need a new series. ;_;

There's something about this show and how its characters view children that is just unsettling like anything I have ever watched.  The show's tone can be so nihilist with its complete hatred towards children and what they represent to the growing population.  Their lives are just thrown away at numerous moments throughout the two series run.  I think it's because the upbeat, yet disturbing, music and the vibrant splashy color offsets all the ultra violence presented on screen.  

Game of Thrones can show as many kids and innocent people being hacked up by swords as it wants, but nothing unsettles me the way Utopia does. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've noticed that he tends to judge an actor's performance by their off-screen activities.  His dismissiveness of K Stew was one element, but what really made me realize it was his review of Gone Girl, how he dedicated like five minutes of his review making fun of Tyler Perry and the movies he makes.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a huge fan of Tyler Perry either, but his performance in the film was actually really good.  He personified that charming television personality with the knowings of how the game worked underneath...  It worked really well.  But in Adam's review, it's like, "Hey, Tyler Perry is shit right?  How weird was it that he was in this movie?  Let me ramble about that for a bit." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been thinking about this a lot lately.  FFG is missing a great opportunity of people who want to play as Imperial or Evil characters.  Right now, it seems like people have to work it our narratively if they want to play as the bad guys, but I would love some mechanics added to allow for Evil Campaign plays!

There's a lot that could be added!  Players could play as Imperial Double Agents, perhaps a specialized Stormtrooper Squad made famous in the most recent comics, Commanders of ISDs, Sith Apprentices, Inquisitors...  I think there's a lot of possibility here. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Doing Mount Fuji and Aoikgahara Forest in two days. Looking for some information. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-01 16:14:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys,

So, a friend and I are planning to climb Mt. Fuji and explore the infamous Aokigahara Forest in two days on our two week vacation.  Our vacation is planned for early September, so we know it's gonna be cold.  We have a few questions in relation to getting there, getting to Aokigahara and then getting back.

1. The schedule for the buses at Shinjuku Station in Tokyo were very vague.  I think we're under the impression that you take a bus as early as 9:30, and then get to 5th Station.  But I've seen videos, like Abroad in Japan, that seem to show buses taking off at a later time.  Could we get clarification on that by any specific link?  

2. We reserved two spaces at the Mountain Hut at 3,400 meters, but I've just learned how expensive it is and we may choose to forego that option.  If so, what options do we have besides sleeping outside?  Are there little spaces to hang out, eat, drink, and maybe not freeze to death?

3. After we do the mountain, we want to climb down and make a trip to Aokigahara Forest since we are in the area.  Now, the impression we got is that we make our way back to Kawaguchiko station, which we assume the buses go back from the station we climb down at, and then take something called a 'Retro Bus' towards a Station by a bat cave.  Can we take the Retro Bus back?  Has anyone done this as well, and what did you do similar?

4. And just to clarify, we are under the impression that taking a train to Hiroshima, using the JR pass, from Kawaguchiko Station is impossible.  It seemed to us that it'd cost less just to take the bus back to Tokyo and start on the train from there, but we wanted to clarify.

Thanks for any help, and I'd appreciate any tips for exploring these two parts of the Fuji area. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've frankly just started it, but it seems like their focus is more on Murderers.  The last two episodes I listened to were some of the most recent releases, and one was about two different cases of women killing their family.  That was very disturbing, because they played the panicked phone calls of the family begging not to be killed.  The other was a story about a woman in Japan named Junko Futura.  If you've read American Psycho, that's what you're in for with her story.

It's audio murder porn basically.  Like what you'd see on TV with Deadly Women or something similar... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really want to like Pokemon Go.  Hell, I'm the type of person who would benefit most from it!  I walk 5-6 miles a day for work, and sometimes podcasts or audiobooks just don't do it...  But even with my long walks, Pokemon Go is a broken catastrophe.  I distinctly remember walking home, just TRYING to play this game, and having it freeze up or crash with every attempt to catch a Pokemon or take a gym.  And to add insult to injury, it works for the ratatas and pidgys, but when a rare pokemon pops up...  THAT'S when it freezes.  It seriously turned me off to the whole experience, and I still get very frustrated, just giving it one more go...  Only to have the same problems consistently halt my progress.  

I think I hate this game.  Not what it represents, or the technology it's pushing forward.  All of that sounds great and new and interesting!  But the unintentional negative feedback loop attributed to how mind-numbingly broken this game just makes the whole affair seem fruitless and pointless.  Play Ingress instead.

If you're really wondering if you should get this game, I highly recommend waiting.  My problems have seriously skewed my opinion of the game, and now I am biased against it.  If you wait 6 months, you might get a betterb experience!  But I doubt I am going to be playing this game anytime soon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you want to read a tragic story, read this woman's diary entries:

Shanina's personal life was thwarted by war. On 10 October 1944, she wrote in her diary, "I can't accept that Misha Panarin doesn't live anymore. What a good guy! [He] has been killed ... He loved me, I know, and I him ... My heart is heavy, I'm twenty, but I have no close [male] friend". In November 1944, Shanina wrote that she "is flogging into her head that [she] loves" a man named Nikolai, although he "doesn't shine in upbringing and education". In the same entry she wrote that she did not think about marriage because "it's not the time now". She later wrote that she "had it out" with Nikolai and "wrote him a note in the sense of 'but I'm given to the one and will love no other one'". Ultimately in her last diary record, filled with sombre tones, Shanina wrote that she "cannot find a solace" now and is "of no use to anyone". </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Age: 27

Sex: Male

Weight: 260 lbs

Height: 6'1

Race: White

Duration: A few years now...

Location: Night time, when I'm trying to sleep in my bed.

Existing Issues: Allergies, frequent urination at times...

Current Medications: Vitamins I take in the morning.

Will provide a pic if necessary.

Can anyone tell me what this is? It usually happens when I am in bed, unable to sleep. I usually sleep on my side, and I'll sometimes open my eyes to the white walls to the left or right of me.

When I do, I'll see a shadow of a large spider. It looks like a tarantula, but the legs are sharp like a black widow. It used to make me jump, but now I've gotten so used to it I just watch them for the few seconds they exist before they disappear.  It's usually only one Spider, directly in the center of my vision.

The hallucinations only last a few seconds. It feels like the same sensation you get when you press on your closed eyes and see lights. I know they aren't real, so I feel like they aren't effecting me psychologically. But it's so weird that I was wondering if there was a name for this weird thing that happens? </TEXT>

I was thinking of how awesome a HITMAN game would be with this format.  You walk around a GPS representation of your surroundings, find objects in the world like you do with random pokemon.  You can kill targets with the camera like you would the AR part of Pokemon Go, or snipe other Hitmen who are playing the game, based on their google picture.  

Strongholds/Safe Houses can work as the Gyms, and people can start claiming territory like they would a Mafia game or something.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ruined is a strong word, bit I remember one of the final shots of Unbreakable really pissed me off.  The shot I'm referring to is when David is walking away from Mr. Glass after discovering it was him who was responsible for numerous terrorist attacks, including the train crash David was a part of...  As he's walking away, the picture freeze frames and details the epilogue as following: 

"David Dunn led authrorites to Limited Edition where evidence of three acts of terrorism was found."

"Elijah Price is now in an institution for the criminally insane."

These two shots, one after the other, nearly ruined the entire film for me.  They were so out of place and unneeded.  They implied that the events of the film actually happened...  I know M. Night gets a lot of shit for his newer releases, but these added shots completely baffle me.  How could he think adding them was a good idea?

Another example if my friend who claims he is taken out of the experience of Star Wars by the Stormtrooper who bumps his head on the raising door in A New Hope, but I find that one a bit over doing it...

I get what it was, I understand how this was a film that pioneered modern surrealism in film, and how it elevated David Lynch to a director to absolutely care about and watch, and how it was a fantastically done with prosthetics and filming, and how the tone and atmosphere is completely drenched in a horrific vibe that unnerves you and makes you eye everything with your own interpretation...

But that doesn't stop it from being one of the most miserable 88 Minutes of my life.  I will never watch this movie again. </TEXT>

That said, he has the same issues with GTA V.  For an open world game, none of the missions are free form.  I think in one of his 'games that should bang' series, he stated he wished for the mission structure of MGSV over what GTA V offers, which I agree with. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, after all these experimental reveals...  My assumption is that this is a Alternate History telling of World War 1.  My guess is that the game is going to take place in 1919 and 1920, in a timeline where Germany didn't surrender.  It makes much more sense with all the experimental weaponry and piece by piece armor additions that characters seem to be scavenging for.

My problem is with some of the things the narrator mentioned, and also how Horses being used in other purposes rather than pulling around Artillery.  Horses were used in battle in the early stages of World War 1, got completely and utterly massacred, and then retired all together.

I really want to get a sense of the 'lore' behind this game.  Otherwise, it looks like they shoved all these automatic weapons into WW1 to appease the CoD kiddies and modern warfare fans who couldn't think of using a bolt-action rifle as a main assault gun. </TEXT>

Honestly, I don't have that reaction when people tell me they don't watch it.  Hell, after season 5 I would have said, "Good." Season 5 was a train wreck filled with anthrax.  Season 6 has mostly kicked ass though.  That finale was probably the best episode of the series, IMO.  But when people say they don't watch it, I just go, "Ok." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm glad Zootopia went the way it did.  This scene, powerful as it is, is waaay too on the nose, and it simplifies the issue to one extreme point of view.

The way they presented it in the movie was excellent.  The 'racism' of other species is a multifaceted problem, and you lean one way with Judy's story only for Nick's backstory to swing you another.  It plays with your emotions, and shows that people's perceptions of each other come from places of history, profiling, economics, etc...  

And to be fair, the 'naizism' of the collars is pretty heavy for a kids movie geared towards Americans.  Racial issues today are more reflected of the Civil Rights movement to most modern Americans, so I'm glad the movie steered more towards a multi-layered setting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a show based on a movie series where a frog monster teaches a punk kid to lift a starship out of a swamp while he talks to the ghost of his old mentor.  Where did this sudden suspension of disbelief of Star Wars comes from?  Star Wars has always been schlocky, fun, ridiculous pulp.  I don't see how Darth Maul creating spider-legs from sheer hatred takes you out of the experience...

Besides, what they do with his character in the series is miles ahead of what they did with him in the movie.  Everyone has this Boba Fett fascination with Maul, and he was a nothing character who flipped around like an idiot and died.  And now, he's in these shows, with more character development, depth and personality than Lucas could EVER attempt to imagine, and people hate it.  I can almost say that I enjoyed the Season 2 Finale of Rebels more than TFA. 

I'm sorry to be so passionate about this, but this is really starting to piss me off.  The Clone Wars has single-handedly repaired irreversible damage done to the Star Wars franchise.  I know, everyone's opinion is subjective...  But the way you dismiss it over trivial shit, with a lot of others, bugs the hell out of me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, granted I'l give you that...  It is interesting to see those other nations featured.  But even still, looking at the tweet you posted...  People are already annoyed that both France and Russia are not featured.

It's great if they want to focus on the smaller empires, but the name of the game is Battlefield...  Battlefield is well known for featuring starring nations of huge conflicts, and you'd actually be surprised how much the USSR is left in.  Most CoD games have them included, and Battlefield 1942 included them as well.  Because those games recognize the importance of their nation to the war.  Hell, 1942 even included Canada.  

It just seems like a disservice to have a game set around one of the biggest conflicts in modern history, and leave out a HUGE chunk to be released as DLC.  If I was controlling the game, I'd say to keep France and Russia in the main game, and deal out the smaller nations in DLC.  I'm not saying that their nations didn't contribute, but World War 1 was a conflict driven by the larger powers, not the smaller ones.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it bugs me because it's stating with its content that France wasn't important enough to be in the main game, when France was one of the major three players in the war.  

If I, hypothetically, was a French gamer, and I bought this game thinking that my country would be represented due to HOW IMPORTANT it was to the conflict, only to see the U.S. take credit for it, I think I'd be a little pissed.  Oh, and I'd have to BUY my country's DLC to play it?  Yeah, fuck that and fuck EA.

It'd be like stripping the USSR from a WW2 game.  You just don't do it...  I know most Americans are of the ignorant opinion that the French are cowards, lost the wars, etc.  But they were vital in World War 1, and to see their faction stripped away to be sold as some after-market DLC later is what offends me. </TEXT>

Like with the big overarching reviews of stuff like Cyberbully, but he gets too focused in the nitty details which can ruin a whole film for him.  He also has this annoying tendency to repeat popular sentiments about actors.  I remember him going on this rant about  Tyler Perry despite his performance being quite good in Gone Girl.  I feel that he's not a good film reviewer.  A film reviewer should be examining the themes, story and characters of a film.  Not how a particular sound made the rest of the film weird... </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is completely fair.  He doesn't have to pry into his childhood friend's sex life on Facebook, but he does.  He doesn't have to pry into the drug trafficking business of his roommate's boyfriend, but he does.  He doesn't have to go and find out that his psychiatrist is into anal or not, but he does.  Yes, he may feel that this sense of justice-fueled invasiveness is a part of his problem, but it is still HIS problem.  I'm not saying I dislike Elliot.  He's a very flawed and compelling character, but to say, 'It's not his fault he invades other people's privacies.' Is incredibly naive.  He has the ability to change his circumstances, embrace his friends, leave the hacking side behind, but he doesn't...  Partly because of the ghost of his father following him around, but also because he has this overwhelming sense of self-worth and value to himself and his cause. </TEXT>

<TEXT> UGH, NO.  That's not what schizophrenia is...  Elliot has Dissociative Personality Disorder, or some kind of fictional version of it.  And I know that he doesn't have Autism, seeing as how my brother has Autism...  Part of the reason that Elliot is so disconnected from people is because he has forced himself into that hole.  The episode where he decides to be normal and go to parties is evidence of this.  If he were autistic, he wouldn't be able to turn it off like he does.  If Elliot were autistic, he would have shown signs as a child, WHICH HE DOESN'T.  Part of his problems revolve around a traumatic element of his childhood, his father dying and his mother being abusive.  YOU DON'T CATCH AUTISM, that's not how it works.  Elliot has some form of PTSD, or has experienced a traumatic past, and that influences how he is now.

Stop watching Fight Club and thinking that's a academic look into schizophrenia.  It's not.  Schizophrenia is completely different. </TEXT>

He spies on all of his friends, he has no idea how to initiate social cues or how to act in social situations, he has a paranoid delusion that there are people consistently after him, he has a skewed idea of justice that applies to his own biased set of morals, he is currently losing his fucking mind, his body language is a complete mess...

I mean, come on man, the dude is off kilter...  I would have said he is psychotic as well, seeing as how he has a double personality WITH HIS DEAD FATHER.  How did you not pick up on this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love this video.

It's hard not to feel the weight of the damage wrought to the Soviet Union.  Most Americans are of this jingoistic mentality that we won the war, that France was a bunch of cowards, etc...

No.  In the European theater, we were basically the clean up crew.  World War 2 was a Russian and German war, and it bugs the hell out of me that people don't realize that...  

But the way the video creator shows the numbers, how Russian deaths tower over all the others, just hits the nail in the coffin.  I'd say I'm more pessimistic about 'Long Peace' than the creator is.  The fact that more people were killed during World War 2, which wasn't that long ago, then any other war in history just tells me that we're still violent cavemen.  Our technology may be better, and we may have convinced ourselves that we're beyond the mentality of the evils of World War 2, but we aren't.  At all.  Just look at the political climate of the U.S. Election, or Russia's more recent invasion of Ukraine.  I feel as if another huge conflict is coming...  And it'll probably be more devastating than World War 2. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, the character development carries on into the cantina scene.  The majority of that scene is nothing but character development.  We get a sense that Finn is too scared to take on the First Order, that Han is willing to help Rey into a new world, that Rey is considering staying away from Jakku and taking Han's job offer, that Rey discovers more about herself through her Jedi Visions...

Am I crazy, or is there a LOT more going on in TFA than ANH?  For one thing, ANH was written without the idea of sequels coming afterwards.  That's why the characters are so cookie cutter, despite being wonderfully written.  TFA has hints of things to come, so there's a lot of speculation and hidden depth to all of the characters. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, not a joke.  I think there are more character moments in TFA then there were in ANH.  And one thing they do, which is pretty unheard of in a Star Wars film, is let the characters just do things in silence.  Finn realizes he's not a killer as he fumbles around the village, the blood streaks across his helmet speaking volumes over what he could express in his war horrors, Rey spends like a whole five minutes exploring derelict Imperial ships for parts and buying food.  The majority of which is in silence.  We get an idea that Finn is conflicted about his role in the New Order and that Rey is bored of her life as a scavenger.  All without much dialogue uttered!  The only scene in ANH that kind of reflects on that is when Luke is looking at the two suns.  That's his 'call to adventure' so to speak.  Like I said, ANH is the most BASIC retelling of the hero's tale. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with you completely.

People forget that A New Hope is the most BASIC retelling of the hero's tale.  I remember people saying that the pacing of The Force Awakens moved by at such a fast speed, when we get the same kind of pace in A New Hope.  We only get a few moments in the entire film of A New Hope for just honest character development...  When Obi-Wan is telling Luke about his Father, and when Obi-Wan, Luke, Han and Chewie are training on the Falcon while it's in Hyperspace.  That's it...  The rest is just action or dialogue relating to the next action set piece.

I love Tony Zhou, and I think he's one of the most influential and important voices in film right now, but yeah...  He's a bit more biased here.

Not by catastrophic nuclear war of course, but perhaps a stop to reproduction world wide.

An impossible solution, but the growing environmental problems on this earth outside of Nuclear war is due to having too many God Damned people on our planet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Stannis burning his daughter is actually very out of character.  The last we see him in the books, he states that A. That there will be no more burnings.  and B. That he will put Shireen on the Iron Throne.  Don't even get me started on the 20 men thing...  Ugh...

And Sansa...  She has been through her 'little girl' arc already.  It was time for her to start bucking up and making some decisions for herself- Oh, no we have to have her get raped and rescued.  Ok.  Despite being a chilling and disturbing scene, Sansa being the recipient of the abuse just completely derails her character.  I'm glad she's being more headstrong now, but what they did to her character before was terrible.

How is Selmy getting killed a bad decision?  Really?  First off, both the actor and the editor of the books HATED that, seeing as how there were important parts where he is involved.  Plus, having him killed by a bunch of rich snobs with little to no combat experience, when he is the best fighter in the land?  THAT SHIT MAKES NO SENSE.  

Yara's story and the Kingsmoot were some of my fan favorites from the book, and having them stripped from the overall context of the story annoyed the hell out of me.  And I can just feel that Euron is going to build a whole fleet of ships in a matter of a couple of episodes, when this story could have been placed in season 5 and Euron have his ships ready NOW.  

The Faith Militant should not have power at all.  The moment the kidnapped The Queen and the Queen's wife, they should have all been killed.  The idea that it's still going is completely stupid and inconceivable.  If some 99% 'Will of the People' group kidnapped Obama's Mother and Wife today, you'd bet your ass they wouldn't be living tomorrow.  I don't care how riotous the citizens are, the Lannisters (Kevan especially) would NEVER allow that to happen.  The only reason it happens in the books is because Kevan hates Cersei, and thinks that the Faith's grip on her will do her some good.  Tommen is a child so he doesn't care.  It's supposed to be a big changing moment for Cersei, where she gains a bit of humility...  But in the show she's still as cold as she ever was. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sorry, but I seriously thought Season 5 was bad television.  Stannis making stupid decisions, the butchering of Sansa's character, Sand Snakes, the Faith Militant having ANY power at all and that making NO SENSE, cutting out Bran and Yara completely from the season, Selmy being killed...  There were a series of baffling and stupid storytelling decisions made during that season that poisoned the entirety of it.  If not for Dany's Dragon scene, Hardhome, and good Arya stuff, I may have dropped the show. </TEXT>

So, I currently live in Buckhead, and I commute to work most days.  It's 2.5 miles to get there, so I usually just walk to work.  Though I'll probably be moving to Midtown at some point this year, and I'd like to keep up with the physical activity.  It seems like a bike would be best to do that.

I'm looking for a bike that's not too professional, something simple...  It seems like Fixed Gear bikes are what appeal to me those most right now.  I like the look of the Pure Fix bikes, but I also hear a lot of trash being talked about them.  I'd like to sift through the white noise and get a genuine bike recommendation if possible.

Thanks, I appreciate any feedback. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Ran my first game this weekend! Our group assassinated Jar Jar Binks. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-18 22:45:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, I'm still learning, but I got a group of five together to play this past weekend.  My story revolved around a military blockade that was hovering over Coruscant due to a bombing at the Imperial Palace.  My players were contracted by the Empire to investigate the bombing, seeing as how the Empire was stretched across the galaxy looking for Rebels post-Death Star I destruction. 

Part of the story involved my miscreants, who were pushed to the fringe by how restricted everything is in Coruscant, going to an Imperial Ball.  The ball was celebrating the new graduates of the Imperial Academy, much like a scene in Lost Stars.  They were outfitted with uniforms, and had to somehow blend in despite being all weird aliens and a droid.

I wanted to have each player run a charm check, and that determined who they danced with.  One player rolled good, so he danced with Mara Jade.  After they stopped dancing, they went about to the food.  I had hoped that a player would roll bad in an attempt to dance, so that they could be forced to dance with Jar Jar.  But they decided to hover at the bar.  So, I introduced Jar Jar there, having him approach a 4'3 Gungan player, Dani DaVoorti, a character with a Build like: Not Attractive and Eyes: Dead.  Dani was so greasy, that when Jar Jar tried to pull him to the dance floor, Jar Jar couldn't take him with him. (A Brawn check created that.)

So, with Jar Jar making a fool, I introduced a man who handed off a contract to kill Jar Jar, an address given on the data pad. Saying something along the lines of, "Jar Jar is an embarrassment...  It would be great if he just, disappeared."

I had planned out a whole scenario at Jar Jar's apartment, but Dani decided he needed to die as soon as possible and went about circumventing that.  I had forgotten, but Dani had bought a bunch of poison when he created his character, and wanted to use it on Jar Jar's punch.  I rolled with it, going, "OOOH, MESA NOT FEELS SOSA GOOD" Or whatever he says...  And the group escorted sick Jar Jar to the bathroom.  There, the group tried to murder him in the toilet, but kept failing, and Jar Jar began to panic.  I think I faintly remember  character failing to punch the back of Jar Jar's head twice.  It seriously went about 2 rounds of turns before our Zabrak, walked into the bathroom (She was guarding the door.) And then blew his head off with a rifle.  It was a hilarious, weird, unscripted moment that I'm glad I figured out...

Now I just have to figure out what to do next session. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm running a game next week, and I want to make sure I'm prepared.  So, I was wondering if any GM's on here could give me an example of their stories, and how much preparation I should actually have.  At this moment, I have the opening and call to adventure pretty much set to go...  

This first game is going to take place in Coruscant under an Imperial blockade.  I want to give the players freedom in a somewhat controlled environment, because I'm still in the process of learning vehicle rules.  I'm trying to anticipate what my players will want to do, so I'm jotting down a few locations and what could happen at them.

I'd appreciate any advice or possible examples.  Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Throughout the Television program, Lassie is seen having a uncharactistic amount of reason and deduction for a dog.  So much so that she at times seems super intelligent, even picking up on situations that the humans around her can't understand.  She's able to deduce what's about to happen from humans talking to each other, or about what they have planned if they're villains, or if something/thing is in danger.  Honestly, I think she can just understand English at times.  She feels guilt when she realizes she has done something wrong, and is able to understand what her owners are saying to her at times.  She also has the ability to communicate with other animal species through whines and barks.  I would think that any animal would be intimidated by a dog barking at them, no matter the context.  But Lassie seems to have this overwhelming power to calm them and interact with them in a way that seems unnatural.  Usually, these animals start trusting Lassie after a few nondescript barks towards their direction.  My theory is that she's speaking with them telepathically.  It would also explain why, almost comically, the humans seem to be able to pick up on what she's saying by her barks, "What's that Lassie?  Timmy's in the well?" Despite the obvious trope, it has foundations in reality of how Lassie communicates in the series.  I believe that those she affects telepathically don't even realize that's what she's doing.

There's also the supposed age of the dog.  The Lassie TV program ran from 1954-71, with it being set during the modern times of the respective era.  They have replaced the dog actor numerous times, but the assumption is that Lassie is the same dog in the canon of the show.  Lassie would have been an old, withering dog by the time of the 70s, unable to do the grand adventuring the dog was known for.  She also spent time with a number of different owners, such as The Martin Family, The Millers, and the Forest Service.  My theory is that Lassie switched her supposed 'owners' every few years to throw off the scent that she wasn't aging like a normal dog would.  Towards the end of the series, she has decided to go at it alone, possibly because she realized human attachments were too painful to keep up with.  The alien creature inside her grew too close to the humans, and felt detachment was a better solution.

If you take in the run of The New Lassie as canon as well, then her age extends well into the 80s and early 90s.  Also, in The New Lassie show, there's an older grown man version of Timmy from the older series.  Lassie, though, is inexplicably younger and still alive...  What other explanation could there be of this?  They say that the dog is a present day decedent of the older dog, but my thoughts are that the dog in New Lassie is the older dog, and that's the excuse they apply to a dog living that long because the alternative is impossible.  Lassie was exploring out in the wild the majority of the time in the later seasons.  Where would she find a pure bred Sheltie out in the middle of nowhere to breed with and create this supposed offspring?  The remake of Lassie in 97 can be considered non-canon with the earlier series.

So, if Lassie were an alien, what would be her objective?  It seems to be that Lassie is a benevolent creature, helping out where she can and being friend to both human and animal.  She takes on an almost Superman responsibility, though the creature who inhabits her body is only able to do justice in the form of a dog.  A much harder task than being a God among mortals, like Superman.

Perhaps the alien is like The Thing in John Carpenter's The Thing, able to shape shift into the form of whatever creature in infects on first contact.  Only this alien is stuck with Lassie.

Another curious thought...  If the film Lassie Come Home is supposed to be considered canon, then how did Lassie get across the ocean from England to America?  Could she have swam with alien powers?  Or perhaps snuck aboard a freighter? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Planning a trip to Japan! Questions about Secret Flying and saving money... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-29 07:45:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, a few friends and I are planning a trip to Japan sometime this year.  I personally want to shoot for September to save money and possibly spend two weeks there.

My friend got interested in the prospect of going April-May due to some Secret Flying deals we found online.  I'm thinking that those deals might be there when September comes around, plus I hear Japan is great that time of year, yet my friend thinks that we'd save money going in April using this secret deal, and that we may miss out and have to pay double for a ticket in September.

So, our concerns are:

1. How frequent are deals like this to come up on Secret Flying?  The current two deals we can see are flights out of Chicago for around 500 USD.  Will a deal like that come up again?

2. Are there any benefits besides the weather to going to Japan in Spring rather than Autumn or vice versa?

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TITLE> [SPOILERS]In Son of Saul, something happens in the background that is completely unsettling, but mostly ignored by the characters. What other movies make effective use of the background? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-24 19:54:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The scene I'm speaking of, which you may have even missed, is when Saul is walking back to a corner of the underground gas chambers to speak to a comrade about his son.  When he passes the main room, you can hear dozens if not hundreds of people vomiting all at the same time.  It's completely unnerving and terrifying to think about, but the film largely ignores it as cavalier as Saul goes about his plan to bury his son.

It's incredibly effective at showing how the sonderkommando unit is just used to the horrors within Auschwitz.  That they don't even really think about it anymore...

Are there other films that take advantage of this idea?  Not necessarily for disturbing content, but other things as well? </TEXT>

Although, I am very aware by what seems like an almost viral push to get this show better ratings.  There have been lots of articles posted here about how The Expanse is the second coming of Christ, and all that.  I can see how some people my be turned off by that aggressive push to get attention.  But honestly?  This is one of the best shows to come out of SyFy in years, and it's honestly worth checking out.

So, what did you all think of the series as a whole? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> With XCOM 2 and Fire Emblem coming out, I thought it would be interesting to hear /r/games' opinion on the gameplay mechanic of permadeath.

What I mean in this context is when a game character dies and is no longer able to be used...  This is usually prominent in tactical/strategy games, but I remember Diablo 3 having a 'Hardcore' mode as well.

I have been experimenting with both Classic mode in Fire Emblem and Ironman mode in XCOM Enemy Within, and while I find myself getting annoyed and restarting a game before it has a chance to save when I've lost too many troops...  It's a more nerve wracking experience, and something truly unique.  We're too accustomed to restarting when we don't get our way, but now these games have consequences.  I'm already fearful of my soldier's lives in both games...  I'm nervous that I'll make a stupid mistake in the future.

What do you all think? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I do a short fiction podcast that mostly revolves around my voice, but I need voice work done for episodes where other characters come in.  Each episode usually lasts 30-60 minutes, but I'm considering using shorter episodes.  I have used people who volunteer to do VO work for a bit, but now I'm having trouble getting a good turn around...  I have two scripts out in the ether at the moment that I haven't had a return on.  I'm figuring paying my VAs might motivate them a bit more...

Problem is, I work a 9-5 entry level job, and I could only really afford to pay actors between $100-200 a month, depending on how many I use.  I was wondering if paying a $100 would be appropriate...

Is that a decent rate for amateur voice work? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Should Rockstar remove the 'comedy' from GTA? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-13 21:38:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I think a lot of people are feeling that their use of comedy is becoming juvenile and actually taking away from the dramatic stories that they want to tell.  I feel like 'missed potential' comes up a lot in discussions of GTA V's writing.  I feel as if Rockstar is unwilling to shake this schtick that the worlds that GTA lives in have to be ridiculous.  There's this belief that the over-the-top comedic world that the GTA titles live in act as a buffer for the horrific violence you commit within them, but I believe that gamers have matured enough to which that argument just isn't valid anymore.  The Jack Thompson's of the world have realized they've lost.  Violence in video games is here to stay, and plenty of studies find that violent video games are more cathartic than anger-inducing.  

The creative comedy writing actually worked in GTA 3's benefit because they still weren't willing to go into the crassness of swearing, sexual humor, and racial humor.  They had to think of clever jokes that didn't rely on cursing and other lewd humor.  I think that worked to their benefit, and it eased players into this silly world better...

Their humor now comes off at a poor man's attempt at South Park humor...  And they want to say something 'important' about American society, but people are so aware of it and it's so blatant that fans are just getting tired of it.  I know I am.

Of course, I could be wrong.  I thought GTA V's Lamar was a fantastic character, and his use of crass over-the-top humor really worked in his favor.  It's just the world itself...  the advertisements, radio stations, car names...  GTA V feels like a new Adam Sandler movie.  We get it, you're known for your crass humor...  But we're almost 30 now.  It isn't funny anymore. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I posted a thread like this a few years ago, and it was an awesome success.  It has been a year or so, and there have been an awesome amount of audiobooks released in that time.

Some of my recommendations:

Any of the new Star Wars books are pretty great.  They include John Williams fanfare and sound effects.  I've listened to Lost Stars, and it was a lot of fun.  Planning on listening to the Battlefront book next, because I hear it has the same deal.  I've even heard the production quality makes Aftermath bearable.  

American Gods:
This one was recommended to me the last thread, and I have to say it is a definite winner.  Having a full cast doing an unabridged novel actually sucks you into the story really well.  Same goes for books like World War Z.

I've actually really enjoyed the Expanse series partially because of narrator Jefferson Mays.  He really knows how to give each character a specific voice, and he knows how to do female voices very subtly.  Definite recommend for hard sci-fi fans.

What are your recommendations /r/books? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It blows my mind that this film isn't on the Criterion Collection.  Or that no company has pushed for a proper blurry release...  Not only is it one of the best and most gut wrenching holocaust movies to ever be made, but it also is from a perspective of the holocaust we don't usually see.  

There's a large focus on the Jewish losses in World War Two in Americanized history, and while those are important, I think it's completely flabbergasting that people don't know how much more the Russians lost in the war.  Not only by the Nazis, but also by their own government.  It's thought that the civilian death toll in Russia was around 14 million, but the shocking thing is they aren't even sure...  So many people died on the Eastern Front, and media usually tends to ignore that part of history for the American side.

This film made quite an impression on me when I first saw it.  It is unashamed with its devastating imagery, and it conveys that devastation through a protagonist that not only suffered as a character but also as an actor.  The folk stories behind this film about the lead actor's hair turning white from all the PTSD-inducing artillery they surrounded him with is incredibly interesting to read about and reflective of Soviet film making.

I highly recommend this film, and it just bothers me that it's such a hidden little film...  I really hope someone picks up the rights to the film so it can get a proper blurry distribution.   </TEXT>

<TITLE> I think Skull Face knew more then what was presented... </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I think Skull Face knew that Venom was a imposter.

There's a scene during the mission where you take a car ride with Skull Face that kind of threw me off. When you first approach him, he pushes his guards aside, and then the camera pulls in real close to his face. There's this weird noise as he utters the phrase, "You hope hatred might someday replace the pain. But it never goes away. It makes a man hideous, inside and out." The camera zooms into his face, and locks there in a way the camera normally doesn't do...  Usually, the camera is following snake along like a handi-cam, but this time it is completely locked on his head.

After he utters this phrase, Venom puts down his gun. Miller assumes that Snake is going to go along with him to get his shot, but during that cutscene/gameplay, Venom can get no where near Skull Face. You have to follow a set path to the car, and you can only go a set speed. You also can't get anywhere near Skull Face.  It's the mechanics telling you that you are no longer really in control of Venom.  If you think about how Venom interacts with his men, he knocks them around and jumps into them, etc...  But here Snake is locked down.  He can't do anything.  It's a very strange moment. I think that's why Venom is so silent during the car ride. He's under some kind of Sleeper agent activation code. 

The only thing Skull Face didn't expect was Volgin and Psycho Mantis turning on him. If you notice, even if you shoot Skull Face when he's under the rubble, you can't kill him.  Snake never goes for the kill shot, and Miller even has to try and help him to make it happen. Instead, he goes for the next best thing, crippling him.

The idea of sleeper agents in this isn't too crazy.  The idea is very popular in Cold War fiction, starting with Manchurian Candidate.  In fact, at the end of the game, 'The Man Who Sold the World' tape seems to be the only thing that brings Venom out of his Big Boss trance, which also could be considered a sleeper agent activation.  

tl;dr Skull Face knew Venom was a doppelganger, and he knew a sleeper agent activation code to stop him from killing him. </TEXT>

3. Any adverse effects from being that close?  Cancer?  Radiation poisoning?
4. Did it change your opinion of nuclear armament?  If so, how?

We've gotten to the point where we're in this room, and Niner says to get rid of this 'Gormless Idiot' that's in the room with us.  Every time I talk to him though, all the NPC says is, "What do you need?" Before the conversation ends.

I feel like I'm supposed to kill him or something, but I'm not sure, and when I talk to Niner, he is just his normal self with orders and what not...

Am I missing something, or is Niner glitched? </TEXT>

<TITLE> [REQUEST] Looking for a female voice actor for a possible reoccurring part in my short fiction podcast: The Morning Report </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-21 20:09:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The Morning Report is a podcast that takes place inside the top secret facility Area 51.  The host, Simon, gives the morning announcements: Birthdays, deaths, news etc. and then he tells a story...  The stories are declassified files he is given by the management of Area 51.  

Here is my website where you can listen to the first episode:

https://themorningreport.squarespace.com

Currently, the podcast is only one episode deep, and I had a friend lined up to do the voice work of a character I'm writing currently.  Unfortunately, things fell through, and I want to keep to a strict timeline of updating every 2 weeks.  This character, named Raquel, would possibly be a reoccurring character that would appear from time to time as the story goes on.

Here are some details on the character:

Raquel is an Army private who has just come home from her first tour in Iraq to celebrate with her family and her boyfriend's family.  Her family is Dominican, and very traditional, but she was born and raised in the States with her brothers.  So, if she had any kind of accent to her voice, it would be barely noticeable.  Her brothers are all vets as well, so I want to give the audience the sense that this character is a disciplined, military minded woman, who has been surrounded by the lifestyle all her life.  In the context of the podcast though, this episode will refer to her debriefing after surviving a paranormal event.

Here's a line of dialogue you can send me if interested:

"Was I mad about it, yeah I was...  I mean, I'm not the boasting type, but I felt like I was as tough as any of those other boys in the Rangers.  Wallace included..." (Pause)

"Wallace would be tripping right now if he was here.  He was always into those conspiracy shows, like that one about Aliens in Ancient Egypt.  What was it called?  I don't know...  Heh, you know it's funny, it's not his smile or the way he kissed me that I miss...  It's stupid shit like that."

Feel free to message me on Reddit.
I'm also available at the following email address:
the.morning.report.podcast@gmail.com

**I should mention that I don't really have the income to pay someone.  If things go well, and I start making donations or getting advertisements, then I will draft percentages to be taken out of the lump sum for every month.  Until then, I'm doing this for free.  I'm up on iTunes and I have a pretty decent site.  It's about building content and finding an audience right now.** </TEXT>

<TITLE> Pilot episode of my new Podcast: "The Morning Report" A short science fiction podcast that takes place within the underbelly of Area 51. Looking for advice/critique! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-12 01:27:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm looking for critique and advice on how to proceed with this podcast.  So far, it only exists on Youtube, but I'm working on getting a RSS feed and putting it up on iTunes and other platforms.  I'm also looking to build a website for the podcast, and I've been looking at Squarespace (A site which every podcaster seems to advertise.) to build up from.  I'd like to know if that site is workable for updating podcasts, if there's an easy way to set up a way to download episodes, etc.

[Here is the actual episode.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z35Z7qvmW2c)

There's cursing, so it may be NSFW.

Basically, the show is about a radio host that works as human relations/radio within Area 51.  He gives the announcements, lunch menu, etc, and then tells a story about a declassified file.  It gets paranormal, spooky, comical from there.  It's kind of like a X-Files/Twilight Zone 'story of the week' format, though I'm looking to update every two weeks to a month.

I'm also looking for critique on the following aspects of my podcast:

1. What did you like/dislike about the writing?
2. How's my voice acting?
3. How was the agent's voice acting?
4. Did the sound effects sound believable?
5. Did my mix down sound good? (I'm using Adobe Audition.  It's a learning process, but I like it a lot.)
6. How should I go about building an audience?  Are their sites fiction listeners would suggest?
7. How far into my podcast should I get before asking for donations?  I was thinking 5-6 episodes of steady releases.
8. What are some good links for copyright information?  Is there any concerns I should have with making a fiction podcast over a non-fiction/news/talk show?

This is my first podcast, and I'm excited but nervous about putting a fiction podcast out there.  I'd appreciate any feedback.

Thank you! </TEXT>

<TITLE> A LOT of games that have come out recently have been released in a broken state. (Master Chief Collection, Assassin's Creed Unity, Evil Within) I think we should require a higher standard by not only the devs, but the stores that sell these games... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-20 08:03:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> What I mean is this:

If you were to buy a movie, say...  From Wal-Mart.  You take it home, enjoy yourself, but near the end the movie it just stops.  No ending, no resolution...  Nothing.  It turns out that the people who made the movie and put it on DVD didn't make it right, so all the DVDs are permanently messed up like this.  They state that they'll have a replacement disk sent to those with the messed up movie, and that they can expect the movie to be in a 'better state' soon.

Only this doesn't happen with movies.  This NEVER happens because the people who put films on DVD usually have a certain standard to abide by.  This doesn't happen with any other product save Video Games.  With everything else, it is completely fine to recall a product when it doesn't work, but Video Games escape that loop hole.

Why?

And I know, Video Games are vastly different than films.  And you really can't stress test an online game like WoW without putting it out to everyone, but games like Unity, Halo, and Evil Within really have no excuse.

I think that's weird.  I feel if store chains, Gamestop, Wal-Mart, GAME, Best Buy, whatever...  Recalled Video Games for being broken messes, or even added a warning label to the game box, then we wouldn't have these issues like this.  Devs don't seem to be getting the hint that Gamers don't like getting broken products, but the average Joe who goes out and buys a game without researching it online make up for those complaints by buying it.  They see a jump in profit regardless, so there's no need to fix it.

If games that came out broken appeared with this label:
"WARNING: This game is in a unpolished state.  Upcoming patches may fix the current issues, but that is not guaranteed.  BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK"

I think the average Joe or parent buying a game for his/her child would stop and think about their purchase.  I guarantee devs and publishers would TAKE FUCKING NOTICE.

If store chains were held to a certain standard, a certain amount of rigorous testing of the game before it goes on shelves, I think we'd have stronger products with longer time spent on them to work out all the kinks.

Devs like Rockstar and Valve always take a TON of time on making their games.  And online problems aside, the usually deliver a solid product that manages to WORK on Day 1.  I know GTA V's online fiasco isn't quite a good example, but that falls into Online problems, which no one can really prepare for with the massive stress that a real multiplayer community would give the game.  Regardless, they should be the standard to strive to.

A lot of people put blame on the publishers, and yeah they are to blame for pushing out a unfinished product, but I think retailers can really help the video game community by being stricter on what kind of game is pushed out.  They wouldn't suffer for it either.  Best Buy will keep selling TVs and Washing machines.  Wal-Mart sells food for Christ's sake.  The ONLY people I think who could suffer is the video game stores.  But hell, Gamestop has been monopolizing the market for far too long...  So I wouldn't feel too bad about it if they lost some profit.

What do you guys think? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I work a number of jobs to pay off my loans.  Problem is, a lot of my freelance work comes in a bit randomly at times.  I can go a month without any work, or get a flurry of jobs within a matter of weeks.  Getting paid comes in randomly as well.  I work as a freelance editor, and sometimes payment can take 30-90 days. (I know, it sucks.) 

I have a number of student loans that I need to pay every month, and while I currently don't have a problem getting money, it's just getting the money at an appropriate time.  I am constantly late on my loans because my checks come in at the crappiest times.

I'm thinking that I could pay off the debt with a credit card, and then when my money comes in pay off the debt on the credit card.  I need to build a good bit of credit anyway.

Is this a good idea? </TEXT>

<TITLE> (Recommendation)Bojack Horseman: A show with a shitty start that has one of the most heartbreaking season finales I've ever seen. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-02 10:40:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This show is hard to write about...

Bojack Horseman is an animated show about a washed out 90s TV star, a anthropomorphic horse, and his wacky cast of friends and lovers in his life.  He's trying to publish a memoir about his days before, during and after his stint on a family comedy about him as a single dad taking care of three human kids.

I'm writing this because the beginning of Bojack is bad.  Like, really bad.  It's obvious that this was pitched as a Netflix-exclusive Family Guy rip off, and it shows.  Break away jokes, 'remember the time when' jokes, unlikeable characters...  It all seethes with this aura of, Oh, I've seen this before...  I will admit, I didn't laugh much in Bojack.  I'm not sure if the writer's are very good at comedy, but I have to give a lot of credit to the background artists.  The strongest 'jokes' are the situational comedic moments of this being some kind of mad furry/human world in modern day LA.  In this LA, these anthro creatures are just part of life.  They've been a part of our culture and history, and I like all the subtle world building the show does through that.

But I wish something of you /r/animation.  I'd like for you to give Bojack Horseman a chance.  You have to suffer for a while, about five episodes, but that's when Bojack does a 180 and turns into something more...  Something different.  Bojack is hard to recommend.  My two roommates both watched it before me, and they turned it off in the middle of the first episode.  I didn't think much of it...  Just a failed show Netflix was trying out. (I think it was an attempt to compete against Hulu's The Awesomes.) Then I saw a thread on 4chan about it.  A 300+ post thread about how the show made them 'feel', rather than laugh.  I got curious...

I'm a big fan of a little unknown show on Adult Swim called Moral Orel.  Not many people watched it, and the people who have seem to think it was just a show picking on religion.  And it was, but Moral Orel took a chance and began to show wonderful set of ideas.  It subverted your expectations and did a 180, turning from a 'wacky comedy' to a dark drama about hate, alcoholism and neglect.  It was one of the biggest surprises in Animation, or TV, and I still don't understand why people don't talk about it more.  It doesn't even have a DVD release...  I feel like Bojack could be the next Moral Orel.  The next attempt for a TV show to take your expectations and scatter them.

I don't want to say much about the show.  The episodes past six are all very heart-straining and sad, watching as this Horse digs his hole deeper and deeper...  It's a hard show to recommend, but if you like having something metamorphosis into something at least somewhat interesting, then I give a high recommendation to Bojack.  Episode 11 has some fantastic visual story telling, and the finale moments of that episode really make you sink into your chair and feel like complete shit.  It's a feel bad show, but there are those of us out there that like to feel bad.

I want this show to have a second season.  I want the writers to realize they have something here, and that they should drop trying to be like other comedies.  Family Guy may sell well and be a money making product, but shows like Bojack and Moral Orel are trying to make ART.  We need more shows like this, even if it does take it a while to get good.

Also, for those who have watched it.  [Have some feels.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFLJFl7ws_0) </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Feedback] First chapter of a Horror/Romance story. Tokyo Black (7,302 Words) [Explicit Content] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-06-12 23:43:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> https://docs.google.com/document/d/17sEYB_8-g-0mBndU2gnfbMAoaoq7pJHKLsIAuJ5-w3Q/edit

This is the first chapter of a horror/romance story set in Tokyo.  The first few chapters are setting up the characters and don't really touch on anything romantic, but there is some content here I'd like to run by /r/shutupandwrite to see if it works:

1. The Setting.  I have never been to Tokyo, but my story is a bit of a pulpy take on the city.  It takes place a few years in the future, so I feel I can take a few liberties with some of the elements of the city.  Nevertheless, this first chapter has little of Tokyo actually in it.  I still want to see how what I've written so far runs by those familiar with the area.

2. Show Don't Tell.  Seeing as how the monster is one of the main characters, I decided to do a mix of both showing and telling to explain her and her abilities to the audience through the dissection scene.  I don't know if this works, or if its explaining her too much too soon.  I'd appreciate thoughts on this scene.

3. 1st Person? I'm telling this story in the first person with the monster in the lead.  I know this will take some of the horror from the story, but I'm switching between two (Possibly 3-4) characters later in the story.  Still, I'd like to see if this chapter works on it's own in First Person.

4. I'm going to remove the bit about 'She has no matter!' seeing as how it's impossible.  I was trying to go for something Lovecraftian.

My goal is to make the reader uncomfortable with the story I'm writing, in both the romance and the gore.  But, I also want to capture a sweet romance with my lead characters as the story develops.  I can see comparisons to books like Twilight, but I'm trying to deconstruct that convention a bit.  This story would be about damaged, evil people as opposed to the shiny, love-stricken characters of books like Twilight.

Anyway, I'd appreciate any feedback!  Also, if any sentence structure comes off as wrong or weird, please let me know. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me, the tutorial I always jump back to is [Smiling Jack's introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aa8B7hIynE) in the game Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines.  Its a pretty typical tutorial in terms of game play and explaining things to the player, but the excellent writing is what makes it stand out for me.

I'm also curious about what /r/games thinks of the NEED for tutorials in modern games.  Could we hypothetically just release a modern game, lets say a new GTA, without any instruction?  Could we rely on a player's curiosity and familiarity with previous games to carry them forward?

<TEXT> I have kind of a mixed reaction to fanfiction.  Because, if you think about it, the label itself has bad connotations.  Yet, a great majority of the superhero comics coming out today are technically fan fiction of someone else's characters.

Some very popular films are fan fiction.   Bond films comes to mind.  

So, do you guys think writing is good or bad for devloping your writing ability? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Student Loans are seriously making my life difficult. Both Federal and Bank... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-04-08 17:48:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A lot of this can be put on me for not thinking ahead, but I seriously don't know what to do here.  I'm working as much as I can right now, and while I don't have a job for my degree's caliber, I feel like my two jobs should be able to pay these loans, but they can't.  I'm still finding myself late or completely out of money.

I have an art degree in a major I didn't really want due to unforeseen circumstances while I was going through school.  Its a long story, but the gist of it is the major I wanted to be in required internships that they didn't help you find, you had to pay tuition to the school to have them count, and that were required to graduate.  I ended up switching majors in the last year to something I could graduate in.  Its been a few years since I got out of school, and I'm constantly struggling to pay these loans.  

I work two jobs, one where I work most the week and make about 15 bucks an hour and another which is freelance, and erratic, that I make about 18 an hour.  I have a third job coming up as well, but that's freelance too.  And it sounds like it may not be worth it.

I have two loans total, one federal and one bank.  The bank loan compounds around 370 dollars a month while the federal, if I don't defer, is around 330.

That's 700 a month that I just don't have.  I can defer the federal loan for the third time, but that still doesn't help with the bank loan which won't let me defer unless I declare bankruptcy.

I really don't think it should be this hard for me to live a normal life after college, with or without well-paying job, but it seems like it is.

I don't really know what to do from here... 

Can I get some advice? </TEXT>

<TITLE> [NSFW] Researching for a novel I'm working on. I would love some info on Kabukich. I have some questions on the sex industry there as well... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-04-02 18:47:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I recently have been listening to Jake Adelstein's book 'Tokyo Vice' and its inspired me to work on a novel set in the areas of Kabukich.  Problem is I have never been there, and I don't have the income to go explore either.  So I'll have to make due with research.

Firstly, I understand that the Yakuza ran a good bit of that area in the 90s, and they had a big hand in tricking girls into the sex industry, even some foreigners,  but I'm really kind of curious about what influence the Yakuza has on the area in the modern age.

-What is the drug industry like in Tokyo?  A character I have thought up is a pot dealer who sells to foreigners in Kabukich and Akhibara.  How plausible would that be?

-Are the Shinseikai family pretty much top dogs, or is it all split up between multiple clans?  Who are the big clans in Kabukich? Are the Yamaguchi-gumi still present?

-I'm assuming gun laws in Japan are pretty strict, so it would be hard to find many Yakuza who are armed with guns.  Is that true though?

-I read in the book that Japan's prostitution laws in the 90s were really only enforced on those who were looking to do vaginal penetration.  Is that still the case?

-Have there been any strange or interesting themed sex clubs that have popped up with the popularity rise of anime/manga?

-What are the police like in Kabukich?  Corrupt?  Better?

-What changes are becoming present in these areas with women's rights growing more relevant in Japan?  I understand that Japan is in a sort of transitional stage with Women having less traditional roles.

-What role do women have in the Yakuza?  Are such roles changing?

I may think of more questions as I write.  I may edit them in or ask in the comments section.

Thanks for any help!

<TITLE> Writing a 'light novel' for Japanese audiences? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-03-25 00:47:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This may be quite the difficult question to answer, but I was wondering if there was any possible way that I could write a 'light novel', (A novella which is around 20,000 words.) and possibly market it to Japanese audiences?

I'm an American and I cannot speak Japanese, but I feel like I could write a series, (One that I've already been working on.) that would appeal to Japanese markets.  The only problem is the language barrier.  I cannot speak Japanese, but I'm not beyond hiring a translator.  Getting a manga illustration would be no problem.  I know plenty of artists I can pay to help me.

    Ajay Naidu as Ajay Shah
    Nicki Clyne as Sharon
    Jeri Ryan as Maria Zhuganova
    Henry Rollins as T. Sean Collins
    Maz Jobrani as Ahmed Farahnakian
    Mark Hamill as Todd Wainio
    Eamonn Walker as Xolelwa Azania / Paul Redeker / David Allen Forbes
    Jrgen Prochnow as Philip Adler
    David Ogden Stiers as Bohdan Taras Kondratiuk
    Michelle Kholos as Jesika Hendricks
    Kal Penn as Sardar Khan
    Alan Alda as Arthur Sinclair Junior
    Rob Reiner as "The Whacko"
    Dean Edwards as Joe Muhammad
    Frank Darabont as Roy Elliot
    Becky Ann Baker as Christina Eliopolis
    Parminder Nagra as Barati Palshigar
    Brian Tee as Hyungchoi / Michael Choi
    Masi Oka as Kondo Tatsumi
    Frank Kamai as Tomonaga Ijiro
    John Turturro as Seryosha Garcia Alvarez
    Ric Young as Admiral Xu Zhicai
    Alfred Molina as Terry Knox
    John McElroy as Ernesto Olguin
    Common as Darnell Hackworth
    F. Murray Abraham as Father Sergei Ryzhkov
    Rene Auberjonois as Andre Renard

I don't know of an audiobook that does something like that.  It really elevates the storytelling and gives a specific voice to every character.  It gives me the shivers every time I start it up.

Are there any audiobooks you can think of that does the same? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, if you didn't hear already, apparently when you pick up a new weapon in GTA V, no matter what kind of weapon it is, it will be permanently stored in your inventory even if you're arrested or killed.

This, in my opinion, sounds like it makes things way too easy.  I feel like there should at least be some options to where you can only hold one of each class of weapon, or even a hardcore mode where holding a large amount of weapons affects your running speed.  It'd be neat to give the character a bag to hold all his guns too.

Just my two cents... </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Request]Action anime where a character isn't over powered or overly confident. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-08-16 12:28:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> One trope I've noticed in anime is when certain characters, good guys and bad guys, have this sort of over-confidence in their abilities.  I don't mind a character having a little bit of swagger, but the idea of a MC being all haughty taughty because he made a plan 6 moves in advance that requires him to do very little to win just seems boring to me.

I want something where the action feels more dire.  A good example of this is Steins;Gate.  No one in that show knows what the hell is going on, and so it makes things much more dramatic when they're scrambling to meet their goals.

I just want some vulnerable characters...  Some that don't have this Sword Art Online over-powered nonsense. </TEXT>
</WRITING>
<WRITING>
<TITLE> I feel like I have to recommend Steins;Gate to as many people as I can. Including /r/television. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-08-07 21:49:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Yes, Steins;Gate is an anime, but its one of the most interesting anime programs I have seen in years.  So much so that I feel as if outsiders to anime could actually really enjoy this show.

The basic plot is that a bunch of nerds and freaks, the kind you'd see in IT Crowd or Freaks   Geeks, accidentally discover time travel.  If you've ever seen the film Primer it has a very similar idea and tone.  The show starts off as silly hijinks with the friends seeing what they can change by using their time machine, which allows them to send text messages into the past.  Eventually though, things get out of hand and it spirals from there.  I won't spoil much, but the show gets INTENSE.

Anime is hard to recommend to normal television audiences because there seems to be a selected audience for it as well as cultural differences that don't appeal to American audiences.  This show on the other hand, is amazing...  I feel that even with the typical anime tropes thrown in, people who've never opened up to anime before could actually really enjoy the show.

If you want to check it out, here's a link to the first episode:

(SUB) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsr-UiTPWsU

(DUB) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz-L_sgaLUY

So please try and give the show a chance.  I'd recommend the subs over the dubbed version, seeing as how I think the VAs in the subbed version give better performances, but its up to you guys. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have an old-school xbox 360, and I don't know about you guys, but I can't remember the last time I had 8 gigs free on my HD.  I'm wondering if it would be a wise move for Rockstar to ship a Flash Drive with the game, maybe even custom made for it, so players who aren't informed don't have to drive out for one after they bought the game.

I have no problem buying one, but I have to admit that it might seem bad when 360 players realize they have to make a 8 gig install before they can play.  Shipping a flash drive with the Xbox version of the game could make that process much easier. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did find it a bit interesting though...  This series is basically how a Bond Villain enlists his/her henchmen.  The entire series is basically Koko brainwashing the poor child to her way of thinking by subtly exposing him to more and more violence until her way of solving things makes sense.  But it makes me hate every character in the squad now, seeing as how they are all complacent with this obviously flawed plan that involves the deaths of 700,000 civilians.  And they're all so hopeful about it.  Like they're trying to convince the audience its for the greater good.

I also like how they shifted my perception from hating Kaspar to completely liking and respecting him.  Kaspar laughing in Koko's face about her plan was exactly what I was thinking... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think Shinji might have been a clone in the new movie.  Here are a few details I noticed while watching:

-Never shown to be taken out of Unit 1.  For all we know, he may not have been in there.

-Being held inside the same containment unit that Asuka was held in after her body was presumably destroyed in 2.0.

-Asked a series of questions about facial recognition, what he last remembers, etc.

-Conveniently reawakened 14 years after 2.0, the age of Shinji at that time.

-Everyone is cold towards this Shinji, including Misato, who encouraged him to act against what was expected of him in 2.0.

-Shinji is told he has a 0% synchronization rate, yet is able to pilot an Eva later in the film. Is possibly being compensated by Kaworu.

-Shinji asks why Asuka is still so young to which she replies, "Curse of the LCL." That could mean a number of things. Isn't Rei required to be submerged in LCL to stay alive?

-DDS collar shown to either be ineffective or not even used when Misato has the trigger. If she really hates Shinji for the 3rd Impact, she would have detonated it. Pretty much implied that Misato couldn't have killed this Shinji even if she wanted to.  Plus it seems pretty stupid to hesitate when the world is so close to the brink.  It was set to trigger if the 4th impact happened. 

-Kaworu claims that the DDS collar was meant for him, implying that WILLE stole the collar from NERV.  Could they have stolen Shinji too?

-Shinji can inexplicably play piano with no prior training. Possibly planted inside him so that he would synch well with Kaworu.  You can't explain this by the Synch, because it took Shinji and Asuka a week to match togther PLAYING TWISTER.

-Kaworu seems confused by the 'duplicate' spears, seeing things as 'not right.' Most likely because this Shinji isn't the right Shinji.

<TITLE> Grand Theft Auto V Hotseat anyone? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-07-19 10:23:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> To explain what Hotseat is: Its basically passing the controller to someone on the couch with you.  Multiplayer gaming without multiple controllers.  The most recent example I can think of is the Hotseat mode in Civilization V where you take turns one person at a time.

I could see this working greatly in GTA V.  Three friends playing the game together, each given a specific character, and each making separate decisions outside of the other player's opinions.  I could see this working pretty easily in free roam, and then a goofy, hectic hot potato trade off during missions where 2-3 protagonists are in the level.

I could even see a hotseat mode, where players couldn't advance in the story until someone else has continued on with their respective character.

<TEXT> I just got back from the theater, and frankly...   I do not understand why the score is so low.

When you compare this film to a film like Iron Man 3, Man of Steel is obviously the better movie, yet the disposition between their RT scores is almost baffling.  

Man of Steel was a really good movie.  Sure, it had it's flaws, but I really enjoyed the film.  And I know I'm not alone in thinking this.  Personally, most my friends enjoyed the movie.  All of my friends who love comics loved the movie.  On Rotten Tomatoes, there's an 82% of positive reviews for audience members.  The only people who didn't seem to like the movie are the critics.

Which brings up some obvious questions.  Why was there this gap between what general audiences thought and what the critics thought? </TEXT>

You'd spare thousands upon thousands of lives, but the steppe's would probably never be united and the country of Mongolia wouldn't be what it is today.  

It's an interesting topic to think about, because there's always the possibility of ruining future events with the ability to wipe someone from history.

And it brings up questions: There were obviously like-minded people like Hitler in Germany at the time.  Would killing him really stop World War 2 from happening?  Someone may just take his place.

So choose your answers with the thought process of what would happen after such a person was killed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Despite how you feel about the game, like it or leave it, you have to admit the disguise system in the game is completely broken.  There's no way every cop in in Chicago knows every other cop, and the idea that they can recognize that you are not a part of their crew is completely unrealistic.  I understand this is done for the reasoning of having balanced game mechanics, and I understand that the disguise system can be exploited if those restrictions weren't in place, but there clearly has to be an alternative.

<TEXT> I am sure there are plenty of stories about being IN the combat zone, but I am actually curious about the process and small details more then anything.  Here's a few questions that come to mind...

1. Does insurance cover such a job, also is there any special benefits or perks for doing this kind of work?

2. How does one get asked to go into a active war zone?  Do you immediately get in contact with a platoon or something to be imbedded with, or do you take a on-the-ground stance and look about for interesting stories?

3. What is the procedure if you find yourself in the hands of 'the enemy' or troops not on the side with the troops you are imbedded with?

4. Is there any temptation to pick up a gun and join the fight?

5. I have heard that many news organizations pick up stories from independent reporters out in the field.  How accurate is this, and do YOU approach them or do THEY approach you?

6. What is in your bag?  What equipment do you ALWAYS carry when out in a war zone?

7. When witnessing someone wounded or in need of help, is there a procedure NOT to interfere, or is it up to the reporter's discretion?

8. Who is better to work with, Fox or CNN?  Which pays better?

9. Any signs of PTSD when returning home?  Is there an itch to get 'back in the shit' like some armed personnel have?

10. Any tips for a freelance reporter wanting to do what YOU do? </TEXT>

It just locks the entire game up. BOSS sees no errors or conflicts, and I've already checked on the Frostfall site, and I have no mods that conflict with it.

I'm thinking its maybe another mod I have installed. I have one mod that distributes random items to NPCs, and I'm guessing maybe its cause I didn't craft the tent myself? I really don't know. Any ideas? </TEXT>

<TITLE> I just had one of the best gaming experiences of my life, and I was role playing as Hitler the entire time. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-01-12 10:45:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> (No racism or anti-Semitic behavior involved.) 

I just had one of the best gaming experiences of my life on a Garry's Mod server.

A little information to explain:  On Garry's mod, there are a number of servers under the label of DarkRP.  RP servers are kind of infamous on Gmod.  Players can set up little businesses, be involved with the police or crime, or even become mayor of the entire town.  The server I was playing on was a WW2 Occupation themed server, and I just so happened to land the role of The Fuhrer, in charge of the entire Reich army.

How I got this position was merely luck.  Players have the opportunity to vote for positions they'd like to hold.  Each player can vote yes or no on that request.  It gets kind of cluster fucked at times, because people will get demoted for legal and illegal actions in the game.  The basic rule is that Nazis can't fire on Resistance without cause.  If they find a resistance member suspicious, they can search said member and then jail him.  The system is a bit flawed and easily abused, but it works in a weird way.  

So anyway, I nail the role of Hitler, and thankfully I'm already inside the Reichstag. (The Nazi's Base) I start to discuss what we could do as Hitler with the guy who would become my SS Officer.  I decided that I wanted to give a speech and give the resistance a little event to pop a shot at me. 

I have the SS Officer set things up, and I update the agenda with details on my speech.  I also type out a little advert for everyone in the server, giving the resistance the word.  Eventually, the speech was ready to give, and about  15-20 players (There are 50+ in the server at times) followed me out to the courtyard steps as I prepped my speech.

I opened up youtube in steam and mic spammed one of Hitler's speeches, and all the players who were playing German troops started taking pictures of me with the camera tool.  In terms of RP events, it felt pretty legit.

I didn't hear the shot, but soon everyone began to panic.  My SS Officer and Kommandant escorted me from the podium, running back into the Reichstag through the garage.  From the garage, I ordered for my troops to look for the assassin and I initialized a lockdown.  A lockdown is a state of gameplay where the streets are supposed to be cleared by civilians and resistance.  German troops basically institute a curfew and either arrest or shoot violators on sight.
This is where the real meat of the session began.  I began to give more and more orders from my office, establishing a relatively stable rule for the Reich.  This kind of pissed off the Resistance and Citizens outside.  The tone of the server seems very anarchic at times, so with the Reich having order it seemed to really swing things around.  Thing is, a lot of kids come on the server as well.  You know the type, young 12-15 year olds shooting people at random and calling them faggots or whatever.  Thankfully, my SS Officer and Kommandant kept them in line.  I had a lot of requests and meetings as my short time as Fuhrer.  Some were to report suspicious activity, others were just requests for orders.  I eventually began to get overwhelmed and told them to report to the SS or Kommandant for orders.

I didn't stay Hitler however...

At one point, the server crashed.  This meant everyone had to reset their roles.  I lost my role as Fuhrer temporarily, but the person who took it was rather entertaining.  He went by Krieger, and he was a German-Speaking player ONLY.  That's right, we had a Fuhrer that could not speak a word of English in charge of the entire Reich on a ENGLISH server.  The SS Officer and I found this quite hilarious, and tried a number of ways to communicate with our new leader.  We started posting adverts and requests for other German speakers who could translate, but eventually decided that it was too difficult.  The Fuhrer left the Reichstag and started to walk about.  The SS Officer and me began asking random people on the streets if they could kill The Fuhrer.  Most thought we were trying to bait them, but when we explained the situation it led to laughter.

Eventually he was killed and I was placed back in power.  I continued my business as usual.  I tried to be as fair as possible, (I issued lotteries, asked for my troops to request warrants before entering buildings, etc.) but things began to push against me.  I got snippets of information from my Gestapo agent of gathering forces at a bar down the street.  I sent my troops to investigate, and it eventually led to a series of skirmishes in the streets.  A number of battles occurred in the slums and at the bar across the street.

There was one famous skirmish inside a warehouse.  My SS Officer alerted me that the resistance had holed up inside the building, popping shots off at patrolling Nazis.  I gave him permission to assault the warehouse.  During that time, I met a guy RPing as a doctor.  He healed me during a assassination attempt, so I paid him well and kept him close.  He also acted as a spy for me, reporting from the battlefield of the opposition.  I began to trust him, allowing him inside meetings with the High Command.

The leader of this opposition, as far as I knew, was a man by the name of, "The Bastard" (Not his actual name but close.  I don't wanna give anyone unwanted attention.)

The Bastard used shady and rule-breaking tactics to try and get at me.   Unfortunately, it was effective and he managed to gather a number of followers.  There's a "New Life Rule" that everyone is supposed to follow, and he broke it a number of times.  I recall a time where he was imprisoned and one of my guards, against my orders, executed him.  He spawned back in jail, and in good faith I had him released.  He was still in the Reichstag when this happened, and drew his gun the moment he was able.  This led to him being gunned down by 6 of my men, again...

After a while, The Bastard began to get closer and closer towards the Reichstag.  I got reports of opposition right outside The Reichstag as well as rumors of a distraction attack to lure troops away.  Bastard's final push got the best of me though.  I had mistakenly allowed a man, who I foolishly assumed was another Gestapo agent, to breach my inner circle.  He let the resistance in, and I holed myself up in my office with a small group of troops, my doctor, and a personal friend whom I had made on the server.  We three hid in the corner as my troops fought with the overwhelming opposition, but they eventually broke through and killed us all.

So ended my rule as Hitler.  I may go back to owning a Soviet Spy base disguised as a bar.

---tl'dr Played as Hitler in a WW2 RP mod, ran things as a legit leader.  Gave speeches, issued orders and initiated lockdowns.  Eventually killed by resistance.  One of the best gaming times of my life.---


QUICK NOTE:

To those asking for the Server name or IP address, I'd rather not give it out.  I don't have any permission by the admins to plug the server, and I'd rather not give them a reason to handle a wave of people joining all at once.  It might mess with whatever jive they got going.  If you really want to know, just go looking for it on the GMod server listing.  Sorry! ^^

<TITLE> GTA V focusing on the duo dynamic of Breaking Bad? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-08-29 04:47:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We've noticed how two prominent main characters have been featured in the media released for GTA V.  There's been the older, grey haired guy, who seems to be already well off in his criminal enterprise that he can afford to spend time with his family(Hopefully).

And then we have the Latin/Black character we have seen running from the cops, driving fancy cars, etc.  He seems like an upstart in the criminal world.  Possibly lowest denominator: Pusher, stick up man, thief, etc.  

Could GTA V be creating a due eerily similar of the one in Breaking Bad?

It would be hard to say Breaking Bad hasn't made an impact on modern crime drama.  The emmys behind it tell true of the popularity and success the franchise has garnered.  It might be safe to assume that Rockstar is taking a heavy influence from this success, using this dynamic to a advantage, familiarity from modern crime fans.  

I don't want to sat GTA V will be a rip off of Breaking Bad, but it seems possible the influence is there.  How would you guys feel about that? </TEXT>

<TEXT> -Rules-

1. Song can't be a song written about Slenderman.  I'm mainly looking for songs that have the same atmospheric mood or feel to the monster.

2. Try to keep it 1 song per post.

3. Describe why you think the song fits.

Here's Mine:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaXa9V0nLBE

For some reason now, whenever I hear this song I think Slenderman.  I think its mostly because of the use of static and creepy sounds.  It feels very Slender like.  Plus, a lot of the lyrics, while not about Slendy, have a creepy connection with him:

Like it was a friend.
It is watching us,

And the sky is filled with light
Can you see it?
All the black is really white
If you believe it

Anyway, there's my example.  I'm excited to see everyone's songs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure, it had it's flaws and stuff, and both games had God Awful endings, but I really enjoyed both games, especially when playing split-screen co-op.

I feel like this game series gets a lot of flak because the Jeff Gerstmann incident, and it sucks that IO Interactive gets blamed for the firing when even Jeff himself says they weren't the ones to blame.  Hell, even Jeff kinda like K L 2.  

I find it rare that games let you play as a genuine bad guy.  Sure, GTA IV lets you play the bad guy, but most of the time the main character in GTA games has a moral compass and will act good when the player acts bad. "Sorry!"

Its interesting to play a pair of despicable characters.  Characters that have nearly NO redeeming qualities to them.  Plus I loved K L 2's visual style. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Most would immediately jump to Stannis and Dany for obvious reasons, but recently I've found, thanks to people on Reddit, two more possible contenders.

"When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone."

Now, one user on GoT reddit mentioned that the banner of the man the giant killed at the end of DWD was a red star.  Jon would be surrounded by salt when he is stabbed by the tears shed by the other brothers.  The wound that Jon wretches the dagger from is also "smoking' from Jon's description.  

The other contender would be Victarion.  Now, when Victarion receives his wound to a hand a red priest fixes it.  Victarion is described by having a smoking hand, and being that he is a Greyjoy it would be easy to assume the 'salt' is in reference to the sea.  The Red Star bleeding could be a reference to his wound or some past kill, I'm not sure on that end.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In case some of you didn't know, the people behind Game of Thrones shot two first episodes.  1 was a pitch episode (Pilot) and the other was a reshoot that fit in canon/casting with the rest of the series.  They mention the pilot a few times in the audio commentary, including the fact that some footage from the pilot is actually in the reshoot.  That's why some character's hair doesn't match.  One of the big changes apparently was a casting change of Cat Stark.

I personally wouldn't mind seeing the original Cat, puls other changes they may or may not have made.  Would you guys wanna see it? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Hey Reddit!  Lets fix the History Channel with some awesome show ideas. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-03-22 07:50:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Ok, so we all know History Channel sucks balls now.  But I think there are PLENTY of ideas for History Channel shows that could be successful.  I understand that they are trying to push their reality TV programming, so a lot of those ideas will have that in mind.  Thats what this thread is about  

LETS FIX HISTORY CHANNEL

The ideas start here:


	I like the idea of Full Metal Jousting, but the whole tough guy element behind it is so incredibly stupid.  I think audiences would like it more if the people in the jousts were actually roleplaying as people from history.  That way, each jouster could get a small blurp about what impact they had during the medieval time period.  You could also set up betting and host the whole thing in Las Vegas, make a spectacle out of it.  The betters could even roleplay as kings, dukes and queens.


	Speaking of roleplay and reality TV, there could be an entire show about the decisions of powerful leaders.  You take a contestant and give him a job as a famous real life King, General, Religious Leader, anything  And you give the contestant problems that the actual figures really faced.  These may be comical every man kind of people, some people who dont know anything about history, or intelligent people involved in the community.  The point of the exercise would be to show how some of the most powerful people in history may not have been suitable for the job, or it could show how history could have possibly changed for better or worse depending on the decisions made by the contestants.


	Castle Life: Reality TV show based around the idea of following around people who are roleplaying as people living in medieval times.  Blacksmiths, ladies, bards, kings, lords, etc...  Each contestant would be proficient in their specified field, like a modern blacksmith or steel worker would be given a job as an old time black smith.  Or a modern politician would be given a job as a lord.  The twist would be in seeing how those modern influences would affect the old timey limitations.  The blacksmith wouldnt have his modern technology; the Lord would have more power, etc etc.


	Music show: Basically, the idea behind this one is that you take a modern band/artist in music, say Lady Gaga.  You tell Lady Gaga that she has to draw from a hat.  The hat contains musical genres and music types from the past.  They could vary from the tribal beats of Native America to 1950s rock and roll.  They would then have to write, produce and eventually perform a song meant for that period.  The catch would be that they can only use the equipment, technology and tropes from that era.  Lady Gaga couldnt write about Judas if she drew Native American song, seeing how Natives werent exposed to Christianity until the Europeans came over.


	Trials from History: Participants would reenact famous trials from history.  Salem Witch Trials, murder trials, etc.  We replace either lawyers, jury or judges with real people to see what their take on the event would be.  They could take the OJ trial and redo it, see if they could convict him with a different prosecution.  While this is happening, the audience can learn about the actual trial and see how it would have played differently due to minor changes.

Those are just a few.  Let me know what you think Reddit.

<TITLE> Niko Bellic is the the most depraved, violent, and insane character of the GTA Games.  And you shouldn't like him... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-02-11 09:43:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Since GTA V was announced a while back, I have been scouring the internet for any and all information regarding the game.  Since no one knows anything about the game save what we can speculate from the trailer, most of what I found was bullshit.  Then I stumbled upon a video by The Escapists Jim Sterling. (Link: http://www.destructoid.com/the-jimquisition-will-grand-theft-auto-v-have-no-balls--215360.phtml ) The video was mainly about how GTA IV and Saints Rows tones needed to be separate so they can be enjoyed by both fans of the realistic and balls-out crazy.  A notion I agree with.  But as Jim continued, I couldnt help but wince at how he viewed the main character Niko Bellic as a, Noble immigrant trying to do the right thing. Ok  Am I the only one who thinks Niko is the most despicable, psychotic and contradicting protagonist in the entire GTA series?

Let me explain.  GTA IVs story was very well told, an interweaving plot that separated into 3 titles within the universe that created this vast, interesting setting with deep characters.  Niko is probably one of the deepest, but I keep reading about how fans think of him as the most likeable protagonist.  Really?  This guy is their hero?  Hell, Cole Phelps was a dork of a character, but at least he had some moral fortitude.  Niko doesn't have that.  He and the people who like him may say he does, but I seriously doubt it.  Let's put this into perspective.

What do we know about GTAs main characters?  Most have a criminal past, a conflict that drives them forward.  You look at Claude for example.  He was a stick up man and was in love with a psychotic woman by the name of Catalina.  Tommy was in prison before the events of Vice City.  CJ was doing petty stick ups and car jackings in Liberty City.  What was Niko doing?  Human trafficking.  Maybe I am alone here, but human trafficking is one of the most deplorable acts a human being can commit.  Its up there with rape because you are embedding in eventual rape.  Niko was also part of the Yugoslav wars.  A war where there was no real good guy.  Both sides of that war partook in Ethnic Cleansing and a little something called, Rape Camps. He was also on the Serbian side, the side that takes most the blame in that war.  And no offense to Serbians, but a lot seem to have this mentality that they were doing heroic deeds during that war.  Right...  I hope you as a reader have enough knowledge of Wikipedia to search what I'm talking about.

But so what?  I mean, everyone has a past right?  Why should I judge Niko as a character about his past, GTA IV is about the present!  Well, not really.  As I played GTA IV I began to see Nikos heritage and past start to creep out from behind the veil of his character.  What do we know about Niko?  Well, he is very critical of Liberty City.  We see his distaste for everything American as soon as he steps off the boat.  In a way, he sees Liberty Citys denizens as terrible people.  Trash even.  I was always confused when I took Niko on a rampage, because the way Rockstar has written him, his noble attitude wouldnt allow him to gun down civilians in the street.  But we can  The direct actions of the player can contradict the story and characters written for us, which I think is one of the most terrible things someone can do in video game story telling.  But I began to look at it on a deeper level.  I began to think back on Nikos past and how he views America and its people.  It all became sensible when I began to see Niko as just Ethnic Cleansing.  By God, Rockstar hasnt created a noble immigrant, theyve created a monster.

But what about all these friends Niko surrounds himself with?  Roman, Little Jacob, and Packie can't all abide by Niko's way.  Someone has to speak up.  Actually, someone does.  Frequently.  Most of Roman's dialogue is trying to convince his cousin to stop what he's doing.  He pleads with his cousin, in this nervously-joking manner, that he can stop his crime-fueled lifestyle and live a life or normalcy.  Niko doesn't listen, but it does paint a sort of picture about where Niko's loyalties lie.  They lie with the American dollar and revenge.  If you think about each character from the past GTAs, none of them tried to hold a protagonist back.  CJ's family was fine with the way Carl was, all they wanted to do was take back the Grove.  Tommy's lawyer Ken Rosenberg was similar to Roman in his nervous attitude, but he was mainly scared of the actions of people against him rather than Tommy.  Claude had no connections at the start of the game, so his path was a blank slate to leave open for the player.  When you see Roman and Niko together, you get a sense that Roman is only sticking by him because he's family.  The moment Niko yelled at Roman for the condition of the shitty apartment they had to flee to after Niko had gotten Roman's apartment and business burnt down, I lost all respect for him as a character.

I don't think this was Rockstar's intent at all, but there's this layer of subtext that I can't help but feeling was placed there intentionally.  Niko Bellic has all these traits, and we're supposed to not question them?  By the end of the game, Niko is a wrecked shell of a human being.  Nothing makes sense for him anymore once Roman/Kate dies, so he seems to wander the city, killing what people he can.  Sure you can bring friends on the normal outing routines, but they never bring up those who were lost.  It's like they know if they go down that road they may push Niko off the deep end.  Maybe I'm looking too much into this, but honestly there's a reason why I left GTA IV depressed and left the other games with a sense of wicked pride.  Niko's actions and yours led to the ultimate downfall of his sanity to a point where there's nothing in his life for him anymore.

tl'dr Niko Bellic is a terrible person, and you should feel bad for liking him.

<TEXT> Ya know, when I see footage of mothers dressing up their children in "God hates Fags" clothing, and holding up signs, it all seems very close to emotional child abuse.  I know very little of law, but one could probably argue in court that displaying children in this negative fashion would constitute as emotional child abuse.  I could see this being used as a weapon to try and quell some of these parents that think they are infallible, as well as removing children of this hate-spewing environment.

I could see the inherit wrongness of removing said child from parents though.  A child without parental guidance must be a scary thing, but perhaps it could do some good.  I'm sure it would shake up the congregation of the church.  Many probably wouldn't be so willing to go out and protest with the possibility of their children being taken away.

<TITLE> Why Skyrim is my GOTY. *Lots of SPOILERS* </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-11-17 05:04:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I hated the Imperials.  I had never played a Elder Scrolls game before this one, so my character was as fond of the imperials as they were presented.  I knew nothing of the lands, people and factions of Skyrim, and I didn't care.  These Romanesque men were about to kill me for something that was obviously no fault of my own.  Damn the Imperials and damn the Empire, I thought, leaving that horrid cave with blade and Ralof in tow.

One of my first thoughts after being freed from my bonds was to teach these vile dictators a lesson.  The Stormcloaks seemed to be the ones doing the teaching, so I made my way to Windhelm.  I was eager to pick up my blade for the good fight, teach those empowering men how the sharp steel of the Nord's feels.  When I arrived at the city, I was greeted with a aspect of real life I did not expect.  Bitter racism towards the Dark Elves.  I looked on in disbelief as the people of Windhelm threatened a poor Eleven girl with violence and rape.  This must be the times, I thought.  Tensions are high, Nords are looking for someone to blame.  I figured the Jarl I had grown to admire would not be so distasteful...

I was wrong of course.  Bringing Skyrim back to the Nords meant freeing it from these immigrants.  I reluctantly chose to join their army regardless, my eagerness within dialogue choices making me somewhat wary.  My character was given two choices.  A resounding 'Hell yeah!' and a 'No.'  I had never known a Bethesda game to be so narrow within choice, giving me such a black and white answer to a matter that was entirely grey.  When I joined, I was given my first few set of missions.  One was to bring a Axe to the Jarl of Whiterun, a good friend whom I protected from a dragon.  I respected the man, a man who teetered between sides, but obviously thought of his people first.

When I arrived, I presented the axe to Balgruuf, hoping to see him to come to a conclusion that favored the Stormcloaks.  He rejected the offering, an act which I knew would lead Ulfric to war.  I fretted this, trying desperately to look for a dialogue option to try to sway the Jarl to Ulfric's side.  There was none.

As I made my way back, I thought of all the options my character would have to stop this push for Whiterun, how my character would make him see through reason.  If my persuade check failed, damn it all I would reload a save.  Roleplay be damned.  When I arrived at Ulfric's side, I was shocked to find no such dialogue option available.  My new soldier of the Stormcloak army followed Ulfric blindly, eager to take Whiterun as much as I.

The battle was ferocious, my character slaying man after man of the Whiterun guard, men pleading with their lives, men who cheered me on when I absorbed the soul of a dragon, who eagerly egged me on to hear the shout of the Dragonborn.  I had betrayed them...  As the city fell, Balgruff surrendered and gave his position away.  He was banished from his kingdom, but not before he gave me a look of complete anger and disgust, offering, "This is not over..." I shuddered at his words, feeling guilty at what actions I had taken.

During the next few campaigns I began to embrace the warrior's life with more vigil.  Ralof was with me, and we fought in many battles together.  We both had stories to tell, and Ralof even admitted the idea of coming to a truce with the Imperials.  This surprised me.  Ralof, a man of honor who was so willing to die for Ulfric the moment he met him was having doubts.  My character had nothing to say in the matter, a blind soldier sympathetic to the cause.

Skyrim is many things.  A game in which you battle Dragons, Giants and Bandits.  It has a simple idea behind it, and it by no means is original.  Yet, no other game has stirred the morality of a soldier's life within me before.  All those Call of Duty games or Brothers in Arms titles never made me feel this.  This moral thought within my mind: Is what I'm doing for the greater good?  I betrayed a friend, killed countless men and even brought a peaceful city to its knees.  What was I doing?  It was my full intention to play my Nord character as a good man.

Later, I was imprisoned within Markarth on a mission to bribe a Squire to sympathize with our cause.  I eventually broke out with the help of the Forsworn.  I had to commit a murder of a innocent man to do it, his cries filling the mines as I brought a shiv down into his flesh.  But by then, murder was the least of my troubles.  Despite this, on my way out, I learned that the Forsworn were the true natives of Skyrim and that the Nords just moved in and took the land.  Ulfric Stormcloak was one of these men...

By Talos, what have I done...
