<TEXT> Bs. There had been insurgence in the pass years where it was evident that our soldiers have lack of training. Shit strategy.

Nakaumpok lang sa sulok ni wala man lang strategy. Di din makuha sa tapang halatang takot. Exposed yung gunner tapos sya lang nakasuot ng head gear-outdated pa.

Iirc there were 10 men on that unit yet it was less effective than say a smaller unit of 4 with proper training. If all were equipped properly, say 1 with MG(SAW), sniper and 2 with m4 or even just updated m16s, it would have been more effective.

Ang nangyayari yung iba nagtatago sa likod ng kasama nila tapos yung pinakaharap babaril nalang sa kawalan, no look kasi nagtatago din sa wall.

I gotta admit that it's getting slightly better with gear and training but really the president shouldn't blabber about shit like that. </TEXT>

Ive only ever seen a hummingbird once. My mom grows a lot of flowers and we often get beesitors. One time this hummingbird visited her garden while me and my cousins were playing by the porch. I told my cousins and all of us stopped playing just to watch that magnificent creature. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ive been running too for the past couple of months in preparation for my military PFT. Here's 2 things that greatly changed my running.

1. Inhaling through the nose and and exhale through my mouth

2. Finding the correct music that matches my rhythm. For the first 6 weeks ive been listening really upbeat songs; mostly hiphop and while my speed had been improving, it always feels difficult to reach my goal(run 3mi in sub-18minutes). Then i listened to gorillaz' clint eastwood. Suddenly after 3mi was comfortable to run. To which i extended my distance to 5mi.

Hopefully you'll find your rhythm as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The stag is very symbolic. The thing i like about it the most is how it transitioned to hannibal wendigo. Gave me goosebumps as it was both awesome and creepy at the same time. It's amazing how they portrayed the psychology of the characters(or at least Will and Hannibal) using magickal symbols. 

As for the human totem.. aggh! it's definitely one of my top 3 favourites along with the mushroom garden. </TEXT>

Coquilles is my favourite episode from the series when it comes to the aethetics. I think the cinematography is brilliant.


Question: What's your favourite sculpture/installation in the series? What is your design?


Also, I hope it gets renewed soon! </TEXT>

We're also considering changing to a better kit if the turbo is faulty.

<TEXT> Im also preparing for a PFT(for sf) and this is how im going about it.

I know youre only asking about situps but since there's plenty of answers already, i'll talk about the entire fitness test.

Train every other day AT LEAST since you have very short time to prepare.

Increase your situps by 4-5 counts each time.

Focus your energy on the going UP part and try not to slowly go down but not too fast that you'll lose the momentum. This way you'll conserve energy.

Go beyond the passing count

Im guessing there's a series of tests; running, push up, sit ups, pullups(prolly not this one). Train your body imitating the ORDER of which the tests are gonna go. This will give your body an optimal muscle memory.

Lastly, and this significantly improved my training. Watch your DIET. If you're used to eating a lot, that's okay. No need to decrease the amount since youre used to it already anyway but try not to ingest too much fatty food. Substitute this with something like apple which is a great source of carbs-helps with endurance.

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had been through something similar. In fact im still going through it right now. 2 years ago i applied for a fashion degree in london at one of the-if not the best fashion uni in the world. Through out the process my family was very supportive. When i finally got in, they basically just stopped supporting. I don't know if they thought i wouldnt get in or something but it was just so unfair. I already poured in all of my savings to it, through the application, housing, tuition fee deposit, all because i believed they would help me. Then suddenly they wont. Why did they have to wait till it's very late?

It was my dream and to me it was the greatest achievement ive ever got and for it to be shattered... They even went so far as to dismiss it as if it was nothing.

It feels like death, maybe even worse--to have a dream snagged off of you like that. Its been 2 years and I still cant get over it. Anything i do comes second rate. Ive lost my sense of purpose for a while.

Every family gathering/meeting has been difficult for me. I have had terrible anxiety attacks(i hope it doesnt happen to you). Im only getting back up lately and im trying so hard to work so that one day i can go to that uni, preferably without my family's help.

Ive avoided some of my friends for a while out of embarrassment. I shouldnt have. They were the ones that gave me strenght to get over it somehow. Talk to your friends, maybe talk to your husband about it as well.

As for your mother and sister, i hope they would just admit to it. It may not give you closure but maybe it would help in the process.

Ill stop here for now. </TEXT>

A number with infinite repeating decimal such as 1.6666666... Is rational becauce it can be expressed in ratio or fractions. 1.66666... Is simply 1 1/3

This works on smaller devices but it might need a second opinion.

Personally i would use a mixer or if you can buy or build a box with some sort of selector to it, that would be safer and cheaper. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I own 2 leicas. Altho both of them are pretty vintage; m2 and an m6 ttl 0.85x. The last time i used a digital camera besides my phone was 2011 iirc. Went full film after discovering the ease of using rangefinders, super quick focusing and that little surprise of not seeing them right after you take the shot. Film's not dead...

<TEXT> Yess! I love the vintage styling of rangefinders. Fortunately leica still makes them this way altho they're very expensive compared to other cameras.

This camera in particular has a collapsible lens which can be hidden within the body when not being used making it pocketable. It's simply brilliant. </TEXT>

Whats funny is i never knew it was called factorial till last week.

<TEXT> An uncle of mine was inquiring for granite prices to use for their multimillion dollar house. My dad and his brothers always dressed modestly. Some basic shirt, jeans and sometimes just flip flops. Often times, except for really important and official occasions, the driver and bodyguards are better dressed than them. So he was asking the store lady about the price of their mid-tier granite products as he is planning to buy loads of slabs for his house. The lady laughs at him thinking it was some sort of a prank and was waiting for the better dressed guy(driver) to ask them personally. Driver approaches and tells the lady that she was talking to his boss, and that he'd like to talk to her manager.

Uncle talking to the manager tells how much granite he wants, and instead of the mid-tier products he'd like to go for the best kind of granite they can offer.

The saleslady apologised several times before she was sent to some office.

He literally ordered trucks of them. So much that by the time they arrived to the construction site 400km away, the bed of the semis were slightly bent. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm in a somewhat similar situation. I was the brilliant kid in high school, and now it's just nothing.

Last year was the highlight of my life, but also the lowest of the low.

I finally got accepted to the best uni for the course I wanted. Put in everything. I was doing pretty well with an online trading business but I poured it all in, my capital, every profit I've earned, savings and all, but it wasn't enough. I needed the support of my family but it wasn't the degree they wanted for me. That degree? I dropped out of.

This got me really frustrated which lead to break up, and losing most of my friends. Frustration turning into depression. I chose alcohol and smoking as a coping mechanism. That went on for a while but now it's just smoking. The only time I feel really happy is when I'm doing collabs and commissions. I hate to admit it to anyone but really I'm stuck on a dead end, barricaded by the pile of ambitions I have that's seemingly impossible to vault. </TEXT>

A dvd of whatever video your family likes to watch or a personal message so as to keep them engaged. Edit the vid so that the sound get lower and lower gradually to the point that it gets almost inaudible. This will prompt them to raise the volume.

<TEXT> We're similar in many aspects. However I have a defense mechanism for this sort of situation.

Anyway, to share an example.
Taong bahay din ako. People in our barangay are familiar with my face tho I only talk to a handful of my neighbours and some occasional vendors.

I often walk by this street, calmly, and just like you, I don't really expect anything to happen. Then these two teenagers started teasing me, "Ooh pogi daw siya oh. Pogi daw oh" in an irritating manner. Yung alam mong nang-aasar.

Initially I tried to ignore it but since they kept on going, I paced slower--waited for them to pass by and once they were in front of me, I asked them, "Anong sabi nyo?" "Trip nyo ko?" I must have said it in a really scary way cause that shut em up good(Both of them were bigger than me).

I kept walking and I wanted to keep walking but at that point I was thinking, they prolly do that to anyone smaller than them. So I turned back I realised they weren't moving. Apparently they were in front of their house already but was hesitant to enter. I waited anyway and just as they entered, I voiced the house number, "949, tatandaan ko yan." then left.

Admittedly, I was already pretty pissed before that incident.

Anyway man, You have to confront him if ignoring doesnt work. Else, tambay ka lang sa tindahan, food trip hanggang matapos sila, saka mo sundan! joookes </TEXT>

Dad was willing to give his land but grandma said, if he allowed it to happen, my uncle will just do it again on the other lands.

My uncle then decided to berate my father. He said terrible things despite knowing that dad couldn't take intense emotions due to illness. The one thing that really made me wanna do it tho was when he said, "Fine, I'll leave just enough way for your hearse to get through"

<TEXT> I guess I'm a little late for this but I've been wanting to post this.
Last year I decided to apply to some top art/fashion university. Was on leave of absence on my current school prior to this. The reason being, I'm burned out since it was a course I'm not really interested in and I felt like I'm not learning anything new anymore so I thought I'd work a while.

Anyway, Last year I started processing my application, also worked on developing my portfolio. I understand form very well but I have very little experience in constructing clothes myself. Because of this I decided to leave my office part time job and focus on my business instead--buying and selling macs.

Processing was going alright, submitted my portfolio, and then it was time to wait for the results!

I have been open to my friends and specially my family about this. I was well aware at this point that I wouldn't be able to support myself with my money but some family said they'd help.

Then I got the results. I got in to Central Saint Martins!!! I couldn't believe it! I was a block away from the house when I got the results and I couldn't contain the joy. I was running, jumping, on my way home, couldn't wait to tell my girlfriend, my parents, my friends, the good news. I was one of the happiest moments of my life.

Now, having done the hard part, it's time to work on accommodations, tickets, and most importantly, VISA.

So paying for these hurt my business a lot. And I must admit it's something that I've overlooked. It wasn't long until I had to use my capital too. "Don't matter, my uncle will help me," I thought. Finally, I had to take care of my tuition fee and VISA. They require us to pay for the tuition for the entire year, as for the visa, a huuge chunk of money is required for maintenance. Overall I needed 30,000GBP.

A little background to my aunt and uncle. They're pretty well off. They're known to be very helpful, esp, financially, but never to that scale. But also, they kinda don't believe in art. I personally think of my aunt as sort of a dream killer; her kids were forced to take degrees that they didn't like.

At first my aunt and uncle sounded like they would help. They asked for a breakdown of expenses. The next time we talked I gave them, then my aunt asked for printed docs after I've explained to her everything. Fair enough, I've printed hundreds of pages, brought them to her and finally she told me, "you couldn't even finish your course here. how are you gonna finish your studies there?"

I understand that it was my fault too. I just wished they said "no" earlier.

I'm practically broke now, my savings gone, feeling lost, and is becoming somewhat self destructive.
Edit: Since we have different school systems in the UK. I had to dropout off my college </TEXT>

<TEXT> Happened during college. On an humanities(?) class, we had a photography project and the professor wasn't clear about the submission. This lead to a couple of my classmates submitting later than everyone. However, based on his instructions, (I can't remember exactly) they are technically on time.
He rejected their projects and I couldn't help but argue with his decision. I tried to tell him calmly that he should reconsider since it wasn't very clear. He started to raise his voice and tried to turn the whole class against me.
The argument ended when he asked the 2 students if he was right to reject their projects. They nodded. Pussies

The rest of the term was hell. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Worked with stunningly beutiful people and there's an entire spectrum of them as there is for everything. I know one in particular who had a terrible childhood, grew up to be extremely kind but would snap to a total psycho. Another one was both beaut and smart but is completely unaware of her beauty. I wouldn't say I got bored. After a while they became like everybody else, like I got immune to their physical charm.  </TEXT>
