<TEXT> The study was as long or longer than previous research. 

The mice only live a year or so, so that was a significant portion of their life. 


One of the measures of lung damage was (statistically) the same between the VG (based e-juice) and tobacco exposures. These were significantly different to control (non smoking) and PG based e-juices.

<TEXT> This comment is pretty much spot on. It sounds like the ACCC argued that when used as intended then the seller's claims are wrong. E-cigs are basically an evaporation condensation aerosol generator. So the thermal processes that occur are slightly similar to smoking. And produce similar compounds - albeit at much, much lower levels. 
If you had a purely mechanical (e.g. compressed air powered) nebuliser for e-juice you wouldn't get these chemicals.  </TEXT>

The scale is pretty coarse, however you can see that 1m wouldn't do a lot, in an average sense, however it would make a huge difference to damage during storm surges or high winds. 

Most/all properties would be high enough, however a lot of roads would probably need to be raised or redirected - otherwise they would be inundated by tidal flooding.

At 20m sea level rise I will have a waterfront property :). I guess my home site is future proofed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why would some of the biggest companies in the world invest in competition? It's easier for them to wait until someone else figures it out, continue burning that cheap cheap fossil fuel, and buy out the tech later. 

Maybe not in the US, but many fuel companies are invested in biofuels. Most current diesel fuel sold around the world contains 5-10% biodiesel. This is mainly because the production of modern low sulfur fuel damages the lubricity of the fuel, and biodiesel is often the cheapest additive to bring it back up to spec. 

EDIT: However that biofuel is usually from crops or crop waste (canola for diesel and corn/sugar cane/beets for ethanol) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks u/Somnif, this and below is an excellent summary of the general field and the specific issues with algal biofuels.

I have dabbled in algal biofuel research and have a large project looking at biofuel emissions (when used in diesel engines).

Even with the advances in this paper the economics are a long way off. The lowest cost approach I have seen with algae is to use local saline species in open pond systems in areas of the coast which are too arid to support agriculture. 

Even then - fuel is usually the lowest value product you can get algae to grow. There are already large algae farms for pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications.  </TEXT>

If YOU'D have bothered to read the article posted, rather than dismiss it as an industry shill because you didnt LIKE what it said, you'd see that the IARC drew conclusions from studies that the study author's themselves disagreed with.

No need to shout. If **you** however had read my post properly above where I mentioned meta analysis you would understand how that is possible.

 Again with the activist bullshit. Anyone who disagrees with your narrative and conclusions is automatically an industry shill. 

I am a scientist (and farmer), not an activist. Please don't insult me. 

I was not referring to Iida. I have made no comment about her. My comments have been referring to the other blog she linked to (David / The Risk Monger) - who from his bio has worked/works as an industry lobbyist and consultant. That of course does not preclude him from having a valid opinion, but opinion is not science and science is not opinion.

This is really like the climate change issue. Who should we believe, the huge body of impartial scientists, or the other group - oil companies, politicians, bloggers with undisclosed conflicts of interest.  I guess you are on the side of the oil companies there too???

<TEXT>  You're no different.

Sorry but I am. As a (part time) farmer who uses glyphosate, I would be happy if someone can prove it is not carcinogenic in humans. It would be convenient to bury my head in the sand but that would be pointless. Instead I minimize my use of glyphosate and wear proper PPE. 

The best cancer experts around the world have reviewed the data (including your reams of research). How about you read the actual report and tell me what is wrong - instead of blogs written by industry shills.   

http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol112/mono112-10.pdf

The IARC themselves say:
6.1 Cancer in humans
There is limited evidence in humans for the
carcinogenicity of glyphosate. A positive association
has been observed for non-Hodgkin
lymphoma.

The person I know is a scientist who is not a member of the IARC board, however has sat on some panels within their field of scientific expertise.  

 It just very convenient that a lot of industry led research happens to get thrown out by their standards then. Research that stands up to peer review.

Which research are you referring to?

 That's gotta be the shittiest argument to not take someone seriously i've ever seen.

If you read my post I wasn't using that to critique his work. I was using that as evidence of bias. If you read the blog post it is full of glib/BS statements like:

 For the record, IARC considers sunlight as a known carcinogen (Category 1) but I dont see regulators banning people from going outside.

Which is clearly a strawman argument. 

I don't have the time to go through everything that is wrong with the blog line by line. 

By the sound of it your mind is made up and there in nothing that could persuade you. At the end of the day, it comes down to who should you believe. A bunch of impartial scientists who conduct their study in open session using well defined methods that are decided at the outset. Of the industry making money from glyphosate sales.

<TEXT> You misunderstand the process. The IARC do not form an opinion, then see which studies agree with it. That would be cherrypicking. Rather what the IARC do is what is known in science as a meta-analysis. The look at **all** studies which meet their **inclusion/exclusion criteria**. These criteria do not change between panels, and are **based on quality of the study, not the findings**. Their deliberations are open and their methods are clearly published beforehand. AFAIK most of the studies they excluded were funded by the industry and wouldn't have made it through the peer review process of a decent journal - either due to flawed methods, incomplete data/methods or undue conflict of interest.   

Its biased because.....it reinforces its claims with a link to a blog that seems biased to you? Care to expound on that?

Sure - the bio on the blog states:

David believes that hunger, AIDS and diseases like malaria are the real threats to humanity - not plastics, GMOs or pesticides.  

This suggests he holds biases. He may be right in his views, but belief has no place in science, so he is clearly not a scientist. 

A colleague (friend) of yours was on the panel. I'm to understand you have a favorable view of the panel because you know someone on it? That's meaningless on my end.

Colleague, not friend. I am basing my comments on the rigour of the IARC process. As a scientist/engineer by day job I trust the process is sound and not driven by agenda beliefs on either side. 

EDIT: 

I agree completely with the comments and critiques that the list does not give relative risk. i.e. bacon, salted fish and uranium are all on the list, but the dose required to give an average person cancer would vary widely between them. AFAIK they are thinking of moving to a relative risk approach which would make more sense. 

There are also statements in the blogs that some of the findings have not been supported by authors of individual papers included. This is the whole point of a meta analysis. By combining studies you add statistical power beyond any one study (the whole is greater than the sum of the parts).

The IARC look at 

*evidence of cancer in animal studies
*mechanism of action (how the agent causes cancer) - and confirmation that the same mechanism exists in humans
*evidence of cancer in human studies


Class 1 needs to demonstrate all of the above conclusively. It is possible that in the future a larger body of rigorous studies may downgrade glyphosate on the IARC list. However I recall the animal data was pretty conclusive. 


Note that the biggest concern is farmers (and their families). So even if you don't agree with the findings, make sure your PPE and cabin air filters are up to scratch. Just in case the IARC turn out to be right after all.  


TL;DR: 

The process the IARC use is fixed and does not change between studies. We don't see any serious disagreement with their findings on tobacco smoke or excess sun exposure (causing skin cancer).

<TEXT> It is well written but somewhat biased. 

e.g. they mention the research that was excluded by the IARC - with a link to another (seemingly) very biased blog. The IARC have a policy of not including research where the methods and/or conflict(s) of interest are not properly disclosed - i.e. they only include good quality, unbiased research. 

One of my colleagues (in my day job) was on the panel. I don't doubt the IARC assessment. 

She is however right that the classification doesn't assess risk. 

However I will continue to use it on the farm, but with very good PPE/controls. Don't forget that diesel exhaust is class 1!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> To add to the above, the best way to save money would be to buy a reasonably priced older car (e.g. $2k) and maintain it yourself to make sure it lasts as long as possible, rather than just drive it into the ground without maintenance.
 
Do your research and buy a car that is known to be reliable (e.g. most honda / mazda / subaru).

Learn how to check a car - oil / coolant / brakes / etc... so you can look for signs of how well it has been maintained.

Manual transmissions (if you can drive one) generally last longer and use less fuel than automatics. 

Most of the cost of car maintenance is labor. However most car maintenance is very easy to learn and can be done with a few basic tools. There are lots of online forums and youtube videos that can show you how.

My cars range from 1966-2009. None of them have been anywhere near a mechanic in the time I have owned them. I have owned one for 24 years. I would spend less on maintenance in a year than most people who only maintain one car using a mechanic.

It could be a teacher I had for chemistry and maths. In chemistry class she would get us to read the text book in silence for most of the lesson so she could work on assignments for her M.Ed. degree. 

In advanced maths she was beyond her level of ability. she would get stuck in the middle of problems and go and spend 5-10 mins trying to work out the solution. Once the head of the maths department walked in at one of those times and a student said "Sir, can you solve the equation, Miss can's do it". She went right off at him.
The sad part was as soon as she got her masters she got a job at a fancy private school. I pity them.

<TEXT> In approximate numbers you will be paying $21k p.a. just in interest on your student loan.
If you pay that down $100k that will reduce to $12k p.a.

Conversely, you could conservatively make around $12k p.a. by investing in shares, which would put you about $3k p.a. in front over the first option. 

However the share market can be volatile, so there is more risk with that option. 

There are also probably income tax liabilities for either option. So if you need to pay tax on the investment income it could cancel out the benefit.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have so many. I don't think I can single out just one.

But last year I had a student show a picture of a scantily clad female halfway through what was supposed to be a professional final year presentation. Given that the class was half female and a significant number were muslim this didn't go down well. 

Usually it is just boring stuff like people arguing that fundamental physics are incorrect - or there are loopholes.

I once had someone apply for credit - which was denied. They complained that our course fees were higher, so it was cheaper for them to go to another (lower grade) uni in the same city. I told them please do. They were shocked - they seemed to think I earned some sort of commission or salary based on student numbers.

<TEXT> In most of Germany they have separate bins for food waste - it is then composted.

In many parts of Australia there are green waste bins or green waste collections which are processed by mulch/fertiliser companies. Food waste still goes to landfill but the methane is usually captured for power generation.

The biggest issue in the US is not sending food waste to landfill, but rather the widespread usage of in-sink disposal units. This diverts food waste from a solid waste stream to liquid waste, which then takes a lot of extra energy and emissions to treat. I remember from back when I studied WWTP design, the proportion of insinkerators expected was an issue when designing the system.

Where I was, 90% majored in ecology or management and had a hard time finding work.

<TEXT> You should store wine so the cork is wet. If the cork dries out it will shrink and allow air to permeate, ruining the wine through oxidation.

"Corked" wine is not from contact between the wine and the cork, it is from contaminants in inferior cork getting into the wine. 

Stelvins and similar (non-cork) closures should be stored upright though.  </TEXT>

If you are wondering about the 0.5 lemon, it is a cumquat tree that has sprouted from the root stock (rough/bush lemon). They are not bad as lemons go, a bit similar to a meyer lemon, and can be peeled easily like a mandarin. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The monks welcome him and invite him to stay the night and dine with them. Part way through dinner, one of the monks stands up and yells out 56    the whole room bursts into laughter, but eventually resume eating their meal. Dave thinks this is strange, but doesnt know what to do about it. 5 minutes later, a different monk stands and calls out, 341, and everyone laughs and laughs, even more than before. This pattern of calling out numbers and laughter continues throughout the meal. Eventually Dave can no longer contain himself, so he quietly asks the monk next to him what is going on. The monk explains that they have all been living in seclusion so long they know each others jokes by heart (a bit like reddit). The monk suggests Dave try it  So Dave thinks up a number, stands up and says 72  and a deadly silence falls over the room not one person so much as smiles

Dave meekly sat down, and whispered to the monk next to him, what did I do wrong, was that an inappropriate joke for mealtimes, or a joke invented by someone who has died?. The monk replied, oh there was nothing wrong with the joke, it was just the way you told it.

2. Flying into downtown seattle in a seaplane, shortly after 911,  with no pre-boarding baggage or passport checks.

3. Drive through bank ATMs.

4. Mall of America is one of the biggest malls in the known universe but doesn't have anywhere that serves decent coffee (no, Starbucks and Caribou are not decent coffee).

5. No roundabouts

6. Most of you don't understand "fortnight"

7. The number of houses with flagpoles/flags.

8. Went offroading with some friends in CO. There were a bunch of guys parked at the trailhead drinking beer and blasting away with rifles. The ground was a carpet of beer cans and shells. They were blasting across the track, and only stopped about 6' before the first car passed and started again as soon as the last car was 3' past them. As soon as we got to the first hill there was not a beer can or shell casing to be found.

<TEXT>  The filament, a nickel-chromium wire, was coupled to a thicker copper wire coated with silver. The silver coating was sometimes missing. Four tin solder joints attached the wires to each other and coupled the copper/silver wire to the air tube and mouthpiece. All cartomizers had evidence of use before packaging (burn spots on the fibers and electrophoretic movement of fluid in the fibers). Fibers in two cartomizers had green deposits that contained copper.

<TEXT> It is well known in aerosol science/technology fields that the type of filament used in e-cig devices will slowly turn the filament into nanoparticles. They are termed a glowing wire aerosol generator, and have been used to generate well defined and very small nanoparticles for scientific applications for a long time now. 
A lot of seminal work on this has beendone by Christian Peineke http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021850206001133

<TEXT>  Vaporizers take a flavored liquid and convert it to a vapor that is inhaled.


Not quite, they do initially create a vapour around the filament, but what is inhaled is a liquid aerosol (a bunch of liquid "particles").
E-cig juice has a very low vapour pressure, so the amount of true "vapour" [vapor for Americans] you inhale is negligible.

EDIT: I have done lots of measurements of the particle size spectrum produced by e-cigs, using sophisticated aerosol spectrometers... </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are lots of houses/rooms/apartments to rent in East Victoria Park which is walking distance to Curtin and also to train/bus stations. Gumtree is probably the best place to look.
The rental market is pretty good for renters at the moment. Feel free to negotiate if you think the rent is too high. 
That said, finding "pet friendly" rental accomodation is a bit harder. You may be better off finding somewhere to rent first then asking your landlord about a dog later. If you are a good tenant they will be more willing to let you. 
There are lots of good restaurants along albany highway at (East) Victoria Park. Again a (long) walk or a short bus trip from Curtin. </TEXT>

FYI, New Zealand and Australian laws allow you to own firearms (including handguns), however you need to have a license/permit, you need to have a genuine reason (hunting / target shooting / professional), and it is difficult or impossible to own semi-automatic longarms unless you are a professional shooter.

<TEXT> Some information on Australian regulations to make things clearer. Anyone with a "genuine reason" can own A/B/H categories. The genuine reason could be target shooting at a range or club. Categories C and D are limited to professionals shooters and military/law enforcement.

 Category A: rimfire rifles, and single and double barrel shotguns. 
    
 Category B: single shot and repeating centre fire rifles. 

 Category C: semi automatic rimfire rifles with a magazine capacity no greater than 10 rounds; and semi automatic or pump action shotguns with a magazine capacity no greater than 5 rounds. 

 Category D: self-loading centre fire rifles. 

 Category H: handguns. 


 This system is stricter than that of a number of comparable countries. 

 First, and in contrast to the position in the United States, there is no legal right to gun ownership. Owning and using a firearm is limited in Australia to people who have a genuine reason and self-protection does not constitute a genuine reason to possess, own or use a firearm.

 Secondly, the Australian system requires both the licensing of individual shooters and the registration of each firearm. In contrast, countries such as New Zealand and Canada broadly speaking only require shooters to obtain a license, which enables them to freely purchase firearms appropriate to that licence.  </TEXT>

It is a myth that the real number of guns went down as a result of the buyback. About 650000 were destroyed, and Australia has since imported over 1 million. Many of the guns surrendered as part of the buyback were not being actively used or were even inactive. Most active shooters used the buyback money to buy more firearms.    </TEXT>

Modern gearboxes use synchromesh so that you don't need to match rpm for the gear you are changing into.

<TEXT> As others have said guns were never outlawed. Just semi autos and pump action shotguns (essentially).

Most serious shooters I knew (farmers/hunters) were unaffected as they didn't own anything subject to the buyback. Bolt action / DB shotguns, etc...

A few people I knew who owned guns for "personal protection" grumbled and/or ranted, but when they went to hand the guns in got more than they paid so were somewhat happy.
 
Most then used the buyback cash to buy more guns. I think the stats support that. The number of guns per individual went up after 1996. 

Anyone with a "genuine reason" can still get a gun quite easily in all parts of Australia.

<TEXT> This is essentially the right answer. 
If you are standing in a train carriage moving at a constant velocity and you jump up you will land back down in the same location within the carriage. This is because your velocity relative to the ground is the same as the train's, and you won't slow down significantly. 
If you are standing on an open flat bed, wind resistance will slow you down when you jump. How much will depend on the train's velocity and how high you jump (plus any additional wind speed - depending on the train's direction relative to the wind).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> From the question you could either be talking about moving outside the power band (see u/shokalion 's response) or hitting the rev limiter. 
Modern electronically controlled engines have an rpm limit (programmed into the computer) that you can't go past. So it definitely feels like "hitting a wall" if you accelerate to an RPM that high. 
But in most vehicles, you will notice either a moderate or severe drop in acceleration rate before you get to the rev limit, which could also be described as "hitting a wall".

You save money because you normally pay a premium price for boneless cuts. 
I don't have an answer to your direct question, but you can be sure that all meat that goes into dog food is classed as not fit for human consumption, so it would all otherwise go to waste. Chicken would likely have the lowest carbon footprint.
