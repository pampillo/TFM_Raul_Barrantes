<TEXT> There's something about how slick this whole scene is, even minus the 'matrixness' of it.


 The editing is spot on, just the right amount of cuts, the framing, and the camera is always in the perfect spot. You can see everything thats happening (something that bugs the hell out of me in other films) and its paced really nicely. 

Yes its not the longest or most intricate of duels, but its so silky smooth. </TEXT>

Its funny cuz as i understand it, this sub didn't tell people to join with their factions or subs, quite a social experiment they got here. This really is a microsm of humanity!

 Soon enough people will 'figure out' that their number of active users equals space on the board. That means land grabs, alliances, broken alliances... and then global events irl that will unite people for a day or two before the war continues.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Professor X could easily show up in the final episode. The timescale thing is interesting and something that has been talked about. I'm guessing its to fit in with the new x men movies timeframe.

 But i'm not sure you can base any timeframe on what people are wearing etc,most of those things are about personality traits more than anything. Altho my personal theory is because most of the characters are different parts of Davids split personality. 

I agree there are and always will be plot holes, as always with the x-men universe. The alternate reality idea is def possible, as its done alot in the comics, but things would get very messy if they went down that route.  </TEXT>

Loved the line at the end "don't be what they made you to be" line, but is that from a previous film? Reminded me of the "don't let it control "you line from the professor.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all, i have a 'berry section' of sorts, where i grow raspberries, gooseberries and blackcurrants and i'm just looking for advice/opinions on weed control in this area. 


Previously i've just let the weeds grow until you can pull them out by hand, but this isn't very effective and time consuming. Hoeing isn't an option because of the nature of the plants makes it difficult. So basically, is there a weedkiller that can control the weeds but will leave the plants untouched?

<TEXT> So i'm guessing Mitro is on his way considering he's not injured and not on the bench. He's been linked with palace amongst others  but even after a meeting where he supposedly said he wanted to stay, he's not even on the bench? Looks like he'll be leaving then.


So who can we get in to replace him? With xmas n all i'm not up to date on the rumour mill, I've only heard of the Callum Wilson rumour, which imo would be a great signing. 


Also, i know we really could do with a steady centre mid atm, but as today shows (25 shots on goal) we desperatey need someone to take these chances. Too many games we dominate, without scoring. </TEXT>

It *could* have been a host that got shot, it could have been him and he's a made a copy of himself. Or, its his final masterpiece of a host that we've yet to meet. He doesn't mention about wanting to live forever or anything along those lines, so it would be a bit out of the blue.

<TEXT> So, did she make it?


The way i read it was that Ford has sent her on her journey, helping her along the way (which goes some way to explaining the whole felix, sylvester nonsense). She's on her own journey of self discovery, but still one thats entirely orchestrated. Either way, she makes it to the train. Great. But has she actually changed? 


By choosing to go and find her daughter, is she finally accepting what she is, a host that lives in westworld? Or has she failed, and is just unable to shake off her cornerstone? 

Really she's no more sentient than when she first started down the path. Its only more information that shes acquired, shes no more conscious than when she first started 'rebelling'. 

But that choice at the end, was it through self reflection? I'm not so sure.


 Or, maybe thats the point and, just as with humanity, choice is an illusion.

Either that or it is just stock image they used. Either way surely this means the whole thing is someones (hopefully Fords) narrative. Its like some kinda matrix meets the sims meets AI.

<TEXT> I really hope something along these lines is true. 

Take what hes said as true for a minute. After his partner was killed by a host, an 'incident' in the park. Ford builds another host in his exact image, to continue to work alongside him?! Wtf would everyone in the company think about that!? Youd think it would get  a mention here or there. 


The biggest mystery for me is what exactly Ford wants. What is he doing? Why all this effort, why allow 'faulty' robots at all? Everything hes not controlling, he's allowing at least. But to what ends?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> yeah interesting post. I do think there will be a few more reveals when it comes to hosts, the Bernard one was pretty obvious from the get go. Ford being one would actually tie in with a little theory i have with the MiB and delos,  about hosts that can age. 


The main point that you bring up that has hardly been discussed on here since its reveal, is the facts that bernard, or the (AI?) software in him, co-created the other hosts. This is such a huge point. Machines creating machines. It also suggests that Ford isn't the all knowing god that hes demonstrated so far.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Every scene with maeve infuriates me, but her character seems doomed anyway, so i cling on to the hope that it could be at any moment. 

Dolores is interesting, but also, i fear is doomed. She's stuck in a loop like all the others, altho someone is manipulating that loop for some reason still unknown, but i relly don't care at all what happens to her.


Bernard is the only host (i also still think MiB is a host btw) that i care about, but i wouldn't say i'm rooting him on. Well, maybe. It was confirmed last episode that he himself is a co creator of the other hosts. Which is a huge point (that isn't getting much discussion) that will be the key for future westworld funtimes. Machines creating machines, means 'we' don't know how they work. It means Ford hasn't actually got complete control and isn't all knowing. Its the reason why im rooting on bernard, because where his story will take him will reveal everything about westworld. 


But yeah, he's still just a robot ;) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree. Theres no real difference between levels of cosnciousness between humans and hosts. But they are still robots. They intrinsically have less 'worth' than humans, from a human perspective at least. 

I'm not sure where they are going with Ford, but it seems like he knows that the hosts can be 'fully' conscious (incidentally, i'm not sure anyone else does?) but he doesn't care. They are his creations, they are still robots even if they can feel and think the same as a humans. I think he wants them to stay in the park. I think the maze is his test to see if the hosts can 'evolve'. If they do, i think he'll destroy them. Its a way of keeping the system working, matrix style. Any 'neos' will make it to the maze, then wiped.  



But yes, i guess the question shouldn't be whether they are as conscious as humans, but whether it matters.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think there's def something odd about the fact that Ford created everything in westworld, including the hosts, from the bottom up. He can control them at will. And yet, we are seeing some 'rebels' acting out and seemingly realising their consciousness. I don't buy it. I don't buy that hosts can somehow still remember their past lives even after their memories being wiped. Theres nowhere for that information to hide, they made every piece of tech and software in the hosts, they can delete if they need to. 

Ford is old, he's had his time. It sounds like the board have had enough of his shit and are looking to get full control. Whatever is happening with the hosts, Ford is controlling, or at the very least, is fully aware of. I'm not sure what Ford is trying to do but its in defiance of the board, he's not letting anyone take his world away from him.

So yeah, i can see him 'uploading' his consciousness into a host, if it hasn't been done already. But i also think HE will be the one behind the hosts going world war Z on the place. In order to protect it. 

Which, btw, reminds me that (i assume) any one of the hosts personality can be uploaded into any of the other hosts. They must be connected somehow and that information must be stored somewhere in some kind of mainframe. Everyone is connected, which opens up endless possibilities. All you need to do is hack one of them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, i haven't seen this discussed at all yet, but its confused and intrigued the hell out of me. 

Right after having a pretty big argument where Logan comes across as a huge douche, that seems to not care at all about William. Then William abandons Logan as he's taking a beating, and i think he even cries for help. But just as he sees William leave, Logan smiles. Now i know he sees it all as a game, but especially after their argument, i wonder why he seems so genuinely happy that Williams going off on his own?


The last episode showed that theres a lot more going on with Logan, he's not just there to play the game. 


(to add on a  crazy theory, could logan actually be the MiB? Obviously assuming two time frames. Everyones latching on to william, but it makes more sense that its Logan. We now know he's a big dog in the real world, they have very similar temperments and treat westworld like the game that it is. Could it be the reason he wants to find the maze is because thats what William and Dolores were doing first time round?) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I saw that whole scene differently tbh. Wasn't he just attempting to 'hack'  a bird? and in the same episode that we find out there are transmitters being secretly implanted in the hosts by someone or some cause. It could be as simple as that. Felix is working with/for someone and has now finally learned  a part of the code. 


I think they only made it Maeve in the room to throw us, or just add to her story. But i can only assume it was Ford controlling her in order to stop felix. Ford is the only person we've seen who can control hosts and animal hosts alike. Atm theres no reason to think its anyone else, and felix has been found out.  </TEXT>

Its the idea of self reflection that joins everything up, letting the hosts become 'conscious', which we assume was the last update. But it also seems that this function in maeve was voice activated by dolores, whispering her the line about 'violent delights'. 


Maeve is at least as far down the rabbit hole as dolores, even if shes the only focus of bernards attention. (which i suppose just adds to the time frame theories) 

 Which also i don't quite get what the shows saying here, cuz surely  maeve is as 'conscious' as anyone is ever gonna get in the last scenes of ep.4.   </TEXT>

 I think the idea of the self and self reflection is the missing part of the hosts. They won't step out of their loop without it. Those that do, will 'evolve', natural selection, i suppose. 

The show will keep asking the question of consciousness. Does it actually matter who is human? But i also think the show will eventually be cop out. One of the reasons why i think we'll never meet arnold.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> i was going to, and still might, do a post up making similar points. But with a different outcome. 

There does seem to be a real disconnect between how sophisticated the 'hosts' are and how well 'westworld' is run. Simple staffing numbers are worrying enough. How they could possibly lose a host or not notice when theyre tripping out, or going out of the loop. Plus all the points you listed. Its strange that they walked to look for the stray, not even going on horseback.

I think these points are because the park isn't what it once was, and has had budget cuts and reductions, just as a failing amusement park would. We know its at least 30 years old, maybe the novelty has worn off, customers are bored of it. Maybe there are other parks (that we'll see in future series) that have more interest now. 


I agree that this could result in the 'management' that we've been hearing of, selling off 'experiments' to whoever. But more immediately, it leaves Ford the space to experiment himself, before its too late.


I do think there are 2 time frames that we're seeing, one when the parks in full flow when an 'incident' will happen. And one set now, where things are about to majorly wrong/evolutionary leap for the hosts.

<TEXT> i agree with a lot of that, but i'm not sure about anyone = arnold atm. We don't know enough yet, he could have been fords brother or creation or just his partner, but most likely imo, is that arnold was a real person. I think he put his trust in one of the hosts after tryign to give them 'consciousness' and was killed by one of them because of it. By accident or not. 

That one scene where Ford almost angrily reinforced that 'the hosts are not conscious' stood out. Especially when there are other scenes where he almost seems to father them. I wonder if he holds some resentment there.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I thought that too. Maybe he was being so hard on the hosts only infront of the 'outside' hosts, the scientists, which i think includes bernard.

 He needs them to think they are real, to not sympathise with the hosts. Altho obviosuly theres  awhole back story to ford that we don't know yet, but hes very hard to read right now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think its a real possiibility there is no arnold. We are def dealing with different timelines. Whether its just between the dolores interviews or between that and the william story, we don't know yet. But also, we now have seen that a differnt backstory can be uploaded instantly! And considering we don't know for sure whos a host or not (altho i'll be amazed if Bernard isn't) we wil never be able to tell where we are until we see these characters all meeting.

<TEXT> I think the maze is a dead end, or at least, its just a maze. Its meant for guests, not hosts. Which is why its not for him. The only way he found it was scalping someone? I think the maze was a specific game designed for some particular guests in some previous version. HOWEVER, i think there is now something hidden in it and or is being used beyond its original purpose.

 The MiB is absolutely some kind of 'host', but one that is serving an outside player. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm glad i missed this one, it wouldve been my 10th. You might be on to something about spreading themselves too thin thanks to other their festivals, but i think it was down to the lineup. Both poor ticket sales and the poor standard of festival goer can be put down to that. 


You should put those comparison photos in a seperate post. I think everyone was disappointed with the spaceport. And the mainstage has been getting worse year on year imo. They used to put loads of artwork round it, 'increase the peace' signs etc, now its reduced to 2 small screens. 

Calling it 'boutique' after everyone started to complain was a bad move. Altho tbh, i would love it to go back to how it was before it expanded, the vibe was much better back then.  </TEXT>

Anyway for me, its height was in the mid to late 00's when there was loads of new sounds and crazy djs about, that all seemed to play there when in london. It felt new and exciting and edgy, something which its lost over the last few years anyway.

Whats really annoying is that it gets no tv coverage in the uk. The bbc will quite happily show a 3 hour boat race cuz its got a british guy in it, but won't give any attention to the controversial things happening at the same time.

<TEXT> The death of edward 2nd and all that followed until edward 3rd took the throne.  Real game of thrones stuff. 


To try and give a brief description, Ed was a a bit of a playboy, openly bi-sexual whos 'close friends' caused many revolts and was a pretty terrible king. A lot of people didn't like his boyfriend, so hunted down and killed him. Ed fought back. He also got a new 'close friend', Hugh Despenser. Between them, they executed and exiled his enemies.

 Isabella, his (french) queen had enough of his shit and on a short visit home, refused to return back to england with their child, Ed 3rd. Instead, she met up with a guy called Mortimer, (someone who was due to be executed during Eds retalitaion, but whilst in prison, managed to drug the guards and climb the walls, before escaping to france) rallied some norman barons and returned to england to claim the throne, in the name of her son. Shit went down and Ed was forced to surrender. Mortimer and isabella then went to rule as her son was too young. Obvs.

 Whilst locked up, Ed was supposedly murdered, but in fact escaped to italy to live out his days as a monk, most likely with the aid of  his son and supporters. Young Ed 3rd had enough of mortimer, executed him and took the crown back for himself.



Actually just reading that back, it mght be better as a tv series.

<TEXT> ah yeah, good shout. I've seen both versions (and read the book), i prefer the original black n white. Something about the sounds and visuals of the original that is so unsettling.

<TEXT> Saw it last night, really really don't understand why the critics are going in on it. I'm not really a 'fan' of comic book films, altho there are exceptions. The whole marvel universe is way too happy happy flag waving for me. Same could be said of the superman films. 


The film was pretty close to what i expected tho. Popcorn. An enteraining action movie, simple. I thought jared leto was fine as the joker, considering its an impossible job following heath ledgers version. Plenty of cheesy jokes and action scenes, but again, as expected of this genre. 

The only problem i had with it was how dark everything was. Every scene looked like it was put through some filter to make it darker. 


Not sure what movie critics expect from this genre? Its equally as good and as terrible as 90% of all the other comic book adaptions.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-07-15 20:55:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, i'm not sure if this is a thing or there maybe a seperate sub for it, but i think it deserves its place here.


Basically the new stuff from mstrkrft reminded me of an old mstrkrft song, which in turn reminded me of another two aswesome tracks with the same title. 

So there it is, songs with the same title. (that are great)


First up **MSTRKRFT**, who if you dont know about, make pretty heavy electro-house music. This track is kind of a change from that with soulful vocals from the master that is John Legend.

[MSTRKRFT - Heartbreaker] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6gHLHbYVeA)


Completely different vibes altogether from **Metronomy**, alternative indie from the 'nu rave' era. First album is still the best imo, before the line up change. Later stuff is still mazing tho. So so many feelings for me wrapped up in this track. Damn, time flies. 


[Metronomy - Heartbreaker] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsduHmjQlgI) 


Again, completely different vibes, into more commercial dance pop song terrority from **Steve Aoki** and Lovefoxx. For me, this is when Aoki and the dimmak label peaked. Before he (and the rest of america) got obessed with the whole idea of EDM. Great pop song, nothing much more.


[Steve Aoki Ft. Lovefoxx - Heartbreaker] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViB4IR-7mtk)


.


So yeah, any other (good) tracks with the same title 'Heartbreaker' ?

<TEXT> So, i'm a little confused at how i should feel with the king in da norf speech. Sure it was rousing, but we know Jons not neds son. We know hes a targ. Maybe, littlefinger knows too. But it felt like the people in the room were accepting him mainly because he was neds son. Do you think it would it matter to any of them when its revealed that hes not? 

They didn't seem to care he was a bastard, but would they care that hes a targaryen? If littlefinger knows, then maybe thats his way in.

<TEXT> I don't read any book series really, so i can't say. Sharpe, from way back in the day, was great. I love Gomorrah, but haven't read the book to base it off. I think the walking dead is terrible, but very enjoyable to casually watch at the same time. 

Just to be clear, i love watching game of thrones (most of the time). The first few seasons, maybe up to 4, were great. I wasn't bothered about the changes so much, because the in show logic stayed pretty true. But the last couple of seasons they have very clearly shifted direction, and target audience. They are much happier to produce 1 or 2 visually impressive episodes, than to spends time with characters. Its been dumbed down basically. 
They're quick to respond to any criticism with budget, or time or whatever, but i think its just cuz theyve changed from making a great show, to making the biggest show they possibly can. They go searching for the hashtags and the memes now. They use shock value to entertain the audience, rather than the audience being entertained by a 'shock'. It just seems like they don't care about it anymore. Certain directors bring episodes to life, but they can't undo the mad plot points and inconsistant logic. 

I try and enjoy it as popcorn now, but certain things still rattle me! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah some people get personally offended when people criticise the show, when clearly, theres plenty wrong with it. I can like the show and praise parts of it, aswell as shame it for all of its mistakes. You're allowed to do that!

Yes the citadel looked great. To be fair i think Danys scenes have been pretty strong. She gets a lot of abuse, but i think her actings fine. The sheer power of Drogon has been made very clear this season. And the score has been awesome, minus that strange piano thing. Thats my real problem with it tbh, they seem to be happy with just get the cinematics looking great for the 'big scenes' and forget all the important joining up bits. Where its the 'joining up' parts that makes me love the books so much.

I often wonder how show only viewers handle these things, but obviously you don't get many on these boards. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ok, so plot 'holes' is probs a stretch tbh. The majority are the long standing plot 'points'. The absence of Ghost. Davos only now finding out what happen to Shireen. Sansa basically fucking over jon by not telling him about the vale army and then Jon not ripping into her about it in this episode. Tommen throwing himself out the window after little or no character build up that would suggest this. The sandsnakes killing the martells off becuase they wouldnt avenge the death of other martells, and then in this episode it turns out theyve just been sitting around in dorne not avenging the death of the martells anyway. The timeline was insane, who knows what happened when and how long inbetween scenes from arya, jaime and varys in particular. After going so slowly all season, this was crazytown. Aryas pies were thrown in like a last minute thought, it had no impact, never mind being implausible.


It had all the pieces here, it just all fell flat for me. I've kinda had enough of it by now, so i find myself becoming super critical of everything. </TEXT>

I thought there was something missing, and it just dawned on me! I know its such a huge show and they are so busy and there was so much going on in this episode with dragons and what not, so i do feel a litle bad for them as its an easy mistake to make. Really someone shoulve pointed it out to them BEFORE it aired, so i think theyll be a little annoyed at the director and the writers for not noticing earlier. But wow what a big mistake by them to forget him.  </TEXT>

I really want Jon to be pissed at Sansa, cuz he fucking well should be. 

End shot has to be something that links to the fact that the whites are a coming, so i'm going for tiny little scene from the wall reminding us how loveable ed is, then a 3 blast of the horn. END SCENE. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, Jon is to assume that Ramsay has no interest in saving the north from WW, instead of speaking to him to know for sure? He assumes the same from the Karstarks and the Umbers aswell? Despite them possibly not even knowing there is a threat? 

He hasn't made enough effort to avoid this. He knows full well that he needs as many men as possible, yet is willing to risk all of his men and his own life on an assumption or speculation.

Why shouldn't he talk to him, by raven or messenger or in person? And the same for the Karstarks and Umbers. He knows how important these fighting men on both sides are, he hasn't done enough imo. 

Although i do completely agree that when he meets him on the field Jon will try and address some of this. I'm sure there will some attempt at negotation. But as he should know, the battle field is not the place to do it and it won't change the enivitable. If his plan was to assemble an army big enough to 'scare' Ramsay off in some way, the audience hasn't been made aware of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I couldn't remember exactly what happened with bran, just that he knew he went north. 

Might point still being tho, that he knows the long night is coming. After all the effort into getting the wildings beyond the wall, because they are needed, his plan is to march them against a much larger army? He is against impossible odds against the boltons, he said himself he hasn't got enough men. Why, when you haven't got enough to fight Ramsay, nevermind the bigger more important fight against the WW, would you even consider engaging them?  He is killing hundreds if not thousands of fighting men on both sides. 


Why not meet him? He went on his own to mance. Why not attack by skirmish or try to assassinate him? Why not even consider meeting with the bolton allies?


For me, its not made clear what Jons motivations are. I think they expect the audience to just go along with it because its jon snow and team stark, ignoring most of what has led Jon to this point and his own logic thus far. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The lannisters and especially the freys killed half his family, yet he did nothing. Not only that, he went against the traditions, long held beliefs, duty of the starks and let the wildlings through the wall. He let his half brother (known heir to winterfell?) go off north of the wall. So only now family is important?  (And also sansa is safe there with him atm anyway.)


But mainly, there are other ways than marching the army, that Jon betrayed his family name/the north/the nightswatch for (the army that Jon is so certain is needed to fight the WW) against yet more northern men that jon needs in the battles to come.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sticking with the show.


 Jon was so certain that he needs men to fight the white walkers, he did something unthinkable for a northerner. Making peace with the wildings, letting them through the wall was such a huge deal for a Stark and the north, never mind the nightswatch. He did it because he needed the men yes? So why is he even fighting Ramsay? A battle that will massively dwindle 'his own' forces and the Bolton alliance. Its not just Boltons hes fighting remember. 



Really his beef is with Ramsay and him alone. I imagine he will call him out on the battlefield for a 1v1, but obviously, that will not work. Basically what i'm wondering is if the show has addressed this. Did i miss something? I know he was glum for a few episodes but i can't remembering him protesting massively at sansas revenge mode. 

**Everything he's done so far, all the sacrifices he's made, by his own logic, he should not be fighting this battle.** In fact he should be doing everything he possibly can to stop it. He doesn't need to make peace with Ramsay, he just need to speak with him. He needs his men. The boltons are wardens of the north now, Jon doesn't really know enough about Ramsay to think he will completely abandon his duty to that title. But more importantly, he's done nothing to try and convince the karstarks and the umbers to stand down, join him, send men north. Anything to stop more northerners dying. 



Its not that i don't want him to fight for winterfell, for the starks. Its just he's had so many chances to do that before. He hasn't because he knows there's bigger fish to fry. Why he's decided to go along with this hasn't been made clear enough imo. In the grand scheme of things, he absolutely should be against this battle. It doesn't need to happen, and will leave the north a whole lot weaker.

I've had it in mind that she MUST be plotting something, because shes basically done fuck all about anything so far. But still, nothing. The HS is owning the show. She doesn't even see Tommen anymore. She gets wrecked by Olenna. Is fine with sending Jaime away. Just whats going on?

<TEXT> I was going to write a post on this very subject as no ome else seems to have mentioned it? I thought about Kevan too, as in the show its easy to see the HS going for hand of the king. However, i'm not sure what 'sins 'he's carried out, that the audience know of anyway. Also, i think he's somehow aligned himself witht he faith too, or at least is putting up no fight. In the last episode, he did and said nothing at all, despite the big reveal. 


However, i'm going for Qyburn. He's done a hell of a lot that the faith would not like. And i'm sure Pycelle, who seems to be in favour of the faith, would have told them enough. This would also be the catalyst for cersei, via Robert Strong, to go and crack some skulls.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Really great song from a talent i'm sure we'll see more of. However, i can't agree with pharrell about not sounding like anything hes heard before? This song fits into 'HypeM 2014-2016'. Sound slike so many other female singers right now. Halsey, Banks, Sara Hartman, Kyla, Emma Louise, Oh wonder, Shura, Isabel, Mura Masa, Sunday, Chelsea Lankes, even acts like Mo or Alessia Cara or Vaults. Theres so many i forget most of them, a few big ones i can't think of right now. 


I like this song, she looks ridiculously talented and is def cute enough to be star. I'm just saying that the land of new music is flooded with this kinda sound atm.  </TEXT>

And more so Sam is a dick if he expects anything less. He himself hated wildings. He himself would have never believed in whites or giants or anything like that, so why would he? It annoyed me he didn't explain himself. All he needed to do was to tell them everything that happened to him, from craster to stannis to hardhome. (i know its done like that in the show for that very effect on the audience, but still) He should be convincing his dad in order to have more support for Jon.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Margaery's plan (Spoilers Everything) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-30 17:55:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Straight to it. **Queen marg has not converted. She is fully aware of what she doing and is playing a long game to ensure she stays queen, by eventually killing Tommen.**


She's wasn't in a good position. Her king is easily manipulated, hasn't the will or the balls to stand up to anyone. Along with her brother she was locked away in her own city by a bunch of fanatics. Led by a very cunning man, that to a certain extent has sweet talked the king for his own ends. Not much to work with.. However, what she has got is influence over the king, and the affection of the smallfolk.. 


 The scene with Tommen is everything we need to know. Marg wasn't exactly convincing in showing Tommen any affection after not seeing him for so long, but it was enough to show him he's missed.  The line **"He's not quite what we thought he was, is he?"** in reference to the HS is such a loaded statement. Theres a huge amount of malice coming from her, almost saying it through gritted teeth. But also i think she was testing the waters, to see how she needs to continue on the conversation.  Convincing Tommen to align with the faith was really her only option left. By doing that, in theory, she is safe from anymore ill treatment from the HS. Her family are safe from damaging their position. The Lannisters are all but spent. And, she still has the love and support of the masses. With this, she has everything she needs to rule.



**But she still can't trust Tommen.** He is too young, vulnerable, prone to manipulation. He did nothing to stop her imprisonment, to protect her, even tho he had the power to do so. 


She is fully aware the HS is in this for his own ends. I'm not sure exactly how this coming together will change things, but i imagine he will sit on the council and possibly come to replace the hand? Either way he's trouble, considering how easily influenced Tommen is and with his hold over the smallfolk. 

However, even with the situation as it stands, she could potentially rule all on her own. Two things remain. Get pregnant, if not already done. And then get rid of Tommen. I think she'll be the one that kills Tommen. She is that ruthless.  And with that, she is queen with a baby on the way. The Lannisters are all but gone and she has devoted followers all around her. She has shown time and again how she only cares about being queen. Her scenes with cersei shows how nasty she can be. Olenna plotted to kill Joff, so why not kill Tommen too?



*My only niggles. I don't think for a minute the HS believes marg has turned. He could potentially reveal to Tommen that the tyrells killed Joff if needs be. But for now she is too powerful via the tyrell army and support of the smallfolk to mess too much with. Kevan didn't seem to have a word to say about this move. Whether he's in on it or just has the bigger picture in mind, i don't know.  
Also cersei. She must be planning something, i just don't know what.

<TEXT> Yes absolutely. I think on the show they have stayed away from her mad side until shes finally on her way to westeros, and then the confliction will begin. 

I know its an obvious thing to say, but without her dragons i think the audience would be completely against her. The empathy the audience has with the dragons, esp drogon, automatically puts us with her. But shes a very confused character. Shes been manipulated throughout her whole life. The only 'truth' about her is her targ routes and her dragons. But that enevitably means death and destruction, and this time as a conquerer. 


I think the show will begin to explore that more and more. Particularly when her dragons incinerate hundreds of people in one sitting.

<DATE> 2016-05-24 18:53:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'll keep it simple. Bran is important not because of his 'time travel' abilities, or the fact he is a stark, but because of his warging abilities in general. 

Personally, i don't think he has the ability to jump back through time at will, he only went where bloodraven showed him to go (and i think that was only where Bloodraven had been or seen himself?). And he only did that to get bran to where he needed to be. I think (and hope in the show) that it will be revealed why and how bloodraven came to be. But his purpose, whether originally so or by discovery, was to find the most powerful greenseer and 'teach' him. 

The CtoF need Bran because they think he can become, or already is, powerful enough to go against the night king and stop the whites. 


At this point i think its important to say that i think  **the night king doesn't 'raise the dead'. He wargs the dead.** 

This probs isn't a massive shock to lots of people, but i think its a key difference. They are not zombies, they are being controlled. And Bran can control them in the same way. 


Bran has been told he can be the most powerful greenseer ever. But no one has told him yet what he actually has to do with these powers.  I believe (or at least i think the CotF believe) he can stop the night king, by himself warging the dead. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Choice is not an illusion, it is very real. Its when you combine choice with the idea of free will that you get a contradiction. 


How do you come to the conclusion that the actions of the characters are meaningless? I would say exactly the opposite. The entirety of actions by individual characters is meaningful, and only that. What i mean by that is they themselves are the sum of their actions, its not meaningless causality. Its beautiful causality. Look at the world that causality has created. 


You can simplify it throughout the world of asoiaf, through lineage, through catastrophe, through revenge or redemption. **Its casual determinism that drives the world forwards.**


 HOWEVER. GRRM has introduced  a 'true act of god'. Of which i mean, a complete unkown, unknowable event. That red comet. And subsequently **daenerys**. She is the the idea of free will in this world grrm has created. She is the unknown. Beyond the reaches of the weirwoods. I think she will become more and more important for what she is as the story progresses.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Determinism or causal determinism is the way any world works tho. (Except, in GRRMS world at least, for one particular thing.) Those characters 'failed' because of the choices they made, even if their choices were always going to go a certain way. Its 'always going to happen' becuase of their choices, not the other round, if thats makes sense...

It only cheapens the story if we have a gods eye view of things, which so far we've had only because of bloodraven. Now he's gone, in theory, everything is new. We are at the forefront of causality with bran. Everything is predetermined, yes, but everything for us is still unknown. As far as we and bran are concerned he can still change anything and everything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm seeing bran more of a Dr manhattan tbh. If the past is written then so is the future. Its unavoidably preordained. However, as we're seeing things through bran, we don't know the future. But he can change anything in the past or the future. 

I agree, that in the eyes of the universe nothign is actaully being re-written, but thats not how we are seeing things. Especially now that bloodraven is 'gone'. Everything now is new. Past, present or future.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> First off, i think bran will see more of them and bloodraven, when he gets the chance to plug into another weirwood. Because, damn, i will be so disappointed if thats all we get to know about them and the whites. Surely theres more to come from them. 


So anyway, from what we know so far, the CotF are getting everything they deserve. Their plan to fight off the the andals(or the first men?) is to somehow create a monster to unleash onto the world? Sounds dodgy and obvsly something went badly wrong. Whatever happened in the mean time with bloodraven has led them to here, all hopes resting on Bran, who obviously has to do something important. Although for some reason they haven't told him what that is yet. Then before you know it, its too late. They didn't tell bran that he could accidentally give away his position that would allow the whites to instantly be upon them. And now they're all dead? This doesn't seem very well thought out. 


I'm really hoping there are more of them somewhere. Maybe on the isle of faces, maybe elsewhere in the north. I just can't believe they are that useless when it seems they've been planning things for a long time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its a solid theory, but you did leave out the sandsnakes, who are currently on the loose in KL and will surely have some impact. Whether through assassination or through a dornish army rocking up at some point. 


My main problem with this is the HS knows that Tommen would tell cersei everything. He also knows that the Tyrells have the biggest army by far in town and could easily wipe out his thugs, however many there are.


 All his talk from the HS about not caring about his own life etc is obviously bullshit, he wants to be the kings number 1. He needs cersei gone, so i think a double/triple cross is on the cards. Although all that will entail is a trial by combact. Throwing  a theory out there. Possibly a trial between of the lannisters vs the tyrells. Did they kill joffrey or not. </TEXT>

Not many good points on this episode imo. Very dull, yet more scene setting for the end of season episodes with frustrating things left out or unsaid.


Meereen was great, it created an odd but interesting dynamic between those characters. Kind of made last episodes little scene even more pointless tho. Ramsay is now a full on pantomime villain. 

Everyone saying that stuff has happened off screen can eat shit, cuz Davos still didn't (still doesnt really) know what happened to stannis and shireen etc. Unashamedly terrible writing. 

The letter scene. The less said the better. Jesus christ, compare that to the book! Its like they gave up trying to match it, so just sat them round a table. 


Dany is now a full on pyschopath. This may well be the start of show dany finding her targ routes, by becoming a ruthless, genoicide loving pyromaniac.  </TEXT>

IMO there is a mass of evidence for the umbers using Rickon to trick Ramsay. It makes sense of their otherwise inexplicable actions. HOWEVER, the show has time and time again has shown us that logic and reason and things making sense, mean absolutely fuck all.

 Ramsay has been 'gifted' with absurd plot devices throughout the show, so i have very low hopes for this conspiracy.  </TEXT>

Ahem.



Reluctantly keeping this show based. And maybe the answer to this is (frustratingly a more common occurence in GoT) we will have to guess the rest of the story so it makes sense, and never see what he's actually done as hand. However, so far, he doesn't seem to be that great at it? I mean, the queen is forcibly locked away at the hands of religious militants in the kings own city. Along with the queens brother. A Tyrell family, who not only seems to feed the capital if not a large part of westeros(?), but also has the largest army sat around doing bugger all. Kevans own blood, as cersei rightly put it, was murdered how long ago now? With the distinct possibility of an instant war with Dorne and a direct threat to tommens life. Still no action.
 As far as they are aware the Boltons have done the dirty marrying sansa, uniting the north. What news from the wall is reaching them? as they don't seem concerned at all about either the wildlings or the whites. 


How long before he takes action?

I think she will somehow put Tommens life in serious danger, and not try to help him as she thinks his death is enevitable anyway. Jaime to the rescue, probs killing her in the process.


Although i think cersei will have turned on Jaime by then anyway, as she is starting to in the books. In the show its not happened yet but with the riverlands story coming up, its probs set to. In the show Jaime is indirectly responsible for the deaths of how many lannisters? He killed his cousin, was kingsguard when joff died, let Tyrion out who killed Tywin and did (could do) nothing to save Myrcella. In show Cersei should already hate him, and i don't think it will be long before she cracks.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is why the writing is so bad in the last few seasons. Ramsay is the personification of all the terrible plot holes in their story telling. Its infuriating how they build up characters, plots, in order for you to give a crap about them, but then instantly drop every ounce of logic surrounding that, in order to push their nonsensical story forward. Or more likely, for shock value.  </TEXT>

Haralds reaction was ridiculous unless he was in on it somehow and for some reason. It still doesn't explain why Roose would taunt him, but hey, its the show.

<TEXT> So Ramsay bastard snow just stabbed his daddy to death infront of Rooses long serving maester and the head of the Karstarks, their biggest ally (in terms of numbers), to become Lord Ramsay Bolton. Shit move son. To celebrate this, he then feeds walda, walders niece(?) and son to the dogs. Seriously Ramsay, you're not one for politics are you. 



Now i have many problems with this. One, is that i really like Roose Bolton, in the show and moreso in the book he is absolutely ruthless. I'm sure many book enthusiasts will have a problem with how ridiculous this scene is too, but this is the show, so i'm going to try and take this on show terms only. 




Ramsay is a maniac. Roose is fully aware of the shit he gets up to and even specifically cites the 'games' he's played during this scene. So why constantly taunt him? Other than to shove the obvious foreshadowing down the viewers throats, this makes no sense. Roose is a smart man, he knows how crazy Ramsay is and what he could gain from killing his newborn or himself. This is an unnecessary plothole in my eyes. 

.

However, continuing on imagining that this move makes writing sense, Ramsay should now have put himself in a really really shit position. Roose Bolton, who united northern and allied with the Freys, to take the north from the Starks is now dead. Ramsay, the well known nutcase, is now running things. Walda Frey is dead, Walder Frey is not an idiot. Ok, lets say no one knows how she died, somehow no one saw them or heard the screams or had to clear up the body. Or lets say that Walder simply doesn't care, which is passable. But he certainly won't do any favours for Ramsay, anyone riding north (say an army pissed at the boltons) will have free reign. 

The now head of house Karstark just witnessed the death of the warden of the north at the hands of his son and apparently couldn't care less. Either this makes no sense, or Harald is way smarter than his dad. Going against Ramsay in this situation would certainly end him, so best to keep quiet, but damn, he was cool about it. But really, what reason has he to continue to work with Ramsay now, a known lunatic? Someone who, even knowing that the Lannisters are likely coming for them, just decided it would be a good idea to attack castle black? If i were a Harald i would be planning a return home with all my troops as quick as i could. The same could be said of the Whitehalls, who we don't know much about, except they are long allies with the Boltons.  The main point here being that Ramsay is a known by all, now beyond doubt, to be an irrational pyschopath. Even if they didn't suspect Ramsay of killing Roose, which would unavoidably come out, they all have reason to mistrust Ramsay and doubt his ability to rule. Remembering, they are now supposed to be in Ramsays service. 



Maester Wolkan the Bolton Maester, would know all about Ramsay. Its safe to say that he would be slightly unerved if not a little agrieved at Rooses death by his bastard son. Another bad move by Ramsay is not to kill him immediately. I'll be amazed, even for the show, if he doesn't send some ravens informing other maesters of what has happened. 


.


What comes of all this i guess we'll wait and see. Even if the trailer for ep3 gives us a clue, i cannot see how any of the other houses or Rooses men would stay loyal to him. Whether they ignore this and just run with it, or he loses troops making winterfell vulnerable, theres a few plot points here that don't add up.

<TEXT> Ramsay killing roose has been in your face foreshadowed for ages now, and although annoying, is in keeping with show ramsay. Not really that in keeping with show roose, but hey, it so seperate from the book that i don't care anymore.

 However, even in show, how does Ramsay expect to lead the boltons and its 'coalition'? The men are loyal to roose, they know how mad ramsay is. For reasons unknown the young karstark didn't care that roose just got stabbed by his notoriously insane bastard son, unless he's smart and is playing a longer game. Which is what im interested to see how it plays out. I would be very surprised if that maester, whicj i assume has served roose for god knows how long, keeps what he saw to himself. As things continue to unravel for Ramsay, i wonder if he the men around him will stay loyal as they have no reason to do so. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah i mostly agree, generally speaking any voice against the show is immediately shouted down by its defenders, who seem unable to take any criticism against the show.

 But there are still plenty of book readers (or show watchers) who will offer an opinion against the show, it just takes longer for that argument to pick up steam. Altho yes, often this leads to it never being seen, because its downvoted into oblivion before it gets a chance. 


The real difference for me, very generally speaking, is that there are a lot of people that simply won't take any critique about the show unless its a positive one. Whereas book readers are fully prepared to find fault whilst critiquing the books and its author.

 Imo, its very rare that i see an unjust criticism of the show. It annoys me when a well thought out argument is downvoted simply because they don't like a negative opinion on the show.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are big problems with some stuff at the wall, but as said already, they're not really protecting the corpse, they are just staying loyal to jon and protecting themselves in the process. I guess they left the body in the open as its a message, he was a traitor in their eyes. Why he stabbed him now is questionable tho. 

Its not explained why mel can come n go, but thorne shouldn't have  a problem with it. What is baffling tho, is why Davos isn't pinning her down to gett he details of whats happened to stannis and shireen. Stannis, the person he's devoted his life to for how many years? and yet is happy for mel just to walk off?  </TEXT>

She's so desperate to be a 'proper' knight. But ends up breaking oathes and changing shields. I wonder if she will have an enlightened moment or carry on the journey becoming the exact opposite of what she wants to be.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> techincally no, but that doesn't matter anymore anyway. Throughout the series (esp this season i think) and books, people change, especially after 'dramatic' turns in their lives. I don't think it will be the same Jon after resurrection. Its not as clear in the show, but he's very uncertain and ponderous, constantly questioning himself whether hes doing the right thing etc. After rebirth i think he'll be far more ruthless and straight to the point. For better or worse. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 8.5 out of 10?!?! you are madder than king Aerys on his stag night.


Some people jump so quickly to defend the show and refuse to accept any criticism towards it. And no, its not just book readers upset that its 'off book'. Its the piss poor writing and direction. Last series the show gave up trying to make any sense, to run logically, its almost a lack of respect to its viewers. More and more they seem happy with sweeping ideas and shock value, rather than joining the dots in a coherent narrative. It stinks of a  'don't worry, we're making millions' attitude 'it doesn't matter, this matters' etc. The same path as shows like the walking dead and back in the day, lost went down. They could so easily have a tiny bit of dialogue here, a little scene there, to join it up, but no. It doesn't matter.  That trend seems to have continued this season.



Having said that, yes, there was good things about this episode. Ramsay and Roose and most of castle black was great. But, no negatives? Really? Where to begin. Hide there, oh, found you. Disappearing dogs. Wheres Tommen? How long was that boat trip and why didn't they turn around? Why is trystane on a different boat, then shit at fighting. Areo hotah?! Jorah still in his blood soaked clothes? jorah and daario 'heading north' managed to find exactly where they landed? No one recognising khaleesi? Personally i think this will be on of the lowest ranking episodes, the only thing it does is what they wanted it to do, and thats look forward to the next episode. 4/10

<TEXT> I'm really hyped for the show, yes, but last season kinda changed my stance on everything GoT. Only today i finished the rewatch in preparation and it struck me that season 5 is absolutely dire. Even the bits i thought were good at the time look dodgy rewatching. Some of of the dialogue is laughable, never mind the inexcusable 'shock factor' scenes.


I really hope this season nails it (and of course i will continue watching) but for me, GoT has become a fan fiction to fill the time between books.  </TEXT>

 Personally, i can't see how anyone can say for certainty either way (and get upset with the otherside of the argument) Clearly there's enough evidence that GRRM intentionally wrote it to spark the readers curiosity. The possibility that he's still alive is undeniably there, however unlikely.  </TEXT>

 I can see an alternative where Roose, who has already essentially seen his plan to secure the north fall through, figure that he's in an unwinable situation and withdraws from winterfell. Leaving Ramsay to sort the mess out, which means in reality means sacrificing his son as a punishment, if not to help him escape. Ramsay, keen to prove he's actually useful, jumps straight in, but enevetibly loses.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> well, i don't think Dany is going back via braavos, although that doesn't rule out Arya being sent near Dany. Not sure why she would want her in her company anyway? I guess Tyrion must have met her at some point. Unless as you say, she takes  a new face. Who and why i don't think we have any clues on. </TEXT>

<TITLE> What's the point of Arya? (Spoilers Everything) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-13 17:13:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> To start let me say that in no way is this meant to be against the chracter of arya in the book or show. Both i think are brilliant. 

However, for such a 'main' character, what is the point of her? Where is she going to end up? What impact will she have on things, if any? 

For me, for nothing to come from her journey would be more of a let down than Dany dying in the desert. I've put forward a few theories of how she will eventually get back to westeros but the way the show is going has me leaning toward a different idea involving mr onions and sansa. Previously i thought that Arya would be 'contracted' to kill littlefinger, for all his dodgy dealings, that would eventually piss off someone enough to put a price on his head. Subsequently some kind of drama happens involving LF, Sansa and Arya, equalling a death. But now, looking at the show, i think that the same thing will happen, only with Davos as the one with a price on his head. 

The iron bank are surely pissed at the apparent waste of money backing stannis was, with no chance of getting paid back. Scores need to be settled. Davos was the man behind the deal, so i think he will be the one who Arya is sent to kill. Resulting in any number of outcomes, although the accidental death of Sansa at Aryas hands wouldn't be out of place. 


I can't see how Arya can get drawn back into the story if not to assassinate someone.

<TEXT> Not just him. And its only speculation. But because you don't see him die and the dialogue beforehand. (and the huge plot points,  but they are circumstantial) Brienne, whos whole story is about how desperate she is to become a proper knight, is reminded to "do her duty" by stannis. 

So yeah, if he is alive, it would be no surprise at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ok, i found at least a part of it, hopefully someoe will jump in with any more. its in ASOS, chapter 53, tyrion talking to tywin.

Prince Oberyn's presence here is unfortunate. His brother is a cautious man, a reasoned man, subtle, deliberate, even indolent to a degree. He is a man who weighs the consequences of every word and every action. But Oberyn has always been half-mad."
"Is it true he tried to raise Dorne for Viserys?"
"No one speaks of it, but yes. Ravens flew and riders rode, with what secret messages I never knew. Jon Arryn sailed to Sunspear to return Prince Lewyn's bones, sat down with Prince Doran, and ended all the talk of war. But Robert never went to Dorne thereafter, and Prince Oberyn seldom left it. </TEXT>

Doran himself says he's been planning revenge since elia was murdered, can't quote exact paragraphs off the top of my head. Which i suppose doesn't mean he's actually smart, but if youve been planning that long, even an idiot (that has lived dorans life) would have something better in the works than the mess he seems to have atm. 


He has a lot of players across the board, even tho on the face of it, they essentially aren't (weren't in the case of oberyn) having much impact on things.  </TEXT>

For such a smart man, he's made some (apparently) terrible decisions. Maybe theres more to his plans or maybe thats just his character, and dorne will have no real impact in westeros. I'm not sure we as readers have enough info to know right now, unless preston has managed to join the dots that lead to something. 


 Either way, i'm looking forward to the rest of these. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great post! Love reading more about Roose. One of my fav characters in the books, for simply how prudently abominable a person he is. I've always insisted he is so much worse than Ramsay, 'the mad dog', compared to a calculating pyschopath. Something which i think is overlooked because of how strong 'show ramsay' is. Show Ramsay makes a great villain which will (hopefully) mean a huge twist for show watchers, when Roose royally fucks him over. 


I say hopefully, because that will be the test for Ramsay. Will he see it coming and be prepared? I'm really not sure who will survive in the end, but the way its set up, i'm pretty sure one will die at the hands of the other.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> First off, this is an awesome line to end what is, i think, the best trailer for a season yet. A great line because it could mean so many things in the context of that scene, and also because clearly the people who made the trailer are either trolling us, or genuinely are sorry for how off-book this season will go. But yeah, perfect hype makers.


As for that scene tho. So many questions. I'm not entirely sure the "i've never been much of a fighter" comes directly before that line. It sounds like its been cut in, but also Davos isn't exactly the sort to wise crack just before a fight in pretty dire circumstances. Is he?


So what/to whom is he apologising for? To me it looks like they are defending Jon. Ghost is laying guard (and not attacking the people in the room) So i don't think anyone is trying to immediately sacrifice anyone here or slice up jon to prevent re-animation. It seems like they are stopping the men in the previous shots from getting in. Which we can guess is for Mel to do her work? Which hopefully doesn't mean, seven fucking save me, the sacrifice of Ghost. Altho its worryingly plausible. As shown previously on screen (for no apparent reason) mel has a way with ghost and gets very friendly with him. I would much prefer a self scarifice on mels part or better yet for her to simply to shag Jon back to life, i mean necrophilia is one of the few faux pas left for GoT to explore. 



So Davos is apologising to the men? For being shit at swordplay? Maybe there's soemone else in that room, someone less familiar with bloodshed? It doesn't sound right that Davos would give a shit what those nightswatch think and wouldn't it be more likely him making the orders? 
Maybe i'm reading way too much into it, as i will with every other scene in that trailer until the season starts! Got me thinking tho, thoughts? </TEXT>

<TEXT> well they are competitive, but there are other countries that french supermarkets can trade with can massively undercut them. The underlying issue here is france, and in this case, bretagne losing its cultural identity. The knock on effect is huge. More and more, local shops are closing because of big supermarkets opening in rural areas. Its something that happened in the uk 20 or so years ago, without much struggle i might add. But its soemthing that a large number of people in these rural villages don't want. 

Its easy to say 'become competitive', but thats not what its about. Getting rich is not what these people aspire to. Food already is comparatively expensive in france, but people (or at least the ones i have spoken with or heard from) don't mind paying because the food is their land, its their culture. Food is important. The bigger issue is them trying to protect their country from being overhauled by 'western' ideas and philosophy. Probably a losing battle, especially as they're in the eu. Like you said, they already do get huge subsidies from the eu, so they are caught in a catch 22.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This post comes out of a fiery/friendly discussion about diplo, mainly, that 'theres no one makes music anything like him'...yu huh.

and so


Diplo wasn't always major lazer, and he didn't always have that style of music. In fact, i'm pretty sure i can trace the time he changed his style to when he joined Dimmaks european tour, i think late 00's. The tour was all about Crookers, who really broke out at that time. (I can testify, the shows were intense, electro was huge at the time and crookers were at the extreme/noisy end of that spectrum) After that, he worked seperately with phra and bot (crookers), released some remixes and at the same time, started the whole major lazer thing with Switch. 


But anyway. Details aren't whats on my mind. Its insane tracks like this that are. Stuff like this simply wouldn't get played out nowdays. (unless it had a diplo co-prod on it....)

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've seen a few threads saying how its good that the show hasn't really spoiled any of the future books, because the stories are so different. But, WHAT?! I would say its the worst possible situation. We are left in a position where we don't know if what's happened in the show is a spoiler or not.



From the Shireen burning, to the battle, to Stannis, to Myrcella even to whats happening at the wall and in Meereen. Basically, its worse because i don't know how pissed i should be. At the show and the books.  There's already enough implied spoilers this series merely by the absence of certain characters. I just really hope TWOW is out before the next series. For the love of Rhllor George, save us from the show, please. </TEXT>

Book and show wise i was convinced, and yes maybe there is a chance that he still is in with them, but surely its less likely. So its not Daario and not Hizdhar, who the hell is it?!



That scene also may have introduced the pale mare. I was wondering if and when the flux/pale mare would get into meereen but now its inside the walls in the form of Jorah. So bookwise, i suppose with all the build up and paragraphs about the disease a pay off is expected, so with a casualty in her inner circle? I know its dangerous to apply show logic to the books, but if they are heading in the same direction? .....

[the pit] (http://share.gifyoutube.com/y0zRjz.gif)


Seriously tho, the impact that it had in the book will be lost on screen. I imagine it will be far more concerned with how the fight scenes play out, which is ok i suppose, as its a visual medium after all. However, show watchers will miss out on what a release Drogon was. 



After the long slog of Meereen, Dany being manipulated more and more, losing power, losing herself. She was lost in Meereen, was basically forced into marriage, had to re-open the pits. She was almost powerless in her own city. 
The tension was so high reading that chapter, we all knew something was going to happen. Tyrion possibly meeting her, Strong Belwas dinner problems, will Daario show, Yunkai ready for war. And then boom, Drogon is back. And as everyone runs or trys to kill him, Danys running towards him. Her saviour. 


**"to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow."**




And off she goes.



None of that tension exists on screen. And it will suffer for it. But still, Drogon. He's back, finally! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is his involvement in the crowns current financial situation.


This has been talked about a lot on the forums in regards to the book at least, where its more apparent that he's been up to something. But its unclear what exactly. I hope, as Mace and MerrynfckinTrant are in Braavos for a meeting with the bank, more of the realms financial situation will be brought to light, which should also include what LF has been upto.

LFs shrewd financial skills gets discussed a lot, i think on the show, he's praised for it. I'm sure Tyrion gives a line about "making money out of thin air". Which is why a lot of people think he's upto something. Preston Jacobs has done a few vids on the LF debt scheme, which i think has a lot in it. As the show seems to simplify everything, maybe during this meeting something will be revealed along those lines.


LF is pretty much my favourite character, and in the book at least, i'm desperate to know HOW MUCH of a sneaky genius he is.

It makes no sense to be lancel, but i'm not sure that would stop D D. I've heard speculation on Gendry, but really? Not seeing or speaking about him for so long then just to have him back, oh yeah btw no one knows who i am, but i have a claim to the throne? hmmm another stretch.


I don't know. I'm thinking of powerful eligible young bachelors and two come to mind. Robin and Trystane. But how they could effect things in kingslanding is another thing. I would love to see young robin ride back into town, older and fight ready, but if that happens, surely he would be headed for winterfell. As for Trystane, well, i don't know. I'm struggling.

<TEXT> I was so disappointed with this scene. It was such great writing in the book that it was almost impossible to mess up on screen. But no, they found a way.

Seriously, why no 'fetch me a block'? The suspense when he sends him to be hanged, only to stop, equaling huge suspense after hours of reading for this pay off, then bam. 

I will not hang him, said Jon. Bring him here.
The smile that Lord Janos Slynt smiled then had all the sweetness of rancid butter. Until Jon said, Edd, fetch me a block, and unsheathed Longclaw. 

I just. Like. Seriously? Why mess with that scene. wtf are you doing. You've re-written a scene to make it worse. Why?! 


At least the nod was there. Altho even the editing on that was sloppy. ...

The story goes that he asked to sample the track, was denied, so just copied it anyway. Rumours said he payed him off after he called him out on it.  </TEXT>

I've got two, [The wombats - Anti-D] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti1W7Zu8j9k) because i love it anyway, but i'd probs go for [M83 - Outro] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDoEqBas4Y0) Up loud, in a church, must be an experience.

<TITLE> (Spoilers All) As Sophie Turner is hype queen atm, a little thought on Sansa </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-20 20:19:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A thought struck me at how show Sansa might 'die'. Wishful thinking ahead.

I stated in a previous post that i think Sansa is doomed, a pawn, 
who will think shes getting somewhere, before 'exiting' the show. A lot of readers seem place hope in her that she will somehow manipulate her way up the ladder, and i think at least show wise, it will seem this way, less so in the book. But i think LF and Sansa will become a bit of a duo onscreen.

So anyway, the hypequeen herself has previously said she has a 'traumatic scene' and the latest 'slip' (yh right) is that season 5 will end with the "most ambiguous thing ever that happens to her". (The more she speaks, the more it fits in with my long theory that she will mistakingly be killed, which is probs wishful thinking, but anyway, onwards.)



The iron bank will not be happy with LF, he's got the crown into debt they can't afford and is now elbowing (fingering?...) his way into their territory. They will want to punish him, and make a call to the faceless men, who now has our little Arya at their disposal. She's a master sneak at this point and goes about observing. So LF is sat counting his money from all the favours he's earned, he bites down on each coin to check they are gold. Hmmm. 

Later, shes back explaining her actions to, lets say, jaqen. 
However, all that planning didn't count on our Sansa sauntering in to have a chat with LF whilst he's counting his monies. So you see where i'm going with this....
 LF "have a chew on this love" oh dear, red face, poisoned coin,  dead. Or is she? END SCENE. 

So yh, tinfoil. But i really liked that little chapter with arya, and it would be a 'nice' way to include it? </TEXT>

<TITLE> (Spoilers All) Sansa and The Execution Of Lady Jane Grey </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-11 22:32:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There's been a bit of talk of Sansa lately, so i thought i'd add my two bits and share a bloody great piece of art at the same time. Basically, ever since Baelish has got his hands on her, the image of ['Lady Jane Grey'] (http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/PAUL_DELAROCHE_-_Ejecuci%C3%B3n_de_Lady_Jane_Grey_%28National_Gallery_de_Londres,_1834%29.jpg) for me, has become Sansa. or, uh, vice versa. 


A painting, i've seen twice in person, by the great Paul Delaroche. Briefly for those not familiar - Lady Jane grey, known as the nine day queen, has become (mainly through delarache) an icon of doomed innocence. Manipulated into the throne, then beheaded and replaced thanks to her fathers rebellion. Its quite an interesting little [story] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Jane_Grey) and worth a read, as well as a good stare at the painting ;) Many question how sweet and innocent she actually was, but thats the basic image of her now. And thats how i see Sansa, manipulated into power before an enevitable doom not of her doing. All the while oblivious to how shes being used. 
There's something about those hands reached out infront of her, being guided as she reaches for the block. In my head, i forsee a Sansa beheading, to everyones dismay. 


.


So, a lot of people see things in Sansa that i don't think are really there. It seems people want Sansa to get through this story, learn from all thats happened, grow into her 'womanhood' see the light and exact a revenge in the stark name. But, i just don't see it. 

She's been a pawn her entire journey, manipulated by anyone who can use her. Her marriage to joff, held as a hostage, married to Tyrion, and now LF's got his hands on her, finally.
 She's shown kindness from a few, Tyrion, and the hound for example. Tyrion seeing something in her submissiveness that impressed him was an odd one, altho i took it to be her survivavbility. And i think there was a lot of pity in that. Even the hounds interactions were shown to be naive, reading much more into it than it was on her part. She was crushing on any knight who looked at her around that time. And the future doesn't look too bright either. LF's clearly got plans for her, not yet revealed, but we can assume a play for winterfell at some point, which i can't see going well considering who wants and has claims to it.



 Sure GRRM may twist it round an reveal that Sansa has been playing her game as much as anyone else, and it would be cool to see. The way she's portrayed in the show seems to be headed that way. That may be a positive to some, but all i see there is a false hope, that will twist on us just as we think she's getting somewhere. 

So yh, its been a while since i've read the books admittedly, and this may come across as random brain spewings. But basically, rightly or wrongly, i really can't shake the image of Delaroches 'Lady Jane Grey' for our little Sansa Stark.

<TITLE> (Spoilers All) The series overtaking the books? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-23 20:23:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Forgive me if this has been discussed before, cuz it almost certainly will have, but does anyone know if the next series of GoT will definitely overtake the books? 

There seems to be a danger of this in a few storylines. Specifically, i think Littlefingers/Sansa and Brans, whos stories have been tweeked already.  Obviously this would annoy every book reader, so i doubt it would happen, but i guess that means leaving out a few figures in the tv series.

(altho sophie turner hinted at a traumatic scene in the next series. Which in theory, would push her story past the books, as i can't think of any 'trauma' on her arc that we haven't yet seen)

Just wondering if anyone has heard anything else from actors, writers, crew members etc

<DATE> 2014-12-21 13:22:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> is definitively a Targaryen? Am i right in thinking that only Varys knows for certain? 

Illyrio may know, aswell as connington and a few others. But only varys would have known if he smuggled a child out. Clearly Varys is using Aegons claim for his own ends somehow, altho i think what he really wants, is still a mystery. (like i'm really not sure whats driving him if aegon really isnt a targ) So he isnt likely to say otherwise anyway, unless in a pov.

So is there anyone else who would know if the boy really died, or, if the boy was switched with another? 

(I'm of the opinion that Aegon really is a targ and will eventually join with Dany. Mainly becuase its a hell of a lot of writing only to have him as a fake but mainly becuase of Varys. I mean he's pretty smart, but this would be the longest and riskiest long game ever. And why? Whats his motivation if not Targaryen loyalty and legacy?) </TEXT>

<TITLE> (Spoilers All) Arya and Sansas future....tinfoily madness. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-20 20:31:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The more i think about where Aryas story is heading, the more viable possibilities arise. A common thread however, seems to be that it won't be a happy ending.

As i understand it, the story left Arya as a damn good assasin. Working for the people who every big dog goes to when they want someone knocked off. So, this is the most likely way Arya will return to Westeros. The potential hitlist in Westeros has to be pretty big, so heres my theory, based on a few 'facts' but mostly tinfoil.

Right.. The lowborn Petyr Baelish, drizzy draking it up, Lord protector of the vale. Described by varys as one of the most dangerous men in westeros. (Which is why i like him, he's self made. He's not a nice guy, but you don't get to the top being nice. He's basically a crafty little fucker, just like varys. Varys repects him, but fears his potential) Which is why his, apparent, very successful manipulation of Sansa is a big problem. I think i'm right that Sansa is still disguised under the name of Alayne, but tinfoily me, thinks that Varys, having his little birds, knows otherwise, and can predict how Baelish will use her. So, he puts in the call to have her removed from the equation. Not wanting to attack the lord protector of the vale himself and the backlash that might unleash. No one but Baelish will care if 'Alayne' dies.

Back in braavos, sat round the table, the name comes up. Baelish's bastard daughter is up for grabs. Seeing revenge and maybe a pop at Baelish himself, Arya, now very good at lying, denies she knows anyone involved and takes the mark. A long journey and a few chapters later shes managed to get close enough without seeing Sansas face. (Dyed hair remember! yh, right) So, dead of night, sneaky sneaky, oh shit its Sansa! moment. Oops, too late, Baelish just stabbed me in the back.

But wait! Aryas a stark. She's been sleep warging into nymeria forever. (nymerias survived her feast on the freys btw) So when she awakes, there she is, wolfaryia. And what does everyone seem to think they need to get a stark offspring back at winterfell? Yep, there it is. In all its tinfoilyness. Wolfaryia finds Sansa again. Shit happens, she rips Petyrs throat out. She has her revenge. Sansa gets back winterfell, marries. Done.

(btw i quite like the idea that she stabs sansa anyway, only to realise too late that its her, but that would send Arya off running again, and i'm stretching this tinfoil thin as it is)

Theres probs many holes in this theory, so please feel free to point them out. I would love to hear your predictions for Arya, she's got such a long arc, its so hard to see where shes heading.

TL;DR Arya comes back to westeros to kill 'Alayne', realises its Sansa, is killed. Bonds to her direwolf Nymeria.

(btw, this is partly inspired by Sophie turner, who plays sansa in GoT, recent comments that she had a fav, but upsetting scene. I first thought that would be her raping little robin, but i like this one better)

<TITLE> (Spoilers All) Gerion, Brightroar, Lightbringer </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-29 17:15:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> New to this sub, but after finishing the books i couldnt resist. 

One (of many) things that really bugs me is Gerion. It was a massive wtf, learning about another Lannister that sailed off with a huge army never to be seen again. Surely thats cheating, literally, he could sail back in at any point, deus ex machina style to 'save the day' or not as is usually the case. Altho it would be about the right time to come back with a crap load of gold, men and 'weapons' as the lannisters are pretty much in ruins. Either way, its cheating george, you're not allowed to do that.

Anyway. As much as i can tell, he went off towards Valyria in search of brightroar, an ancient sword thats precious to the lannisters, but doesn't say why it is? 

Is it too much of a stretch to posture that Brightroar could be Lightbringer? And Azor Ahai, Gerion, 'Born amidst smoke and salt' (Valyria) ? I think its safe to assume that stannis sword is a fake, but am i right in thinking the lightbringer can be any sword?
 I've seen the theories about Euron possibly intercepting Gerion and the sword etc, but it seems too perfectly set for Gerion to return at some point. 

Any thoughts on this?

Sorry if this is an ident of some another post but i haven't seen it. Would love to hear any theories on Gerion. </TEXT>
