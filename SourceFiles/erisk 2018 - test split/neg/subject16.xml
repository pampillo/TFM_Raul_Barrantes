Also this is kind of funny:
What are they selling?

She lost? So she wields zero political power at the moment? What the hell are people who donate to her charity supposed to be buying? What are the people donating to Bill Gates charity buying? 
She might be doing into shady shit, but lost all relevance when losing the election. She literally can not do anything bad because she has no power.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The espionage order for "Non Ruling Political Parties and Candidates Strategic Election Plans" which targeted Francois Holland, Marine Le Pen and other opposition figures requires obtaining opposition parties' strategies for the election; information on internal party dynamics and rising leaders; efforts to influence and implement political decisions; support from local government officials, government elites or business elites; **views of the United States**; efforts to reach out to other countries, including Germany, U.K., Libya, Israel, Palestine, Syria   Cote d'Ivoire; as well as information about party and candidate funding.

Okay finding out what happens in other countries before it is written in the newspapers is kind of the CIAs mission? 
This is among the least nefarious things an intelligence agency can do.

<TEXT> [This research tested whether support for the killing of animals serves a terror management function. In five studies, death primes caused participants to support the killing of animals more than control primes, unless the participants self-esteem had been elevated (Study 4). This effect was not moderated by gender, preexisting attitudes toward killing animals or animal rights, perceived humananimal similarity, religiosity, political orientation, or by the degree to which the killing was justified. Support for killing animals after subliminal death primes was also associated with an increased sense of power and invulnerability (Study 5). Implications and future directions are discussed.](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167217697092) </TEXT>

<TEXT> NYT report on a five-day convention of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS):

Rather than rock stars, scientists from schools like Johns Hopkins and N.Y.U. were the main attraction, bringing evidence to the medical case for psychedelics like psilocybin (the active ingredient in magic mushrooms) to assuage end-of-life anxiety, to help deepen meditation practices, to search for the shared underpinnings of spiritual life, and  in a new study  to explore a possible treatment for severe depression.

Over 50 years later, the advocates gathered here believe that psychedelic drugs, from LSD to magic mushrooms to MDMA (also known as Ecstasy or Molly), are taking a place in mainstream life. We are not the counterculture, said Rick Doblin, the executive director of MAPS, we are the culture.

The 3,000 or so attendees were a striking mix of ages and types: academics in blazers side by side with a demographic more typically associated with Burning Man than with carpeted conference rooms at the Marriott. They were united by a fierce attachment to the belief that psychedelic drugs, far from being a recreational diversion, have the potential to enlighten, cure illness and change the way people relate to one another and our planet.

So exactly why are we witnessing what many are calling a renaissance in psychedelic drugs now, when theyve been around so long?

There are many theories, including that Big Pharmas solutions to mental illness are not satisfactory to everyone; that the internet is helping to spread knowledge about the power and potential of these drugs; that ayahuasca  the tree-bark tea administered by shamans  has become so popular in certain enclaves in the United States that its helping revive interest in other psychedelics; or simply that baby boomers who discovered the wonders of LSD in the 60s are now facing death, and looking, again, for ways to get in touch with their spirituality.

Reporting probably can not get more descriptive and unbiased as this. No more moral panic at all in credible MSM reporting.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Trump administration ratcheted up the pressure on Senate Republicans on Sunday to solve the policy problems in the House of Representatives' bill repealing Obamacare, urging the upper chamber to improve the bill even while defending its most controversial elements.

The White House dismissed those concerns. Mulvaney said the White House expects the bill to change so much that any score of the House bill would be essentially irrelevant. And Priebus said the administration didnt buy the earlier report that estimated the bill could lead to 24 million fewer people having insurance.

Everyone instantly isnt going to come off insurance, Priebus said. Thats the old bill, thats before the amendments were put in. And its also before the Senate takes the bill and makes it even better. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  As I step off the train in Roquefort, southern France, I sniff the air appreciatively. It's so good to be out of the Paris bubble, meeting some authentic French people to answer the biggest question in European politics: why did so many people vote for Emmanuel Macron? Was it a lack of economic anxiety, or a lack of racism?

Either way, their concerns deserve to be heard. Some might find them unpalatable, but history has taught us that repressing such views only makes them more virulent. It might not be pleasant to hear them, it might offend our sensibilities, but we have to share our towns and cities with pragmatic centrists, so we must strive to understand them. Too often, during this French presidential cycle, an out-of-touch media elite has failed to understand these people, connected to the political process, broadly trusting of the mainstream media, and what has driven them to vote for a liberal, globalising ex-banker who wants to deregulate the economy.

This is quite well written.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Taken together, findings suggest that alcohol is an effective analgesic that delivers clinically-relevant reductions in ratings of pain intensity

I read that pain is a complex construct that includes huge psychological aspects (reason for placebo) and I would speculate that alcohol makes people care less about the nociceptic input they get? So the nervous signal might not be dampened but the interpretation of it changes in a positive way when you are drunk. This may apply to all kinds of pain and may be the reason why drugs are so successful despite huge attempts to curb their use.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer told The Hill in a recent interview that he advocates not showing daily presidential press briefings on live television, arguing "that would cool things down" and lead to less posturing for the cameras.
"I think that would cool things down and calm things down a little bit, and be more old fashioned in the conveyance of information," Fleischer explained. "As opposed to two sides posturing and fighting on air."

On the one hand this statement is probably not false. People put on a show when the cameras are on. On the other hand the Trump administration is so full of liars that there needs to physical evidence every time they say something so that they can not weasel out afterwards.  </TEXT>

So like Trump who golfs all the time because thinking about things like healthcare is [too complicated](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/feb/27/trump-healthcare-complicated-budget-video) and who is so clueless that he thought [the presidency would be easier than his previous work](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-100days-idUSKBN17U0CA)?

You are arguing a straw man. People in here are angry that Trump does not work. He did not bring a single job back. All he does is empty talk. He is a millionaire Reality TV star. He did not do any hard work his whole life. He has absolutely no qualifications for the job. And nothing in his previous life suggests he has any empathy for hard-working people. 
So I am at a loss why you would defend him.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Title does not tell you much, but they interviewed him and this is a great, insightful piece about his first 100 days. 

Some nuggets:
He addressed the idea that his senior aides werent getting along. He called out their names and, one by one, they walked in, each surprised to see reporters in the roomchief of staff Reince Priebus, then chief strategist Steve Bannon, and eventually senior adviser Jared Kushner. The team gets along really, really well, he said.


-

More than 200 of Trumps campaign promises are scribbled in marker on a whiteboard in Steve Bannons West Wing office, which he calls his war room. Other pledges are printed and taped beneath a poster that says: Make America Great Again.

-

In Kushners office, just steps away, theres no Make America Great Again memorabilia. Instead, the whiteboard lists deadlines for bipartisan projects in his newly-founded Office of American Innovation on infrastructure and veterans affairs. Kushner often talks about the presidency like its a business, describing it privately as entrepreneurial and in beta mode. He often doesnt mind when Trump flip-flops, if its in the service of striking a deal.

-

As Trump is beginning to better understand the challengesand the limitsof the presidency, his aides are understanding better how to manage perhaps the most improvisational and free-wheeling president in history. If youre an adviser to him, your job is to help him at the margins, said one Trump confidante. To talk him out of doing crazy things.

-

But theyre learning. One key development: White House aides have figured out that its best not to present Trump with too many competing options when it comes to matters of policy or strategy. Instead, the way to win Trump over, they say, is to present him a single preferred course of action and then walk him through what the outcome could be  and especially how it will play in the press.

-

Of late, some Republican National Committee members have become deeply concerned about Priebus, who was party chairman before joining Trumps team. Priebus, who is distrusted by some rival White House factions and lacks the control previous chiefs of staff have had, has privately complained about the profound frustrations of the job.


-

Since taking office, Trump has 16 times tagged Fox and Friends, the networks morning show, in his tweets, and countless other times weighed in on whatever they were talking about on air. After Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings went on Morning Joe and asked the president to call him, Trump did. After Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher defended Trump in an early Saturday morning Fox News hit, Trump called him moments later, inviting him to an Oval Office meeting. And after news segments, Trump will sometimes call his own advisers to discuss what he saw.

No slight is too small to ignore. West Wing staffers have even fumed about news coverage of the Easter Egg Roll. First, it was that Trumps White House wouldnt be smart enough to pull it off. Then, it was that no one would be there. And after the Easter Egg Roll went off without a hitch, no one wanted to give us any credit, said one senior administration official.

<TEXT> This is a pretty short article that everyone should read. It leads to constant headshaking. 

I am still amazed this guy managed to become the President of the USA. 

He misses driving, feels as if he is in a cocoon, and is surprised how hard his new job is.

President Donald Trump on Thursday reflected on his first 100 days in office with a wistful look at his life before the White House.

"I loved my previous life. I had so many things going," Trump told Reuters in an interview. "This is more work than in my previous life. I thought it would be easier."

A wealthy businessman from New York, Trump assumed public office for the first time when he entered the White House on Jan. 20 after he defeated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in an upset.

More than five months after his victory and two days shy of the 100-day mark of his presidency, the election is still on Trump's mind. Midway through a discussion about Chinese President Xi Jinping, the president paused to hand out copies of what he said were the latest figures from the 2016 electoral map.

"Here, you can take that, that's the final map of the numbers," the Republican president said from his desk in the Oval Office, handing out maps of the United States with areas he won marked in red. "Its pretty good, right? The red is obviously us."

He had copies for each of the three Reuters reporters in the room.

Trump, who said he was accustomed to not having privacy in his "old life," expressed surprise at how little he had now. And he made clear he was still getting used to having 24-hour Secret Service protection and its accompanying constraints.

"You're really into your own little cocoon, because you have such massive protection that you really can't go anywhere," he said.

When the president leaves the White House, it is usually in a limousine or an SUV.

He said he missed being behind the wheel himself.

"I like to drive," he said. "I can't drive any more."

Many things about Trump have not changed from the wheeler-dealer executive and former celebrity reality show host who ran his empire from the 26th floor of Trump Tower in New York and worked the phones incessantly.

He frequently turns to outside friends and former business colleagues for advice and positive reinforcement. Senior aides say they are resigned to it.

The president has been at loggerheads with many news organizations since his election campaign and decided not to attend the White House Correspondents' Dinner in Washington on Saturday because he felt he had been treated unfairly by the media.

"I would come next year, absolutely," Trump said when asked whether he would attend in the future.

Chetty et al. show that this dream did come true for children born in the middle of the 20th century, but only for half of children born in 1984 (see the Policy Forum by Katz and Krueger).

<TEXT> Noch nie wurden in Deutschland so viele Verste gegen das Betubungsmittelgesetz (BtMG) registriert wie im letzten Jahr. Delikte in Bezug auf das BtMG sind in erster Linie reine Kontrolldelikte, das heit, die Zahl der registrierten Delikte hngt vor allem von der Fahndungsintensitt seitens der Polizei ab. Dabei intensiviert die Polzei vor allem die Jagd auf Kiffer. Gem der Kriminalstatistik 2016 des Bundeskriminalamtes, die am 24. April 2017 verffentlicht wurde, stieg im Jahr 2016 die Anzahl der polizeilich registrierten Delikte wegen Verstoes gegen das BtMG im Vergleich zum Vorjahr insgesamt um 7,1%, bei den Delikten in Bezug auf Cannabis insgesamt um 7,9% und bei den allgemeinen Versten (auf den Konsum bezogene Delikte, Besitz kleiner Mengen zum Eigenverbrauch) in Bezug auf Cannabis um 9,9%. Der Anstieg ist deutlich strker ausgefallen im Vergleich zum Vorjahr. Von allen registrierten Delikten im Jahr 2016 in Bezug auf Cannabis entfielen 80,0% auf den Konsum bezogene Delikte. Noch nie war dieser Anteil so hoch, dass heit, noch nie zuvor wurden Kiffer so intensiv von der Polizei verfolgt wie im letzten Jahr. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The whole article is well worth reading. Also it is not too long.
An excerpt:

There is a more disturbing possibility here than pure ignorance: that voters not only do not understand these issues, but also that they simply do not care about them. As his supporters like to point out, Trump makes the right enemies, and thats enough for them. Journalists, scientists, policy wonks  as long as the elites are upset, Trumps voters assume that the administration is doing something right. He makes them uncomfortable, which makes me happy, Ohio Trump voter James Cassidy told the Toronto Stars Daniel Dale. Syria? Korea? Health care reform? Foreign aid? Just so much mumbo-jumbo, the kind of Sunday morning talk-show stuff only coastal elitists care about.

There is a serious danger to American democracy in all this. When voters choose ill-informed grudges and diffuse resentment over the public good, a republic becomes unsustainable. The temperance and prudent reasoning required of representative government gets pushed aside in favor of whatever ignorant idea has seized the public at that moment. The Washington Post recently changed its motto to democracy dies in darkness, a phrase that is not only pretentious but inaccurate. More likely, American democracy will die in dumbness. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Apparently you slowly lose the ability to breath while still being conscious. This supposedly is associated with intense feelings of dread. 

[Severe respiratory depression is impairing and occurs at dangerously high doses of depressants. At this level, a person's breathing rate becomes noticeably slowed down significantly which results in the feeling that one is not adequately moving air in and out of the body. Severe respiratory depression induces a powerful and overwhelming focus point of attention on one's breathing rate. In terms of how this feels physically, it can be described as the feeling that you are breathing abnormally, are short of breath, cannot breathe in enough air, and/or are forced to breathe manually in a conscious effort to feel that you are taking in enough air. Extreme sedation is present and if sleep occurs one may potentially wake up struggling and gasping for air. In cases of GHB overdoses, many reportedly experience an abnormal pattern of breathing characterized by progressively deeper and sometimes faster breathing, followed by a gradual decrease that results in a temporary stop in breathing called an apnea. Confusion and anxiety often occur at this level of heightened awareness, increasing the strong sensation that one's breathing will stop completely due to sleep or a lack of attention.](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you would have read the (rather short) bbc article before commenting:

The way the study, published in the British Medical Journal, was carried out means it is not possible to determine a clear cause and effect.
However, the effect was still there even after adjusting the statistics to remove the effects of other potential explanations like smoking, diet or how heavy people are.


There may be some third variables, but there was an effect that went further than the obvious ones you mentioned.

In the journal article are some of the things mentioned they controlled for:
Analyses were adjusted for sex, age, ethnicity, Townsend deprivation index, comorbidities (longstanding illness, diabetes, hypertension, CVD, cancer, and depression), body mass index (coded as categorical variable based on the World Health Organization classification19), smoking, dietary intake (alcohol, fruit and vegetable, red meat, oily fish, poultry, and processed meat), time spent walking for pleasure, time spent undertaking strenuous sport, time spent in light and heavy DIY, level of occupational physical activity, and sedentary behaviour. 

Also. It is not like the researchers did not think of that:
As is the case for any observational study, residual confounding is always possible and associations may not imply causation. </TEXT>

They have this disclaimer in there, but nevertheless treat it as causation. So they at least tried to control for some obvious confounds.  </TEXT>

But Trump, who came into office with no experience in government, has been unusually unabashed in his reversals. On North Korea, for example, Trump told the Journal that he had shifted his view after meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping last week. After listening for 10 minutes, I realized its not so easy, Trump told the Journal. I felt pretty strongly that they had a tremendous power [over North Korea]  but its not what you would think. </TEXT>

Furthermore I like some data-driven journalism for example by [Ezra Klein](https://twitter.com/ezraklein) who writes vor [Vox](http://www.vox.com/) and [Nate Silver](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538) of [538](https://fivethirtyeight.com/). What I enjoy about them is that it mostly about some data and how it can be interpreted. Some pieces by them are hit or miss, but in general it is good. 

For the political stuff, mostly coming out of Washington I started to like [Politico](http://www.politico.com/). Some of their articles are very into details and some discuss rumors floating around the halls of congress, but if so they are not sold as fact, so I quite enjoy it. 

And finally for the pieces with a lot of background info that go really into depth, I read [The New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/) and [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/).

Obviously it possible to come across a lot of good stuff on reddit, too. Sometimes on the big subreddits, but also in deeper corners like /r/TrueReddit. In the sidebar of /r/TrueReddit you can find some more subs that post more indepth-stories.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Obviously /r/the_donald is a completely different beast in terms of misinformation and shitty journalism. In /r/politics there is sometimes clickbait being upvoted among high quality reports, whereas /r/the_donald is devoid of any journalistic standards at all and the most ridiculous bullshit gets upvoted as long is pushes a certain agenda. They are not comparable, you are right. I guess I instinctly went the CNN way to appeal to everyone. Guilty of false equivalence.

<TEXT> Are you refering to this one?

http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39435786

According to wikipedia your claim that "CNN couldn't help but publish" is not correct:

[On January 10, 2017, CNN reported that classified documents presented to Obama and Trump the previous week included allegations that Russian operatives possess "compromising personal and financial information" about Trump. CNN stated that it would not publish specific details on the memos because it had not "independently corroborated the specific allegations.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump%E2%80%93Russia_dossier)

Or do you refer to something else? Just googled this information. Maybe you mean something different. This certain instance can not be blamed on CNN in my view. Can not judge the accuracy of the BBC report, but the dossier does not seem to be completely baseless. 

Buzzfeed published it, but other journalist did mostly not agree:

[Many news organizations knew about the document in the fall of 2016, before the presidential election, but refused to publish it because they could not independently verify the information.[25] Buzzfeed was harshly criticized for publishing what Washington Post columnist Margaret Sullivan called "scurrilous allegations dressed up as an intelligence report meant to damage Donald Trump"[26] while The New York Times noted that the publication sparked a debate centering around the use of unsubstantiated information from anonymous sources.[27] Buzzfeed's executive staff said the materials were newsworthy because they were "in wide circulation at the highest levels of American government and media" and argued that this justified public release.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump%E2%80%93Russia_dossier)

For me this looks like the main stream media did their job here. The question is whether Buzzfeed was wrong in publishing it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are completely right. I noticed this pattern not only on reddit, but also for comments on newspaper websites. 

Comments always argue against the content of the article no matter what it is about. 

I guess this is a motivational bias. People who agree, click upvote, maybe read the article and move on. People who disagree are much more motivated to tell others why they think the article/conclusion/author/protagonist is shit. 

People are only bothered to put energy into writing a comment if they do not like something. 

So if you look at the comments it gives you a biased view of the opinion of the people. 

It may be the case that people complaining about shitty journalism are not the same as the ones upvoting shitty journalism. But very often the complaints refer to political bias. In that case the "biased" journalism is mostly replaced with even shittier journalism. The only difference being that the second one confirms their political views. 

If everyone who complains about shitty journalism only were to upvote high quality, well sourced, non-sensationlist pieces a lot could be done. This would move ad revenue to those paying for this kind of journalism.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Theres a lot to criticize about Trumps plan for a border wall. It will be enormously expensive, bitterly divisive, and most likely ineffective; it will also slice through Big Bend National Park and other wildlife sanctuaries, disrupting the migration of more than 100 threatened and endangered species. But the reason why many Texans oppose the wall boils down to one simple fact: It will require them to give up their land.

Curious how Trump will try to solve this. Obviously he did not put a shred of thought in this whole wall thing. But someone will have to come up with some ideas on how to handle this. Would be glorious if there would a conservative pro-landowner + anti-wall movement.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reddit likes to lament the decline of journalism all the while mostly upvoting clickbait bullshit "journalism" that has no ethics or fact checks whatsoever. And complaining that some outlets do not report on rumors fast enough when a new story breaks. 

I'd argue the behaviour to upvote articles and therefore generating revenue merely on basis on the headline is the greatest reason for the decline of journalism. It creates an incentive structure in which clickbait makes you money. Thorough research does not. Journalists that do multiple sources checking and non-sensationalist headlines do get drowned in the breaking news /hyperbole bullshit that gets voted to the top. 




Edit:
Just wanted to include one recent positive example of a great, well-researched article. It is a topic you will encounter very often on reddit and mosty with shit sources that push a certain agenda. [It is about Trump and Russia. And more specifically about the tactics Russia applies in foreign politics. 
It lays the facts bare and shows that there is a lot less evidence for collusion than some parts of reddit want you to believe (r/politics), but also there are some connections, (which other parts like like r/the_donald deny). People from both sides of the aisle could learn a lot from it. 
Click here.](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/06/trump-putin-and-the-new-cold-war)

Also from a more conservative outlet, another calm and informative article about the same topic can be found [here](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/446339/donald-trump-russia-2016-election-controversy-explained)

Both of these articles do not much to evoke emotions like clickbait articles do, but they have the advantage of being more likely to be true. They take some time to read. But this is time well spent compared to spitting outraged comments on here in reponse to stuff that turns out to be wrong.

<TEXT> **Submission Statement**

Interesting article that shows contrary to popular believe political polarization is not highest among people who use social media the most (the bubble concept). Old people who are least exposed to social media show the biggest polarization. That means other forces apart from social media bubbles are a more important cause of political polarization. 

Their approach is simple. Using data from the American National Election Survey, they compare the most web-savvy voters (the young, where 80 percent used social media in 2012) and the least web-savvy voters (the old, where fewer than 20 percent used social media in 2012) on nine different tests of political polarization. The measures cover everything from feelings about political parties to ideological consistency to straight-ticket voting, and the data shows how polarization changed among these groups between 1996 and 2012.

The results? On fully eight of the nine measures, polarization increases more for the old than the young. If Facebook is the problem, then how come the problem is worst among those who dont use Facebook?

Does this mean the internet isnt making us more polarized? Not necessarily. The young are becoming more polarized, and its possible social media is part of the reason. But given that older Americans who dont use social media are polarizing faster than younger Americans who do, its clear that this is about more than whom you follow on Twitter. 

Whatever is tearing our politics apart is deeper and more universal than the digital filter bubbles that get so much attention  and it seems to be most powerful among the people least likely to get their news from social media. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While many, including party leaders, have fallen right back into the same anti-Trump pattern they say cost them 2016 in the first place, top Democrats now say theyre working on a strong, sharp-edged, bold economic message, as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer put it Tuesday.

The package will be populist and designed to unite both wings of both caucuses, one senior Democratic aide said. Infrastructure and trade are expected to be key components, another aide confirmed. 

Though Democrats have long diagnosed their failure to put forth a compelling economic message as a root cause of their crushing 2016 losses, their pursuit of a populist package this year reflects the lasting influence of Bernie Sanders presidential bid on their longer-term agenda.

<TEXT> This sounds kind of hopeful:

IA, whose members include Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft, argue that consumers would benefit most from preserving the rules, which Republicans in Congress and at the FCC have indicated a strong interest in rolling back.
The internet industry is uniform in its belief that net neutrality preserves the consumer experience, competition, and innovation online, IA wrote in their ex parte. Consumers want and need their internet experience preserved and protected, regardless of the legal or regulatory mechanism.

But the bad news:

With Republicans having the majority in the House, Senate and at the FCC, there is little stopping them from advancing their agenda against net neutrality.

Democratic lawmakers such as Sens. Brian Schatz (Hawaii) and Edward Markey (Mass.) have countered the Republican perspective in Congress, arguing that preserving net neutrality rules protects consumers from internet service providers who could favor their interests over their customers.

People better get ready to defend net neutrality against Republicans.  We need to show them the costs. They need to suffer in elections and approval ratings for attacking net neutrality.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Ein Werbeverbot - auch ein komplettes - wrde meiner Meinung nach absolut nichts bringen

Da scheint mir die Erfahrung mit dem Tabakwerbeeinschrnkungen eine andere zu sein. 
Zumindest das Werbeverbot beim Sport knnte einer der Grnde fr die sinkende Zahl an Neurauchern sein.

Man wird in Deutschland von klein auf konditioniert den positiv besetzten Sport Fuball mit der Droge Alkohol zu verbinden. Dies war frher bei Formel 1 und Tabak beispielsweise auch der Fall. 

Wie beim Rauchen bringt man durch die Werbeverbote keinen Alkoholiker zum nchtern sein, aber man macht die Droge weniger cool unter Jugendlichen. Man fngt die negativen Auswirkungen sozusagen bei der nchsten Generation ab. 

In der Wissenschaft scheint mir auch der Konsens zu herrschen, dass ein Werbeverbot effektiv wre:

[A systematic review of 13 longitudinal studies of over 38,000 young people found convincing evidence of an impact of media exposure and alcohol advertising on subsequent alcohol use, including initiation of drinking and heavier drinking among existing drinkers.](http://www.clinmed.rcpjournal.org/content/9/2/121.short)

und noch direkter:

[Tobacco control and studies investigating the effect of alcohol advertising bans on consumption and alcohol-related deaths point to the effectiveness of such action - ideally supplemented by other policy interventions.](http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S0256-95742012000700010 script=sci_arttext tlng=es)

<TEXT> Als Bundesminister ist seine Aufgabe auch der Schutz der Verbraucher. Alkohol fordert jhrlich bis zu 74.000 Tote in Deutschland. **60 mal so viele wie alle illegalen Drogen zusammen.** Auerdem wird Alkohol mit vielen Krankheiten in Verbindung gebracht, darunter Speiserhren-, Leber- und Brustkrebs. Handlungsbedarf sieht der Politiker nicht.

-

Deutschland hat ein massives Alkoholproblem: In zehn Jahren ist die Zahl der Alkoholvergiftungen in den Notaufnahmen um ein Drittel gestiegen  auf fast 120.000 pro Jahr. 1,8 Millionen Menschen sind alkoholschtig. Tendenz auch hier: steigend.

Gleichzeitig versenkt man Milliarden in den Krieg gegen die Drogen. Schon abgefuckt das Ganze. Das die Prventionsdinge ja ohne Verbot am Besten funktionieren sieht man an der jhrlich sinkenden Zahl Jugendlichen die neu das Rauchen anfangen. 

Insgesamt aber ein sehr guter Artikel. 

Die Frage am Ende stellt sich mir auch nach dem Lesen:
Am Ende bleibt die Frage, warum sich die Parteien und ihre Spitzen-Persnlichkeiten dafr hergeben, mit Bier und Wein zu posieren. Geht es nur darum, keine Whlerstimmen zu riskieren? Schlielich trinken die Deutschen gerne. Oder steckt doch die Alkohol-Lobby dahinter? Ihr Netzwerk reicht weit in die Politik hinein  brigens auch bei der EU in Brssel. Und vergessen sollte man auch nicht: Viele Bundeslnder besitzen Weingter oder Brauereien. Sie mischen mit in der Branche, die von laxen Regeln seit Jahrzehnten profitiert. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My guess is that Bannon was against the Syria strike, being the isolationist America First guy. 

The Generals and the other globalists on the other hand convinced Trump to go throught with it and demote Bannon. 

Given the huge amount of positive press the airstrike got and the first time that he truly looked presidential I think he will really like that. This may lead to further ousting of everyone who against the intervention and thus could lead to Bannon getting kicked out and Trump becoming a common neoconservative. Which would be really ironic given all his campaign rhethoric.

<TEXT> If you were to read the article you would realize that it is far from "stupid".

On health care Trump's rhethoric was all over the place, basically just showing he has absolutely no idea. This is one of the few areas where his previous statements at least had internal consistency. Which did not keep him from throwing them overboard immediately.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For more evidence that the airstrikes were a departure from Trumps usual rhetoric, look no further than who he is agreeing with: Hillary Clinton. Clinton, speaking at an event in New York earlier on Thursday, had said that the U.S. should attack Syrian airfields. During the campaign, Trump had attacked Clinton as too eager to use military force abroad, constantly dismissing her views on world affairs. Youre going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton, he said in October.

-

Its also not clear how the public will react to Trumps decision. In 2013, a CBS News/New York Times poll found that a majority of Americans (57 percent) said that the U.S. should not launch airstrikes in Syria. A Gallup poll from last year showed that 34 percent of Americans wanted the U.S. more involved in Syria, but a majority said America should either remain at its current level of involvement (29 percent) or do less (30 percent). But both those polls were taken while Obama was in office; partisan views of Obama and Trump may affect how Americans feel about Syria policy, and the photos of children who were killed by the chemical weapons attack could shift public opinion as well.

-

Finally, authorizing military action and then addressing the nation is a big, presidential action, the kind Trump had not yet undertaken. It puts Trump at the center of the action, instead of reacting to Congress, and it complicates the strategy of Democrats, who generally oppose whatever this president proposes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Remarkable to read this on Fox News:

It is the young Trump presidency, however, that takes the biggest hit here. Trump was elected because people across the political spectrum thought he could fix some of our problems. He was the businessman who could import common sense to Washington, and the deal maker who could bring people together. He made big promises; a country tired of stalemate and disappointment believed that he could bring back jobs, reduce our debt, build the wall, find a better healthcare solution.

**His credibility and credentials now lie in tatters.** All that optimism that has stoked the stock market and boosted investment plans  all that may fade. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They do not talk about correlations but relationships. It is quite a bit more complicated than a simple correlation as it factors out different things. 
From their method section:

Latent semantic analysis (LSA)  the technique from natural language processing that weve adapted for this analysis  is often used to determine how related one book, article or speech is to another. The basic idea is that documents using similar words with similar frequency are probably closely related. But what about the words themselves? LSA also allows you to assess how similar words are by looking at the other words that show up around them. So, for example, two words that might rarely show up together (say dog and cat) but often have the same words nearby (such as pet and vet) are deemed closely related. The way this works is that every word in, say, a book is assigned a value based on its co-occurrence with every other word in that book, and the result is a set of vectors  one for each word  that can be compared numerically. On a very technical level, the way you determine how similar two words like dog and cat are is by looking at the angle between their two vectors (theres a visual guide to understanding these concepts below).

You can get their R code here. It is pretty well documented and surprisingly easy to understand (if you have some experience with statistical analysis):
https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/subreddit-algebra

It is fairly straightforward to apply it to other subreddits. They choose to write an article about the_donald, but I guess there are more interesting relationships on reddit that are not political in nature.  </TEXT>

Regardless of the warning, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) said that he will vote no against the American Health Care Act because it does not fully repeal Obamacare. 

I have a lot in common with the president in that we both ran on repealing ObamacareWe [conservatives] ran on repealing it not replacing it with Obamacare Lite and I think Paul Ryans plan wont fix the problems.

<TEXT> Defense Department veterans say the White House has put Mattis is in a nearly impossible position given that large swathe of the Republican foreign-policy establishment was openly critical of Trump during the campaign; Some say that has left Mattis with little choice but to turn to Democrats and to those without a political background to fill senior posts.

In picking Mattis, the president got someone who had bipartisan credibility and was seen as a tough national security official who wasnt going to toe the White House or the GOP line, said Jeremy Bash, a former Pentagon spokesman under Secretary Leon Panetta. Independence is an important attribute in a SecDef. But when you get that, you get frustration from the political folks. When youre not coming out of the establishment, you have the credibility to do bipartisan things. Youre just going to take incoming from Democrats and from Republicans from time to time.

<TEXT> President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, secretly worked for a Russian billionaire to advance the interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin a decade ago and proposed an ambitious political strategy to undermine anti-Russian opposition across former Soviet republics, The Associated Press has learned. The work appears to contradict assertions by the Trump administration and Manafort himself that he never worked for Russian interests.

Okay so they lied about that. Again. 

I did not think too much of the Russian connection at the beginning. But more and more comes to light. And the constant cover-up by Trump and his affiliates makes it seem like there is not just smoke but also fire.

If there was nothing there, why not lay everything that could be construed as incriminating on the table in one go and get it over with?

When it constantly comes out that they lied and tried to cover it up, it makes the whole thing fare more damaging.

It's understandable that the White House would want to distance itself from someone who has reportedly been investigated by the FBI for ties to Russia. But this is a bit much.

 When it comes from a source they otherwise trust it is much harder for Trump supporters to dismiss basic reality.  

I do not argue to support them in general. But whenever they report something like this I think it is way better to upvote for example Fox News and lead the clicks to them, than to click-bait factories like the Independent. 

Obviously not when they report on some reality-bending bullshit Hannity cooked up.  </TEXT>

Das ist mit Verlaub gesagt Bullshit. Trump ist fr jeden der sich auch nur ein bisschen mit Politik ein einschneidendes Erlebnis gewesen und hat alles im negativen Sinne auf den Kopf gestellt. 

Er hat sich bewusst mit Ignoranz gebrstet und jede noch so simple politische Logik durch seine Gefhle ersetzt. 
Das fhrt halt einfach dazu, dass Leute die sich mit dem Thema beschftigen, dem gelinde gesagt kritisch gegenber stehen.

Die Debattenkultur seiner Anhnger hilft sicherlich auch nicht. The_Donald wird ja auch nur durch massivste Zensur   Votemanipulation zusammengehalten. Einfach mal vergleichen wie sich die Anzahl der gelschten Kommentare in politics und the_donald verhlt.  </TEXT>

Joseph Lewis Lori Ellis
David Hicks Christine Russell
Gary Sullivan Pamela Richardson

Weiterhin bezglich der Mohammed Sachen gibt es teilweise auch Forschung. Hier wre ein Beispiel wo es um die Einschtzungen von Geschworenen geht:

[A perpetrator who assaulted an Arabic victim was blamed less than one who assaulted a Caucasian or African American victim, but juror race moderated this effect. This pattern of bias against victims with Arabic names was observed among Latin American jurors but not among Caucasian or African American jurors.](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13218719.2012.736283)

Hier wre noch ein Beispiel in dem sich Schweden in konomischen Szenarien gegenber Leuten unterschiedlich verhalten, je nach Namen:

[The family name of the players was exposed to their co-players. Results for the trust game showed no significant discrimination against co-players with foreign backgrounds. On the other hand, the results for the dictator game showed a statistically significant discriminatory behaviour by men against co-players with non-European backgrounds. The discriminatory behaviour was solely a male phenomenon. In the second experiment, the dictator game was replicated to check the stability of the results in the first experiment. The second experiment also examined whether people with foreign backgrounds discriminate against other people with foreign backgrounds; that is, the purpose was to discover whether discrimination is systematic. The observations in the second experiment underlined the results found in the first experiment: foreign co-players are discriminated against by Swedish players. ]
(http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00036840801964609)

Und um wieder zur Berufsauswahl zurckzukommen. In dieser sehr berhmten Studie wurden Bewerbungen rausgeschickt mit stereotypischen weien und schwarzen Namen (insgesamt 36 Namen). Die gleichen Bewerbungen mit "weien" Namen drauf bekamen 50% mehr Einladungen:

[We study race in the labor market by sending fictitious resumes to help-wanted ads in Boston and Chicago newspapers. To manipulate perceived race, resumes are randomly assigned African-American- or White-sounding names. White names receive 50 percent more callbacks for interviews. Callbacks are also more responsive to resume quality for White names than for African-American ones. The racial gap is uniform across occupation, industry, and employer size. We also find little evidence that employers are inferring social class from the names. Differential treatment by race still appears to still be prominent in the U. S. labor market.]

And again. You can have that without needing to have a private company profit of it. 

Exactly the same service as it is now could be provided by non-profits or by the funding bodies (e.g. foundations like the DFG or the NIH) itself.  The only difference would be that university libraries would not send millions to the bank accounts of the shareholders of Elsevier.

If those funding bodies wanted to censor something, they would not pay for it in the first place, so the argument about politization is completely without merit.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, did not look that up.
I guess I still fail to see how Psilocin is relevant to the basic reasearch finding at hand?
It is nice if it helps some people, but honestly does not really relate to the idea that Serotonin is responsible for cognitive flexibility, does it?

This is pure speculation, but one could argue that the flooding of certain Serotonine receptors under certain drugs leads to too much cognitive flexibility. Which leads to the "great ideas" that some people have under the influence, which turn out to be a lot less genious when you are sober again. 

A counterpoint would be that under MDMA which floods the brain Serotonin you do not have extreme flexibility, but euphoria. People enjoy repetitive music (like house/techno) and sometimes engage in stereotypical behavior. 

So it is definitely not as easy as More Serotonin -- More flexibility. </TEXT>

This is a ridiculous statement, because all this research is already funded by the government. Under the curernt system private companies hide it behind a paywall from the people (taxpayers) who paid for it. 

You are arguing research that is created with government funding is somehow suppressed when a private company is not allowed to profit from it?

Given the recent problems of Uber, that resulted in its president stepping down, looking at alternatives for better business models may be useful. Here is an in-depth article about a start-up called Juno. Their main difference is that they focus on the drivers. This means that drivers get better payment and stock options in the company, so they can decide in which direction the company goes instead of faceless investors. Interesting concept, let's see how it pans out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Researchers end up paying twice for many publications: once for publishing them and again for reading them. DEALs goal, he says, is to move away from subscription fees and toward a model in which the institutes pay a flat fee for article processing charges, so that all publications become fully open access.
The publisher rejects more transparent business models that are based on the publication service and would make publications more openly accessible. Its offer does not comply with the principles of Open Access. Despite its current **profit margin of 40 percent**, the publisher is still intent on pursuing even higher price increases. 

Fuck these publishers. They exploit researchers and leek of taxpayers money, while not providing any service of value and keeping the science that taxpayers payed twice behind paywalls.
The only thing they have is brand recognition of their journals which the individual researchers need for career progression, but does nothing for science in general.
All the while they generate a profit of 40%(!!), which basically no other industry has (maybe the cartells). Because they have exploit researcher they have almost no costs. 
In the interest of science these publishers have to change or to die. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like their study, but I feel like they oversell their conclusions a bit. 

Jumping from this main result of their study:

And then, something happened which the team had not been expecting: right after the rules were changed, there was a second serotonin spike. According to the authors, this increase in the neurons' activity is exclusively due to the "surprise effect" brought about by the sudden reversal of the environmental conditions with which the mice are familiar - and not to any prediction of the outcome. "This spike only appears when the outcome is unexpected", says Sara Matias, "independently of the outcome being for better or for worse"

to this conclusion is quite a leap I believe:
"We think serotonin is not the happiness molecule", says Sara Matias. "It is the neural and behavioral flexibility molecule. It gives us the opportunity to change, but we still have to do something for that change to go in a positive direction. Maybe that's why SSRIs work much better when combined with behavioral psychotherapies than when used alone." 

Cognitive flexibility and its absence is normally associated with Dopamine and there is quite a lot of research about that, so I remain a bit more skeptical than the others, but nevertheless a very interesting study.

<TEXT> A small point concerning the use of evidence. The article does mostly line out that there is no research either way. So it is not evidence that micro aggression do not exist, but just says there is an absence of research supporting the concept. 
Basically a call for more research before we engage in stuff like microaggression training programs. 

To quote the summary:
There is scant dispute that some individuals engage in subtle slights, insults, and snubs against minorities. Nevertheless, the boundaries of the microaggression concept require substantial clarification. At present, they appear to be sufficiently fluid and porous to allow a vast number of potential behaviors, many of which hinge on highly subjective retrospective judgments, to be classified as microaggressions. In addition, the decision about which behaviors to include under the vast microaggression umbrella has in some cases been influenced substantially by embedded political values that have not been adequately explicated. The MRP presumption that certain microaggressions are invariably or usually associated with widely shared implicit messages has yet to be investigated empirically; moreover, this presumption is at variance with large bodies of research and theorizing in social cognition and cognitive-behavioral therapy. The concept of unintentional microaggressions is oxymoronic, as it runs counter to traditional definitions of aggression. Furthermore, there is no evidence that microaggressions are statistically associated with aggression or prejudice in deliverers. Finally, the inclusion of microassaults within the expansive microaggression construct is conceptually dubious and requires further justification. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hab mal google scholar angeschmissen und bin hierdrber gestoen in JAMA:

Methoden:
After randomization, half of
the participants were informed that the drug had a regular price
of $2.50 per pill and half that the price had been discounted to
$0.10 per pill (no reason for the discount was mentioned). All
participants received identical placebo pills and were paid $30.

The protocol followed an established approach for studying
pain. Electrical shocks to the wrist were calibrated to each participants
pain tolerance. After calibration, participants received
the test shocks, rating the pain on a computerized visual analog
scale anchored by the labels no pain at all and the worst
pain imaginable. Participants received all possible shocks in
2.5-V increments between 0 V and their calibrated tolerance.
Stimulation at each intensity level was carried out twice foreach
participant (before and after taking the pill), and the change
in reaction to the stimulation was assessed.Visual analog scale
ratings were converted to a 100-point scale, the postpill score
for each voltage was subtracted fromthe prepill score, and the
mean of these differences was calculated for each participant.

Ergebnisse:
 In the regular-price group, 85.4%(95%confidence interval [CI],
74.6%-96.2%) of the participants experienced a mean pain reduction after taking the pill, vs 61.0% (95% CI, 46.1%-75.9%)
in the low-price (discounted) group (P=.02). Considering all voltages tested, pain reduction was greater for the regular-price pill (P.001). In addition, for 26 of 29 intensities (from 10 to 80 V), mean pain reduction was greater for the regular-price pill.

Diskussion:
These results are consistent with described phenomena of commercial variables affecting quality expectations
and expectations influencing therapeutic efficacy


Der Preis scheint also wirklich eine bedeutsame Rolle fr die Wirksamkeit von Placebos zu spielen. Kann die visuelle Analogskala als abhngige Variable nicht gut einschtzen, aber ein Unterschied von ber 20 % zwischen den Versuchsgruppen erscheint mir doch ziemlich massiv. 

Man beurteile die Studie selbst. Ist in einer der renommiertesten rzte Zeitschrift erschienen (laut wikipedia die weltweit am verbreiteste medizinische Fachzeitschrift) und nicht allzu kompliziert zu lesen (auch nur 2 Seiten):

<TEXT> Smallholder farmers are key to local food security, but their productivity, or lack thereof, is buried when agricultural statistics are discussed at the scale of regions and nations. Household surveys are hampered by errors in self-reporting, and on-the-ground field surveys are constrained by limited personnel. Burke and Lobell combined high-resolution satellite imagery (at the scale of 1 m) with ground-truthed data to estimate yields from maize agriculture in western Kenya, where many of the fields are less than half an acre in size and irregularly shaped. Measurements of canopy greenness captured evidence of nutrient deficiencies. Productivity differed by as much as threefold even between neighboring plots, suggesting opportunities for yield improvement through changes in field management.

<TEXT> But as the Dutch campaign ramped up, Wilders grew much more cautious about invoking the U.S. president. This was no coincidence: By mid-February, when the race in the Netherlands began, Trump had been in office for several weeks, and Dutch voters had gotten a chance to observe him as president. They didnt like what they saw. Its a hard start for Wildershes losing momentum, and this is partly because of Trump, pollster Gijs Rademaker told The Wall Street Journal. Among poll respondents who had backed the PVV in December but no longer did by February, 60 percent thought Trump was doing a bad job.

Wilderss caginess about Trump doesnt seem to have saved him; although PVV gained seats on Wednesday, it fell short of expectations, as well as his own prediction of a surprisingly strong result. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ###Submission Statement
Don't let the headline fool you. It is an insightful article. The GOP ran on conflicting attacks against the ACA. On the one hand the conservative idea that wealth redistribution is bad. And on the other hand that the ACA is bad because not enough people are covered, the deductibles are too high and it is just generally bad health insurance quality wise. It is logically impossible to reconcile those. This leads to the current half-baked compromise with which basically everyone is unhappy. But as the article shows, there is almost no other possible outcome, because of the conflicting platforms they ran on. 

A quote that exemplifies that:

If the idea behind Obamacare was to get everyone covered, said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on the January 8 episode of Face the Nation, thats one of the many failures. In addition to premiums going up, copayments going up, deductibles going up.

In other words, the Affordable Care Act had two big problems: Not enough people were covered by exchange plans, and the coverage they had was too skimpy.

Many Americans who actually did get insurance when they did not have it before have really bad insurance, McConnell continued, sounding like one of ACAs left-wing critics, and the deductibles are so high that its really not worth much to them.

-

The GOP has long had a variety of replacement plans floating around, which differ from one another in important ways. But they all cut taxes and reduce spending. They all end up covering fewer people, and they all end up delivering skimpier coverage to most of the people they do cover. In most cases, they do manage to jigger the costs and benefits around so that there is at least a subset of the population  young, healthy, non-poor people  who end up better off.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like if we could only get rid of all the incompetent people that Trump installed (e.g. Bannon), we could have a fairly "normal" Republican government. Which would be bad, but as bad as the shitshow we have now. 
Trump himself is a buffon with no principles, so I would be totally okay with him doing all the ceremonial stuff. If only there were competent people around him.

<TEXT> That is why they do not state causality in the paper. Just an association. 

They measured people's alcoholism at three time-points during 10 years.
The only measured gray area at the last time point. So these differences may have existed before hand. 

Here is their discussion of the possible causal directions:
There are two possible explanations for the smaller GM volume. The neurotoxic effects of alcohol could have been responsible for the smaller GM. Alternatively, the heavy drinkers may have had an atypical GM developmental trajectory and never reached peak cortical volume compared to light-drinking participants [50]. There is at least some indication that certain genotypes are more susceptible to AUD, and this susceptibility is also manifested as smaller volumes of, for example, amygdala and superior temporal gyrus [22, 23]. Previous research supports the idea that the smaller GM volume of ACC is at least partly congenital [26, 51]. Conversely, a recently published study discovered the GM volumes of frontal and temporal cortices to decrease more rapidly in heavy-drinking adolescents compared to the non-drinking control subjects [27]. In contrast, abstinence from alcohol has been associated with increases in cortical GM volumes, including those in the ACC and insula after 13 months of abstinence [40], which suggests that the possible volumetric changes are at least partly reversible. </TEXT>

Einzelne Ausreier sind selten ein gutes Argument. Intelligente Leute sind im Durchschnitt besser in ihrem Beruf. Die Schulnote ist nicht perfekt, aber einer der besten Prdiktoren fr Studiumserfolg. 
 
Wenn man gute rzte mchte ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit am Hchsten diese zu bekommen, wenn man nach Schulnote aussortiert. Also macht man das. 

Es werden elaborierte Testverfahren von einigen Unis versucht, aber da die Vorhersagekraft derer bisher kaum die von Schulnoten bertrifft ist es relativ fragwrdig ob es wirklich ntig ist diesen Aufwand zu betreiben.

<TEXT> According to Thompson, an industry source put it this way: Paramount is not in the position to take risks. This way, he can make the project he wants. Theres no better indicator of how much the film industry is changing than the fact that a Scorsese gangster film starring De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci seems risky, and Netflix is the safe haven to make the big-budget picture of your dreams. Some of Paramounts upcoming projects might seem, on paper, riskier, such as a sequel to Daddys Home featuring Mel Gibson; certainly, the chances at awards contention are miniscule. But that is the calculation executives made.

 [ ]


Still, it makes sense that these filmmakers would be drawn to Netflix. Ayers experience on Suicide Squad was one that saw Warner Bros. tinkering with different cuts up to the last minute. Bong fought with The Weinstein Company over the length of Snowpiercer, as the famously intrusive producer Harvey Weinstein tried to make it shorter and more accessible to a wider audience. Scorsese has wrestled with such intrusion for most of his career; Netflix is essentially offering him a blank check, and is the rare studio that couldnt care less about running time. The appeal is obvious, and if other artists follow suit and migrate to streaming companies, the impact on theatergoing culture could be profound. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No this is not about subjective experience but about the genetics. They did not find consistent genetic differences between the strains that get labeled as sativa and the ones that get labeled as indica. 
Some indicas are more similar to sativas than other indicas and the other way round. 

If there is not consistent genetic difference this means that the classification of sativa vs. indica has no biological basis. 

It could be based on a consistent experienced difference in psychoactive effects which are not based on the genetics of the plant but on some other variables (e.g. differences in harvesting times). Or the whole indica vs sativa thing is more a placebo-like expectancy effect. 

No one knows because there is so little research into this plant (yet). </TEXT>

<TEXT> This situation contributes to unrealistic, costly, and harmful drug policies. If the real problem with drug addiction, for example, is the interaction between the drug itself and an individual's brain, then the solution to this problem lies in one of two approaches. Either remove the drug from society through policies and law enforcement (for example, drug-free societies) or focus exclusively on the addicted individual's brain as the problem. In both cases, there is neither need for nor interest in understanding the role of socioeconomic factors in maintaining drug use or mediating drug addiction.

The detrimental effects of using law enforcement as a primary means to deal with drug use are well documented. Millions are arrested annually for drug possession and the abhorrent practice of racism flourishes in the enforcement of such policies. In the United States, for example, cannabis possession accounts for nearly half of the 1.5 million annual drug arrests, and blacks are four times more likely to be arrested for cannabis possession than whites, even though both groups use cannabis at similar rates.

An insidious assumption of the diseased brain theory is that any use of certain drugs is considered pathological, even the non-problematic, recreational use that characterizes the experience of the overwhelming majority who ingest these drugs. For example, in a popular US anti-drug campaign, it is implied that one hit of methamphetamine is enough to cause irrevocable damage. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A bit sciency, but very interesting read. 

Most interesting I found these parts:

One result of this is that consumers never really know what theyre buying, even in states where cannabis is legal. Cannabis is sold under names  Sour Diesel, Girl Scout Cookies  that imply standardized varieties, the same way you can buy Xtra Sweet corn or a Bushel Boy tomato. But the science doesnt really work that way, Holmes, Vergara and other scientists said.

Holmess company has an online data visualization showing genetic relationships between samples of cannabis DNA that have been submitted to it by people from all over the world. About 20 percent to 30 percent of the time, he told me, the samples they test wont be even remotely related to other samples sold under the same variety name. Thats similar to results that a Canadian research team got in 2015, when it found that **35 percent of its samples were more genetically similar to samples with a different name than to samples with the same name**. Holmes said that these distinctions can matter to recreational consumers who had a bad experience on a certain variety and want to avoid it in the future.

That also applies to people who are picking their weed based on the broad family categories of sativa and indica. The former is often said to produce highs that make you feel energetic and creative, while the latter is supposedly the stuff that makes you fall asleep on the couch after 15 minutes. But its all just a big myth, Holmes said. And other scientists agreed. The 2015 Canadian study, for instance, found that even though there is some evidence that cannabis could be organized into two families with distinct traits (and even that is the subject of scientific debate), those sativa and indica designations arent really meaningful to the consumer market, because of both cross-breeding that muddies the distinction and simple mistaken identity. **In one case, a variety called Jamaican Lambs Bread, which was supposed to be a sativa, was nearly genetically identical to a supposed indica variety from Afghanistan. Both the names of cannabis varieties and the indica/sativa division should be thought of as fungible marketing, not accurate biology.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> A bit sciency, but very interesting read. 

Most interesting I found these parts:

One result of this is that consumers never really know what theyre buying, even in states where cannabis is legal. Cannabis is sold under names  Sour Diesel, Girl Scout Cookies  that imply standardized varieties, the same way you can buy Xtra Sweet corn or a Bushel Boy tomato. But the science doesnt really work that way, Holmes, Vergara and other scientists said.

Holmess company has an online data visualization showing genetic relationships between samples of cannabis DNA that have been submitted to it by people from all over the world. About 20 percent to 30 percent of the time, he told me, the samples they test wont be even remotely related to other samples sold under the same variety name. Thats similar to results that a Canadian research team got in 2015, when it found that **35 percent of its samples were more genetically similar to samples with a different name than to samples with the same name**. Holmes said that these distinctions can matter to recreational consumers who had a bad experience on a certain variety and want to avoid it in the future.

That also applies to people who are picking their weed based on the broad family categories of sativa and indica. The former is often said to produce highs that make you feel energetic and creative, while the latter is supposedly the stuff that makes you fall asleep on the couch after 15 minutes. But its all just a big myth, Holmes said. And other scientists agreed. The 2015 Canadian study, for instance, found that even though there is some evidence that cannabis could be organized into two families with distinct traits (and even that is the subject of scientific debate), those sativa and indica designations arent really meaningful to the consumer market, because of both cross-breeding that muddies the distinction and simple mistaken identity. **In one case, a variety called Jamaican Lambs Bread, which was supposed to be a sativa, was nearly genetically identical to a supposed indica variety from Afghanistan. Both the names of cannabis varieties and the indica/sativa division should be thought of as fungible marketing, not accurate biology.** </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Tulsi Gabbard

Die ist in der Demokratischen Partei vollkommen bedeutungslos. Die wurde nur von Trump Anhngern die sich als Bernie Supporter darstellen haben mega auf Reddit gepusht.

Und zwar nur deswegen weil sie von allen Demokraten mit Abstand am hufigsten mit den Republikanern gestimmt hat, gegen Hillary hatet und mit Trump zusammenarbeiten wollte.

Hier ein tiefgehender Artikel ber sie:
[She was mentioned as Trumps likely choice for U.S. ambassador to the UNthe job ultimately went to South Carolina Governor Nikki Haleyand even met with him after the November election. Gabbard is reportedly a favorite of Steve Bannon, the former CEO of Breitbart News who now is the president-elects chief strategist. Bannon, who has described Breitbart as a platform for alt-right views, which combine white nationalism and economic populism, has praised Gabbards views on gunsshe supports some gun restrictions, but not others; her alignment with Republican senators on Syrian refugees coming to the U.S.; and, of course, Islamist terrorism. Indeed, Gabbards name was not among the 169 Democratic lawmakers who wrote to Trump criticizing his hiring of Bannon.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/01/tulsi-gabbard-syria/508367/)

Auf gar keinen Fall wird die einzige Person in der Demokratischen Partei die auf Trumps Seite steht als nchster Prsidentschaftskandidat aufgestellt. 

Edit:
Sie wurde wahrscheinlich auch deswegen so gepusht von Trump Anhngern, da sie einen Keil zwischen Hillary Anhnger und Bernie Anhnger getrieben hat. 
Zuflligerweise hat sie einige Beziehungen zu Sheldon Adelson der auch Millionen in die Kampagne von Trump versenkt hat und einige Super PACs gegrndet hat. Vielleicht wird ihr Name deswegen von gewissen Kreisen so positiv verwendet:

[Reps. Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, and Tulsi Gabbard, a Hawaii Democrat, reintroduced an Adelson-backed bill Wednesday, provoking another battle within the deep-pocketed gaming community pitting Adelsons Las Vegas Sands against MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment, which hope to make money online.](http://time.com/3695948/sheldon-adelson-online-gambling/) </TEXT>

<TEXT> The only reason for the existence of this survey is to saw doubt in the minds of people who oppose Trump and reinforce his supporters.

So the ones who share it to "skew the results" play right into their hand. 

All they want you to do is read their "arguments" in the description of the extremely loaded questions. 

Nobody seriously thinks they will bother to release the results? </TEXT>

It is not because of her lies, but because she is irrelevant and has no access to information. 
So why book her if she can not tell you something new? </TEXT>

<TEXT> "I dont even think shes saying something she knows to be untrue, Scarborough said. "Shes just saying things just to get in front of the TV to prove her relevance because behind the scenes shes not in these meetings and any reporter can ask anybody in that White House and they will say the same thing. Shes not in these meetings. So why does the president allow her to keep going out and spreading false information?" 

I mean why should they book her if she is obviously out of the loop and most stuff she says turns out to be wrong?

Either she lies or she genuinely just has no idea what is going. In both cases there is no use in having her on TV.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of the alleged victims was not even in Frankfurt at the time the allegations are said to have taken place.

Before the Bild report, no sexual assaults were reported to police from Fressgass over New Year.

The sad thing is that obvious bullshit gets picked up by newspapers because right-wingers demand it. 

How about only reporting the truth and not what some people want to hear? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love how he calls it simultaneously ["fake news"](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/831830548565852160) and ["illegal leaks"](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/831840306161123328). 

How can it be both? Either the story is incorrect, then it can not be a leak, or it is truely leaked then it can not be "fake news". 

It is logically impossible for both his statements to be true. So one has to be a lie. Maybe even both.

<TEXT> It is physiological (in)tolerance.

See the article:

Our sample (48.6% female) is drawn from the Han Chinese undergraduate population at a leading Chinese university. Members of our sample are similar in age and background: homogeneity of the participant pool is the reason we use this population. We are aware of no evidence that alcohol intolerance is associated with personality or preferences, and in our sample we find no evidence that this polymorphism systematically predicts personality type, attitudes toward risk, or prosociality. Other than alcohol intolerance and gender, both of which are expected to impact systematically use of self-control, we are aware of no other reason or evidence that practice of self-control would differ systematically among this population. 

**Alcohol intolerance arises because of the presence of the ALDH2 Lys487 allele (see SI Appendix for details).** Since there is an equal chance that either parental allele will be passed on to offspring, alcohol intolerance can be understood as occurring randomly in the population (22). This randomization across our sample is crucial for the causal inferences we report below. Note that our research strategy connects to the Mendelian randomization literature (2326), which also takes advantage of natural experiments implied by random assignments of genes from parents to offspring.

Trump has extensive business dealings with Saudi Arabia, that are much more pronounced than Clinton's. 

It was clear that he will not get rid of that, despite all his statements. He just does not care about the optics at all. His own financial well-being is more important than his political promise. And money is one thing the Saudis have way more of than he has.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Senate Democrats will unveil a $1 trillion infrastructure plan  and offer President Trump their support if he backs it.

From our largest cities to our smallest towns, communities across the country are struggling to meet the challenges of aging infrastructure, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, will say. Our urban and rural communities have their own unique set of infrastructure priorities, and this proposal would provide funding to address those needed upgrades that go beyond the traditional road and bridge repair.

Republicans resisted President Barack Obamas push for an infrastructure surge for eight years, arguing that the federal government couldnt afford it and that state and local governments should shoulder more responsibility for improvements. But Mr. Trump has taken up the Democratic cause.

We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation, he vowed in his Inaugural Address.


Let's see what his answer is. Republicans will hate this plan.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Conspiracy theory is widely acknowledged to be a loaded term. Politicians use it to mock and dismiss allegations against them, while philosophers and political scientists warn that it could be used as a rhetorical weapon to pathologize dissent. In two empirical studies conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk, I present an initial examination of whether this concern is justified. In Experiment 1, 150 participants judged a list of historical and speculative theories to be no less likely when they were labeled conspiracy theories than when they were labeled ideas. In Experiment 2 (N=802), participants who read a news article about fictitious corruption allegations endorsed those allegations no more than participants who saw them labeled conspiracy theories. The lack of an effect of the conspiracy-theory label in both experiments was unexpected and may be due to a romanticized image of conspiracy theories in popular media or a dilution of the term to include mundane speculation regarding corruption and political intrigue.
