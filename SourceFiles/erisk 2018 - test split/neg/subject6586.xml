<TITLE> Generative Linguistics workshop and discussion with Noam Chomsky and others, streamed live online </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-08 14:28:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> On Thursday 11 May we will be welcoming a number of renowned linguistics to the University of Reading for a workshop on 'Generative Linguistics in the 21st Century: The Evidence and the Rhetoric', hosted by the School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences. 

The workshop features a keynote talk by Professor Chomsky and plenaries from 9 other renowned linguists, including Professor Adriana Belleti, Professor Hagit Borer, Professor Stephen Crain, Professor Tanja Kupisch, Professor Terje Lohndal, Professor Luigi Rizzi, Professor Ian Roberts, Professor Ianthi Tsimpli, and Professor Charles Yang. All working on formal linguistic theory and its application to acquisition and processing in children and adult learners. The day culminates in a moderated panel discussion with all our invited speakers, where audience members can ask questions.
	
The purpose of this workshop is to present and consider the evidence that still points in this direction, while at the same time sifting through and seriously considering the rhetoric that in recent years has rejected the general tenets of generative linguistics. In doing so, we will examine the role of generative linguistics at present and consider where it will be going as the 21st century unfolds. 

The entire workshop will be filmed and made available online, but **Professor Chomsky's presentation and the final panel discussion will be streamed live on the University of Reading's Facebook page** from 1530 BST: http://rdg.ac/2pOokcB  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of our Classics Professors has a new free online course coming out which might be interesting: http://rdg.ac/FLvirtualrome 

He's using his own award-winning virtual model of ancient Rome to show what the city would have been like at its peak, and to try and answer some common questions: 

Why was this ancient city built where it was? Did all roads really lead to Rome? How was drinking water supplied to the citys million inhabitants? Where did Romans worship their gods and meet their political masters? And which buildings provided a backdrop for the spectacular events that both celebrated emperors and secured the loyalty of the masses?

He's also keen to take part in an AMA, so let us know if you're interested in talking to him here in the community!

<TEXT> Hi, were /u/DrManabuSakamoto and /u/DrChrisVenditti from the University of Reading in England. Manabu is the lead researcher, and Chris is a co-author, of this paper showing evolutionary decline in dinosaurs long before the meteorite which finished them off.

Read the full paper here: http://rdg.ac/1pbZM9j.
