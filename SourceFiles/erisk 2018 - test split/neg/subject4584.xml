<TEXT> If Kennedy steps down and Trump replaces him, we are doomed for the foreseeable future. There are more than a few justices who are getting old and want to retire. Ginsburg wanted to retire, but Obama talked her out of it because he knew he would never get a replacement through congress.

<TEXT> This part of the whole thing is amazing to me. It's the most unprofessional thing I've seen the White House do so far. It's actually just bizarre, but I can imagine Trump screaming that they have to do it NOW, and them trying to tell him he needs to fire Comey in person, but he won't listen. I wonder which one of his aliases leaked it to Fox News before Comey even knew? 

I cannot even fathom the level of ignorance and petulance and stupidity of people who would do this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was watching a video from a woman who sells erotic romance on Amazon and she says she has no problem getting them written or .01 a word. I know only one person who writes them, and they are absolute crap. She knows they are absolute crap, but she says she can crank one out in less than a day and she has never had a rewrite request. The woman who sells them says the first one she got back was horrible, but she put it up on Amazon, and people bought it for $2.99. I equate this to those horrid little Harlequin romance novels people used to eat up like candy. 

Personally, I could not be responsible for flooding the market with crap books and taking advantage of people so bored with their life that they would pay $2.99 for them over and over again, but if your only goal is to make money, I guess that's one way to do it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're taking it all too seriously. What I find is that the better writers who have done high-end writing, or are seriously educated, tend to not be able to dumb themselves down to content mill level. I was one of those for a long time, fighting to increase the standards of content mill work. Now I just crank it out. Seriously, like /u/workathomewriter says, it's mostly just rewriting the first good link you find. 

After doing this for 9 years, I would never submit a free article to a website in an application. That just screams scam right there. They probably take those 2,000 word articles, break them up into 4 or 5 shorter articles and sell them for $50 apiece to their clients. 

And you just wasted a lot of time writing this long post. If you're going to make it in content mill world, I'd say you are going to have to understand what they are and how to make money on them at 3 to 5 CPW. You have to learn to crank out work quickly, and screw the quality. They want stuff written to an 8th grade level. 

If you take yourself and your writing this seriously, I'd suggest writing on spec at Constant Content where you can charge whatever you want, but first, read a few online articles from not-so-intellectual sites so you can learn that what most website owners (99% of whom are affiliate marketers) want is crap. Cheap crap with keywords that make them money. Trying to produce quality work is a waste of time, and intellectualizing content mill writing is a waste of your brain.  </TEXT>

Would it help to know exactly what business interests he has all over the world and who he owes money to? Maybe, but any agency that does that now will be accused of doing it in retribution.

<TEXT> I'd be a blue dog if they still existed. I'm way too fiscally conservative for most of even my more moderate democratic friends. 

What has happened (read something about this the other day) is that right-wing media and right-wing pundits have been using the word "liberal" in a negative way for so long, that it is a curse word to the right now. Actually, most dems aren't liberals. Liberals are to the left of strict democrats and to the right of socialists. Bernie is a liberal. Schumer is a democrat. God only knows what Nancy Pelosi and Hillary are. They are hybrid creatures of another God.

BTW, right-wing media did that on purpose. "Liberal" is one of their buzzwords that has been repeated so much it is now used as a weapon. "Libtards, Lefties, Leftists" are other words they use over and over to make dems look bad.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> ADDICTION isn't a choice, but whether you give in to it is a choice. Some people are strong enough to fight it, some aren't. I've been to AA meetings, in fact, I was a member of Al-Anon for 30 years. Like I said, everyone in my family was/is addicted to either alcohol or drugs. Nobody ever held them down and forced alcohol and drugs on them, and they all quit several times, so yes, it's a choice. Some people choose to not give in to the addiction, some choose to stay addicted. I didn't say it was an easy choice, but it's still a choice. When you're sitting there with that bottle of beer or shot of liquor in your hand, it's your choice whether to drink it. Your body may be saying you "need" it, but it's still your choice. If it wasn't, there wouldn't be an AA. They make that choice every day NOT to drink, or to give in.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It also depends on what they are writing. Technical writing pays way more, and marketing copy pays way more. I have a friend who writes sales copy and she makes six figures working basically 20-30 hours a week. Of course, you have to be really good and get results. I know SEO writers who can draw in traffic like mad who make almost as much. 

Of course, there are also those who, like you, consider 10 CPW "a good rate" and will never ask for more. Let me just give you one example of how asking for what you are worth can work. One friend was working through a bidding site for 2 CPW writing quick little 400 words articles. She decided that wasn't enough, so she told the client she could no longer write them, because she was raising her rate to 5 CPW. He immedately told her he would pay her  price, and not much later raised it to 7 CPW. When she finally did quit because she just couldn't think of anything else to write on the topic, he told her his budget was 10 CPW. If she had asked for 10 CPW when she raised her rates the first time, he would have paid it.

The thing about asking for what you are worth is that you will have to bid more or market yourself more or try harder to get jobs, but it's like every other job. There are fewer employers paying that rate, but it's worth holding out. 

The key is not to tell anyone you are working for less to keep the lights on. Clients know that. They aren't stupid, but they also know that they get what they pay for. Some don't care about quality, just traffic. They open hundreds of crap sites and stick up crap copy loaded with keywords and ads. They work in volume. Then there are those clients who create quality sites and want quality copy. They are looking for expert status. These are the ones you want to work for.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, we need to define "ignorant asshole?" Got it. 

Some of it would be easy, though. Recreational addicts vs. those addicted due to pain or injury. There would be a trail to follow to find out which is which. 

The hardest would be all the "subjective disorders," like fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, etc., since there is a complete cottage industry of doctors recommending disability for people who don't really need it. I'm not saying those are fake disorders, because I have lupus, so I get both as a package deal. The problem is, you can't prove or disprove lupus or any of it's many adjunct disorders. It's a subjective diagnosis. 

I'd hate to see people like me denied coverage because some disability-mill doctor is giving out diagnoses right and left. That's a hard one.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So maybe if I segregate them from the actual personal posts, they might not annoy the regular readers who expect my personal touch so much. Or maybe if I do small ones stuck into the middle of a personal post, much like I do images now. I'll see what is available and see if there is a way I can use them.

For example, I do a post every month on what to do in the garden that month. It has tables with lists of things. Maybe replace those with infographics of those things instead for the more visual people, while the rest of the post is still very personal? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe so. Maybe I'm wrong. I'm just stating how I feel about the entire scenario. I don't have solutions. I'll give you an analogy I can understand, though. It's like killing insects in your garden. If you look at a plant and see a whole lot of aphids and a whole lot of red and black bugs, you'd think you need to get rid of them all. The truth is, the red and black bugs are probably ladybug larvae that are eating the aphids. Kill them all and the aphids come back, but now there are no ladybug larvae to eat them, so they kill the plants. It's hard to tell the good from the bad sometimes. Say there is a vet who is also addicted to painkillers because of injuries he received overseas during a war. Do you lump him in with all the street junkies who just like to get high simply because he's an addict? 

Also, in my scenario (and this is something I have considered) a shitton of Native Americans would not get health care because of alcohol and drug addiction, so catch 22. </TEXT>

Here's a whole page that defines addiction in detail. Read and learn. All addictions have the same characteristics in common that separate them from compulsions.

<TEXT> I don't know the solution. I just know we can't keep paying through the nose for people who destroy their own lives. Where does it end? There isn't enough money in the world to set this to rights. I was watching a video just yesterday of some radio show (I forget which), where a self-professed "welfare queen" called in to say why should she work when the government would take care of her? Also, she made the point that if she worked, all her money would go to child care. What do we do about that? She knows she can get cared for, that her kids can get cared for, that they all have medical care, but me -- I didn't have medical care for 9 years, first due to pre-existing conditons and then because my state didn't expand Medicaid. She also had a husband who didn't work except to pay for his own bad habits (alcohol   cigarettes). Why do they get medical care when I, who have done nothing wrong and worked most of my life, can't? Hell, the crackhead next door to me gets disability, housing vouchers and food stamps, and he's still doing crack and begging me for food when he sells his food stamps for crack and can't eat. I refuse to feed him. This is what I'm suggesting we do to them. Just stop feeding them -- stop feeding their addictions. Yes, people will die, but maybe -- just maybe -- people like me won't. And yes, I think I deserve to live more than he does. If that makes me hateful, then I'm hateful, but that's what I truly believe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do. My genes make me an addict. Right now, I'm addicted to sugar. I ate a whole bag of jelly beans yesterday, telling myself the whole time to throw them out and not eat them. No, it's not liquor or heroin, but it's just as much an addiction, and I fight it every day. I am also addicted to the internet. When the web goes down, as it sometimes does, I go insane. I mean really insane. I can't stand the thought of being disconnected. I'm also addicted to gardening. I can't stop. I used to be so bad when I had more space that I would end up giving away literal pickup truck loads of plants, and still had too many. I'm also addicted to television, to the detriment of my work life. I work at home, and I have not made a single penny in the past week because of watching t.v. and being on reddit. Now Sense8's new season just came out, and I will spend my entire weekend watching it. I can't stop. I try to, but I can't. 

I get just as high from these things as you do from drugs or alcohol or whatever you are addicted to, and they all affect my life and relationships negatively, but I can't stop. I count myself blessed that I'm not addicted to alcohol and drugs like everyone else in my family -- or food, like my nephew, who died from pancreatic cancer from diabetes caused by his weight, which was over 400 lbs., but I still know what it's like to get up every day and VOW to myself that "today, I'm going to work. I'm not going to watch t.v." and then fail at that over and over and over. I swear to myself every day I'm not going on reddit, but I do over and over and over. I swear to myself I'm not eating sugar, and I do over and over and over. Sometimes I feel so out of control and helpless, so yes, I do understand addiction. My husband was a drug addict and alcoholic. I watched him struggle. I watched my mother and father struggle. I walked away from my alcoholic drug-addicted sister because I couldn't stand to see one more person die from that disease. 

Will my addictions kill me? Maybe the sugar addiction. My grandmother, who didn't drink, died of liver cancer. The doctor said it was from eating too much sugar. You see, it isn't the alcohol that kills your liver. Your body burns that off very quickly. It's the sugar.

<TEXT> So could we at least agree that a life-long alcoholic with liver disease could be denied coverage while someone who has gotten liver disease because their irresponsible asshole husband went out and screwed a prostitute who gave them Hep C should be covered? Should we punish their child born with Hep C due to his irresponsible behavior? 

The children are the ones that keep me awake at night. How do we punish a child for being born with a genetic condition because her parents chose to ignore the warning markers before they got pregnant? How do we deny coverage to crack babies, who are born addicted through no fault of their own? 

I don't want to punish people, especially not children, but I don't want to reward people for bad behavior either.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be totally honest here, without purposely sounding insensitive, I happen to know that people can get on disability due to the damage that something like alcoholism or drug addiction has done to their bodies, and a great many of them use those disability checks to carry on with their bad habits. I know addiction is a disease (grew up in an alcoholic family), but it's a disease you have control over if you want to. You don't have to drink or do drugs. I know the compulsion is strong, and it's a tough choice, but when it comes down to it, it's still a choice. My entire family are alcoholics, but I'm not. I have every bad gene they ever could have passed down but I CHOSE not to drink to excess and I CHOSE not to smoke myself to an early grave like a lot of my relatives did. I CHOSE not to eat like a pig and end up at 300 lbs. dying of heart disease. I've never understood why the government rewards bad behavior. I guess the same could be said about women who have child after child with multiple men just to get more welfare. 

I'm not stupid. I know all the excuses these people give and I know that I sound insensitive to some people, but if I'm going to be a fucking asshole, it will be to someone who made the choice to ruin their body and not to a child who is born with a bad heart or some other disease, or someone who has diseases commonly associated with aging, such as arthritis or heart and lung problems, that were NOT caused by an irresponsible lifestyle. There has to be a line somewhere that needs to be solid and bright and that people are aware that crossing it may cause you to have no medical care if you proceed to ruin your body. When do we get to say "no?" without being called hateful and mean and any other list of horrible adjectives?

And this is why my friends call me a demopublican. Sometimes I thinks dems have just blinded themselves to common fucking sense. They sometimes remind me of those kids who will do anything to be popular, even if it goes against every form of logic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Worse yet, many professionals have said he is a malignant narcissist. The difference is that malignant narcissists ENJOY hurting other people. Sociopaths just think the rules don't apply to them. They are usually very disorganized. Malignant narcissists are more dangerous, because they may appear disorganized, but everything they do has a purpose. They are vengeful and literally get off on watching those they consider enemies suffer. ETA: Which in Trump's case is more than half of the American public who did not vote for him.

<TEXT> If you are a finance expert, you should be able to get much more than 10 CPW on a regular basis. I have a CPA friend who won't write articles on high finance for less than 20 CPW. If you don't have a degree or credentials, it might be harder. 

I do agree with finding micro-niches within the finance niche. For example, there is a huge audience for permaculture that is rapidly growing. A lot of those people are looking to make money at it, so you could write cost analysis of permaculture farming vs. conventional farming, or articles on how to get approved to buy property for permaculture (for some reason, banks don't like this idea, but they'll loan to conventional farms). I'd aim those articles at bankers, outlining why it would be beneficial for them to loan to permaculture operations.

Niches like solar and wind power also need cost/benefit analysis articles. If someone is planning to put up solar on their house, for instance, how much will they be able to recoup if they have to sell, or how much over time will the setup pay for itself? While a lot of this info is out there, it's mostly dated, so updated stats would be valuable to someone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a gardening blog, and I'm going to start putting affiliate ads on it. I have Adsense up, and I'm an Amazon and eBay affiliate, so I'm going to start there, then search for better ones. I get about 3,000 visits a month, which I know isn't much.

Mostly, I've been posting about personal gardening with a few how-to posts. I'm going to start doing many more how-to posts and some plant profiles as well. I'm in Florida, so it's already a niche blog, since we have such strange gardening down here (we literally are gardening the same time as Aussies). 

I also want to tie in some outdoor living and design content, so I can pitch higher priced items. 

Does anyone have any tips on using Amazon and eBay, or even how to get better paying adsense ads? A link to a site or book recommendation would be fine too, although I've read so many affiliate marketing books, I feel like I"m in overload. 

TIA

Then you have to write to Google and ask them to remove it from search, so you can put it up or resell it without it being flagged as duplicate content. ETA: Also, mention that you will be posting her name and information all over social media, and also report her to LinkedIn.

Also, search whois.net to find out who her domain provider is. Put a DMCA complaint in to them as well, saying she is using their domain for plagiarized copy. It may do nothing, but you can also find out who her webhost is and write to them.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've changed my life completely in the past 9 years; went from a corporate retail job to being a freelance writer, moved from a 3/2/1 house to eventually this 520 sf apartment. I went from 1/4 acre lot to about 250 sf of garden space. I no longer own a car, so walk, bus and ride a bike (hadn't been on one in 20 years before this) everywhere. I spend less then $200 a month for food most months. I have very, very few clothes (down from two closets full previously), one good pair of jeans, and one good pair of walking shoes. 

Yesterday, I got tired of washing eating utensils, so I put away all but 2 of everything except I kept out 9 spoons, because that's mostly what I eat with. I don't really need 9 spoons, but I don't want to have to keep washing them all day, so 9 it is. 

I share a small community garden plot close by, and I've gotten to where I hate going there, because it's just one more chore I have to do. I had huge plans for planting my courtyard but instead, I've decided to lay out an area for a few favorite plants, then fill the rest in with mulch because it's just something I have no interest in anymore. 

I sometimes pick up things I think I'll eventually need or can use from beside the apartment dumpsters, but lately, I've been taking dumpster finds back out to the dumpster, because I want space more than I want stuff. 

I think a lot about getting rid of it all and going to live in a van, traveling around the country, because I've never really seen the U.S. due to no money to travel. I don't know how long I could do that, but every time I have to do a deep clean of the apartment because it's gotten a little out of hand, I think how nice it must be only to have a tiny little van full of the essentials of life. Just now, while I was watering my indoor plants, I thought "I should just give all of these away. What good are they to me, really?" Plants and gardening used to be my life, and now it just seems like work.

It's all just so much to take care of! My neighbor was shocked I don't have a washer and dryer, and I told her it's just one more thing to break and have to get fixed. She didn't understand how I can stand going to the laundry room to do my laundry, but I explained to her that I have so few clothes and linens now that I can do it all in two loads once a week. I wish I could do it in one. If I lived in a van, I could do it in one.

I look at everything in here every day and think "I don't need this or that or that or ..." you get the idea. I have 5 frying pans. Who the hell needs 5 frying pans? I used to love my things, and to a point, I still do, but more and more, they are just things to take care of and things that require space that I don't want to clean and take care of. If I didn't have all these things, I wouldn't need all this space. 

Am I going insane, or does anyone else feel this way?

<TEXT> I moved 5 times in 5 years. I have gone from a 3/2/1 house on 1/4 acre, with one room and a garage I could not walk into, to this 520sf apartment with a small courtyard. I have sold, given away, had stolen, or just left behind things in every place I lived (except a temporary 3-month rental while I looked for a place.) I still can't sleep in my BR because it is piled with boxes -- and I do mean piled. The room is 14 x 11, and I literally have a pile of boxes in about an 8x10 ft area almost up to the ceiling, and I've been here 2 years in July. I guess you can say it's taken me 7 years to get to this point, and I'm determined to be in that bedroom with NO boxes outside of closets by Christmas.

Sometimes, I think of the things I no longer own and I don't have a clue why I thought I needed them. I only miss one thing -- my grandmother's wool blanket which was stolen from me, which I inherited when she died when I was 15 years old. That still makes me furious to this day, that someone would steal that from me, and I know who did it too, but can't prove it, because she took it somewhere and hid it. She stole a lot of things from me. That's the only thing I miss.

Right now, when I go through boxes, I look at things and say "Am I going to use this in the next year?" Some of those things in that room have been packed up since 1996. Some of them are important, but mostly, I don't even know what is in all those boxes. I carried around boxes of Christmas lights and ornaments for years, even though I stopped celebrating Christmas 15 years ago. I have no idea why. I don't know if I still have those boxes, but if I do, they will all be donated.

I guess the point of all this is that the further you get into the process, the more you realize that you don't need. I stare at a bookshelf full of books in my LR every day and think that I really should just give all those books away. I'm never going to read them again. I don't know why I kept these particular books when I got rid of hundreds of others, but here they are, and they are going to be pared down drastically very soon.

It's a process. Some do it quickly so they won't change their minds. Some give thought and consideration to every single item. You do you. We can't tell you how that should work.

<TEXT> Which is why I hesitate to leave this college town, but even here, rents are getting crazy. All the new apartments they are building are high-end. The most affordable apartments are around $600-700 for a 1 BR in older complexes with lots of mold and maintenance problems. I lucked up with this place. 1 story quad, my own courtyard and outside gardens, great manager, great maintenace, pretty low utilities (garbage is paid for saving me $25 a month) and cheap rent. Of course, there is no pool, tennis courts, dog park, etc. here, but I don't need those things. 

It also depends on what part of town you live in. Downtown, this same size apartment in the historic district is $800 with no utilities furnished. I would really love to live in that neighborhood if I could afford to, but until then, this works really well for me. </TEXT>

The only problem is that it is pretty cold in the winter because of a stream out in the Pacific, unless you go to Baja Sur, which is a bit more expensive, but still pretty great. You have two coasts to choose from, just like Florida, with each having a different feel.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> And every one of those things was done by Democrats. The entire south was democratic, including the racists, before 1964, so the dems aren't completely innocent in this. They had no choice but to play to minorities once they passed the Civil Rights Act and the Republicans picked off the racists. Pretty much before 1964, all white people in America were racists. After 1964, you had to pick a side. More intelligent, well-meaning people picked the democrats. Before then, the Republicans were the party of the intellectual and financial elite, the fat cats. Now they are the party of the underclass, because they saw an opportunity to gain voters they could easily manipulate (less educated, more prejudiced). The democrats were left with what they have now, minorities and more educated voters. They didn't ask for these people, it's all they had. They were the KKK party before then, so don't paint such a rosy picture of the dems. I'm telling you, a lot of them would love to vote for Trump's immigration policies, but they don't have a choice with the voters they were left with after 1964. They talk a good game, but they aren't as wonderful and accepting as you may think. Look at Clinton's crime bill, and what Hillary said about black gangs being "predators." They knew that bill would disproportionately affect black youth, especially young black men. Nobody went after the Russian gangs, who truly are predators. But what do you expect from a poor boy from Arkansas? 

No, dems aren't so perfect. Underneath, they are all the same, just playing to different bases. The Republicans did what they did in 1964 because they saw an opportunity to take over the South and become a prominent party again. And they did. Now they're stuck in a quagmire of their own device. But hey, they got the South back, right?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I guess so. I have a friend who lives in the desert and she pays next to nothing, but it's the damned desert. Also, what do you consider affordable? I pay less than $600 for a nice 600 sf 1-br with a large courtyard and porch here, walking distance to shopping with buses leaving every 10-15 minutes to go wherever I want to go. I'm willing to bet you can't get that in Cali anywhere -- well, except in the desert, maybe. My friend pays $800 for a 2 BR on about an acre of sagebrush and cactus.  </TEXT>

She chose a VP candidate who is a racist and has hated white people for years, yet she was asking a whole lot of white people to vote for her. 

You have to be careful not only what you do, but who you associate yourself with. Look at the whole Russia problem. Maybe Trump was involved, maybe he wasn't, but by naming a lot of people who were involved wth Russia to his cabinet and as advisors, he paints himself with the same brush.

<TEXT> That's why I said "During the school year." The seats would be taken quickly by students before the red guard could move in. If anybody hates Trump, it's most of them. Yes, there are conservative students, but they are mostly liberals. UF is a very liberal college, and Gainesville by-and-large is a dot of blue in a sea of red.

The problem would be he would only advertise the rally to the rural areas where his supporters are. I see him more likely to have a rally  in some place friendlier overall, because even if we couldn't all get seats, we would be outside protesting.

Besides, I don't see the university letting him use the stadium, do you? So where would he rally? </TEXT>

<TEXT> And don't forget that most people who fall into that 50-64 age group have pre-existing conditions, so if he hurts them, the AARP and all senior groups are going to come down on him  and congress like stink on shit. Most people don't realize how powerful the AARP is, but it's not just people over 65. You can join in your 40s (not sure of this age) as long as your parent is a member. It's HUGE and well-supported and has beat back every attempt to do away with just about anything that applies to SS, Medicare, Medicaid subsidies, and anything else that pertains to seniors. They are a big part of why pre-existing got into Obamacare in the first place, otherwise, most of their 50-64 members would have been locked out. 

Once most of the boomers die off, it may not be as powerful, but right now, it's a big dog and a hard one to fight. </TEXT>

The other day Tucker Carlson mentioned disability as being where the long-term unemployed turned who don't qualify for welfare (no kids, etc.). Do you have any idea how many of his able-bodied but unemployed people are on disability? I do. I grew up with them.

<TEXT> Which is exactly why these idiots who put everything they do on YouTube and shows like "Extreme Preppers" will be the first to die. 

I was raised with guns in a family of farmers and hunters. You don't have to be a right-winger to know how to defend yourself. I have a sign on my outside door that says "Fuck the dog, beware the owner," with a nice pic of a pistol on it. I do a little prepping, as much as I can in my tiny apartment, and I know how to grow my own food. Grew up camping and know how to sterilize water and even make an emergency water distiller if I need to. The one thing I never wanted to learn was how to skin and prepare a kill. I'm thinking that wouldn't be too hard to learn. I do know how to fish, shrimp, crab and clean all the above if I could get close to water. I've studied wild edible food for a few years now, so I could probably survive in the wilderness if I could find water. 

Do I want to have to use any of those skills? Hell no! But I grew up in the South with survivalists and even some hard-core militia members, so I can if I have to, and they know we differ politically, but they would take me in (as long as I keep my mouth shut). Hell, a militia member taught me to shoot a rifle. He was my cousin, but nevertheless, family is more important than politics in the South when TSHTF. You see this during all the major catastrophes such as Katrina. Anybody with a boat was out there in the 9th ward rescuing black people. They didn't care that they were black or poor. They were Americans, and they needed help. 

What most people don't understand about the South is that being a fellow Southerner is more important than being red or blue when hard times hit. My accent alone would get me help in any Southern state. Nobody asks your political affiliation in those circumstances. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I believe that, I truly do. After all, you have to serve and survive a long time to get to be a general. I'd almost like to see a military coup at this point, where they would take over the government long enough to get rid of these jokers (including congress) and start all over. My fear would be that once they took control, they wouldn't want to do the right thing by cleaning house and giving it back. Sometimes, I think that is the only way to fix it, though. Just get rid of the parties and have popular vote elections and let the citizens take back their states and country. Not saying much would change, especially in the red states, but at least it would be what the people vote for, not what they are gerrymandered into having. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You have no idea what it was like when quotas were in place. You could be turned down for government housing if they hadn't met their minority quotas. Bussing started because of quotas. Businesses could get sued by the government if they didn't meet minority quotas. At one point in the 80's, historically black colleges were forced to admit more whites or have federal funding cut. They were literally giving away full ride 4-year scholarships to any white person who wanted to attend. I'm not sure what that situation is now, but I was flat out told by the manager of a government apt. complex I lived in during college in the early 80s that she already had her quota of blacks, which is why I got in ahead of others in line. I'm not making this shit up. I'm not a millenial. I lived through this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, I'll fight for legal immigrants all day long. People who come over here just to have kids and think that will give them the right to stay -- not so much. People who come over on special visas so big business can get cheaper labor -- not at all. People who come over on educational visas and take financial aid away from natural or naturalized citizens -- nuh-uh, never. Families who come over on visitor visas and never leave while working under the table for low wages -- not those either.

Legal immigrants -- sure, come on in, make yourself at home, but don't start dealing drugs and working under the table for lower wages to cheat our citizens out of jobs. Not all of them do, mind you, but if even ONE does, they and their employers should be punished. Obey our laws, or get the fuck out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I guess the solution would actually be to cut off all financial aid to non-citizens. I've never understood why we give it to them anyway. I understand giving WIC and food stamps to children, because they are helpless, but there should be no aid given to anyone who is not either a natural or naturalized citizen over the age of 18, and then only if they are still in high school. 

I know that makes me sound like a Republican, but I'm really sort of fiscally conservative, and do believe in taking care of our own first. I just don't go as batshit crazy about it as the Trumpites do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And what is wrong with giving our own citizens a larger piece of the educational pie? That's a huge part of the H1B argument, that we don't have enough educated and skilled people here. I agree with giving American citizens preference in college admissions. Don't they have any decent colleges overseas these people can go to? I'm honestly with Trump on this one. Give those slots to OUR best and brightest. My son lost out on a full-ride scholarship to college because it was given to an Asian girl. They even told him that they had to give it to her because of minority quotas. He got another one, but he had to reapply every year. Luckily, he's pretty smart, so he got it renewed every year and got through college. You know what that Asian girl did with HER education? Went into an arranged marriage and moved back to her country, so the U.S. got no benefit from that. 

We have too many kids who cannot go to college now, or end up in debt for the rest of their lives. They deserve priority in admissions at least. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I lived in a town that was literally overrun by eastern Europeans, most of them illegal. They'd get one person into the country, then bring over the entire family on visitor visas. They would go to work under the table as housekeepers, yard men, and the wealthier of them ran drugs and gambling rings. There is one large neighborhood they call "Little Ukraine" and the part of town with the most drugs was called "Little Russia." They took over whole neighborhoods, and ran them into the ground. That's just one place. Russian gangs and the Russian mafia are known to be the most vicious and brutal of all. </TEXT>

And you think the Irish love the British? No fucking way.

<TEXT> Remember that this country was largely settled by the British who have always hated the Irish to some extent or another, for some odd reason. They didn't want the Micks coming in ruining the good thing they had going. I think it's because the British have no sense of humor and the Irish are fun-loving. You didn't see England stepping in to save the starving Irish during the potato famine, did you? No. They would have let them all starve and laughed about it. ETA: Admittedly, I'm not studied in the politics of that era, or any really.

Our British allies are not so innocent of racism either. What do you think Brexit is about? It started as a protest against the huge influx of Indians (since India used to be a British colony), now it's any other European that isn't English who has crossed borders during the EU days to take their jobs. Hell, they even hate the Welsh and the Cornish. 

Point being, they brought all that prejudice over here with them, and passed it down to future generations. 

The world is full of hatred, but mostly full of fear. We fear what we don't know. Even I, one of the least racist people you will ever know, feel uncomfortable when I'm around people speaking another language, but that's my problem. Doesn't mean I hate them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe you're too young to remember, but back when the lottery was first instituted, it was found that the government was running a scam by saying that the proceeds went to "supplement" education funds, when in fact, instead of supplementing those funds, they were taking away education money from General funds and supplanting it with lottery money. Where was that money going? To pay for legislators' earmarked special projects. It was a national scandal, and the reason my home state of SC did not get the lottery passed the first time. Nobody trusted those crooks in the SC legislature not to do the same thing to them, which they did when it finally did get passed.

Remember that although we don't have personal income tax, our gas tax is around $.55 per gallon (one of the top 10 in the nation), so they are getting their money somehow. There are more people with DLs than there are who own cars, so I'm thinking the increased renewal fee is making up for a bit of the registration decrease. 

I guess the whole state isn't a scam, but overall, it's a pretty scammy state. I love the weather, though, so I'll just pay that sunshine tax and keep on truckin'.  </TEXT>

My lease here says 3 days, but they give permission for visiting relatives to stay longer, but not forever. My son came and stayed for a week, no problem. On the other hand, someone here got permission for 4 related adults, a child an 3 dogs to live in a 2BR apartment, but I think it was supposed to be temporary until one of the adults could find a job.

<TEXT> SERIOUSLY? Any group of people who control both the financial industry and the media industry have the President under their thumbs. They can collapse the economy at any time they want. 

Trump was on Palestine's side until the Israelis took him aside and made it clear whose side he would be on. Does no one remember that? 

When Iraq invaded Kuwait, we bombed the shit out of them, but Israel is CONTINUALLY invading Palestine, and the world does nothing. WHY? Because "he who controls the money, controls the world," that's why.

Israel is one of the most criminal states in the entire world, yet they have us by the purse strings, so we don't care at all. No wonder the entire middle east hates them so much. It's not anti-semitism. It's because they are bullies who have the U.S. by the balls. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My younger son was born in 1985, and he was raised largely without internet and certainly without cell phones. He was raised on OTA t.v., Blockbuster and going to the library. He honestly wasn't even interested in my computer (I'd had one since he was two). He didn't go right to college, choosing to "find" himself first, which took awhile. He took I think 6 years to get his degree, having to drop out a few times to earn money. He chose to be a tech engineer because he could make the most money doing that, but ended up loving it. He isn't on IG or snapchat, but he is glad I now have a smartphone and can text him. He doesn't hang out a lot on FB, isn't on Twitter and prefers to go to LinkedIn to make business and social connections. 

I guess you could say he's sort of a Millenial/Gen-X hybrid, since he grew up in the 90s. People who came of age in the 90s are just different, that's all there is to it. They are nothing like the young millenials. </TEXT>

There are thousands of undocumented Caribbeans, especially Jamaicans, living in S. Florida. I've been trying to get INS to kick one of them out for years, to no avail. They've had him up on tax evasion several times for not paying his business taxes, and he's running a chop shop out of another town. The local LE says they don't have the resources to chase down every single one of these people. I can understand that, so I don't know what Trump thinks he's going to do about it. 

There are supposedly about 10,000+ Canadians living and working here on expired work visas too, and God only knows how many Europeans. People with white skin can get away with it much easier than brown and black people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I lived in a town in SW FL where there was a large community of Ukranians. One would get a work visa and the others would come over and work under the table as housekeepers, yard crews, whatever they could get that paid cash. Some set up illegal roadside produce stands, and some just sold drugs. It happens all over the country. People who want money are not going to let a few little laws stop them. 

They also would give custody of one or more of their children to a legal relative, so they could get benefits for them. If you think the Indians are not doing the same, you are naive. I'm not saying all of them, but I know of a few who are working under the table at convenience store/gas stations and hotels owned by relatives.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  For example those Indian workers you're disparaging above look for opportunities abroad because there aren't enough back home and because India has no welfare system for the jobless.

Yes, but only the higher-class of Indians is allowed to go to college, so they are the first in line for good jobs there. Their social system is much different than ours, and even though they say there is no more caste system, there is an "unofficial" one. The poorest people in India do not get to go to college, or even to school sometimes. Only those who can afford it get to go, so those techies are not poor kids we need to help.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You have a long way to go to get to $4,000 a month. Most of the better mills are not accepting applications right now. Yes, there are people making good money on Textbroker, but most of them have specialized degrees or have been there for years and have many private clients they write for. I've been there 5 years, and have never had a private client. I don't work there much, because I have better options now, but it's not a place to get rich quick, by any means. 

Do you know how to write in AP style? If not, learn it quickly, because all the mills use it, and some are very strict about it. Textbroker has a comma fetish, and they will demote you over comma issues.

In short, freelance writing is not a "I don't want to work a regular job, so I'm going to freelance" income. Most people started out part-time and worked thier way up before they could quit their jobs. Not trying to be mean, just telling you the absolute God's honest truth. I see so many people in here who have bought the hype that freelance writing is a gold mine, but unless you have some sort of specialized degree like law or tech or finance, or you have experience writing in those verticals, you aren't going to make a full-tme salary up front without working 60 hour weeks.

<TEXT> I know a man who owns a smal motel. He says he hires illegals as maids and kitchen help because they work harder for the money. He pays them minimum wage, no benefits, and he gets twice as much work out of them than the Americans he's hired. He says he gets more complaints about American workers and also they are constantly complaining about low pay and are not appreciative of having a job in a town where unemployment hovers around 7%. He said they usually last about 3 months, then they quit and go back on welfare.  He has latino workers who have been there for years and are very much appreciative to have a job. 

Americans are spoiled. Mexico has no social welfare system. You work or you starve, so they are appreciative of any work they can get. Many lower class Americans have figured out how to play the system and make more on welfare than by working minimum wage. Honestly, I lived in a low-income neighborhood for a year during hard times, and I was told every day how to play the system, get onto disability, get free this and that. It's insane! They know every charity organization or goverment program by heart. One woman there had a 3/2 house free, was on disability so she had Medicaid for her and her kids, food stamps, got free clothes from charities and once a month, went to the food bank and got more free food. She got a free cell phone, free bus tickets, and all sorts of other free stuff. We sat down one day and figured out with all she was getting, she was making the equivalent of $40,000 a year when you added in their cash value + the FICA and income tax she would have to pay.

Now tell me why someone would want to work for minimum wage again? Minimum wage wouldn't pay her day care so she could work, and BTW, she was white as the driven snow, not a person of color, so please make no assumptions.  </TEXT>

Out of 10s of thousands who applied, most never showed up or quit after a few days because the work was too hard. I believe only about 100 out of almost 50,000 actually stayed.

<TEXT> Think about this. Why would companies be so adamant about bringing in workers from other countries if it was costing them the same as American workers? They say there are not enough qualified workers here, but that's just not true. When this whole thing started, thousands of Americans were getting laid off from tech jobs and being replaced by Indian workers at lower wages. All the tech companies are complicit in this scheme. Bill Gates once threatened to relocate MS to Canada if he didn't get more than the limited number of H1B visas, and we all know how crooked he is. 

So it would cost  him less to move an entire HUGE fucking company to Canada than it would be to hire Americans? Are you fucking serious? 

And it's not even the visas themselves that are causing people to lose jobs. Once they are here, they bring over their families on special family visas, and those people take jobs for lower wages too. It's a racket that is costing everyone jobs. 

Most tech grads now end up in startups, because the big companies won't hire them. Very few recent tech grads are hired by the big tech companies. I know people who work at MS and Google, and they say that many of the H1B hires are low-level techies who make 75% of what American workers would be paid. Plus, they are often hired as temps, saving the companies even more money.

Add to that that only the higher echelons of Indian society have access to that kind of education, so we are promoting their caste system (which they say no longer exists, but it does). 



I'm personally glad he is doing this. </TEXT>

I used to protest in the 60s, and I always expected someone to get hurt or arrested. Luckily, it wasn't ever me, because I learned really quickly not to touch a cop, and to sit down with my hands behind my head when people were getting tossed into the paddy wagons.  Then Kent State happened. I'm not sure this administration will not cause another Kent State, maybe even at Berkeley if they keep up the protests there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Have you ever moved into another county that was  mostly red? 

These were my problems when I did that:

I moved counties temporarily, and my old county did not send me my requested absentee ballot. Voter registration peeps in new county said I could not register there unless my DL had my new county address on it. This was done to me TWICE, and I found out that the state voter ID law does not say this. Had to get the Obama campaign to call Super of elections to straighten this out, and was able to change registration over the phone.

Got back to my old county and was told by a worker at SOE office that I had to have a birth certificate, SS card and proof of residence to change the address on my DL before I could re-register to vote in this county, even though they could see I had been registered here before. That was all lies. Same old "Your DL address has to match your local address." At the time, I was not permanently settled, so didn't want to have to go down to the DMV and pay the $25 to change my address. Found out THIS was all lies too by calling the Dem Party headquarters here, and having them call the Super of Elections who called me personally and changed my registration to this county over the phone.

I have been registered to vote in FL since 1987. I could not believe the BS I had to go through to vote.

<TEXT> When I was young and only knew how to do one thing, my father said "One-trick ponies get put out to pasture." That is exactly what has happened to a lot of these people. They only knew how to do one thing; i.e., work in a factory or a coal mine or something like that. When those jobs were gone, they did not know how to start over with something new. For some, it was lack of education, for some it was age discrimination in hiring (I've experienced that myself), and for some it was lacking the economic means to move to an area that had jobs or to obtain training for a new occupation. 

I was raised in a state that had a lot of textile mills, and you don't know how many times I heard from people who had been laid off when automation took their jobs "I don't know how to do nothing else. What am I gonna do?" I've sat down with a lot of people and pointed out to them that they DID know how to do othet things, and tried to get them to turn that into an occupation, but they just weren't capable of running their own business. Some did. I have a friend in my home state who now sells organic herbs, seeds, and plants from her little 2-acre plot and does better than she did in the mills, and one who sells quilted and hand-sewn items at craft fairs and on etsy. Most of them, though, just went on welfare and watched their lives slide downhill.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My town has probably the worst postal service in the state of FL. They will do things to spite you if you complain to management. Once I lived where they had cluster mailboxes, and the mailperson put a package into the wrong box. The person whose box they put it in just happened to be there when they delivered the mail that day, and said "You put this into the wrong box. This is her box right here (pointed to it)" Did the mail person put it into my box? No, she threw it into the back of the truck. No shit. All to the loud complaints of my neighbor asking why the fuck she did that. So neighbor tells me, I call the PO, can't get an answer, so I make a complaint to the main complaint service online. Tracking showed that the package was delivered, then it suddenly changed. By the time I got the package 2 weeks later, it had been to CA, back through MI, and then back to FL. I've heard this is a common tactic they use when someone complains about them. They just send your package around the fucking country to teach you a lesson. Unfortunately for them, my package was medication (which I put into my complaint), so they ended up having to answer for that, plus pay for me having to go out of pocket to get more meds. 

I've had them cram a package so tightly into my box (because they were to fucking lazy to walk to the door and deliver it properly) that I could not get it out, and had to sit and wait for them the next day to get them to remove it from their side.  I've also sat and watched out the window as they tossed a package marked "fragile" across my 6-ft high gate into my courtyard, when the gate was unlocked and the front door was 10 feet away. One of them left a pink registered mail notice stuck into my gate, and then it rained, and luckily, I found it on the ground in the morning, but the ink was all smeared, so I had to take it to the PO to find out WTF it was.

Glad you like the PO. Obviously, you live in some place where they are decent. I don't. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I call tech support, I always say "I've turned it on and back off, I've done this and this, etc., etc." so they can just skip that shit. I get really aggravated with Mozilla support because all they can ever say is "Does it work in safe mode?" when I've already said that I checked that. then they still say "Start it in safe mode and check your add-ons." To them, it's always a fucking add-on, no matter what. Half the time they're wrong, and the program is just fucked up.

I've learned so much about FF just because their support forum personnel have no clue and I have to go in and find it myself. Every time I used to post, there would be at least half a dozen people who would say "I have that same problem!," but to Mozilla, it was always our fault. 

Then there is Microsoft, who always tells you to refresh Windows. WTF? I want to say "Have you ever personally refreshed Windows? Do you realize that it's an all-day process and that things may be worse after you do it?" 

Bad tech support is way worse than bad users, I think. </TEXT>

SE is the next area they will try to gentrify. They are already doing it, and then they will just push the black community out further and further. 

ETA: Waldo would be more of a business community, because of the access to the airport and also railways, I think. Businesses would build up all around the airport and then they would turn 301 into an I-10 spur. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Oh -- but the STUDENTS!"

More like their rich parents. Do you know why the paved over all the unpaved areas in the Plaza downtown? Because there was no ordinance against the homeless sleeping on the unpaved areas, only on the pavement. Rich UF booster parents were "appalled" at their kids having to see that (while they are stumbling around drunk at night downtown, probably) and so they paved the whole frigging thing. No shit. 

I once had a parent say to me on FB that she thought the entire SE side of town should be razed and rebuilt, because she hated to even drive her kid through it to get to school. Her main complaint was that Walgreens had a sign advertising free HIV tests. I guess her baby never had unprotected sex, right?

I taught myself HTML and built a complete website when that was the way they were built. I'm minimally literate in CSS (although I hate it) and am trying to learn more about XML and other design languages. I'm really into how the internet works now, although learning that is harder than coding, I find. I remember when I asked somebody to explain "the cloud" to me, but now I understand it at least rudimentarily. 

And I'm 64 frigging years old! I know 1000x what some of these idiots passing this legislation they know nothing about know. Of course, I've always been a knowledge junkie who, before the WWW, read hundreds of books a year, mostly non-fiction. </TEXT>

I see this town being totally taken over by UF one day, and a lot of flight to places like Hawthorne, which will become a bedroom community of Gainesville, complete with overpriced homes and gentrified neighborhoods. But they'll probably move out toward Waldo first, because of the access to the airport.

I'm just sad, because I really don't want to ever move again. I don't think my neighborhood is in any danger of being changed much, though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I live off of 34th about a mile from Butler Plaza (1.5 mi from WalMart), and don't have a car, so I do agree about having everything in one place. I moved out here about 2 years ago expressly because I could walk to do my shopping, plus on hot or rainy days, there are tons of buses going anywhere you want to go. I just hate that these high-rises are ruining the small-town feel of Gainesville, and most of them are high-end residences, so it also changes the entire culture of the area. Plus, it puts twice as many cars on the road, so there's that. Right now, Windmeadows Blvd. doesn't really need street lights, but it will once that hotel and high rise go in.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Coral snakes are notoriously non-aggressive. You practically have to stick your finger in their mouth to get bitten. Most people run into them while gardening, and they usually try to get away. I had one in my yard in SW FL, and I just watched out for it. The black racer that used to like to scare the shit out of me and almost give me heart attacks while I was working in the yard was much bigger danger. 

Remember that most snakes do not want to bite you, and they will backtrack and leave if they can. Venemous snakes want to save their venom for something they can eat. 

I agree to teach your child to recognize the snakes and stay away from them. My grandmother lived on a largely undeveloped island, and there were snakes everywhere. She taught us to take a "snake stick" with us to thrash the underbrush to scare them off, and the only snake I ever saw was a green snake and a black racer. My sister, on the other hand, forgot the rules and got bit by a copperhead later in life.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I give away all baby and child things on Craigslist. I try to make sure they don't go to resellers, but I might have missed one or two. My problem is that I have no car, and the places you are talking about don't pick up, but I do let them know what I have so they can send people after it. I admit, I sell some stuff, because I need money too, but I have a very small apartment (500sf) so I can't stash a lot of stuff. 

Those are three good questions, especially the last one. I've been looking at things with a very critical eye lately, and asking "Do I need this?" It doesn't have to be a physical need. Sometimes I may need it because it makes me happy. If I can't say I "need" it, it goes into a box to be done away with in some way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are so many factors. Some topics pay better than others, your experience counts (don't expect to start at 20cpw unless you have a degree in journalism and a couple of years of experience). I make most of my money right now writing product descriptions because online articles are not as hot as e-commerce. You have to be fast to make decent money at it. I've been doing it awhile, so I can make about $20 an hour if there is plenty of work and I can get on a roll, but some days I've only made $10, and that's not for 8 hours straight. It doesn't work that way. 

Freelance writing is feast or famine, and you have to be very flexible in what you are willing to write. If you're looking for something stable, this isn't it, although there are some people who have turned it into a decent living. 

There is no way to project what you can make down the road, because the market changes every day. I'm not writing now what I wrote when I started, nor am I earning what I used to earn. Remember also, that you will be self-employed, so you have to pay your own taxes. I don't know about Canada, but in the U.S., we save back about 30% of each payout for taxes. 

Why don't you get started somewhere like one of the content mills and see how you like it? Textbroker has a site for the UK (textbroker.co.uk) and it's as good a place to start as any. They don't pay the best, but you can learn what clients want there, and work your way up to better pay and direct orders. If you hate it, you can go on to something else. </TEXT>

My problem isn't that I don't need the stuff. Mostly, it's that I end up letting it sit forever until I do something with it, but not this time. I'm going to jump right in and get this done! This bookshelf will be so great, because I have the tops of my desks covered with baskets full of stuff, so now I can put those baskets on the bookshelf and have a nice, clean desktop where I can work. Got both the desk and the chair from the dumpster last year, and haven't gotten to use it yet. 

So there is a plan, but I have so little space here, I have to be careful how much I bring in. ETA: Now if someone would just toss out a decent dresser, I'd be happy, so I can get rid of this old ratty one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know at least 3 people who are doing very well writing novels for Amazon and none of them have a college degree. If you want it, you can have it, you just have to want it badly enough to learn how to get it. 

Forget the "great American novel." Erotic romance is where the money is. Lonely women, sitting at home bored, wishing they had a Prince Charming to rescue them are the ones you need to write for. 

I don't know if you're old enough to remember those little Harlequiin romance novels, but my mom had about 100 of them, and she traded them with her friends for new ones. She belonged to a Harlequin romance book club with about 30 members, and all of them had dozens of those little books. Now they buy them for $2.99 on Amazon. 

While you're raking in money from those to support yourself, you can write any kind of great American novel you want. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually, some of the stuff I got will help me declutter, like the nice bookshelves and tables. I now have somewhere to put things I take out of the boxes. Honestly, I figure I can unload about 10-12 boxes onto this huge bookshelf, which motivates me to unpack them and get rid of more stuff. 

The outdoor tables will help get my plants up off the ground so I can sort and photograph them to sell. 

But I really didn't need that microwave! Here I am thinking of getting rid of the one I have, and now I have TWO! This one is a bit nicer, a bit smaller and works perfectly, so I guess I'll keep it for now and get rid of the other one. It's not worth selling because the ring under the glass is broken, but if I toss it up on Craigslist for free, maybe someone will take it.

I also got one of those tension-bar bath organizers, which I really, really need. That will get things off the sink counter and the top of the toilet tank. 

Now, if I could just find a place to put them until I can get them where they need to be.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm with you! I've had a horrendous few years where most of what I own has been packed in unopened boxes for 5 years. No way am I just tossing that stuff out! 

I actually had someone say "Why go through it all? Just load up the boxes and take them to Goodwill since you don't even know what's in them?" Really??? The fact that I don't know what's in them is EXACTLY why I have to go through them. 

I had pared down to things I didn't think I could or didn't want to live without, so everything in those boxes is something in those categories. 

I have been in this apartment almost two years now. The first year, I was so scared I was going to have to move again, I wouldn't unpack anything but what I really needed. I even kept all my boxes, flattened out, just in case. For most of the next year, I was helping my son financially during his last year of college, and couldn't afford to furnish the place like I wanted, so I just put it off. Now that all that is out of the way, I get to go through my treasures and decide what I really want to keep and what I can let go of. 

Don't feel bad at all! Other people don't know you and don't know your life or your heart. Do what gives you JOY! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Many years ago (20 at least), a friend gave me a set of round-bottom copper bowls, which I promptly used as decoration on my kitchen wall, since I never whip egg whites and they are annoying since the bottom isn't flat. Since I really don't have room for decorative items in my kitchen anymore, I was thinking I probably don't need them. So I thought I'd sell them, and lo and behold! They are selling for anywhere from $30 to over $100 on eBay! I never noticed the brand name, but even the cheap-looking ones are going for a premium. Unbelievable. I'll have to polish these up a bit and see what I can get for them.

Some of the stuff I have had packed away for a long time is now "vintage," and will probably fetch a decent price on Craigslist (I don't do eBay). We'll see.

<TEXT> This is a serious statement. I truly feel pity for anyone who would support this corrupt, hateful, nasty man to run our country. You obviously have no moral compass. It makes me extremely sad that 47% of our country fits into this category. Clearly, we have gone wrong somewhere to have spawned such minds. I'm done with you now. I'll pray for you, because I actually do live by what the bible says. I pity your family too for having to live with someone like you, and am afraid for your children being raised to be someone like you. You truly are the worst example of what America is about, and the rest of the world agrees. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been seeing this a lot with people who use VPNs, especially on sites that don't allow foreign workers. You have to prove that you live in the U.S. somehow, not that you pay taxes in the U.S. Lots of expats pay U.S. taxes, but they live all over the world. I have two other friends who are living in Mexico who are having the same problems. Luckily, they have someone in the states who will say they are living there, but if they didn't, they would be screwed.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I see so many people on here asking for quick money that they need in a very few days. You'd have better luck selling your possessions. 

Setting up accounts takes time, and if you are under 18 and don't have a PayPal account, you're pretty much screwed. MTurk pays into Amazon Payments, which you need to transfer to either a prepaid debit card or a bank account. 

The problem with places like UpWork is that it takes longer than a few days sometimes just to get a reply from some jobs, and even longer than that to get the jobs approved and paid.

So if you have any inkling that you may need money in the future very quickly, set things up now. Otherwise, start going through everything you own and sell it on Craigslist. 

I speak from experience. I've been working online for 8 years, mostly writing, and I only have two places where I could work and make any amount of money paid overnight or in a few days, and that would be limited by how much competition there is for that work and how much work there is available. One of those is MTurk and one is not accepting applications, so no need to write and ask me what they are. </TEXT>

As far as I remember (the 1980's is a long time ago), none of this was ever really proven to be the work of the CIA alone, although they may have helped. They did start the whole crack epidemic and all, so there's that. Still, not all democracies are good democracies, and not all democratic leaders are good leaders. Case in point - Trump.

They cut the exact same lawn (3/4 of which was already cut) and charge 3x the going rate for the service. Plus the city wanted to charge her $250 administration fee. This kind man stood up and slammed $250 on the council's podium and told them they were horrible people to do that to a single mom. Turned out that there was a reporter there, who decided to look into things and found out the contractor was the BIL of someone in city government, and this wasn't the first time he had done this. When it was all said and done, there was a huge scandal, the guy lost his contract, and there was a city ordinance passed that contractors could not charge more than "the prevailing rate" for any service. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, all that, but they also bust huge drug cartels and find and bring to justice international criminals. I bet they do a lot more of that than they do what you're talking about. There are many different arms of the CIA. Your scenario is only one. If we put them out of business, we would soon be overrun with international criminals and drug cartels taking over our country right out in plain sight. The CIA gets to them before the FBI needs to, in other words, it keeps them where they belong -- away from the U.S. No, they're not perfect, but I'm willing to bet that they have done a lot more good for this country than harm to it.

<TEXT> My son's room used to get so messy, and he would get so upset when I told him to clean it because he got overwhelmed. I told him to take one thing at a time and put it where it belonged, then repeat until it was done. That's the only way to get through a mountain of stuff. One thing at a time. 

I have lupus, and my house gets messy sometimes, especially the kitchen, and especially now that I have such a small amount of counter space. I've been known to take everything off the tabletops and counters and put it into a pile on the floor in a place where I can't ignore it, then clean the table/countertops well. Just seeing those surfaces clean motivates me to go through the pile on the floor. It also gives me space to work.

I had a sister like that, only no matter how clean your house was, she could find something to bitch at you about. She chewed out my 80 yo mother once because there were fingerprints on her doorframes. I don't talk to her anymore, but I often wonder what her house looks like now that she is 74 years old and not able to get around well, and I wonder if she feels bad for how she treated her own freaking mother. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Better in some ways, worse in others. Search engines grade you not only on how long people stay on a page, but overall on how long they stay on the site, how many links they click and how many pages they visit. I'd say never put over 1200 words on one page without breaking it up in some way, although some say no more than 800 and some say up to 1500. 

ETA There is something called a "bounce rate" that measures visitors who click in and quickly back out. If you have a long article, some visitors will click quickly back out because they don't want to read it all. I've done that too.

You may have to experiment, based on your topic. You are also graded on return visitors, so in my example, someone may leave after reading about varieties of blueberries, then when they get one, will come back to read about how to plant and grow them, then if they get pests will remember the site and come back to learn about how to control pests. This doesn't work for every topic, but it's a pretty standard way to get a higher ranking. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Someone once told me to always go for higher priced items on Amazon and impulse items on Clickbank. I haven't done anything on Clickbank because they annoyed me with all their spam. 

The way I work Amazon is to write a product review and link to the Amazon product in a line that says "This is the best price I could find online for this product." People love bargains, and they by-and-large don't like to do a lot of comparison shopping. I also relate other items to the item I'm reviewing, like with diatomaceous earth for internal use, I will point out that while DE removes dangerous heavy metals, it also removes essential minerals that are metals, such as iron, zinc and copper, so I link to those supplements. To get them to buy a larger size, I point out that it is also useful in the home or garden to kill insect pests. 

Yes, Amazon commissions are painfully low, and there are rumors they are discontinuing their affiliate program soon, but if you "stack" products like I do, and link to the higher-priced items, you'll make more sales. You need to tell people WHY they should buy an item, not just throw up a link.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Professional blogger/writer here. Most people only have the attention span to read about 600 words at a time, so put your most important material in the first 600 words if you're wanting to give information. By breaking up long articles in to pages, or even serial blog posts (part 1, part 2, or even different related topics) the mind does a "reset" every time it reaches another page, and starts again on the 600 word limit. Still, after a number of pages, the mind may have all the information it needs, and just not read the rest. This is why it's important to "front load" the most important info into the first part of an article. 

For example, I once wrote a series of articles on blueberries. I could have put it all into one large article, but instead, I broke it down into four 600-word articles on choosing a type and variety, how to plant, how to care for them and pests and diseases. I did this because some people are only looking for one of those topics and don't want to scroll through a 3,000 word articles to find the info. If they can't find what they want quickly, they'll click out and go elsewhere.

On a blog, how long a person stays on the site is just as important as the fact that they click on your search link. You don't want drive-bys, so you give things to them in bites with internal links leading to other bites.

As a professional writer, I think conciseness is the most important thing to learn. Say as much as you can in as few words as possible. I start out free writing, just letting thoughts flow, then I go back and tighten up the copy at least twice, also reading for spelling and grammar. Breaking long articles up into smaller, concise bites will help keep people on your blog longer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As someone who has been in this situation, she isn't overpaying. She probably gets back everything she pays in (aside from SS, of course), plus Earned Income Credit plus standard deductions for herself and the kids. I had a couple of years where I got back more than I paid in, but not by too much. It also may be her way of saving, by not claiming her kids than getting it back at the end of the year. I did that too, because money  in a savings account was too tempting to spend. Believe it or not, a lot of low-income people do this. It's stupid in a way, because no interest on your savings, but at the low rates they are paying for savings accounts nowadays, it's not that much of a loss, and you can't spend it on frivolous things.  </TEXT>

I do feel like freelance editors fleece clients sometimes. That being said, I've had editors make a piece factually incorrect and requested that my byline be removed because I refused to have my name on such garbage. That usually got their attention. Only once did I have a person refuse to correct the piece or remove the byline, so I did a total rewrite of the piece on my own blog, corrected the errors, and noted that it had been made factually incorrect by an editor and the client refused to remove my name, so I wanted to correct the errors. Then I sent them a link to my blog post, and within hours, they had removed my byline with the understanding that I would remove my post.

You have to be a badass sometimes in this business. I do not let clients abuse me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I seem to sometimes get the most nitpicky editors, and TBH, some of the things they say about my writing deficiencies are upper-level English (I'd say Master's Degree or better) that are way beyond what is expected for most online projects. 

I once had a HS algebra teacher who taught us from the HS book and gave us test problems from his first-year college algebra book. He didn't seem to see the difference in complexity, but there was enough so that half of the class was failing, and the curve was outrageous. No one got an A and only one boy got a B. I failed or just passed every test, and finally just stopped doing them at all, just put my name on them and turned them in. I made a C for the course. That's how big the curve was.

Anyway, what I'm saying is that I feel like I'm being given 8th grade work and graded on a graduate level. Wondering if anyone else has noticed this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They appeal to writers at the lower end of the scale who want security of payment. Mills are easy. You don't have a be a quality writer and you always get paid. My problem is when quality writers set themselves up on mills and work for well under 10cpw, and consider that good money. 

I use mills to fill in when there is no other work, but to me, that's what they are there for. Even a little money is better than no money at all. </TEXT>

I used to live in a state that grew a lot of fryers, and the chickens are so front-heavy, they can't fly or sometimes even stand. The bigger the breasts, the more they sell for, since it's the most popular meat on the bird. I prefer legs myself, but even those are completely oversized. I usually put 4 legs in a qt. size ziploc to freeze them, but sometimes I can only get 3 in there. </TEXT>

They refused to budge. I talked to a lwyer, and he threatened to sue them because when spinal fluid was leaking out of my spine due to their botched spinal block, and I had horrible spinal headaches, they tried to give me codeine, which I'm allergic to (big red letters across the top of my chart) and also refused to tell me about a 5-minute procedure called a blood patch that stopped the pain immediately.

<TEXT> Save that article and sell it elsewhere, but FIRST run it through copyscape for a week to make sure he hasn't published it. That is a common scam on some sites to post a long article with great pay, then reject it and publish anyway, in effect stealing your work. If it's been stolen, go the DMCA route first. If that doesn't work, find out who his hosting provider is and turn him in for plagiarism. If he has ads on his page, go to them and tell them he is a plagiarist and ask them to remove their ads from that site. If he has Adsense, Google has a form you can fill out.

<TEXT> I'm so sick of people acting like freelance writing is some hobby that people do for the fun of it. I've turned down three jobs in the last month because they refused to sign a contract. I try to explain that I'm a business person, that this is my business, but for some reason, the word "freelance" makes them not take me seriously. I actually had one say "Oh, I thought you were freelance." I wanted to say "Do you have a dictionary?" I guess I'm just supposed to trust them to pay me when they say they will, right? Wrong.

I've also been trying to hire someone to write some blog articles for me. I asked for a resume. One said "I don't want to send a resume, I work under a pseudonym." WHAT??? I blame this on the PayPal rule that if you don't make $20,000 a year or have 200 transactions, you don't get a 1099. Evidently, everyone just wants to work under the table and not pay taxes. Do they not realize that the IRS can find out that you're doing this? Heard about someone last year who got audited by the IRS and they made him give them all his PayPal statements for the year. Found out he had only reported half his freelance income, and now he's in deep doo-doo. 

One said "What do you need a resume for?" I just didn't even answer. 

I work so hard for my money, and I run my business like any other sole proprietorship, which means I need a contract and I need resumes and I need you to act like you would if you were applying at a brick-and-mortar business. You surely wouldn't walk into a store and say "I need you to hire me, but I don't want to fill out an application or even give you my name and I want to work only under the table." 

I know Reddit has a lot of really young people on it, but this is ridiculous! If you want a job, act like a grown up living in a grown-up world.

<TEXT> Been there, done that. Bubblews, Mahalo, Examiner, Bright Hub...need I go on? Anyone who has been doing this for any length of time knows this business model never lasts. After the Angel Investor money runs out, they either cut pay drastically, stop paying you altogether, or just shut down and don't pay you. Or they do like Examiner did and lock you out in the middle of the night, change the rules that said the work belonged to you, and steal all your work and your original photos. 

Look, if you have a ton of social media friends, and you can get them to give you clicks, fine. Ride the horse until it drops, but remember -- it WILL drop, so have another horse ready to ride off on. In other words, don't make this the only egg in your basket. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Been there, done that. Can you say "Bubblews?" Thing was, most of the views came from peers, who didn't click ads, and after the original angel investor money was gone, people stopped getting paid. I've seen this happen over and over again; Examiner, Bright Hub, Mahalo --- should I go on? I've been writing online for 8 years, and this model never works for very long. Never. They always have to drop pay, then they lose their best writers. First, they say you retain copyright to your work, then they change the rules in the middle of the night, lock you out, and steal your work (Mahalo and Examiner both did this).

If you want some fast money while they are still paying, go for it, but don't count on it lasting. Ride that horse until it drops, then get off and have another horse saddled up to take you on ahead. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Writers Domain is not taking applications. Writer Access is hard to break into, and don't know if they are still taking apps. Constant Content is writing on spec, but you can make decent money there with private requests once you get established. I don't know much about Zerys, but I hear it pays well, but doesn't have much work. Crowd Content is somewhat strange, although some people love it. Work there is sporadic unless you're put onto teams, and most teams aren't worth what they pay you.

As for Textbroker, there are people making amazing money there. If you go onto the forums, you will see that teams and direct orders are how to make good money on TB. I used to be on a team that paid .08 a word, and I made a lot of money on it. You can charge whatever you want for direct orders. I use it as a back-up and fill-in site for times when work elsewhere is slow or for days I need $10 more to fill out my quota. It's not a bad place, and $400-500 a month is definitely possible there in time. When I worked it full-time I was pulling in around $500 a week, and I wasn't on any special teams at the time, and I've never had a direct order. It was just choosing easy topics and writing fast.

I'd go with tutoring, though. There are online sites where you can tutor via a skype-like interface and there are also sites like Udemy where you can put up tutorials and have people pay for them.

My favorite newsletter is one for gardening that has recipes, how-tos, and coupons, along with a free something every month, like last month it was a free ebook of all the recipes from last year. You can't just toss out one freebie then spam people to death. The newsletters I sign up for that end up being a spamfest of offers I did not sign up for get unsubscribed and I will never buy from them. I don't believe in spamming people daily because they signed up for a weekly/monthly newsletter. To me, that's just common sense, but a lot of marketers will tell you different.  </TEXT>

I called it a mini blog network, because there was the possibility of always adding more topics. The way I differentiated them was to give them all their own names and themes. At the time, I was doing this on Blogger as bum marketing, and each subdomain was actually a separate blog. 

I don't know if that makes sense, but say the name was Joe's Iowa Homestead and the four other blogs were Joe's DIY, Joe's Garden, Joe's Animals  and Joe's Great Outdoors. Each blog would have a separate client base and separate marketing, yet they all tie back in to the main blog, which has blurbs with links leading to the specific blogs, plus general posts about homesteading in Iowa. So they are all different, but all connected. I guess you could call these "sister blogs," but I tend to think of sister blogs as being on unrelated topics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can you write in AP style? How do you propose to get paid, since most people want to pay by PayPal and you must be 18 to get a PayPal account. I do know teens who have accounts under their parents' names on some content mills and get paid through their PayPal account. Payment is going to be your biggest problem. If you can write, you can find people to buy it. Never accept checks or money orders. Too many scammers out there. 

My advice is to find local businesses that have neglected blogs or that could use a blog and sell your services there. That way, you can get checks, have your parents sign for you to open a checking account, and get paid like that. Or they can pay you cash, which has obvious advantages. </TEXT>

<TEXT> HEAR! HEAR! I agree with you 100%. The dems were as complicit in the destruction of working class jobs as the repubs, and it didn't start with NAFTA. It started long before that, when we were buying tons of Japanese steel and putting thousands of small farmers out of business. This goes way back to the Carter administration, and it was a whisper in the wind even before that. We knew it was happening. We did nothing. Instead, we made trade deals like NAFTA, purportedly to make the electronics and auto industry competitive with Japanese imports, when all we had to do was put limits and tariffs on those imports to make them less appealing. Then the other industries said "What about us? I need to be able to get cheaper labor too!" and we let them move to China. Then tech said "Hey, we need cheaper labor," so we let them bring in workers from Asia and displace American workers. Are you aware that Bill Gates threatened to take his company to Canada if we didn't give him more guest worker visas? Did we say "Would you like me to help you pack your smarmy ass and get the fuck out of the country that made you rich?" NO, we changed the laws so that all companies could bring in more visa workers. 

Dems let their Wall Street buddies get away with literal grand theft in the very, very, illegal and immoral mortgage debacle, because they needed their money. Plus, if they banks fell, their stock portfolios might be harmed, and they would not have that money to draw on for reelection.

But it's not only the politicians, it's all of us who stood by and became complacent, turned out heads and our backs on the poor, and refused to see what was right in our faces. It was too painful to look. We were not at the breaking point yet.

The Tea Party, which we chose to ignore as "ignorant racists" was formed because those people had had their jobs, their livelihoods, and their dignity stolen from the people who were getting rich off of them. We joked about them as they slowly built themselves up by getting into positions on city and county governments, taking over state legislatures and governor's mansions. 

The saddest part is, in all of this, there was an entire generation growing up watching us not give a shit about whether their parents lost their jobs, or they had to move out of the houses they had grown up in and move in to a motel room or live in their cars. Instead, we allowed them to cut more funds for low income housing, putting even more people out into the streets. We didn't care when cuts in food stamps and school lunch and breakfast programs left them hungry and sick and unable to learn. They watched and they grew to hate us all. And we did nothing. We stood by doing nothing while this generation lost parents, family and friends to needless wars, while the military/industrial machine raked in trillions of their parents hard earned money.

These are Trumps's people. I'm one of them, although I didn't vote for him. They are angry and our arrogance and greed is to blame. I have long said that GREED  and GREED ALONE is what killed the middle class, not the GOP, just GREED on both sides, across the spectrum. 

And we sat back and watched it happen, and turned our heads to homeless families on the street, and the most egregiously arrogant and entitled of us passed laws to punish them for being homeless so we didn't have to have our failures staring us in the face every day.

We are just as complicit as the Republicans, because we made empty promises and did nothing. 

I also agree that we have to stop making excuses for Obama. He was a weak president, who did not fight hard enough for us. He could have rallied people to fight congress, but he didn't. He had that power. He could have made a call to arms to get us to where we are now, but he didn't. IMHO, his legacy is one of apathy when the people he was supposed to be leading were suffering.

Remember, we are the compassionate party. Let's make that work for us. The best thing you can do is VOLUNTEER for service organizations and actually go out into the neighborhoods and help people one-on-one.

DO NOT ignore young people! There are a lot of hungry, down and out college students who need help too, struggling to get an education, going to class hungry, living on the streets. We need to start foundations to help them pay for college so they aren't saddled with so much student debt, because you just KNOW the GOP is going to cut funding for student aid and force them to borrow from their banking overlords. 

WE CAN DO THIS! WE ARE MIGHTY! Never forget the words of Maya Angelou, 

I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.

We lost the millenials in the general because they did not feel like we cared about their issues. Trump has proven one thing to us -- and it's something Oprah Winfrey said long ago -- people just want to be ACKNOWLEDGED.

Ivanka seems to be pretty level-headed most of the time, and she isn't as radical as her father is, so maybe her husband can guard against having Trump led in the wrong direction and keep the wolves at bay. 

Unless he is one of the wolves. I have a strange feeling that his kids are going to try to steal his company from him, which probably wouldn't be a bad thing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow! That sounds awesome! Sounds like $35 could get me lots of food. I don't eat a lot, so if I brought tupperware and took two helpings home, I'd have plenty for the day. 

Just got a job offer, but it doesn't start for two weeks, so this will be a lifesaver. I live close to the house, too, about 6 blocks away. 

About the free food, someone just told me to ask if you can help serve for free food. I wouldn't mind serving a couple of days to repay their kindness. I love Indian food, too, so win-win!

Thanks, everyone. People were right. This sub is a lifesaver. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No doubt the Clinton Foundation was a scam, and even I admit that. It was set up to provide high-paying jobs to all the Clintons' friends and family. After Chelsea could not keep a job, they gave her a job there making over $600K a year. I'm glad it's going down, honestly. I hate to see people hurt by such organizations, but watch carefully -- I just saw an article about how Trump raised $450 million for access to him at Mar a Lago's New Year's Eve party. His son was trying to sell access to Ivanka recently, disguising it as charitable, and Trump has already moaned about its unfairness. They have their own foundation which was shut down by the State of NY for not being licensed to collect money, and which he took money out of for personal gain and to pay off politicians.

This will just continue, so are you going to scream "unfair!" when we try to hold him accountable for all of that and call us all "libtards?"  I would say yes, most Trumpites will, because it's only unfair if it goes against what "Daddy Trumpbucks" does. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Really? Like more pathetic than when Bill Clinton whipped both his Republican opponent's asses in 92 and 96 by more than 200 electoral votes? Or maybe more pathetic than when Barack Obama did the same to McCain in 2008, or even when he beat Romney by 126 electoral votes in 2012? 

Remember, Trump only won by 67 electoral votes. You can think that is amazing, but it isn't. It's actually one of the closest elections in history. Bush only won by 5 electoral votes in 2000 when he was "crowned" President by the SCOTUS. He only won by 35 electoral votes in 2004. The only other modern Presidents who have won by lower margins than Trump were Kennedy in 1962, Nixon in 1968, and Carter in 1976.

<TEXT> I predict that Webster's dictionary will add a definition to "unfair" in the next year that reads "Anything or anyone not in complete agreement with Donald Trump, or any legitimate report of his wrongdoing by the press."

Every fucking time he uses that word, I picture a 2-year-old throwing a tantrum screaming "That's not fair!" </TEXT>

<TEXT> I missed this, because I've been trying to avoid all things Trump the past few days. 

So, in effect, he just called over half of the U.S. citizens his enemies and sore losers? Just when you think he can't get any worse, he outdoes himself.

Wait....didn't he say he would be President to all of us? Guess he changed his tiny little mind. Now he wants to be President to Russia, I suppose. Wait until he realizes THEY are his enemies.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of course they will. And then when Russia attacks us because Trump is an idiot who actually trusts Putin, they will blame that on Obama throwing their spies out of the country. I do think we should have pulled everybody out of our embassy before we did that, though, because I'm afraid Russia will now arrest them at the airport and not let them leave. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is so sad, because it only proves that if any of them had actually listened to Bernie, he might be President now. There was another reporter who said he went to W. Virginia and asked all the Obamacare recipients what they would do if Congress repealed the ACA, and they said they didn't believe they would. Obviously, none of them have noticed that they have tried to repeal it how many times since it was enacted, and only Obama's continually vetoing it kept it in place. They honestly think that the Republicans won't do anything to their supporters, just to "liberals," so in their minds, if you're a "liberal," you won't have any benefits, but if you're a conservative, you can keep yours. Ignorance is our biggest problem in this country. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see a lot here and elsewhere about "moving up" and getting better-paying work, but a lot of that comes with a lot more stress. Private clients come with personality conflicts and billing problems, etc. 

There are a lot of us who just want a few hundred extra bucks a month, and we're perfectly fine with writing easy articles for low pay on a site where the expectations are low and there is little stress, such a Textbroker or some other mill. 

Yet we are constantly berated for bringing down the entire industry. I think that's unfair. Different people have different needs, and not everyone has great ambitions or aspirations. Some of us are older and have absolutely not desire to build a new career. 

I'm really sick of being treated like dirt by younger writers who think I'm holding them back. I'm not holding anybody back. There is plenty of well-paying work out there -- go get it -- and leave the rest of us to do what works for our lives.

<TEXT> I don't know if his advisors told him to do this, or what, but Hillary immediately went to talk to the panel members on stage and Trump went to his family. He took a few pictures with people, then he was ushered out. Hillary and Bill remained talking to people and taking pictures for almost 30 minutes after the debate, and had to be made to leave by their security. If you want to know who is in touch with the American people, it's the Clintons, not The Donald.

I'm not crazy about either one of them, but this really struck me. </TEXT>
