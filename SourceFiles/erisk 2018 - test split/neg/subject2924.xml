<TEXT> I don't think it's either of your guys', thanks though. The monster didn't look like bigfoot, and it wasn't scrawny and boney. If I had to think of one monster similar, I'd say the Rancor from Star Wars, but very bright orange and slimy. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Can anyone help me figure out what this movie is called? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-10 05:17:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, one late night when I was a little kid, the TV was on in my living room, where me, my brother, and my Dad crashed for the night. I remember it being a cheesy 70s-80s horror movie and being terrified by it at that age. I want to watch it again so I can laugh at probably how bad it is.

So what I remember from the movie is that it:

A. Is a horror flick from the 70s-80s. 

B. It has this big orange monster. 

C. I remember it being gore-y, I think. 

D. It took place in some sort of camping site. I think the orange monster came in and started to eat people. 

Thanks!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> What other movies could take place within the Alien/Predator/Blade Runner/Ghost in the Shell universe? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-27 02:45:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey so for some time now I've been trying to get a timeline together of a possible shared universe between movies. Now, obviously Alien, Predator, and Blade Runner are set in the same mythos, but when I watched the 1996 version of Ghost in the Shell, I realized that it could totally take place within the same universe as Blade Runner, being that Major is a replicant, and then therefore it would be tied to the other films as well.

I want this timeline to grow and have so many other movies in it, so do you guys think any other movies would work? Here's what I got so far:

1. Predator  
2. Predators  
3. Alien vs. Predator  
4. Alien vs. Predator: Requiem  
5. Predators  
6. Blade Runner  
7. Ghost in the Shell (1996)  
8. Blade Runner 2049  
9. Prometheus  
10. Alien: Covenant  
12. 11. Alien  
13. Aliens  
14. Alien 3  
15. Alien: Ressurrection  

I did originally have Ex Machina set in here, which would have been the film that shows the creation of the replicants and how they became unleashed to the world, but sadly I found out that I guess the film takes place in the 2020s, which wouldn't line up as replicants were created in the mid-2010s.


EDIT 1: I'm actually now thinking that Back to the Future could fit in this universe. It all fits together, right? There are flying cars in 2015 in Back to the Future Part II, and they also exist in 2019 in Blade Runner.

EDIT 2: Also, I'm thinking 2001: A Space Odyssey could also make sense in this timeline. Replicants wouldn't be created until the mid-2010s, but the first computer AI could have been created beforehand. I mean, replicants are clearly more sophisticated than Hal 9000.

EDIT 3: I'm adding in Seinfeld. Why? Well, it's amazing, and it also doesn't contradict anything considering it's a show about nothing, so I'm putting it in god dammit! </TEXT>

I really enjoy Deadpool, but I would definitely hesistate putting it on this list. Logan came out just a month or so ago, so I really don't trust my instincts enough to put in on here, hence why no movies from 2016 or 2017 are on this list. And The Martian and Interstellar, while they were good, I found them to be a little bit overrated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cool. I masturbated a lot before this, but I'd never let myself cum because the feeling when building up seemed good enough, and I was nervous. Then again, I probably couldn't actually ejaculate when I started to masturbate </TEXT>

<TEXT> Martin Luther King Jr because he fought for fundamental equality using the most powerful weapon immaginable - words.

John F. Kennedy because he made great achievements for the US and he stood for honesty and integrity.

Abraham Lincoln because he freed the slaves and tried his best to bring unity. He also claimed to never tell a lie, and I would like to assume this is true.

My grandfather because even though he had countless disabilities and setbacks in life, he never once complained and he loved living.

And Martin Scorsese because I too aspire to be a filmmaker, and he's one of the best ones out there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> She has all of the following:


Early 20s, I think she just graduated college before teaching us

Short brown hair

Perfect teeth

Well trimmed eyebrows

Plump, but not too plump lips

Long eyelashes

Brown eyes

VERY short, I think she may be 4'11

Very nice, ahem, assets. Not huge or anything, but given she's very tiny, they look very nice

I'm not sure what her nationality is at all. My guess is she's half-white and half-hispanic. Her skin tone is white. </TEXT>
