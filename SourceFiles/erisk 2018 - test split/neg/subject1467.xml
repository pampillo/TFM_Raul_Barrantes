<TEXT> I think that segment is a minority, but gets more attention due to some of the outlandishness

Oh yes, no argument there. The ideal that men and women, people of different ethnic and class backgrounds, gender and sexual minorities, all deserve equal rights and protections is fast becoming a moderate centrist viewpoint. But far too often the left is represented to the rest of society by people who are only in it to bully, complain, blame others for societies ills and shit like that. I think liberalism is a very positive force in society but it needs to be represented less by loud students and more by the rest of us. </TEXT>

<TEXT>   History Channel show

History channel is your source? Hahahahahahahaha.

 There are dozens of posts that say I'm right

There are also dozens of posts that say the earth is flat, or hollow, that lizard people live among us and that vaccines do not work.

Show me a post written by an actual historian instead of just some guy that saw it on mythbusters.

 which I've already **answered** as being unlikely. 

No, you have **claimed** it as unlikely, you have also claimed you are a "one eyed pirate", It is a simple fact that a person going about on shipboard or involved in any kind of fight is not going to cover one eye and lose not only depth perception but also cut back on their range of vision, a person would cut off a thirty degree arc of their vision by covering one eye and that is not going to happen.

What they are leaning on is there is no manual found that supports the claim. Well I can't imagine pirates were great with keeping detailed notes.

Yeah you see the thing is history is based upon what can reasonably be proven as having happened. Again, show me any valid historical source for this idea. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A person with one eye sees things differently than a person with two eyes because of binocular vision, if a person is going to be fighting with sword, cannon and smaller firearms, moving around on the deck of a rocking ship,going up into the riggings of a sailing ship, throwing grappling lines, and all of the other dangerous and physical stuff that a pirate does they are not going to hobble themselves by destroying their depth perception by covering one eye.

 Can you explain why, if there was some advantage to be gained by wearing an eye patch during naval combat that only pirates would be doing it and not regular navy as well as armed merchant vessels defending themselves from attack?

The entire idea is based on the assumption that a pirate engaged in a fight would be continuously moving from the open deck to the darkest below decks. I just do not see a lot of reason for this, If you are engaging a ship with cannon, pirate ships were generally smaller and would have their cannon on the [weather deck](http://imgur.com/a/ecw3p) If you had a ship large enough that they had[ lower gun decks](http://imgur.com/a/ObCnR) they are quite well lit and hardly dark enough to cause a person any trouble. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of the most bizarre bits of fake history I have seen recently is that people have taken the trope of illustrators portraying fictional pirates as wearing an eye patch and have built this elaborate fantasy in which all actual pirates wear eye patches even with no eye injury, for the purpose of maintaining their night vision.

This is done so the pirates can flip up their eye patch when going below decks and still see well.

There is so much wrong with this idea that it is amazing and yet there are several websites that promote this to the point where I think there is some sort of organized social experiment going on to see how far a crazy idea can spread. </TEXT>

Another day Bart was telling me about how the reason all the middle east hates America is because some American tank blew the nose off the sphinx in world war two, I told him the sphinx lost its nose a long time ago and I had seen pictures from way back when showing this and he got so angry I thought he was going to punch me right there, Fucking Bart.

One day Bart told us about this time he was being released from jail for driving drunk and he had a friend of his drop his car off near the jail and he got in the car and saw his buddy had left a six pack in the car for him so naturally he starts one off in the car and as he is lowering the can he sees one of the cops that busted him looking right at him. The cop just shook his head and drove off for some damn reason. Fucking Bart. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to post on a small business website, I used to read about these guys living in horribly corrupt places in the south or Midwest where they would have to deal with the most pointless code enforcement crap that was blatantly just a way to raise revenue and they just accepted being shookdown as a cost of doing business but the moment I mention I am from California they would not stop with the fox news crap about our job destroying regulations and shit. Unless I really want to pollute the air, water or land I deal with damn little regulations.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> See what the hood looks like in both daytime and night time. Call a pizza delivery place and see if they deliver there after dark. Drive around the streets in a three block radius and look for train tracks, freeways, bars on windows, homeless hangouts, see what kind of business's are around. Go into a few and see if there is a bullet "proof" partition separating you from the cashier.

Open every cabinet and look under the stove for roaches and poop. Look for diatomaceous earth, (white powder used for bedbugs) in the corners of the bed room. Look for shopping carts abandoned in front of apartments. 

Try to check it out on a Saturday afternoon when people are around living their lives to see if you can hear normal conversation through the walls. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would have to respectfully disagree with you, if you look at chickens raised commercially for meat they live miserable lives. They are specially bred and hybridized to go from hatchling to killing weight in around two months or less.

 In order to do this all of their instinctive behavior have been bred out of them except for eating as much as possible. They move as little as possible because movement = weight loss so they just stand there with their mouth half open and their eyes half closed in crowded conditions trying to breath.

 Once they reach killing weight there is a rush to get them to the processor as they will start dropping dead from heart failure.

Then you look at egg chickens. When an egg chicken is hatched it is sorted in to males and females with the males killed immediately.
For the females what sort of life they get varies with some places better than others but even the best means crowded conditions and a short life becoming soup or cat food at about eighteen months.

Even with all the economizing poultry producers have a razor thin profit margin. Putting these products on the table cheap enough that poor folks can afford them does not allow for many frills.

Now lets look at game cocks, anyone who is in this seriously does whatever they can to raise the best birds which means the best conditions, best food, medical care when they get sick, access to sunshine and grass and sex with hens. Here are some pics of game farms and game cocks so [you can see what they look like](https://www.google.com/search?q=game+farm source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ved=0ahUKEwi_ibyZwoLTAhWNUSYKHcKGDaQQ_AUICygE biw=1366 bih=633#tbm=isch q=game+fowl+farm * imgrc=_)

A good gamecock is worth hundreds of dollars and by the standards of American cockfighting would be raised for two years before being mature enough to be allowed to fight in a match. Many different cultures practice cockfighting so they may have different practices.

 I understand that fight is controversial to say the least among people who do not participate but in nature, for many animals fighting and aggression are an imperative fact of life, roosters have a very short list of things they want to do today and fighting is pretty much at the top of that list  and what the cockfighter does is hardly worse than what a man who hunts with a hawk or a bow or a man who fishes with a hook does and these are thought socially acceptable and respectable by most.

A cockfighter on the other hand must accept a raid from a swat team and having his wife and children held at gunpoint while his birds are all summarily killed to save them from dying and then be locked up in a prison with killers and rapists. </TEXT>

A semi auto with a laser sight.

We were shining the laser sight on the walls and passing it around and one guy pointed it at his face and was about to switch the laser on when I covered it with my hand and explained to him that could permanently damage the eye.

And we all checked that the gun was not loaded before handling so do not worry about that too much. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Back in the days of slavery and Jim Crow laws blacks in some areas were restricted either by law or social convention from certain occupations and ways of making money, they could not raise cattle or horses (not as their own boss) but they could raise chickens.

The best way for a small scale chicken operation to make bucks in those days was to slaughter a few chickens and fry them up, put on your best clothes, and go down to the train station when a train was passing through and sell to people right though the train windows.

So many people saw blacks doing this that it became a meme.

<TEXT> Here's the thing, the felt effects of having an unregulated mass of primarily poor and under educated immigrants flow across our border is going to be unevenly distributed across society with those with higher levels of wealth, education, and power enjoying only benefits of lower labor costs and those with lower levels of wealth, education, and power having to deal with the negative effects, having our wages held down, having to deal with people who bring a high level of cultural chauvinism, seeing factories and work crews that, when they were English speaking were open to anybody, turn into Spanish speaking work areas where only Latin Americans are hired and anyone else is excluded and shut out. 

You have to understand that your ideology is one that does not reflect the reality that I and many others are forced to deal with and I cannot afford it any more than I can afford a new luxury car. You can chose to involve yourself in these issues, for me it is forced on me.

And your tendency to declare anyone you disagree with as a "moral degenerate" shows something I have known for years, that for most progressives your emotional addiction to self righteousness is your only stake in this issue.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> Proposition 187 passed easily because during the eighties there was a economic downturn in Mexico followed by a massive surge in immigration to the U.S.. Many chicano activists took this as a sign that their time had come and went on a loony binge lasting years.


If you opened a newspaper or turned on a news program in California you would be treated to chicano activists claiming that illegal immigrants from Mexico had a greater right to live in California than people of other ethnicities that were born here, demanding that non-Mexican teachers be fired from their jobs even if they could speak Spanish, demanding that Chicano activists be given special access to children in schools in order to promote an aztlanist set of beliefs and pushing the belief that if poor and uneducated people moved here from Mexico and remained poor and uneducated it was societies fault and responsibility.

 I remember turning on the TV and seeing protesters waving the Mexican flag and screaming MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO!and burning the American flag.

 When you have millions of people crossing a border to another country there are things you can do to either increase or decrease the likelihood of them being accepted, welcomed and successful and burning the flag of the land you have moved to and demanding special treatment and privileges that immigrants from other countries do not need is not helpful and if people voted for proposition 187 the progressive activist left had a lot to do with it </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's the thing, I live in southern California and Latinos do commit a disproportionate amount of the violence in my community. It is not the ones who moved here as adults because they are working to provide for their families but their sons and daughters often get pulled into a Chicano gang culture that normalize violence to such an extent that one young man will stab another young man just like him to death simply over which side of the main street his family lives.

So you can take this info and write a study that shows the immigrants causing less crime than citizens born here without truly taking into account how much crime is caused by immigration.

Studies at best serve as flawed indicators when dealing with complex issues especially when many of these studies tend to be authored by university professors that would forever be labeled as "the racist professor" if they say something offensive. </TEXT>

Well you could use logic, fact, and reason to demonstrate how bad the GOP is, you know, like an adult?

You will never win anyone over to your side by calling them stupid, you win them over by showing them truth. Over and over and over.

<TEXT> It is hard to reply to your post because your point is incomplete , are you implying I am making an assumption that the killers are named Archuleta? If that is the case there are later articles that name them. Or are you saying that a black can be named Archuleta? If that is what you mean, that is why I said "you may be making assumptions" to take into account the small percentage of Archuletas that are black. </TEXT>

One day a woman about fifty who looked kind of at the end of her rope came in and talked to the guys about how she was putting on a play and wanted to borrow a "six shooter". She was gently turned down and when she left I was told she would have killed herself with that gun. </TEXT>

 The wife harasses her husband into coming over and harassing me about the trees on my land, wanting to trim or remove them and I have tried to be accommodating but it has just trained them to think they will get what they want from me so now I have to put on my angry redneck face when dealing with them so they will learn to stay on their own fucking side. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It looks Belgian, but it also looks different than any revolver I have seen, it might be rare. If you pull the trigger and the cylinder rotates and the hammer rises and falls it is operational. I think British law might let you keep it if it is for an obsolete cartridge but you would want to research that fully rather than take my word for it. It really seems a shame to turn it in if it has been in the family that long but jail sucks. </TEXT>

Hwat the hell did you just freaking say about me, you little bobby? I'll have you know I graduated at the top of my class in the sales of propane and propane acessories, and I've been involved in numerous secret propane raids on Thatherton Fuels, and I have over 300 confirmed sales. I am trained in grilla warfare and I'm the top salesman in the entire Strickland Propane company. I will wipe you the hell out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before in arlen, mark my god danged words. You think you can get away with saying that crap to me over the phone? Think again, boy. As we speak I am contacting my group of redneck friends across the street and your number is being traced right now so you better prepare for hell, hippie. The hell that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your charcoal grill. You're freaking dead, boy. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can sell to you in over 700 different ways. and thats just with my grill catalog. Not only am I extensively trained in the sales of propane and propane acessories, but I have access to the entire propane and grill stock of Strickland Propane and I will use it to its full extent to sell you a grill thats off the face of the great USA, you little democrat. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" charcoal grill was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your freaking money. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price you god danged idiot. I will spill propane all over you and you will drown in it. You're freaking buying, customer.

<TEXT> I was in my sleeping bag trying to sleep and heard the sound of heavy footsteps coming toward me so I turned on my flashlight and saw nothing. 

I settled back down and the footsteps started up again and when they were about twenty feet away I turned on the flashlight, and saw nothing.

So I got my revolver out of my pack and waited, they started up again, the crunching sound in the leaves coming straight for me, crunch, crunch, and when it was about five feet away I turned my light on again and found myself facing down with a .38 a tiny little toad that was trying to reach the stream I was camping near. The sound was it hopping through the leaves. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would say there were many, many issues that brought us to this state, a right wing media that has brainwashed their followers to the point where fact and fiction mean nothing, a working class that feels ignored and shat on by elites, and the many avoidable fuckups from HRC and the DNC. Also there is the fact that mass immigration of low skill, low education workers from Mexico affects blue collar workers differently than it does university educated folks and many of the educated classes refuse to acknowledge this and prefer to just accuse of racism anyone who wants to discuss problems associated with immigration.

Also quite honestly "progressive" ideas are often represented to the rest of the country by people that are a little... well lets just say they should shut the fuck up. If you look at the vids that made Annaliese Nielsen and Zarna Joshi famous on the net you may see what I mean. There are too many immature ideologically rigid jackasses that think they can impose their crap on others and seem to live for the chance to pose as virtuous. 

If progressive folks dialed it back a bit and calmly clearly and rationally worked on the factual basics of race and gender issues instead of being on a constant search for ever more pointless and minute crap to criticize people for it would help.

What does not help is this "all whites are racist, only whites are racist" crap and nuts saying if a straight man will not have sex with a transgender woman who still has a penis that there is something wrong with him and all this crap about cultural appropriation. Who gives a fuck if some white guy has dreads?  </TEXT>

I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in Harvard Law School, and I've been involved in numerous  pretrial conferences, and I have over 300 peremptory challenges. I am trained in jurisprudence and I'm the top lawyer in the entire county. You are nothing to me but just another defendant. I will wipe you the fuck out with evidence the likes of which has never been seen before in this court, mark my fucking sworn testimony. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, appellant. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of colleagues from the ABA and your subpoena is being served right now so you better prepare for the consecutive sentences, maggot. The legal decicion that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your disposable income. You're fucking indicted, kid. I can litigate anywhere, anytime, and I can get you convicted in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my oral argument. Not only am I extensively trained in legal theory, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States legal library and I will use it to its full extent to annul your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what billable hours your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have pleaded nolo contendre. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying for your tort, you goddamn idiot. I will shit jargon all over you and your appeal will be dismissed with prejudice. You're fucking guilty, kiddo. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Clinton was not part of any hateful, radical, toxic, social justice feminist movement.

While that is true I think it is a part of Trumps win (not the main part, but a part) that people look at the internet and news and see "SJWs" behaving terribly, expressing their hate for white males, their contempt for rural blue collar whites and blocking off freeways people use to get to work and paths and bridges students get to class.

They look at this and expect nothing but hate and self-righteousness from the left. Trumps win was a backlash against many issues and this is just one of them

Also from his Wiki " In 2002, Duke pleaded guilty to defrauding supporters by falsely claiming to be impoverished and in danger of losing his home in order to solicit emergency donations; at the time, Duke was financially secure and used the donations for recreational gambling" </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you were to go back to American revolutionary war or Napoleonic war times a sergeant might be armed with a spontoon or similar polearm, this could be used to defend himself in close combat, or could be used to direct fire. 

  If he was carrying a longarm he might be paying more attention to reloading or sighting at an individual instead of being aware of the big picture of troop movement and directing the troops under his command.

   I think all of this can be applied to the question at hand plus having a fully automatic weapon in the hands of an NCO meant that it would be carried by an experienced soldier that would use it to its best effect in placing or replying to an ambush instead of spraying in a panic. </TEXT>

Like this; " after Obama became president and didn't condone BLM even after the insane shit they've done,"  did you mean to say "condemn" instead of condone? And this " no one is talking about things that haven't happened" Is that not the point of this post, things that have not happened?

Yeah, what it says is dash cams are pretty much required in Russia if you want car insurance, other countries, not so much. I am not discounting the whole macho culture of Russia as a factor and this could just be a traditional scam but the reason you see so many Russian vids is so dang many cameras.

<TEXT> Right wing talk shows made Trumps rise much easier because they normalized the extremes of hyperbole and demonized the left to such an extent that some people are willing to accept that President Obama is a homosexual Muslim Kenyan. Once you get a group of people acting like that it makes it easier for a snake oil salesman to seem presidential.

<TEXT>  You get blamed for slavery because you fought a war to try and keep it then spent 100 years denying blacms equal rights
 
Really? I did that? No, saying that white blue collar males fought for slavery then who was fighting against it? White blue collar males that is who. My family fought on the union side. Your assumptions are just off the charts.
 
 
 You get told mass immigration doesn't affect jobs because it doesn't. The macroeconomic effects driving down wages aren't related to day laborers and farm hands. Immigrants are here because blue collar workers didn't want to pick grapes.
 
I corrected some of your punctuation, you are welcome.

And no you are wrong again, I do not get my info from some study written by some professor that has never worked off campus, I get my information from seeing factories that used to be majority English speaking where anyone from other cultures would be welcome, change into majority Spanish speaking factories where anyone that is not Spanish speaking is treated like a leper and ostracized from all socializing and from seeing firsthand how many of the building trades are having their wages held down by a steady influx of immigrants from Mexico. Most people moving here are fine people and I do not blame them for doing what they have to do to feed their families but it is absurd to pretend this issue effects blue collar and university educated people the same. 

Also your statement that " Immigrants are here because blue collar workers didn't want to pick grapes." is implicitly racist, you are assuming that the only job Mexicans are capable of is field labor which is untrue, they want the best jobs they can perform. 
 
 The SJW boogieman at most says "recognize being a white guy makes it harder to see what problens minorities have". If you take equal rights as an assault on your person, thats on you
 
I did not criticize people for working for equal rights, I criticized them for spewing hatred toward people because of their race, class and gender which is a huge part of that segment of "progressive" thought that is common among people  called SJWs  if you are unable to tell the difference lurk more.  
 
 Idk man still seems like you dont have a leg to stand on

No actually I do, if fact much of your post proves my point that lefty prejudice against white male blue collar workers is a real thing and explains why so many will vote for an orange buffoon. 

Face facts, you are part of the problem.

<TEXT> A huge part of how things got to this state is that when you talk about "liberals" in the US you are almost always talking about university educated people.

 If you are an uneducated white blue collar male and you listen to the left you are going to be on the receiving end of constant vitriol and hate directed at "ignorant rednecks" and "hillbillies".

 We get blamed for slavery, which mostly benefited the rich and educated, we are told if mass latin American immigration does not affect educated classes negatively then it does not matter if it lowers our wages and restricts our job opportunities and if we want our voices heard on the subject we get called racist.

 As well as listening to a never ending stream of "Hate, hate, hate the white male" from the more loony SJWs.

Is it really any wonder that folks like this would reject everything about the left and follow Trump? What other choice do they have? It is like a drowning man clutching at straws.

<TEXT> aztlanists believe that the southwestern part of the United States which we took from Mexico in a war a century and a half ago will always be Mexico and was once part of a great Aztec empire and that people that move here from Mexico have a greater right to live here than non-Mexican people that were born here. Plus an unhealthy commitment to victimhood as a part of cultural pride and a belief that anyone that does well in school and advances through their own initiative is "trying to act white". It was a big deal in the eighties and nineties but most Mexicans in the US today pretty much reject it as being a permanent victim of society does not pay very well or make you many friends. </TEXT>

Now we are bitches for every scheming grifter and the courts order us to bend over and take it with no lube.

<TEXT> I used to work in a factory in my city, when I started it was staffed by men and women from many different cultural backgrounds. During my time there I worked with people from all over and we got along pretty well.

 Once Mexicans became the majority things changed, they stopped speaking English unless they were talking to a boss and kept a loud conversation going at all times all in Spanish. If you could not speak Spanish they would exclude you and talk about you openly in a language you could not reply in.

 It changed from a place where anyone from anywhere could work and be one of the team to a place with an in-group and an out group. I tried talking with one of the more socially active lead workers and told her it would be friendlier if she could speak English some of the time. She loudly told me "This is Mexico!"

A week later she got angry at me and turned around and started loudly saying crap about me in Spanish in a horrible tone of voice to the rest of the room which went absolutely silent while she tore into me saying I know not what. It was humiliating in a way I cannot describe.

After that one of the bosses asked why I look so sad all the time and I said, without naming anyone, that they talk about me in a language I cannot understand and it hurt me. He told another boss who told the lead I was having trouble with who started telling as many stories as she could to the second boss, he called me into his office and gave me an angry chewing out, asked me to quit and threatened to fire me.

I eventually quit but on my own terms at a time of my choosing after the second boss got fired for being useless. The angry lead person is now in his position.

I usually keep this to myself as folks with a progressive viewpoint tend to assume I had to be at fault and I have had people demand that I reveal the name of this factory and act like they have proven some great point when I will not name it but I live in a small city and do not need to get dragged through the mud again.

The reason why this went so bad was it was the eighties and there was a huge amount of very toxic aztlanist latino activism going on in my state so I do not think the same situation would happen today.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a one man business, a sole proprietor manufacturing business in California, I make parts for one company only and I occasionally will make more parts than have been ordered for the sake of efficiency. Occasionally I will be stuck with parts that do not get re-ordered or my customer may change his specs and I am stuck with unsalable stock.

  Can I and how should I express this as a loss on my taxes? Can I use my customers price as the base for this? can I only take off this year what I made this year? 

Any help is much appreciated. </TEXT>

<TITLE> So I went to a Californio Bridlehorse Association thing </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-22 06:53:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT>   They describe it as "Early Californio skills of the rancho" and it was very different from any rodeo I have seen, there is a strong emphasis on historical equipment such as [rawhide riatas](http://imgur.com/tB30aFu) as well as old [traditional vaquero reining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosal). There is also a general respect between rider, horse, and cattle with the rider and horse moving in a much more fluid almost intuitive style compared to other stockmans competition I have seen.

There is also a strong emphasis on being able to work the cattle gently so as to not spook or injure them or run off any precious weight.

The competition involved a few different sorting, penning, and roping exhibitions and while it was about the slowest and least exciting rodeos I have seen it was also among the most beautiful to watch with many subtleties that I am sure escaped the eye of a non-rider like myself. Actually seeing riders throw figure eight loops so as to catch the steers neck with one loop and a front leg or two with the other was a real treat and seeing real [cattlemen](http://i.imgur.com/sBZgjKk.jpg) some of whom looked as ancient as the hills also added to the beauty of the competition. 

I would very much recommend checking out the [Californio Bridlehorse Association](http://www.californiobridlehorseassociation.com/), reading up on them and seeing their next show. </TEXT>
