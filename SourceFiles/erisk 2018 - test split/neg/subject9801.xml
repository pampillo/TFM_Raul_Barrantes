**However, as long as Trump compiles lists of immigrant crimes and the religious right continues demonizing transgender folks, I'll keep documenting how naughty and criminal religious leaders are.** </TEXT>

Oh, you had an abortion? Hope your doctor isn't a Christian when you go for that follow up appointment!

Oh, you want birth control? Hope your doctor isn't a raging Catholic!

Oh, you're gay? Hope you like the idea of getting kicked out of a restaurant because the owner is a bigot piece of shit.

**EDIT:** Just so we're clear, yes, although **he is a murdering fucking maniac,** Duterte is the leader of a major nation. Trump should definitely keep an open line of communication. However, that doesn't mean he has to invite a murderer to the damn white house.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know what it is with theists and not using words properly. Words have definitions for a reason, and they're pretty damn important. 

First, if your entire religion is based on FAITH, then you can't have a perfect knowledge of God's existence. You need not have faith for things that you know. 

Then, and this is my favorite, if you can only "prove" God's existence to those who already share belief in your delusion, then you can't, by definition, prove shit. 

Also, she brought up the "I can feel God just like I can feel the wind so that DEFINITELY proves he's real."

No, honey, there is a huge goddamn difference between feeling the physical sensation of  wind hitting your face and having some warm fuzzy emotions after you've gotten down on your little bitty knees and said an incantation to your fake God. 

I get warm and fuzzy feelings when I listen to certain music, does that mean that the front man of Tool fucking died for my sins? No. 

Fucking hell, ya'll. The delusions are extreme in the south.  </TEXT>

The crime? He had posted blasphemous and offensive content on FB.

<TITLE> The TBM narrative is that the BOM is superior to the Bible due to it being divinely revealed and interpreted by JS. If the BOM is superior to the Bible, then why the hell are there errors - WORD FOR WORD - unique to a specific 1769 KJV edition of the Bible in the BOM? The BOM is an obvious fraud. </TITLE>

<TEXT> I recently found myself sitting in sacrament meeting (a friend was giving a talk so I was there solely to support a friend) and one of the speakers said something I've heard a million times before --- but it really stuck with me this time. 

He went on and on about how the BOM was divinely translated by JS and that the Bible is riddled with errors and only correct as far as it is translated correctly -- and the BOM is obviously superior to the Bible because JS had divine guidance protecting him from erring when he translated the BOM. 

Well, that's nice and all, but if the BOM was divinely translated --- and is free from error --- unlike the Bible --- then why the hell are there errors specific to a 1769 KJV edition of the Bible -- an edition that JS would have been familiar with -- in the Book of Mormon? 

If it is so perfect and free from error regarding translation, why are the very same errors present in the Bible found in the BOM? 

TBM's love the say that the Bible is riddled with errors and mistranslations ---- and that the BOM is perfect and without error --- without even realizing that many of the errors found in 1700's versions of the Bible are also in the BOM. 

This should be a huge shelf breaker for everyone. The BOM is a fraud and there is no escaping that fact.  


I know I'm preaching to the choir here, but I'm just baffled by TBM's who can't see that their very same criticisms of the Bible can be directly applied to their precious BOM as well.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was no mistake that right to free speech and the right to freedom of religion are found in the same amendment, the first. 

However, Christians seem to forget that fact the moment their beliefs are challenged or criticized. 

"How dare you insult my religion!" they say. "Hate speech!!" they say. 

Do they not realize that the very same amendment that gives them the right to freely practice their religion also gives anyone else the right to verbally mock their religion? 

The two go hand in hand. 

Not being able to handle criticism of your religion demonstrates weakness and immaturity. 

Christians love that the first amendment provides them with freedom of religion, but they absolutely hate the freedom of speech part. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The narrative many TBMs embrace is that many of Joseph Smith's polygamous marriages were sexless. I call bullshit. Brigham Young and JS both took dozens of wives, some mere teenagers. Brigham Young had children with many of his wives. If BY was banging all his wives, JS likely was, too. </TITLE>

<TEXT> Brigham Young and Joseph Smith were both leaders in the early church, and both practiced polygamy. 

A lot of TBM's will attempt to rationalize Smith's polygamy and his marriage to 14 year old girls by attempting to argue that Joseph smith didn't have sex with all his wives, and certainly not the teenage ones. 

Problem being? Brigham Young [fathered children](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Brigham_Young's_wives) with many of his plural wives, **even the teenage ones.** See Clarissa Caroline Decker. 

If Joseph smith and Brigham Young were both receiving revelation from god, and were both practicing plural marriage, why the hell would Brigham get to have sex with his wives and Joseph not? 

My message to the church and members: Quit with the mental gymnastics and just admit that Joseph banged all his wives. These attempts at denial are truly pathetic.  </TEXT>

How the hell does that make sense considering the entire premise of Christianity is that human beings are so inherently evil and awful that we desperately need saving? 

They believe that humans are awful and that religion provides the only solution to that vile human nature..... yet they are surprised when sick fucks end up next to them in the church pew on Sunday?

They believe that their [last Imam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_al-Mahdi) lives in occultation and will one day return to [fight the devil with sweet baby Jesus.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Coming#Islam)

Christians believe in the rapture, and that Jesus is going to return for all his people.

How is it that millions of people around the world, even in different religions and cultures, are convinced that men who lived thousands and thousands of years ago are going to return and save us all?

<TEXT> In 1850, you could marry 40 women and black people couldn't get baptized. All because of who the prophet was and what time period it was.

Now, with different prophets and apostles and 150 years later, black people are welcomed and marriage is solely one man and one woman (according to the church).

What changed? It seems that those beliefs are relative to who the prophet is and what time period it is, not absolute because "God."

Any time a TBM tells me that the church rejects moral relativism I absolutely fucking face palm. 

Members and church leaders can say all they want that "God doesn't change his mind," but the history of Mormon beliefs PROVE that either 1. God changes his mind a lot, or 2. the Mormon Prophet and his apostles aren't truly led by an unchanging, infallible God... they are just making decisions based on what they think is best, or based on their own preconceived notions of how things should be.

A few years ago, Utah was ranked 15th for suicide. **Now it is ranked #5.**


The church, when faced with a problem, always has the same response: LIE IGNORE LIE IGNORE LIE IGNORE.

<TITLE> I am baffled when Christians ask me how atheists can have morals without religion. Their entire religion is based on the premise that a mere belief in God and repentance exonerates rape, murder, etc. and allows the wicked into Heaven, yet the moral code of an atheist is somehow more flawed? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-21 15:05:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Time and time again, I have been asked by my friends who have faith what prevents an atheist from committing various offenses from rape to murder to thievery if they do not have a moral code grounded in a belief in a higher power, eternal life, the punishment of hell, etc. 

Logically, if you turn the tables, it is actually the theist (in this particular case the Christian) who has very little stopping them from committing various offenses.

For example, according to the Christian, you can murder, rape, pillage, steal, commit genocide.... but if you ask sweet baby Jesus to come into your little bitty heart and save you, all your evil sins are wiped away and you will live in forever happiness in Heaven. 

Yet the atheists are somehow more likely to rape and pillage because they *don't* believe that they can be magically forgiven and exonerated for any terrible act? Please.


**EDIT:** I understand this point of view is espoused by various belief systems, not just Christianity. I also understand that not all Christians think that atheists cannot possibly be moral. Where I live, I don't encounter many Hindus or Muslims, so evangelicals in particular tend to get my goat more than others.

The notion that BDSM and other taboo sex is tolerable....but a movie with gay characters is not? That's fucking absurd.  </TEXT>

**EDIT:** Not to mention the fact that these religious folks are ignoring the **bestiality** in the movie and hating on the gays.

Also, I'd like to point out that I don't have a problem with BDSM at all. The point I was trying to make is that religious folks take more offense to a gay character than taboo sex or bestiality in the film.

<TITLE> I've made this point before, but it's worth repeating. Joseph Smith broke the very commandment he claimed God had revealed to him in D C 132. He married women who weren't virgins, and women who had already been married. That would be like if Monson drank Starbucks and Uchtdorf got gay married. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-04 20:21:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> D C 132:61 explicitly states: "And again, as pertaining to the law of the priesthoodif any man espouse a virgin, and desire to espouse another, and the first give her consent, and if he espouse the second, and they are virgins, and have vowed to no other man, then is he justified; he cannot commit adultery for they are given unto him; for he cannot commit adultery with that that belongeth unto him and to no one else."

Problem being? Joseph married women who had been married previously and thus obviously weren't virgins. [Link.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Joseph_Smith's_wives)

Also a fun fact, one of the wives, Zina D.H. Young,  married **both Joseph Smith and Brigham Young.** [Link.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zina_D._H._Young)



Joseph claimed God had given him D C as divine revelation, but then him and Brigham Young both violated the commandment they claimed was from God. 

That would be like if Monson always had a full starbucks cup at General Conference and Uchtdorf brought his husband.... all while preaching against the evils of coffee and homosexuality.  </TEXT>

However, when a **simple power-point** leaks proving that the church lied to members in regard to why Elder Oaks went to Idaho (**hint: it was because of widespread apostacy**), the church immediately threatens legal action and sends fancy letters from lawyers that are no doubt overpaid using tithing money. 

We caught them in a lie... a lie that apparently they think will hurt. 

Don't let anyone forget!

For the sake of being 100% clear, [HERE](http://kutv.com/news/local/lds-church-holds-special-meeting-to-denounce-false-prophet) is a link where church spokesman Eric Hawkins said, in no uncertain terms, that "Elder Oaks was not scheduled for an assignment that weekend so decided to use his free time to visit an area with a concentration of members, knowing that some members have questions from time to time that trouble them."

In the power point leak, it specifically says [Elder Oaks trip to Idaho **to address apostasy.**](http://imgur.com/a/c1Q8i)

Not at all! I get that all Christians believe a little different, but this seems to be a common occurrence in evangelical circles --- picking apart the bits they like about the OT, and ignoring the rest.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a conversation with a believing friend that went a little something like this: 

Homosexuality is evil. It says so right there in Leviticus 18. 

Then, during another argument about immigration, I cited Leviticus 19, merely **one chapter later,** which says that you are to treat foreigners as your native born, and the same Christian told me "that's old testament, we don't have to follow that." 

I almost laughed. He literally told me that you don't have to follow the OT, after previously having a conversation about how gay people are supposed to follow the OT.  </TEXT>

For fucks sake, most mothers I know didn't even realize they were pregnant until 5-6 weeks! 

Accuse me of "lying" all you want, but banning abortion at 6 weeks is effectively a total ban on abortion.

<TEXT> "When a foreigner resides among you in your land, do not mistreat them. The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt. I am the LORD your God." Leviticus 19:34

I'd say the law of the land (deport all illegals, even nonviolent criminals with children) definitely conflicts with God's law of loving others as ourselves and treating foreigners as our "native-born."

<TEXT> Do you really think bathroom bills are going to stop transfolks from pissing? 

Here's what will happen. When a nice transwoman wearing a pretty pink dress and lip stick is told she can't pee in the ladies room because that wasn't her birth gender, she will just use the men's room.... **with your boys.**

What do you think will be more confusing to children? Someone who looks and dresses like a woman using the ladies room? Or someone who looks and dresses like a woman using the men's room? 


Transpeople aren't going to stop pissing, and bills like this only make the situation more contentious and confusing. 

Also, quit acting like you give a fuck about the safety of women and children. If you did, you'd be banning sex offenders from the lavatory instead of innocent transpeople.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the baptism interview, one is asked: "Have you ever committed a crime?" 

For many Hispanic investigators or church members, they are faced with an impossible decision: lie to their church, or be honest and possibly face consequences for the victim-less crime of immigrating illegally. 

If this has happened to you or anyone you'd know, I'd love to hear your story. 


The interview question I'm referring to is most common in baptism interviews, and can be found [here.](http://www.lds4u.com/Discussions/Interview.htm) </TEXT>

<TEXT> No doubt! We got some massive changes into the platform --- however, on other issues, we were ignored. 

There were some things we didn't get massive concessions on --- such as moving towards a system where every state's primary is open (meaning you don't have to be a registered Dem to vote in the primary) and we certainly haven't gained much ground when it comes to getting rid of superdelegates entirely. 

Also, the whole DNC working behind the scenes for Hillary was kind of a massive "fuck you!"  </TEXT>

<TITLE> I'm here to share what is most likely an unpopular opinion, but hear me out. I've heard so much about "punishing the Dems" and "teaching them a lesson." We need to focus on building bridges and strengthening the resistance, not burning bridges. That doesn't mean foregoing our ideals. </TITLE>

<TEXT> Here is the simple truth: If we do nothing for the next 4 years but focus on punishing the dems for the 2016 primary and teaching them a lesson, Trump will get 8 years instead of 4. 


The Democratic party isn't perfect, not by a long shot, but **change will happen from WITHIN.** Build bridges with your local democrats. Fight where a fight is warranted, but WORK TOGETHER to build a strong resistance. 

Building bridges with the Democrats does not mean giving up our ideals. We still want single payer! We still want tuition free college! We still want Citizens United GONE. 

But we will never accomplish any of those goals if we burn bridges with the democrats and do nothing but alienate and "punish" them for the next 4 years. 

**TL;DR:** The Democrats alienated Bernie supporters. Is that infuriating? **Yes.** In turn, because the Democrats alienated Bernie supporters, they got fucked in the election. If we turn around and alienate them, does that hurt our cause? **Yes!** Work together. Change the party from within. Do not give up on what we're fighting for! </TEXT>

Between 9/11 and now, there have only been around ~3,000 deaths on American soil due to terrorism. [link.](https://www.start.umd.edu/pubs/START_AmericanTerrorismDeaths_FactSheet_Oct2015.pdf) That's 3,000 in 16 years compared to 15,000 gun deaths EVERY YEAR.

In 2000, the supreme court ruled that student led prayer at football games is unconstitutional. The case was santa fe independent school district v. Doe. 

If it was student led, still unconstitutional. If it were led by a random crowd member, I don't know if that has been litigated yet. Considering it appears that the man who led the prayer is a youth pastor, I imagine there would be issues with coaches allowing a member of the clergy access to the students at a school sponsored event for religious purposes. </TEXT>

Contrary to what you've said, the courts have ruled REPEATEDLY that coaches and other school employees are NOT permitted to participate in prayer or religious activities in their capacity as school employees, as that would constitute an endorsement of religion.

Trump pretends to be Christian anytime it is convenient for him. He lies about where he goes to church. [1.](http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/28/politics/donald-trump-church-member/)

Trump didn't know that it is "2nd Corinthians, not "two Corinthians." [2.](http://www.npr.org/2016/01/18/463528847/citing-two-corinthians-trump-struggles-to-make-the-sale-to-evangelicals)

Trump also said he never asked God for forgiveness. [3.](http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/18/politics/trump-has-never-sought-forgiveness/)

But anytime Trump wants to woo Christian voters, he brings along a platoon of prosperity gospel ministers and **pretends** to be a Christian. 


Muslim refugees should just take a leaf out of Trump's book and the GOP playbook and just pretend to love sweet baby Jesus. Trump would let them right on in.  </TEXT>

Tillerson ran exxon mobile, a company that doesn't give two shits about the environment, and now he's secretary of state.

<TEXT> I tend to agree with you. I'm not seriously advocating that we ban registered sex offenders from public restrooms. First, it would be damn near impossible to enforce. 

However, if these religious lawmakers really wanted to "protect women and kids," going after sex offenders would be more believable than going after transgender folks. 

Mandating that all churches perform background checks on anyone working with kids would be a good start, too.  </TEXT>

Time and time again, [religious right lawmakers introduce bills](http://time.com/4624009/bathroom-bill-lawmakers/) attempting to ban transgender folks from public bathrooms...as if transgender people are a danger to women and kids. All the while, there are on average 70 reports of sexual abuse in churches per week in the United states. [Link.](http://churchandstate.org.uk/2016/05/kids-more-likely-to-be-molested-at-church-than-in-transgender-bathrooms/)

Transgender folks aren't the problem. 

Where are the bills banning sex offenders from bathrooms? Where are the bills protecting kids from rapey pastors and priests? 

Oh, right... **the religious right doesn't give a fuck about real sexual assault that is happening in their own churches. They would rather demonize transgender folks than deal with the real problem.**

<TEXT>  They believe certain parts of the bible are literal, but not the entire thing.

I've never met an evangelical who says parts of the Bible are literal and others aren't. They all say the entire Bible is 100% inerrant and infallible. They literally believe woman was made from a rib, Noah got all the animals into one boat, Jesus walked on water, etc. They believe it all literally. 

Mainstream denominations, no. But all the evangelicals I know would take a bullet before saying the Bible wasn't literal.  </TEXT>

Tell that to the millions of evangelical Christians who believe the Bible is the literal, inspired word of God.

<TEXT> I will preface this comment by saying that I did not vote for Donald Trump and I in no way support any of his policies aside from **maybe** his infrastructure plan. 

That said, Islam is a fucking problem and we need to stop being pussies and fucking talk about it. 

I live near Chattanooga. I used to be friends with a chick who eventually married a Muslim she met online and moved to isis controlled syria. [Link.](https://www.buzzfeed.com/ellievhall/woman-journey-from-chattanooga-to-isis) This is a girl I was getting drunk and smoking weed with ten years ago. 

Then, there was the [Chattanooga shooter.](http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/20/us/tennessee-naval-reserve-shooting/) He went to high school with friends of mine, who actually described him as one of the nicest people they knew. 

All religions are a little fucked up in my opinion, but Islam takes the goddamn cake. Islam is the **only religion** I have ever encountered that can take normal fucking people and in a matter of months or years turn them into goddamn murdering sociopaths.

I don't know what the solution is, but we have to combat this dangerous fucking ideology or shit like this will keep happening.

I disagree with senator Cruz on almost everything, but I must tip my hat to him on this one. 

When it comes to protecting consumers and sick people, senator Cruz did a better job than 13 democrats. 

It's simple, folks. It's time to clean house. WE need to run against these senators in primaries.

<TEXT> The entire purpose of this bill is to trigger a lawsuit. They think this might be the one that guts Roe. They may be right, they may be wrong. 

From an article about the bill: "Nislys bill is meant as a test case to see if a new U.S. Supreme Court will overturn Roe v. Wade  the 1973 decision legalizing abortion.

'Its time to bring the Roe v. Wade era to its logical conclusion,'  Nisly said. 'My goal is to deregulate abortion right out of existence in Indiana.'" [Link.](http://www.journalgazette.net/news/local/indiana/Coalition-fighting-abortion-bills-17233889)

That said, either abortion is wrong, or it isn't. Whether the abortion happens at 12 weeks or 8 months makes no difference in regard to whether abortion is wrong or not. The government should not be able to dictate what medical procedures a woman can and cannot undergo, and the government certainly shouldn't be telling a woman what she can do with her vagina. But considering our next President thinks he can grab pussies whenever he pleases because he's a "star," I suppose we shouldn't be shocked.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> What is with religions cutting dicks? If you're a Jew, they cut your dick at 8 days old. If you convert as an adult, you must be circumcised. If you're already circumcised, a rabbi will prick your dick to draw blood. Some Muslims wait until puberty to circumcise their boys. WTF? Possibly NSFW. </TITLE>

<TEXT> Muslim circumcision is arguably worse than Jewish circumcision, as in some cultures they wait until 7-12 or puberty to circumcise the boys. 

Jews wait until the 8th day of life to circumcise a baby. [Link.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brit_milah#Ceremony) 

What a way to welcome a new man into the world....by cutting off part of his penis without any input from him. 

Oh, and if you want to become a Jew as an adult, you still have to get circumcised! For converts who were circumcised prior to wanting to become Jewish, there is a ritual called [hatafat dam brit](http://www.mayyimhayyim.org/using-the-mikveh/the-process-of-conversion) where a rabbi or other authorized Jew will draw a drop of blood from where your foreskin once was to symbolize your covenant with the people of Israel. 

In some branches of orthodox Judaism, the Rabbi will perform a ritual known as metzitzah b'peh, during which the rabbi will literally suck on the penis to "clean" the circumcision wound. This has actually led to babies in NYC dying after contracting herpes after this ritual. [Link.](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/baby-dies-herpes-virus-ritual-circumcision-nyc-orthodox/story?id=15888618)

I have to say it: what the fuck? 

However, not all religions are keen on cutting dicks. Hindu and Buddhist holy books make no mention of circumcision. [Link.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_male_circumcision#Asian_cultures)

In African cultures, circumcision is really terrible. No painkillers. Really awful ritual. Not safe for work video. If you have a weak stomach, do not watch. It shows an African circumcision. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvW2b9ujdWo)

What the fuck is it with religion and cutting our dicks? What the fuck?

Pope Francis [even said](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/04/23/franklin-graham-men-pretending-women-not-use-womens-restrooms/) that sex education should teach respect and appreciation for sexual differences, including self-acceptance and learning to embrace the body with which one is born, rather than playing with **fictional identities that deny reality.**


**We want to talk about fiction, mental illness and denying reality?** WOW.

* Dead men don't come back to life. 

* Men can't walk on water. 

* Virgins don't get pregnant. 

* Talking snakes aren't real. 

* You can't fit two of every fucking animal on one boat. 


Believing those things is denying reality. 

Talking to your imaginary sky fairy every goddamn morning and evening and before each meal and fearing eternal damnation in hell every day are signs of metal illness. 

To audacity of these folks never fails to blow me away.

<TITLE> Happy sunday from an atheist! I've been studying various Christian beliefs on salvation and I am VERY confused. How is salvation a free gift if you have to stop sinning (actively change your behavior) to earn it? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-08 18:20:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Full disclosure: I am a raging atheist, but I admit that I know absolutely nothing and it's 100 possible that I'm wrong. I just don't believe I am wrong, yet. It's entirely possible that one day I might discover that I am wrong. 

I've studied southern baptist theology (whew, what a trip), Lutheran theology, Calvinism, Mormon theology and I've very, very briefly studied a little bit about Adventism. 

Common themes are obviously faith, grace, works, etc. But each and every denomination seems to have a different take on it. 

Every single denomination seems to think that salvation works just a little bit differently. 

The main issue I'm having, and admittedly this is mostly in nondenominational evangelical churches, is that their explanations of salvation are either blatantly contradictory or they don't make sense at all. 

For example: One non denominational church I recently visited teaches that salvation is an unearned gift from God that we receive by repenting of all of our sins. 

Ok, so in order to get this "unearned" gift, you have to earn it by actively changing your behavior. The fact that they can explain this with a straight face, as if they aren't completely ignoring the meaning of the word "unearned," is almost laughable to me. 

If salvation is truly unearned, changing your behavior wouldn't be required. 

Not to mention that this specific church also acts as if they don't understand the meaning of the word repent, which means a change of mind (opinion/belief) regarding God. Am I wrong to say they are using the word repent wrong in this situation?

If you believe that you have to follow rules, change your behavior and do all these things in order to receive salvation, why pretend like you believe in grace and just say that you have to do the proper works? 


Another fun one I've encountered was this: 

Another church I visited teaches that irresistible grace can be resisted or received by human free will. Not to sound overly controversial, but how the heck can **IR**resistible grace be resisted? Again, it's as if they don't even realize they are being blatantly contradictory. 

Why not just admit that you don't believe in irresistible grace instead of trying to (illogically) say that irresistible grace can be resisted? 

Honestly, and I think many will be shocked to hear me say this, the Mormons are the most honest and consistent with their beliefs. 

They will tell you up front that they believe that works and ordinances are required for salvation. No sugar coating it or trying to alter definitions of words to fit a narrative specific to their theology. They will tell you that they believe that God's grace is sufficient to cover where we fall short, but that there are things (works) required of us as well. 

Help me understand. Where do you guys each fall when it comes to how salvation works? 

If Christianity is true, why are Christians so divided about how one even gets "saved?" 

Thanks for letting me ask all these crazy questions.

<TEXT> A bill has been filed in Texas that would, if passed, limit where transgender people can pee. [Link.](http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/05/us/texas-transgender-bathroom-access.html?_r=0)

Their main argument is that women and children need to be protected from those pesky men in dresses. 

First, that shows a clear lack of understanding regarding transgender people in the first place. **Do you really want someone who for all intents and purposes is female, has real boobs that grew thanks to hormone therapy, to go into the restroom with your sons instead of daughters?**

Also, where the fuck are the bills banning sex offenders from bathrooms? If we're truly concerned about the safety of women and children in restrooms, might we consider banning people **who have actually been fucking convicted of sex crimes** as opposed to poor transgender people who have never been convicted of any crime? 

I suppose that's just too much logic for those poor bastards in the Texas legislature. 


Honestly, and this is just my theory, but I think transgender folks are being used as a scapegoat here. No doubt we have an epidemic of child sexual abuse in this country. **But it ain't happening in bathrooms.... in fact, it's pretty damn common in church.**

On average, there are around 70 reports per week of children being abused sexually in American churches. [Link.](http://churchandstate.org.uk/2016/05/kids-more-likely-to-be-molested-at-church-than-in-transgender-bathrooms/)

Where are the laws banning clergy from public restrooms? Where are the laws banning sex offenders, you know people with an actual history of sex abuse, from bathrooms? FUCKING NO WHERE. 

These asshats don't care about protecting the children. They want to distract you from the real problem. 


If you live in TX and want to contact your senators regarding this legislation, you can find their contact information [here.](http://www.senate.state.tx.us/75r/Senate/Members.htm) Let them know you'd prefer they ban actual sex offenders from restrooms as opposed to innocent citizens.  </TEXT>

They want to use trans-folks as a scapegoat while ignoring the average of 70 reports/week of child sex abuse in US churches. </TITLE>

<TEXT> A bill has been filed in Texas that would, if passed, limit where transgender people can pee. [Link.](http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/05/us/texas-transgender-bathroom-access.html?_r=0)

Their main argument is that women and children need to be protected from those pesky men in dresses. 

First, that shows a clear lack of understanding regarding transgender people in the first place. **Do you really want someone who for all intents and purposes is female, has real boobs that grew thanks to hormone therapy, to go into the restroom with your sons instead of daughters?**

Also, where the fuck are the bills banning sex offenders from bathrooms? If we're truly concerned about the safety of women and children in restrooms, might we consider banning people **who have actually been fucking convicted of sex crimes** as opposed to poor transgender people who have never been convicted of any crime? 

I suppose that's just too much logic for those poor bastards in the Texas legislature. 


Honestly, and this is just my theory, but I think transgender folks are being used as a scapegoat here. No doubt we have an epidemic of child sexual abuse in this country. **But it ain't happening in bathrooms.... in fact, it's pretty damn common in church.**

On average, there are around 70 reports per week of children being abused sexually in American churches. [Link.](http://churchandstate.org.uk/2016/05/kids-more-likely-to-be-molested-at-church-than-in-transgender-bathrooms/)

Where are the laws banning clergy from public restrooms? Where are the laws banning sex offenders, you know people with an actual history of sex abuse, from bathrooms? FUCKING NO WHERE. 

These asshats don't care about protecting the children. They want to distract you from the real problem. 

If you live in TX and want to contact your senators regarding this legislation, you can find their contact information [here.](http://www.senate.state.tx.us/75r/Senate/Members.htm) Let them know you'd prefer they ban actual sex offenders from restrooms as opposed to innocent citizens.

<TEXT> Someone should ask Mr. Stivers exactly how one "chooses" to conceive. Last time I checked, we have very little control over whether or not we get pregnant when we fuck. There are so many factors in play. Ovulation, sperm count, etc. 

Or is he suggesting that anyone who has sex is "choosing" to conceive? Because that's just not true. If the only purpose of sex was to make a baby, porn wouldn't exist.

I can personally say with 100% honestly that I have never once chosen to conceive any of the times I've had sex in my 28 years of life.  </TEXT>

I agree with you 1000000%. However, you cannot deny that the two issues (abortion and contraception) are linked. If women had access to birth control in the same way they do advil, the abortion rate would drop drastically.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Guess what prevents abortion more than any amount of prayer, protest, legislation, etc.?

Fucking birth control. 

Guess what dramatically lowers the teen pregnancy rate? Teaching teens about how to fuck with PROTECTION, including birth control, instead of teaching abstinence and waiting for marriage. (My 6th grade health class included nothing about condoms, birth control, ovulation, etc. In lieu of all that, we signed cards promising that we wouldn't fuck until we were married. This was in a public school.) What hormone ridden 16 year old is going to fucking abstain? Very few. 

Don't come at me bitching about your pro-life dogma if you don't think birth control should be readily available to ANY woman who needs it because THAT is how you prevent abortions effectively. 

**EDIT:** shit, thanks for the gold. Now, go teach your teens about condoms and ovulation so the next generation doesn't make the same mistakes many of those in my generation made.  </TEXT>

In [D C 132](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132) (part of Mormon scripture), Joseph laid out for church members what he claimed God had given him as the rules regarding polygamy. If a man wanted to take another wife, she must be a virgin and must be vowed to no other man. Joseph smith broke BOTH of those rules, the very rules he claimed God had specifically given him outlined in D C 132.

They have both been married multiple times. 

They both have a thing for other men's wives. Trump bragged about trying to bang a married woman in the Access Hollywood leaked video, and Joseph Smith married women who were already married. Who woulda thunk it?! 

They're both con men who convince poor people to give them money. Trump University, anybody?!

Ask any Mormon, and you'll hear them tell you that the church uses the profits from it's "for profit" arm to spend on humanitarian causes. 

Let's get this straight...the church owns ranches, insurance companies, apartment buildings, tv and radio stations, etc (some of those businesses are worth billions).... and they can only afford to spend $40 million a year on humanitarian aid? 

Those numbers don't make sense to me.

[1.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Mar_Kimball#Marriage_to_Joseph_Smith)

Or, I would discuss how Prophet Joseph violated the very rules regarding polygamy that he told the church that God had given to him in D C 132. D C 132 states that if one wants to take a plural wife, she must be a virgin and she must not be vowed to any other man. Joseph smith married women who weren't virgins and who had already been married. [1.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Joseph_Smith's_wives) [2.](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132)
Joseph smith didn't even follow his own rules!

In the same way, dating and marriage and how to go about the two are taught differently by different local leaders. I've certainly heard that the primary goal in marriage is to find a partner who is temple worthy, but I wouldn't be surprised if other leaders focus more on finding a spouse you actually love.  </TEXT>

Perhaps because said religious organization is already swindling billions of dollars in tithes per year from people with good intentions and turning around and using their money to build malls, apartments and cattle ranches.

With 15 million members giving 10% every month, the Mormon Church has no need for these for profit businesses. The baptist Church down the road doesn't build million dollar apartment complexes, billion dollar malls or own one of the largest cattle ranches in the world. Because they're a legit church, not a corporation parading around as a religion ;)

And please, tell me about how all that money is "supporting missionary work." Missionaries have to raise their own money and PAY the church to go on a mission. But please, tell me more about how the church is using that money to fund missionary work....please. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  all for the sake of banging.

Gotta have them temple ordinances! But, on a serious note, a lot of young adult Mormons are taught that who you marry isn't as much about being in love... to them, it's more about finding a companion who is "worthy" to enter the temple with you. 

It's a pretty fucked up religion/culture.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Read the CES Letter. It will give you a good insight into the many, many issues with the Mormon Church, mainly that it's demonstrably false. 

Your Sister will be taught that all of her family members outside of the Mormon religion will not be able to be with her in the afterlife. If she decides to divorce her husband and leave the church after 10 years of marriage, her children will be told that their mother will be separated from them in the afterlife. That doctrine is used as a tool of manipulation to keep members and their families in the faith. 

Mormons are nice people, but the tactics they employ to sustain their religion are fucking twisted and abusive.  </TEXT>

If you have Chrome, you don't have to install TOR to reach SecureDrop. Follow these instructions instead:

* Install the skyZIP proxy extension.

* Turn it on in Chrome (click on it so it lights up green).

* Browse to http://efeip5ekoqi4upkz.onion/ (If you can't reach this site, then the extension isn't installed and turned on)

* Start leaking.

* IMPORTANT: Turn off skyNET in chrome after you are finished leaking (at least click it so it is no longer green; I go a step further and disable it in the extensions mention).

Edit to add: skyNET also has a Firefox extension. The purpose of skyNET is to reduce data on satellite Internet connections. skyNET is made by a german firm NYNEX. I'm not vouching for them, but I don't have any reason not to trust their proxy extension. </TEXT>

You can read about H 3345 [HERE.](http://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess122_2017-2018/bills/3345.htm)

This law should be opposed by everyone, even the extremely religious. 

If you're a die hard Catholic, do you really want a fucking Presbyterian teacher filling your kids heads with protestant shit all day at school? 

If you're a Baptist, do you really want a Muslim teacher trying to make your kids face Mecca and pray to Allah 5 times a day? 

This opens the door for the teacher to teach his or her specific religious viewpoint in class. That is simply unacceptable.

Man, I wish that were the case. Unfortunately, I've lived in the south for damn near 30 years. Hopefully will be moving soon!

 I would be more than happy to discuss something more substantial

I think having a conversation about all the ridiculous things theists believe, whether it's a talking snake or 77 virgins for martyrs, and then comparing them with all the realities that theists deny, like climate change, is a very valid and substantial conversation.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Christians find dead men coming back to life, virgins getting pregnant and talking snakes believable, but evolution and climate change are too far fetched. Joseph Smith had 40+ wives, one of which was 14, and the LDS church calls him a prophet, but gay marriage is an abomination. Unbelievable! </TITLE>

<TEXT> It always amuses me when religious folks attempt to act like evolution and climate change are just such far fetched theories and that they are too extreme to be taken seriously or believed. Yet these very same people who are rejecting evolution and climate change as if they are laughable believe in talking snakes, virgins getting pregnant, dead men coming back to life, sky fairies, etc. 

You want to talk to me about how climate change is too much to believe when you're legit waiting around for 2000 year old resurrected Jesus to fucking return in the clouds? HA! 

Also, it's incredible to me when theists, mainly Christians in my region, attempt to act as if they are somehow morally superior to everyone else because of their religion.

Right, you believe in a god who trolled Abraham just to see if he would kill his kid...so moral. Your god considered Lot, who offered up his daughters to be raped before he would allow strangers in his home to be raped, to be a "righteous" man. 

The Mormons want to act as if they are super moral, but their "prophet" was a pedophile who even married other men's wives after he had shipped the men off to do missionary work. 


I suppose when you believe talking snakes and virgin births are within the realm of possibilities, it's easier to disregard realities such as climate change and evolution. I suppose when you believe in a god who demonstrated time and time again in the Old Testament that he is a fucking psychotic mass murderer, it's easy to consider innocent gay people as the true evil in society. 

Crazy world we live in full of crazy people and their delusions.

His campaign includes:

* Decriminalizing marijuana. 
* Ending private parking enforcement in the city. 
* Providing tuition free community college to all ATL public school graduates. 
* End the displacement of city residents to make room for luxury developments. 

Fort has said that "City Hall aint gonna change me; Im gonna change City Hall. 

Check him out! As the revolution continues, we're going to need people in charge like Vincent Fort. 

You can read two articles about his candidacy [here](http://www.clatl.com/news/article/20843801/state-sen-vincent-fort-officially-jumps-into-atlanta-mayoral-race) and [here.](http://georgiastatesignal.com/state-senators-campaign-platform-pushes-free-college-aps-students/)

<TEXT> This whole debate regarding when during pregnancy a woman can and cannot have an abortion is such a distraction. 

Either abortion is wrong, or it's not. At what point during the pregnancy the abortion occurs is irrelevant. 

I'm of the belief that abortion is not wrong, regardless of whether it's 6 weeks or 8 months. 

Why can't we just let women control their own goddamn bodies and move on front debating abortion bills for half the fucking legislative session each term? 

Sadly, considering our nation elected a self proclaimed pussy grabber as President, I fully expect the GOP to continue legislating what women can and cannot do with their own pussies.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Why are you so invested in other people's spending?

Why am I so invested? Maybe because the Catholic Church takes money from individuals who believe they are going to use it to **help people,** and then they turn around and blow the cash on stupid TV ads instead of funding things, like treatment centers, which WOULD help people. 

 and here you are complaining about the very freedom we strive for.

You want to talk about freedom? Freedom is what gives me the ability to be critical of how others spend their money, mate.  </TEXT>

We're not talking about government funding, or government budgets. 

Adelson is a private citizen, and the Catholic Church is a religious institution. 

Had they spent their money on treatment centers and needle exchanges, lives would have been saved. 

Instead, they spent their money running tv ads claiming that weed is the true danger to society. 

That **should** outrage people.

Couldn't that money have been spent on better things, like Narcan, as opposed to running TV ads telling people that *weed* is the real danger to kids?

Adelson pretends to be an anti drug crusader, but all he does is donate massive amounts of money fighting legalization politically. Where are his donations by the millions actually fighting the drug epidemic on the streets? </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's when 2   3 begin to contradict each other, though. God has, relative to time period, declared certain things moral and immoral. Take polygamy for example. If morality isn't relative, then polygamy would be just as immoral in 1840 as it is in 2016. But that's not what the church teaches.

<TEXT> Point out exactly where I am incorrect. 

There is currently one vacancy on the Supreme Court, which Trump will get to fill. That means the divide on the court will be 5 conservative leaning justices, 4 liberals. 

If Kennedy, the only conservative justice that has been even remotely friendly to reproductive rights resigns, then Trump will get to appoint another justice. 

With Kennedy (or Ginsburg) gone, there will be nothing in the way of the court reversing Roe. 

Don't think they would be willing to overturn that many decades of precedent? They did it with Citizens United. That case proves the conservatives on the court don't give a fuck about stare decisis as long as the outcome benefits their agenda.

The Fourteenth Court of Appeals heard the case twice. First, a three judge panel found the arrest and law unconstitutional. Then the state requested an en-banc hearing, which means ALL the judges in the Fourteenth Court of Appeals heard the case. The second go around, the law was deemed constitutional and the original three judge panel's decision was reversed. 

Then, it went to the supreme court. 

William Pryors brief was after the case had been heard en banc and deemed consitutitional by the entirety of the Fourteenth Court of Appeals.

<TEXT> Either abortion is wrong, or it's not. I do not believe that abortion is wrong. It's not my place to tell another what reasons are "acceptable" for abortion. If the government can limit the number of abortions a person can have, what is stopping the government from limiting the number of children a person can have? Reproductive issues **must** remain with the individual.

I don't care if a woman has an abortion at 3 months or 8 months, it's not my call. Either abortion is wrong, or it isn't. If it's wrong, it's wrong at 12 week or 9 months. If it's not wrong, then it's not wrong at 12 weeks or 9 months. 

That's my personal opinion.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Funny you mention that!

There are several Alabama counties who have, in protest of the Supreme Court's decision legalizing gay marriage, refused to issue marriage licenses to any couples, gay or straight, essentially keeping marriage "out of the local government."

Meaning that couples now have to travel across county borders to find a probate judge willing to issue marriage licenses. 

Funny how the GOP wants to throw a fit and make people travel elsewhere when they don't get their way on an issue. </TEXT>

In 2011, there were around 30k people arrested for possession in Colorado. In 2014? Under 5k arrests. Arrests for cultivation and distribution also dropped from around 40k a year to under 5k. [Source.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/03/26/after-legalization-colorado-pot-arrests-plunge/)

The simple truth is this: legalization drastically lowers arrests. Most people aren't growing 1,000 plants in their basement or trying to get high on the public bus. Don't be stupid, you won't get arrested. That's a lot better than getting locked up period.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, if you don't want to vote in the Presidential race, more power to you! A lot of people are disenchanted with our process because of the electoral college, but the electoral college only impacts ONE race, the President. All Senators, all representatives, all Governors, all Mayors, all City Council members and ALL state legislators are elected by popular vote -- and are arguably more important races than the President. 

**At least vote in local races, please.** </TEXT>

Ezekiel 16:49 "Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: : She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy."

<TEXT>  Of course I would. Even if the punishment was something terrible. In fact, the more draconian the punishment, the more likely I would be to sign up.
I would absolutely be willing to be arrested in order to defend the pedophile's ability to confess. I said already, everyone deserves the ability to confess. Everyone. 

And then this.... 

 I honestly do not care if it sickens you are not. The fact that you would deprive someone of the ability to confess to their sins and thereby preserve their immortal soul is the most inhuman thing I've heard in my entire life. You would risk sending someone to Hell just to get a temporary, worldly punishment.



People can apparently defend anything as long as it's about protecting religion... </TEXT>

<TEXT> You seem to not understand that requiring the priest to report child rape does not prevent anyone from confessing. You want pedophiles to be able to confess **without consequences.** I want pedophiles to be able to confess AND face the consequences of his or her actions. 

No matter how you want to frame it, you're going to be hard pressed to find anyone who thinks it's more immoral to "prevent" confession, which isn't what mandatory reporting laws do, than protecting a pedophile. Good luck with that one. 

Protecting sexual abusers in the name of your religion is the most inhuman thing I've ever heard in my entire life.  </TEXT>

I don't think Clinton will push for further legalization, but I don't think she will work to prevent states that have legalized from doing so.

<TEXT> I don't personally view it that way. I'm fine with disagreeing on this, but hear me out: 

The Supreme Court has twice ruled, first in Loving v. Virginia, which legalized interracial marriage and then in Obergfells v Hodges, which legalized gay marriage, that marriage itself is a **fundamental right.**

I don't buy the argument that judges can refuse to grant marriage licenses, which has been ruled a fundamental right, just because they're refusing to grant any marriage licenses, not just same-sex marriage licenses. 

This is almost worse.. not only is the fundamental right of same-sex couples being infringed upon, but the fundamental right of all citizens of those counties to marry is being taken away by a few rogue judges. 


On another note, this brings us to another problematic issue: the practice of electing judges. It's likely these judges will be overwhelmingly re-elected, despite infringing on the rights of the people in their county. To these judges, it's not about following the law... it's about getting elected.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That sounds reasonable, but are you consistent in regard to states rights? For example, if Maryland wanted to legalize abortion up until the day before the fetus is due to be delivered, should Maryland be able to do that under the states rights argument?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are a few ways that campaign finance could be fixed. 

The next President could appoint a replacement for Scalia, and the litmus test should be whether or not that judge wants to overturn Citizens United. 

Or, Congress could initiate a constitutional amendment that would limit the amount corporations and individuals can contribute per cycle. 

I would prefer a change on the court and a reversal by them, as amending our constitution should always be a last resort.  </TEXT>

Bill Weld should have been the top of the ticket for the libertarians. He's more articulate and more intellectual than Johnson, though they were both pretty good governors. Clinton is....meh. Not very excited, but I'll vote for Clinton simply because I want a liberal supreme court. To 2020! </TEXT>

These same Christians who think it's 100% cool to baptize kids at public schools would absolutely shit out the entire chick-fil-a cow if the local muslim imam even tried to come to the school to merely pray with the students.

<TEXT> I see your point. I'm trying to figure out the various articles about these 7 deaths. One article says the medical examiner hasn't linked the deaths to fentanyl yet, then another article says the health authorities have issued a public warning about fentanyl and heroin after these OD's. So confusing. Regardless, in Cuyahoga County alone, there were 52 deaths related to heroin and fentanyl in August. This shit has to end.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Secondly, picketing a church is a good way to get arrested depending on the theopolitical stance of local LEOs. Especially in smaller towns, Jesus salesmen are made men.

A few years back, I think it was during the 2012 primary, Rick Santorum was having a rally at a local church. For context, this rally was held in a city that was [once voted](http://www.onenewsnow.com/church/2016/01/24/and-america-s-most-least-bible-minded-city-is) the most "Bible minded" in the country. 

A friend held up a sign that said "My vagina, my choice," and the word vagina was painted in red. 

I held up a sign that said "tax my weed, reduce my student loan interest." 

Neither of us got arrested, and we were on the sidewalk directly in front of the church. 

Political speech is pretty soundly protected. Any arrest resulting from that type of *peaceful* protest is likely going to result in a costly lawsuit for the city/county.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No wonder that the company that makes fentanyl opposes legalization in Arizona. No wonder the beer lobby has [donated against](http://www.slate.com/blogs/business_insider/2016/09/16/alcohol_distributors_in_massachusetts_fight_against_marijuana_legalization.html) the legalization initiative in Massachusetts. Then you also have this batshit crazy millionaire named Julie Schauer from Pennsylvania who [donated over $1 million dollars against legalization](http://www.weednews.co/anti-marijuana-donor-julie-schauer-thinks-marijuana-causes-murder/) because she believes marijuana turns people into terrorists, like the Tsarnaev brothers. Her words. Not mine. 

Do not let big money dictate the laws of your state any longer, folks.

Registering to vote has **never** been easier. 31 state's + DC offer online voter registration. You can find your state's link [here.](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/electronic-or-online-voter-registration.aspx) 

Here are the links to register to vote online in the states actually voting on RECREATIONAL legalization this November:

<TEXT> This is a terrible response. No wonder the Libertarian party never gets any traction.... 

It's a conflict of interest to support candidates who promise you things, eh? So every millionaire who votes Republican because they promise to lower taxes, in the same way, has a conflict of interest? 

Or is it only the poor you wish to disenfranchise when they support candidates who help their specific situation? 

What you said here is essentially this: "My ideas can never win if poor people are allowed to vote, so I have to find a *creative idea* to disenfranchise them." If your ideas are so shitty you can't win unless you take away people's right to vote, you should never hold elected office.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Eliminating the Dept. of Ed. and returning most education standards to the states would be a disaster. Do you honestly think that states like Mississippi and Texas wouldn't immediately start teaching that Noah's Ark was for real, evolution is BS, creationism is science and that the civil war *wasn't* about slavery? 

If we let all 50 states develop their own curriculum, what happens when a kid from bumfuck Alabama makes it to the University of Chicago and has no clue what about *real* biology or *real* history?

Doing away with national standards would lead to inconsistencies and disparities in education around the country.  </TEXT>

Arizona passed a medical marijuana ballot initiative in 2010. 2010 was a midterm election, and the year that the republicans won big nationwide, and in Arizona. 

If medical marijuana can pass in a midterm election, I think recreational has a very good chance of passing in a presidential election year.  </TEXT>

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_garment) is what the "garments" look like, and [here](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/enhanced/terminal05/2012/5/17/22/enhanced-buzz-17252-1337308805-10.jpg) is a lovely image where you can tell that Romney is a good garment wearing Mormon! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi! I can relate, as healthcare and education are two **huge** issues for me as well. Hell, I voted for Bernie largely because I thought his plans for the two were refreshing. 

However, Bernie did not win. 

My next three huge issues? War, freedom (whether it be CJ reform, MJ legalization, reproductive rights or lgbt rights), and ethics. 

When it comes to war, Johnson and Weld recognize, just as Bernie does, that interventionist, regime change wars have to stop. 

When it comes to all the social issues, Johnson and Weld are on board. 

When it comes to ethics and integrity, Johnson and Weld are spotless compared to Clinton and Trump.

I'm voting for Johnson and Weld because I agree more with them, not because they are perfect.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Several years ago, I spent a lot of time with the Twelve Tribes. They built a Yellow Deli in the city closest to me, and I became close friends with many of their members who worked in the deli. 

Even went to one of their weddings and slept in their bus. They have a cool boat, too. 

I witnessed them spanking their children with a rod like object, but honestly the verbal and psychological abuse was more traumatic, in my view. As the child was being disciplined, the parent would say things like "you will submit to my will/god's will," etc. The whole thing was very creepy. 

A few of the people I knew eventually left the cult, and subsequently told me of molestation stories, etc. For the most part, everyone agreed that overall the "communities" are safe, but it's largely dependent on who your parents are. Just like in the real world, some parents are shit, some parents are great. In a cult, having shit parent is more dangerous though :( </TEXT>

Do you agree that those within the church who rail against moral relativism are hypocrites? 

For example, if plural marriage was ok back in the day, but it's not now, that's moral relativism, as the only difference is time period and the opinion of 13 men who you already agree have made a shit ton of mistakes.

Yet church members will often rail against gay marriage, calling it moral relativism.

In D C 132, which Joseph Smith himself gave as "revelation from God" about how plural marriage was supposed to be practiced, he said that men were not to take plural wives who were already vowed (married) or who weren't virgins. Joseph Smith married both women who had already been married and women who were not virgins.

Hell, he even married a woman and her daughter, which is prohibited in the old testament.

How can you consider him to be a prophet when he broke the very rules he gave and claimed were from God?

<TEXT> Partisan hack? Lol no, I'm a gay person who can see through Trump's pandering bullshit. You can't be against marriage equality nationwide and expect to get my vote. Since when does reversing the gay marriage decision protect gay people? HA You're hilarious. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not just comments, every post updating about the increase in the death count was deleted for at least 30 minutes. Even articles from BBC with no alteration to the title were removed way prior to this sticky.
